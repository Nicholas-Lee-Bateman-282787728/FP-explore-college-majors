2426291,5,B000BMY2K6,"Once in a while I'll see a movie with minimal expectations, and end up being utterly delighted.  This is one of those movies.  The film is the feature film directorial debut of Michael Showalter, who has previously popped up a number of places on TV and film such as THE DAILY SHOW and STELLA SHORTS.  Here is excels on in all three creative tasks.  I firmly believe that this is one of those ""small"" comedies that will build a significant fan base over the course of time.  It is unorthodox in that the lead romantic character truly is not especially attractive or appealing.  We've all seen comedies in which the leading man was supposed to be unattractive, but in fact was a pretty nice looking guy pretending to be unattractive.  Not here:  Michael Showalter might be an extraordinarily nice guy, but here he simply is not hot.  He isn't merely unattractive; he has terribly posture, moves awkwardly, and dresses horribly.  Much of this is achieved by make up, wardrobe, or acting, but the point is that when we look at him we really do see an unattractive guy, and this is crucial to the film's success.

See, Elliot Sherman, Showalter's character, is a Baxter.  As the movie explains at the beginning, a Baxter is the guy in romantic comedies who is always left by the girl at the altar when she is reunited with her true love.  Ralph Bellamy in HIS GIRL FRIDAY is a Baxter.  Bill Pullman in SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE is a Baxter.  In other words, they are always the guy you know the girl won't end up with.  In THE BAXTER, Elliot meets the very pretty Caroline Swann, whom he meets through his quintessentially Baxter job of accountant.  Inexplicably, they hit it off, get engaged, and plan their marriage.  Inevitably, Caroline's high school sweetheart reenters the picture and we all wonder if this signals the end of their engagement and the reassertion of Elliot's Baxter-hood.  Meanwhile, at the height of his anxiety over the reappearance of the old boyfriend, Elliot meets Cecil, an unpolished but extremely cute temp he met the same day he met Caroline.  Of course, as he talks with her and tells Cecil all about his troubled relationship, everyone in the house desires him to get together with Cecil rather than Caroline.  Michelle Williams, who is best known for her role in DAWSON'S CREEK, does a great job of looking as mousy and unattractive as it is possible for her to look, though her irrepressibly cute face and great smile is impossible to hide.  With her dark and short, she bears a striking resemblance to Janeane Garafalo (which I definitely mean as a compliment-Janeane has gotten a lot of mileage out of being unglamorous, but she really does have one of the great smiles on the planet).

There is a great supporting cast of mainly unknown performers.  Most will know Paul Rudd from films like CLUELESS and his other work, but many will be unfamiliar to most.  Michael Ian Black was funny as Elliot's close friend who was a bit clueless in his own way, but the best supporting job by far was by the dwarf actor Peter Dinklage, who was great in THE STATION AGENT.  Most performances by dwarfs are funny primarily being performed by a dwarf (though Tony Cox is a notable exception).  Dinklage, by contrast, is quite funny here, as much by his subtle gestures.  He had some great visual reactions to things that happened in his scenes, and the way he walked back and forth in front of Elliot's building was very funny.  Casting dwarf actors is always difficult, but I hope he finds more roles in the future.  I also like the way that he plays his roles with dignity.  You never get the sense with him that anyone is making fun of him.

I saw this at a preview in Chicago, and the audience laughed hard all the way through the film.  I think most film goers will do so.  I was absolutely stunned when I saw that Roger Ebert gave the film two stars.  More and more over the years I've come to distrust his assessments of movies.  He not only underrates good movies; he gives absurdly good ratings to awful movies.  Remember his 3-star rating of GARFIELD?  I'm not sure how to account for the growing quirkiness of his ratings.  I've wondered about the conditions he sees films.  He may receive screeners and watch movies primarily on DVD.  If that is the case, he could have seen this without an audience.  In his review he compares THE BAXTER poorly to A 40-YEAR OLD VIRGIN, which I think is the weaker of the two films by a considerable margin.  And the audience laughed much harder at THE BAXTER.  So, I strongly urge anyone wanting to see a good comedy to ignore Ebert and check this out.  I promise that very few people are going to be disappointed.",1126224000,15,4675,4.579518072289156
2426352,3,B000BMY2K6,"I was initially sold on this movie because its created by the people who did Wet Hot American Summer. Obviously an A+ right? Meh, not so much. The movie lacks in humor and only gets giggles out periodically. That is? If you're still watching. I'm only biased for this review because of actress Michelle Williams. Every movie she does she just shines in, As if a security blanket saying ""we will get through this together"" .. Her performance was quirky and adorable. If anything, rent it for her.

2426353,5,B000BMY2K6,"I have yet to find anyone who has heard of this film. It went right to my top ten of all time. About five times viewing with different friends/family and everyone liked it.
Michael Showalter, in my mind a comedic genius, plays a happless bachelor with no prospects. Spell that ""nerd accoutnant"" who reads the dictionary for entertainment. Elizabeth Banks is in perfect character as his fiance with whom he has absolutely zero chemistry nor a single thing in common.
The audience knows the second the adorable Michelle Williams ""Cecile Mills"" enters the picture, that they are perfect for one another.  I have always thought she is among the best and brightest stars in the business. She really shines in this film and anyone would fall in love with her purely delightful character. AND...she sings!!",1370736000,2,799,4.9185185185185185
2426354,5,B000BMY2K6,This is overall a great movie.  Lots of laughs and a great plot.  A must see for any fans of indie movies.,1356307200,,106,3.772727272727273
2426355,4,B000BMY2K6,Funny movie and I love Michael! Came fast and in good condition. I would recommend seeing this movie if you are also a fan. Nothing to special but like I said HUGE fan of Michael,1353196800,,178,4.114285714285714
2426356,1,B000BMY2K6,I'm not really sure why I bought a movie I had never seen. It's embarrassingly bad. The quality of the dvd was fine though.,1304121600,,123,4.166666666666667
2426357,4,B000BMY2K6,"It really helps if you can relate to the main character. You see, The Baxter is less of a romantic comedy that it is a romantic indie with some dry humor. But for what it lacks in a somewhat lackluster original story, the film makes up for with some great characters, some great scenes, and a splendid cast. The movie isn't overtly funny, but the humor derives from the characters, which makes it all the more funny when they do come around. For example, and spoiler warning, when Elliot finally conquers his 'Baxter' status and declares his love for his love, an old college friend of hers comes up to them at that very moment, knowing that this type of incident is what has messed him up before, Elliot runs after the guy chasing him away. Trust me, it's funnier when you actually see it.

Overall, being a fan of Michael Showalter, I was pleased with what I found in a movie directed, written, and starring him. It's a good debut, and while I sadly don't expect we'll see another project like this from him again, it certainly speaks to his talents, both in playing the funny, and the serious emotional sides of the character. the movie may feel long at times, but it is worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of Showalter's.",1279411200,,1231,4.471111111111111
2426358,4,B000BMY2K6,It's a great movie for fans of Stella.  A lot of dry humor and acting so terrible and corny that you must laugh.,1217548800,2,112,3.869565217391304
2426359,5,B000BMY2K6,"The Baxter represents a substantial departure from the absurdist fare of The State and Wet Hot American Summer, but it works so well that fans of these past related works may stop demanding that it conform to those old standards of loopiness. Panned by nearly all movie critics, The Baxter was a film it seemed no one was willing to take on its own terms. It's both a tribute to and sly parody of the old screwball comedy form, which found its apogee in Billy Wilder's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Apartment-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0010AN7Z4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Apartment (Collector's Edition)</a>, and to which The Baxter throws at least a few nods. Writer and director Michael Showalter as Elliot Sherman is innocent and awkward but also brimming with a subversive lunacy just beneath his mannered exterior. No performance is wasted in the film, with Justin Theroux's cornball leading-man charm, Michelle Williams's swoon-inducing quiet cool, Elizabeth Banks's perfectly balanced urbane affectations. And then there's Paul Rudd, who steals one of the better scenes of the film (it involves an inexplicable social game, and is probably one of the ten funniest things I've ever seen). What I really like about this movie is that Showalter knows how to indulge our schlockier sentiments without forgoing wit and maturity.",1209859200,,1381,5.70873786407767
2426360,5,B000BMY2K6,"This is one of those films that I caught on cable and on first viewing, I thought it was a cute romantic comedy. But then I saw it again and I laughed hysterically. By the time I picked up the DVD, it was in my Top Ten Fav Films list, which is a tough list to get into I might add as I am quite a cinephile. Writer/Director/Star Michael Showalter plays Elliot Sherman, the self-described ""Baxter"" who as he describes it, is the guy in a romantic comedy who's nice but ultimately wrong for the leading lady. Showalter is an alum of The State, Stella, and Wet Hot American Summer, and is absolutely hilarious as the ""Nice Guy Finishing Last."" Elizabeth Banks plays said leading lady and Justin Theroux, Banks' character's ex-boyfriend, the leading man. Michael Ian Black (another alum of The State, Stella, and W.H.A.S.) plays Elliot's best friend and steals several scenes in the film. Then there's Michelle Williams, who plays Elliot's temp secretary Cecil, who is obviously perfect for him. Anyway, my suggestion is to rent the movie, watch it a couple of times and tell me I'm wrong about it being one of the best romantic comedies in years.",1209254400,,1143,4.635467980295567
2426361,3,B000BMY2K6,"A ""Baxter"" is basically a loser, the guy who not only never gets the girl, but has to hear others applaud when he loses her to hero of the story.  And since ""getting the girl"" is basically the same as ""getting the story"", the ""Baxter"" is fated to become the footnote in the movie.  The conceit behind ""The Baxter"" is that an entire romantic comedy has been written around the genre's most disposable character type (the guy that the movie's hero beats out in the last 5 minutes of the movie).  Unfortunately, the conceit is something of a Baxter itself.

The story follows our Baxter, Eliot Wilbur Sherman in the few weeks before his doomed marriage to an unbelievably beautiful, intelligent and successful woman named Caroline (Elizabeth Banks - crazy Beth from ""40 year Old Virgin"").  The script doesn't do much to explain how Eliot managed to land Caroline (or is that ""how Caroline got stuck with Eliot?"") because there's no point to that.  We pretty much know how the movie is going to end - the script beats us to the punch by opening the story at the altar, when Eliot does indeed lose Caroline to Bradley, her former too-good-to-be-true boyfriend.  The twist is that the story also offers us an offbeat musician named Cecil who's fated to become Eliot's true love once he's realized that there is life after Baxter-hood.  The story then re-winds back to those precious weeks before the wedding when we see Bradley slowly reenter Caroline's life and lay the seeds for his triumph at Eliot's altar.

The problem with this flick: like Eliot, it's sort of a Baxter itself.  As the story progresses, Bradley edges Eliot out of the way, and since the story is told mostly from his POV, it's soon as marginalized as Eliot.  It didn't take long before I began to feel as if there was some other movie going on somewhere else telling the exact same story from Brad's POV.  Unfortunately, unlike Eliot, ""The Baxter"" doesn't have a Cecil of its own, a redeemer of a sort to save it from its incipient Baxterhood.

""The Baxter"" unfortunately is successful only in proving just why Baxters shouldn't get the girl or our attention.",1177027200,,2125,4.68010752688172
2426427,3,B000BMY2K6,"The Baxter starts where most romantic comedies end: the leading man charges into the wedding scene to declare his love for the heroine--just as she is about to marry someone else. They run into each other's arms and live happily ever after. This movie leaves the ""stars"" of most romantic comedies to their own devices and instead follows the Baxter (the man the leading lady was willing to settle for since she couldn't be with her true love). So begins the story of Elliot Sherman (played by writer/director Michael Showalter), a tax accountant who never manages to get the girl.

A fan of romantic comedies, Showalter hoped to give a nod to the genre's zany movies of the forties with The Baxter. For inspiration, Showalter also looked to the modern embodiment of romantic comedies: Sleepless in Seattle. The idea for The Baxter was born when Showalter wondered what happened to Bill Pullman's character in Sleepless--the man Meg Ryan left to be with Tom Hanks.

Elliot is ready to give up on relationships until he meets Caroline Swann (Elizabeth Banks), a glamorous magazine editor. Elliot and Caroline are preparing for their upcoming nuptials when Caroline's high school sweetheart Bradley (Justin Theroux) returns. As Elliot desperately tries to avoid another rejection he runs into Cecil Mills (Michelle Williams), a unique office temp. With Cecil's help, Elliot realizes that he needs to take a risk and assert himself if he wants to stop being a Baxter. A series of comical catastrophes follow only to prove that, in the end, nice guys can finish first. In short, The Baxter is a romantic comedy for anyone who has ever been dumped.

This movie is hilarious and had this reviewer laughing from beginning to end. The Baxter features an excellent cast--from the leading roles down to the minor characters--, which is given every opportunity to shine. As Elliot becomes convinced that Caroline will dump him, Showalter perfectly conveys the mayhem and desperation Elliot feels as he tries to keep Caroline away from Bradley in the hopes of living happily ever after.

The Baxter is, first and foremost, about a Baxter who has no luck in love. But it is also a movie for anyone who suspects they might be slightly out of step with the world at large. This movie focuses on the quirky people that make life interesting but don't always get leading roles in Hollywood. Every character in The Baxter is at least a little neurotic, a little odd. It's these quirks that make the characters, and the movie, so lovable.",1175299200,,2518,4.889929742388759
2426428,4,B000BMY2K6,"Nothing fancy, nothing being blown up, but a great movie for people who love dry humor. If you get the humor you will love the movie if you are totally lost with dry humor I seriously doubt you will enjoy this film.  Worth the price.",1171411200,3,233,4.177777777777778
2426429,5,B000BMY2K6,"""The Baxter"" was recommended to me by some friends, and I already knew I liked Michelle Williams, so I took a chance and rented it. I was so pleasantly surprised by this movie that I want to purchase it now!

Quirky and hilarious, unexpected and yet reassuringly predictable, this movie is absolutely perfect in every way. The cast is top-notch with lots of faces that you'll find vaguely familiar; the writing and comedic timing are superb; the filming is artsy but not pretentious; the plot is a creative twist on a familiar theme. One of the funniest, most unique, and well put-together films I have seen in a long time.

Sometimes these ""independent"" films can be a shot in the dark, and either be offensive or crappy or both, but not Baxter. I watched this with my in-laws, my parents and my husband, and ALL of us laughed: men, women, 20's, 30's, 40's and 50's, we all loved it! I whole-heartedly recommend ""The Baxter"" to everyone!",1155168000,2,938,4.644578313253012
2426430,5,B000BMY2K6,"Okay, first of all, all the other reviews here keep referring to the cast of ""Stella"" which I've never seen (and maybe that's why the main character of this movie was so fresh for me), but nobody seemed to pick up on the fact that almost the ENTIRE cast of MTV's sketch comedy show The State shows up somewhere in this movie (really, the only notable exceptions being Beth Littleford and that other little guy that played Beth Littleford's ex-husband/host of Viva Variety).  I loved The State, but I knew they could never support such zany off-the-wall premises for a full-length picture.  So I was expecting a much more ""mundane"" plot.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that within a very ""everyday"" analysis of romance, Michael Showalter crammed a lot of very insightful, biting, sometimes almost personally painful, but also very funny comedy.  This is a movie that requires intellect and a simple appreciation of quiet artistic style to properly enjoy.  I'm guessing the guy that wrote the review that said he left the theater after 15 minutes doesn't fit the bill.  I actually enjoyed this movie as much or more the second time I watched it, and I am planning to buy a copy.  This movie is what smart film-lovers wish films could be all the time.  Michelle Williams is perfect as the girl who may not look as good from across the bar as her female counterpart, but turns out to be the kind of girl that more complex guys can't live without once they meet her.  (I am silently biting my fist right now.)  Kudos as well to the rest of the cast of The State who show that they can seamlessly slip right out of their zany slapstick roles and into these quiet expertly-delivered supporting comedic roles.  I kept wondering if the ""I Wanna Dip My Balls In It!""-guy from The State was going to show up, and he DID in the last 30 seconds of the film!  Michael Showalter, I started loving your work as Doug, the eloquent, generation-X loser (""So Dad, you think smoking a cigarette with me is all it takes to fix the generation gap 'twixt you and me?  This scene is beat, says I...I'm outta heeeeeeeeyyyyaaa!"", etc.), but I'm still loving it because of this film!",1151107200,2,2159,4.576623376623377
2426431,3,B000BMY2K6,"There are two very enjoyable things about ""The Baxter."" One is the marvelous original music by composer Theodore Shapiro, especially the final track, ""Hopeful."" The other is imagining the many other ways this film could be done.

The characters are well drawn and the script is tight as a drum. That makes the film very nearly actor-proof. If this were a studio picture (and this were 1996), Ben Stiller might be cast as Elliott, Cameron Diaz as his fiance, and Drew Barrymore or Joan Cusack as the sensible, soulful temp. (I'm not saying that would be a good film; only that many actors could be slotted into these precisely imagined roles without much difficulty.) Or imagine (even) seeing it played by an all-Australian cast. No matter: the story would still hum along like well-oiled machinery.

Yes, the script is a delight. Unfortunately, the visuals are no match for it. The film is boxy, poorly lit, and dull. I had a hard time keeping my eyes on the screen. (Come to think of it, ""The Baxter"" would make a fine radio play.)

The cast is, by and large, a treat, with some seldom-seen actors getting to show their chops. Michelle Williams and Justin Theroux are particularly strong. These fine players are undermined, however, by the performance of Mr. Showalter (who also wrote and directed) in the lead. As played here, Elliott is hyper-annoying: full of physical tics, dull, and so homely it is not believable that either of these smart, attractive women would voluntarily spend more than three minutes in his presence. It doesn't help that he croaks his lines in a voice like an injured parrot. Showalter doesn't act so much as he telegraphs -- with excruciating deliberateness -- various states of panic, embarrassment, and quirkiness.

A wonderful script that should rightly be brought to teeming life. In this rendering, however, we have to settle for a persistent vegetative state.",1144108800,,1896,4.915625
2426432,5,B000BMY2K6,"The Baxter

This is probably one of the most underrated films I've seen yet, considering that it's style is basically generic romantic comedy (meaning the makers underrated it themselves), it's gotten little to no viewership... I never even heard of it before I  picked it up off the wall (it was next in line).

Anyway, you know all those movies about how the man and the woman love each other but can't figure it out, so the woman almost marries the wrong person before the man crashes the wedding and sweeps her away?  Well this is the story of the guy left at the altar, and his search for the ""right woman"" as well when his character is defined as the safe, content ""nice guy"" that women are supposed to erroneously try to marry when their lively romantic relationships go awry.  Basically that's the long way of saying that this guy is an accountant who spends his time reading the dictionary as a private pleasure, and now he realizes that he'd like to actually get the girl too.

What's absolutely wonderful about this film is that Elliot knows that his problem is that he's such a harmless nice guy, but he knows that being a harmless nice guy is a really great thing to be if you don't take into account that that means losing a lot of relationships because women are more interested in romance risk-takers.  So he has to battle his own personality with his own personality while his friends give him TERRIBLE advice that sounds good (we've been there, now haven't we?), he surrounds himself with completely superficial people because superficiality is the only way he knows to fit in, and he totally doesn't notice the direct and not-so-subtle advances from the ""right girl"" who is, also, way too nice to take risks as well.

In short, it's an absolutely delightful sort of aside in the whole romantic comedy industry, but still uses a lot of the tropes and techniques usual to the form to keep it simple and enjoyable for everyone.

2426433,3,B000BMY2K6,"The brilliant Michael Showalter (Stella) stars as Elliot Sherman, who tells the story about how he became ""The Baxter"". He met a woman named Caroline, played by the ever so lovely Elizabeth Banks (Daltry Calhoun, The 40 Year Old Virgin) and how he fell in love with her. He also proposed to her. The scene stealer in the movie would have to go to Michelle Williams (Brokeback Mountain, Dawson's Creek) playing Cecil Mills....she was the best in this. Elliot hears about Caroline's old boyfriend named Bradley, played by Justin Theroux (Mulholland Dr., Charlies Angels: Full Throttle) and who comes back into town and is also getting married but Elliot thinks that Bradley wants to steal Caroline away from her. He even gets advice from his friend played by awesome Michael Ian Black (Tv's ED, Partner(s) )...this guy rocks. Showalter even has the 3rd member of Stella, David Wain (Along Came Polly) who plays Elliot soon to be brother in law. It's extremely low key funniness...someone pointed out Napoleon Dynamnite and I agree but Elliot is no Dynamite, he's just Elliot. Peter Dinklage (Elf, The Station Agent) has an extremely funny small (whiched it was a bigger part) role as the wedding planner Hedges.

Comedy Channel legend Michael Showalter wrote, directed, produced and starred this clever flic, along with co-stars Michelle Williams (""Dawson's Creek"") and Elizabeth Banks. While the movie has moments when it reminds of ""Something About Mary"", it has sufficient weight to almost get to a level comparable to now-cult movie ""Napoleon Dynamite"", in a sense, meeting the two half way. A lot of fun to watch and highly recommendable (even if you are allergic to chick flics).",1138060800,,627,4.980952380952381
2426435,5,B000BMY2K6,"Oddly enough, I ended up watching this movie with my Dad.  We don't always think that the same things are funny, but we both had the same reaction: ""this is either the worst movie I have ever seen, or the best!""  The Baxters/Baxterettes go awkwardly through their lives.  So much so that it makes one cringe.  Think of scenes from The Office (British or American versions). The Baxters/ Baxterettes are so earnest and pathetic.  It is like watching a car accident.  You can't believe someone would act that way.  A guy whose last time saying up late was during finals week in Business school?  A guy who does not know anything about beer?  Two people who read the dictionary for fun?  When will the madness end!  I admit at that point I was worried about the rest of the movie.  I couldn't tell whether the writing was tongue in cheek.  Is it possible that the Baxter himself was in on the joke, hmmmmmm?  Were we the ones not getting it?  I don't know when it happened, but I began to find their habits and mannerisms endearing.  I thought ""my God, they such geeks, but they are trying so hard to find love!""

This movie brings home the points that there is someone out there for everyone, and it is never to late to find new love or rekindle old passion. Elliot, the Baxter in the title, has narrowly missed finding the love of his life several times, or has he?  The old flame of every one of his girlfriends has  stolen her right out from underneath him.  He keeps trying to find love, but could he be sabatoging himself?  Can he break free of the past?  This movie is an interesting study in coincidences.  What series of events had to happen in just the right sequence for someone to fall in love, or get dumped, or run into an old flame, or all three at the same time, This movie shows how through a series of misadventures and coincidences Eilliot learns about life and love until he finds the love of his life.

As to the humor, because of the writing, acting, and clothes, my Dad was convinced that the movie was set in England.  It took me a bit too.  It wasn't until the words Brooklyn and apartment were said a few times that the debate decisively ended.  The writing and delivery was very Monty Python: slapstick humor and intelligent riffs on life.  Plus, the comic delivery by the two leads was excellent.  I think Michelle Williams did an especially good job, considering I have never seen her play a character like this one.  She really lets loose her inner Nerd.  My favorite scene takes place the only time Cecil and Elliot are in the bedroom together (no not that kind of scene!).  I won't spoil it except to say words can't describe the laughter!  And that is why The Baxter is one of the best movies I have ever seen.",1136851200,,2740,4.394422310756972
2426476,5,B000BMY2K6,"Michael Showalter's feature film directorial debut will probably come as somewhat of a surprise to longtime fans of ""The State,"" ""Stella,"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer.""  While some of the absurdity associated with those projects is in place in ""The Baxter,"" for the most part, this is a sweet comedy in the vein of 70s/80s Woody Allen territory.

Showalter plays Elliot Sherman, ""the baxter,"" a term used for the nice guy that always seems to lose the girl to the more passionate ""bad"" boy who pops up in romantic comedies.  Quite an original idea for a movie, many of the same cast members from ""Wet Hot American Summer"" (Michael Ian Black, Zak Orth, Elizabeth Banks, Joe LoTroglio, AD Miles) pop up in small supporting roles.  David Wain is also here doing his thing -- which lends itself to one of the funniest scenes in the film.  The great thing about ""The Baxter"" is that the absurd comedy aspects of the film never infringe on the sweet and serious nature of the story.  It's a fine balance of the two.

The only complaints about the DVD is there are basically no special features aside from four brief ""blooper"" clips.  It would've been nice to have an audio commentary by Showalter, and maybe either a short ""making of"" or some deleted scenes -- but, that's not here.  However, the movie is worth owning and gets better with repated viewings.",1136592000,7,1352,4.670886075949367
2426477,5,B000BMY2K6,"The Baxter is about a nice guy named Elliot Sherman (Showalter). He's the kind of guy who doesn't get the girl in the movies. He reads the Dictionary for fun and is an accountant by trade (working for the second best firm in New York City no less) - it doesn't get much more ordinary than that. He is a nave, idealistic dreamer in the same vein as Miranda July's character in Me and You and Everyone We Know. The Baxter champions nice guys and the unsung heroes who may not be dynamic leading man material but fascinating in their own right.

Michael Showalter is excellent as the ultimate nice guy/doormat. He walks through life with a perpetually cheery, glazed facial expression that is priceless. With his pursed lips and oblivious nature, he's like a live-action version of Charlie Brown. He has such an expressive face - ideal for all of his funny looks and reaction shots when something doesn't go his way: wide eyes when surprised and narrowed when suspicious.

The always watchable Michelle Williams is absolutely endearing as Cecil the temp. Even though she is made to look mousy, her natural beauty and charisma come through. Her character is infinitely more interesting than Caroline and this is due in large part to Williams. There is something about her, an old fashioned quality in what her character wears, her inhibitions and her naivete that is refreshing in this day and age with actresses like Angelina Jolie who reveal too much so that there is no mystique to them. This makes them less interesting to watch.

Five minutes into The Baxter and it already has you immersed in this fascinating and idiosyncratic world. You find yourself already caring about what happens to Elliot. He is instantly endearing and engaging. And this extends to other characters via extensive use of close-ups so that we can see them emoting - essential for a character-driven movie like this one. In the first five minutes it is readily apparent that is a wonderfully personal, independent movie.

There is a brief ""Blooper Reel"" that features four scenes where actors blow their lines. It's amusing but hardly earth shattering. Where is the audio commentary or obligatory making of featurette?",1136419200,6,2193,4.871313672922252

If you are looking for a great date movie or even just something to watch, this movie is well worth picking up. Trust me you won't be disappointed",1136332800,,294,4.175438596491228
2426479,4,B000BMY2K6,"How many times have you seen a movie where the girl is about to marry the wrong guy and the right guy shows up at the last moment and stops the wedding from taking place?  I think ""The Graduate"" may well have been the first time I saw that particular commonplace of romantic comedy, but there are a few times that the formula is played with to good effect (""My Best Friend's Wedding"" comes to mind).  ""The Baxter"" is another attempt to take a new look at an old situation because it is really about the fellow left standing at the altar, a.k.a. the wrong guy.  Therefore, the ""Baxter"" is the guy who does not get the girl and this film from writer-director-actor Michael Showalter seeks to rectify that result.

Showlater is Elliot Sherman, a CPA, whom we first meet when his wedding to Caroline Swann (Elizabeth Banks) is interrupted by her high school sweetheart, Bradley Lake (Justin Theroux), who has jetted in from Malta because he has a few things we wants to say to the woman in the wedding dress.  We then go back to the beginning, when Elliot met Caroline, only to have this immediately revised to slightly earlier that same day when Elliot met Cecil Mills (Michelle Williams), his temp secretary for the day.  Elliot and Cecil make a connection (they both are reading the dictionary for fun), but then Caroline walks in and he ends up dating and becoming engaged to her instead.  We know what he sees in her, but what she sees in him is not at all clear, but that is the way these stories go.  That would explain why their connection is made off screen, because it is necessary to get us from point A to point B (just like how King Kong gets from Skull Island to New York City in a cut rather than on that little boat).

There are a series of flashbacks when we find out that Elliot has been the Baxter for a long time as we watch him lose the girl in high school, college, and graduate school.  So when Bradley shows up, having not seen Caroline in years, he knows what is coming.  Elliot tries to fight back, but he is a Baxter and therefore doomed.  But in this knowledge that what is going to happen is going to happen Elliot actually finds his salvation and when he go back to the beginning there is one rather significant addition in terms of what Elliot says before Bradley makes his grand entrance.

This ends up being something of a surprise since given the prologue to the film I was really expecting ""The Baxter"" would focus on the aftermath of being left at the altar and how Elliot picks up the pieces and ends up finding true love.  Instead we go back to the beginning of Elliot's relationship with Caroline and watch the train wreck play out, but with a twist.  Clearly Caroline and Bradley are constrained to playing to the types they represent, which is why their characters are ultimately comic rather than tragic, but that is also the main reason that Cecil stands out as being a much better fit for Elliot.  Lots of people go to Dartmouth, but how many people read the dictionary as their choice for literature?  We know they are perfect for each other and she knows it, but Elliot is a bit slow because, after all, he is a Baxter.

This 2005 film plays as more of a farce than a satire, and the paradox is that Elliot has to deserve his fate as a Baxter but somehow be able to break free of the role in the end.  That requires Showlater to try and have it both ways and have a lot of the good will we feel towards his character to be established by his circumstances rather than his characteristics.  I checked out this movie because of Michelle Williams and she is cute and quirky without becoming odd.  The other standout performance in the film is Peter Dinklage as a gay wedding planner named Benson Hedges.  If you have seen ""The Station Agent,"" ""Elf,"" ""Threshold,"" or anything else, it will not surprise you that Dinklage steals pretty much every scene in which he appears.",1134950400,,3910,4.4239888423988845
2426480,3,B000BMY2K6,"The Baxter is funny and sweet. It's not as good as the Stella shorts, but everyone is there. An enjoyable comedic indie movie.",1134691200,2,126,4.521739130434782
2426481,3,B000BMY2K6,"The Baxter is Michael Showalter's exegesis on the chronic leavability of guys who get ditched at the altar.  Is it fate?  Pure lack of game?  Or do these guys just have a knack for clinging onto women fate has earmarked for another?

Fortunately, Showalter has seen fit not to inflict upon us yet another blithe romp where the nerdy guy finally gets the clue to ditch the horned-rims for contacts and all of a sudden he's the next coming of Brad Pitt.  And the result is a quirky comedy with an original and fresh perspective of a classic storyline.

Where the film neatly avoids falling the course of a modern Pygmalion myth, however, the inescapable notion that our Baxter, Eliot (Showalter), is playing a role in someone else's story haunts the film, leaving us somewhat apathetic to whether or not his bride will ultimately abandon him or not.  While Eliot blusters and fumes about the reappearance of his bride-to-be's ex-flame, Bradley (Justin Theroux), we can't help but wish we were seeing Bradley's campaign to reclaim his lost love.  After all, it's clear that Eliot's redemption from Baxterhood lies not in his remedial machismo, but rather in his chick-picker.  As it would be problematic to watch a war movie about a guy who's (although unwittingly) on a mission to help out the Third Reich, it's little more compelling to watch a film about a guy who spends the whole time fighting for a woman who's wrong for him.  By the time Eliot clues in to the identity of his soul's lost love, the film has been so preoccupied with the wrong girl that there's barely enough time to tap the right one on the shoulder, much less fight for her.

In the meantime, some deftly penned characters, enthusiastic performances and truly funny moments fuel the underpowered storyline.  Showalter infuses enough intelligence into Eliot to make him sympathetic, and a parade of great supporting talent makes gems out of several moments.  As Showalter himself admits, ""The best line is always an improvised line,"" and The Baxter definitely has its fair share.  And it is in these moments that The Baxter tastes satisfying in the theatre.  We're just a little hungry on the way home.",1132099200,4,2172,4.801075268817204
2426482,5,B000BMY2K6,"This movie was spectacular. All those comments of negative(and poor grammar abilities)shall be ignored. Showalter captured the character to a ""T"" of a Baxter, the sweet one who meets the uptight-girl-who-just-doesn't/can't-appreciate-a-good-thing-when-she's-got-it.

So, along comes miss cutey pie who is, as well, too good to be true. Blah, blah, blah....see it and judge for yourselves. I already have. Two thumbs up. An A+. Showalter can do no wrong in my eyes/mind.",1129507200,4,469,5.7

He should have cast someone else, the way he played the character made it hard to watch.  Just a so-so comedy about a Baxter (someone who is a loser and is a compromise to ""true love"") and his life as the guy who never gets the girl.  This is just a kind of bland film and I felt like I wasted my time when I could have watched something else.
