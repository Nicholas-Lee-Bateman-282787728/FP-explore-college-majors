6453798,5,B00KYJHSJI,This book builds on my prior classes and is very clear and accurate.  The games and exercises dealing with chi are superb.  This could be a good entry for beginners and experienced Qigong people.  5 starss,1428192000,4,205,4.638888888888889
6453799,5,B00KYJHSJI,"I got a German version three years ago and Im very happy to get an English version as well. I have been practicing it almost every single day ever since I had it. I just love it. It really gives me a good start of the day and a calm ending in the evening. It is simple and easy to follow. You don't have to spend extra hours to watch and learn. Just turn it on and follow them and in a few minutes, you are in a mood of openness and energy flow. I love that feeling, which makes my whole day calm and blissful.

I do notice, that some cycles are the same in both AM Qigong and PM Qigong. But whats wrong with that? This single DVD is not for the purpose to provide us with huge variety of practices, but practically for us to be energetic during the day and enjoy calmness during the night, which I believe they kept their promise well. Actually that's what I love? You don't have to spend extra energy to get familiar but still you can get amazing benefit. You can even view both as one big exercise, some parts are  more appropriate for the day, so they are put in AM Qigong, and some other parts are more appropriate for the night, and they are put  in PM Qigong. While the parts that are both fine for morning and evening, are simply in both exercises.

The setting is beautiful and the music is superb. The lady that accompany Robert Peng is Barbaras Becker. She is a popular figure in German. As far as I know from the introduction, she is also Robert Pengs student since 2007. It is like a teacher leading a student to practice Qigong together. And following AM/PM Qigong DVD, I feel like practcing along with my own Qigong teacher.

And I LOVE the bonus Lotus Meditation. When I am easy with my time, like on Saturday or Sunday, I like to meditate another 20 minutes following the beautiful music with Roberts soft voice: ""Lotus meditation, find a comfortable position, sitting cross-legged, or on a chair, or simply lying down... and bring the beautiful lotus to my heart to empower my loving energy. As a matter of fact, this is a DVD with very generous offering. Good Morning Qigong and Good Evening Qigong plus Self Massage, Awakening Awareness and Inner Smile and Nourishing Qi at the end of both exercises, Lotus Meditation, and an interview between Barbara Becker and Robert Peng. Thats a lot of stuff in one DVD!

Im grateful that they made this beautiful Am/Pm Qigong DVD so that I can practice with Master Robert Peng every day.",1418688000,15,2446,4.3766519823788546
6453800,2,B00KYJHSJI,"Buyer beware. Although this was released by Sounds True in Aug. 2014, it is not a new production from Sounds True, which was not apparent until viewing.  It was produced in 2010 by a company called Wellbewell. Looking this up online, it appears to be a German co. that produces dvd's, many of which feature, at least in the cover photos, a German-American celebrity who is in this dvd with Robert Peng.  The ""p.m"" segment repeats much of the ""a.m."" segment. I had hoped for more of a difference. It seemed to me there was a lot of time on warmups and meditation and not so much on flowing movements. ""Qigong Ecstasy"" , actually produced by Sounds True, which is just Robert Peng (no celebrities),is more to my liking.  I had asked Sounds True to post a video clip from this ""a.m.""/""p.m."" dvd and was assured they were working on it.  That was a month ago and when I last checked, a few days ago, there still was none.  It certainly would have been helpful to see a clip before purchasing, but I received the dvd as a gift.",1411084800,40,1022,4.386243386243386
