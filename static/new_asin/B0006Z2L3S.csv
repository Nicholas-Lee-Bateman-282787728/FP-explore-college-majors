2197144,5,B0006Z2L3S,"My 3-year-old daughter loves Max & Ruby. The somewhat patient big sister, Ruby, spends her time with friends and Bunny Scouts, while her little brother, Max, spends HIS time finding ways to cause mischief. Based on books by Rosemary Wells, these short stories are fun, sweet, and gentle viewing for small children.

The DVDs have an auto-play function, which is handy to the parents or caregiver with the child. The show starts on its own if the menu is left untouched for more than 30 seconds or so. When the episodes are all played out, it goes back to the menu and restarts.

While TV/DVDs should not be used as alternatives to good parenting, the right ones can be helpful in distracting a child while said parent tries to get things done around the home.

I HIGHLY recommend ""Max & Ruby"" of any title. They are all wonderful. [My husband even gets a kick out of Max's antics.]

2197145,3,B0006Z2L3S,"My 4 year old loved the movie, but I bought it on the assumption of it being 12 episodes in length, there are only 6. So, I rewind alot, but disappointed since the editor said 12.",1137456000,2,179,4.0
2197146,5,B0006Z2L3S,"I adore Max & Ruby...My kids & I got hooked when Nick Jr. used to air them but then they stopped airing it for some reason. Or they would show it only twice a week at 6 am...way too early for us. I used the timer on the VCR to tape a bunch of episodes, but I am thrilled that many of the episodes are available on DVD. The colors & clarity of the DVD are well worth paying for. I also have the Christmas DVD & have already pre-ordered the Halloween special. Each DVD comes with 12 episodes, so it is a very good bargain. I hope Rosemary Wells keeps new episodes coming!",1124496000,4,569,4.0

2197148,5,B0006Z2L3S,"Ruby is the patient and gently bossy big sister to Max. These bunnies share loving sibling rivalry as curious Max tries join in on playtime with Ruby and her friend Louise--often to Ruby's dismay!

This 96 minute DVD features 12 different episodes:

Max's Chocolate Chicken - Max and Ruby are looking for Easter Eggs, and whoever finds the most will win the Chocolate Chicken!

Ruby's Beauty Shop - Louise is coming over to play Beauty Shop with Ruby, and Max is going to be their first customer. Will he like looking gorgeous? (A very amusing episode!)

Max Drives Away - When Max drives away in his little red car, Ruby needs to play detective and search for clues to find him.

Camp Out - Ruby wants to camp outside, but Max wants to sleep outside the tent! And he wants to bring a few toys with him...

Ruby's Clubhous - Ruby and Louise are playing in their private clubhouse, but Max doesn't know the meaning of the word ""private"".

Max's Picnic - Ruby and Louise are bird watching before their picnic, but Max is more interested in watching the cupcake in the picnic basket.

The other six episodes in this delightful DVD are:

*Ruby's Merit Badge

*Max's Apple

*Quiet, Max!

*Max Misses the Bus

*Max's Wormcake

*Max's Rainy Day

My 6 year old really enjoys this DVD, sometimes watching it several times a day! There's something mesmerizing about Max and Ruby, and definitely amusing. Kids used to cartoons geared toward older children--or ones with loud, crass, fast-paced action--will find this DVD ""slow"". But for kids (and parents!) who are used to kinder, gentler, and softer cartoons, Max and Ruby is a delight.",1118880000,38,1626,4.716312056737588
2197149,4,B0006Z2L3S,"My 2 1/2 year old son LOVES this DVD, being a big Max & Ruby fan.  My only complaint is that the image of Ruby flying a kite on the ""menu"" list does NOT appear in any episode.  So my son requests time and time again the ""Ruby kite"" story which isn't on this DVD - doesn't make sense.  ""Chocolate Chicken"" and ""Quiet Max"" are his favorites.",1115424000,2,339,4.029850746268656

2197183,5,B0006Z2L3S,"The Springtime is the right time for bird watching, eating chocolate and getting gorgeous-even if you are enlisted by ambush instead of volunteering for the beauty treatments.

2197185,3,B0006Z2L3S,"This is a cute show and my 3-year old enjoys it. But it's quite odd in that no parents are ever seen, and Ruby is basically Max's parent all the time. Max is always with her; she bathes him, fixes his boo-boo's, puts him to bed, includes him in all her activities and play dates (which he is constantly messing up), and teaches him how to do things... all while exercising the patience of Mother Theresa -- she's much more patient that even most parents could be expected to be all the time, much less big sisters. Max seems to be perpetually either antagonistic or clueless, and only ever says one word or phrase at a time. It's not something that would prevent me from wanting kids to watch it, but it is perplexing. I prefer the more realistic family dynamics like in the Berenstain Bears, Little Critter, and Frances.",1307404800,,821,4.48
2197186,5,B0006Z2L3S,Another one that my Great Grandson loves.  He likes Max and Ruby so very much.  Great condition and played beautifully.,1296086400,,119,4.9
2197187,3,B0006Z2L3S,"I love Max and Ruby--But--I noticed the last few days that my 3yr old son has started to drop his r's at the end of words. This video is the culprit! He normally has great vocabulary and pronunciation, so I think we will ban Max and Ruby for a while. By the way, you may have to watch a few episodes before catching on that Ruby has a very interesting dialect, or a speech problem.",1278288000,,381,4.093333333333334
2197188,1,B0006Z2L3S,"I find this a terrible show for young children: Max is a spoiled little brat who always gets what he wants, at the expense of his long-suffering sister. What makes it worse for me is the fact that it is usually quite clear that Max knows he is being bad -- he turns around and ""stage winks"" at the camera when he's going to be willfully defiant or disobedient. I am sorry, but this strikes me as a truly terrible precedent to set for children. He never learns his lesson, he's never sorry, and he's constantly enabled by Ruby and Louise. In addition, his sister can be moderately smug and condescending.

Please don't show your children this show! This is not a set of life lessons we need to be perpetrating.

And... for the record... where are their parents? I come out of this wanting to ring up Child Services and the Supernanny.",1271462400,7,833,4.437908496732026

2197194,4,B0006Z2L3S,"Although adults will surely have many questions (ex: Where are Max and Ruby's parents? Why does Ruby's giggle make you want to take a baseball bat to the TV? etc.), this show does seem to have an almost hypnotic appeal for toddlers. My three-year-old loves it and has practically worn out her copy. I confidently recommend it for very young children. However, I also feel obligated to warn everyone else to leave the room while it's playing, since repeated viewing may cause adult-onset diabetes and/or severe tooth loss.

I have to admit that the stories are really good at teaching manners and behavior and I also enjoy listening to the program as it plays for her.
