8682031,2,B00O4GTYH6,"This is a story about the ""People's Climate March"" of September 2014.  Much of the film is about organizing activities prior to the march, then footage of the march itself.

If you want to effect climate change, clearly all you need is a lot of people carrying signs.  The environmental activists tell the world (probably correctly) that theirs is now the largest ""movement"" in the history of mankind.  But they never bother with a report on how effective they are (absent recessions - apparently the only real deterrent to human GHG emissions - the quantities of the three primary GHGs continue to hit new records every year).  This point is not addressed in the film, but the conclusion is clear: either climate activism is having no effect, or whatever effect it is having is simply being wiped out by an increasing number of people using fossil fuels (by population growth alone, or by emergent quality of life in ""emerging economies"").

Anyway, this film just provides a record of this particular event in 2014 and the hopes and aspirations of the people who think that the lack of US action on mitigation of climate change will be re-shaped in part by protest.  It's not about climate science.
