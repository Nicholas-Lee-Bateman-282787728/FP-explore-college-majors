149388,3,0792843894,"Bert I. Gordon (aka Mr. B.I.G.) decided that enlarging things had been overdone so he decided to shrink his cast in Attack of the Puppet People (aka Fantastic Puppet People).  You hafta love when Gordon has the two leads go to a drive-in to see his Amazing Colossal Man.  John Hoyt plays a lonely doll maker who has invented a machine that shrinks people to doll size.  Hoyt keeps his 'dolls' in suspended animation stored in glass tubes and only brings them out when he wants to play.
Not a bad little B film.  John Agar is his usual B Movie self, but June Kenney is really awful as his love interest.  John Hoyt gives a sweet, warped performance as the lonely doll maker.  Truly one of his best efforts.
MGM has used a decent copy of the film for this DVD.  As is typical with MGM Mignite series, the only extra is the trailer.  Hey, MGM, how about a feature commentary once in a while?",1033171200,4,888,4.307228915662651
149389,5,0792843894,"Attack of the Puppet People is no more than a mediocre B-movie made primarily for the drive-in market of the late 1950s.  The investors didn't even deem it worthy to be filmed in color.  Director Bert I. Gordon and the American International studio instead focussed their lukewarm efforts and severely limited budget on some modest special effects.  John Hoyt portrays the self centered doll maker Mr. Franz who turns the people he likes into miniature size.  In other words, it's best to be on his bad side. Everybody else is essentially ignored and left alone.  Mr. Franz is something of a benign dictator who claims to care for his victims, but refuses to allow them to choose their own destiny.  John Agar, better known as the former real life husband of Shirley Temple is Bob, and June Kenny stars as Sally.  The plot revolves around the attempt of these doll size folks to escape their current irritating predicament.  Please note that I describe their reaction as merely irritating and not existentially horrifying.  Alas, do I really need to add that none of the actors in Puppet People were nominated for any acting awards?  The dialogue is wooden and embarrassing to watch.  It is doubtful if the actors spent even five minutes rehearsing their lines.  Far better acting is normally found in one's local high school theater group.  The movie's theme song utters the ridiculous lyrics ""You're my living doll.""  Admittedly, though, the song is so banal that you might find it hysterically funny.  I still burst out laughing when thinking about it.  This 79 minute long flick probably took no more than two weeks to complete.  Attack of the Puppet People is definitely a strong competitor for the worst movie ever released.
The reader up to this point might assume that I am discouraging them from viewing Attack of the Puppet People.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This movie earns a five star recommendation, but not for its dubious artistic quality.  It inadvertently is the reason why Richard M. Nixon eventually resigned from the presidency.  The lookout for the Watergate burglars was suppose to use his walkie-talkie to warn those inside if the police were entering the building. However, this less than brilliant individual got distracted watching Attack of the Puppet People on television.  Perhaps no other movie has ironically so impacted the history of the United States.  That is reason enough to own a copy---and prominently place it in your own personal film collection.",1025308800,22,2504,4.952038369304557
149390,5,0792843894,"This is a really good movie.  It has great props, and is technically advanced for it's time.  The plot is about a lonely doll maker who cannot stand people leaving him, so he shrinks them to doll size so that they stay with him forever.  These shrunken people include Bob (his salesman) and Sally (his secretary), and four others.  He apparently has shrunken and kept other people including his previous secretary and a mailman, but for some reason he keeps them in suspended animation in tube like containers, only playing with six of his living dolls.  It is never explained why this happened.  This is one of the nicer shrunken people movies, because Hoyt's charcter is not a mad scientist, like ""Dr. Cyclops"" for example.  He uses his puppet people for companionship, although his dolls are none too thrilled about being doll size (except one who says it took her ten minutes to get used to being a such a tiny person).  You almost feel sorry for the guy that he has to go to such extreme lengths for companionship.  Overall, a great 50s sci-fi flick.",992908800,2,1055,4.629032258064516

I have loved this movie ever since I was a kid, and watched it whenever it would play on tv in the early 70s...so I was very pleased to see that a major video company (in this case MGM video) was  finally releasing it for all to see once again!  The story is about a  lonely doll store owner, Mr. Franz (played by John Hoyt), who creates very  realistic mini-versions of people he likes...the same people who have all  also disappeared under mysterious circumstances! A very ambitious little  film from AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL PICTURES with some absolutely flawless  oversized props and some fairly good performances too! John Hoyt as the  desperate doll maker is at his best in this one, and June Kenney (my all  time favorite actress...really!) also does a fine job as his slightly  suspicious and frightened secretary who eventually finds herself becoming  one of the little people! Several other AIP regulars fill out the cast and  make this one heck of a fun film! I highly recommend it! The picture  quality is crystal clear and the video box artwork is fantastic too!

For a kid who loved seeing cheaply made sci-fi movies way back when- it was fun to watch and stirred the imagination. For an old fogie who loves seeing those same movies on dvd- it is great nostalgia. John Hoyt is excellent as the kindly, but demented, doll maker. Special recognition goes to the poor black kitty that got shrunk. One thing bothers me about the dvd cover and movie poster- why is there another dog's ugly mug on them instead of the white dog who was actually in the movie?  Finally, the title should have been something like ""Predicament of the Doll People"" (there was no attack or anything close to it).

I had an appetite for these movies when they were coming out at the local movie theater. Of course Attack of the Puppet People is in my movie collection. While not one of the best films of that time, Bert I. Gordon had a way with story telling and he had the most imaginative monster threats going. If you like stories about shrinking people put in glass tubes, go for it. If you've never experienced watching shrinking people partying down, go for it.

149463,3,0792843894,"There are two (that come to mind offhand) movies that use ""shrinking people"" as the main plot mechanism.  One is the wonderful 1936 ""The Devil-Doll"" with Lionel Barrymore, the other is the very enjoyable 1940 ""Dr. Cyclops"" with Albert Dekker.
  Both of those are a much easier and entertaining watch than this one, ""AotPP"".  However, any movi with John Hoyt is worth watching.  He is one of those actors that has found his niche in moviedom.  Almost always as a a weird eccentric, wealthy tycoon, etc.
  Not a movie that emphasizes the use/abuse of science, relies on a lot of special effects, or great acting.  It still manages to be a fun way of passing time while spending some quality time with micro-humans.",1387238400,,712,4.723577235772358

No thrills, no near deaths, no real reason for this movie even though it had lots of potential it didn't take advantage of anything that would have made me want to see it again.

149512,3,0792843894,"Despite the fact there is really no ""Attack"" and the ""puppets"" are really people, the film is a bit of a rip-off of the more successful Incredible Shrinking Man.

The plot is quick and predictable.  A toymaker whose wife had left him many years ago learns how to shrink people to six inches tall.  He does this so that he won't be alone.  This man is Mr. Franz, played seriously by John Hoyt, a character actor whose been in all kinds of sci-fi, from the crazy rich guy in a wheelchair in ""When Worlds Collide"" to the doctor in the pilot episode of Star Trek.

Franz keeps running out of secretaries (shrinking them and putting them in bottles is bad for business) and so he hires another one; blonde and alone like him.  She falls for Bob (John Agar, whose appeared in many cheesy sci fi flicks of the 50s).

Bob does the right thing:  he proposes marriage in a drive-in which is playing ""The Amazing Colossal Man"" (through an incredible coincidence this film was also directed by Bert I. Gordon, the same director as ""Attack of the Puppet People."").

As the police close in, Franz decides on a murder-suicide but the little people will have none of it.

The plot fades, we never learn the fate of the other shrunken people and Franz stands in a lab, alone -- the worst fate!

Plot holes galore:  How did a toymaker, doll manufacturer and part-time puppeteer find the skills and knowledge to create an advanced scientific device that shrinks organic matter?  Why did he waste this on people when he could have made a mint as a respected scientist?  And what happened to the other shrunken people who escaped into the theater?

You'll have to watch to find out!",1305244800,,1661,4.526845637583893
149513,3,0792843894,"When director Bert Gordon saw the unexpected profits from his AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN and the earlier INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN, he decided that there was room enough in Hollywood for yet another film on a man out of size.  In THE ATTACK OF THE PUPPET PEOPLE, Gordon reshot the much more artistic ISM minus any mystical or sociological subtext.  Here, he cast veteran B actor John Hoyt as Mr. Franz, a demented doll maker who also invented a machine that could shrink human beings down to a mere six inches in height. Gordon did not concern himself with the fact that while it was theoretically possible to shrink matter, the mass would remain constant even while the actual size was reduced.  Thus a six inch human being must weigh as much as before, much like a snowball compressed into a tightly packed core. Hoyt plays Franz in a manner that suggests he is your typical Insane Scientist, one who cannot fathom why his shrunken victims might not appreciate his solicitude for their well-being. As usual, Hoyt's smooth diction elevates his performance above his fellow cast.  John Agar as Bob the salesman is his usual bland self, one who annoys the audience and the object of his affections, the lovely Sally, equally blandly played by June Kenney. Agar comes across as a jerk, but soon he and Miss Kenney are in a drive in theater where he pops the question with her accepting.  There are four other shrunken people. What is astounding about them is that they are played as total airheads. When these four first meet Agar and Kenney, they cannot understand why their new fellow miniatures are not ecstatic about their new station in life. The plot is simple.  All the puppet people try to escape.  There are some scenes of huge mice, cats, and dogs attacking them, which brings to mind some similar scenes from TISM, though in the latter case, were more startling and acceptable.  There is not much to recommend in PUPPET PEOPLE, except that Hoyt manages to come across as one who commits evil but is unaware of doing so. His Mr. Franz is involved in the world of the microcosmic.  For him, the macro world is fraught with danger and pain. When he mentions that his wife left him for another, the audience could actually connect with him on a visceral level.  Even at the end, with his miniature emprire crumbling, he still convinces us that he is more sinned against than sinning.  THE ATTACK OF THE PUPPET PEOPLE emerges as a mildly cautionary tale of the dangers in reducing the pain in one's heart by reducing the external world down to a more manageable size.",1238284800,,2564,4.662971175166297

149515,4,0792843894,"You could generally count on two things when going into a film from producer/director/writer Bert I. Gordon, the first being shoddy visual effects (usually done by Bert himself), and the second being based on the title of the film, you had a good idea what you were going to get, some examples being...The Amazing Colossal Man (1957) had a fifty-foot man going nutzo...Village of the Giants (1965) had a handful of super-sized wacky teenage types giving the establishment what for...and then this film, titled Attack of the Puppet People (1958) featured a group of, you guessed it, pint-sized people struggling to get by in an oversized world.  Produced, co-written, and directed by Gordon the film stars John Agar (The Mole People, The Brain from Planet Arous), June Kenney (Teenage Doll, Earth vs the Spider), and John Hoyt (Blackboard Jungle, X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes).  Also appearing is Michael Mark (The Wasp Woman), Laurie Mitchell (Queen of Outer Space), Jack Kosslyn (The Magic Sword), Ken Miller (I Was a Teenage Werewolf), Scott Peters (The Madmen of Mandoras), and Marlene Willis (Rockabilly Baby).

As the film opens we see a Brownie troop visiting a modest doll manufacturing company called Dolls, Inc. (snazzy name there) owned and operated by seemingly kindly older man named Franz (Hoyt).  As the girls pour over the dolls on display, we see some rather life-like ones in glass canisters in a locked display case on the wall, apparently part of Mr. Franz's special, personal collection...hmmm...enter Sally Reynolds (Kenny), an attractive young woman answering an ad Franz recently submitted to the newspapers who's in need of a new secretary (his last one up and left under mysterious circumstances...yeah right).  Despite being a little weirded out by the old man's behavior (seems he's a little too into his dollies), Sally takes the job, much to the delight of a traveling salesman who works with Franz named Bob Westley (Agar) as he begins putting some serious moves on her (what an operator).  As the pair make plans for the future, Bob up and disappears, and Franz informs Sally he went back home to take care of business and she should try to forget him.  Sally, thinking something hinky at the doll factory, goes to the police with a crackpot theory, but when it doesn't pan out, she decides it's time to split...well, it seems Franz suffers from a severe case of separation anxiety, so much so that when anyone he feels close to tries to leave, he has an interesting method in getting them to stay, specifically a sophisticated shrinky dinky machine, one he uses to put the whammy on Sally.  Turns out Franz has quite the collection of pocket-sized pals, the same ones he keeps on display in glass canisters in the front office.  After mini Sally is reunited with puny Bob, Franz spills the beans about his process, along with his motives for doing what he does, to which afterwards he introduces Sally and Bob to some of his other diminutive `friends'.  As the wee people plot their escape, Franz gets sloppy, and the police start sniffing around.  Franz begins to freak, deciding to throw one last shindig with his itty-bitty buddies before closing up shop permanently...

Despite some obvious flaws, I enjoyed this strictly `B' 1950s sci-fi feature.  The story may seem weak in a number of areas, but I'd argue it was more of a matter of simplicity.  I have little doubt the film was probably made in a very short amount of time, and it seems to have no pretenses about its intent, that being mainly to entertain (and make as much dough as possible).  I liked the fact Hoyt's character wasn't evil, but just lonely, desperately in need of companionship.  That didn't excuse his actions, but in his mind his relationships with those he chose to de-embiggen worked both ways...he got to spend time with them whenever he wanted while they enjoyed the life of Riley, never having to worry about those mundane concerns most all of us deal with on a daily basis like work, paying bills, and so on...his character's science with regards to his miniaturization process  seems somewhat ambiguous (it involved molecular breakdown and resonant frequencies), but I'm sure it probably came across a whole lot more plausible to audiences back in the day when originally released.  I'll admit, I'm somewhat of a closet John Agar fan.  The man may have not been one of the great actors of the time, but you could generally count on him being entertaining.  He's got a few good scenes here, but I've always thought one of his best features to be The Brain from Planet Arous, where he served up the eggs with a big, fat, juicy slab of honey-baked ham.  As far as the rest of the performers they did well enough for the film, and I had no complaints.  As far as the special effects (Gordon's mainstay was the use of rear-projection enlargement technology), they were fairly clever (and cheap) at the time, but don't necessarily hold up well so many years later, so it's probably best not to get too hung up on that aspect, otherwise you might miss the fun.  I did learn a number of things from this film, including the following;

1. When you're six inches tall you're pretty much at the bottom of the food chain.

2. John Agar really seems to hate marionettes.

3. If you're six inches tall you can keep a fifty pound angry canine at bay with a nail.

4. If you're six inches tall clothes taken from dolls whose dimension are nowhere near your own will fit perfectly without alterations.

5. Apparently you can make a living putting on marionette shows.

6. Never leave people you've miniaturized alone for any amount of time otherwise they're sure to plot against you.

7. If you've perfected a process to miniaturize people just so you can keep them around as friends, it's probably not the best idea to keep them on display where anyone can see them even if they are in a state of suspended animation.

8. Scientists don't often realize the vast, commercial, financial, and humanitarian possibilities of their inventions, no matter how obvious they may seem (I'd guess a machine that could shrink and enlarge both inanimate and animate objects could not only do a lot of good but make someone a whole lot of dough).

9. Seems to me the ability to put people into states of suspended animation by use of a pill you've invented might be worth something, but then what the hell do I know?

10. A rear-projection enlarged street rat chasing a pair of six inch people is more funny that frightening, at least by today's standards.

All in all not my favorite Bert I. Gordon feature (I'd have to go with either The Cyclops or The Amazing Colossal Man), but it's still a good deal of fun of the economy B movie kind.

The picture, presented in fullscreen (1.33:1), looks very clean on this DVD, and exhibits only a couple of minor flaws.  As far as the Dolby Digital mono audio, available in English, Spanish, and French, it came through very well, with no complaints.  The only extras included are an original theatrical trailer along with Spanish and French subtitles.

By the way, I'd appreciate a DVD release of Gordon's The Food of the Gods (1976)...as I write this it's still not available on the DVD format, and that just doesn't seem right.",1152230400,16,7276,4.74900714853058
149516,4,0792843894,"Bert I. Gordon, the producer known for alternately making people and animals really big or small, was the brains behind this film, which is one of the best of the genre. It is a Black and White production from 1958 featuring John Hoyt as the mad doll maker, John Agar in his typical hero role, and a fairly bland performance by June Kenney as the love interest.
The plot is fairly typical, Hoyt kidnaps people and shrinks them to doll size so he will never be lonely; after authorities get onto his trail he loses control of his life and the dolls. The movie is actually very well done, and the split screen shots are pretty decent, particularly of the cats and dogs. I was initially leaning toward a five star appraisal of the film, but the ending is somewhat abrupt and anticlimactic, so I give the film four stars for being an entertaining B-Movie genre period piece, and also for the performances of the two male leads. John Hoyt is genuinely creepy in his role of Mr. Franz the doll maker, and John Agar was born to play the hero in period pieces like this and the later ""Zontar, The Thing From Venus"", a film that definitely needs to be released on DVD soon.
My favorite scene in the film is when Agar and Kenney go to the drive in to see ""War of the Colossal Beast"", another Bert I. Gordon 'human of improbable size' film with an astronaut who grows to enormous proportions. Don't miss it; it's a B-Movie classic!",1078185600,7,1420,4.423664122137405
149517,4,0792843894,"This was a drive-in movie classic from the late 50s.  John Hoyt plays the somewhat-benevolent mad scientist with pathos as he shrinks people he likes, stores them in a display case of dolls, and brings them out at night for entertainment.

If you enjoy cheesy B-movies, or if you have fond memories of this or other old b&w 'scary' movies, you will enjoy this nice print of Bert Gordon's (The Amazing Colossal Man) classic, with little people dialing a (rotary!) phone, being chased by a dog, and acting out a scene in a puppet theatre.

DVD extras are sparse: a trailer, and subtitles in French or Spanish -- hey, it's educational!!",1055980800,2,633,4.684684684684685
7792300,3,0792843894,"This review is for the Blu-ray edition of 'Attack of the Puppet People' release by Shout! Factory in 2017.

If you have never seen this movie, you should be aware that the title is misleading in more ways than one. There is no 'attack' of the puppet people. It is an escape. Also, the people aren't supposed to be puppets. They are dolls. Though they do briefly act in a puppet show so you can call them that.

BLU-RAY & EXTRA'S: As usual with these releases by Shout! Factory of old science fiction movies, the picture is excellent. It is as good as it should be and you won't see many imperfections if any at all. The pictures is sharp and clear and is in wide screen format (1.85:1). The movie is 79 minutes long. In addition you get a commentary track by film historian Tom Weaver. You also get a Trailer and subtitles.

PLOT/SUMMARY: Mr. Franz is a doll maker who has his office and production facility in a office building. On his wall is a locked case of very life like looking dolls. Sally Reynolds answers a an ad for a secretarial position after the previous secretary suddenly disappears. Bob Westley (played by science fiction icon John Agar) is a traveling salesman and meets Sally. They become friends. Sally confides in him and tells him about some odd things that have happened while on the job. Shortly, John asks Sally to marry him and asks her to quit her job. Mr. Franz does not take this very well. Bob suddenly takes off on Sally without saying anything....or did he? Sally notices a new doll that looks exactly like Bob. She goes to the police and tells them that she thinks Mr. Franz has turned Bob into a doll. Obviously they don't believe her but investigate anyway. I guess the detective must have been trying to get some you know what. After all, Sally is a beautiful girl. Mr. Franz then traps Sally and sure enough he shrinks her down to doll size. She is then introduced to all the other dolls that are alive. Mr. Franz also has developed suspended animation so he can put them to 'sleep'. Yes I know.....don't say a thing. I'll address this in my comments below. Mr. Franz has parties with these dolls (people) because he is lonely after his wife died. The police show up and question Mr. Franz. They believe his story and do nothing. Mr. Franz decides that it is only a matter of time before he gets caught and decides that he is going to commit suicide and destroy his 'dolls' at the same time. Fortunately, Emil, a puppeteer, comes to the office to have Mr. Franz repair one of his marionettes. He also convinces Mr. Franz to come down to his theater. Franz takes the dolls with him and Bob and Sally escape. They need to somehow get back to the office and enlarge themselves without getting killed in the streets.

PRODUCTION/COMMENTS: This movie was made by Bert I. Gordon, otherwise known as Mr. Big. It was shot in 1958 and was trying to capitalize on the success of 'The Incredible Shrinking Man' which was released the year before. It was released by AIP.

In this movie 'Mr. Big' sort of did things in reverse. So for this movie we should probably call him 'Mr. Small.' He is famous for his sci-fi movies in which he enlarges insects, animals and humans. Some examples are 'The Amazing Colossal Man,' 'Beginning of the End,' 'Food of the Gods,' and 'Empire of the Ants.'

As mentioned above, there is no 'attack' of the puppet people. A better title, but less sensational, would be 'Escape of the Doll People.' From doing some investigating I learned that the working title was ""The Fantastic Puppet People.""

The whole idea behind a doll maker inventing a shrinking ray (along with an enlarging ray too!) is preposterous. The movie doesn't even bother giving a reasonable explanation (they just give you a bunch of nonsense which I won't bother repeating). The entire reason given is that Mr. Franz is lonely. I think I'll invent a machine that spits out a 21 year old perfect 10' blonde whenever I'm lonely. OK all kidding aside. If you are going to enjoy this movie you are going to have to suspend disbelief....like completely shutting your brain off for the few moments that Mr. Franz gives his explanation.
While we are at it, Mr. Franz invented suspended animation. No explanation given. He just pops the little people into their tubes and bingo...they go into suspended animation. Supposedly there is a gas in the tube that puts them into suspension but I don't know the gas stays in the tube once it's opened. That sort of device could be pretty useful for your relatives.

Almost unbelievably, Mr. Franz, who is supposed to be hiding any evidence of his crimes, leaves out the mailman's mailbag! This after he abducted him.

Because there is no real explanation given as to the scientific inventions of Mr. Franz (at least no plausible one), this movie is more fantasy than science fiction. However, I still consider it barely science fiction too.

Also unbelievably, Sally jumps to the incredible conclusion that Mr. Franz is shrinking people. I know these things happen because you only have so much time in a short movie to develop the plot but once again this is just fantasy.

One of the dolls actually says that she likes being shrunken into a doll. Sure...who wouldn't want to be abducted, stuffed in a tube, given sleeping gas and only being allowed out to be used as a doll to play house with a giant?

When Bob and Sally are at the drive-in movie, they are watching Bert I. Gordon's, ""The Amazing Colossal"" man. The scene they are watching throws a hint at them. The Colossal Man says ""I'm not growing, you are shrinking.""

We never really find out what happened to the remaining 'dolls.' I suppose we can assume that Sally and Bob go back and rescue them and bring them back to the office to be enlarged.

RECOMMENDATIONS: I'm giving this release 3 stars. You get a real nice picture, the best available for this movie. You also get a commentary track. But the movie is not that good. It doesn't really deserve a release by itself. It should have been released as part of a double feature as Gordon's 'Empire of the Ants' was.

If you are a fan of 50's science fiction then you will probably want this for your collection.",1515628800,,6185,4.564472497745717

He then forces his human re-inventions to put on parties and sing to him and keep him company since he seems to have the equivalent of 1958's abandonment issues! Mr. Franz owns a doll making factory and well he has taken his craft a step further. Please keep in mind that this is from 1958 and go from there. This is nonetheless a very fun and entertaining entry into the world of scifi. If I had one complaint to make it is the drubbing of the horrible music all through but as I said ......1958!

So, let me be the first - first a note to the other people writing what they think are actual reviews - no one cares what you think of the movie, especially the one-star fools.  So other than telling you this is one of Bert I. Gordon's most appealing films, let me review the product that you're purchasing, which is a - wait for it - BLU-RAY.  First of all, this is cause for rejoicing in that it is finally in its proper theatrical ratio of 1.85.  It's also a new scan and it looks terrific.  Yes, one has to say it loudly since no one understands what film is, the opticals in the film are many and those are OPTICALS - generations away from the original footage - they look like they're supposed to look - softer than the rest of the film.  I highly recommend this Blu-ray - and this is the film that introduced Mr. Gordon's beautiful daughter Susan to the world and that is reason enough to own it - that and the lovely performance by John Hoyt.",1513209600,7,1046,4.284263959390863

7792307,4,0792843894,"Released in 1958 and shot in B&W, Attack of the Puppet People chronicles the story of a lonely doll maker (John Hoyt) who shrinks people to 1/6 their size to presumably play god. June Kenney plays his winsome secretary, John Agar a man interested in romancing her and Jack Kosslyn a police officer who investigates the curious goings-on.

The title is inaccurate and shouldve been called Attack of the Doll Maker, but I guess that wouldnt have been attractive. In any case, this is a well done late 50s sci-fi/horror flick. I appreciate that the material is taken seriously and you cant help but sympathize with the doll maker. But this doesnt negate the perverseness of what hes doing. His actions are akin to Big Government advocates who want to restrict more & more freedoms and provide everything for citizens. Some fall under their spell while others do everything in their power to escape.

Just like the film ""Kong Island"" without a Kong, or ""She Gods of Shark reef"", the title of the film is a misnomer as no one is attacked by any puppet people.

People start disappearing right off the bat. We already guessed the reason.

Mr. Franz (John Hoyt) has a new secretary after being sure she had no relatives or close friends. This already sounds sinister. Soon the secretary introduced to the top salesman Bob (John Agar of ""The Brain from Planet Arous"" fame). What about bob? Soon they plan to marry and Bob also disappears.

For some strange reason the secretary Sally (Joyce Meadows) suspects poor Mr. Franz just because he cannot stand to be left behind. We too suspect Franz, but that is crazy. Luckily no one else is crazy or we would not have this well made for the era black and white movie.",1457222400,4,903,4.521472392638037
