I listened to the DVD in stereo, but apparently there is the possibility to listen to it in 5:1 DTS or 5:1 dolby

What do I think of it?
I was quite surprised with the quality of the performance, and overall sound quality and filming.
My preferred songs on this DVD are ""Wintertime"", and ""Chance For A Lifetime"".

The other songs are very good too, for most of them. The female singer is very good, and brings some freshness in the middle of these dinausaurs of prog rock. (in 2003 we were ""30 years after"" [their debuts]). There is a very good cohesion and it's really a shame that this band wasn't more well known, because they really carry something original, at the frontier between classical pop and progressive rock. Full of energy, too, always with a surprise !

Running time is not very long, but I prefer quality over quantity.

(For the CD choice, my favourites are those that were originally released on vinyl in the years 73 74 approx.)",1299024000,6,1695,4.657718120805369
8171280,5,B000JRYOOC,What I don't understand is why no one has reviewed this DVD yet!  I just ordered it and cannot wait for its arrival.  Once i do get it I will watch it and give it the review it deserves. I gave it r stars because I know I will not be disappointed with it.  I've been a Kayak fan since the 70's.  And I've loved their music for the longer time since then.  I only recently acquired those old records on CD and never get tired of listening i them.  Now I will be actually seeing them on the DVD.  So you can probably imagine my anxiousness for its arrival.  More to follow.,1243987200,4,571,3.9911504424778763
