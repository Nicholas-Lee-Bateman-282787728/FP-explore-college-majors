8718926,3,B00YSBFF4S,"I got to season 5 and unwrapped the dvds, the cover was wrinkled, unlike the other ones. I proceeded to watch the disc 1 and a lot of parts are scratched. I am able to watch some parts, but it has spots where it pauses. Thank you.....paula myomick",1493769600,,247,4.166666666666667
8718927,5,B00YSBFF4S,"First of all note, that in each series year, the title of the episode has as many words as the series Year. Year one- title is one word, up to year four, then, Year five- title is three words, reversing the order. It gives us a signal.

When all is said and done the one through the sixth season of The Good Wife was shocking. It brings with it the most amazing music. We Know the amazing cast, Julianne Margolis is the Good Wife, Chris Noth is the Bad Husband, and this thing about the marriage, does it break up, what does the Good Wife do, how does the family react, and what about that mother-in-law?

We know the firm where Alicia is now an attorney, Lockhart and Gardner. Will Gardner played by Josh Child's is an old lover of Alicia, Diane Lockhart, played by Christine Baranski is the other formidable partner. Archie Panjabi plays the sexy, wonderful Kalinda. Alan Cumming plays Eli Gold, the cunning chief of staff for Peter. How the world does roll.

Kalinda has a prime part in this series. She lets us know she is not gay, but she is flexible. An old flame, husband finds her, and they are not on good terms except in bed, and now in the courtroom. Expect fireworks. Peter faces a formidable political opponent as he rubs for Governor, and he faces a big surprise, The guest stars are ever more brighter and funnier. But, now the time has come to say goodbye to Kalinda.  Alicia may become State's Attorney.....

When the Good Wife started there had been a rash of good wives of politicians whose husbands had done them wrong. What a wonderful opportunity for a series. However. As the series moves along, we find Alicia Florrick as the Good Wife. Will she forgive her husband, Peter, as he Enters jail for corruption charges? As the States Attorney for Cook County will this end his career? Will Cary ever get out of jail?

And, as the series follows Alicia, what happens to the Good Wife after the scandal wears down? How does the family move on, we discover all of this in season one. A remarkable cast and an excellent first season. Kudos reign for all.
