3171744,5,B0017HEY98,"Goodall does a terrific job exquisitely demonstrating the progression of music through the ages.  It is a rather in depth look at different events that changed the evolution of music of through the centuries.  It's been a few years since I watched this series.  I bought it when it was only available in the UK.  It was well worth the $45.

Goodall is a well rounded musician/educator.  Indulge yourself!",1313884800,,404,4.782608695652174
3171745,4,B0017HEY98,"Saw a few of these episodes a few years ago on Ovation TV and loved them. They air once in a blue moon but if your timing is off you might have to wait a while.

I ordered the DVD set to use in my high school choir classes, both as ways to introduce them to units of Music History and also as ""emergency lesson plans"" that a Sub could easily pull out at a moment's notice. For a music teacher worried about beginning groups' ability to hold sectionals in his/her absence or wary of putting their accompanist in charge of the choir, these are a perfect way to meet music history standards without losing a ton of rehearsal time.

The DVD menus are cleanly designed, easy to navigate, and the discs are clearly labeled. It would do fine in the hands of any substitute teacher or capable student.

Students might be overwhelmed at the sheer amount of information contained in some of these episodes, but playing them in order would be really beneficial; Notation should come before the Piano episode, etc. My students in particular loved the Piano episode because a lot didn't understand how the keys worked or the mechanics involved in actually playing the instrument. Fascinating.

For bonus points, Howard Goodall also released another series called ""Great Dates"" which is similar in scope to these ""Big Bangs"" but takes a bit different angle. The ""Great Dates"" episodes focus on a particular year or moment in time and cover many musical fields/trends/developments rather than the ""Big Bangs"" linear evolution of a single concept/genre/instrument.",1303603200,,1548,4.830188679245283

3171747,3,B0017HEY98,"Howard Goodall has presented important stages in the evolution of classical music in a very lively, entertaining manner.  Particularly fascinating was the evolution of the 12 tone system based on the square root of two.  I had never pondered why the scale of C followed by D E F G then A B C worked mathematically in addition to tonally.

If he went this far, then he should also explain in further detail  how one can play an A major scale on the piano or a wind instrument or better still, F # minor.  He presents the seminal piano work by Bach in which all the keys are played.  But I would like to see and hear how the individual key signatures work.  More importantly, I would have wished for more specific examples of why composers select the keys to convey happy or sad, tragic feelings.  What is the significance of Mahler sketching his last symphony, the 10th in F# minor?  Mahler seems to be handing music over to Berg and Schoenberg by exploring in atonality in bits and pieces.

Also, there are certain pieces that are forward looking in that they inspire a student or other composers in terms of tonality, orchestration.  I refer to Haydn's  ""The Creation"" which utilized a large orchestra or Wagner's ""Tristan und Isolde"" which also goes on the fringe of atonality as well.  These should have been discussed more throughly.",1250121600,2,1337,4.614406779661017

3171749,5,B0017HEY98,A great review of seminal events/movements in music history.  Goodall does a great job of mixing historical and biographical information with charm and wit--not to mention great music.  It's too bad there's only five episodes!  Very entertaining!,1218844800,3,246,5.594594594594595
3171750,5,B0017HEY98,"Thanks for finally making this available on DVD.  I recorded all of the episodes from Ovation TV earlier this year but the quality was poor, so I'll pick this up.  This is a very witty and well researched series.  The explanation of equal temperament is the best I've ever heard -- and I have a masters in music.  I would've grasped the concept much quicker had I seen this presentation.",1212624000,10,387,4.485714285714286
3171751,5,B0017HEY98,"If you have any interest in music that goes beyond
a childs level this is an essential purchase.
Excellent production values, witty, amusing and

Would make a superb gift to anyone with even a
cursory interest in 'art' music - especially as an
introduction - buy it for a friend, relative or
anyone you care for and it just might turn into a
musical epiphany for them, which is what the intent
of the entire series is about.
You will not be dissapointed with this dvd or
anything else that Howard Goodall is in, everything

8265888,5,B0017HEY98,I originally recorded this series on VHS from my TV when it was on public television.  Every topic is a fascinating aspect of music history.  He is entertaining and great at explaining concepts.  The episodes are very well written and produced.  I was very excited to see it was available as a DVD series because I wanted to use the first episode about the invention of musical notation in connection with a presentation I gave on Gregorian chant.  It was the perfect introduction of the theory part of the presentation that allowed me to get into having people read and sing chant.  The rest of the topics are also extremely interesting for anyone interested in music history.,1428105600,,677,4.743589743589744
