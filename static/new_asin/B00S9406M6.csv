6965150,4,B00S9406M6,"Jersey Justice.... I'm in! New Jersey revenge movie has all the right elements for a low budget comic thriller. The budget has it's problems but I was really enjoying the movie. The lead actress, Blanche Baker was the sister in ""Sixteen Candles"" and she was really funny in that movie. Her character of a Christian wife and mother going crazy after the death of her husband and adult son is compelling enough. Going to hunt down an outlaw biker gang in Jersey is funny, in a snarky way. The cast is very good, with Ed McCool as a crusty drunk with a bunch of guns in his trunk, and a detective in Philly named Vic who gets big laughs busting balls with an FBI guy. Bo Svenson from the Walking Tall movies has a good part as a slime ball contractor who mom blames for the death of her executive son. The script has some sly references to past genre movies like Billy Jack and Dirty Harry, and the setting in Philadelphia and Jersey is original for gritty crime movies. All in all it's a good small indie.",1422835200,2,1003,4.340425531914893

You have to pay attention to every line in the movie as the writers have creatively written the film to keep you guessing.  This has the potential to be a great cult film and you will find something new everytime you watch it  My college kids have shared the movie with their friends and they love it.  Enjoy the film, this is a great purchase!",1433289600,,520,4.255102040816326

8697799,4,B00S9406M6,"Good movie!! Always liked movies where revenge is involved. Very different having the woman going postal for a change. Just goes to show how anybody can be pushed over the edge. Bo Svenson, haven't seen him in awhile, still looks about the same. Good storyline overall. You wont' be disappointed if you give it a look.",1424822400,2,318,4.696428571428571

8697801,5,B00S9406M6,"If you like Grindhouse, this is for you! If you like funny, this is for you! If you just need something to watch for 90 minutes and then talk your friends' ear off about it afterward, this is for you. So many actors you recognize from something else, action that has you wondering what's next, and classic lines that you're going to be quoting throughout the week. Glad this is in my collection now.",1424044800,2,399,4.405405405405405
8697802,5,B00S9406M6,"I was caught of guard by this revenge thriller, because it was so much more.  Drama, suspense, great characters, but above all hilarious!  So much great dialogue between a cast with great chemistry, that I found myself quoting it immediately after I heard it.  The cast was awesome!  One familiar face after another combined with a plot that had no lulls, kept me enthralled from start to finish leaving me wishing there was a Jersey Justice 2, where Polly took up a career as an unassuming gun-for-hire.",1423958400,2,504,4.758620689655173

8697804,5,B00S9406M6,"103 Minutes of pure entertainment! This movie has everything -- suspense, drama, revenge, action, comedy, plot, characters, violence, babes, bikers, bad-asses and enough twists and turns to keep you guessing where the story's going to take you next throughout the film, start to finish. This a nice, first-time effort from writer / director John Hunt that after watching makes you asks what's coming next from the production team of John and his wife Kathi. The budget may be low on this indie-revenge flick but the plot and story lines are big.

There are some great performances turned in by seasoned and recognizable Hollywood talent such as Blanche Baker (lead), Bo Svenson and Brian Anthony Wilson to name a few. However the real scene-stealing performances are turned in by Jerry Lyden, Chris Mann and Ed McCool. You'll need to watch to see what I'm talking about.

I'd also like to recognize the editing and pacing of the film achieved by first-time feature editor, Christopher Tully. Chris's editing in combination with John's direction keeps the film moving at a pace that engages and entertains the audience throughout.

As an added bonus with this DVD, John includes a Director's Commentary with him and his Cinematographer, Abe Holtz. The commentary is very entertaining and makes the movie worth watching a second time so that you can learn all about the making of the movie as well as all the behind-the-scenes production stories and background on the film from John and Abe.

I enthusiastically and highly recommend this movie!!",1423094400,2,1543,5.062992125984252
