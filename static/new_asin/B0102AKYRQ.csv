8721267,4,B0102AKYRQ,"An adult card game anime. That's not to say there's fanservice or anything like that. It's a drama, centered in pain and some more adult themes. It's a horror, without gore or any of those traditional trappings. This anime feels very different, focusing on the dark side of not only losing, but winning. It's uncomfortable. It was a little hard to watch, but I kept at it because it is definitely unpredictable. Where would it go? I'm glad I kept at it. The game reality, and the reality outside of it, truth and wishes, it's a good anime. Where other card anime focuses on cards, this anime focuses on the story, well paced - and the twist is crazy. It puts the whole thing in a different light, making me rethink the motivations and dialogs of the previous episodes. Definitely the mark of a good anime. And the ending? What's going on? Another twist, a cliffhanger that only the second season will answer.",1483833600,,908,4.576687116564417

8721275,4,B0102AKYRQ,"Just got finished, and I'll say it's an enjoyable show if you're looking for something different regarding card game based animes. I did however have a few problems with it. But first, the positives.

1. The animation is gorgeous. It's all very fluid, especially during the battle sequences.
2. The atmosphere is excellent, and this is partially due to the music and style of the show. At times it's very creepy, and the haunting tracks only enhance this.
3. The twists are good. I won't spoil them, but I'll just say that you'll probably feel sorry for the Selectors by the end.
4. While the protagonists aren't that unique, they are at least likable.
5. The villains of the show are also pretty sadistic, especially the first one.
And now for the negatives.
1. I wish they would have explained how the game worked. All you really see them doing is moving cards back and forth to power up their avatars. I know the show was created for the characters, but when the card game is also a big focus, it's best to explain it.
2. Yuzuki, how do I put this? For over half the show she was annoying. To explain why though, I have to spoil what her wish is. She wants her and her brother to be together forever, as in a couple. Now, besides me tolerance with the overabundance of incest showing coming out nowadays, I wouldn't have had too much trouble with this. However, she constantly brings it up, and she goes from being herself, to being a big creep. Not to mention they constantly knock you over the head with it over and over. I almost hit the breaking point when she decided to break up with her friends to chase after her wish. It was really annoying.
3. It ends on a cliffhanger. Nothing needs to be said here. If you want to find out what happens afterwards, you'll have to wait for Selector Spread WIXOSS.

Overall though, it was a fun series to watch regardless of its flaws. If you liked Madoka Magica, you'll probably like this as well.",1445299200,10,1944,4.442577030812325
