8031758,5,B0002TSZYC,This video was part of my cardiac rehab and it was the best information about getting heart healthy I have every seen or read. I wish everyone had this in their library and made it a priority to view and review at least once a year. It could save a life and help keep a heart patient from having another heart attach or surgery.,1395014400,2,328,4.140625

I can't recommend this program highly enough- if you have a heart condition, or have a family history of such, you owe it to yourself and your loved ones to watch this program.

A MD and a PHD discuss 5 steps for behavioral change to a healthy heart....discussing stress, exercise, anger, diet, and other factors that affect the heart.

The program was easy to understand and is not filled with medical jargon that could be confusing.

a must-see for better living.",1248652800,2,557,4.770833333333333
