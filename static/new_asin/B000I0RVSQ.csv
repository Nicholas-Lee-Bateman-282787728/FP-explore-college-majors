8523843,4,B000I0RVSQ,"This movie is a light Muslim story with good songs and a very good star cast. Sunil Dutt gives a gr8 performance in the role of a simple Muslim poet who falls in love with the voice of a girl. Meena Kumari gives an awesome performance in the role of a girl who loses her voice just when she is a about to hear a good news. Rahman's role however does not suit him since his image which he has had because of his roles in Pyaasa and Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam,of a serious man,has been changed to a funny and a coward lover. Moreover the reason it does not get 10 is the flaw in its turning point. The turning point is a light one and so seems kinda funny. Overall the movie is very good and a light one.",1301961600,3,697,3.950354609929078
