8519100,1,B007KIA4EW,"made it through about half of this 3D dud i put it under my dvd shelves hopefully never to be seen again. what a complete
disappointment. thought it might show vegas in all it's glory... alas, all you see is the outside of hotel casinos and empty
streets. evidently this dud was shot at 4:37 in the morning... no people or traffic to speak of. no show themes. no nothin'.
don't waste your money... yuk!",1379721600,,402,4.373333333333333
8519101,5,B007KIA4EW,The 3d is very good and the photography very nice.  The narrator left a bit to be desired but other than that all ok!!,1356566400,,118,3.9166666666666665
8519102,1,B007KIA4EW,"Half the blu Ray is footage of Las Vegas hotels and recognizable spots, the other half is the narrator which is so dreadful. Looks like you could see better video on youtube. The recording is so bad, I had to lower the volume to zero. For one thing, the blu ray was mailed out late to get this piece of trash. This is my first review on any kind of video.  its to bad, no review was available when it first came out. Also the music back ground is all jungle music. $15.00 wasted.",1346025600,8,479,4.095744680851064
8519103,1,B007KIA4EW,"Wow. What a disaster this thing is. Worst DVD I have ever seen in my life. The best thing about it is the menu waiting for your choice of Play, Chapter, etc

I don't remember what my expectations were going in, but none of them were met. The entire DVD is a series of mediocre shots of the outsides of Las Vegas casinos, buildings, and street signs. If you walked around with a camcorder, stayed on the streets and sidewalks, and pointed the camera more or less randomly at whatever you came upon, you would have the bulk of this footage. They never even stepped inside a casino, the whole DVD is the outside of buildings. In a couple of cases, leaves hanging from a nearby tree obscured the view of the hotel sign, so you didn't even know what you were looking at.

But the worst part is the narration. Some random guy who sounds like he's trapped in a tunnel of some kind reads from a teleprompter about the history and other Las Vegas tidbits. For some reason the director-- if there was one-- thought we should be treated to frequent shots of this unknown fellow. To break up the monotony, sometimes we are treated to shots of him from the side! Theres no reason to have to watch this guy in the first place. Not only is he no one in particular, but he does a poor job of reading/narrating. I could tolerate the strange mispronouncements. But the way he read was just too weird and annoying. He tried so hard to keep it from being done in a monotone that his intonations and emphasis are completely unnatural and difficult to listen to once you become aware of it.

I'm already tired of talking about it. There is no reason for anyone to ever buy this DVD, with the possible exception of family members of the producers or the random black guy they pulled off the street to narrate. Its awful, just awful.",1345075200,8,1809,4.377976190476191
8519104,1,B007KIA4EW,"I am a fan of everything Las Vegas, so I was really excited about getting this dvd.  I was disappointed when I  put it in the blu ray player and saw what a disaster it was.

While the dvd does offer some decent footage of Las Vegas hotels and recognizable spots, the English audio narration is beyond dreadful.  Besides sounding like it was recorded at the bottom of a deep, dark well, the ""actor"" narrating the video was filmed in what appears to be cheaply shot home video format.  In sharp contrast, the footage of Vegas itself is clear and professional looking.

The English language narration is truly dreadful beyond belief - the actor mispronounces every other word (""Sigmon & Roy"" instead of ""Sigfried and Roy"", and he could not even pronounce the word ""facade"" correctly).  This fiasco was produced in Germany but the worst thing about the choice of English narrator is that he is obviously an American (they could not find anyone else in the entire county of Germany who knew how to speak proper, enunciated English?) - how could they hire someone who is completely inarticulate and unable to correctly pronounce important words?  It was laughably bad.  He looked as if he was reading off a teleprompter the entire time and inserted annoying little chuckles in inappropriate places in the script (presumably in a failed attempt to add personality to the reading.)

Some of the flat, bad delivery could be forgiveable if the narration was not plain BORING.  It was like watching paint dry.  And there were many points where the volume on the narration went super low as the scene changed and what the actor was saying became jumbled and nearly inaudible.  As I said in the title, a mess.

The only way I could ever recommend this to anyone with a clear conscience is ONLY if you are a super die-hard fan of Las Vegas and just want to see 40 minutes of familiar footage as a fix between trips (yes this dvd is only 40 minutes long, not 80 like the description says here on Amazon).  But do yourself a huge favor and turn the sound off completely and just play your own seelction of favorite Vegas-style songs as you watch the footage.  Anything is better than the English ""audio"" that they have provided on this sad amateurishly produced product.",1342742400,8,2254,4.654040404040404
8519105,4,B007KIA4EW,"I bought this video to help plan my vacation to Las Vegas. I was looking mostly for information about hotels and attractions along the strip. This video provided a good, but brief, introduction to the features of all the major hotels along the strip. I was pleased that they also covered a number of attractions outside the strip. Unfortunately, I felt they spent too much time on some very minor attractions, such as the Harley Davidson Cafe. I would have preferred that more of that time be spent on giving more information on the strip hotels and on the Fremont Street Experience.",998956800,,583,4.7254901960784315
8519106,5,B007KIA4EW,"I live in Las Vegas.  I bought the video to send to my Mom who is coming out to visit shortly.  I wanted to give her an idea of things she could do  when she gets here. Before I sent it to her, I decided to watch it.  It was  quite amazing! This video is a wirlwind tour of all the newest and biggest  hotels on the strip. What I really liked about it was that it highlighted  something unique about each hotel. For example, it showed the Knights of  the Roundtable at Excalibur and the StarTrek experience at the Hilton.  It  also showed all the surrounding areas including Hoover Dam, The Grand  Canyon and even a blimp flight over the strip including incredible aerial  shots of the Bellagio fountains.  There's even a gunfight from the ghost  town of Oatman, AZ. on the video. The quality was very good and as far as I  could tell it was right up to date.",966211200,8,859,4.216049382716049
