Yes, it is slow. Yes, you have to pay  attention to it.  The charm is in the details of the expressions and tones  of voices.  Still - I had 10 convicted male felons watch it without moving  from their seats until the the very end last Tuesday - and it generated a  very lively discussion on propriety, the British Navy and how women's lives  have changed.  That isn't something too many movies do!",931996800,4,576,4.108108108108108

742676,4,6303965415,"I watched this movie before I read Jane Austen's ""Persuasion"".  When I first watched it, it seemed extremely slow -- nothing was happening!  Towards the ending things got better, but I wasn't that impressed.
Then  I bought the book and read it.  From a strict  movie entertainment level  from the first viewing, I would give this film 3 stars.  However, from its  capturing of the essense of the book, it deserves 5 stars.  Upon first  watching it, I was confused by Amanda Root, who isn't that attractive but  gets the handsome Captain Wentworth at the end.  However, I see that this  reflects the book, where Anne has lost her bloom and is thus not as  beautiful as she once was, but the strength of character and true love  between the two wins out.
The other reviewers here were right -- this  movie gets better and better upon watching it multiple times.  It's a very  quiet movie in a way, but full of gentle nuances that are really quite  powerful once you get into that mindset.",930528000,2,986,4.531428571428571
742677,5,6303965415,"Apparently the viewer from Baltimore is not the nuanced fan of Jane Austen she (or he) would like to think she is. Perhaps ""fans"" such as this would prefer, say, Leonardo de Caprio and Cameron Diaz in the lead roles. I do not, however, believe this is what Austen would have wanted. ""Persuasion"" was Austen's last novel, and it is her most deeply felt and serious as well. It is often thought to be a reflection of the middle-aged and unmarried Austen's own experience of missed love, but in her case it never had a happy ending. There is a more sombre and bitter-sweet tone to this novel than to her others, and only the coarsest reading of it could miss that atmosphere. The film perfectly captures the feelings of an earnest woman who is beautiful in her own right, and attractive due to her intelligence and gentleness of spirit. She is clearly made of higher stuff than most of those who surround her, yet the brilliant actors and direction never resort to obvious or heavy-handed caracatures of types. Captain Wentworth is not pretty and is, thankfully and quite rightly, not attractive in the glossy, big-toothed Hollywood sort of way. He is, instead, handsome in his dashing and forceful character. Both Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are perfectly cast in this wonderful and faithful adaptation of Jane Austen's masterpiece.",923702400,5,1331,4.816593886462882

742996,5,6303965415,"The most authentic Austen adaptation of them all  from dialogue, to direction, cinematography, to acting talenteven the costumes and the female, makeup-free faces  this made-for-television, BBC/PBS partnership rocked the film world by its surprising success when released as a theatrical movie (which just goes to show that excellence is far more dependent on the talent of a films creators, than the money spent on its production).....And did I mention Ciaran Hinds?...

  The players in Persuasion are all top-flightmany Old Vic alumni and OBE awardees (which translates into Britains best), and simply transition beautifully into their roles :  Corin Redgrave, as Annes  superficial and supercilious father, Susan Fleetwood, as the persuasive (and emotionally domineering) Lady Russell, and Sophie Thompson, as Annes consistently dissatisfied and hypochondriac sister....and, Ciaran Hinds? Not only one of Britains finest actors, but one who inhabits his role as both sea Captain during the Napoleanic Wars and proud, resentfulyet, long-pining suitor to Annewith absolute believability....

  The ONLY negative I would offer regarding this most excellent adaptation is the casting of Amanda Root as Anne Elliott....Although Root is undeniably an accomplished actressone who can play both Shakespearean dramas or modern comedies with flairI believe that both her physical presence and interpretation of Anne were lacking....Physically, Austen describes Anne as being tall, and although she has lost her bloom (due to her failed love affair with Wentworth), she nonetheless has delicate features, with deep-set, dark eyes, and a full smile...Instead, we are presented with Roots near-dwarfish height, and a bushy-browed, slightly bug-eyed countenanceoverseeing a pair of missing lips. Even so, I could overlook features so contrary to the authors description, were it not for Roots permanently martyred look (buzz killer would be an understatement) : unsmiling (when in smiling company), and with a permanently pained lookincluding a permanently gaping mouth, and a deeply furrowed brow (the thought of spending EIGHT YEARS with such a personality would have me grasping for a syringe of Botox with one hand, while the other was itching for a hard slap to snap her out of it)....Wearing ones heart on ones sleeve in such a manner was not only considered self-pitying in Austens time, but a sign of poor character/breeding none of which were attributes of Anne Elliott (although Austen DID describe Anne as being somewhat melancholy, she also emphasized the fact that Anne was adept at hiding her personal anguish from others)....

  Such quibbles notwithstanding, Persuasion is a film made for repeated viewings each one, opening another window into the human spirit and charactereach one, another voyage of discovery into the human heart....",1514505600,3,2843,5.599067599067599

743321,4,6303965415,"A very good adaptation and enjoyable to watch but I have two minor quibbles and a fairly large one.

First, the minor quibbles: I loved Ciaran Hinds as Frederick Wentworth but would prefer to have seen someone cast opposite to him who was physically a better match, the height difference was pronounced enough to be distracting. And the two voiceovers during the reading of his letter made it difficult to hear the beautiful words he'd written. His voice alone would have made this scene perfect.

The major quibble has to do with Mrs. Smith's revelations about William Elliott. The movie came in under two hours, surely there was enough time to tell the real story that she conveyed in the book. In the movie his interest in Anne looked like opportunism and diminished her great qualities as a character. He did still have his fortune and wanted to succeed to the baronetcy but he genuinely admired Anne (I won't go so far as to say he loved her since he wasn't capable of that).",1500249600,,980,4.626436781609195

The movie a piece of art with unique visual elements and shifts from one scene to the next.  Shot entirely on location in the UK, the scenes are rich, sumptuous, and realistic.

Her understanding of human behavior has never been better or more amusingly illustrated than here - in the scenes which contrast the goodwill, good sense, steadiness and love for life of some characters with others who have fewer or none of those qualities. The satire in regards to human flaws like pomposity is perfectly done. This is also my favorite ending of all the romantic films I've ever seen - it's actually a four-part ending beginning with the climatic letter scene, the other three following in gentle waves - alone at last, and walking away from the crowd; the card party in which we see two completely happy people impervious to any further criticism or interference; and most wonderful is the final scene which portrays not an end, but the beginning of a shared adventure. That's what any successful couple I've ever known was doing: partnering in a shared adventure.

I remember a friend reading ""Pride and Prejudice,"" and bemoaning, ""But nothing happens!"" Virginia Woolf said something along the lines of, their behavior in the drawing room, tells of their behavior in life. In other words, it may appear to be a small compass, but it is a metaphor for big action. This movie captures that perfectly. To some, it may seem small in focus, feel and stage. But if you think that this is a circumscribed stage on which honor, dignity, heartbreak, and foolishness still expand to their limits, it is a lovely telling of humanity. More than any other Jane Austen movie, this version captures that subtlety, the clever touches that tell us we are talking about heartbreak, loss, and love, even though the screen is small and it appears not...

743835,5,6303965415,"I know everyone loves Pride and Prejudice, but this is actually my favorite of Jane Austen's stories. I love that it's a story of second chances.  It features the most mature of her heroines.  She has loved and lost.  The heroine spends the entire movie in various states of mortification (which is sort of how I felt through my twenties.)  Everyone's needs and wants and even whims take precedence over her but she is stoic and keeps marching on.  Her old flame returns unexpectedly.  She has no idea what he has been thinking of feeling for the last 8 years, and he has no idea what she has been thinking of feeling the last 8 years.  It's fantastic.

My only criticisms of this particular adaptation are that the actors are way too old looking (they are supposed to be 28 ish) but I will excuse it, because she is supposed to be a bit of an old maid and a modern audience would likely have a hard time seeing a 28 year old that way.",1483833600,2,935,4.3028571428571425

Root and Hinds really capture the weariness and hopelessness (and great integrity) of Anne and Wentworth as we begin the story. Of all of Austen's leading characters, these two so deserve a happy ending.

The Elliot family and the countess Dalrymple are buffoonish, but really so awful it's hard to laugh at them as Austen wants us to -- maybe we are looking at them through Anne's eyes.

This movie is beautifully filmed on the best locations (Bath is gorgeous!), but the direction and acting is controlled and understated in the very best way.

There are so many good Austen movies and series out there, but the only one that really compares with this one for dramatic impact is Joe Wright's 2005 Pride and Prejudice with Kiera Knightly.",1483142400,6,852,4.704697986577181

743964,4,6303965415,"Ive been snowed in and decided the cure was a total Persuasion binge. This meant reading the book and watching both movies (the 1995 and 2007 versions). I had read/watched all of these once before and used to think I liked them about equally, but experiencing them right on top of each other persuaded me otherwise (sorry, obligatory bad pun).

First, the book: I didn't pick up on this the first time I breezed through it, but now it seems all too obvious that Austen (who died six months before Persuasion was published) simply ran out of time. The bones are there, and they are good bones, but much of the prose doesnt have the Austen sparkle, and the players aren't as sharply drawn as usual. In all her novels, Austen tended to give each of her characters a biting little introduction, then back it to the hilt with dialogue and action that showed precisely who her people were. In Persuasion, we just get the broad idea. I enjoy Annes sister Mary, for example  her lack of self-awareness makes for some of the books best comedy  but shes still a one-note character, always whining about her own importance. Elizabeths sister Mary, stuck for the whole length of Pride and Prejudice in an awkward teenage phase, actually feels more like a real human being even though she has barely a handful of lines.

Anne suffers the most from this treatment though. Supposedly she is a very accomplished woman with a fine mind, and supposedly everybody (except her terrible family) knows this about her, but rarely is this fine mind shown in the novel (even though Austen does let us in on some of Annes thoughts, nearly all of them mortified musings about Captain Wentworth). Once Anne discusses poetry and once Anne reads Italian, and that is about it. It is clear that Anne is capable  she does all the things no one else wants to do or is calm enough to do  but nobody thinks of Anne except when they need her. No one seems interested in Annes inner life, and Anne makes no effort to be interesting, but all of the sudden three men are interested in marrying her (Captain Wentworth, Mr. Elliot, and briefly, Captain Benwick). Benwick is pretty easy to explain, because hes in a dark period and desperately needs to fall in love with someone, anyone (and soon rushes on to love Louisa). Wentworth, of course, has been pining for Anne for years, and Austen leaves him to stew in his nostalgia. There are no scenes of Anne being delightful and Wentworth falling in love with her afresh; instead they both work overtime to avoid each other, making for the tension that drives the whole novel. Its effective in and of itself, but it gives us no glimpse of the Anne who inspired all this pining in the first place, no hint of what Anne must have been like when she was young and happy and hopeful. The last suitor, Mr. Elliot, is the hardest to understand. It seems like it would have been simpler to just say Mr. Elliot was looking for a way to safeguard his position as her fathers heir, but Austen goes on to insist that his attachment to Anne is sincere, and I just don't see how it can be, given that he barely knows her and Anne is so buttoned down you cant know her without lots of effort.

Despite all this, Persuasion is undoubtedly good. You get the sense of what Austen was trying to accomplish, even when she doesnt quite pull it off. If shed had the time to flesh out and polish the characters a little more, it would have been one of her best novels.

Persuasion movie (2007)

One thing I absolutely loved about this movie was the soundtrack. It was beautiful and moody and captured the relentless pressure and tension of Annes feelings.

But in pretty much every other respect, I felt this version was inferior, especially coming right after Id read the novel. Sally Hawkins is a talented and intelligent actress, but her interpretation of Anne is bizarre. Shes so visibly distraught for most of the movie that she looks ill. Annes family members come across as foolish and unpleasant, but never manage to give the comic relief they are supposed to. Rather than just selfish, Mary seems certifiably neurotic. Tobias Menzies is a compelling Mr. Elliot, probably more menacing than Austen intended but still fun to watch.  Rupert Penry-Jones as Captain Wentworth is okay  he is accurate, he plays it by the book, but he doesnt add anything to the role.

Persuasion movie (1995)

Forgive me, hardcore Janeites, but I enjoyed this even more than I enjoyed the book. It has flaws as well, but Amanda Root and Ciarn Hinds bring so much quiet warmth and personal charm to their roles that their mere presence fleshes out the characters and their motives (which helps a lot, since neither of them get to say much of anything to the other). Annes family is funny, and theres a great scene where Anne moves from chair to chair as everyone pours out their confidences to her, and she looks more exhausted and more amused with every switch. Mr. Elliot is pretty forgettable, but they do change the plot here to make him a mere fortune-hunter, and only pretending to be in love with Anne, which makes more sense, especially considering how little time they spend together. The movie suffers a bit from low budget or perhaps just age  I would have welcomed a more emotive score, better cinematography and better costumes, its not the kind of lush period production that were used to now  but its never so bad it distracts from the storytelling.

In short, if you are trying to choose between the three of them, this is the one to get.",1482537600,3,5525,4.5872210953346855

744515,5,6303965415,I love Jane Austen.  She is one of my favorite authors.  This particular movie rendition of Persuasion is a good one.  Jane Austen wrote about the quirky behaviors of the landed gentry and this screen adaptation beautifully displays their silly behaviors as background for a touching love story about a young woman who was persuaded to give up the love of her life because her family did not approve of him.  I thought Amanda Root did a splendid job portraying an intelligent young woman living with her foolish family members while longing for the love they persuaded her to forgo so many years earlier.,1474156800,,604,4.778846153846154

You must invest your whole attention into watching this production - it isn't as viewer-friendly as the Sue Birtwistle productions, but it is very good.  You can believe that these two people of average looks were kept apart and are somehow navigating through society's norms to find a way back together.  I love the many small touches - the way the staff refuses to look at the Baronet Eliot when he leaves his home, the physical appearance of the sailors rowing the dinghy to the ship and undergoing inspection, the cart loaded with livestock Anne must ride to her sister's home.  It's not the glamorous world we think of, but probably more realistic.",1473465600,12,712,4.764227642276423

This cast is a bit less glamorous than the cast of the more recent one. That is not a problem, more of an observation.

The movie is excellent. It varies a bit from the book, but don't all book-based movies vary in their own way. The book can have some rather long drawn-out areas that would be difficult to fit in this length movie.

After a few viewings I noticed a few area where I wondered why did he/she do that and I had to reread the book for clarification. I guess the first few times I watched it I was too busy gazing at Ciaran.

But I'm not quite sure how to feel about this one. I have not read the book Persuasion. This movie made me curious to try, which is a credit to the film, but not really in a good way. I found myself thinking, surely Miss Austen did not write the characters so strangely. Such an awkward assortment of characters I have never witnessed! Good gracious, not only were they awkward and almost entirely unpleasant, but they shared a universally haggard appearance which was somewhat unappealing and distracting. I understand that they were going for realism, but I have to wonder if they read the novel. Even though I haven't, I know enough to think that this Anne is much too old to really be considered eligible or desirable. She would be an old maid in that period. And she looked it. I scarcely understood the characters' relationships to one another, and still don't. Will have to Wikipedia it. The majority of the characters were highly aggravating and unpleasant, or simply flat and wooden. I could not tell WHATSOEVER that Wentworth loved Anne so much as his letter described. Whose idea was it to cast this guy? Yeesh. Despite all these complaints, I still found the story interesting enough, and liked Anne's character traits very much, though she became spacey, obsessive, and weird towards the end.

The characters sound human when they speak and not like they are just reading from their scripts.  You can imagine that this is how people spoke in the 19th century - not like pompous orators, but like real people. The world surrounding isn't overly polished or brightly lit; there's a natural, ""lived-in"" feeling to all the buildings and landscapes which match the story's time period.  The performances.of the actors aren't conventionally beautiful or handsome either.

745832,4,6303965415,"This was a good solid production of Persuasion.  However, they changed the plot unnecessarily--in this production they threw out William Elliot's betrayal of Mrs. Smith after the death of her husband and turned it into a subplot that William had spent all his money and was trying to marry Anne for money.  That doesn't even make sense, because the book/movie begins with the family having to move out of the ancestral home in order to economize, plus there is never any mention of Anne having any independent income.  Other than that, I enjoyed the movie very much.  Great chemistry between the stars.",1454976000,2,602,4.872549019607843

745834,5,6303965415,"This is my favorite Austen story.  I've read the book several times and bought this DVD years ago.  I decided to purchase it on Amazon to be able to watch it whenever/wherever I wanted. It never gets old.  I love the idea that mistakes can be made when young because of seemingly important influences at the time, but they can be rectified later through perseverance (and as you get older you learn to slough off what everyone else demands of you and make the right decision for yourself).  In the real world, both characters probably would have rebounded, married and had kids, and when they met again would have had an affair or have been saddened by the realization they made big mistakes they could never take back.

Austen stories have easy, happy endings that make you feel better rather than walk away feeling regret.  And they also make fun of propriety, female roles/limitations, and make light of potentially bad situations.  Nothing is every really messy, so her stories are easy to read and give you a break from hard reality.

Ciaran Hinds (who I always call 'Caesar' now thanks to HBO's Rome, which was the perfect role for him) is wonderful in this movie.  Amanda Root is perfect in the role of Anne.  Some of the other characters do leave something behind from the book, but that's to be expected in an adaptation.",1454716800,,1330,4.645299145299146

745963,1,6303965415,"Would not recommend.
I hate to say it but the whole movie was odd and shockingly, very ugly.
The heroin's expression was ""confusion"" throughout the film and her love interest came across as very intimidating, dominant and opposite of what I would imagine for a romantic lead.
There was also the age factor. I don't remember the leading roles to be this old. Towards the end, the heroin was expected to become vibrant and lively but of course you can hardly tell because in this film, she looks pretty much the same: Old, drab, confused. The lack of chemistry between the two leading roles were hard to ignore, which for me, is the kiss of death concerning romantic films.
The scenery was something that I look forward to with period films but I wasn't impressed here either.
The ill (ugly) manners displayed by almost everyone in the film was hard to watch as well.
Like others have said, the entire film seems to drag on forever for me most likely due to the reasons explained above.
Although not an avid Austen fan, I was expecting something more entertaining. Surprisingly though, many people seem to be pleased with this film so if you're interested maybe you might enjoy it.",1454198400,,1179,4.673076923076923

Although I do like Amanda Root in this movie, she and Ciaran Hinds are older- Anne Elliot is supposed to be 27 years old, and Frederick Wentworth  30 years old. There isn't much chemistry between them and the emotional intensity of the 07' version is lacking. I may watch this movie one once more and pass it on.",1453766400,,461,4.2988505747126435

746472,5,6303965415,"An excellent and realistic portrayal of this story. Not the typical polished period piece where everyone's clothes are brand-new and they've all just stepped from the shower to the makeup department. Clothes look used and people look natural. But the acting is excellent, particularly Amanda Root's. At all stages of the story she uses extensive nonverbal means to communicate what's going on inside. Her big puppy-dog eyes go a long way towards accomplishing this. Her character comes across as someone I'd like to know, particularly when you contrast it to her nasty family. John Woodvine and Fiona Shaw give a splendid portrayal of Admiral and Mrs. Croft. People with hearts of gold but a bit rough-and-ready. Much the same feel you get from the Hornblower series.

Definitely recommend!",1438819200,2,790,5.171875

746551,4,6303965415,"Loved the richness of this film. It captures Regency England wonderfully well, and the actors are well chosen for their parts (though I thought the actresses playing the Muskgrove sisters would have been better if they'd switched parts). You can't help being amused, as Austen intended, by the ridiculous narcissism and false values of so many characters. I only have one issue with the film, and that is how unrelievedly tragic and ""silently suffering"" Amanda Root plays the lead role. At times it came across as more Lifetime for Women than Jane Austen.

On another note, any unsuspecting buyer who is unfamiliar with the story will be lead astray by the summary on the back of this dvd: ""A young couple's stormy romance scandalizes society in this acclaimed adaptation of Jane Austen's classic love story."" Anyone looking for racy scandal is going to be disappointed.",1437523200,2,870,5.0

And I did NOT, could NOT see the appeal in who they chose to cast as the leading lady, Anne. Really? I couldn't stop staring at her mouth, her skeletal eyeballs, and her weird bangs.

I actually became intetested in the movie after watching a Sandra Bullock movie and the book was mentioned in it.

747323,5,6303965415,"The seemingly impossible has happened: I've finally found a Jane Austen adaptation I love as much as the acclaimed BBC 1985 version of Pride and Prejudice and Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility! After finishing this 1995 version of Persuasion, I was shocked to see that it was only 103 minutes. It felt longer----not because the pace was sluggish (it was actually quite smooth!), but because I felt like I had gotten to know these characters, both the major and minor ones, so unusually well and been on such an immensely satisfying journey with them. I confess that I was a little conflicted over Hinds' Frederick during his first couple of scenes, as he seemed a little slicker and more overconfident than I had envisioned the character. Soon, though, we see that he's an incredibly genuine, emotional, passionate and honorable man. Amanda Roots' Anne Elliot evolves naturally from a sweet and endlessly patient but more reticent and passive figure to a woman of quiet strength who is determined to finally pursue her own happiness. The story is subtly poignant (in contrast to the more melodramatic, emotionally overwrought 2007 version, which I also enjoyed but didn't feel was nearly as true to Austen's story or style!) As with all of the best Austen adaptations, there's tons of sly wit and insights into human nature that are every bit as relatable today as they were then. It's visually striking, and the dialogue is deliciously rewind-worthy. If I had to offer up one complaint, it might be that Anne's sisters Elizabeth and Mary are a bit exaggeratedly awful to the point where I sort of dread their appearances, but you could also say that their flaws add humor to the film. Either way, that's a VERY minor quibble over a film that's in my opinion deserving of the highest praise. Enjoy!",1423267200,15,1802,4.872964169381108

747326,5,6303965415,"This is an amazingly realistic feeling historical drama. It seems like the director really went out of their way to show not only the glamorous bits, but also the kind of grubby parts of life in the 19th century. You see shots of sheep, mud, and poor people through out. The costuming is just freaking amazing, beautiful, but still look like they've been worn (especially the navy uniforms).

The two leads are wonderful as are many of the supporting actors (love the wicked sister and slimy cousin!)

This has less glamor than some newer productions but much more heart.",1423008000,,571,4.757575757575758

747488,4,6303965415,"I much prefer this version of Persuasion to the one with Sally Hawkins as Anne Elliot.  Amanda Root is far more appealing as Anne and the script seems truer to the book although, understandably, liberties are taken in both versions. While Ciaran Hinds may not be as handsome as Rupert Perry-Jones, he makes a more believable naval hero, and the closing scenes of their reconciliation are much more suitable to the era than all the running about in the Hawkins adaptation.
Unfortunately, the supporting characters are a mixed bag.  I found Anne's elder sister Elizabeth almost crude and her cousin William Elliot too patently sly - neither role as well presented as in the Hawkins version; however the rest of the cast, in both versions, does a very good job of bringing this Austen work to life.",1416355200,2,795,4.795620437956204

747517,5,6303965415,"I am very fond of this particular adaptation, I also found the remarks made in the reviews quite interesting, telling me more about the people reviewing and our modern standards, than they do about the film. We do currently set a high requirement for physical beauty in our actors don't we?  I thought Amanda Root was perfect in this role. She played her resigned- to- spinsterhood life well, capturing her remarkable patience towards her self centered family.  I found her quite lovely in a subdued way which suited the role. She blossoms into herself, but gently and quietly as the film progresses. I have enjoyed the portrayal of Captain Wentworth and loved his confrontation scene with Lady Russel. All manners but with great intensity. This was not an over the top performance to me. He demonstrated very effectively contained bitterness carefully couched in polite manners All the characters well done. The only weakness to me was Mr Elliot and this was primarily because of lack of the character's development. As to the music, I found some of it quite charming but there are places that it annoyed me, not so much because of the style, but it did not seem to fit some scenes effectively. I noticed it far too much in those scenes. It is my only complaint, and a minor one, in an otherwise lovely film.",1414108800,2,1309,4.7368421052631575

It's not cold at all, and the understatements only serve to make the love story more effective and meaningful. I thought this movie was a very good rendition of the book.

Not all great love stories are about a beautiful person.  Although it may not appeal to others, and some might find it slow-paced and somewhat boring, let me express that that is the beauty of it.  Like all great art, it evokes a feeling or a reaction.  The story reflects the period of time where things were much slower and less action-packed.  If you can stick with it,  it is a great story. One of my favorite of the Jane Austen stories,  the theme of ""watching the rest of the world go by"", and finding fulfillment later in life resonates with my own personal life.",1404345600,3,694,4.417322834645669

One thing they did in the film, which I found a bit jarring, having just reread the novel, was to add scenes or extend existing scenes to show you what people and things looked like at the time.  There was more of that sort of thing than in other dramatizations of Austen novels, but I soon got used to it.

Of course, none of that is in the novel because Austen was writing for a contemporary audience who didn't have to be shown such things.  None of the added material involves dialogue, which was taken accurately from the novel, though sometimes in abbreviated form.

I strongly recommend this film version of Persuasion.",1402012800,2,792,4.614285714285714

Jane Austin's stories are always a favorite, but I find this one to be especially appealing. The themes of debt, social status, and the conflicts within a woman with a sound mind in a society that doesn't know any better are good therapy.  The sound track itself is part of setting the mood for the quiet conversations that belie the powerful message. Definitely give it a try.  If you can't take the antiquity or the understatedness of the film, o.k.  As for me, I'm still watching it again and again--and loving it.",1401840000,5,661,4.43801652892562

747890,5,6303965415,"If you love or have a deep interest in humanity, you're a student of character. Jane Austen is all about character. Nothing reveals character as power (much or none).  Austin sets up conflicts to reveal character.  In her books, the principal character is a woman (strong, intelligent but powerless in the time period). Watch as Austin sets up daily struggles and encounters  to reveal character. You'll probably be fascinated both by the characters and Austen's skills and perception IF character interests you.  In Persuasion, the heroine's suitor was rejected by family pressure (suitor had neither money, connections, nor position). Eight years later he re-enters heroine's life as a wealthy, respected, navy captain. Is love strong enough for the Captain to overcome
his previous rejection. So much for the plot.  No one will be disappointed by the acting and period scenes.  Don't overlook the Admiral (powerful yet amiable) and his constant companion (his wife) as the model of true love.",1401494400,,995,5.226415094339623

Their actors aren't simply beautiful for the sake of beauty but relish character and individuality with being comely.

I like all Jane Austin films except this one and the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice that had zero production values.  I haven't seen the later version of this film, but I have seen everything else and this one falls to the bottom of the heap.  Plus everyone was just filthy all the time.

748442,5,6303965415,"Though I adored Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility and the version of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, I still consider this my favorite adaptation of any of Austen's novels.

I think viewers who are a little bit older, who know that there are few second chances to be had in life and that everything may dissipate over time--beauty, health, wealth and social standing- might find it more stirring and its naturalistic settings more to their taste. There is no plastic surgery or use of cosmetics here, no flattering costuming or lights--and so people are seen for themselves, in all their rawness with all their blemishes intact, as Anne Elliott's narcissistic father is so fond of pointing out, though he is only aware and speaks to the surface of things.

Amanda Root in the title role embodies Anne Eliot, a woman of great intelligence but faded looks, who is finding her life diminishing in every way. Her social position is falling due to her father's spendthrift ways and she has lost her chance with several suitors, most notably naval captain,  Fredrick Wentworth , a man who has made his own fortune in the interim, and who returns to her world looking for a wife. Ciaran Hinds as Wentworth smolders with contained bitterness and resentment in Anne's company and yet is still perceptive and open enough to forgive the pain her rejection caused him [ personally, I've loved Hinds' work since seeing him in December Bride and find him most attractive ]. How they find their way back to each other is at the heart of the story--and it is so lovely and touching that even though I knew the plot --and have seen the movie countless times--my heart always thunders with anxiety during the final scenes prior to that exquisitely tender final kiss.
The supporting cast is terrific and the screenplay to my mind is even better than the unfinished book. If you are tired of surface prettiness and gloss and want to see life as it truly may have been lived in the early 19th century, then this adaptation is for you. Highly recommended.",1396051200,,2061,4.751396648044692

The movie held our attention throughout, but the ending seemed quite abrupt in comparison with the pace of the rest of the film.  The rest of the story develops very slowly and gives one a good glimpse of the social attitudes of this period.

With the exception of a somewhat campy performance by Phoebe Nicholls who played the elder sister of the heroine Anne Elliott (Amanda Root), the performances are well balanced.

Persuasion provides a decent diversion and would be appealing to those fans of period English movies.",1395878400,2,600,4.97

For example, the Keira Knightley ""Pride and Prejudice"" is beautiful to look at, but so far off from the sensibility of that book that I can't bear to watch it. This adaptation of ""Persuasion"", which happens to be my second favorite of the novels, adheres much more to the actual character of the book and uses much of the original language, which has always been one of my main problems with adaptations of Austen. ""Persuasion"" has an autumnal flavor, and you see this expressed visually throughout this film. The costuming and sets are brilliant. The actors are, by and large, well cast, but I have a few quibbles to make with them: I would have picked a prettier Anne, for starters. The evil Mr. Elliott is too young for someone who has already married and been widowed. Sister Elizabeth is far too petulant and not nearly handsome enough. Captain Hargrove expresses his feelings very well, but I was too much distracted by his rabbit teeth. However, I did enjoy the portrayals of Captain Wentworth, the Admiral and Mrs. Crawford, and Mrs. Musgrove very much. Overall, I will give this version four stars, because I am rather hard to please. If you want to see an almost-perfect adaptation of Jane Austen, see the A&E multi-part version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" - its perfection is only marred by an over-the-top performance of the role of Mrs. Bennett.",1395014400,,1421,4.757085020242915

748656,5,6303965415,These classical video productions put modern times in perspective.  But the themes old or modern--are the same.  This is escapism plain and simple.,1394582400,,147,5.3478260869565215
748657,4,6303965415,"This movie, though it does end with a matrimonial  ""happily ever after"", invokes such a feeling of sadness, loneliness and regret, that when you think it was written by a 40 years old spinster ( in 1817,  40 was considered OLD )  on her death bed It's difficult to think of it as any other thing accept regretting what could have been.  Perhaps Austen had given her Heroin the life she would have wanted for herself, perhaps not, but the similarities between her and her protagonist made me look on this film very differently than other  novels.

This is a very nuanced and  slow adaptation of Austen's last novel, publishes after her death in 1817. Unlike other Austen's protagonists who are young, energetic and beautiful, Anne Elliot  is 27 years old, her youth and charms already fading away. In the terms of those times she is way passed her prime and is quickly entering the phase when she'll be considered a spinster unfit to be married. Ann has quietly resigned to spending the rest of her life in the service of her self centered father and sister, unappreciated and overlooked.  But Her quiet existence is completely shaken by a the return of Capt. Wentworth, whom she turned down 9 years ago, following advice from her friend, who thought he is not socially and financially suitable.  Wentworth is now a successful and wealthy officer, having made his fortune, and is sought after by much younger and prettier woman than Anne. Still - hopes and feelings Anne worked hard to abandon rise in her, despite herself. Capt. Wentworth, though cold and resenting at first, seems to have the same inner war with his feelings.

The power of this movie adaptation lies in the way it portrays the small, stifling country life of women in that class, much similar to how Austen herself lived  - limited to a small circle of friends and family, mundane and uneventful. We see how The whole production accentuate this mundane existence in the ultra realistic  way it presents the people and their life -  the actors appear ""au naturel""  without makeup,  ( like ordinary people look ) their hair kind of sweaty and disheveled. This could actually put you off, as some look like in dire need of a bath. I myself had the urge to grab a bottle of shampoo and a hose and to give them that bath. This strips the actors of all the glory and romanticism  we usually adore so much in period movies. We do not get stunning cinematography of mansions and gardens, but instead we see people as they were then, so much similar to the way we are now - their house is messy, the breakfast table not clear yet, their children running around annoying them.  We get a close look into their lives - there's a wonderfully comic scene in which Ann, visiting her married sister, listens on 3 separate occasions to her sister complaining about her in laws, the in laws complaining about her sister, and the sisters in law complaining about both. It's very amusing but at the same time you feel how horrible it must have been for people to be trapped in their dull lives this way, and appreciate why a simple visitor  or a stranger could stir so much excitement . On the other hand - Capt. Wentworth and his colleagues from the Navy are the opposite of confinement and dull. They have ventured beyond the strict social and financial hierarchy and have the power to alter their status and future. Their lives are free and full of possibilities. We see how envious Ann is of them  taking charge of your own fate, in a way, she, as a woman, can never take.

Casting  of the actors goes hand in hand in the realistic feel of the movie. Both Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds ( playing Anne and Capt. Wentworth ) are not what you would  normally call pretty or handsome. Hinds, though Manly and quite impressive in his quiet way, is no dreamy Mr. Darcy, and Root certainly looks like a 30 year old  woman who gave up on herself, which gives their romance and happy ending so much more power and truth  than glossy Pride and prejudice. Love is not only the privilege of beautiful heroins and their gallant admirers, it is a miracle that happens to the most ordinary of people. We all have hope yet :)",1394409600,5,4161,4.545576407506703

I watched the movie before reading the book and was surprised to find that the movie stays pretty close to the action in the text.

748687,3,6303965415,"I've previously watched the BBC 2007 rendition of this Jane Austen classic, starring Sally Hawkins, and must say that I prefer it to this one. I found this version to be a little slow and boring, particularly in the earlier scenes. I think the acting and cinematography in general is better in the 2007 rendition, even if it isn't as true to the book as this version. There was just much more tension and it felt more realistic. In this version Anne's relationship with Wentworth is awkward, and not in the good way. At times she seems overly eager to speak to him, despite his cold attitude towards her, which just makes her look foolish when she is clearly not meant to be portrayed that way( I mean she is the only one with any sense and competency in her family). I don't know if it was the writing or the actors/actresses themselves but I just wasn't feeling it. Someone in another comment mentioned that ""the kiss"" was very well done, but I have to disagree. It doesn't even compare to the 2007 version. The suspense, timing, and emotion there is far superior, in my opinion.

the book and the movie begin well after the fact that the two main characters had had a relationship which was torn apart by circumstances.
the movie should have brought that event into the forefront of the storyline.  i may as well have been reading the book and not have wasted my time watching the movie.  a movie which is based on a book should bring the book alive.  it should make the characters seem bigger than life.  the people who have read the book and later c the movie should come away w/a new appreciation of the book.  but, i didn't like the confusion of characters.  didn't like that the 'young lovers' were never shown so i couldn't appreciate their dilemma in meeting again and the awkwardness or pain they may be experiencing.
the actors chosen to play each role was poorly selected.  let me put it plainly.  they were ugly.  poorly costumed.  badly presented.  no accuracy whatsoever.  no woman in victorian times would have had short hair!!!!  not unless she had suffered from scarlet fever and had to have her hair shaved off.  she would have been ashamed of having short hair.  also, women did not have 'bangs'.  it was never the hairstyle but tight curls across her face would have been a possible style.  i like accuracy in historical pieces.
lastly, i DO NOT RECOMMEND this movie.  terrible acting, wardrobes, plot, etc, etc.",1391212800,2,1506,4.618867924528302
748955,5,6303965415,"First, I have to confess, I am not a big reader of Austin.  I know that sets me apart from many who have posted here.  But it also might well give me, and others like me, an advantage when it came to reacting to this movie, as I did not come to the movie with preconceived ideas of how these characters should be played.

I've seen this movie many times, and I never tire of it.  I've now read, after first viewing the film, the novel.

Why does the film work as well as it does?

First, it's based on a mature, thoughtful, unusual novel.  A novel the themes of which move far beyond boy-meets-girl, girl-seeks-boy, everyone is desperate to marry and so on.  Persuasion is a novel that, in my opinion, is motivated most deeply by a  heartfelt need to explore our uncomfortable, but universal, regrets and questionings of decisions we have made earlier in life.  In this case, as in all of Austen, these emotions and inner scrutinies are played out against a backdrop of romance, difficult  family relations, and youthful confusion.

Do we get second chances?

Not often, if at all.  What might happen if one is so lucky, so fortunate to have the chance to 'undo' a prior, once believed correct, but now recognized as wrong-headed, decision?

So, the movie's thematic material is timeless, universal, poignant, and relevant.  But what makes this movie such an unabashed delight is its pitch-perfect staging, costuming, lighting, and settings.  As well as its just as apt casting and acting.  And more generally, its overall tone and ambiance.  I believe every character in this--believe that this or that person lived, breathed, and moved about as portrayed and shown.

It's rare for me, or anyone I know, to say that about a movie.

Like so very many today, I am a fan of the Masterpiece Theatre series, Downton Abbey.  Downton bears similarities to this, in general terms, but is set a century later, and is, in other respects, quite different.  But in one respect I believe the two can be compared, and that is that the folks behind the thunderous accomplishment that is Downton Abbey have felt obliged, for reasons I don't understand, to make every, or very nearly every, character good looking, if not beautiful, and somehow removed from us, distant, touch-me-not.

I adore Downton, but I don't 'believe' Downton, not really.  Its characters, with few exceptions, are simply too 'elevated' to be believable, even the downstairs crew (with the notable exceptions of Mrs Hughes, Mrs Patmore, and Sophie, and is that why they are so compelling?).

But, Persuasion, set precisely two centuries ago, I believe:  I can hear, smell, and touch these people.  I could imagine them walking into a room, my room.

Exactly how a director and his or her crew create this effect, I do not know, not being a movie maker.  But I believe that it begins with a commitment to including, along with the myriads of historically accurate details of scene, dress, and manner, an unashamed insistence that the actors, costumes and sets be real.  That crumbs litter a breakfast table, that hems be muddy after a long walk, that ladies shoes look flimsy and unsupportive, that a man's duster be imposing and even dashing, but a bit grimy.  After all, how in heaven did one launder a duster, of all things, in the early 19th century?

So, I applaud this movie.  It's true--to the novel, to its themes, to history, and to its times.

How many movie makers can pull that off?",1391126400,2,3450,4.721943048576215

749142,3,6303965415,"I was not familiar with the Jane Austin novel that this movie was based on.

This movie felt a little depressing and dragging.

The plot is pretty bland.  The most interesting twists are learned about in hindsight by word of mouth so you have to be paying attention to catch it.  It's kind of like, most of the interesting parts about this story are not shown, and instead you watch the boring parts (mostly).

This movie is basically a love story.  But there is no striving or drama.  Things just happen.

I was confused by Anne's initial reaction to the suitor.  Her eyes were wide and it was a strange expression that seemed a bit extreme.  Once learning of the background, the acting at this part still does not seem appropriate.  Additionally, she did not have a lot of the expected reactions you would expect a character to have being put in her situations.  But I feel that this was due to the script more than the actress.  Her reactions were so downplayed that instead of being able to empathize with the lead, you just feel disconnected with the emotion behind the story at hand.

The other characters were more flamboyant and you get the feeling that there is something special about the lead character.  But in the end you don't really get to know her except only fleetingly, and it is a bit of a let down.

On the upside, this is a calm movie that will gently transport you to another time and place, and it is enough to lightly hold your interest as it soothes you.  You get to enjoy some nice scenes of the countryside and ocean.  The outside views were nice, but most of the insides of houses were dark or cold and a bit depressing.

Overall, I didn't really like this movie very much.  If you are looking for a gentle calming period piece movie, you will probably like this.  If you are a fan of the novel you'll probably love it as others here do.  If you like any love story no matter what, you'll probably like this.  But if you come into this movie looking for intrigue, excitement, wonderful characters, or something to make you think, you will probably be disappointed.",1388102400,,2092,4.461741424802111

Austen's attempt to see Anne find herself out of a situation we all encounter (how much influence others should have in our decisions), is satirical yet kind. It's too bad this has less focus than Pride and Prejudice. This film brings the two center characters out without making Anne seem terribly recluse or Wentworth fickle to her. That alone is a delightful accomplishment with Anne having shut herself off (she doesn't smile until well after an hour in), Frederick spending time courting other women to forget her and no narration of inner dialogue. This may seem obvious, but too many movies made are incapable of expressing something without outward display. It's good writing and great acting.

The book is full of subtlety and maturity and the movie follows suit. The book is by an older Austen who has had experiences that have helped/ forced her to understand the long-term pain of love chances and the strictures of society and family. This movie captures that beautifully. The transformation of Ann physically throughout the movie is a great example. Early one she is pale and looks 'past her bloom' as they say. By the end, she's glowing. It's a beautiful & subtle movie, and I'm so happy it's on free streaming for prime members (right now).",1380758400,2,707,4.488372093023256

Yes, even Ann's beauty was gone, she should not look like a 50-years old cleaning lady.
It captures Jane Austen's story, it fails in its spirit. Anne is perhaps the most difficult character in all of Austen to portray. Her quiet strength and intelligence are hard to exude on screen. Amanda Root is simply not skilled enough to pull off such a challenging role, where the majority of her lines are unspoken. She portrays instead a dull and vapid creature, almost devoid of personality, When the character actually does have lines, her persona is so very different from the sullen woman portrayed through the rest of the film that it feels utterly incongruous.

Ciarn Hinds and Amanda Root both give stellar performances as former young lovers, who years later cross paths once again, their old flame re-igniting once more.

The entire cast, period costumes, and fabulous English Manors (and Bath!) all pull together to really make the viewer feel a part of the movie, and not just like they are observing from afar.",1379030400,,444,4.906666666666666
749584,5,6303965415,"There are so many movie versions of Jane Austen's books, and most are not worth the time to watch.  The screenwriters seem to think they need to add ""sex, drugs, and rock and roll"" to the story for a modern audience.  There are plenty such modern stories out there.  It is not Jane Austen's 1812 story when such changes are made.

This 1995 BBC production of ""Persuasion"" is faithful to the book (what a concept!), and the casting and the performances are perfect.  The dialogue is exactly from the book with new dialogue based on descriptions in the book for those scenes necessary to a screen production of a book. The settings and the costumes are appropriate to 1812 England.  The storyline is the one Jane
Austen wrote, and the characters are portrayed as Austen wrote them.  Overall, a beautiful production.",1379030400,,813,4.723404255319149

749649,5,6303965415,"A beautiful atmospheric rendition of Jane Austen's work.  Compellingly beautiful music impels the story line.  A pleasure that costuming seemed much more in keeping with the modest style of the times than is usually the case in costume productions, where one is typically subjected to the vulgar tastes of producers.  Perfect casting in all parts, acting, set design, lighting, a joy to watch. One is only sorry it has to end.  I agree completely with the reviewer though who pointed out that the rather grotesque carnival scene and music totally destroyed the moment when the two main characters finally resolve their differences.  Also, too bad directors think we can't live without an overdone kissing scene.  Not one of Jane Austen's novels has such a thing. Would have been nicer to include the compelling passage from the book instead, where the hero/heroine discuss their past misunderstandings while walking home in a blur of joy.",1377820800,2,938,5.098039215686274

749652,4,6303965415,"I enjoyed this adaptation of Persuasion, but the script was a little disjointed jumping from point to point.  The item that bothers me the most, was the choice of music at the climax of the film.  It was unfortunate.  The entire movie builds to one moment where our hero and heroine finally see eye to eye, and what do they have in the back ground?

A carnival.

Yes, complete with loud music that overtakes the scene and ruins the moment.

The music completely pulled me out of the moment.  Who wants to listen to goofy and silly music when the couple finally share a tender kiss? Then the film breaks away from the happy couple to show the details of the street parade, completely breaking up the scene. Carnival musicians, and clowns doing tricks.  Then eventually, it pans back to the couple, walking away hand in hand.

For this alone, I'd like to rate it 1 star.  But the actors did a splendid job and I don't want to hold it against them.",1377302400,,945,4.410404624277457

749655,4,6303965415,"I'm American so perhaps I just don't ""get it"" but to me both modern versions of Persuasion have lead actresses that are not attractive in any way. I understand that the ""bloom of youth is supposed to have waned a bit, but Amanda Root is Very drab here,looking to be in her late 30's not her late 20's. They do glam her up a bit 3/4 the way through the movie but her bland visage detracts from the bulk of the movie. Also,I would have had the part of Captain Bennick played by a less doughy,lumpy faced actor. It's not like his character is witty & charming, so you'd have to completely suspend belief to think that a young teenage girl would fall for him so quickly.
  The other actors fit into their characters well.
 The production, sound and dialogue are all first rate.... So much so that by the time you've gotten to the end of the movie, you're left with the pleasant happy ""buzz"",<which was the reason you chose a Jane Austen movie in the first place !>",1377216000,,960,4.322222222222222
749656,5,6303965415,"I have read every single book by Jane Austen and avidly collect all the movie/ series versions of her novels. Out of the three Persuasion versions I have come across to date this is certainly my favourite and the one that is most faithful to the novel. Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are simply brilliant as Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth. The people who complain about their looks and make-up have clearly never read the book. They are both older than typical Austen characters, they have gone through a tough time emotionally, they are sad. Their romance and emotional connection is subtle and restrained in keeping with the period. I was amazed by the array of emotions and nuances the cast was able to convey through gestures and looks alone. I am particularly impressed by the contrast their body language makes with their stiff Victorian dialogue, emphasizing their inner turmoil, their need to maintain appearances while secretly being in love but not at liberty to express it.

If you have read the book and have an understanding of the era you will not fail to enjoy this movie. If you expect Hollywood flash and face lifts, along with Harlequin type groping you will be sorely disappointed.",1377043200,3,1201,4.830097087378641

749796,5,6303965415,"Jane Austen's shortest novel is perhaps the most easily adapted to feature film length -- the others do better as serializations -- and this version is superb. Amanda Root as Anne Elliott starts as a sad and slightly depressed young woman who nevertheless always treats everybody well -- better than some deserve, in fact -- but who, when she gets a chance at happiness (after Louisa Musgrove falls in love with Captain Benwick) becomes positive and quietly active in her efforts to recapture the affections of her old love, Captain Wentworth. Ciaran Hinds is an ideal Wentworth, a naval man whose years at sea have rubbed some social polish from him but whose basically attractive directness and good-heartedness have survived. Corin Redgrave is the narcissistic Sir Walter, Anne's snobbish and fiscally irresponsible father, Sophie Thompson is perfect as Anne's limp sister Mary (who has married Charles Musgrove [Simon Russell Beale], who once courted Anne), and Susan Fleetwood (Lady Russell), Fiona Shaw and John Woodvine (as the Crofts, Sir Walter's tenants and Wentworth's sister and brother-in-law) are English theater stalwarts in relatively minor roles, though important to the plot. Sam West is the handsome but manipulative heir to the Elliott estate whom Wentworth thinks of, mistakenly, as a temptation for Anne.  The attention to the interiors (that mark social and economic standing) and costume is exemplary, and remarkably little that is important to the book is changed -- one might complain that Anne's elder sister, Elizabeth, a great beauty in the book, is not pretty enough here, and Mrs Clay, who is angling after the widowed Sir Walter, is also insufficiently attractive, when one remembers that good looks matter to Sir Walter almost more than anything.  And Anne's friend Mrs Smith comes across as more of an airhead than the chastened invalid of the novel.  Anne's final appearance on the deck of Wentworth's ship is maybe a step too far, and their very public kiss at Bath would not have happened as it did in 1814. But these minor quibbles don't diminish the achievement here -- the level of acting is very high and the film's handling of the romantic resolution is satisfying in the way the book's is.",1375315200,4,2232,5.059782608695652
749797,5,6303965415,"I'm not a Jane Austen expert like so many of the reviewers, but if you read the book and enjoyed it at all, you are not likely to be disappointed by this movie.  Unlike the 2008 version which leaves out important aspects of the storyline and has a preposterous ending, this one rings true in almost every way.  One exception worth noting is that in the book the Admiral is completely likeable and also a bit goofy or silly.  In this movie, he's quite charming, and not particularly serious but not silly either. I loved the portrayal of Mary, whose obnoxiousness was exquisite and not overplayed. Finally, the absolute best thing about this movie: Ciaran Hinds. He is one of those actors you simply can't take your eyes off of when he is onscreen.",1375228800,3,747,4.559701492537314

Unfortunately, the others are not freely available on Prime, so I am grateful for what I can access. I think of Jane's characters as being more subtle than these representations would reflect. In fact, for me, the power of Jane is her ability to write characters who almost seem okay, but upon deeper reflection, their character flaws become more obvious. It isn't that the actors weren't good enough; I think here my concern is about the lack of sensitivity in the direction. The storytelling has a clownishness that is not present in Jane's story. Quite the opposite. Jane has a finely developed sense of humor and displays it in her stories subtly and appropriately. This film version makes her characters seem foolish.

There have been several versions, and a more recent one for Masterpiece Classic had some great moments as well, but this really is the topper. Amanda Root is completely perfect as the small, quiet, dutiful daughter still suffering from her broken engagement years past. Her foppish father, by the late, great Michael Redgrave is equally spot on, with his arrogant proclamations. Her friend, Lady Russell, played by the late Susan Fleetwood, is wonderful, as she continues to ""guide"" Ann. I think one of the movie's strongest features is how realistic it seems. The clothes, the sets, the ease in which the actors interact, makes it appear as if it was all real, and not the result of a great novel. The actors aren't made up to be exquisitely beautiful--instead they all look quite natural, makeup and surgery free. It's another detail that makes this movie truly realistic and wonderful. You can feel the pain that Ann carries, and how her family ignores her. And you will adore Captain Wentworth, played with such intensity by Ciarin Hinds, another fantastic British actor.

But if you're a fan of Jane Austen, you know that she creates a very real depiction of life as she knew it.

750028,5,6303965415,"Persuasion is possibly my favorite Jane Austen novel, with its story of love triumphing over bad choices and inhospitable surroundings. I've read the book several times and still cheer for Anne as she slowly overcomes her family and reaches out to her one true love.

This is not a story that gets adapted for the big or little screen very often. It's a rambling story with no one central location and a lot of subplots that make up the tapestry of the story. The heroine is so virtuous she's almost too good to be true, and yet she has to be engaging and clearly wounded by life or you won't want to follow her for the whole story. And -- most important, I think -- it's almost impossible to capture the romantic lead, Captain Wentworth, onscreen. He's a bit of an enigma throughout Austen's novel, but he has to motivate the entire story. Producing Persuasion on screen is just as challenging, in it way, as producing Jane Eyre -- most of the Jane Eyre adaptations out there just don't capture Rochester, and without Rochester there is no story.

This 1994 BBC production of Persuasion hits it out of the park on all these fronts. Most obviously, Ciaran Hinds IS Wentworth, injured by love but a dynamic, powerful man. Through his sheer physical presence, subtle acting and the spot-on dialog he's given (most of it lifted directly from the book), he's completely believable as a man tormented by an old love rekindled, but also he's no wilting Romantic poet -- this is a man you could see commanding a ship of the line, a man who is rising through the naval hierarchy like a rocket, the James T. Kirk of the early 19th century.

Anne Elliot, as played by Amanda Root, is a similarly successful character. She's a wounded bird, large-eyed and wasting away, but through the writing of her dialog (again, mostly lifted intact from the book) and the sweet, engaging performance, she's immensely likeable and also (very important) believable as a woman of her time. Very slowly over the course of the movie, she blossoms into a beautiful, strong person not afraid to step out of the long shadow cast by her family.

And finally, the writing of this adaptation is wonderful. Somehow, the whole complicated story gets tucked up into a few hours, and yes there are some events omitted or streamlined, but none of the subplots are lost, the secondary characters are three-dimensional and true to the period, and it's all done at a liesurely pace that is true to Austen.

So, all in all -- if you're a fan of Austen and especially her novel Persuasion, this is the movie for you. It's a wonderful cozy few hours of romance and redemption.",1371168000,,2631,4.6373390557939915

750068,5,6303965415,"BBC is known for its excellence in adapting classic literature - in this case, I didn't even have to focus on the talent of the cast, because they looked so real (no overt glamour to cater to modern audiences) and behaved so realistically, that I forgot it was a story, and one that I know very well. Instead, I was as caught up in the plot as I was the first time I turned the pages of the book it's based on. There are a couple of scenes that were clearly added to help bridge the story for modern audiences (such as when Captain Wentworth speaks to Anne in the Pump Room), which I could do without, but because they don't damage or otherwise hinder the overall story, I'm happy to give them a pass.

All in all, just a beautiful, lovingly crafted tribute to a classic.",1370995200,,771,4.244897959183674

750226,4,6303965415,"I thought this was a faithful adaptation of Jane Austen's Persuasion.  The acting was excellent and the character's true to the story.  I would have probably given 4.5 stars, but couldn't give 5 stars because there was just a little too many camera shots of Amanda Root's big doe eyes and tight-lipped expression.",1369180800,,313,4.886792452830188
750227,3,6303965415,This version of Persuasion doesn't compare favorably to the 1971 BBC version that starred Ann Firbank. I suppose that trying to compress a five hour story into one and 3/4 hours didn't help matters. I will say that Amanda Root was a better Anne Elliot than Ann Firbank.,1368921600,,269,4.625

750282,3,6303965415,"Being an Austin fan helped me hang in there with this movie. Perhaps if your auditory processing skills are super sharp, you will enjoy it more than I. I struggled, particularly early on in the movie, following the British dialogue. I would try to increase the volume and replay, but that didn't really help. And there's nothing wrong with my hearing. However, that being said, the story is sweet and a study of a lifestyle that is quite foreign to 2013 America! Being somewhat of a historical fiction fan, made it worthwhile from that perspective. I would recommend it  for an escape from the speed of our overcommitted lives.",1368835200,4,627,4.752293577981652

I just have never been able to think of him as a romantic lead. He just lacks the right look.  Other than that, it is well cast and stays pretty close to the book.

Anne, a tired and responsible person who loves her shallow family and tries to do the right thing by them and others, has made so many sacrifices.  But her one regret is having allowed older ones to persuade her not to accept Captain Wentworth's suit at a younger age.  Then a second chance comes along, and we see the blossoming ""spinster"" come alive.  By this time, she is a woman who knows her own mind and has more self assurance than before she was persuaded at a younger age.

The romance unfolds subtly and the actress portrays the sadness of the main character at the beginning and the changes in her throughout the movie.  She is well-paired with the leading man.

750691,4,6303965415,"You can pretty much guess what I'm going to write here based on the title I've provided. Persuasion, in some respects Austen's best novel, receives a refined but honest treatment here, with none of the superficial glamor that has afflicted others. The acting is strong, the costuming believable, and the grime and disheveled look of the people a nice contrast to Stately Georgian Manors.

I have only one negative to note: the out of place, easy listening piano noodling that occurs at intimate moments throughout. It's as though somebody read that this was supposed to be an autumnal novel (and it is), and thought this had to be italicized, underscored, and boldfaced. At the very least, if that's what the director and producer wanted, they could have gotten some Mozart or at least pseudo-Mozart to reflect this; instead, they chose something that breaks the carefully crafted period sense of the visuals and sounds.

I can't say everyone is going to be as sensitive as I am to the music in a film--and that's good. Everybody should be different, and approach such things with their own preferences. I can only state how I feel about this. It's still a damn fine adaptation, and I would recommend it to anyone. Just keep my reservation in mind, if you're the kind who consciously listens to the background music when taking in a movie.",1362009600,,1339,4.817391304347826

750726,5,6303965415,"I love the works of Jane Austen; it's amazing how very different her novels are from each other, and how different her heroines are. I'm often disappointed in films made of Austen's novels, but this version of Persuasion is true to the novel and takes great pains not to idealize the dress and social customs of the period. The film also refrains from glamorizing it's heroine too much, or from making her too worldly. Anne Eliot is played to perfection by actress Amanda Root. Anne has none of the quick-witted vivacity of my favorite Austen heroine, Elizabeth Bennet from Pride and Prejudice. On the other hand, she is not as soppy and slow as my least favorite heroine, Fanny Price (Mansfield Park). Anne is educated and sensible, yet she is sensitive and interested in romantic poetry. She is a quiet woman living a quiet life, nearly a decade since experiencing what women of her time called a ""disappointment in romance"" and giving up hope of ever marrying. The daughter of a baronet, her family has fallen onto hard times while her former lover has risen in a successful naval career; what would have been an ""imprudent"" match 8 years ago would actually have worked out to her advantage. The story of the novel and the movie is set against this back story. This film version of Persuasion is a quiet film, a very refreshing un-Hollywood type of movie. It is also a very artistic movie; the visual aspect is beautiful--especially the artistic shots of the sea side at Lyme--and the sound track is spare and beautiful--the music is solo piano, and the absence of orchestral richness adds to the serene quality. Also, birdsong plays a large part in the background sounds, and the main crisis of the film plays out against a sudden silence intensified by the call of a song bird. All of these small gestures add up to a beautiful, spare, unglamorized film of a beautiful, spare, unglamorized Austen novel, a quiet story, well-told.",1360195200,,1934,4.758928571428571

The characters were okay, and I was able to sympathize with Anne; but Captain Wentworth did not appeal to me somehow- perhaps it was how he ignores Anne for most of the movie and seems slightly resentful. In so for as the other characters, Mary was very funny (""I am so ill..."") and Charles seemed a decent chap.

The only scenes that I really enjoyed were 1) when Anne first comes to Uppercrosse and Mary discusses her ""Illness"" and 2) When all Charles' family pour out there troubles on to Anne, and give advice about Mary's children. All the other scenes were unremarkable, and the scene when Wentworth admits that he is still in love with Anne is nearly laughable, what was with the circus being there? It just didn't make sense, and certainly wasn't touching.

750803,4,6303965415,"I really like this production of Persuasion as all the actresses/actors are so good - it's a real cinderalla story, with the underappreciated Ann finally gaining enough confidence in her own abilities to chose what she knows is best for her, and the audience gets to come along for the ride.  (SPOILER) Her captain, previously denied her hand, returns to the area, rich, successful and determined to ignore her, but the quality of Ann's spirit is such that she is impossible to ignore (she provides so much to all those she is around).  It doesn't hurt for her captain to learn that another kindly landowner (Charles, now her brother-in-law) previously found her desirable, and the captain also sees that his own man, Captain Bennett, and a Mr. Eliot, also find Ann appealing, and so, eventually, Ann's captain is able to let go of his hurt pride and ask for her hand again, and this time, a smarter Ann knows what to do.  After she learns the field is clear, Ann becomes very proactive - in fact, in the 19th century this Ann would have definitely been considered forward, if not a hussy.  Ann really pushes it, and it is great to see her go after her man.  The story of Ann and her captain, and her unappreciative family is well told.  The weak points in the story include the Mr. Eliot subplot - as Mr. Eliot was presented as a villan and wished to marry into the family not for love, but to better advance his agenda, and as Elizabeth obviously liked him, it would have made more sense for Mr. Eliot, as an opportunistic villan, to set his cap at Elizabeth - it made no sense for him to pursue Ann, when Elizabeth was there and interested.  So this villan made no sense, which was a story flaw.  Also, I didn't really understand the basis for the antipathy on Elizabeth's part toward Ann.  Had Ann been unusually beautiful I could have understood Elizabeth's jealousy, but both actresses were attractive enough, I didn't see that much difference between them physically, so I wish it had been explained why Elizabeth disliked Ann so.  Really, all the acting was very fine, Ann's father (Baron and proud of it, the senior Mr. Eliot), Ann's younger sister, Mary, the Musgroves - what a treat all these superb actresses and actors give us.  As I said, the only flaw I saw was the young Mr. Eliot story line, but this weakness didn't ultimately mar the story for me, I deducted one point for it, but if there was a 4 and a half star selection, I would have chosen that.  Really like this production.",1358035200,,2499,4.541202672605791

Amanda Root was well cast for Anne Elliot, and Ciarn Hinds and very fine and dashing Captain Frederick Wentworth. My favorite of the cast was Fiona Shaw as Mrs. Croft, she was simply perfect, sister to Captain Wentworth and wife to Admiral Croft (John Woodvine). Corin Redgrave an absolutely perfect and vain Sir Elliot, Samuel West made a scrumptious Mr. Elliot but, Phoebe Nicholls would have been better in a Cinderella story as an evil stepsister, she did not work at all (for me) as Elizabeth Elliot. Sophie Thompson, as Anne and Elizabeth's younger sister, did well in portraying the slightly spoiled, unhappy, hypochondriac, bored woman with a little too much pride and too little tact. And last but not least Susan Fleetwood as ""meddling"" Lady Russel.

The emotions between Anne and Frederick were a little understated, but I think that would have been the case given the time period. I did not doubt for a minute that it was hard for Anne to finally see Frederick again, though it was much harder to glean his feelings for her. It was subtle. Had I not read the book I would have thought him wholly indifferent towards her, up until he shows up in Bath. And I think that is the whole point of the story. Neither of them know for sure how the other one feel, but you don't get the whole ""EMO"" effect you would have seem if the story was written some 150 years later.

I also find that the movie stayed true (enough) to the book for my liking.

This film is very, very well made with superb acting by British actors, none of whom was familiar to me personally. It is refreshing to have such a variety of great actors who are not all distracting superstars and supermodels.

My only misgiving is that the Author (Austen) seems in this story to worship the Royal Navy and the life of a naval officer. Although the Royal Navy was undoubtedly more of a meritocracy than many other institutions at that time, one should bear in mind that it wasn't by being a choir boy that naval officers rose to riches and prominence at that time. Still, her bias is understandable (two of her brothers had great success in the Navy) and her portrayal of the contrast between men of inherited wealth and status with those who have attained it through ability is timeless.",1321920000,2,1039,4.550802139037433

751198,1,6303965415,"It's been a little while since I first (and last) watched this version of Persuasion, but I remember very well how much I disliked it.  I promised myself as soon as it ended that I would never watch it again.

Persuasion is a late novel, one of Austen's most autobiographical.  It's a story written by and about a woman who'd lost love and reconciled herself to never finding it again.  Nowhere in this adaptation does that idea come about.  And if you've honestly never read the book, I'm astonished you even know what's going on throughout the film.

And still more, one of the greatest things about Austen's novels is that they still have the power, even now, to make a reader feel exactly what the character feels.  Unfortunately, this adaptation of the novel has none of that power.  Even knowing how Anne feels in any particular scene (from reading the novel a dozen times), I still couldn't see any sort of emotion from Amanda Root--every emotion seemed to be exactly the same.  But, that said, Root by no means displayed the worst acting in the film.  That dishonor goes to Ciaran Hinds, who can't play a romantic character to save his life.  His acting is based on extremes--there's either too much emotion or too little.  He displays an intensity that's just a little bit too uncomfortable.  And for the two romantic roles I've seen him in (Wentworth in this and Rochester in the '97 Jane Eyre), he introduces a violent and quite frankly frightening side to his characters.  That's fine for a staged adaptation or something, but not for a film--it's a liberty that can completely ruin a character.  Austen's heroines love their heroes not because they represent forbidden pleasures and masochism but because they're men--usually just plain and simple men.

And even worse than the poor acting are the horrible age discrepancies between actors and characters.  It's one of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to film adaptations of beloved Austen novels.  The majority of Austen's heroines are in their early twenties--some are still in their teens--but it seems that when these characters are cast for a film, their ages are completely ignored.  In the case of this Anne Elliot, Root fits the part to begin with, but when Anne ""regains her bloom"" in the novel, nothing ever happens to Root, who still looks a little old and haggard.  And Hinds was 42 when he played the part of Wentworth, a character who is in his early to mid thirties, and he looked every day of his age.  I can understand casting for talent more than age, especially with a beloved classic such as Persuasion, but there's no talent here.  They could have hunted down a couple of university students who would have looked their part better and acted much better than the two leads.

For someone who has read the novel (or even someone who hasn't), I would suggest staying away from this verison of Persuasion.  Honestly, if you want to watch a version of Persuasion, turn to the '07 version.  It's not entirely true to the book, but the majority of the liberties they took with the story are acceptable, and the acting is immensely better.  An adaptation with a few good liberties taken can turn out to be better than an adaptation that claimsm to be entirely true to the novel.",1318032000,21,3257,4.700176366843033

I think that's why I love this book more than some others by Austen.  And for once the roles are reversed, it's the woman who was wealthy and had to reject a poor suitor.  So now she is forced to realize what she gave up.  I never go into plot details in a review, but this one follows the book fairly faithfully.

Characters are truly depicted. However, surely Anne Elliot could have had some facial expression other than deer-in headlights.

751207,4,6303965415,"Not meaning very great offense to other reviewers, but those who give this film 1 and 2 stars and claim that there is little of Jane Austen in this film must be very ignorant. Amanda Root's performance is exactly what I would expect to see as Anne Elliot onscreen. People complain about her and Ciaran Hinds as being too old; I call BS. Wentworth in the novel is in his mid-thirties, I believe, when he and Anne are re-united; Anne is 27, which was considered old in that time period. The point is that the characters have matured, it's been almost 10 years since they fell in love, of course they're not young anymore. Persuasion is largely regarded as Austen's most mature novel (which is one reason it is my favorite Austen novel). If you want youthful fluff, there's Pride and Prejudice, Northanger Abbey, or Emma.

If you are a Jane Austen fan, and especially if you love Persuasion, you should definitely see this movie. I mean, for God's sake, I just watched it for the first time 3 hours ago and am now watching it again!",1310774400,2,1029,4.502673796791444

751273,5,6303965415,"The 1995 Persuasion movie is not only my favorite adaptation of that particular book, it's one of my top five Jane Austen adaptations. And one of my favorite period movies. And just one of my favorite movies! It's just that good. The cast is excellent. I love the look and feel of realism it has too, similar to the 2005 Pride and Prejudice and Bright Star movies- realistic lighting, no makeup, messy  hair, etc.

Every adaptation has its flaws, and I guess I should just get them out of the way beforehand. This film contains one big historical error! The sailors often go about in their naval uniforms. While this looks really nice on screen, it is actually not accurate. As we know from Mansfield Park, these uniforms could only be seen while the officers were on duty. Probably most casual viewers wouldn't know this and it's cool to see them though. Another issue that doesn't really bother me in particular is the somewhat lacking exposition. I feel a little bit, that this movie was written with book fans in mind. If you weren't already familiar with the story, you might find it a bit confusing, especially in the beginning, what was going on between Anne and Wentworth. As I said, I had no problem following anything but since I had already read the book that doesn't really mean much.

The casting is admittedly not perfect. Many of the actors are a bit too old, but nothing jarring like in 1971. Their brilliant performances more than made up for this- with one big exception- Phoebe Nicholls as Elizabeth Elliot was way over the top.

Both the canceled and actual ending of the book were used. Some liked the addition, but I could take it or leave it, personally. Some of the other changes from the book may have worked as just a movie, but were lacking for me as an adaptation. Actually, I can say that about pretty much everything- there's nearly nothing in this movie that I don't like as just a movie.

Before I say again how much I love this movie (I ended up rewatching it 3 times!), I remembered another scene that bothered me. Anne is taken to Upper Cross in a farmer's cart instead of Lady Russell's carriage. Really? That was stretching it quite a bit. I know Sir Walter doesn't pay much attention to her, but he would never allow his daughter to be seen traveling in that way! And Lady Russell would never have allowed it! She couldn't spare her carriage to go 3 miles away??

All in all, admittedly, this movie is not perfect. But it's still a darn good movie and it's the closest to perfection any of the adaptations of Persuasion have gotten so far.",1304294400,2,2577,4.531182795698925
751274,4,6303965415,This version of Persuasion may look a little less glamorous than more recent dramatisations but the acting and cinematography more than make up for it. The story is compelling- what happens after you let the man of your dreams go because you are too young and he is too poor to make a decent husband?

751275,3,6303965415,"I didn't read the novel and from what I've gathered from other reviews, I might have missed something important.  I did have a little trouble figuring out the cast of characters in the beginning and the backstory, which is of prime importance, was not sufficiently emphasized.  The title, ""Persuasion,"" comes from the fact that the heroine, Anne, had been persuaded by an older woman who had stepped in as a surrogate mother, to refuse the proposal of marriage from a Captain Wentworth on the grounds that he was socially inferior to her family.

I guess I should have turned on the subtitles, earlier than I did, because I got the impression that the refused suitor was Wentworth's brother, a cleric.  Both clerics and sailors were considered to be unsuitable to Anne's advisor as well as to her super-snobby father.  So, when the Captain appeared, eight years later, I had a hard time understanding Anne's shocked demeanor.

So I can't blame the film entirely for my cluelessness for the first part of the film.  However I do blame the film for the casting.  Amanda Root, cast at the heroine, plays lackluster to such an extreme that one wonders what the Captain ever saw in her, let alone the fact that he carried a flame for her for the entire eight years of his absence.  True, she's a little depressed, but she's still young, in her twenties and most girls at that age have a little more spunk and color than she had.  She has turned into such a self-sacrificing drudge that one conjures up visions of Cinderella, especially when she's surrounded by the juicy, joyful and colorful girls who are her companions.

The Captain, played by the wonderful Ciaran Hinds, seems awfully old to be her suitor, but I suppose that older men frequently married young girls at that time.  There is zero chemistry between them and one wonders what a different film it would have been if a more interesting, lively, actress had been cast as Anne.  True, they put makeup on her later on and give her nicer clothes and a prettier hairstyle but she still emanates as much joy and passion as a piece of unbuttered toast.  She certainly embodies strength of character and reliability, but gee, give the Captain some reason to overlook all the other beauties and settle for her.  From the other reviewers who read the novel, I got the impression that Austen had written Anne as a much livelier young woman.

Other than that, it,s a good enough story, the rest of the cast is very good, the scenery is wonderful and the whole production lives up to what we have come to expect from British productions of classics.  It's certainly not a waste of time.",1303689600,4,2633,4.6645021645021645
751276,5,6303965415,"PERSUASION is a Jane Austen's less known book than PRIDE AND PREJUDICE or SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, written when the author was older. This book has a very refined and complex plot and many scholars consider that the heroin of this book, Anne Elliot, is one of the most complex characters that Ms. Austen created. I have readen all her books and I must agree with them. She is not the vivacious Elizabeth Bennett or the sensible Eleanor Darwood,or even the lovely Emma, but in Anne the aspect of introversion and reflexion are profound. It is not very easy to read her emotions, she conceals them very well, and being a very private person, her thoughts are not very easily apparent to the others. Her refusal of the proposal of marriage at 19 years old put her ""in the shelf"" and the reasons for this refusal are not very clear, but it seemed influenced by an older friend that thought that the impoverished pretendent was not ""good enough"" for the young Anne, daughter of a baronet. Since then, she lived for the confort of her family without any recognition. The return of her former pretendent to the place where she lives now makes her review her past actions and consider if the life that she is living now is better than the risk of the marriage at 19 with a man that she obviously loved. This is the plot of the romance and also of the movie. The richness and quality of the drama of Ms. Austen's book is well known but must be very difficult to portray in a movie of more or less than 2 hours. Fortunately for the fans this movie achieved this almost impossible task. With the key characters played by Amanda Root (Anne Elliot) and Ciaran Hind (Captain Wentworth) and a support cast of magnificent quality , the movie portrays the intricacies of the romance with superb maestry and the actress playing Anne (probably the most difficult character of Ms. Austen to play) makes a job so good that watching the movie we can see her inner conflicts and hopes, the despair and the happiness in her face almost without any words being said. Ciaran Hind is a magnificent Navy Captain and makes the perfect pair for Amanda Root. They are older than the other characters in the other books of Ms. Austen (Anne must be at least 27-28 years old and Captain Wentworth is certanly more than 30, almost 35 years old) but it must be mentioned that Persuasion was the last book of Ms. Austen. If you want to enjoy a extremely good romantic movie, faithful to the spirit of the book and with a superb cast, figurines and scenario, you will enjoy this adaptation very much. Is is priceless,a delicate jewel that follows  the spirit of Jane Austen's world with respect and even admiration. If you enjoyed Sense and Sensibility with Emma Thompson or Emma with Gwyneth Paltrow you will enjoy Persuasion very much. Highly recommended!",1303516800,,2817,4.600397614314115

751359,5,6303965415,"This ""Persuasion"" is the standard by which all other adaptations of britlit should be judged. Amanda Root is flawless as the faded and resigned Anne who has already accepted her fate as spinster aunt and put-upon companion to her uncaring family. Ciaran Hinds wonderfully brings to life Captain Wentworth who made his fortune during the Napoleonic sea battles and is now ready to settle down. They are both tragic victims of the standards of the time,  separated while in their early twenties by class consciousness and lack of money (his). But the Fates have destined that they meet again years later and despite the wounded pride of the Captain, and Anne's fragile feelings that threaten to overcome her at a moment's notice, they do find each other once more.

This is a movie about hidden passions: about Anne's repressed and fragile feelings, and about Frederick's channeled passions and wounded pride which have become duty to king and country.  Jane Austen's brilliance lay in using words to imply the bubbling cauldron of emotions beneath the surface of good manners and this movie shows these passions in a rapid glance, a trembling hand on a chair, a guarded comment. But beneath the happy story is the sadness we feel when we realize that fictional Anne is just one of thousands of real young women who had been destined to remain spinsters at home, burdens to be tolerated but not loved. Anne is lucky and we know it.

The mastery of this film (including its acting, costumes, lighting, direction, and even its slow pace) is seeing ghostly Anne change from a pale shadow that haunts her family home, wearing washed out colors, going through her days unloved and unwanted, to a young woman who literally wakes up to life and love, a bloom in her cheeks as she herself blossoms into the passionate woman she always has been under her sadness.

751367,3,6303965415,"Persuasion is a slow paced movie, not for those who typically like fast-action flicks. Very little actually happens during the story, but it is rather a character-driven movie about a man and woman reforging their past love for each other; a love that never really died.

The story begins eight years after Ann has rejected the marriage proposal of Frederick because she was advised that he was beneath her station and had no prospects. Then, during their eight-year separation, he gains a fortune on the high seas and Ann's family is near bankruptcy because of their pompous father's financial extravagance.

Both main characters never married. Ann (played wonderfully by Amanda Root) is considered a dispirited, sad ""old maid"" and Frederick (played by Ciaran Hinds) is considered an eligible bachelor by all the young ladies who try their hand to win him, since he is newly returned from the Napoleonic war and ready to take a wife.

The story is predictable, with no major surprises. It is gentile and fun, though, and I found myself intrigued toward the end, even though I nearly turned it off in the beginning because it was paced so slowly, showing people walking, horse-drawn carts and carriages, countryside and so forth. There was lots that I would have cut in order to get on with the story, but much of the pacing WAS the story. It's a different era with an emphasis on quiet conversation. People talk and talk, and they walk and talk, but the talk is often delightful in its common curtesy and politeness. Many modern young women could learn much from watching this movie.

Let this be a possible gage: if my review seems dull, then the movie may also seem dull because this review reflects the pace of Persuasion.

Both Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are very attractive and look like REAL people--not ""Hollywood Movie Stars"".  You can believe they were people Jane Austen knew personally.

The supporting cast is equally exceptional.  Sophie Thompson's portrayal of Mary Musgrove is spot on.  (I reread the book after watching this DVD again, and the scene when Anne goes to visit Mary at the beginning of the movie is almost word for word Jane Austen.)  And Corin Redgrave has captured the essence of Walter Elliot perfectly.

The film begins with a view of Admiral Croft being rowed out to his ship by the men of his crew, intercut with a view of Mr. Shepherd, Sir Walter Elliot's agent, on his way to Kellynch Hall with his daughter, Mrs. Clay, to discuss renting Kellynch Hall to Admiral Croft with Sir Walter.  Neither of these segments are in the novel, but cutting back and forth between them sets up the eventual meeting with Mr. Shepherd and Sir Walter when Sir Walter agrees to lease Kellynch Hall to Admiral Croft.  Great film making.  Another example.  At Lyme, in the foreground of the long shot of the Musgroves, Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth taking a walk along the sea wall is a table at which several women are at work cleaning fish.  Definitely not in the novel, but it's great cinema, because it sets up the long shot of the walk along the sea wall very nicely.  This is a beautiful film that you can watch repeatedly and see something new each time.",1288224000,3,1258,4.621621621621622

Amanda Root is okay,  but definitely needs some fine tuning for the big screen. For me personally, the unattractive actors detracted from the story.

Also, hard to detect any feelings or chemistry between the two main characters. Besides looking at each other occasionally, and Amanda's character looking like a deer in headlights almost the whole time...very annoying..there was no chemistry on screen between the two. No established chemistry = bad, dull movie.

Anyway, not worth buying as I did, rent it, because at least then you won't be stuck with it. Sorry to be so harsh, but there it is.",1285459200,13,759,4.8604651162790695
751434,2,6303965415,"Of all the movies based on Jane Austen's novels, this story seems somewhat frustrating in the slow plot.  There is the usual romance, set in 1814 England, and the cinematography, costumes and scenes are beautiful.  It is a story of Anne Elliot (Amanda Root) who is the spinster daughter of a aristocratic family having money issues.  The father has been widowed and spends far too much money, so the family have to rent the estate and move to smaller quarters.

It turns out Anne was once engaged to Frederic Wentworth, who was deemed too beneath her by family.  She had to break her engagement eight years prior.  He was a young sea captain at the time, but now, after eight years, he has made a fortune and become successful.  All the young ladies want his attention and company.  Due to the change in her family's fortune, Anne is thrown again into company of Frederic, and there are some indications that he is still  in love with her.  The movie has many facial close-ups and much of the acting is quiet emoting.  There is some humor and irony in the story, but it moves far too slowly and the plot is not that strong.  The period is captured and somewhat educational as it mentions Napoleon isolated on the isle of Elba and a war that is brewing.

Overall this is not as good as the other Jane Austen stories, plus the movie has a few audio problems in the first few scenes.  You can surmise what people are saying but many words are hard to hear.",1285286400,,1453,4.433962264150943

The dialogue was hard to follow because some of the actors swallowed their words. The actor portraying Anne's father is a case in point. Maybe if I were from England I would better understand him. I was tempted to use the close captioning at times.

I can't really classify this one as a romance because the actors left me cold. No romance there. I gave it one star, but it didn't even deserve that one. If this were my only experience with Jane Austen, I would be hard put to understand her reputation as a writer. She must be turning over in her grave.",1279929600,6,791,4.570422535211268

Still, these changes did not greatly bother me as an Austen fan and I accept them as an alteration the director (or whoever) made to convey the true nature of these vain characters. Amanda Root is a very likable, mild, discerning, real Ann, and Cirian Hines (or however his name is spelled) plays a strong, intelligent, fallible, delightful Captain Wentworth.

751582,5,6303965415,"In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to ""marry well"" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.

But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's ""Persuasion"" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. But the best movie adaptation wouldn't work without Amanda Root and Ciar&aacute;n Hinds.

Eight years ago, Anne Elliott (Root) was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth (Hinds), but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.

Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter (Corin Redgrave) is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.

And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.

""Persuasion"" is a very different story than Jane Austen's other novels, mainly because it was the last book she wrote before her early death -- it has an older heroine, admiration for the self-made man, and a sense of bittersweet resignation to lost chances and old loves. And the movie adaptation is very faithful to the original novel, and maintains the same mixture of romanticism and realism.

The only major problem with the movie is that it moves... very... slowly... throughout the first three-quarters of the movie. But it has Austen's subtle wit (""My offer to flatter and adore you all the days of your life."" ""I haven't had a moment to turn my mind to it"") and delicate romantic interplay, as well as some delicious harpooning of puffed-up aristocrats, social climbers and nasty relatives.

Root is absolutely brilliant as Anne -- she's not pretty, but her enormous liquid eyes give her a quietly striking quality that is much rarer than mere prettiness. And she does a great job with Anne's quiet despair at ever getting married, particularly to the one man she loved. And Hinds is equally amazing as Wentworth, a strong, intelligent man with a deep inner fire. The scene in which they finally come together in the street is staggeringly powerful... although the passing circus is kind of distracting.

The adaptation of Jane Austen's final novel is a polished, slow, slightly bittersweet love story about a second chance with the one you love. Be persuaded -- ""Persuasion"" is lovely.",1269561600,3,3033,5.003968253968254

751662,4,6303965415,"I had just finished reading this novel by Jane Austen on my Kindle, and remembered seeing this on PBS a couple of years ago. I only caught the tail end of it, but decided to buy this. As with the book which was written towards the end of Jane Austen's life, the movie portrayed an older and more somber young woman, with less of the sense of humor that filled her earlier books. Perhaps life had 'beaten' Austen down...she had not had the opportunity to marry, nor had her sister after her fiance had died overseas. Austen most probably died of breast cancer which may have been giving her problems by the time she was writing this book. Whatever the reason, this story lacked the joy of the earlier ones, and this movie was not the best portrayal of the book in comparison to the many other portrayals of the other books. It seemed very choppy and didn't tie all the information in together that the book did such as the fact that the protagonist's male cousin and the woman who befriended her sister and father were in cahoots.

Maybe in a few years, someone else in England will see fit to produce this story again...they seem to like to redo Austen's stories on a regular basis. I hope they do. This isn't a bad movie, just not accurate and in keeping with the book.",1264550400,,1270,4.404255319148936

It is clear from the outset that the folks behind this production took it seriously and worked diligently to bring to life the work of our dear Jane Austen. The casting is nearly perfect-I could insert my own tastes here-but that would not be of help in your decision making process. The bottom line is that that characters that are to be liked are likeable and those intended to offend do so quite well. The acting is superb-one almost feels like a fly on the wall in many scenes, they are so realistic and naturally acted! It is a bit fantastic that a spinster though is being sought after at some parts of the story by as many as three men at a time-but that is also what makes it so much fun. I wish I could offer a guarantee for your enjoyment if you are of a ""persuasion"" to enjoy Regency romance in the vein of the late Great Jane.",1249084800,,953,4.2707182320441985
751757,4,6303965415,"There are over 400 Amazon reviews for this movie!  More than 400 people have had opinions to express, which should make anyone interested in seeing it for that reason alone.  I'll put my two cents' worth in as well.

As with any production of an Austen (or any other) book, a film is a re-telling.  The same story (presumably) is being told by a different storyteller.  That automatically makes for some differences.

That being said, I truly enjoy this movie.  I love the book, and this production is true to the original story in most respects - something important to me.  The cinematography is excellent; it would be a joy to look at even if one did not care for anything else.  I really enjoy the score as well.

The acting is quite good.  Many writers have commented on the characterizations; some of them are not what I would have preferred, but none are too far afield from the author's descriptions (for example, Elizabeth is described by the author as ""repulsive,"" although I might not have built a characterization solely on that word).  The intent of the production was obviously that the actors should not be ""pretty"" but as much like ""real folks"" as possible, for better or for worse.  That, too, is all right, although one may not like it as much seeing them larger than life.

To me, the major flaw in this retelling is where it deviates from the original.  Perhaps for reasons of uncomplicating the story (and/or for time considerations), the character of Mrs. Smith was changed from a desperate woman misused by Mr. Elliot to a mere featherbrained, gossipy friend; the plot line was changed so that Mr. Elliot now wants to marry Anne for her money.  This simply does not make sense; Mr. Elliot would not have wanted Anne for her money because he knew her father had spent practically all of it already.  The writers dropped the ball with a thud in this respect, and it's difficult for such a gaffe to be overlooked or excused by anyone familiar with the book.

But would I recommend this film?  Yes.  Those who are put off by early-19th-century English - who can't plow through all the now-strange words and idioms - get their best introduction to Jane Austen's works through quality productions such as this one.  If you've never read ""Persuasion,"" give it a try after seeing this.",1245542400,,2300,4.6575682382134

There once was a boy
and once was a girl
Do Jane's books repeat plots so obvious?

His first attempt sunk
Did not go his way
'cause Lady Russel had her say

They didn't want him
He wasn't a swell
that he'd later be rich
who could tell?

Now Elliots retrench
seek a new abode
Mr and  'lizabeth and Clay
to Bath go

He was a sailor boy
she said see ya later boy
he wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face
but her bloom has been displaced
Can he see that she still has worth?

8 years ago
he left her at home
sailed off on his ship
yes, all alone

The Asp it was named
it sunk in the sea
But the captain escaped fatality

He called on Mary
said he barely did know
Anne because she had altered so

On walks Anne tagged along
just one of the crowd
But then he noticed she'd slowed down

He was a sailor boy
she said see ya later boy
he wasn't good enough for her
But she has her regrets
and he's being considerate
Could she mean something to Wentworth?

He was a sailor boy
she said see ya later boy
he wasn't good enough for her
Now maybe she has a chance
but is there a new romance
Will she lose to a younger one by birth?

Sorry Anne thinks she missed out
Is he Louisa Musgrove's now?
Are they in love or just good friends?
We know how the story ends

Too bad the movie on TV
skipped the parts that were meant to be
or if the actors could have tried
speaking louder from inside

There once was a boy
and once was a girl
together now -- isn't it obvious?

They are in love
Tho' haven't you heard
him saying no woman on board ever?

She's with the sailor boy
singing an ode to Joy
Lets the past regrets all go
Now she's on his ship afloat
after the note he wrote
to the girl he used to know

She's with the sailor boy
signing off ""Ships Ahoy""
And all 'round the world they go
no one can now persuade
them to have it any other way
A fitting end to the whole show

751944,5,6303965415,"Amazon reviewers in noticeably large numbers are wholly in the right for lavishly praising this BBC version of Jane Austen's final novel. Of the spate of Austen adaptations released in the past two decades, it's arguable that this particular one is the finest. First of all, it takes striking advantage of TV's being so good a medium for the adaptation of manners novels. Pretty much void of grand vistas, this version focuses on expressive close-ups, raised eyebrows, revelatory tete-a-tetes, and the tinkle of teacups. Amanda Root is wonderfully adept at showing us the painful consequences of Anne Elliot's refusal of Captain Wentworth years earlier. Her face in the early scenes is one with an appropriately faded bloom, and her unhappiness is signaled through her nervous, furtive glances and the almost cringing manner in which she enters rooms. She is the consummate solitary heroine of this potentially tragic, mature Austen novel. At home, she experiences what has been called the tyranny of neglect, being regularly passed over or unexpectedly offered to others for ""use"" by her self-absorbed father and older sister. The tinkle of teacups in these family scenes reveals to the shrewd observer that some of the hands holding the cups might as well have been claws and the noses snouts. Jane Austen clearly in this film is revealed as a specialist both in domestic humor and domestic horror. With the exception of Anne herself, the other Elliots inadvertently illustrate the truth in G.B.Shaw's witty paradox that ""the human family is the greatest instrument of torture the race has so far devised.""

The Lyme scenes of the story are especially well-handled. A combination of the fresh sea air and a growing restoration in the returned Wentworth's good opinion combine to change Amanda Root's face to one of bright-eyed hope ""after all hope has been lost."" Also, the encounters here between Anne and the heartbroken Captain Benwick have been successfully dramatized and are moving in their rich irony. Having lost his beloved Phoebe, but ignorant of Anne's own lost love, Benwick tells Anne she cannot understand what he has lost. She responds beautifully and powerfully with the quiet rejoinder, ""Oh, but I can.""

If the film has any flaws, I would say they lie in the denouement which is truncated and rather abrupt and in the characterization of Sir Walter and his oldest daughter Elizabeth. These two Elliots are too monotonously drawn in their repetitive self-absorbtion, the father caring only for looks and the daughter for rank. On the other hand, Mary, the hypochondriac Elliot middle sister, played with great skill by Sophie Thompson, is a wholly successful characterization, being more than one-dimensional in her awfulness and thus more unwittingly comical - she's a snob and doting mother as well as a hypochondriac.

Root's performance matches the ever-excellent Ciaran Hinds, and that's not an easy task; I had a hard time watching Hinds' ""Jane Eyre"" (opposite Samantha Morton's Jane) because they didn't seem well matched to me.

751987,5,6303965415,Persuasion is a wonderful story.  Who hasn't wanted to go back and rekindle a romance that was prematurely cut short by the wrong advice of friends?  This is an excellent verion of Persuasion.  The actors are well cast and very likeable.  Your heart breaks for Anne who listened to bad advice and did not make her own choice in love and marry Wentworth the first time he proposed.  It just shows you that you cannot take advice that is so contrary to what your heart and mind tells you - even from family.  It is a charming story that pulls you in as the acting is very well done and the story line is well adapted to this film version.  It is a very charming story to watch.,1218153600,3,675,4.2265625
751988,5,6303965415,"I bought this version of ""Persuasion"" because of A. Casalino's glowing review and am very glad I did. I also have the Masterpiece Theatre version as well and like it too, but this film is a must for anyone who loves Jane Austen, her novels, and her unforgettable, vibrant characters. Amanda Root epitomizes Anne Elliot in every way: appearance, way of speaking, facial expressions, humility, even in her walk. Buying this DVD just for Root's Anne Elliot is well worth the money; however, Ciaran Hinds' performance as Wentworth is right up there too. Kudos  to the actress who portrays his sister, Mrs. Sophy Crofts, and to the actor who plays husband, Admiral Croft. It is as though Austen's characters have stepped right out of the novel and onto the screen. For example, Colin Redgrave's turn as Sir Walter Elliot is priceless! His flagrant self-absorption, narcissism, and puffed-up ego are most amusing at first and inevitably direct the viewer's thoughts to the origins and continuation of Anne's self-effacement.

And the final scenes between Anne and Wentworth - magnificently done!",1217894400,4,1089,5.112359550561798

I love the novel and the story came alive for me as I watched this movie - perfection in every scene.  The actors fit their characters so exquisitely that I could not imagine anyone else playing the roles, and certainly there are none that could come close to Amanda Root and Ciaran Hand playing the leads.  Their respective transformations from rundown to radiant, and aloof to passionate were subtle and spot on, and completely matched my personification of the characters as I read the book.  I watch the final scenes every time I need a romantic ""high"" - Wentworth realizing Anne still loves him has he hears her say that women love the longest when there is no hope, and Anne reading his amazing letter that brings her total joy then madly trying to be alone with him to say ""yes"".

751991,5,6303965415,"The producers of this film took their jobs seriously.  By that, I mean that I think they actually read the book before producing the film. And the production is so much better for it.

The story is classic and familiar:  Boy and girl fall in love.  The girl (who is young and easily manipulated) is convinced to drop the boy since he is not ""acceptable"" -- not of her caste.  Later, after many changes in fortune, they meet again, but this time it is the man who is initially reluctant to form any kind of alliance with her, though she still cares deeply for him.  It takes some shared experiences, a change of scenery, and some realization on both of their parts of their mutual responsibilities before they are happily joined together.

Sounds like the making of a soap opera, doesn't it?  But in the hands of Jane Austin's incomparable skill at story telling coupled with excellent casting of the film, a fine adaptation of the story, and just a smidge of Aristotle's ""willing suspension of disbelief,"" this film is a wonderful fresh surprise.

By the way, if you saw the recent PBS Masterpiece Classics adaptation of this same book, you may find as I did that it suffered greatly when compared to this earlier production.

Amanda Root was just so perfect for the role. Anytime I read Persausion, I see her as Anne Elliot. As Anne changes before the viewer's eyes, Root changes somehow that is noticeable to the audience and makes it seem flawless and real. Ciaran Hinds as Wentworth cannot be matched either. The two acted very well together and did the Austen classic justice. The supporting cast also portrayed the supporting charcters true to the book.

Also, it is not exactly like the book, a good reproduction, but not the same page for page. That shouldn't turn you off of the movie though. Nothing is ever as good as the original, but this movie does a decent job trying. Finally, don't expect twenty-somethings acting in this movie.

752147,5,6303965415,"In my opinion, this film is the very best version of film adaptations of Jane Austen's PERSUASION.  The casting seems perfect and the subtle physical transformation of Amanda Root (Anne Elliot) is incredible.  Having recently seen the new PBS/Masterpiece Theater version (didn't like the casting on that one), I think that the only place that it excelled over this version was in making the relationship between Mrs. Clay and cousin Elliot clearer--that the cousin wanted not only to marry Anne so he could inherit the estate, but to also have Mrs. Clay as his mistress on the side to prevent her from marrying Sir Walter Elliot and possibly producing a male heir to beat him out of the property.  That flaw was probably due to some footage ending up on the cutting room floor.  Overall, however, this earlier version is vastly superior and may be my favorite adaptation of all the Austen novels to date.",1205798400,2,904,4.812903225806451
752148,5,6303965415,"Let me state up front that I have never read Jane Austen's novels but I've watched almost every version of her novels put to film. I was confused in places when I watched for the first time this 1995 version of Persuasion with Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root, but a second viewing clarified -- and I've watched and loved it many times since (however, I've mused that this version would have been even better had Andrew Davies written the screenplay). I love to watch the subtle play of emotions on the characters' faces, which reveal the thoughts and feelings people of that era would never utter aloud. I was so looking forward to watching Rupert Penry Jones' Captain Wentworth in the new rendition of Persuasion because I loved him in his small but memorable role in the excellent film, Charlotte Gray. But I was disappointed in the entire production, especially in the casting of plain Sally Hawkins. I would never for a moment believe that Penry Jones would be attracted to, never mind pine for, her. I was also disappointed in Penry Jones' rather wooden performance (though I think he had the deck stacked against him by the screenplay and the way that film was shot). I found the final scene of Hawkins running through the streets ridiculous and her way-too-long-lead-up-to-a-kiss with Wentworth contrived. What most disturbed me about the new film and the other new film versions of the Austen novels released this season (Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey, although I thought Northanger Abbey the best of the three; I haven't seen Sense and Sensibility or Emma yet) is that everything feels forced -- the action is too fast and ""choppy."" Sally Hawkins is plopped onto the back of the carriage like a sack of potatoes, versus the subtle caress of Ciaran Hinds' hands on Amanda Root's waist as he helps her into the carriage, followed by the embarrassed expression on her face as she looks back at him and as he turns away to hide the caring his action revealed. Time and time again in this 1995 version, you can see the subtle emotions on the characters' faces because the camera lingers appropriately. This is only one of countless moments of genuine feeling that is totally lacking in the new version. Is it that we're losing in our increasingly fast-paced results-oriented world -- reflected in many current films -- the ability to let life and feeling unfold according to its own natural rhythms? I was not persuaded that the characters in the new version were real at all. Thank goodness I have my wonderful 1995 version to watch again and again.",1205625600,2,2557,4.774266365688487

The sequence of events is such that the characters' motivations are better explained. The cast is fabulous and truly capture the spirit of the book. Root's portrayal of Anne is subtle and sensitive, perceptive and mature. We see her bloom on the screen. The special connection between Anne and Cap'n Wentworth is palpable. I love that Wentworth is always in uniform and the scene in Lyme, strolling on the jetty is one of the most memorable in the movie.

Austen's sense of humor is preserved and delightfully portrayed.

Watch as Anne Eliot blooms when placed in social situations where her true nature is revealed. See Captain Wentworth transform from an unpardoning jilted lover to a man captivated by the love he still feels in his heart.

  while the pride and prejudice was lovely and beautiful, i completely swooned over persuasion.
  true that the actors aren't overly attractive.  but as the film goes on, hinds becomes handsome and desirable because we see him through Anne's eyes.  Anne, who is plain and not overly attractive, goes through the same metamorphosis.
 the acting is subtle, measured, deliberate.  we ache, yearn,and love with these characters.  it speaks to the love of that we have lost, that we have given up on, resigned to being alone...  it is a modern fairy tale, a love story for grown ups.
  the film is beautiful in scenery, music, everything. i never tire of watching it.  it remains my favorite  jane austen i have seen yet,though the new pride and prejudice with keira knightly, the non masterpiece theatre mansfield park are very very closely behind this film.

Nothing in this film is over dramatized like that in typical American movies. I guess I would have to give much credit to the producers, editors and others involved in the making of this film.

I have to admit that when I first watched this film, I was completely  bored.  I guess I was so condition to expect extraordinary amounts of action packed drama.  My problem still remains with most romantic films.  At the point that the characters are able to connect and share each others love, that is when the story ends.  Very, Very disappointing.  I would have given this film 4 stars for the very reason that the romantic part is far outweighed by the facets of suspense and contention leading up to the much-too-brief romantic end, but with this story, something else would have been left out.  My recommendation to this problem is for the filmakers to produce sequels to these films such as Pursuasion 2 or a more romantic title - where people can see the happily-ever-after portion of the story.

I just accept that I often feel like Anne Elliot, and have been often treated like her by family members (""Ask Anne for advice?  Why?"").  It's also the most profound of her books, with themes of lost love and disappointment mixed in with the haunting images of Lyme.  This movie (a superb DVD transfer) simply astonishes on every level.  The acting is superb down to the smallest role (Mrs. Smith's nurse is a hoot!).  Amanda Root captures Anne's intelligence and lost bloom without ever begging our sympathy; she's too accomplished and intelligent a creature to enlist simple bathos.  Her transformation is so subtle, from sad soon-to-be spinster to woman in love, and yet so complete that she literally seems to come alive right before our eyes.  Ciaran Hinds is a very likeable Captain Wentworth, a true man's man but with enough sensitivity to love his male friends and not shrink from saying so--a true sign of masculine strength and security.  Sir Walter is a vain, abrasive fellow, but in the hands of Corin Redgrave remains watchable and funny; Fiona Shaw is a marvel in her few scenes as Sophie Croft, Wentworth's sister, and it's always a treat to see Judy Cornwell away from the low class frump she played so well on ""Keeping Up Appearances"".  Great, spare music and gorgeous cinematography complement director Roger Michell's sure hand--he never steps wrong in this splendid adaptation.

Amanda Root, as our heroine, Anne, is the only adult child to have taken after her deceased  mother, and the other two sisters are Austen's 'fluff'. Their father, played by Corin Redgrave, is a thoughtless fop. Ciaran Hinds [most recently seen as Julius Caesar in HBO's ""ROME""] plays the young and handsome naval Capt. Wentworth, as the object of Anne's affection, which she believes to be lost forever. These two leading actors are without peer. Their subtlety and the simple looks that occur are so touching and sweet. I had seen this production at least three times on television, so was excited to have my own copy.

Spoilery - Ciarin Hind's Captain Wentworths' look over a wineglass, his controlled but pained look after touching her when helping her down off the carriage and then his look when dropping off the letter, screamed that he still loved her!  I think Jane Austen would be proud to have this in her movie viewing collection.",1202947200,,603,4.930693069306931
752190,4,6303965415,"1995's ""Persuasion"" is a very solid dramatization of Jane Austen's last completed novel.  The movie opens with the abdication of French Emperor Napoleon in 1814.  The British Navy, long at sea, is ""paid off"", releasing its officers to find homes ashore.  An Admiral Croft rents the mansion of Sir Walter Elliot, a foppish baronet on the verge of bankruptcy.  Sir Walter moves his family to Bath, leaving behind his practical but much-put-upon daughter Anne to close out the house.  She will learn that Admiral Croft's brother in law is Captain Frederick Wentworth, once Anne's suitor, whom she was persuaded to reject on the grounds that he lacked money and status.  Anne is older now, still unmarried, and regretting her choice.

Anne will visit with her sister before moving on to Bath. There, she will suffer through the awkwardness of meeting Wentworth again and of watching him pay court to two younger and prettier relatives.  An accident to one of them will force Anne to take charge, making a renewed impression on Wentworth.

In Bath with her family, Anne will make a series of boring social rounds, only to have a long-missing Eliot cousin suddenly pay court to her.  This attention comes as Wentworth follows Anne to Bath; setting up a very interesting and very Jane Austen ending.  Director Roger Mitchell turns this love story into high suspense, investing each glance between Anne and Wentworth with emotional significance.  Jane Austen fans should not be disappointed; highly recommended.",1202860800,,1503,5.065040650406504
752191,5,6303965415,"Wanting to use a film adaptation of Austen's novel in a college literature course, I had several choices, including a more recent PBS adaptation. This version (with Amanda Root)seems much more accurate to me--the scene between Capt Harwick and Anne wherein they debate men's vs women's fidelity and ways of loving remains towards the end with Wentworth overhearing it (whereas in the recent PBS version the conversation occurs between Benwick and Anne in Lyme). Also, Root portrays Anne Elliot as a more mature and maturing woman, yet one who reveals strong emotions (her surprise at encountering WEntworth, for instance)with a great deal of subtlety and dignity (unlike the PBS version which has Anne Elliott running up and down the streets of Bath, unescorted, breathlessly searching for Wentworth). Finally, this version (the one with Amanda Root)incorporates lavish cultural detail--candelabras attached to music stands, for instance, to remind the viewer that all was not (fluorescently) illuminated during the Regency era.",1202428800,5,1028,5.512658227848101
752192,2,6303965415,"The first time I saw this film I really struggled to follow all the characters. So, I watched it a second time. The beginning seems dark, and poor Anne is depicted as so meek and lonely with her sisters such jerks. Of course, her sisters were jerks. I really did not like the casting of Frederick Wentworth at all. He seemed too old and too weathered to play any sort of romantic lead. I just could not get into the romance between Anne and Frederick.  So, I read the book because a friend told me it was such a wonderful story. I enjoyed the book, so decided to watch this film again. But, alas, it still seems too gloomy and not very romantic at all. I am surprised that so many enjoyed this version.",1201737600,7,702,4.2388059701492535
752193,5,6303965415,"Like many of the other reviewers here, I too found this to be a film which disappointed a trifle at first, but which grew in richness and texture with every subsequent viewing. (and I would estimate that I have watched it perhaps thirty times, so I know whereof I speak!)
 What makes this film so special is the excellence of the ensemble cast, all of whom were uniformly excellent. Sophie Thompson as Mary Musgrove is a gem, as are the wonderful portrayals of Sir Walter Elliott's comically foppish self absorption, Anne Elliott's spoiled disdainfulness, and Lady Russell's well meaning but snobbish preoccupation with rank.
 Lesser characters are equally charming, most notable among these Mrs. Croft's radiant portrayal of a wife quietly but madly in love with her husband. Her glow at the dinner table when she describes her shipboard adventures to Anne is palpable and warmly engaging. Charles Musgrove is also portrayed flawlessly, as are both of his parents.
 On of the most quietly amusing scenes in the film is when Anne and Mary visit the Musgroves at their estate just after Anne's arrival in Uppercross. Each member of the family corners Anne with a politely worded complaint about her sister Mary's behavior, while Mary in turn counters each with a conflicting complaint of her own. At the end of this little set piece, we see Anne and Charles sitting side by side. Charles sighs and says wryly ""oh Anne!"" and Anne gives a small but eloquent sigh, and nods in silent empathy. Masterful.
 But by far the greatest credit must go to Amanda Root, for her absolutely amazing portrayal of a woman who has 'lost her bloom' to the numbness of loss, loneliness, and regret. It's perfectly true that her looks are not that of which Hollywood leading ladies are made, and this is what makes her portrayal so moving. In the beginning scenes she is downright plain, but as the film progresses, the tentative stirrings of hope within her radiate to the surface, turning her from the stoically homely woman we see in the cart to Uppercross to the quietly elegant and lovely woman who holds her own in a sophisticated conversation with Mr. Elliott in a Bath drawing room.
 But the most amazing scene, which I never tire of, and which I was surprised that no one else mentioned in these reviews, takes place at Uppercross cottage, the first time the Admiral and Mrs. Croft come to call. While the Admiral is busy with the Musgrove boys, Mrs. Croft sets about making small talk with Ann. ""It was you and not your sister, I find, who was acquainted with my brother"" she says, and we see Anne's eyes widen in shock at her words. When Mrs. Croft adds that her brother is married, Ann's expression seems to freeze into a kind of unspoken dismay, but she manages to stammer out her best wishes. Mrs. Croft's next words make it clear that it is her other brother, the curate, of whom she speaks, and we see Ann draw in a breath of surprise, then let it out again in a tiny rush of relief that is all the more intense for being almost imperceptible.
 It is an amazing one-two-three-four sequence of shifting reaction and response, all conveyed totally through Ms. Roots eyes and facial expression, without one word being spoken. I wonder if the reason no one mentioned it here, despite uniform praise for Ms. Root's acting, is that it was so subtle that no one even focused on it? If not, go back and watch this scene again. Once you realize what you are seeing, you will never overlook it again--it is a tiny little marvel hidden in a film which is full of such moments.
 All in all, my only complaint about this film is that there isn't enough of it. Someone mentioned in these reviews that the editing process eliminated 30-45 minutes of footage, and that is truly too bad. I could wish that some of these deleted scenes could be restored, most notably towards the end of the film. Something to clarify Mr. Elliot's motivation  in wanting to attach Anne, and also make clearer his connection to Mrs. Clay would have been helpful in tying up what seemed like a bit of a loose end.
 Also, I would like to have seen something a little more conclusive added to the ending of the film. The shipboard scene of Anne and her husband sailing off into the sunset was lovely in theory, but it came so abruptly that the rhythm seemed slightly off key, like a song that's waiting for one last note to end it on a decisive downbeat.
 But those are minor complaints--overall, this film is sheer, quiet poetry.",1201651200,4,4485,4.623115577889447

This version of Persuasion is still the best. Amanda Root does a wonderful job of going from someone that everyone ignores (but really desperately needs), to a woman who realizes her mistake at being ""persuaded"" to turn Capt Wentworth down 8 years earlier, to someone who makes amends. It takes just about the entire length of the movie for Amanda to speak up, but in the end she does.  Alas true love never goes away...

The cast is impressive, Amanda Root, Ciaran Hinds, Corin Redgrave, Phoebe Nicolls, Sam West, Sophie Thompson, Judy Cornwell, the late Susan Fleetwood to name a few, all fine actors and actresses.

The acting is very true-to-life and I found it to be a fantastic character study.  Not everyone in the world is strikingly beautiful, and that's why this show is so realistic.  I am reminded when I watch this show how important a true and noble character is - more important than good looks.  Also - there are so many subtleties in the acting that make this film great.  The acting and dialogue are superb.  When I watch it I feel like I'm there in the time period, listening in on conversations, seeing nuances on the faces of the characters that let me know how they feel and what they must be thinking.

752233,4,6303965415,"PERSUASION together with NORTHANGER ABBEY were posthumous novels by Jane Austin (published 1817) and reflect the position of a novelist whose thoughts mirror her younger, wonderful bright spirit yet somehow her softer social and feminist darts she so successfully hurled at society in her other famous works.  This particular film adaptation by Nick Dear of PERSUASION respects not only the spirit of the novel but also the station of the author.  Under Roger Mitchell's keen direction this cinematic reenactment of the belated flowering of a Anne Elliot's eight year thwarted longing for the love of naval officer Frederick Wentworth, all due to the 'impropriety' of Wentworth's financial standings of the past, is placed before us as a quietly gentle song, one that still places the scrutinizing Austen microscope on the social mores of the time and the bows to class distinctions that serve as the matrix for Austen's novels.

The cast is excellent, with Amanda Root suitably in the background as Anne Elliot and Ciarn Hinds as the wise and slightly weathered Captain Wentworth.  But their superb performances would not be as credible were it not for the large cast of fine actors playing the superficial silly sisters and cousins and the haughty ladies as well as the warm and worthy ones.  This is first rate ensemble acting, allowing the quiet pulse of Austen's Anne to beat softly behind longing eyes, making her plight and ultimate reward for perseverance step stage front at the end of the film.  The music of Chopin and Bach flavor the score by Jeremy Sams and the presence of Rosa Mannion, soprano, singing arias and songs lends both an aural and visual credibility to the atmosphere so ably captured by cinematographer John Daly.  This is a satisfying Jane Austen adaptation.  Grady Harp, January 08",1200787200,14,1811,5.033444816053512

Amanda Root is an absolutely picture perfect Anne. Her transformation from the downtrodden, but dignified and intelligent, daughter of a foolish lord into a hopeful and luminous woman in love is astounding to behold. And Ciaran Hinds is a rugged and masculine Captain Wentworth; portraying with masterful subtlety the Captain's determined but futile attempts to deny his feelings for Anne. The supporting characters in the story are also extremely good.

Ciaran Hinds is handsome, hard-hearted,  dashing and tender as Frederick Wentworth.  All of the supporting players are a delight.  Sophie Thompson and Phoebe Nicholls are  Anne's insufferable snobbish sisters, Simon Russell Beale is comical as Anne's long-suffering, clueless brother-in-law,  Corin Redgrave is hilariously narcissistic and pompous and Fiona Shaw plays Mrs Croft with easy elegance.  Also love the way the film looks,  not so highly polished as ""Sense and Sensibility"" or ""Emma"" , as though there was a lot less money to work with and the happy result is that the audience gets a truer picture of a certain kind  of early 19th century life in England.

There were things one simply did not speak aloud; decorum and restraint were the rule. I felt the actors rose extremely well to the challenge: their gestures, expressions, and tone conveyed effectively the meanings the characters couldn't say outright, given their time and place.

A particular treat was seeing how the dialogue allowed both Anne and Captain Wentworth communicate their feelings ""between the lines"": Captain Wentworth speaking of Captain Benwick and Phoebe, says, ""A man does not recover from such a devotion to such a woman..."" and *clearly* he wants Anne to understand that he is describing his own feelings for her.

Anne  Elliot and Frederick Wentworth's romance came to a sudden halt in 1806. Anne, the daughter of a conceited and spendthrift baronet, loved Wentworth but was advised by her family's confidant, Lady Russell, that the match was inappropriate, as Wentworth had no connections or money. Now 8 years later, because of her father's excessive financial debts, Anne's family is forced to retrench, and sublet their estate. The family retreats to Bath, where, to the delight of Anne's father, they can maintain their privileged lifestyle on a much smaller budget. The family's home, Kellynch Hall, is to be let by an Admiral and his wife, who, coincidentally, are related to Wentworth. This liaison throws Anne back into the society of Wentworth, now a dashing Captain in the Royal Navy who has amassed quite a fortune in privateering. The Captain has caught the attention of Louisa Musgrove, whose brother married Anne's sister, Mary. Meanwhile Anne, now in her late 20's and showing signs of physical and emotional stress, is surprisingly courted by Mr. Elliot, heir to her father's estate, Kellynch Hall. The question remains as to whether Mr. Elliot's romantic intentions towards Anne are sincere, and whether she can bare the thought of her lost love, Captain Wentworth, marrying Miss Louisa.

There is truly nothing that can compare to a Jane Austen romance. Her style is timeless; her plotting masterful. The characters in her books are so well-developed that they have become somewhat immortal. Fans of period pieces will NOT be disappointed. This one is not to be missed.

752406,5,6303965415,"This less-than-2-hour movie aired on PBS with a great intro by host Russell Baker.  The dvd is a good rendering but sound could be better.

Anne is the younger, unappreciated daughter of a shallow aristocrat who has squandered his money and has to move to Bath in order to live cheaply.  The story revolves around this situation and his daughters' love interests, as well as the famous trip to Lyme.

Anne's old love, Captain Wentworth, proposed to her years ago, but she refused him on advice of a close family friend who thought he was too poor.  Now the shoe is on the other foot.  He reappears, wealthy and sought after, seeming to have forgotten Anne.  He leads everyone to believe he plans to marry Anne's sister-in-law.

In the 8 years since refusing him, Anne has become strong enough to go after what she wants, but her family and a new man on the scene make that difficult.  The last few minutes of the film are some of the most romantic ever made.

Warning:  don't watch this with anyone who would laugh at the Austen-era language. It will ruin the experience for you.",1182384000,3,1079,4.538860103626943
752407,3,6303965415,"Glad I read the book before watching the film. There were scenes from the book that could have been included to make the film story line flow better. The actors/actresses were not as believable and didn't seem to fit the descriptions in the book as well. This adaptation of ""Persuasion"" was not as good as Ang Lee's ""Sense and Sensibility"" (with Emma Thompson) nor Andrew Davies' ""Pride and Prejudice"" (with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle).

752480,4,6303965415,I am a big Austin fan and have seen just about all of her movie adaptatons.  At first I found this movie slow and pointless but about 1/2 way through I got excited to see how it would end.  The ending makes good sense but could have been more detailed.  The movie builds up antisipation and then ends ubruptly and leaves you saying what just happened.  All and all this movie is worth seeing if you enjoy other  Austin movies.,1178236800,5,426,4.275
752481,5,6303965415,This is one of my favorite movies.  I saw it at the theater when it first came out and then I bought the book.  The characters seem like real people that a person could meet.,1177459200,6,174,3.942857142857143
752482,5,6303965415,"This is one of the best of this genre, literary adaptations.  Highly recommended, great cast especially Amada Root.",1176854400,5,115,5.388888888888889
752483,3,6303965415,"I am sorry to say that I was slightly disappointed with this adaptation of one of my best Jane Austen's novels. I heard so much praise of it so I was really excited to see it. But we all have different sensibilities and for me, the adaptation didn't manage to reproduce Anne's inner world and the depth of the love between Anne and Wentworth.

For me, the beauty of the book relies on the tension between Anne and Wentworth and on the looks that they can't help exchanging despite their long time of separation and despite Wentworth's resentment. Eight years ago, although Anne fell deeply in love with Wentworth, she was persuaded by her father and her deceased mother's friend to refuse his proposal, on account of Anne being too young and of Wentworth's lack of fortune. The story starts when Captain Wentworth returns to the country from the war with the intention of living peacefully and of finding a wife. They are to meet again unexpectedly as Anne's father, Sir Walter, is a heavy spender and the family has to let the family house, Kellynch Hall, to the Crofts who are closely related to Wentworth.

This love-story is really wonderful as it is all about undying love and about meeting again the person that you fell in love with so many years ago and in the case of Wentworth, meeting the woman you loved but broke your heart by rejecting you...These questions are still relevant today and that is what makes this story so original. Not only, Austen manages to create an incredible tension between Wentworth and Anne but also to describe to the perfection Anne's feelings of sadness, of solitude, of regret, of distress at seeing Wentworth for the first time.

But somehow, I didn't see any of that tension in the BBC film or Anne's real suffering. I am sorry to say so but I was not convinced by Amanda Root's performance as Anne Elliot. And it is not merely because she seems a little too old for the part, it is just that her face didn't display any emotion. I am probably shallow, but I need to see on the actress's face that Anne is very much affected by Wentworth's return. Unfortunately, I didn't feel any connections to this Anne. I really couldn't relate to her. I was not overwhelmed by the adaptation. I just watched it but I didn't feel the incredible urge to watch it again as I have felt for other period dramas like BBC North&South or BBC Pride &Prejudice.

However, I put three stars because I thought that Ciaran Hinds was rather good in the part of Wentworth and I liked the settings for the film. I have watched the 1995 version only once and I will try to make the effort and watch it once more. But I've seen the 2007 ITV adaptation and in my heart, this one has already met my expectations. Even though it is not as faithful to the book as the 1995 one and despite the poor performances of some actors, the 2007 version has blown me away, simply because Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones are perfect in the parts of Anne Elliot and of Captain Wentworth!!!

 This BBC version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds is not a bad film in itself. But it is just not 'my' adaptation of the book. Just see it for yourself and maybe you will be 'persuaded' by it.",1175904000,8,3187,4.4862068965517246
752484,3,6303965415,"I watched this moving about 11:00 at night, and I could barely keep my eyes open. The lead character started off dry and boring. Her personality started to come through towards the end, but it never quite moved me like

""Pride and Prejudice""(the mini-series/ Knightly) It seemed like a forced romance. I never really saw the sparks. I think I'll read the book to capture Jane Austens true intent...because this could not have been it!!",1175817600,3,435,4.8
752485,2,6303965415,"This version is much better than the 2008 version. I am a guy who likes period films such as ""Pride and Prejudice"", but this is a Chick-Flick that only women can understand. So women may not like my review.

A film that many women, with fancifulness, make enjoyable.

Pretty scenery, such as walks along the ocean. The costumes are often exceptional. There is wonderful singing in one scene and over the closing credits.

Men will find the characters, including Anne & the Captain, display wooden acting, often poker-faces. Others speak at a clipped pace. The properness of the times allowed for personality, as shown well in ""Pride & Prejudice"" 1940, 1996 & 2006, but not here. Shyness, plainness, or slowness, may be portrayed likeably, with some personality; but not here.

Both Anne & the Captain maintain wide-eyed, desperate, looks, constantly. Many of us do get nervous within romance; but we are compelled, by conversation and activity, to interrupt our nervousness with personality. Thus, Anne's & the Captain's constant, wide-eyed, nervousness is un-natural. All of us at the age of Anne and the Captain, would have refined our nervousness, clearly showing: shyness, or thought, or distance, or hopefulness, or approval, or alarm.

You understand the quiet thoughts, because of the story, in spite of the confusing, paralyzed, looks; rather than because of them. You come to like Anne and the Captain toward the end, in spite of the wooden acting, because of the story.

Another reviewer refers to important background from the book that is not in the film; thus a poor script for those who have not read the book. Good period, romance films are so few, and so desired, that many women, who have read the book, work and imagine an enjoyable film; better than it really is. I applaud their positive imaginations. However, they could not help but continue their imaginative thoughts into rating the poor directing of this film.

I would like to see this good story idea re-made by a better director.

Well-made romance films are: ""Pride & Prejudice 1940, 1996, 2006"", ""Wives & Daughters"", ""North & South"", and ""Naughty Marietta 1935 with Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy"". Fairly made is ""Under the Greenwood Tree"".",1175731200,4,2225,5.010840108401084
752486,5,6303965415,"This is the most beautiful and respectful of all Jane Austen's adaptations.

The acting is brilliant. Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds show the subtle intensity and restrained passion that finally errupts quietly and meaningfully to none but them. To think that it was written at a time when Jane Austen was suffering the unbearable syptoms of cancer and to have written such a positive story! Sometimes I think she (the author) placed in this her final novel all she wished her life to have been. Jane was Anne. I cannot think she would have found it possible to have written this story any other way. Anyone who has read the novel knows the director has made all the right choices to be true to the story, from the art direction, to the the settings to the music. The director had a clear vision and knew exactly how he wanted the audience to ""feel"" this film. Such honesty and respect to a literary work is seldom, if ever seen.

The story of a long-simmering love that was lost and ultimately found again is told in such a subtle manner as to tug at one's heartstrings, and draw us into the enduring love story between Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth. The two leads are impeccable in their performances...Amanda Root plays a lovelorn Anne who tries to 'speak' her true feelings in gestures rather than words, and Ciaran Hinds makes a dashing Captain Wentworth, who still smarting from Anne's rejection of his proposal years ago, nevertheless still loves her. The rest of the cast do an equally amazing job of playing out their respective parts, and the scenes of the English countryside, and the coastal city of Bath are purely enchanting.

Is Persuasion her finest novel? Could be but then there is Emma,  Pride an Prejudice and Mansfield Park as well as her amazing juvenalia. Why rate them? But I think it fair to rate the film adaptations. For example, unlike the adaptations of Emma which need to be longer, this film manages to ""get""the novel on one DVD. The acting is beautiful, the feeling as someone said is ""autumnal"" just like the novel. It is a good antidote to the ever present tendency to reduce Jane Austen to ""Chicklit"". Think Shakespeare or as Rebecca  West said Mozart. One small objection: Jane Austen never used kissing as a romantic gesture. There is a kiss at the end of this movie. They should have left it out.

I think this is a good film overall, but I had to turn on the subtitles in order to catch all of the dialog, particularly when Anne is reading the letter she gets from her beloved toward the end. The voiceover technique kept me from understanding the letter without the subtitles. This is a very slow-paced story, and Amanda Root's performance was too subdued for my tastes, especially at the end when it would have been nice if her love didn't translate to just a wide-eyed stare, Somehow the glow never made it to her face. I still like to watch it over and over again, simply because I like anything Austen these days. However, of all of the movie adaptations, I would rate the Keira Knightley version of Pride and Prejudice at the very top of the list, followed very closely by Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility, which is all the more remarkable when you compare it with the book.",1172793600,5,1017,4.473118279569892

Surely our ancestors would be horrified by the sheer pace and the cacophony of modern life in the twenty-first century.

I can vividly remember visiting my ancient grandparents, - who had my father rather late in their lives, - in their sitting room.  They were both Victorians by birth and temperament. My grandpa reading his newspaper and puffing on his pipe.  My grandma lost in her needlepoint.  The silence of their shared idyll disturbed only by the soft ticking of the clock on the mantle, shattering the quietude by chiming its reminder on the hour.  My boisterous presence interrupting their quiet contentment: the murmured conversation between them both and the cheery talk with welcome visitors.  The soft, hushed colours in the subdued lighting...  A veritable recreation of bygone times and values.  All reproduced here in this wonderful film.",1172016000,6,1027,5.13855421686747
752547,5,6303965415,"I'm a late bloomer when it comes to some pieces of literature,  and when I finally started reading Jane Austen in my 30's,  this book stood out as my definite favorite.  I bought a video of the movie when it first came out,  and feel that it captures perfectly the subdued mood and mature humour of the last masterpiece of this magic author.  I recently got the movie out again,  this time because I'm introducing Austen to my home-schooled 12 year old daughter.  Hopefully she won't be the literary ignoramus her mother was,  she already ""gets""  the perfect phrasing and subtle humour that I probably would not have appreciated at her age.

  I've not seen other adaptations of Persuasion,  but don't see how another could so perfectly capture the essence of the novel.  The performances are perfect,  with Anne being transformed from plain neglected spinster to beautiful beloved wife before our very eyes.  The movie portrays Austen's characters as they surely would have been,  no makeup,  a bit dingy in spots,  surrounded by farm animals in the country,  fishwives in Lyme,  and the elegant viciousness of the first circles in Bath.  I think Ciaran Hinds is one of today's great actors,  and watch him every chance I get,  and he and Amanda Root are fabulous together,  both in this and in ""The Man Who Cried.""  For anyone who appreciates Austen,  as it took me so long to do,  this movie is an absolute must for their collection.",1171843200,11,1436,4.704453441295547

Amanda Root portrays everything with just her facial features, and body language - no words are spoken and there is no need for any. Ciarn Hinds also does very well as the previously thwarted lover. The two of them manage to create tension out of almost nothing.  Then there is Sophia Thompson, brilliant. Anne's father is also played very well.

It's possible that people who haven't read Austen's contemplation on the fate of aristocrats without money and a spinster of 27 won't love the movie as much as I do.

We all know that true love will win out in Austen but the glory of her writing was in the details of how that love is accomplished in the face of overwhelming obstacles as personified in unforgettable personages who create unbelievable situations (the proud and the prejudiced if you prefer).  Mary the hypochrondiac sister is a character for all ages; Sir Michael Redgrave, in my mind, will always be remembered for his full-frontal face camera shot, looking like a nineteenth century Donald Trump as the word is spit from his small mouth: ""RETRENCH?""

The main actress did not have the beautious presence of the protagonists in the adaptations of Mansfield Park, Emma, or the A&E Pride & Prejudice. The sets were not particularly vibrant, and the characters were, well, normal people. However as the movie progressed, i became impressed against my own first impression. Amanda Root brings forth the spellbinding silence and oppression of intelligent, regretful young ladies, with smaller claims to youth and beauty than others. Her pain is so tangible, and her loneliness so palpable, you can't help but feel for the accomplished and overlooked Anne. Like Sense and Sensibilities Colonel Brandon, in Willoughby's words, she is ""the man (in this case woman) that everyone speaks well of, but no one remembers to talk to"". As the film progresses she seems to become prettier and livelier, and her repression begins to lift, and you see her true geniality and open-heartedness. As for Ciaran Hinds...well, not only is he handsome, but he plays his part with such feeling and passion that you can't help but wait in anticipation for the inevitably happy conclusion. Both parts are semi-stereotypical...Anne, who mistakenly turned down her true love due to the faulty advice of her friend, pines and diminishes, becoming quiet and somber in near self-induced solitude. Wentworth, being the man, seeks occupation overseas and tries to forget her. He can't, however he is less forgiving, being the one spurned so many years ago, and you spend half the movie agonizing over his attentions to the unaccomplished, flirtatios, more beautiful Louisa. All in all, a good watch, with the feeling and sad repression of true love that makes Austen amazing.

752732,4,6303965415,"This is clearly one of the most polarising of Jane Austen adaptations on film. Some viewers will love the genuinely moving acting, the authentically costumed characters, the beautiful scenery and sets, the incredible story-telling and the wonderfully subtle touches that abound in this film. Others will loathe the complete absence of makeup, the fact that Amanda Root is visibly older than 29, the slow and tender story, the use of natural lighting and the re-writing of the Mr Elliot sub-plot (including his unforgivably and casually cruel behaviour towards Mrs Smith).

I acknowledge both of these views. Certainly Amanda Root does not enhance her natural sweet looks, and she does look a little too old for the part of Anne Elliot, but mon dieu, her acting! That is something else again. In terms of the emotional involvement and the ability to subtly create this gentle and loving character, no better actress could have been found. If only she'd  been permitted to ""youthify"" her looks a little... After all, in the novel she is described as a very pretty girl - although it's true her looks had faded somewhat, her appearance revives mid-way through the novel to the point where she has enough beauty to attract the admiration of passing gentlemen - but to be honest, I do prefer superb acting to superb looks, and that is why I find Amanda Root's portrayal so very moving and real.

Ciarn Hinds is excellent as Captain Wentworth, Anne's love whose proposal she rejected some years ago. He is not movie-star handsome, but a well-looking man whose serious demeanour is not cloaked by his occasional more lively ripostes. In personality and character, he is undeniably the right match for Ms Root's Anne. The interaction between the two of them is so gracefully subtle that it might be missed by viewers who expect a more obvious approach. He is very deliberately ignoring Anne, although with perfect politeness. More and more, the appreciative viewer will notice that there is a quite remarkable sensitivity between the two of them, and the beauty of Anne's character is so wonderfully brought out by Amanda Root's acting that the love between these two characters is truly and fully realised.

The sub-plots are also superbly explicated. Anne's selfish and heedless father (Corin Redgrave) and monstrously insensitive and vain sister Elizabeth(Phoebe Nicholls), not to mention her laughably tiresome sister Mary (Sophie Thompson), are so well played that one becomes genuinely outraged on Anne's behalf as one sees their carelessly selfish behaviour. Mr Elliot (the brilliant Samuel West) doesn't really get enough storytime in this adaption, unfortunately - I do think the script didn't quite manage to include his motivations and personality well enough for a proper understanding of his character. But the wonderful Fiona Shaw is perfect in the role of Mrs Croft (Anne's put-upon friend who has fallen upon hard times), and Lady Russell (Anne's mentor) is just sheer delight in her well-meaning snobbery as played by Susan Fleetwood. I also found absolutely perfect the self-seeking Mrs Clay (Felicity Dean) and the thoroughly nice Charles Musgrove who, having been rejected by Anne, decided to wed Mary instead (very, very well played by Simon Russell Beale, who makes this sort of role look completely effortless).

The look of this film is lovely in many ways. The lack of makeup may take some getting used to, but there's no denying it's authentic, and with such excellent acting from everyone involved, the dynamics of the film are unsurpassed.

The truly magnificent singing of opera singer Rosa Mannion in one of the scenes is the first truly appropriate musical performance in any Jane Austen film. (All too often, the standard of singing or playing in this sort of film is clearly 'quite nice', but certainly not the result of natural talent honed by years of training - as would indeed have been the case with young ladies of the genteel class. Or... if no natural talent was possessed, perhaps the young lady in question would learn the harp instead of singing. But music was an essential asset for any damsel of the period who had any pretensions at all to social graces.)

To sum up: for those who want a film that is purely escapist, that is full of lovely-looking people floating about in 18th century clothing and that is ""exciting"" to watch, this is probably not a film that will appeal to you. For those, however, who are willing to plunge solely into the subtleties of this film and its beautifully moving performances, there will be great enjoyment for you.",1156636800,32,4587,4.988235294117647

The story revolves around a daughter who is unappreciated by her father and sister, both of whom don't have a clue about the financial condition the family is in.  Coupled with this is the return of a man she has remained in love with for many years, and how they finally throw off the shakles of society and get married.

By the same token, this film version of Persuasion, while perhaps lacking the glamourous faces and costumes that adorn the flock of Austen films produced in the mid-1990's, is far and away the most faithfully adapted movie of the lot.

It was a good thing I did, because without doing that there would have been no way to discover what was going on or where the plot would lead.

In short, the hero of the story returns to find the woman who'd refused to marry him several years before still unmarried and with few prospects.  After some awkward encounters they're thrown back together and the spark returns to their relationship.  Apparently, this is not far-removed from Jane Austen's own life story and maybe why she was able to write about it so well.  Jane never married but her heroine in this story does and may go on to live happily ever after, last time we see them aboard his ship.

This DVD is worth having and re-viewing, but buyers shouldn't expect a ""Pride & Prejudice,"" or even an ""Emma.""  Whoever did the film editing removed about 30 to 45 minutes more than they should have to make a complete story.  Acting, scenery, and character diversity are fine.

""My idea of good company is the fellowship of clever, well informed people, who have a great deal of conversation and a liberality of ideas.  That is what I call good company.""

""That is not good company.  That is . . .""  (If you want to know the rest of the line, then rent the movie).

During her lifetime Jane Austen published her novels anonymously - a choice common for female authors of that time.  One of my favorite college professors had a sentence on a piece of paper on his office door.  It said, ""I'd rather be reading Jane Austen.""  In the early 1800s, before psychology was a science, Jane Austen, an unmarried young woman, had the audacity to publish her thoughts on the workings of the inner mind.

This is an excellent movie adaptation of Austen's final novel, a novel she wrote when her health was failing and she probably knew she had little time left to express what she had to say.  Reading the cast list for this movie is a ""Who's who"" of great actors:  Amanda Root, Ciaran Hinds, Corin Redgrave, Sophie Thompson, etc.  The acting is terrific.  There are certain movies that are so good that I don't wish to comment too much on the movie itself because it is not improved by my commentary.  Other movies in that category include Emma Thompson's Sense & Sensibility (to which Ms. Thompson added many of her own sensibilities to the screenplay).

Austen's characters are often caught up in an internal dialogue, constantly re-evaluating the decisions of the past.  In Austen's era, these thoughts were made more desperate and consequential because romantic love could only be found in one other person.  Her characters are constantly jockeying to gain power, stature, & wealth through social, exclusivity contracts.  For Austen's characters, the one person is usually separated by distance, time, or rules of society.  Austen comments on how the mind seems to concentrate on the imprinted loves of the past (See Spielberg's ""A.I."").  Her heroines tend to think there was a person in their past whose character so well matched their own, that to be reunited would bring some fulfilment.  And in her novels, often the two are combined in the end, defying the odds and rewarding their moral behavior and steadfastness.  The reader can see that the two are not just imprinted on each other;  rather, there are many good reasons why their chemistry works well.

""Captain Wentworth . . . You have an extraodinary ability to discompose my friend sir.""

This is true.  The book is titled ""Persuasion"".  It is not titled ""Control"".  The protagonists in the movie argue regularly with the intent to be persuasive, not to be controlling - and that is an essential distinction.

""Perhaps you have not been in Bath long enough to learn to enjoy these parties they give.""

""They mean nothing to me.  Those who hold them believe the theatre to be beneath their dignity, but I am no card player.""

""No.  You never were, were you?""

Jane Austen, as a young woman was a genius ahead of her time, and in some ways is still ahead of our time.  Great authors and artists find a way to speak to their generation in a way that both respects the status quo, yet somehow uses metaphor or narrative to look on the status quo's priorities from a new perspective.  For example, Willa Cather's ""My Antonia"" may be one of the first great works of lesbian literature (although most people would probably disagree with me).  That book certainly is not written from an ordinary male ""voice"", even if the narrator is male.  Similarly, Jane Austen questioned every social construct around her and tried to illustrate the conflicts that the social systems created against the natural, moral drives of the human psyche.  Her debate has fascinated us for hundreds of years.

The movie is not about ""old, boring people who lived hundreds of years ago.""  Like all her novels, this movie is robust and a worthwhile social discourse today.

752804,5,6303965415,"I love this movie!  Amanda Root (forgive me for saying this) is a plainer and slightly older Anne than I had envisioned, but her acting is so wonderful, that we soon forget the physical discrepancy between the book and the movie. (Don't get me wrong, Amanda Root is in no way unattractive, but in the novel, Anne is constantly praised for her beauty/handsomeness, although at the ""ripe old age"" of 27, she is apparently past her ""bloom."")  Ciarin Hinds played the jilted lover to perfection: he all but ignores Anne during the movie's early scenes and never betrays the feelings he tries fruitlessly to supress. He woos Louisa Musgrove as a ruse to deny his own feelings for Anne.  It isn't until Captain Wentworth observes how fatigued Anne is during a long walk with his friends and acquaintances, that we see his concern for Anne's welfare is still intact. Anne is very touched by this gesture of Captain Wentworth in securing her a space on his sister and brother-in-law's carriage where there is room for only one lady.

Anne and the nouveau riche captain are given another chance at love, despite interferring friends and dubious circumstances. Anne's cousin, Mr. Elliot, suddenly feels the lure of social respectability.  I don't think the screenwriter needed to change Mr. Elliot's financial circumstances in order to make him appear more odious to the audience.  In the book, Mr. Elliot had more than enough money, but he thought marrying Anne would bring about the appearance of social respectability. He unsuccessfully tries to woo her (""Really Mr. Elliot, this is too much flattery"").  It is too bad he didn't set his sights on Elizabeth Elliot, as they seem cut from the same fabric.  Captain Wentworth misinterprets Anne's feelings for her cousin (thank God we don't marry our cousins anymore!).  However, in one of movie history's most beautiful scenes, Captain Wentworth subtly gestures to Anne that he has written her a letter. I cry every time I watch Anne read about Wentworth's true feelings for her and how he could never forget her, try as he may.

One part of the movie that I didn't quite like was the portrayal of Lady Russell. Yes, she was officious and misguided, but she was like a second mother to Anne (in the book).  In the movie, she is practically demonized as an unrepentant social snob, whom Wentworth ""will find difficult to forgive.""  In the book, Wentworth and Lady Russell are reconciled, and she recognizes the error of her judgment and short-sightedness. She did try to act in Anne's best interest, but like our charming and irrepressible Emma, ended up being completely in the wrong regarding matters of the heart and matchmaking.

I loved the soprano (Rosa Mannion) who sang during one of the concerts in Bath. What a voice! I'd love to hear more from this singer.",1151193600,12,2807,4.847280334728033
752805,4,6303965415,"The first time I saw this movie I did not like it at all. I had just come off of seeing the fabled A and E version of Pride and Prejudice and was expecting more of the same - pretty people in lavish costumes exchanging witty bantor in lovely houses. What I got was average looking and mostly vulgar people in a slow-moving storyline where it seemed like nothing would ever happen. It wasn't until repeated viewings that I came to appreciate the subtleties of this film, and the fact that the casting choices and even the almost agonizing pace were an absolutely perfect and right way to bring this novel to the screen.

For you see, the story revolves around Anne, an aging woman on the verge of spinsterhood who is quite unexpectedly thrown into the company of an old lover, Captain Wentworth. This is not some fiery attraction aka Mr Darcy and Elizabeth, but rather a slow-burning tension that both parties are trying to repress throughout the film for fear of being shot down. The acting by both leads is superb (watch for the scene when Anne sees Captain Wentworth for the first time in eight years and has to grab a chair for support). And it is lovely to see the almost-dowdy Anne slowly blossom as the film goes on.

And while I mentioned that overall this is not a funny piece, of course there are a few inspired Austen characters. My favorites are Anne's sister Mary, who is always supposing herself sick, and Anne's father who has some of the best lines in the movie (""Anne?? You want to marry ANNE? Whatever for""?)

The movie is shot in a way that is more keeping with what the time period would have really looked like.  The cast is not a typically beautiful Hollywood group and look like they could live next door.  Amanda Root does such a wonderful job of making Anne's transformation from the workhorse spinster sister to an independent (as much as possible at the time) happy woman.

Ms. Root wonderfully portrays the disillusioned yet romantic Anne, and captures the essence of her being, which you can see in the touching metamorphosis she goes through, both  touching and empoworing. Mr. Hinds brings subtlety to the dashing Captain Wentworth and the sense of reserve and resentment he harbors for Anne is all but broken through his acquaitance with her.  But the beauty of the film lies in the way it presents British society, and the interaction between the classes for power, love and money. The supporting cast brilliantly contrasts the fickleness and superficiality of the titled, with the more greagarious, engaging, and friendly non-titled-- the rich landowners, the educated, the Navy, and the working class...

This gem of a film brought to us by BBC Films is beautifully shot, and the restraint that true lovers have with one another is one of the most poignant episodes in the rocky courtship between Anne and Wentworth.

Less comedic than Ms. Austen's other works, Persuasion really is about knowing what you want, and be pursuaded to pursue your happiness.

Amanda Root is nice-looking, but too plain in my eye to attract the attention of Mr. Elliott, who didn't know who she was when he first saw her.  Some bits of storyline were altered or left out - most notably, when Mary chides Ann for not coming to her sooner, Ann says here that she ""had much to do,"" while the book and earlier movie point out that Mary had told her not to come yet, which reflects Mary's vascillating and selfish personality better; the Musgroves' dead brother/son, who served with Captain Wentworth, is non-existent in this movie.

As a result it was over looked when it came out. Amazing acting. An  interpersonal subtlety rarely seen in films.  We're too buisy with special  affects extravaganzas.

Persuasion tells the story of lost love renewed, and gives the viewer a taste of the grandness and degradation, of 19th century England. Diverse lifestyles of classes clash and we see the prejudices come forth when a lady: Anne Elliot( Root) rejects a dignified but penniless naval officer Capt. Wentworth (Hinds).

Eight years later, Anne's father's extravagant lifestyle catches up with him. And, Anne must face a truth-- that the man 'beneath her' was the man 'for her.'Obstacles arise, preventing Anne and Wentworth from declaring their feelings at first. But then, both of them come to grips with the fact that they love each other despite everything.

752972,4,6303965415,"The adaptation in many ways is faithful to the book certainly in intent. Persuasion is a relatively short book so the movie is not that long either. And in some ways that is my only objection. It feels even shorter than it is. I am not sure why. Like many Austen adaptations I feel that the movies loose some of the richness in language and personal interactions. The scenery and Bath, as in any Austen adaptation, are breathtaking.

I found Anne father (mr Walter Elliot) and her sisters, Elizabeth and Mary, just as annoying as I expected. Specifically Elizabeth is a real nasty creature.
The initial discomfort between Captain Wentworth and Anne is palatable. The scene where Anne first gets to meet the Musgroves in the big house again, is very funny, very Austen. Anne's friend Mrs Smith is so nice, would have loved to have seen those scenes expanded a bit.

All in all an enjoyable evening when watching this, but the book certainly wins hands down.",1136505600,8,956,4.684523809523809

The movie is rather short, I don't know how they did it - fit everything in and have not given up anything improtant.  I thought the script was a real work of art and talant - so few words (sometimes not even words, but only looks) and so much meaning is relayed.

Actors (particulary Ann and Captain Wentworth) are magnificent - they capture their characters so true to the novel - the filmmakers were really lucky to find such fantastic cast.  Why hasn't Amanda Root been seen in any other movies is beyond my imagination, she was amazingly genuine. (seriously, I cant fathom why she was not appreciated by many reviewers here, her acting was so authentic)

I reread the novel recently and rewatched the movie.  I am just amazed at the talant of whoever wrote the script - it's a jem!",1136419200,20,887,4.50625
753031,5,6303965415,"Persuasion and Pride and Prejudice are my favorite Austen books.

Persuasion is a quiet story written near the end of Austen's life.  It is about a young woman, Anne Elliot, who is persuaded to give up the man she loves because he has no means to provide for her.

Years later he comes back with money and position (a Captain of the Navy) while her fortunes have lessened.  She has never gotten over him, he has never forgiven her for her rejection.

This movie does a fine job of capturing all the emotional nuances of the book.

The two leads do a marvelous job at conveying to the viewer their past history and the emotional toll it has taken upon them both.

The scene when Wentworth walks in on Mary and Anne as they are eating breakfast, the first time they've seen each other since their broken engagement, is thick with tension.  The resentment is washing off of Wentworth in waves, while Anne is almost overcome.

While Wentworth courts Lousia, his anger to Anne is front and center.  It is as if he is saying to her ""See what you gave up? I don't need or want you anymore.""  Yet he still cares if she suffers, as the scene where he asks his sister to take her back to Uppercross illustrates.  We feel Anne's shock and his discomfort that he would care she is tired.

The pivotal scene when Harville and Anne are debating who loves longest, man or woman, is brilliant.  Both characters convey such depth of emotion yet respect for the other.

The scene where Anne reads Wentworth's declaration of love is beautiful.  The director had both actors read the letter so we hear both of their voices.  Wentworth's voice is full of frustration,passion and hope.  Anne's voice begins incredulous and evolves in to joy.

The only complaint I have is the Mrs. Smith subplot.  I wished they had left it intact, as it provides a richer texture to Anne's realization of just who Mr. Elliot really is.

I appreciated the nod to Austen's original ending (which she thankfully changed to include one my favorite love letters in literature) with the inclusion of Wentworth having a comission from the Admiral to find out where Anne and Mr. Elliot plan to live after they marry.

Root is not a Hollywood beauty, but while Anne Elliot is supposed to be pretty, time and disappointment has ravaged her looks.  I thought she captured Anne perfectly.

This is my favorite screen adaptation of an Austen book. It is very true to the reflective spirit of the novel.",1135209600,36,2450,4.5793103448275865
753032,5,6303965415,"Many have called this particular Austen book dark. It is. It is also about what happens when Life's chances have passed us by. Have we spent them well? Do we have any regrets? This movie is a glimpse into what can happen when someone is given a second chance...yet, will our main character Anne decide to take it? Or will she cave in yet again to her families wishes?

One of the delights of this film, as well as the darker aspects, is the unvarnished look into the lives of the families around Anne. We see her own family's problems, and we also see what could have been had she married someone else and made other choices. Anne herself is well respected by many who frankly, are people in this day and age would be well liked!

The main reason I love this film besides how well the characters are defined is that the atmosphere created is so real. It is like having a glimpse into this particular moment in time: into differing people's lives, their connections with each other, and the light of the candles on the tables.....it's almost as if one were a voyeur standing outside watching everyone enjoy themselves.

753034,5,6303965415,"Anne Elliot, a shy, unassuming and unmarried ""old maid"" of 27, lives a quiet life in the country with her noble family, at Kellynch Hall.  That is, until the state of her family's finances (""You must retrench!"") forces them to move from their lavish home in the country, to the not-quite-so-comparable comfort of Bath, in order to rent out their home (and get themselves out of debt).  The new tenants of Kellynch Hall are Admiral & Mrs. Croft, whose brother, Fredrick Wentworth, Anne had been engaged to at the tender young age of 19.  Anne had reluctantly broken off their engagement at her family & friends' persuasion, as ""he had nothing to recommend him: no fortune, no connections"" and her spirits were said to have ""never been high, since...your disappointment.""  When Captain Fredrick Wentworth returns from 8 years at sea, with elevated social status and newly-acquired wealth, his appearance sparks a series of events in the lives of all the Elliot girls: Elizabeth, Mary & most of all Anne...

When I saw this film as a teenager with my mom & friend at an independent theater outside Washington, D.C., I came out with a sense that this was one of the better films out there.  That this was the type of film I had been looking for all my life: a wonderfully done, well-filmed, superbly-acted ""period piece""...I must say that ""Persuasion"" was likely the start of it all for me.  ""Persuasion,"" which was then followed closely by Emma Thompson's ""Sense & Sensibility,"" had me hooked: I had been given the bait and I had fallen for it.  From that point on, I became a huge fan of period films: I have since consumed every well-known and obscure period film I could possibly get my hands on, but it all goes back to that first theatrical viewing of ""Persuasion"".

The dialog is amazing!  The subtle ways that the Elliot family persecute Anne are beyond compare: I have never again to this day, seen such a brilliant exercise in underlying snubs & barbs: slight criticisms & faint scorns from Anne's family that are never rude or direct but are always subtle and seemingly innocuous (although they often cut to the quick).  Anne takes them so well, and clearly loves her family in spite of it all.  The scenes are beautifully filmed, the costuming well-done, and the scenery breathtaking.  The scene where Anne reads the letter is so touching!  And I must say the true-to-the-period ending scenes are simply wonderful: Jane Austen would have been proud!

For those of you worried about family-friendly content: no need to worry!  There is little to object to in this film: there are very, very suble allusions to a possible liaison, so subtle that most never discover them.  There is a scene where a young lady falls and hurts herself; there is a little language: a few uses of d*mn, and little else.

This quiet, unobtrusive, slow-moving, delight of film gem is well worth any time you devote to it: when watching for the first time, I would recommend giving it your full attention and not being too tired.  It is very mellow & quiet, and may take you awhile to get into, but will be well worth the effort in the end.  ""Persuasion"" would have to be one of my favorite period pieces of all time, along with ""Pride & Prejudice"" and ""North & South.""

From the moment it started I was drawn into the story. Anne Elliot (Amanda Root) was in love with a common man and was forced to give him up - leaving her so many years later classified as a 'Plain Jane' and 'Old Maid'. Amanda looks the part and acts is perfectly.

Unexpectantly he returns, no longer a commoner but a Captain - Captain Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds). But he shows no interest in Anne, but the younger prettier girls.

Of course, he can't deny his true feelings forever and has to make a move or leave.

My only slight disappointment was that there is no bonus on the DVD, but I recommend it all the same.",1132963200,5,744,4.145833333333333
753036,5,6303965415,"Other reviewers seem to see this film only as a cosy, romantic piece of escapism. I can't help but feeling that they are missing something.

This is a slow and beautiful film, which, in spite of its happy ending, has a gentle sorrow to it. Time is passing by for Anne Elliot - she's older than any other Austen heroine, and this sense of lost youth is very present in the film.

This is also one of the few films I have seen that actually captures the feeling of being in love. Anne sees Captain Wentworth passing in the street or is helped by him into a carriage - these are the small moments that can be described for a page or two in the books. Modern films tend to want more drama, but this adaptation sticks to the ""small canvas"" that Jane Austen worked with, and does so brilliantly.

Nothing is harder than making nice people interesting, but in this Persuasion really is a success. Amanda Root plays Anne with a lot of warmth and intelligence, and Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth is also very likeable.

Watching this film left me with a little bit melancholic, but also uplifted. It seems to describes so accurately how it feels to be alive, to love and long, with both humour and wistfulness. It's more than just escapism, and deserves better attention than playing in the background as you hover your flat.",1129852800,38,1319,4.483333333333333

Although I don't think Persuasion is as charismatic as P&P, it is still very well done. Amanda Root represents Anne's qualities very charmingly and Ciarn Hinds is very masculine, but gentle at the same time.

Concerning the other characters I imagined Elizabeth would be more attractive (externally!) as it is so often emphasized in the book and Mr Elliot would be more mature: the actor seemed to me a bit young to add real weight and interest to this character.

The movie does such an excellent job of making the audience wait and wait and wait for any sight or word of the Captain that we truly feel the plight of our poor heroine.  Her life is one of domesticity and sequestered emotions.  On the surface all is placid, but beneath beats a tortured heart and mind.

This movie (Persuasion) really erased the wonderful scenes and scenarios that I had created in my mind after reading the book.

Amanda Root is so very unconvincing and wrongly cast. While I will not criticize her God given physical appearance, I will say this... she made horribly annoying facial expressions. She also looks oh so much older than 27, she looks pretty much close to 20 years older than that and I am not being mean either. There is absolutely nothing wrong with looking one's age, she just was not suited for such a young part and like wise neither was the actor that played her former suitor (Wentworth).

 They move on to be persuaded by the inaccuracy of opinion proved over time, and persuaded by a slow growing sense of reignited love and passion. Being 19th Century people the simmer slowly over events that would overwhelm and excite modern day folk and the characters are polite and understated.

 Root and Hinds are pivotal in driving this drama with accuracy and excellence but the nature of their simmering stoicism has perhaps made this an overlooked drama. It is beautiful in it's comments on the coming good of the human conditon and the historical placement and projection is stunning.

The heroine, Anne Elliot, is an intelligent and gentle woman, whose sense and generous spirit are slighted by her vain and vacuous family. We see that, in spite of having been persuaded not to marry a poor sailor eight years previously, her steadfast nature eventually convinces the hurt and stubborn Wentworth, now a naval officer, to rekindle the romance after many obstacles have been overcome.

753179,4,6303965415,"Jane Austen's Persuasion, her last great novel, comes to life in great perfection in this 1995 film version. Starring Amanda Root as Anne Elliot and Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth, this version of the classic is certainly admirable in both performance and faithfulness to the work itself. While the story is both a satire and a drama, the pervading question that surfaces is: what can we do when we let someone important slip away from us? For Anne Elliot, she must not only live in the present, but deal with a past love when Captain Wentworth resurfaces in her life years after their failed love.

One of the great things about this version is not only its succinctness, but the great effort by the cast. While the movie is barely over one hour and a half long, it still keeps much of the relevant plot within the script. There is not a sense of dragging the story around; we get right into the main issues of the work and the story shifts rather quickly. The cast itself was also commendable-for instance, Anne's sister, Elizabeth, who is played by Pheobe Nichols, comes across perfectly as someone who is a bit snobbish and only concerned with the issue of class and reputation for both herself and her sister.

Another successful aspect of the film is the ability to depict accurately the social values that are so crucial to the book's relevancy. For example, we really get a true look at how much family pressure made a difference in determining marital values, as is demonstrated in the case of Anne Elliot and her family's wishes that leave her feeling guilty and frustrated years later.

The most essential aspect of filming a classic is to bring forth the vitality of the book, and this one does this successfully. We see the story of a woman who must try to put her family's wishes and other's interferences aside in order to find what is truly essential to her well-being.  Anne must also fight through the frustrations of others interfering in something that is paramount to her own life-love.",1111536000,8,2010,4.685552407932011

753182,5,6303965415,"'Persuasion' as a novel is flawless and to adapt it onto film, that was undoubtedly going to be a colossal task. The reason for this being that story is about love lost and the fear that it might never be able to be regained, two subjects that are difficult to portray without great acting, scenery and music. Luckily for the viewer, this adaptation of 'Persuasion' has all of that.

It really resonates with you from how it just captures each character perfectly and displays how aggravating the unbearably suffocating social etiquette of Regency England truly was. This might have seemed 'romantic' and 'emotional' in some overly sentimental Hollywood period films but in this adaptation, you see how heartbreaking it is. It is a raw and unflinching portrayal of how Regency England would have been like for the debt-ridden landed gentry yet it is a subtle and almost repressed tale of the choices we make.

The acting is sublime, I cannot applaud it more and other reviewers agree with me so it just can't be dissed! The music was beautiful and I loved the attention to detail that the camera gave - it just shows that the BBC weren't trying to make an adaptation that would make loads of money, they did it to fulfill what Austen wanted us to see.

I can see why some enthusiasts of the novel would feel that better looking people should have played the two main characters because that is Austen describes it in the book but don't be put off! The choice of actors actually works better because it is just about pure emotion, not how fit they are in the book.

Last Thought: This adaptation won't be for everyone but if you just want to appreciate matters of the soul without having image or superficiality in the middle of things, don't be dissuaded - watch 'Persuasion'.",1105660800,21,1776,4.664536741214057
753183,5,6303965415,"I happened across this movie in, of all places, a bargain bin several years ago. This is one of my all time favorite movies. Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root give knock out proformances, the supporting cast is just as high caliber, the sets are accurate and visually stimulating and the film, IMO, is on par with A&E's Pride and Prejudice.

I recently began switching my VHS over to DVD. While this DVD has no special features, it was great getting a more accurate cover than the old VHS had (an embarrasing ""clutch"" shot of two models who aren't ever in the movie!). If you love the Regency period or an ""Austenite""-you cannot pass this film up:)",1104796800,13,643,4.543103448275862

But when compared to Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility, Gwenyth Paltrow's Emma and Francis O'Conner in Mansfield Park, this film adaptation of 'Persuasion' is my favourite.

I found it difficult to accept the actress as Anne at first,  butshe does grow on you. I found this film exquisite and true to the spirit of the novel.  This version delivers in quality above all the rest.",1095724800,14,548,4.6875

753267,5,6303965415,"""Most faithful"" doesn't always equal ""best"" for film adaptations: often you want to see a new angle to the material if you loved the book that formed the basis for the screenplay. Yet Roger Michell's adaptation of ""Persuasion"" for the BBC is perhaps the most faithful of the many Austen adaptations that followed, and is still simultaneously the best. Like Patricia Rozema in :""Mansfield Park,"" he brings great intelligence and brings forth certain latent ideas in the text that speak to the era in which he filmed it: he shows the grubbiness of the Regency era, and emphasizes the differences in class relations. But unlike Rozema, Michell has the good sense to trust Austen and allow his heroine to be as quiet and as patient as the author wrote her to be. Amanda Root, with her beautiful undertsanding eyes that speak volumes, is as faithful to Austen's conception of the role as could be imagined. The rest of the cast is terrific: Corin Redgrave enjoyed some well deserved praise later in his career for his snobbish and empty headed Sir Walter Elliot, and Phoebe Nicholls is just as good as his eldest daughter (given to fits of pique against her sister Anne). The compositions are also marvelous, with tremendous innovative use being made of the actual Bath and Lyme Regis locations.",1090627200,19,1290,4.841628959276018
753268,5,6303965415,"This movie is not only the best film adaptation of a Jane Austen novel, it's also a wonderful film in its own right.  What did I love about it?
1) It isn't stuffy and unnatural.  The characters sound human when they speak; you can imagine that this is how people spoke in the 19th century - not like pompous orators, but like real people.  The world surrounding the characters isn't overly polished or brightly lit; again, there's a natural, ""lived-in"" feeling to all the buildings and landscapes; they do not look like they came out of a glossy postcard.
2) The performances.  I don't have enough praise for Amanda Root, who plays Anne Elliot, a woman whose marriage prospects are slim to nil, and who has just been thrown into the company of a man whom she rejected years ago.  Root can speak volumes just with her eyes, and everything about her fits perfectly with the gentle, wry and intelligent Anne Elliot.  As Captain Wentworth, Ciaran Hinds is also great; he disappears into the character.  Both actors aren't conventionally beautiful or handsome either; Root in particular blossoms before the viewers eyes - at first she's very faded and quiet, and then we (like Wentworth) see her spirit shine out.  In addition to Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, the rest of the cast also do a wonderful job.  Perhaps because there aren't any big name actors, we can get totally immersed in the film.
3) It's true to Austen.  There's subtle humor, real human feeling, and a keen understanding of human nature.  It's an unforgettable love story.
4) The kiss.  One kiss - perfectly timed, perfectly executed...  you will melt.
5) The soundtrack.  This holds true particularly for the assembly at Bath, and the Italian vocal pieces.",1089763200,152,1721,4.77027027027027
753269,3,6303965415,"Everyone was cast well, except for Anne. Yes, she's supposed to be tired, plain, worn out, lost her ""bloom"". But she was once a pretty girl and she's also supposed to have a sense of humour, and have enough manners to hide her own feelings in a social setting.
Amanda Root's Anne in this movie is seriously plain/unattractive, and one can't imagine how she could ever be considered pretty 8 years ago with her long nose, plain eyes, and indeterminate jawline. But that's not the problem.
The problem is that in every scene in which Captain Wentworth's name is mentioned, her eyes go all big, her jaw drops, and she goes all pale and frozen and can't function in a social setting. She becomes a total dumbwit. When Wentworth's name is mentioned, Anne is supposed to be stricken, barely functioning mentally, yet also hiding it beneath her manners and continuing to attend to others in conversation. Furthermore, Amanda Root's Anne doesn't show any conversational ability until she's talking with Mr. Elliot in Bath. A little late in the movie, isn't it?
The Anne portrayed by Ms. Firbanks in the 1971 version of Persuason is at least 10 years too old, but I preferred that Anne's social adeptness. Even when stricken, she tried to hide it and spare the people around her from being worried about her, and acted graciously. And you could see her past beauty, and her conversational/social graces.
The rest of the movie is good, the costumes, classical music, Captain Wentworth is particularly well cast, etc. Although Bentwick is dreadfully unattractive and the conversation often too quiet to understand.",1086048000,7,1603,4.918819188191882

753273,5,6303965415,"I've seen this Austen adaptation three times, and it never fails to entertain.  Austen has captured the era in which she lived so well, this film treatment seldom hits a false note.

I'm no Austen scholar, just a lover of costume dramas.  I enjoyed this one more than most, principally because of Amanda Root.  Let's face facts.  Emma Thompson in Sense and Sensability, and Gwyneth Paltrow in Emma are just gorgeous women.  Amanda Root is more plain, and as a consequence, more believable in the role.  Yes, you can forget Thompson and Paltrow in their roles, but the just aren't representative of what I imagine English women a couple of centuries ago.

The acting is solid, the British accents understandable (some films out of Australia and Scotland, especially, really need subtitles!), and the sets fit what one would expect from that era.

This is the definitive Persuasion, in my opinion.  There are great characters here, and very good acting, even from minor roles.  The film doesn't drag, and you really feel Anne Eliot's sense of loss and regret.

Also stars the wonderful Susan Fleetwood and Corin Redgrave.  Ciarn Hinds as Captain Wentworth was also very good.

Very Highly Recommended!  This is a must-see!

Update:  I've seen this film four or five times now, and it is as good on the fourth viewing as the first.  First-rate in all ways.",1076716800,4,1353,4.834061135371179
753274,4,6303965415,"A marriage prospect rejected years earlier due to money and class differences seems to be on the lovers' minds as they encounter one another once again. As with all Jane Austen tales, however, the path to marriage is littered with meddling family and friends and many moments of doubt.
This is a slow moving but very romantic movie. Heroine's struggle builds quietly to a very satisfying conclusion. Lead characters, portrayed by Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, aren't meant to be the prettiest, youngest, or most unforgettable people you'll get to know; their story centers on the internal struggle of what's at stake in seeking a second chance.  The movie, like the book, has an understated feel and includes several little twists and turns. Well acted, classic settings, and a gentle romantic air throughout: I heartily recommend this movie.",1075852800,2,842,5.101449275362318
753275,3,6303965415,"My copy of the novel ""Persuasion"" refers to it as having an ""autumnal"" tone, which has definitely carried over into this adaptation. It makes no pretensions to being another ""Pride and Prejudice,"" or ""Sense and Sensibility"", lacking those books' underlying theme of warm friendship between sisters. Nor is it like ""Emma"" or ""Northanger Abbey,"" both comedies featuring immature women and their self-discovery. In other words, ""Persuasion"" may be a disappointment to those who passionately love one of those other stories, and expect the same thing. This is ironic, considering that some believe ""Persuasion"" was based on an incident in Jane Austen's real life, where she apparently turned away a suitor in her youth, and later regretted it.
Again - the ""autumnal"" tone is picked up by the two leads, who are older and less conventionally attractive than, say, Kate Beckingsdale or Jeremy Northam. Ciaran Hinds has a quiet charisma that grows the longer you watch him, and has developed into a viable leading man. Amanda Root begins the film as a grey little mouse and transforms into a more lovely woman halfway through, solely through her skill as an actress, and not through a film of vasoline smeared on the camera.
Those who complain that Root is not pretty enough to fit their mental image are missing the point, and probably did not read the book, where Austen points out that Anne's beauty had faded with age. (As we read on, we realize that it's her love for life that's dimmed, which in turn has affected her attractiveness to others. Her handsome father certainly becomes less good-looking each time his prissy behavior is described.)
In the film, it would be easy to pull a ""Grease""-like transformation - where, like Olivia Newton John, Amanda Root comes out all dolled up in makeup and a hot bodice, ready to jump on the Regency tilt-a-whirl. But the Captain and Anne regain their passion for another through their rediscovery of each other's hearts, not their good looks - although seeing each other's good character instantly brightens their countenance and puts a spring in their step, making them much more attractive. Neither Hinds nor Root need a gallon of makeup to make this transformation believable.
The two performances that I enjoyed most, however, were that of Sophie Thompson and Fiona Shaw. Thompson, who was only vaguely boorish in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" as a woman despairing of meeting a quality mate, goes full-hog as a high maintenance mooch. Very funny.
Shaw, on the other hand, is one of the funniest things about the ""Harry Potter"" movies, as Harry's dreadful aunt. Here, she is positively vibrant as a happy naval wife. She just brims with love and vigor, believable as a woman who has travelled the seas to be with her husband, and who wishes happiness for her younger brother and all around her. Both the character and the portrayal make a fine contrast to Anne's waspish sisters and father, and the overindulgent yet loving Musgroves. Only five years older than costar Root, with what seems to be a great range, I wonder what charm Shaw might have brought to the role of Anne if she had been offered the part at an appropriate age.
This is a warm, and yes, subtle movie, which will chase away the blues on a winter day.",1073520000,171,3265,4.853046594982079
753276,4,6303965415,"I thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Persuasion."" Unlike some other reviewers on this site, I found Amanda Root to be a perfect choice for the role of Anne Elliott, who had ""lost her bloom"" at age 27. At the beginning of the movie, Root's Anne is timid, often self-effacing, and her physical appearance is, frankly, plain. Thoroughout the course of the film, as she rediscovers her feelings for Captain Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds)she becomes more animated and self-assured, and by the end of the movie, sure of the captain's love, she positively blooms again. I liked the cast in general, although I thought that Hinds may have been an older Captain Wentworth than Austen envisioned. Corin Redgrave gave his usual excellent performance as the vain and foppish father of Anne and Elizabeth. I did not care for Phoebe Nicholls interpretation of Elizabeth Elliott, however. Ms Nicholls, who was so brilliant in ""Brideshead Revisited,"" played Elizabeth (who is in her late 20s) as a spoiled teenager who would have been more at home in the Los Angeles of the 1990s than early 19th century England. Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma) and Fiona Shaw were outstanding as Mary Musgrove and Mrs. Croft, respectively.
The film makers did take some liberties with the story....it has been commented on several times by critics that Anne and the Captain never kissed in Austen's novel. While this is true, most of the film adaptations of Austen's works that I have seen include scenes of kissing between men and women who have come to an understanding of their love for each other. ""Persuasion"" is certainly a more faithful adaptation of Austen than is ""Mansfield Park,"" which was released about the same time, probably because it does not have a political ax to grind.",1072396800,28,1770,4.962962962962963

753337,5,6303965415,"Persuasion is a masterpiece of subtlety, a fine example of
the kind of film that can be made when all involved place
quality over market value. The film is not for the dense, as it requires patience and the understanding of an era, challenging viewers to read the subtext and to listen to Austen's richly written characters. Notice (those who've seen the film many times) how lines giving away important details are thrown away, spoken in a matter-of-fact manner, so easy to miss if you're not paying close attention. It took me several viewings to
grasp every detail of the story (haven't read the book).
In fact, it took me a couple of viewings to even like the film, much less love it as I do now!
I wanted it so much to be as electrifying as Pride and Prejudice. I wanted fireworks from these two lovers, the kind of impassioned conversations you'd hear from Miss Bennett and Mr. Darcy. But it's just not that kind of romance. Anne and Wentworth have a private and painful history that nobody seems to understand but them. There is the surface knowledge between the other characters, but then such a heavy, quiet knowledge between the main two. They are NOT meant to engage in a battle of wits or lash out at one another in fits of anger. They are meant to rekindle the deep, meaningful feelings they once had for each other, but delicately, gradually, and almost as secretly as their initial engagement.
Amazing how this dashing, macho Captain of the Navy becomes stifled around Anne. Love is so much scarier to him than any sea battle. At first he is aloof, avoids her, downright ignores her. He comes around so gradually, yet so inevitably, as does Anne's soul. And nobody notices the reasons for their respective transformations, their growing attachment, but them. Their affection for one another is their own little secret shared only with the most sensitive viewer.
I urge those who didn't like it to watch it again. There is so much beauty and grace in this film. It is a rare and genuine treasure.",1069027200,14,2010,4.648876404494382
753338,3,6303965415,"This video adaptation of my favorite JA novel starts wonderfully, features a near-perfect cast and sets, and even wardrobe.  But about halfway through the story the script takes a couple of odd turns, departing from the spirit of the novel in ways I found irritating.  These departures seemed designed to hustle things along to fit a movie timeframe, which is unavoidable, but they didn't have to be quite so obvious.

For instance, Wentworth stiffly requests a private interview on a street corner to ask on behalf of ""my admiral"" whether she'll want to move into Kellynch after marrying Mr. Elliot?!  And declares his intention of marrying Anne right in the middle of Sir Walter and Elizabeth's party--to everyone?!

Austen had written an early ending that used a PRIVATE interview, but she ditched this (for good reason) and replaced it with a chat with the admiral and the letter.  Austen had decided the interview conclusion was too rushed--which I suppose is why they used it for the movie.

Overall, the first half is worth the annoyance of the second. Someone who hasn't read the book over and over won't notice much wrong, but brace yourself, dedicated Austen fan, for a few bumps along the road.  The perfect video adaptation may come along someday.",1068163200,18,1259,4.90566037735849

It shows the delicate, scathing and halarious language of Jane Austen in the matter in which it was intended...by portraying the manners of the times, the situations that could create this irony it really gives us a fully realized adaptation.  I think that Amanda Root and Cieran Hinds are marvelous along with all the players.  I cannot watch this movie and be bored.  I wish that it had shown more of what happened in the end with her shoolgirl friend as I always thought that Austen put in these characters as a small reflection on what she thought her financial situation was at the time but other than that, it is perfection!",1067558400,4,705,4.52755905511811
753340,4,6303965415,"Although I have read several Jane Austen books and then saw the movie, that was not the case with Persuasion.  I didn't know the story and so didn't know what to expect.
I watched it the first time and was a little let down because at first it really DID seem a little boring as other viewers have mentioned in their reviews.  But then on a rainy Sunday afternoon (isn't that the best times to watch romantic movies??) I watched it again and LOVED it this time!  I think I had just missed a lot of the subtleties the first time around and think that must be the case with the viewers who submitted poor reviews...they just missed all the undercurrents and subtleties.
The first time I saw the movie I did not see the handsomeness or beauty in the Captain or Anne but by the end of the second viewing I was in love with the Captain and finally noticed that although Anne is mousy, she is the prettiest female in the movie.  Especially at the end when they both were just glowing.  Is that glow, especially on Anne's face, just a good makeup artist's trick or fine acting...or just a projection of how you, yourself feel about the characters by the end of the movie??  All the characters are really not very attractive looking in this movie, but I loved that because it seemed mover REAL.  How many times have you heard how beautiful some historic figure (Anne Boleyn, Marie Antionette??) was supposed to be, then saw a picture of them and thought...uggg!  Different time periods have different ideals of beauty.  From pictures that I have seen of this time period, the women really DID look like this, not like so-called modern beauties like Gweneth Paltrow as she was in Emma.
A couple of the scenes that I absolutely adore are where Anne is at the opera.  She is there with Mr Elliot, who wants Anne also, but only for what a marriage with her can do for him.  She is ignoring Mr Elliot, who is trying to tell Anne of his feelings and intentions, because she can see that Captain Wentworth is leaving because he can see what is going on between them.  She runs to stop the Captain from leaving begging him to stay which he will not due because of his jealousy of Mr Elliot, who is also standing there with them having this very passionate conversation.  Everyone is watching them instead of the singer!  Little, meek, spinsterish Anne now has TWO men wanting her! The other scene I love is the one where the Captain is coming over to ask Anne's father if he can marry Anne.  Her self-absorbed sister who seems to despise Anne and lords over her, and almost treats her as a servant throughout the movie, actually tells her to try not to monopolize the Captain's time when he arrives...probably so that she may have a chance at him. And when the Captain asks for Anne's hand in marriage, her father is actually in disbelief that it is Anne the Captain wants.
So, if you watch this the first time and didn't like it, watch it again and you will be very pleasantly surprised.",1065225600,8,2972,4.447513812154696
753341,5,6303965415,"""Persuasion,"" the film, is a faithful adaptation of Jane Austen's final completed novel, and to my mind her finest book. It is directed, with subtlety and brilliance, by Roger Michell. The film is quite able to stand alone, on its own merits - you don't have to know Ms. Austen's work to be captivated by the pure magic of the romance, the Regency English period history, brilliant characterizations, color, music and costumes of this extraordinary drama brought to life on the screen. The movie deals with the same social issues as the book, especially the British class system. Rigid social barriers existed - and everyone wanted to marry ""up"" to a higher station - and into wealth. This is also a very poignant and passionate tale of love, disappointment, loss and redemption. The point is clearly that one shouldn't ever be persuaded to abandon core values and beliefs, especially for ignoble goals. There are consequences, always.
Sir Walter Elliot, Lord of Kellynch Hall, is an extravagant, self-aggrandizing snob, and a bit of a dandy to boot. He has been a widower for many years and spends money beyond his means to increase his social stature. His eldest daughter, who he dotes on, is as conceited and spoiled as he is. The youngest daughter, Anne (Amanda Root), is an intelligent, sensitive, capable and unassuming woman in her late twenties when the film begins. She had been quite pretty at one time, but life's disappointments have taken their toll and her looks are fading. She and her sister are both single. Anne had once been very much in love with a young, and as yet untried, navel officer. A woman who had been a close friend to Anne's mother, persuaded Anne to call off the engagement, convincing her that she could make a much better match. After much consideration, Anne did not follow her heart or her better instincts, and she and her young officer, Frederick Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds), separated. She has never again found the mutual love or companionship that she had with him.
The Elliot family is forced to financially retrench because of their extravagance. They lease Kellynch Hall to...of all people...Wentworth's sister and her husband. Elliot, his oldest daughter and her companion, move to a smaller lodging in Bath for the season, leaving Anne to pack up their belongings before joining them. She gets the Cinderella treatment throughout the film. Anne chooses this time to visit with her middle sister, an abominably spoiled, whiny hypochondriac, Mrs. Musgrove. She has made a good, but not brilliant match to a local squire. Charles Muskgrove, her husband, his parents, and their two younger, eligible daughters, Louisa and Henrietta, are delightful. There are wonderfully warm scenes of family and friends dining, dancing, hiking over the gorgeous countryside, and at the seashore, that bring the audience smack into early 19th century English life. It is at the Muskgrove estate that Anne meets Frederick Wentworth again, after his absence of seven years. He is in the neighborhood, because his sister is now in the area, residing at Kellynch, of course. Wentworth is now a Captain in the Royal Navy and quite wealthy. When their eyes meet for the first time, you can absolutely feel Anne's longing and remorse. Intense. I cannot imagine a better actress to play Anne than Amanda Root. She slowly transforms herself from a sallow, aging spinster to a luminescent woman in love - and this is Not just the makeup. Wentworth/Hinds is aloof with Anne, although civil. The man was hurtfully rejected once before and it appears that he still feels the sting of her snub. Now Wentworth is on the marriage market and Louisa sets her cap for him. Accidents and various adventures ensue, from the resorts of Lyme and Bath to the Muskgrove estate, bringing Anne and Wentworth closer together. The passion between the two is palpable, although Very understated, (this is Regency England after all). If Ms. Root is the perfect Anne, then Mr. Hinds is the best possible Wentworth. He is as large and virile as she is petite and feminine. He oozes sexuality...but again, he portrays his character with great subtlety. The entire production is brilliantly cast and the acting is superb
I think this is Ms. Austen's most passionate piece. Some scholars say that she modeled Anne Elliot after herself.
This remarkable film, like the novel, and the issues it tackles, is just as germane today as it was when written. Each time I view it, it just gets better. And the romance...well, no one does romance better than Jane Austen.",1055635200,21,4548,4.938642297650131
753342,5,6303965415,"Jane Austen wrote PERSUASION towards the end of her life, while in her final illness. Thus an atmosphere of bending weariness and quiet resignation pervades this tender romance, infused within provincial life in Regency England, swaying against the backdrop of the Napoleonic wars. I could not help but love this BBC film version unconditionally, so deftly are the gentle qualities of the novel brought forth.
As with her earlier novel, MANSFIELD PARK, Austen filled this story with subdued satire - intertwining a comedy of genteel manners with the unassailable decrees of the human heart. This is the story of Anne Elliot (Amanda Root): a single woman in her late 20's who, eight years previous, on the counsel of her patroness and late mother's friend, Lady Russell (Susan Fleetwood-who sadly died of cancer shortly after this film was made), had refused an offer of marriage from her true love, Captain Frederick Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds) on the grounds of his poor financial prospects.
Captain Wentworth returns to Anne's rather confined realm of society when his sister, Mrs. Croft, and her husband, an Admiral in the Navy (John Woodvine, of 1992's WUTHERING HEIGHTS) lease Anne's baronet father's estate, Kellynch Hall. Before she can join her father and elder sister Elizabeth (Phoebe Nicholls) in Bath, she must first spend a few weeks with her hypochondriac younger sister Mary, whose husband Charles' family, the Musgroves - parents Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove, and two younger sisters, Henrietta and Louisa - reside nearby. It is here that Anne becomes re-acquainted with her long-lost love, who's by now an advantageous match for any young woman, having made his prize fortune during the war. Wentworth initially fancies himself ""a lost man"" to the first attractive young lady who bestows upon him her ""compliments to the Navy."" To all appearances, Louisa Musgrove is that very lady...
Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, even though they lack the physical beauty distinctive in other Austen adaptations, express the gamut of suppressed emotions most flawlessly here. Ms. Root conjures all the feelings of empathy and affection with every delicate expression she makes. Mr. Hinds, whom I've seen in a number of other roles -including that of an overwrought Mr. Rochester in a 1997 adaptation of JANE EYRE - gives here what's quite likely the best performance of his career. His Wentworth's subtle yet barely suppressed anger hits Anne like a bombshell. The emotion is slow paced and very flowing - but it's nonetheless quite palpable.
The entire cast, in fact, gives every cause for high praise -- most notably Corin Redgrave (brother of Lynn and Vanessa) as Anne's vain and spendthrift father, Sir Walter Elliot, Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thompson) as Anne's self-centered younger sister Mary Musgrove, and Fiona Shaw (Mrs. Reed in 1996's JANE EYRE) as the indomitable Mrs. Croft - each are absolutely perfect in their respective roles.

Many a time, upon a weekend afternoon, I've placed this tape into my VCR and played it while occupied with various household chores. As ever and as always, this film offers up its many beauties, and they never fail to enchant me: the long walks through the pristine and stately New Forest - the excursions with the Navel men striding proudly along jetties of the shores at Lyme - the atmospheric turns about the drizzly sidewalks, the pump rooms, and the concert halls of Bath. Such are the scenes that eternally soothe a spirit ~",1051228800,847,3475,5.075174825174825
753343,4,6303965415,"""Persuasion"" is not as flashy as the some of the other Jane Austen stories that have been made into movies, but it is so rich and fulfilling to watch that it ranks up there with the best.  It is a definite must-have to round-out your Austen collection--not a waste of money by a long shot.
The overall mood of the film is hushed and a little brooding, but not boring in the least.  A caveat--any Austen fan will certainly endure, but non-Austen companions may not have the patience.  Try having a Jane Austen party with your most refined friends, as this one may not fly with a wood-chopping, motorcycle riding husband or boyfriend.
The camera angles and lighting are reminiscient of other British productions, markedly different from ""American-made"" films. For instance, the rooms are not always well-lit, but this is more realistic to the era of candle-lighting and actually enhances the viewers understanding of the setting.  As well, the camera techniques appear a little distracting to the average viewer, such as remaining fixed upon the actors' faces a little longer than ""American"" films and, but this is useful because it helps the viewer to feel what the characters are feeling.  I'd have to say that this film is shot in a method that is somewhere between a stage-play and a typical movie.
The costumes and settings are authentic and believable.  Every attention has been paid to period details and never does one think that it is all a hoax, I promise.  Nothing is worse than seeing a telephone pole in the background or asphalt roads when you're enjoying a period film!
Amanda Root, who plays the main character of Anne Elliot, is an excellent actress and is very convincing as the broken-hearted spinster whose undeserving family cruelly mistreats her. She has a unique brand of beauty and elegance and pulls off her performance impeccably.
As the story unfolds it seems that Anne is destined to live a lonely life forever, until someone from her past unexpectedly enters the picture.......there are some surprises, but ultimately a satisfying, semi-vengeful ending.  This one makes you think a little more about some of the cruelties of old English noble life and makes you appreciate the freedom to make our own choices in matters of love.",1050710400,7,2255,4.900262467191601
753344,3,6303965415,"PERSUASION is another in a series of film adaptations of Jane Austen novels that take place in the Regency England of the early 1800s, a world where landed gentleman bemoan the fact that they haven't sired sons to inherit the estate, and whose unmarried daughters moon about waiting for well-mannered, moneyed Hunks to come within striking distance.
The lovelorn protagonist in this particular story is Anne Elliot (Amanda Root), the middle daughter of Walter (Corin Redgrave). Anne's mother being dead, the dominant female of Elliot's Kellynch Estate is Elizabeth (Phoebe Nicholls), Anne's older sister, who is becoming a sour and malicious Old Maid. However, Walter is financially strapped and must move the household to Bath, while renting out the Big House to Admiral Croft, since returned to land after the end of the latest squabble with France. While Walter and Elizabeth carriage off to their new digs, Anne visits with her younger sister, the selfish and silly Mary (Sophie Thompson), who's married to the son of another country gentleman, Mr. Musgrove, who himself has two unmarried daughters waiting for Prince Charming. As it so happens, Mrs. Croft (Fiona Shaw) has a brother, Frederick Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds), also in the Royal Navy. Eight years previous, Wentworth, then a junior officer with no financial prospects, and 19-year old Anne had a secret infatuation that ended when the latter reluctantly rejected the former's marriage proposal on the advice of a meddling socialite, Lady Russell (Susan Fleetwood). Wentworth, now holding the rank of Captain and possessing considerable means from the prize ships his command captured in the latest war, is back in town. Will his love affair with Anne be resurrected, or will he be snared by one of the Musgrove sisters? In the meantime, Anne is taking hits from William Elliot, her handsome cousin and heir apparent to Kellynch Estate.
Whew! Have you got all of this written down?
PERSUASION is impeccably acted, costumed and photographed, and, as such, should rightfully be ranked as one of the best of Austen's Big Screen soaps. In my opinion, however, it's flawed as an entertainment vehicle when compared with the recent cinematic versions of EMMA, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, and MANSFIELD PARK. Anne failed to inspire in this viewer the admiration and affection engendered by the heroines of those others, who were individually more clever, more intelligent, more plucky, or more vivacious. Of single women in her position, Anne states, ""We live at home - quiet, confined - and our feelings prey upon us."" Stewing in one's own juice is more like it, and Anne raises this exercise to an art form. Jeez, go out and get a job at Starbuck's already! And, while none of the JA epics are action thrillers by the wildest imagination, PERSUASION moves at a pace akin to rock formation.
Perhaps the most interesting character is Mrs. Croft. At this point in history (1814), the Admiralty apparently had a policy of allowing its warship commanders to take their spouses along on deployments. Thus, the Admiral's wife has seen much of the world, much to the envy of the stay-at-home-and-be-wretched ladies. Unfortunately, Mrs. Croft has too little screen time and makes no effort to impart any wider perspective to sad sack Anne.
I enjoyed PERSUASION to a certain degree for no other reason than it's an excellent period piece, but am thankful that it's the last of the Austen flicks that I'd obligated myself to see.",1050624000,,3492,5.064236111111111
753417,3,6303965415,"First of all, if you haven't read this book, I strongly recommend that you DO NOT see this movie.  I don't think it would give you a very good impression of what is one of my favorite books.  The pacing is wrong, it  manages to jump around and drag on seemingly without going anywhere at the same time.  I also think that they expect you to infer quite a bit about the characters and events prior to the movie, but don't do a very good job of setting them up.  Also, the sound quality of the dialogue isn't very good. Basically, if you don't already care about the characters, you still won't; if you don't already have some idea of the plot, it will be confusing and move incredibly slowly.
If you have already read the book, I would suggest seeing this movie, it is a decent adaptation (not as good as both recent Emmas and the most recent P&P, but to each their own).  As far as I can remember, the two most major changes made were that the alternate ending (Wentworth speaking on the behalf of the Admiral regarding Kellynch) was added, and Mrs. Smith's story was changed to be much, much shorter and more straightforward.  I think that both of these changes worked fairly well.  What I couldn't stand about this version was its drab personality and horrible miscastings.  Ciaran Hinds plays a dull (and unattractive) Capt. Wenworth.  Amana Root is almost always too passive and serious as Anne (why is she such a good companion? why does everyone like her so much?) and spends half the movie staring sad and confused into the camera.  She never gets her second ""bloom"" either.  Mrs. Smith is laughably goofy.  Elizabeth slouches and chews loudly and snorts and isn't at all elegant.  Still, I think the Musgroves and Crofts are played well, as are Harville and Benwick.  Also, the letter scene was completely ruined for me...they both read it aloud, but not perfectly in unison.
Overall, I gave this movie three stars because even though it's not done at all how I picture it, and is very unclear in parts, it still tells the story faithfully for those who have read it, and it's such a great story....for all of its shortcomings I've still seen this 3 times.",1049328000,5,2164,4.541237113402062
753418,3,6303965415,"I am a true Jane Austen lover.  Persuasion is one of her best novels, yet this movie failed to live up to the emotion and feeling of the book.  Amanda Root's portrayal of Anne is insipid and she does little more move around the movie looking pained.  There is no chemistry at all between Anne and Captain Wentworth, and I felt that the pieces where the movie deviated from the story were not only not needed, but poorly done.  Really quite disappointing.",1046563200,6,454,4.5
753419,5,6303965415,"I think this one of the best movies that I have ever seen!  The acting was superb!  It is a long movie, but when I finished the first video, I could hardly get the second one in fast enough.  I just sat enrapt!  I highly recommend.",1045872000,2,231,3.9565217391304346
753420,5,6303965415,"""Persuasion"" is probably one of the most exceedingly brilliant Jane Austen screen adaptations to date. It is the story about a love that has known disappointment and is now quiet, cold and even a little bitter, but has never really died.
The fact that ""Persuasion"" was made on a relatively small budget does not take away from the film. The cinematography is simple and very matter-of-fact which does not outdo the various locations in which the film is set. The main and supporting cast work wonderfully with a magnificant script written by Roger Mitchell. Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds as Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth share a certain chemistry that works terrifically for the emotionally charged scenes which have little to do with dialogue and more to do with stolen glances. Sophie Thompson gives a stand-out performance as Anne's sister, Mary Musgrove, a hypochondriac whom nobody can stand. Her lines flow flawlessly out of her mouth.
Overall I would give ""Persuasion"" five stars. It is a film that requires patience because you'll grow to care so much about Anne and Frederick that it will be hard to wait and see whether or not they come together as they are so obviously meant to. Unlike other Jane Austen screen adaptations such as Sense and Sensibility which is a ""louder"" and more passionate romp through the 1800's (and just as good), everything about Persuasion is very quiet and subtle. The movie relies on the character's silences and facial expressions which often contradict their actions and words, and in doing so have made, overall, a very satisfying love story.",1045353600,2,1587,4.969924812030075
753421,5,6303965415,"Jane Austen is a wonderful writer.  Her stories are just as true today as in her day.  She has a great way of getting her ideas about family & relationship across to the reader with such tact & humor.

753422,5,6303965415,"Jane Austen's wonderful novels have been adapted many times over and many recent adaptations have been excellent. ""Persuasion"" is one of those heartwarming and romantic love stories that you'll want to revisit again and again.
This is a story of Anne Eliott, second daughter to a debt-ridden baronet.  She fell in love with the dashing and handsome Frederick Wentworth at age 19 but was persuaded to break the engagement because of his limited prospects.  She is, after all, from a noble family while he has a far humbler background.
9 years later, Anne is still unmarried and considered a spinster at age 28.  A visit to her younger sister Mary puts her in the path of Frederick - now a successful navy captain.  She discovers that she is still in love with him but he appears civil but cold (not having forgiven her for breaking his heart).
You'll have to watch the movie to find out how it all turns out but I guarantee that you will find this a thoroughly romantic and enjoyable period piece.  The acting is topnotch and it has the high production values that you would find in an A&E or BBC production. If you've read the book, you will find that this adaptation is very faithful to its source.
I would also recommend ""Sense & Sensibility"" (Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet), ""Emma"" (Gwyneth Paltrow) and the fantastic ""Pride and Prejudice"" (Jennifer Ehle, Colin Firth) to round out a great selection of Jane Austen films. Be sure to check out ""Wives and Daughters"" (Justine Waddell, Keely Hawes) for another splendid romantic adaptation (this time from Mrs. Gaskell's early Victorian novel).",1044230400,5,1592,4.816849816849817
753423,5,6303965415,"This movie is one of my Austen's favorite. I should say that, in fact, its completely different from other Austen adaptations but all the same it captures best the character's feelings in the book. Of course is not as so ""dynamic"" as other adaptations but we must understand that this novel is the last one that Jane Austen wrote and is entirely different from the others. Many critics say that this novel was written in a new style and much of the situation and places are highly connected with Austen's own life so involves much more mature emotions ,and if we consider that this is one of the oldest protagonists of  Austen's novel and has suffer a vast deal more than any other character, it is absolutely rational to expect a much more serious movie with deep ""hidden"" feelings in which the audience can understand and connect with Anne's feelings.
I absolutely think that Amanda Root's performance is superior, it has credibility, and most of all she is capable of expressing  the love, and passion that she feels for Cap. Wentworth, and at the same time the pain and suffering that she bestowed all those years , to me she fully represents my idea of Anne Elliot.
Ciaran Hinds its mostly the same, he is wonderful! Everything that a Cap. Wentworth should be. His performance really makes you suffer and love him through the movie with his looks, and at the same time with his indifferences towards Anne. Pitty that the movie does not shows Anne and Wentworth kissing for a longer time !!!!!
To me this movie is one of the greatest adaptations of Austen's novel with P&P, faithfully to the book and intense as the book itself.",1042329600,7,1632,4.643598615916955

753425,2,6303965415,"As a lifelong admirer of Jane Austen's novels, and one who also greatly enjoys the Colin Firth version of Pride and Prejudice, I was looking forward to seeing this video. However Amanda Root's interpretation of Anne is so at odds with my reading of her that it spoiled the film for me. While her depressed and downtrodden demeanor may have been at least somewhat appropriate in the beginning, there was no sign of the remarkably improved features and color that Austen described during the Musgrove party's sojourn at Lyme, and there was nothing in Anne's looks, complexion or expression that would have caused the Walter Elliot character to look at her twice, as the novel demanded. The sprightly personality and sense of humor which is an integral part of the character that Austen created was missing entirely. The director also took too many liberties with Jane Austen's story, having the characters behave in a manner which seems foreign both to the times and to their personalities. I am particularly thinking of the way in which Wentworth announces his intention to marry Anne during the gathering in her father's salon. After seeing this movie I intend to check out the 1971 version, which several reviewers have felt was far more faithful to Jane Austen's. And after all, that's why most of us want to view it.",1041379200,33,1319,4.866666666666666
753426,5,6303965415,"Oh yes, this is my kind of movie!! It is a film that requires your complete attention to the actors on the screen; you've got to pay close attention to them because there is not any overt display of feelings/emotions until the very end of the movie. No chewing of the scenery--just superb acting! The eyes of Amanda Root and Ciarian Hinds (as Anne and Captain Wentworth) express a world of emotions--they simply speak volumes. There is not a great deal of ""physical action"" in this film. On the surface, everthing is sooooooo proper, refined and controlled; however, there's ""loads"" going on emotionally inside the characters and that is expressed completely through the actors' eyes and facial expressions. Amanda Root and Ciarian Hinds performances just blew me away! If you are not watching Root's eyes (as Anne) when she first sees Captain Wentworth, you will miss completely what he has meant to her, what he still means to her and what the movie is about--it's all portrayed in her eyes. Ciarian Hinds, as Captian Wentworth, at first keeps ""his cool"" doing the macho thing and not giving the audience a hint of what Anne has meant and stills means to him. But watch that facade start to crumble--again portrayed in his eyes. Some reviewers on this board find Hinds' portrayal of the captain as too distant and cold. I don't. Remember, he was the one rejected by Anne and, to me, he's putting on that ""I'll show her"" routine. But as I previously stated that soon changes and you really find out how much he still loves her.
I just love acting of this caliber. For me, you can forget the actors that chew up scenery. Give me the ones that can stun you with their depth of emotion and feeling through subtle means of expression--Amanda Root and Ciarian Hinds are such actors. In fact, everyone, in Persuasion, gives superb performances!
If you are into wonderful acting, buy this film!",1041292800,12,1888,4.724242424242425
753497,3,6303965415,"Evidently, to love this adaptation,  it helps if you're a Hinds fan. I'm not, which partly explains why I'm not satisfied by it. I say this as someone who has read all six novels and who enjoys almost all of the adaptations, including the old BBC ones.
I picture Wentworth as a livelier, younger-seeming man, a smile never far away. Someone you'd enjoy being around. Hinds' portrayal is rather dour, even cold. In the scene at the Bath concert, where Anne's cousin is paying her attentions, Anne practically begs him to stay, but he is cold to the point of humiliation. Sorry, at that point I wouldn't care if he came back or not.
Amanda Root would not be my first choice for Anne. I pictured her as a bit more elegant and poised. However, I did like her better with repeated viewing.
It's a fairly small budget production, and for some reason they often shot in small, cramped, dark locations. I believe this was to give it a realistic feel, but it only succeeded in contributing to a dark, claustrophobic mood.
One other (small) criticism I had was the scene with Lady Dalrymple and her daughter. It was over the top. Lady Dalrymple especially looked like she belonged in an opium den. I guess it was supposed to be humorous, but it gave me the creeps. The point of those characters was to satirize wealth, connection and snobbery. It seemed pointless to make them so weird.
So, on the whole, I would watch other Austen adaptations before this one. I think the definitive Persuasion is still to be made. A note on the book: it is one of the most accessible of all the six novels, and I recommend reading it.",1039564800,3,1609,4.510273972602739

One sister pretends to be sick when she's bored with her children and husband, but still manages to eat like there's no tomorrow! Her other sister is more concerned with the latest in marzipan, than she is in anything else.
There's other stuff going on, intrigue, romance and the beautiful English countryside. The characters spring from Austen's book and if you like Jane Austen, you'll certainly appreciate this British version of Persuasion.",1037750400,2,679,4.956140350877193

Storyline:
(Past story) Rich Girl meets Navy Boy, they fall in love. Nosy stepmother-figure decides he's not good enough for her little angel; Girl dumps Boy.
(Movie, present time) Eight years later, Wentworth returns a wealthy Man.  Anne, now extremely pale(someone throw a little sunshine her way) and unwanted, is forced into a re-acquaintance when spendthrift effeminate father has to lease family mansion to Wentworth's relations. She's packed off to her married sister's place while daddy and the beloved sister waltz their way to Bath.
Anne spends the next forever (7? 8? hours) moping around while Wenworth makes a play for an empty-headed cheerleader-type. Cheerleader throws herself off a walkway for the joy of it and Anne takes control while everyone else goes into hysterics. Wentworth (suddenly looking at Anne in a whole new way and realising that maybe the dominatrix fantasies aren't out of the cards with English women after all) runs for it while the girlfriend's unconscious. Anne returns to her father (in Bath), and surprise, surprise, but Wentworth appears soon after. Man and Woman are reduced to Boy and Girl again while they tiptoe around the fact that they're itching for a shag. But life ends happily and all is well; boy and girl settle for a public kiss (scandalous stuff) and riding off into the sunset on the trusty horse.....er, ship.
Personal impression: Book was better. Movie went too long, and this is coming from someone who fell in love with the 1996 version of Pride and Prejudice, which has 2 tapes and goes for longer than Gone With the Wind.
I made the mistake of watching the movie before the book. Don't. If you're going to watch the movie, read first so that you'll understand all the little nuances that don't really explain themselves. Overall, I've seen better, but also worse.",1036800000,6,1829,4.957654723127036

753501,4,6303965415,"""Persuasion"" is one of Jane Austen's loveliest tales! Indeed, one full of hope and second chances. I think everyone can relate in one way or another, because we all have made decisions (which later we discovered were actually MISTAKES!) that were partly based on outside influences and opinions, and have lived to regret them. :`(
This is precisely the case with sweet-tempered Anne Elliot (Amanda Root), a not-so-young woman in her late twenties, who chose (in her younger years, when she was about nineteen) not to marry the man she truly loved, Frederick Wentworth, because he was thought to be ""unsuitable"" (by some anyway), for no other reason than his lack of fortune and connections! He was just a sailor, with nothing to offer- if LOVE and COMMITMENT are nothing (gee! the English were really shallow!). Her young, inexperienced heart was led, or ""persuaded"" if you will, to believe that his seeming lack of position in society would interfere with her happiness, and that opinion, which was not her own, no doubt contributed to her decision to turn down his proposal. As the years fly by, Anne is left to bear the burden of her choice. In her household she is made to feel less than appreciated, considered by this time to be an ""old maid"", she is not thought to be as pretty as her sister Elizabeth, and is generally neglected by her father (her mother died). Add to that, the fact that her family is teeter-tottering on the edge of financial ruin, and Anne has quite a load to bear! All her hope of finding happiness, love and contentment, is seemingly dead until... the once ""unsuitable"" sailor returns (this is eight years later mind you) as a Captain, of rather large fortune I might add! Captain Frederick Wentworth, charmingly played by Ciaran Hinds (gotta LOVE Ciaran!). He is yet unmarried, and is quite dashing, quite the talk of the town, quite the gentleman. As you can imagine, plenty of YOUNG ladies (younger, fresher than Anne) are more than willing to become Mrs. Wentworth. Could Anne be a consideration still? At her age? With their history? Just as Wentworth reappears in her life, and she is forced to look her past straight in the face, another man, young, handsome, seemingly wealthy Mr. Elliot (her cousin) also appears, and takes an interest in Anne! (When it rains it pours, huh!?) Could it be Mr. Elliot is right for her?
Ah, and here's where second chances come into play. What to do? What to do? Is it possible Wentworth could still love her after so many years? She has certainly never forgotten him. Could it be that her heart which was once ""persuaded"" to let him go, could now be ""persuaded"" to reach out to him again? Would HE be receptive after being rejected so many years ago, by the one he truly loved? Could he be ""persuaded"" to forgive her? Wouldn't YOU like to know? You have to see the movie! I won't give it away. But, let me just say it is quite rewarding, because too often in life (and even in movies/books too I suppose) those worthy of second chances do not get them, or, they are too blinded to recognize them when they come back around. Even worse, they may be too hesitant to go for it when they do recognize! Love though, ""persuades"" us to do what we never thought possible! It emboldens us, encourages us, and pushes us to go after our dreams!
To be honest, parts of the film are a tad... well, dull, but the overall theme, the storyline, allows you to endure them in order to see the outcome. Ciaran Hinds, and Amanda Root have a good chemistry. So often in the movie Anne has this wide-eyed, ""I think I'm about to faint"" expression on her face whenever she sees/talks to Wentworth... it is quite funny to see. And Wentworth's stares are enough to make any woman feel that way! This is a beautifully done adaptation, and you can't help but adore Ciaran Hinds! ""Persuasion"" is the perfect name for this story, because though our thoughts and opinions, and as a result our actions, can be influenced by others, it is really the heart that is the most persuasive influence! Really, each person must decide for THEMSELVES what is best and right for them. Love is never of little importance, but of the GREATEST, and a heart that has known true love will be persuaded to seek it again! All-in-all this movie is great! Why rent it when you can own it? I hope I have persuaded you (pun intended) to do so. Enjoy!! :-)",1032480000,10,4372,4.58492975734355

There is much more realism as far as daily life and class issues than in a movie that is more glammed up like Thompson's Sense and Sensibility. They are both great to watch, but this one is for the more sophisticated viewer rather than the one who doesn't know or care who Jane Austen is. People complain that Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are not ""beautiful"" enough but that isn't the point (and they are very appealing in anycase-just not a Kate Winslet or Colin Firth). The point is, they depict the tension and longing so well that even if you are romantically inept you should feel this anticipation and desire. And actually C.Hinds is very handsome and strong and Root is rightly understated but pretty. There attraction is very subtle on one level but palpable if you pay attention.

I don't understand why people have problems with the cast, the story, or the music.  The leads are definitely not the regular Hollywood types, but that only makes them that much more believable.  I think this production is the finest showing of ensemble acting I've seen.  The script is a rather faithful rendering of Austen's novel (e.g., 90% of the dialogue comes straight from the book) and so I don't understand why some people say that they like Persuasion, the novel, but find problems with this part or that part of the story of the movie.  And the music is by the Romantic period composer, Chopin -- enough said.
This is not a movie to watch just once.  In this regard, it's like a book.  I watched it several times before I was able to pick up on how effectively the relationship between Anne and Frederick is juxtaposed against the various other relationships in the movie.
I read the novel subsequent to watching the movie, and I found no jarring differences in the stories of the two mediums, with the exception of Mr. Elliot and Mrs. Smith.  The book presents Mr. Elliot far more critical light.  And I think Austen's alternate ending was very well integrated into the movie.  The brains behind the movie really did their homework in selecting the cast and condensing the novel to a script that still retains much of the nuances of the novel.",1024531200,9,1624,4.63986013986014
753587,5,6303965415,"...and even when ""Persuasion"" first came out, I watched it three times in the movie theater.  It is like reading any Jane Austen novel -- no matter how many times you read one, you can reread it and enjoy it all over again...and again.  It is amazing to watch Amanda Root as Anne actually bloom -- you can even see the color come back to her cheeks when she gets to Lyme and gets a taste of the sea air.  Even the problems I used to have with this adaptation have worn away:  I didn't like the way they tried to incorporate both the unfinished 10th chapter and the final version of the novel with Capt. Wentworth's confronting Anne about her supposed engagement...but now I like seeing the opportunity to have the Captain and Lady Russell confront each other; I didn't like the way Anne rushes to Capt. Wentworth in front of the whole concert audience as they watch...but now I like seeing just how little she cared about others' opinions and how impulsive she becomes toward the end of the movie; I didn't like how they emphasize Mr. Elliot and Mrs. Clay's complicity...but now after thinking about it, this *is* implied strongly in the novel.  One of the best parts of the movie, however, are the significant looks exchanged between Anne and Capt. Wentworth -- one of the best happening when Anne is discussing love and loss with Capt. Benwick.  It is so subtle but so heavy with meaning.  It is not so surprising to me to find out that both Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds have acted with the Royal Shakespeare Company as they both do superb jobs here.",1024185600,7,1552,4.501779359430605

The settings, on the beach, at Lime, or in Bath are particularly interesting.

But as the movie progresses they continually meet up with each other. When it is announced that she is to marry another she is outraged at the rumors and soon the characters rediscover what love and confusion are all about.

753592,3,6303965415,"Don't let my rating of 3 stars mislead anyone...this is a good movie. There is no fault to be found with the story line. The movie sticks fairly close the the original Jane Austen novel, while taking a few, acceptable, creative liscences with the plot. It is wonderfully cast (almost perfectly cast to be precise) and it is shot beutifully. The scenery is inspiring and the costumes are elegant without being overdone. However, I have some complaints about the quality of this production...needless to say, this story deserved better then what was done to it. First of all, the story starts so slow that I could barely keep my interest (I find this a screenplay error, the original novel doesn't start out so dully and slowly). Luckily, the plot picks up after about half an hour and the rest of the story was wonderful, romatic, and interesting. Secondly, the sound on the entire procuction is terrible. In almost every key point in the plot I had to turn the volume to the maximum just to try and hear what the characters were saying, and even then I could barely understand them. During the climax of the movie, which involves one of the most moving and romantic love letters ever written, two voices read it at the same time, making the letter incomprehensible. I had to rewind the video and watch it at least three times before I understood what the letter even said...poorly done. For a movie where dialogue is the driving force for the movie more attention should have been given to sound quality.  The good news is that I was at least interested enough in the movie to be drawn into reading the book, which was a million times better and a lot more interesting so I must give that credit where credit is due. My basic opinion of this movie is that it was a good idea and well done from the standpoint of the story, but more time should have been given to certain production details. The lack of such attention only frustrated me as a viewer when it was clear the movie was a good one.",1017964800,7,1992,4.518005540166205

After watching the DVD, I must say that I am still unsatisfied with the performance by the leading actress Amanda Root. As many reviewers have said before, she's totally unattractive no matter it's in the beginning or in the end where some reviewers have said that she has ""blossomed"" or ""transformed"". Beside her apparance, her acting skill was not impressive, either. She just had her eyes wide open at almost every shot. As to Capt. Wentworth played by Ciaran Hinds, I have to say that he's totally charming and handsome. He steals the show. Whenever he appeared in any scene he's the focus. No question asked. I love watching Jane Austin's movies very much. I have BBC's Pride and Prejudice, BBC's Emma, Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility and I just need to add the Persuasion to my collection. The story itself was extremely romantic. The casting and the set are wonderful, too. However, I just can't help but wandering if Anne Elliot was portrayed by a slightly younger, more eye-pleasing actress, then this movie might have been my favorite Jane Austin movie of all time.

There was no good music in the background, not a significant, good amount of development about Anne and Wentworth's feelings.  Lady Russell was cast badly as well.  This isn't just a biased opnion, i'm sure many people would agree if they saw this movie just how badly it was cast and that the actors just ruined the beautiful story.",1013990400,16,566,4.755102040816326
753669,2,6303965415,"I'm afraid I must agree with arabellafig. It isn't exactly poorly done, but it could be far far better, and suffers badly from comparison with Emma Thompson's ""Sense & Sensibility"" and of course with A&E's exquisite ""Pride & Prejudice"" but it could be far, far better. I too had high hopes after reading so many glowing reviews, the story will always be memorable, but it is almost a filmed version of Cliff's Notes on Austen's original tale. It runs 104 minutes to S&S 136 to P&P's 6 volume set. Why? Perhaps it was designed around television commercial space.
What particularly grated was the casting and much direction which was strangely off. The eldest sister Elizabeth is pissy and crude although she has been in charge of Sir Walter's social responsibilities and second only to him in ""precedence"" since her mother's death. It is not necessary to have her slouch in a chair and throw papers about in a pout to establish her character as a bad egg. Neither one, especially Ann, is believable as daughter of nobility and the upper class. Ann in particular clomps about clumsily, starts, scuttles, and hides. One can hardly imagine her daring to give an order to anyone (other than calling for a doctor after Louisa's fall) although giving orders to servants is her station in life. The very elegant and lovely and believable Lady Russell has been her close companion and surrogate mother since Ann lost her own mother at 14 - and this is the result? Compare to Lady Russell herself, to the S&S apparently lower ranking Eleanor Dashwood (Emma Thompson) saying her farewells to the servants or the elegant creature who Marianne Dashwood discovers to be her replacement, or to P&P Elizabeth and Jane Bennet. Rather than an image of a Lady of gentle quietness, forebearance and resignation, she seems more a scared rabbit. I could see her in the role of the starting, clomping, bewildered maid in P&P being ordered to stop working on Lizzy's hair and attend to Miss Jane. She does the staring traumatized eyes quite well however, so they are featured in nearly every scene. The hypochondriac youngest daughter Mary is well acted - but she even seems older than Ann.
What is NOT featured is any kind of dialogue that would establish the character that is claimed for her. We have only the doormat behavior to establish deference to others; the blandishments of the scheming Mr. Elliott on skill at Italian; the final speech overheard by Capt. Wentworth. We should be allowed to see more of her than what is filtered through her blind and belittling family, not less.
P&P actually added character development - for example, not until the scene at the Rosings pianoforte did it occur to me that part of Mr. Darcy's problem just might be that he is as naturally shy as his sister, or why Georgiana had specifically NOT been entrusted to the tender care of Lady Catherine. Edward in S&S was beautifully developed through Margaret's Atlas (in a wonderful scene that does not exist in the book).
I don't suppose I will never ever watch it again, but it has sent me back to re-read the novel. A good thing, that, as is the reminder that a wonderful story does not automatically make a wonderful movie all on its own - and the critical impact of good direction, the overall artistry of casting, lighting, staging, landscape. One of the things I love about DVDs (such as S&S) is the opportunity to listen to scene commentary by the actors and directors, to understand how very much goes into the making of a good or great film, how little into poor or merely adequate ones.",1012521600,18,3564,4.731511254019293
753670,4,6303965415,"If the pleasures of tea, a letter from a friend, sparkling oceans and ships appeal to you, this movie will be a delight. From the sunlit kitchen tables to the birds chirping at the country estates, you will find the atmosphere and sound very realistic.

This is the story of two people seeking a second chance at happiness and almost seeming to pass by one another like two ships in the night. Neither is willing to say what they are feeling as both are still emotionally distraught from their unfortunate breakup.

Anne (Amanda Root) is an angel of mercy to everyone around her. She not only provides care, she also seems to be everyone's confidante. In her eyes we see her own private torture, which she tries to hide at all costs. She feels that perhaps she made a mistake in rejecting the love of Capt. Wentworth (Ciarn Hinds), who could not provide for her financially at the time. When he appears in her life again, she fears she may lose him forever.

Her own family has gone in various directions due to their own financial difficulties. She is burdened with guilt and financial worries. At first she is shy and melancholy and then when she realizes love may again be within her reach, she blossoms into a beautiful woman who knows exactly what she wants.

The temptation at the start of this movie is to just stop the tape and rewind. However, something in the story kept me watching and the conclusion was very worthwhile. The story is not complex, yet the finer details are worth following and are at times very amusing. Some of the dialogue is so wonderful you have to rewind just to listen to it again!

Mr. Elliot: ""Good company is always worth keeping.""
Anne: ""My idea of good company, Mr. Elliot, is the fellowship of clever, well-informed people who have a great deal of conversation and a liberality of ideas. That is what I call good company.""
Mr. Elliot: ""That is not good company. That is the best.""

Or when Mr. Elliot is trying to seduce Anne into marrying him he tries to work his way into her heart with some blandishment and yet Anne is only engaging in a casual dalliance.

Anne: ""You presume to know me very well, Mr. Elliot""
Mr. Elliot: ""In my heart...I know you...intimately.""

A relaxing, beautiful and contemplative movie
you can enjoy on a cold day with a pot of tea and some
heart shaped shortbread cookies.

Dreadfully Romantic!

It's the story of a young woman who, at the urging of her family and a close family friend, spurned the love of her life.  8 years later she's still regretting it when he reappears in her life.  Resigned to a life of spinsterhood by her family, she becomes nearly invisable to those around her while her former love is exhaulted for his prowess in the intervening years.  Now highly eligible, Anne must watch as he seemingly courts others while her heart breaks again.
But all is not as it seems in this slow moving drama.  And when the twist of another suitor turns the tables, who is it that is really the broken hearted one?  Anne?  Or her beloved Captain Wentworth?  And who is this Mr Elliot that suddenly shows such interest?
Stick with it through the end.  Then watch it again.  You'll fall in love over and over again.  A brilliant piece that makes your heart sigh at the end.  I give it my highest rating.",1009929600,4,1097,4.344827586206897
753672,2,6303965415,"I was thouroughly dissapointed with this film.  I had very high hopes going into it, especially after reading so many glowing reviews.  Jane Austen is my all-time favorite author and Sense and Sensibility is my all-time favorite film.  As I excitedly opened the box and popped the DVD into my machine I was all a flutter, but as the movie progressed my enthusiasm quickly diminished, and until the terribly wrong ending I still had hopes that it could redeem itself.
I must admit that the acting was good, but the casting (Anne's father being an exception) was all wrong to me.  It seems like they took a crop of well-known, critically-acclaimed British actors and made them fit into the parts, whether they looked and felt right for them or not.  It may be that I'm used to hollywoody pretty people, so I probably could have excused this point if it weren't for the fact that the score was dissapointing and the adaptation was terribly wrong.  Why is it that screenwriters feel they have to make the characters say and do things that Austen would never have made them say and do in order to relate to present-day audiences?  This was a big problem in the recent Mansfield Park as well.  The screenwriter remained faithful to the book in parts where it caused the film to drag and deviated when a faithful adaptiation would've shone.  The ending was the worst example of this, though I will not elaborate for those who are planning to see it.
As I said, Sense and Sensibility is my favorite film of all time, and unarguably the perfect Jane Austen adaptation.  If only Emma Thompson would write all of Austen's novels!  Although she didn't copy the novel exactly, one would never know it.  It deviates from the text but still remains faithful to Austen's style and spirit.  Not once do the characters kiss or embrace, but it is still extremely moving and completely romantic, not to mention beautifully directed by Ang Lee.  I highly recommend Sense and Sensibility on DVD if one is looking for an Austen fix.
Persuasion, on the other hand, was very painful for me, especially as it is my favorite of Austen's novels.  It nearly destroyed the novel for me.  I still have to concentrate very hard to picture the characters as I originally envisioned them.  I wish I had never seen it.  It also has made me reluctant to see other film adaptations of her work.  I am itching to watch the BBC/A&E miniseries of Pride and Prejudice, but I am afraid that it will be just as bad, despite all the good reviews I see.  I relied too heavily on the good reviews I read for Persuasion.
I may be too critical, or maybe just crazy.  So far I am the only one I know who disliked it so much.  Still, I dissuaded my mom seriously from watching this movie and I would caution others to watch at your own risk.  You may think it is wonderful, but I didn't.",1009756800,12,2837,4.519607843137255

When I saw it in DVD it was an easy decision to add this to a collection worth archiving.  The DVD is far superior in audio quality to the VHS.

It is a sweet story of a ""spinster"" who is forced to bypass two offers of marriage by an interferring socialite neighbor who has placed herself in the advisor role since the death of the girl's mother.  Ann Elliott is pale, withdrawn and very sad as she watches her life pass her by, lost in regrets over refusing the hand of a man she truly loved.  The socialite wants her to marry a cousin who has another agenda entirely.
The story unfolds as her lost love, Captain Wentworth, reappears in her life and one watches a very gifted actress, who is a member of the Royal Shakespearean Theater in England, literally come to life again as she reawakens to the love lost and the promise to regain it.

753763,5,6303965415,"Who could fail to be moved by this subtle adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Persuasion""? Of all the Jane Austen features of the last six years or so, this is my personal favorite; in fact, it's one of my ten most favorite movies. It has an intimate feel to it that the other films, good though they are, lack. A wonderful example of this is the scene at the Great House, where the characters are assembled for a dinner given by the Musgroves. The flickering of the candles and the low ceilings convey a gathering where good conversation among genial people flourishes, somewhat reminiscent of ""Babette's Feast"".
""Persuasion"" concerns Anne Elliot and her lost love, Captain Wentworth. Eight years before the start of the picture, she had refused his marriage proposal, having been persuaded by a family friend that it would be an unsuitable match. Anne, you see, is the daughter of a baronet, while Edward is of no particular lineage. During these years, she has lost both her spirits and her looks, we are told. Then, chance brings Edward back into her life, but as the suitor of a family friend, a much younger woman who is quite vivacious--and he bears a grudge against Anne for her lack of personal conviction. Like all Jane Austen novels, the story then hinges upon whether a hopeless romantic situation can be brought round to our satisfaction.

753765,4,6303965415,"First let me state the obvious: I am a fan of Jane Austen, and have been for 30 years.  Secondly, let me state that the first viewing of this adaptation had all the charm of an impacted wisdom tooth.  Unless you are well acquainted with the story, you will be monumentally confused the first time you see it.  This is not a film you can go into blind, because it won't give you any help with what is going on. Oh how the British  love the device of implication and assumed history.  Neither will be much help in understanding this.  The people that I watched this with found it extremely confusing and discordant, and I did too, even though I have read the book many times over the years.  Most of my audience kept complaining that the people looked too British.  If ever there were a cast of singularly unattractive people, this is it.  Anne Elliot looks not so much faded, as enbalmed and brought back from the dead for this performance and I found Frederick Wentworth podgy, buck toothed and very unappealing.  And those were his good points.  This film is chock full of people who seem able to vent with great abandon unless honesty would clear everything up in two seconds flat.  At which times they look tortured and constipated.  The director and writer also saw fit to change things from the book, and none of the adaptations were an improvement.
  Having slammed their physical appearance, I must say that the people in Hollywood would have cast actors with physical appeal and no substance.  The British cast on the basis of talent, and even if the actors are not particularly handsome, they grow on you.  I can not think of one person who did not do a very good job,  and although I found Anne and Frederick's tortured looks, gaping, gawking, and inability to communicate, extremely irritating, I am inclined to blame the director more than the actors.  Captain Benwick was very good, but he reminded me of the Pillsbury Doughboy playing dress-up.  Anne's eldest sister, Elizabeth, was shrill, annoying and petulantly unattractive.  In short, perfect for the part.  The murkiness and evocative moods, reminded me of Wuthering Heights meets Frederico Fellini.  Brooding and bizarre.
  If you can over-look dentition, physicality, and mood swings, you will like this movie.  It has a certain  jarring charm, mostly superb acting, interesting wardrobe, and it is unpretentious.  It doesn't care whether you like it or not.  I did, and although my daughter will not watch it with me, my husband very much enjoyed it, and he has watched it with me more than once.  This is the only  Persuasion that I could find, and if you can overlook some things, you will find yourself drawn to it again and again.  The ending is not what I would have done, nor do people in Austen novels kiss on the streets of Bath. In the book, Anne did not seem as wimpy and  irksome as in this.  I frequently wanted to slap her. Hard.",1001980800,5,2915,4.6399217221135025
753766,5,6303965415,"This 1995 adaptation of Jane Austen's novel is subtle and understated and simply superb.  Amanda Root is a perfect Anne Elliott; faded and overlooked at the beginning.  You can see just how much she's let herself go, even with the stooped stature and limp hair.  And you feel the mortification, along with her, when her former fiance, Capt. Wentworth, dashingly played by Ciaran Hinds, sees her in this state.
The movie does move rather slowly, but this is it's power.  Even the score of piano music by Chopin conveys how slowly and heavily the time has moved for Anne.  And once you see the transformation that occurs, physically, for Anne, it's even easier to understand how re-awakened hope has transformed her spiritually.
One big difference is the director's use of BOTH the endings Austen wrote to illustrate Frederick's dilemma.  And the ending is one of the most romantic scenes I've ever watched.
I highly recommend it to devotees of Jane Austens's work.",999388800,4,963,4.91358024691358

Persuasion is one of the few Jane Austen novels I read before I saw the movie, and I'm glad I did, because I think the movie may have been a bit slow (I know it was for friends who had not read the book). But I enjoyed this video adaptation, particularly the haunted looks between Amanda Root and Ciaron Hinds (Amanda's eyes reminded me so much of Emily Watson's) and the camera shots of his hands while helping her in the carriage, or her fingers tightening when she was nervous upon their first encounter after 8 years of separation gave a sense of urgency and repressed feelings that I absolutely ate up.

She appears to bloom when she gets to Bath and by the end of the film she radiates.

Hinds' depiction of Captain Wentworth had so much eviction and passion - he was extraordinary and Amanda Root - however not my favourite for the part, enacted it remarkably well. The chemistry between the two were amazing. This was aided greatly by Roger Michell's camera angles and lighting effects - he generously captured all the correct emotions that Austen expressed in her novel with such subtlety & perfection. I also particularly enjoyed the character portrayals of Lady Russell, Mrs Croft, Captain Harville and Elizabeth...Mary was a bit over the top but still satisfactory. However, as `Persuasion' is one of favourite Austen novels, I was immensely disappointed by the fact that vital dialogues were inadmissably overlooked, especially in the final scenes - you just cannot change the ending.

She played her character as so annoying I just couldn't stand her! And Amanda Root transforms just as I imagined she would in the book.

753970,4,6303965415,"Much of the praise given to this movie is deserved. The acting is uniformly excellent. Indeed, every character, excepting none, is carefully etched and individuality drawn. To name a few: Ciaran Hinds as Wentworth, Sophie Thompson as the ever-complaining, self absorbed sister Mary, Corin Redgrave as the narcissistic, snobbish aristocrat Sir Walter Elliot,  Susan Fleetwood as the a sympathetic, but still classist Lady Russell, Richard McCabe as a falsely fragile, introspective Captain Benwick, Samual West as scheming, polished, pretty boy scoundrel; also, with the reservation noted below, Amanda Root as Anne Elliot.

The period is superbly portrayed.  The attitudes about society, class, and birth rights being almost incomprehensible by modern mores are made tangibly credible.  The costumes, personal appearance, and grooming all accurately show Eighteenth century England, a time quite different from our own.  People, even upper class people, sweat, sometimes wear dirty cloths, are not always perfectly shaven, don't always have straight teeth and show real emotions and human variation, not to say faults.  Eighteenth century Europe's detailed and steeply declinated social stratification is magnificently, though incidentally, portrayed.

Granted Mr. Elliot's motivation and behavior are under explained, but this is a minor flaw.

So what is really wrong with the movie?  It is just not believable that a homely, reserved, and wilted Anne Elliot could attract or re-attract the dynamic and successful Captain Wentworth.  Amanda Root, being limited by her inherent appearance and personality, may have done a less than optimal job, but I cannot think of any actress who could have made credible that hansom, rich, self assured Wentworth would be attracted to this mouse in the corner.  Perhaps the fault is with Jane Austen's plot.  Perhaps when she wrote the character of Anne Elliot, Jane was indulging in a bit of wishful thinking motivated by her own romantically unfulfilled life.

But I liked it and having seen it several times, have come to accept the improbability of Wentworth's continued attraction to Root's Anne Elliot.  Certainly stranger things have happened.",981504000,2,2188,5.551204819277109

753972,5,6303965415,"I absolutely adore this film.  I had never read the book and I didn't know the story, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie-- almost as much as Pride and Prejudice!  As with all of Jane Austen's works, I could barely keep up with the names of the people and families involved in the story, which is imperative to understanding the story as it unfolds, so pay close attention to the names of the characters as they come into the film.  Amanda Root does a splendid job of playing Anne, who is not a traditional beauty, but who is loved by several men for her intensity, intelligence, and of course her golden heart.  Ciaran Hinds stole my heart!  When he confessed that his love for Anne had never died, I was jumping up and down with happiness.  Or perhaps it was jealousy...  He is handsome and, of course, a perfect gentleman.  The characters we love to hate also get the chance to spice up this story.  Anne's father is terrible.  He only cares about appearances.  He endlessly talks about the women and men of his acquaintance and all of their physical flaws.
The costumes, old-fashioned homes, and acting in this film are all superb.  I liked this movie even better the second time through, probably because I could associate each character more readily with his or her name.  Rumors and gossip make so much more sense when you know who people are talking about...  I loved this movie because it made my heart leap for joy as Anne and Captain Wentworth fell in love all over again, and I also loved it because Anne was so easy to love as a character.",978134400,8,1552,4.476868327402135
753973,5,6303965415,"Funnily enough Persuasion, Austen's final completed work, and the only one really linked to the Napoleonic Wars, was the only book she wrote in peacetime. Just a snippet of odd gossip which has nothing to do with this movie adaptation - which I loved.
Amanda Root was just perfect as Anne Elliot, the woman who had followed the good advice of her friend some seven years before and refused to marry a suitor without many prospects - Captain Wentworth. By sheer coincidence he returns to the neighbourhood with his sister and her husband. Partly to show Anne what a fool she has been in the past he starts seriously flirting with her two sisters-in-law (the sisters of her wife's brother) however it takes a near disaster to show that their feelings for one another haven't changed. Root plays Anne in beautifully - she is quiet, subdued, yet there is an elegance to her, and slowly her bloom returns.
I also really liked the production - the cinematography struck me as less colourful and bouyant than other recent Austen films (Emma, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility) - in fact the skies often feel low, or crowded with clouds, the costumes dark and rooms not quite so brightly lit. Well until Anne gets to Bath that is where her father's extravagance seems to be shown in endlessly bright rooms. I really liked the production but I know that some people found them too authentic to be really enjoyable - things like hair being not quite clean or the small dark and rather claustrophobic rooms at Lyme. It is definitely a matter of taste.

Never have I seen a movie adaptation that was so right on with every step it takes. Beginning with the casting, (which is superb, from the leads down to the one-liners) and continuing through the script, direction, and acting, this movie never misses. If you're a lover of the book, you'll love this masterful adaptation. The writer includes just the right parts and leaves out just enough. The meticulous attention to REAL period detail ( only candlelight at night, characters with a limited number of items in their wardrobe, period faces unadorned with modern makeup, etc.) sink you wholly into Austen's world. This is not a movie that shows off it's period finery, and that's as it should be. Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds might as well have been born to play these roles. Anne reading Wentworth's letter at the end of the film is so romantic that it still makes me nearly swoon when I watch it. (You listen to Ciarin Hinds say ""You pierce my soul"" and see if you don't feel the same). This film was so successful, that evertime I re-read the book now, I hear those voices and see those faces in my head. Truly one of the most underrated and best films I've ever seen.",976320000,18,1446,4.399253731343284
753975,5,6303965415,"Yet another wonderful version of a Jane Austen novel.  In response to the person who suggested that some of the Austen movies are just costume fests (Emma)I must say that the tone of the novel and film of Emma is much different than Persuasion.  Emma was written to comment on the idea of social class, is about a silly girl, and is firmly tongue in cheek.  It is a sunny novel and therefore a sunny film.  Sense and Sensibility is a darker film and more resembles the film Persuasion in tone.  The tension in S and S is how will this mother and her three daughters find happiness.  In Persuasion the tension is how will these two lovers reconcile and get back together?  As far as Wentworth appearing in a non-uniform in his first scene, why not?  It is not the captain's uniform that attracts Anne, it is the man himself.  The Navy is the only way she can keep track of him. As an American I enjoy seeing these Brit actors in other films--Amanda Root as Miss Temple in William Hurt's Jane Eyre, the brother in law in An Ideal Husband, and Ciaran Hinds in any  number of films such as The Man Who Cried (with Amanda Root.) I enjoy the work of these fine actors.  Thanks for a great film.",974073600,2,1188,4.306306306306307

He was awkward in the beginning because he was knocked for a loop because... well, I won't give it away but you find out later why he was off kilter.

Very atmospheric, with wind swept images of the English coast, and the dripping dreariness of Bath in the winter. Plus, their skirts actually get dirty!  Also, I'm hard pressed to think of another film with such edge-of-your-seat romantic tension. And Captain Wentworth, played by Irishman Cairan Hinds is the ultimate Knight In Shining Armour(!).
The BBC's ""Pride and Prejudice"" six part miniseries is divine too.  With Colin Firth as a smoldering and dreamy Mr. Darcy, and Jennifer Ehle as the lovely Miss Bennet, with terrific supporting cast. Fun, funny and lovely to look at.",973036800,2,712,5.068376068376068
753978,5,6303965415,"""Persuasion"" is Jane Austen's most romantic and most overheated novel, which admittedly isn't to say that it's exactly ""Wuthering Heights"" - but it does carry a stronger emotional undertow than any of her others.  As such, it also makes for a great movie.
It was also her last novel, and if you want to be crudely autobiographical about it, it's a rather wistful revenge fantasy.  Anne Elliot, the only decent and sensible member of the cringingly awful Elliot family, has been fading into regretful spinsterhood ever since she refused marriage to a handsome Navy officer seven years earlier.  Now that her mother is dead and her snobbish roue of a father down on his luck, the family has to rent out the ancestral home (oh, the shame) to a crinkly, friendly Admiral, whose wife happens to be the sister of the man she turned down.  No sooner has Frederick Wentworth, the former suitor, now a successful and dashing Captain, strode back into Anne's life, than all her repressed feelings start to surge back.  With mortifying consequences.
Nick Dear's adaptation was made for the BBC in the shadow of Andrew Davies' much more well-known (and more expensive) version of ""Pride and Prejudice"".  It's far better.  ""Pride and Prejudice"" ended up as an exercise in set dressing, with good performances defeated by lavish frocks and relentless background music.  ""Persuasion"" was shot entirely on location, using only natural light (the evening parties are all in authentic sepia-toned candlelight), and almost all the music is being played in the scene, instead of swamping bad writing with mood.  The characters get wind-blown and muddy and wet.  This isn't really a costume drama at all; the only things that seem alien are the manners.  A lot of this is presumably due to Roger Michell, the director.
Yet Michell also throws the responsibility for conveying this almost entirely unspoken story onto his actors, who excel.  Amanda Root is superb as Anne.  She starts out as a red-faced, mildly haggard-looking spinster and blooms into a radiant heroine, and yet seems to do it entirely without makeup; her manner changes, her gestures and range of expressions become freer, and as her love gains control over her sense of duty, she turns, as it were, into her real self.  Ciaran Hinds is equally good as the impressively sideburned Wentworth; he goes from brusque and almost rude to desperately sincere.  The rest of the cast are distinguished; John Woodvine as the genial Admiral Croft, Fiona Shaw nicely underacting for a change as the Admiral's wife, Corin Redgrave as Anne's risibly pompous and snobbish father, Samuel West as the oleaginous creep of a suitor, Sophie Thompson as Anne's sniffy and hypochondriac sister, Simon Russell Beale as the bluff and endearingly clueless brother-in-law...everybody is good.
This is a story told almost entirely by looks alone, and is as such a masterclass in acting, directing and editing.  Easily one of the best Jane Austen adaptations ever, and incidentally one of the most satisfying British films of the 90s.  You can watch it again and again and keep picking up on something you'd missed before.  I'd even say - and you're entitled to shriek and storm off in a petulant frenzy - that in its technical excellence and emotional generosity, it's a better work of art than the original novel.",972950400,14,3334,4.976576576576576
753979,4,6303965415,"Although it does not compete with the elegance of the theatrical releases of ""Sense & Sensibility"" and ""Emma,"" this 1996 BBC Films production of ""Persuasion"" has its own place in the Jane Austen revival of the past decade.  With Anne Elliot (Amanda Root) and Captain Wentworth (Ciarn Hinds) we have the longest suffering set of lovers in all of Austen's domestic novels.  Eight years early Anne had been persuaded by a snobbish friend of the family to reject Wentworth as a suitor since he was a young naval officer with no prospects.  But now the financial fortunes of both parties are reversed, with the Elliots on the verge of bankruptcy and Wentworth a successful captain in the war against Napoleon, but their feelings for each other are unchanged.  It is just a question of when the two lovers will figure this out.
Root and Hinds, both members of the Royal Shakespeare Company, bring the requisite maturity to their roles.  Anne Elliot is the quintessential Austen old maid, with a resigned acceptance of her fate and an inherent dignity in the face of life's little quirks that makes the happy ending all the more enjoyable.  This is one of those steady, unremarkable performances where you really forget Root is acting.  She simply is Anne.  Hinds has a marvelous scene where he puts aside the requirements of polite society to tell off the woman who thwarted his happiness.  As is a requirement with all BBC period piece productions, the supporting cast is superb, especially Sophie Thompson as Anne's hypochondriac sister Mary (this is another one of those Austen literary families where the heroine is the only worthwhile one in the lot).
To me the most intriguing part of this adaptation is that it manages to incorporate both Austen's original and revised endings for the novel.  I must admit that I prefer the revised ending because for once she has the reconciliation of the two lovers be the result of one of them having the courage to tell the other one how they feel (albeit in a letter rather than face to face).  This was certainly quite different from Austen's usual tack of them accidentally learning about their true feelings for each other (e.g., ""Pride and Prejudice"").  I always considered this to be evidence of Austen's maturity as a writer, but unfortunately the work was published posthumously.",971136000,7,2325,4.873096446700508
754094,2,6303965415,"This is the only Jane Austen adaptation that I have seen which fails.  The  characters never engage one's interest, and the influence of Anne's friend  is underplayed so much as to leave the viewer wondering why Austen titled  her book ""Persuasion"".  Primarily missing is the tension  between characters and subtle interplay that make Austen's novels such  page-turners.

The  two lovers showed very little passion.  Root had almost the same expression  on her face throughout the whole story. The actors spent more time eating  than talking. And there was an overall feeling of heaviness. The book is  far better than the movie. The only good thing about the movie was the  scenery, and so I give it 2 stars.",967766400,5,470,4.447058823529412
754096,5,6303965415,"A young woman, Anne, is persuaded by her close friend and surrogate mother, Lady Russell, to reject a young sea-man's offer of marriage because he is poor and without prospects. Eight years later, now a prosperous  ship's captain, he comes home and is looking for a wife.
This must be the  definitive adaption of Jane Austen's novel Persuasion. I cannot imagine any  future adaption surpassing it. Every actor is the very embodiment  of his  or her character. Jane Austen, I think, would have recognised them all.  Amanda Root is particularly good as Anne with her large expressive eyes.  She is exactly the way I imagined her to be. And Fiona Shaw as Mrs Coft and  Susan fleetwood  as Lady Russell are both excellent.
However, I have some  slight doubt about Ciaran Hinds who played Captain Wentworth. He certainly  looked the part, though why they allowed him to appear in his first scene,  when he should have been at his most impressive, wearing a  filthy looking  top-coat and a scruffy cravat I've no idea. But, as a ship's captain,  Wentworth should have been portrayed as a strong man  with  an easy,  confident manner and Ciaran Hinds it seems to me was a little lacking in  that respect. At the dinner table when he was flirting with the Musgrove  sisters, Louisa and Henrietta, and should have been at his most charming,  he seemed to have some slight awkwardness and impediment in his  speech.
And the scene at the recital when he storms off in a jealous rage  was a bit over the top. A good man, even in a jealous rage, would never  treat the woman he loves so unfeelingly, particularly after she has shown  she cares by abandoning the other man and chasing after him. It was  childish behaviour and heroic ship's captains are not normally prone to  childish behaviour. But this scene is false to the novel and falsifies both  the character of Wentworth and Anne. In the novel she does not chase after  him; no woman at that time would have dreamt of doing such a thing in a  public place. It would have been unthinkable. He comes to talk to her and  it in only when  Mr Elliot approaches to urge her  to return to her seat  that he allows his jealous feelings to show and, saying goodbye, leaves  abruptly. But not in anger. More in sorrow than anger.
The novel of  course is much richer than the dramatisation could ever be in its allotted  time span. In the scene where Wentworth hands Anne into the carriage  alongside Admiral Croft and his wife, we are left to infer Anne's feelings.  In the novel, Jane Austen devotes nearly a whole page to expressing those  feelings.
The film has a very moving ending. It made me cry. But then I  cry whilst reading any of  Jane Austen's novels or indeed whilst watching  any good adaption. The very best, the unbeatable dramatisation, of course,  is the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice - though even that is not  without its flaws.",963619200,9,2892,4.584313725490196
754097,4,6303965415,Another great movie from a Jane Austin novel. Wonderful acting by Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds and the rest of the cast. But the DVD audio conversion is very bad. The background sounds are louder than the rest of  the movie. This small problem ruins a great movie.,963446400,4,264,4.5
754098,5,6303965415,"This is a fine movie adaptation of a beautiful story about a gracious, intelligent woman falling in love again with a former fiance.  This Jane Austen story is very sweet and moving and the heroine is particularly  worthy.  Amanda Root did a wonderful job playing this role.  Ciaran Hinds  did very nicely as the suitor, but his character doesn't shine quite as  well as in the book.  Overall, a pleasant and touching film.
Some of the  negative reviewers below compare this film with Emma and Sense and  Sensibility and if you are looking for high-gloss, Hollywood Austen, then  you might agree with their opinions.  But this is not a high-budget movie,  and as enjoyable as those movies are, this one gives another perspective  into Jane Austen's world which is probably more faithful.  To true fans of  Austen, this film will hold its own.",961545600,9,842,4.79020979020979
754099,1,6303965415,I watched the earlier version of this movie and was not too pleased with it. Now I have watched this version on DVD and find the actors and progression of the movie to be even duller. Anne looks all the way through  as though she were a bewildered child who had just left an orphanage. I  loved Emma and Sense & Sensibility and was sorely disappointed in this  one.,960854400,13,365,4.260869565217392
754100,4,6303965415,"Bear in mind that I am one of those to whom every omission from the book in filming is a misdemeanor and every addition a felony.  Having indicated that bias, I will omit the list of the corresponding crimes committed in  filming ""Persuasion.""  Some compression of action is inevitable, and some  thoughts must be expressed in words.  I admit the necessity while I deplore  it.
The price paid by streamlining action and painting characters in  broad strokes is that one loses the hallmark of a Jane Austen novel: the  masterful development of character by the careful drawing of one fine line  after another.  The film takes care with Anne Elliot and takes liberties  elsewhere.  Anne is my personal favorite of the Austen heroines, and I was  pleased by the manner in which she is brought to the screen.  I found  Captain Wentworth an acceptable, if tongue-tied suitor.  So much for the  principals.  I have small reservations with most of the supporting cast.  Sister Mary whines appropriately, and her husband Charles is rendered  fairly.  The Lyme household is suitably pleasant company, and the Musgroves  come across well.  Changing Charles Hayter's first name to Henry was a good  idea.  There are five people named Charles in the original novel.  There  was no good reason to change Fanny Harville's name to Phoebe, but no harm  done either.  The Crofts have more dignity in the film than in the book  reducing a desired contrast with Sir Walter and Elizabeth Elliot.  William  Elliot is too young for my taste, and the film fails to define Lady  Russell's role clearly.  Short shrift is given, necessarily, to minor  characters such as Mr. Shepherd, Mrs. Clay, Mrs. Smith, Nurse Root, and the  Dalrymples.
I think the film failed with Sir Walter and Elizabeth.  Sir  Walter had many faults, but he was entitled to be satisfied with his  appearance.  The film's Elizabeth Elliot resembled Lydia Bennet more than  the very superior, elegant baronet's daughter whom Jane Austen gave us.  Elizabeth set my teeth on edge every time she lounged into the room or  opened her common mouth.  We have ample reason to dislike her for her  neglect of Anne.  The caricature was  distracting and unnecessary.  Fortunately, the film can get by without an accurate portrayal of these two  whose facade was so much more pleasing than their substance.
Those coming  to Jane Austen for the first time through the movie have a treat in store  for them.  Those who love ""Persuasion"" will be glad to have it on film, but  will not find this one of those rare cases where a film is able to do  justice to a book.  You haven't read the book?  Don't wait a minute longer  to do so.",957484800,15,2665,4.746696035242291
754101,3,6303965415,"While it is impossible to condense every particular of a novel into a 2 hour movie, Persuasion does a creditable job of capturing the taste of Jane Austen's touching and sweet little story of Anne Elliot's long-enduring  love for Captain Wentworth.
The director obviously took pains to make  this movie ""earthy"" - you'll see unkempt hair, wind-burned  cheeks, crumbs on a breakfast table, dirty hems, all little human touches  that are sometimes missing from the average brittle, formal costume  drama.
However, my one critcism is that I found ""Anne Elliot""  to be rather wooden. A fine movie, but Anne skulks through it and flashes  her big eyes occasionally for effect; her metamorphosis from a thin, pale  old maid into a blooming pretty young woman is nonexistent. This is a minor  quibble, and not mean to deter anyone from purchasing what is really an  enjoyable film. ""Captain Wentworth"" is particularly attracitve  and boisterous and truly steals the show.",957312000,3,964,5.076433121019108
754102,1,6303965415,"I rented this movie because I thought hey, Jane Austen, a fine author.  Well, she is still a fine author, but the creators of this film weren't so fine.  I found the actress who portrayed Anne Elliot to be sadly lacking in emotional feeling.  Wentworth was too much, and Mr. Elliot was, shall we  say, a little, well, you know.  If you want good J. Austin, check out  movies like Emma or Sense and Sensibility.",957225600,7,410,4.4
754103,4,6303965415,"I own this movie, and I highly recommend it.  Next to the 1996 version of Pride and Prejudice it  is my favorite movie pertaining to Jane Austen's stories.  It is true to the story line.  The acting is superb.  You won't  regret purchasing it.",956880000,2,243,4.409090909090909
754164,4,6303965415,"I enjoyed the movie, however, at times I found the movie could use more intense scenes between the two stars during the movie instead at the end.

754165,5,6303965415,"Amanda Root plays Anne Elliot wonderfully, though I think Ciaran Hinds was a bit over the top in his portrayal of Wentworth. I don't think Jane Austen had such a forceful Wentworth in mind when she wrote Persuasion.  All the  same, the BBC has come fairly close to rendering as faithful a rendition of  the book as can be done in a 2 hour film. They do a lovely job of bringing  a sad, worn woman back to youthful bloom as she is more in the sphere of  her old love. The actors who played Anne's sisters were terrific, but her  father wasn't near the ""fop"" in the book as portrayed in the  movie. The story is a terrific one, about love lost and re-won, and what  can befall you if you do not trust your own judgment even when it is  superior to those around you.  This is one of Jane's rare novels where she  takes you to different areas of England...from the countryside to Bath, to  Lyme Regis. It makes for lovely photography and creates visual interest.  This is one of those movies you'll be drawn to watch again and again.",955065600,32,1029,4.269430051813472
754166,4,6303965415,"If you like Jane Austin's style of romance, character development, and plot construction, then you will probably like this film.
The story involves the possibility of a second chance at romance conflicted with the  resentment left over from the first attempt. The result has been described  as ""an adult fairy tale"" or the perfect ""chick flick.""  To a degree I could agree with either description, but the story's conflict  is a bit more complex then one would expect for an ""adult fairy  tale.""  The conflict between the romantic and rational is  demonstrated: Lady Russell attempts to influence Anne to marry Eliot for  rational reasons all while Anne feels romantically inclined towards  Whetworth. Lady Russell has succeed before since it was her ability to  persuade Anne to turn Wentworth's proposal of marriage down eight years  before. The world's repeated intrusion especially at points when the two  are about to reconcile is contrasted with an unusual scene when a circus  (symbolically the world) finally passes them by when the conflicts are  finally resolved.
The character development is subtle. My wife and I have  watched this film many times, and each time we have noticed something new.  Wentworth is resentful, but he still loves Anne (but he goes out of his way  not to show it). Anne still loves Wentworth, but is being careful because  she doesn't want to be hurt. Her comment that her sex will still love  longest when all hope is gone is a perfect summation of her attitude. Most  of the characters are three dimensional, with a couple of intended  exceptions: Anne's father and sister are amusingly single dimensional. The  unintential one dimensional exceptions are Mr Eliot, Lady Russell, and Mrs.  Smith for reasons that will be covered later.
The plot construction  involves a series of social reversals that have taken place in eight years:  those reversals involve the economic situation between Wentworth and Anne's  family, the romantic reversals, and the social reversals. The social  reversals are particularily amusing as one observes Anne's father and  sister's obsession with rank and connections. This behavior is reasonable  since the father and sister seem to have lost everything else.
There are  several additional things that I like about this film. The photography is  excellect, the sound is good, and the music is simple. The music is  especially good being made up of period pieces played on original  instruments (original instruments have an unusual twang not present in  modern versions of the same instruments).
The things that I don't like  might be slightly minor to most audiences: Lady Russell is portrayed  unusually harsh in this film. In other versions of Persuasion (1971), I  believe her character is treated more fairly, yes, she has persuaded Anne  in the past, but not strictly for monetary and social reasons. In the book  and the earlier film, Lady Russell's behavior is motivated by Anne's  happiness and makes her judgments accordingly. The character of Anne's  friend ""Mrs. Smith"" is portrayed positively in this film (1995)  than in the book or the earlier version of this film (1971). Mrs. Smith is  in a nasty economic situation created by Mr. Eliot. She has a vested  interested in seeing that Anne marries Eliot because it might help her out  of her situation. The 1995 film discards this entire relation and makes the  only connection one of gossip. It makes Mrs. Smith look much nicer, but it  loses yet another view of Mr. Eliot's character. As a result Mr. Eliot and  Mrs. Smith become single dimentional characters and it detracts from the  story. Austin always has at least one rogue in her story. Her rogues  usually have one dark secret which is revealed at some point in her story,  and Persuasion is no exception. But Mr. Eliot's motives, and actions seem  strangely disconnected until nearly the end. Even his relationship with  Mrs. Clay (which is a significant point in the 1971 film and book) is  glossed over. One has to read between the lines to infer his intentions in  regard to Mrs. Clay.
I highly recommend this film. I especially recommend  the DVD version with a small amplifier and a pair of external speakers  since some subtle statements, background noise, and music could be lost. I  know since I have watched this film many times on VHS and DVD.
