1783371,2,B00006K11W,"Adoptive parents should be aware of the problematic aspects of this movie for kids who were adopted. When Stuart's biological parents arrive on the scene and announce that they want Stuart back, his adoptive parents hand him over, no questions asked. There is no sense that adoption is permanent. If your adopted child sees this movie, be prepared to discuss it afterwards and assure your child this would never happen in real life.",1058486400,,432,4.931506849315069
1783372,2,B00006K11W,"What's the deal, slipping the fullscreen version of Stuart Little in with the widescreen version of Stuart Little 2 and mislabeling the package?! A 4:3 aspect ratio film should NOT be called a ""Deluxe Version"" when there is a 16:9 version available. I feel very deceived/taken by this, and am docking these otherwise cute movies 2 full stars for Studio Stupidity.",1039910400,18,363,4.967213114754099
7970908,1,B00006K11W,"The sound quality is very poor and at time can't hear anything. Very disappointed because this was bought for my 4 year old daughter who like Stewart Little. Reason for purchase was for our long plane rides and car rides to entertain her. But it's useless because of you can barely hear and at time you hear nothing and the UMD was dirty/grease when I open the package. I would not recommend buying anything from the seller. I saw that seller had good marks but not after this purchase. I want a replacement of this product, will see if that happens",1427587200,,549,4.445544554455446

7970915,5,B00006K11W,"I found this two boxed VHS set at Marshall's for 5.99, brand new, so the asking price here it way too high, but the movies are wonderful for both kids and parents alike.  I have a three year old and he is crazy about Stuart Little.  You can't go wrong with these films!",1143849600,,269,4.056603773584905
7970916,5,B00006K11W,"My 3 year old just loves both of these movies.  We were watching them both one night on the abc family channel and I just knew after a few moments of her giggling I had to get them for her.  She's always asking to watch the ""Mouse Movie"".",1125792000,,238,3.9375
7970917,2,B00006K11W,"As has been noted by other reviews, this Stuart Little 2-Pack only contains a Fullscreen format for the original film. A few years ago, it was issued in a wonderful ""Collector's Series"" widescreen disc with just about everything that is included on the ""Deluxe Edition"" (save a promo or two for the sequel). It's out-of-print now, but you should still be able to track it down, and it is worth it. Remember, you want ""Collector's Series"", NOT ""Deluxe Edition.""
As for the movies, well, both are fun. The original is undoubtedly superior, as it's entirely enveloping for young and old alike, with a mix of heartwarming drama and some witty humor. Michael J. Fox is perfectly cast as Stuart, the little mouse with a big heart and a big family. His adventures in New York City are handled with fairy-tale treatment, that also, seems appropriate.
The sequel feels a little too formulaic, while not remaining entirely true to the first film at the same time. Overall, it doesn't work as well as the original, but it's very entertaining all the same, and James Woods voices the villain like only he can (his recent resume illustrates that this role is a forte).
""Stuart Little 2"" contains both Widescreen and Fullscreen on its only release, but you'll want to pass this 2-pack and get the ""Collector's Series"" (Widescreen) for the original ""Stuart Little."" (Rating applies to the DVD 2-Pack.)",1062028800,11,1386,4.852320675105485
