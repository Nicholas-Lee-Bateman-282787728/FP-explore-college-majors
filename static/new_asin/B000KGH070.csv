2691136,5,B000KGH070,"I love it! When I purchased this DVD the box stated 2004, how delighted I was to find a 1987 hiding in that box! Being a fan of 80's cheese I find this far from it. If you liked Trancers this is 100% better. The model work is quite good for a low budget film and I would recomend it to anyone who likes low budget but be prepared for a suprise!",1195948800,15,344,3.7916666666666665
2691137,3,B000KGH070,"This imaginative space sci fi adventure was originally called Star Quest which was aired on the Sci Fi Channel.  Now with improved special effects and tighter scenes it is renamed Outerworld.  But wait:  What if you're a fan of the original Star Quest untouched?  No problem there, because this DVD also contains the full version of the original Star Quest digitally remastered and color corrected.  So you can see and compare both films on one DVD.  You will see how the explosions look better, the ships flying are now done by CG giving them more realistic movements, there are more complicated scenes that never could have been done by models and the best part is the story flows better now.  So, if you're a fan of sci fi, the original Star Quest or just want to experience Outerworld for yourself, I highly recommend it.  Kuriyama's Promethean ship is a force to be reconded with as the genetically engineered superbeing Pentan (Tracy Davis) fights for her life and to stop the evil Kuriyama's coorporation gaining one of the most important scientific finds ever in human history.  Good acting, nice story, great use of models and special effects.  Outerworld is guranteed to take you to another universe!",1191974400,39,1210,4.8585365853658535
2691138,1,B000KGH070,"OLD, VERY BAD sci-fi film SLIGHTLY updated with computer generated graphics. The acting is laughable. Looks like someone decided to make a film with their video camera.

2691139,4,B000KGH070,"Writer/director/cinematographer/editor/special effects designer Philip Cook is known for throwing himself into his movies. This is more than just another indie science fiction flick, it contains great action and thrills, good characters, a lot of heart, and a wealth of imagination. The effects work is simply stunning and really helps augment the world of intrigue, greed, and hope found in the story. The backdrops are especially dazzling, including the detailed miniatures, though Cook never gets overindulgent and concentrates on them for too long. In fact, one of the most rewarding parts of this production is that the characters always come first, despite the inventive effects and CGI work. Maybe Hollywood can't figure that equation out but Cook seems to do it with every film that he makes. He makes movies about people. True, his characters are often engaged in incredible circumstances, but that doesn't negate the fact that the front burner issues in the stories are Cook's interesting mediations about humanity.

CultCuts Films -- Craig Hamman

This imaginative outer-space tale traverses the galaxy, offering three different planetary environments, aerial dogfights, and a climactic duel with atomic warheads...provides a number of thrills, and neither the filmmakers nor viewers can say they didn't get their money's worth.

TV Guide

Philip Cook, an industrial filmmaker in the Washington area has turned out three live-action science-fiction gems [OUTERWORLD, INVADER & DESPISER] that contain entire fantasy universes worthy of C.S. Lewis....

Joe Bob Briggs -- United Press International

I was so often left in awe of Cook's ambitious vision....In every frame there's something new to blow your mind. If I thought [DESPISER] showed gusto, then it's nothing compared to OUTERWORLD.

b-independent -- on-line cult-entertainment

Outerworld is good fun and you can't really ask more than that. The leads are likeable, the plot is internally consistent and there are some interesting quirks that make it stand out from the morass of the 1980s science fiction boom. Most importantly, Cook's reworking of the film nearly 20 years later works to make it better, unlike a certain trilogy of big budget `special editions' which seemed to just have new effects inserted at random irrespective of whether they added anything or not.

2691158,3,B000KGH070,"This is a low budget sci-fi movie from the late 1980's that I decided to give a chance, and I'm glad I did.  The first few minutes were sort of hokey, but I stuck it out and was rewarded by seeing convincing-enough acting and a unique and beautiful approach to special effects in a sci-fi movie that was done on a low budget before CGI became mainstream (It looks like some CGI is in this movie, and it boggles my mind to think of the computers and software they did it with in 1987.)

Tracy Davis is an adorably cute woman who plays the part of the genetically engineered killing-machine-with-a-conscience perfectly.  I actually looked her up to see what other movies she was in and was saddened to find that this was about it for her.

This movie may be ""bad"" compared to the mainstream sci-fi classics like Blade Runner and Star Wars, but it comes across a someone's labor of love that was done with little money and a lot of care.  Give it a try.  The price is right.",1351209600,3,971,4.337016574585635

An above average hybrid named Pentan (Tracy Davis) is trained to do the dirty work for the corporation with the threat of being dispatched on failure. She sissies on an opportunity to escape and become normal but rich and makes her break for it. The rest of the movie is the obligatory chase scenes.

2691164,3,B000KGH070,"This one is marginal as sci-fi movies go; not really bad but certainly not great. The familiar plot of the bionically engineered human is pulled off the shelf and given another workout; in this case it happens to be a beautiful female who has been crafted by a corporation to do its dirty work.

One of the down sides of the extra effort put in to this one's design was a developing sense of self and a desire to be free of corporate constraints. When a discovery sends Pentan, played by Tracy Davis, on a mission to recover some key information from a rival corporation she decides to improvise on her assignment and do her own thing.

During the course of her adventure Pentan begins to discover some new things about herself with the assistance of Captain Brickman who she hires to take her to the discovery which will change their lives. Her former employer, the evil Kuriyama Corporation, doesn't take well to her defection with key information and gives hot pursuit. The major part of the movie involves Pentan and Captain Brickman trying to find the discovery and stay alive in the meantime.

Will they succeed or die in the effort; you'll have to watch it to find out.",1316908800,3,1176,4.59047619047619

2691166,4,B000KGH070,"If you take ""Blade Runner"" and combine it with ""Robocop"" and ""Star Wars"" then you get ""Outerworld"". ""Outerworld"" was originally called ""Beyond the Rising Moon"", but in 2004 they renamed it ""Outerworld"", re-edited it, and put new CGI effects in it. The main feature on this disc is ""Outerworld"", but also includes the original ""Beyond the Rising Moon"" on the special features so you get both versions. Personally I prefere the original. The editing is much better on the original, the story's not as rushed, and most of the model shots I think look more realistic than the bad CGI effects they used for the updated version. But the new version does have some things to offer. Such as Robert's death that was never featured in the orginal, and the final battle which takes place in an asteroid feild. Originally there were no asteroids. And the spaceship explosion at the end is much more impressive than the one they had in the original. The thing about this DVD is that you get both versions.

Pentan is a genetically engineered human that was created for corporate warfare. But when she gets tired of killing and being a slave to an evil corporation, she rebels against her emplorers, and an action-packed adventure across the stars begins.

Although the acting is lacking in some areas, for the most part this was a great movie with a lot of action and a great plot.

2691168,1,B000KGH070,"Okay, so the special effects weren't awful for the time it was made, but this Tracy Davis has to be the worst actress EVER.  She talks and moves like she's made of wood.  I mean, I've talked with statues with more life and personality.  I am the biggest sci-fi nut EVER, and can watch almost anything, but not this.  If I had gotten this in the $1 bin at a discount store, I would have gone back and asked for a refund!  I can only assume the good reviews came from family members of the movie makers themselves.  NOBODY could possibly have found this tripe watchable. I actually threw my copy in the trash.  (I didn't want to inflict it on another human being by reselling it on eBay).

The plot typical of big greedy corporations trying to run the universe. The sepcial effects were amaturish. The casting was of unknowns who I hope have other jobs outside of Hollywood. In short, this movie is an incredible waste of time and money. Do yourself a big favor and do not even think of renting let alone buying this piece of trash. If anyone disagrees with this, then they can buy my copy CHEAP. I love grade B bad movies, but this is even below that low standard.",1238976000,6,641,4.394957983193278

8156770,5,B000KGH070,"I am giving Outerworld 5 stars with the qualification that this is a B movie so my grade reflects certain allowances. The film is low budget so they could only afford amateur actors, amateur special effects, amateur fight scenes, etc. That is to say that you can't hold Outerworld, or other B films, to the same standards as big budget movies. What you need to do is to keep your expectations low and let the film speak for itself.

I must say that I was  taken by Outerworld after about 5 to 10 minutes. Most films I want to turn off after 5 to 10 minutes but Outerworld has soul/spirit. By the end of the film, I found myself genuinely worried for Pentan, especially when she was in her space fighter and chose to take out the bad guys in order to guarantee her and Brickman's freedom forever. I thought, ""Oh my gosh, they are going to kill off her character here!"" Brickman's character also grew on me. The relationship between he and Pentan was unique because she was this incredible killer and he was a weakling in comparison but her feelings evolved for him.
