8564528,3,B00B999ENA,"My son loves this move and the other ""Car's Life"" movies. I think to him (age 5) they are a ""good enough"" movie about cars, and he loves all types of cars. He doesn't draw any comparisons to the Disney franchise.
  As a mom, however, I don't approve of the back-talking and sassy attitude displayed by the boy-car (the son) toward his father and most other adults. And his sister is often left to her own devices to entertain herself unsupervised; in one of these movies she teaches herself to do jumps off ramps, with her crashes -- the result of her initial attempts -- usually off screen, so not showing child viewers how she might have hurt herself.
  Oh and stereotypes abound, so if you're sensitive to the typical Irish cop role, or the rough-and-tumble New Jersey cousin coming into town, just be prepared to overlook it while your child laughs at poor jokes. Hopefully this movie won't leave an indelible impression!",1466121600,,925,4.656441717791411

8564530,1,B00B999ENA,"In a world of direct-to-video franchise ripoffs....the bar has been set to a new low. The video is insulting at almost every level and while debating whether the plot or characters were the worst, the animation struck me as looking like something done for a school project. I can't imagine an age group that this movie is appropriate for and the only saving grace is there are product tie-ins; but pretty sure after seeing it, no kid would want a Sparky toy anyway.",1457395200,2,465,4.614457831325301

8564533,1,B00B999ENA,"Hated it. The plot is predictable, the points jump from one to another. Its a rip off of Cars. Everytime I watch A Cars Life Movie, I have bad depressions episodes. Animation sucks. Poorly made, waste of money. Do not buy.",1413763200,,222,4.439024390243903
8564534,1,B00B999ENA,This is an insult to Pixar's Cars. You need to save your money. I've looked it up. It's crap. crap. stupid. ugly. Not ok to others.,1379808000,2,131,4.076923076923077
