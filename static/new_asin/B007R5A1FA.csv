5105122,2,B007R5A1FA,Being a big fan of zombie movies I thought I'd give this a try. It was ok but I couldn't get through the whole movie. There was just no interest in the lame plot or the unexciting characters.,1344816000,,191,4.052631578947368
5105123,2,B007R5A1FA,"I had hoped that this movie would be a 'hidden gem' like 'The Dead' was by The Ford Brothers but this movie never got off the ground. I didn't even find this mildly entertaining, or interesting, as I did with 'Abe Lincoln vs Zombies.' It was flat, like warm beer or soda. If you like it, GREAT but I hope that I've saved most of you a wasted rental fee!",1344556800,,353,4.057142857142857
5105124,4,B007R5A1FA,"Let me start this review by saying that I am in no way related to the making of this movie, nor do I know anyone involved in any way with this movie! With that out of the way let me say that I enjoyed and found this to be a pretty good movie about what survivors would do to survive and take care of the ones they love during a zombie outbreak! This movie is not a mindless ""shoot-um-up"", blood and gore action zombie movie!
No, Dead Season isn't perfect, it has a few minor flaws ... there were several continuity problems, (Tweeter & Elvis go to pick up their boat and somehow her clean white tank top gets blood all across it... and after Elvis & Tweeter get garden hose bathed and are all clean, a bruise seems to appear on Elvis' face right after he and Tweeter are separated and Conrad comes to ask a few simple questions).  And there were several scenes that I feel could have been fleshed out or just completely dropped entirely, mainly Tweeter's watching the tape of the birthday party... yes, Conrad cuts the cake while Elvis cuts up dinner, but I really didn't think it informed me on what kind of person Conrad was before the zombie apocalypse and why he would change his ""diet"" after the z.a.!
There are a few problems with the pacing of the movie. Some scenes zoom by while others just drag along. I'm sure budget and time constraints are the major reason for this. I only wish the movie had run a little longer, but with that said, after watching the deleted scenes... thank goodness they were taken out!
Plot holes, pacing and inconsistencies aside, on the positive side, I found the story interesting (no, it is nothing really new to the zombie genre, this is a zombie movie not some major Hollywood remake, and it didn't tell how or why folks were becoming zombies but this movie is about folks trying to survive, not pontificate and then search for a cure!). Most importantly, time and thought was taken when the story and script were written. Guess what, characters are not standing around arguing and yelling at each other throughout the entire movie! Yea for the script writers for taking the time to write believable character dialogue!  As for the actors and their acting ability, I thought the actors did a fine acting job. Sure, some were better than others, but I though all the actors did their job well enough for me to suspend disbelief and enjoy some zombie fighting action!  As for zombie make-up and special effects, I thought both were just fine! There is no major Hollywood zombie make-up, but there was no visible stop off lines at the neck and shirt sleeves either!
I needed a good zombie fix movie and I found it with Dead Season!",1344297600,2,2668,4.496907216494845
5105125,5,B007R5A1FA,"Dead Season is one of the best zombie movies I have seen in a long time! I am talking about big budget and low budget zombie movies,  this one ranks with the best. If someone told me this was a George Romero's Dead movie I would believe it immediately!  The Amazon price is way too expensive, Wallyworld has it for $10, now that is a bargain!",1343779200,3,342,4.166666666666667
5105126,3,B007R5A1FA,"I was pretty excited about this one. I watch just about every zombie movie that comes out from the big budget ones down to things made for a hundred bucks. What i can tell you is that along THAT continuum, this is by far above average. But does that mean its GOOD? I'm not sure - but its not BAD. As far as the technical aspects go, this film is lovely. The cinematography is excellent (i'm going to assume it was filmed on DSLR - looks like a 5D or 7D?) and everything is wonderfully framed. The acting is above par for a film of this budget. The ""bad"" guy is the strongest performance, with maybe the most unsteady of all coming from the male ""lead"" - though not to a degree that takes away from anything. I use quotation marks because there isn't really a lead or a villain, just people that NEARLY take that role. Now, i don't have a problem with not filling standard archetypes of film - its just that these characters could have been so much deeper. The pacing of this film was so fast that you didn't really get a chance to feel story. It could have been about half an hour longer, really. But the pacing was so quick that some of the scenes didn't work - such as an emotionally intense execution of an infected party member when, in fact, you've only had 5 minutes of screen time to get to know the character. It just feels a little bit rushed, which upsets you because it didn't need to be rushed.

The zombie make up was alright. Not amazing but not cheap. The sets work really well and you believe pretty much everything you see. There is even a few doses of nudity that, well, aren't half bad.

Overall, I would recommend this movie and really would have liked to have seen a longer, more ""fleshed out"" version.",1343433600,17,1723,4.282208588957055
5105127,2,B007R5A1FA,"I suspect the two people here who have one review, this movie, which they rave about, are the same folks who left the rave reviews at the IMDB too (where there they also have one review - this one). Once you see the actual movie, you'll understand. This is not good - it's essentially a rip off of Day of the Dead - with amateur actors, bad direction and a bad script. Not the ""tremendous"" movie you read other ""reviewers"" writing about. And what is it with folks who've worked on a movie who come in here and praise it - they ALWAYS say ""it wasn't what I expected."" Do they get these lines out of a ""how to pretend to be someone else praising your own movie"" book? I've said it before, I'll say it again- people who work on the movie should NOT be allowed to write pretend reviews in Amazon and the IMDB. It's unethical to see someone talking about how great it is when clearly it's not. Then you get folks like me who are even more angered and make sure to let the public know the truth - so the whole fake review thing backfires. AVOID",1343433600,14,1038,4.169154228855722
5105128,5,B007R5A1FA,"I will first say that I tend to like the more romantic Legends Of The Fall kinds of movies. That being said, my husband was watching this and I walked in ten minutes in and was drawn to it. I made him start it over, and why doesn't vod let you keep the movie for more than two days!?! Anyway, fun movie with quality picture and acting. Elvis is no Tristan though, but grow on you cute nonetheless.",1343347200,2,397,4.102564102564102
5105129,2,B007R5A1FA,"In theory, it should not be that difficult to make a decent zombie film.  It's one sub-genre where fans don't mind you sticking to a tried and true formula...in fact most zombie film fans prefer that you do.  You can make a good zombie film on a very small budget and with actors who have little or no experience.  George Romero and many others have proven this over and over...But you know what you don't want in a zombie film?  You don't want an overly complex plot and unfortunately that's what you get with Dead Season.

Dead Season begins by staying within the usual zombie formula...a zombie outbreak has hit the world as a handful of survivors struggle to carry on.  Elvis and Tweeter (and I swear that is their names in the film) are a pair of survivors who meet by chance.  They are able to procure a boat to take them to DeSoto island, off the coast of Florida, where there is a rumored safe harbor.  They arrive to find that a group has established a fort at a former naval gunnery range.  The fort is commanded by Kurt Conrad who runs things just like a military base.

After the first half hour, Dead Season slows to a crawl, concentrating far too much on drama within the camp rather than surviving against the undead.  Kurt keeps his young daughter locked up in her room all day for her protection.  Elvis and Kurt battle over philosophical differences and then a silly twist that conjures up memories of the 1970s sci-fi film Soylent Green completely unhinges the film.  When a zombie film is good, you can easily overlook things like bad scripting and acting.  But when it's not good, those things stand out even more.  Dead Season is loaded with holes.  The make-up effects are average.  There's nothing much in the way of rotting zombies, just sort of standard pale makeup and blood effects.  Not bad but nothing stands out.  Moreover a morose piano soundtrack helps keep the tone slow and depressing.

This is a film that started out on the right path but director Adam Deyoe simply tried to do too much and didn't concentrate on just making a zombie film.",1343260800,3,2076,4.529569892473118
5105130,4,B007R5A1FA,"This movie had a lot of things working for it.  I didn't think that it would travel down the road it did, it questioned humanity and made me ask myself and ponder the thoughts of what the hell would I do if in this type of situation.  It seems in the world we live in today there are actually other 3rd world countries that are faced with these questions of survival and shortage of food supply.  The human element was not expected and I appreciated the thought that went into making this low budget movie.  I give the acting top billing in this movie, the emotional element was alive and it pushed through the screen onto me.  I was drawn in with this horror/drama.  Fans of The Walking Dead should enjoy this.  Well crafted!",1343260800,4,726,4.373134328358209

5105133,2,B007R5A1FA,"Dead Season (Adam Deyoe, 2012)

Below average, but not entirely unwatchable, zombie thriller that at least attempts to do what every good zombie movie should: focus more on the survivors than the zombies. (Have you noticed how few recent zombie movies actually do that?) It's an amateur production made mostly by folks who generally do other things in the world (director Adam Deyoe, for example, usually works in the art department; his most recent job as I write this was as the art swing on Fading of the Cries. No wonder he wants to direct. But he also worked as the set dresser on the highly underrated 2006 shlockfest Candy Stripers, so it hasn't all been downhill), and from that angle, I have to give everyone involved points for enthusiasm, at least.

Plot: Elvis (Transformers' Scott Peat) and Tweeter (The Symphony's Marissa Merrill) are two of the final survivors of the zombie apocalypse still alive in mainland America. They've made it to Miami, where they're hoping to get out to the islands, where they figure they will have a better chance of survival. They procure a boat and head south, finding what they're looking for--but it turns out to be a little less idyllic than they were hoping.

The movie's strongest point is that it's got some really interesting ideas--not only about how people will survive after everything goes to hell (think of this as a different twist on the ""we promised them women"" scene from 28 Days Later...), but about how the pragmatism enforced upon survivors in the face of an apocalypse can bring about shifting allegiances and force people to make decisions that they would otherwise not even think about. Unfortunately, Deyoe's screenplay, so-written with Joshua Klausner and Loren Semmens (both producers trying their first hand at writing), doesn't spend nearly enough time exploring these aspects of the world they've built; they're too busy adding in the odd action scene here and there to keep the gorehounds from getting too restless. Which I guess is a valid point when you're trying to make a genre horror film, but then when you start adding in all those interesting questions, one has to wonder: at which point have you stopped making a genre horror film and started aspiring to something greater? That question, alas, I do not think got asked; if it had, we might have a very different, and much better, movie on our hands. But for a no-budget genre zombie thriller, it's not bad. **",1381276800,3,2443,4.853717026378897

5105137,2,B007R5A1FA,"Elvis and Tweeter think they've found hope off the coast of Florida, but they soon find themselves trapped on an island that is swarming with the undead! Brace yourself for more of the same tired cliches in the new zombie survival film DEAD SEASON, Adam Deyoe's fifth feature film following other such classics as PSYCHO SLEEPOVER and YETI: A LOVE STORY. The bore-o-meter is reading surprisingly high in Florida during this year's DEAD SEASON, with the only thing duller than the characters being the dreadful dialog that accompanies them. Cinematography Jeffrey Peters seems unusually obsessed with keeping everything tight in frame, filming nearly every shot in an unnecessary close-up. Credit is due to the film's make-up team for sticking strictly to practical effects, but the zombie action is infrequent at best, and hardly worth the wait. Everyone has their favorite season, but DEAD SEASON comes in dead last on that list.

5105139,1,B007R5A1FA,"The storyline was good and the potential for a good movie was there but the acting and the decisions of certain individuals turned the movie to crap. the effects were ok, the acting was horrid (not all but most actors), and the storyline commited suicide half way through the movie.

whilce watching the movie i felt like all was well and the conflict was going to be just as well thought of as the intro and buildup. i thought wow, since they seem to have an ok supply, fortified position, and pretty good experience and training with zombie dispatching, the conflict is bound to be good........WRONG! instead of the presence of an epic plot twist or an unforseen incident, we get stupid characters. yes they woke up one morning and decided that today was the day, they should be collaboratively ridonkulous. if you do decide to watch the movie then you'll know what i am talking about. if you don't watch it, then you saved yourself. i'll give an example... you know when you see someone running from the bad guy and they fall multiple times, or the drop their keys and you just think to yourself ""....Really?"" it was one of those moments that lasted like 15min and ruined the entire movie. i immediately regreted buying the movie half way through.

5105140,4,B007R5A1FA,"Yes this is another Zombie film it is also known as `The Running Dead'. The synopsis is that the outbreak of `the walkers' has been raging for a year and as usual society has collapsed and the few survivors face a daily battle to get the remaining food and just survive. Elvis (Scott Peat -`Transformers') makes contact with Tweeter (Marissa Merrill) and she has adopted a young boy called Toady, so all the names are original. They decide there is safety in numbers.

Well Elvis has made a deal to get a boat and enough fuel to get to this island that is allegedly Zombie free. So they go for it. At this point in time the Zombies can only shuffle around in the normal way, but they are beginning to mutate and reports are coming through that they have managed to evolve to being much more athletic.

Once on the island they discover that what they were told was not a clear representation of the facts and the daily struggle gets worse. There are loads of Zombie films that do a new take on the genre and this does try that, but for gore fans there may not be enough here to hold your full attention as much of the movie deals with the relationships of the non Zombies and how they are coping with the mental trauma. However the film actually works better for it as the Zombie menace is never very far away and is influencing everything else.

This is a well acted and directed film but I really didn't think it was overly inventive which is actually fine for Zombie purists as we have seen some very un Zombie behaviour in a few of late like `Dead Heads' to name but one. Still if you like a good character study with Zombie `action' and half a market (yes they bought the gore in a market in Mexico) of gore, then you will probably enjoy this.",1357084800,,1747,4.303951367781155

5105142,3,B007R5A1FA,"Every zombie movie reviewer goes into a new zombie movie with hope
and sometimes finishes disappointed.  I never judge a zombie movie by the
DVD jacket art.  This movie had a good story line that was somewhat
predictable.  Right off of the bat, we knew our survivers were tough
enough to take on a challenge.  Same goal as many survivors have, ""Lets
go to an island, where it is safe!""  The boat dealer was silly.  When
the boat left the marina, those background lights demonstrated that our
movie producer couldn't get the natives to turn off their lights for a
zombie apocalypse!  Something could have been improvised, but wasn't.
  The zombie make-up was acceptable, better than most low budget ones.
Character development was disappointing. The military commander was
stereotypical. There wasn't time to think that the island was a idealic
retreat, safe from zombie hoards(and worth fighting to protect), before
our characters are looking hard for a boat to escape in.
  The movie has a few surprises that are origional.
If you are bored and like zombie movies, this one merits watching.

A viral outbreak has created zombies which are called ""walkers"" with second generation zombies known imaginatively as ""runners.""

Elvis (Scott Peat) meets Tweeter (Marissa Merrill) while shortwave dating. They opt to go off to the proverbial zombie free island, only in this film they actually do it. Once there, they discover the island is controlled by a paramilitary group. Walkers will wash up on the beach and have to be re-killed. There is also a very limited food supply as the government has contaminated the soil.

The island is run by Kurt (James C. Burns) who keeps is 17 year old daughter locked up in her room (Corsica Wilson) where every dad wants to keep his teen daughter. Elvis is a paramedic who kills walkers with a sledge hammer and doesn't listen to Peter Gabriel. Typical infighting within the group and occasional zombie infestation fill up the film until the end sequence.

This isn't the worse zombie movie out there. It just doesn't bring much new to the table. Acceptable acting and script. Walmart has the film for $9.96 and personally I would wait until it hits the $5.00 mark.

In fact I jumped at one scene in this one. But I must say it is sorta clunky. And non zombie fans may not be happy with this one. As it's got the lowest of budgets. The zombies look like it was part of 'zombie lake' which is from 1980 and alot cheesier than this. This is NOT cheesy, it's just that they have people get through mobs of 40 zombies just by walking through them. in some scenes and then others similiar scenes the mob gets the cast member. That was clunky to be sure. The filmmaking at least used film and doesn't jerk around or use a hand camera. The lead actress is the best one in this flick , she does a good job, the male lead is decent too. These people at least seem to have had some experience before. maybe not though. Still their is a big problem of living on a radioactive island that is not in the pacific.  Because that's where all the nuke tests were done. And who would pick such a island to go to? even in a zombie apocalypse? Anyways if  you don't like very low budget movies made by non studios then skip this as it's got limited money to spend on anything.

The photography is excellent, locations are well chosen and the acting is really fantastic.  I thought the pacing was a little disjointed and that the story could have benefited with more humor, but the Cast & Crew commentary definitely makes up for that!  If you check out this movie, be sure to listen to the commentary!  It seems to be three of the crew and one of the main actors just getting drunk and talking about their experience.  I normally don't listen to commentaries because they can be boring, but listening to this while watching the movie made it seem like I was hanging out with a room full of friends.  The outtakes were hilarious as well.

If you're a horror fan, I think you'll be pleased with watching this - gritty and tropical, great scares and a pretty intriguing plot that leaves room for potentially more.

The movie had a lot of story telling but didn't fill in all the answers but they had many questions. For example, there was a scenes where the main girl found video tapes and secretly started to watch the tapes. One of the tape showed a zombie being operated on. They said that if you try amputation the person will still live, but will still become a zombie later on. Okay, what the heck was the point of that? We don't need to see that scene at all because they never tried anything like that during the whole movie.  That's just one tape too because she watched other tapes and it didn't go anywhere with the story either.

I really like the people they used for the zombies. They were really unbelievable. Also, at the end, somehow they went from slow moving zombies to fast running ones. I don't know why they did that, but they asked the question it happened, but never explained why it became like that.

If you have not watched the TV series Walking Dead, you are really missing a zombie movie that is very well written and well done. I was surprised myself.",1345420800,,427,3.8636363636363638
5105158,3,B007R5A1FA,"Is there anything original left to do with the Zombie genre?  I can't answer that, because I have no idea, but if there IS anything new that nobody's tried yet, it's not in this film.  If you've seen the George Romero films, if you've seen the Lucio Fulci films, etc., then you're sure to have seen everything in this film before.  Well, maybe the ""harvesting"" is something different, but it's not an entirely new idea and it's pretty nasty.  I had already figured that one out before they revealed the ""secret"".  Anyway, some disaster happens, people are trying to escape, some make it to an island, the island is run by a stereotypical ex-military dude, there's a small compound where some of the last humans alive hang out, there's walkers outside, etc.  This film does have its moments but overall I just watched it with little reaction, it's not overly exciting and while technically good, it's just not a rousing film.  The characters are just not involving either, and I really felt nothing for anything of them. If you have to watch every zombie film there is, then please, by all means, go ahead, but otherwise, there's nothing new here.  3 out of 5 stars.",1345420800,2,1165,4.648780487804878
5105159,5,B007R5A1FA,"It's not the best zombie movie I've ever seen but it is way better than most of the stuff I've recently watched.  It is definitely worth at least the rental price.  Super entertaining.  Good action and really great acting from the leads.  The background actors could have been better, but what do you expect? Also wish they showed more of the outbreak itself in the beginning as it started out a little slow.  Gore was excellent and so was the location, very creepy and interesting story. The two girls in the movie are pretty too.  It's more of a 4 or 4.5 star movie but I gave it 5 because I've been seeing so much zombie trash lately and this was refreshing.  Again it is not the greatest, but it's really damn good.",1344902400,,719,4.360902255639098

However, unlike Boyle's terrific film, the caliber of the writing, directing, effects, and in some places, the acting is poor in ""Dead Season"". There are huge logical holes. Characters do incredibly stupid things. There is gratuitous (and unconvincing) gore, and gratuitous nudity. Hell, entire scenes just feel unnecessary in this movie.

But it does bring some interesting moral conflicts to the table and does raise the question: what would YOU do to stay alive?

So while this is not going to be something I watch again, I didn't feel it was a complete waste of time. There were some good scenes, some gut-wrenching decisions made by generally likable characters, and some moderately good action sequences. Enough to push me into three-star territory in my review.
