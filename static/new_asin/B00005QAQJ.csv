1646250,5,B00005QAQJ,"This had to be the most important PPV of the year besides WM x-seven, because it would decide what entity would survive. The WWF or the WCW/ECW Alliance. The theme song for this PPV is ""control"" from Puddle Of Mud, Not my first choice for a theme, but then again not horrible, alright i'll rate the matches 1-5 stars and review them.
1) WWF European Championship
Christian (champion) Vs. Al Snow
This match was pretty much a bonus because it was made on sunday night heat, good opener but pointless match, good match overall.
2.5 stars out of 5
2) Tajiri Vs. Alliance Commisioner Willaim Regal
Another decent match, after the match ends Regal feels the need to keep returning to the ring to lay it on Tajiri some more, it gets to the point where u just say to yourself, ""go away please""
2.5 stars out of 5
3)Championship Unification Match
Edge (WCW U.S. Champion) Vs. Test (WWF Intercontinental champion) The winner of this match was to keep there job no matter the out come of the Winner Take All Match. A really good bout with some high spots. Edge wins which latter sets up Test joining the Immunity battle royal to try and secure his job.
3 out of 5 stars.
4)Steel Cage Tag Team Unification Match
Hardy Boyz (WWF Tag Team Champions) Vs. Dudly Boyz (WCW Tag Team Champions) Awesome match with a dramatic finish, matt Hardy climbs over the cage, whick is a foolish mistake and leaves his brother alone, when Jeff climbs to the top to escape and win he decides to take a foolish chance and dive off the cage threw Bubba on the table, Bubba moves and Jeff gets wood, Dudlyz win.
4 out of 5 stars.
5)Immunity Invitational Battle Royal
Featuring 22 WCW/ECW and WWF superstars
Before the match Test beats up Scotty 2 Hotty in the back and takes his spot in the battle royal. Whichs makes it kinda obvious who is going to win, but you never know with the WWF. This isn't exactly WM x-seven. Anyways Test wins and gains immunity for 1 year, meaning he cant be fired for a year.
4.5 stars out of 5
6) Six Pack challenge for the Women's Tile
Lita Vs. Jaqueline Vs. Trish Vs. Ivory Vs. Molly Holly Vs. Jazz
Good womens bought for the title, ends when trish uses the Stratusfaction for the win, (Wow is she hot lol)
3 out of 5 stars.
7)Team WWF vs. Team Alliance
Winner Take All Elimination Match
Team WWF: The Rock, Chris Jericho, Undertaker, Kane, Bigshow
Team Alliance: Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Rob van Dam, Booker T, and Shane Mcmahon.
Here we go, the match most of us have been waiting for, hoping that the Alliance would come to an end, This match didn't fail to deliver, with numerous high spots, the biggest high spot, the ending. When it is down to The Rock and Austin. Kurt Angle comes down to the ring and hits Austin right in the head with his own Title. It is truly an awesome ending, Kurt angle acted as the mole for the past month to help the WWF rid the Alliance. Another high spot to me was to see Paul Heyman's stupid expression after he realized he was out of a job, kodak moment.
5 out of 5 stars no doubt.
DVD Extras: Yes DVD Extras! about time.
1st extra is A day of a WWF superstar. Which is Edge talking about how he became a wrestler ETC...
2nd Extra: After Math on Raw. This is everything important that happened the following night on raw. the firing of Paul Heyman, Vince calling for security to take his princess away, and Regal joining the Vince Mcmahon kiss my rear club. (dont watch ehhhh nasty..) The final little extra is the concluding moments of raw where Rick Flair (woooooooo) comes into the WWF to tell Vince that they are now partners. After that Austin comes out and dominates Angle and Vince and gets his Belt back, Austin and Flair then drink a beer together.
5 star PPV no doubt, thanks for bearing with me and reading this very long review, but at least you got the fullest of what to expect if you purchase this DVD, get it now and watch the Alliance finally die.",1012262400,11,3912,4.382393397524072
1646251,5,B00005QAQJ,"If you're hoping to get some nice special features - backstage interviews, commentary tracks, storylines leading into the event - you won't find them.  This is without a doubt the WEAKEST dvd the WWF has released, in terms of special features, so if that's what you're looking for, don't waste your money, because all you'll get is footage of what happened the night AFTER the Survivor Series, which you should've seen already anyways.
HOWEVER, if you want a pretty good ppv, and prefer it on dvd - as I do - then definitely get this.  Granted, my opinon is somewhat biased, seeing as how I was sitting front row for this event, but I think it was still a good show overall - how many other times can you witness the FINAL death of WCW?",1012176000,,736,4.444444444444445
1646252,5,B00005QAQJ,"What a pay-per-view!  In my humble opinion, this has got to be the best pay-per-view of the year, however I have not seen WWF: Vengeance yet.
The Survivor Series had a great deal of excellent matches.
First Match: WWF European Championship.  Christian puts his title on the line against Al Snow.  I give this match **** stars.  Both men are extremely talented and this was a well faught match and the spots were hit just right.
Second Match:  Tajiri Vs. William Reagal.  This match did not last long at all.  I say it lasted at most 5 minutes, which is good, because I think Regal is overrated and I hate seeing, however he is an excellent wrestler.  The match does have a [bad] ending.  I give this match ** stars.
Third Match:  WCW U.S. Title and WWF Intercontinental Unification
This was Edge putting his Intercontinental title against Test's U.S. title to unify the belts.  This match made up for the Tajiri and Reagal.  One of the best matches to date.  This was a superb match with many high spots and one of the best endings of the night.  I give it ***** stars!
Fourth Match: Steel Cage Tag Team Championship Unification Match
Hardy Boyz Vs. Dudley Boyz.  This was an excellent match with more high spots and a great ending to a great match.  I give it ****1/2 stars.
Fifth Match:  Immunity Battle Royal
  What can I say, it was a battle royal.  Whoever won got to keep their job, despite who won the ""Winner Take All"" match later that night.  Surprising ending, not the best battle royal I have ever seen, but nonetheless, a good match.  I give it ***1/2 stars.
Sixth Match: Six-pack challenge for the Women's title
Trish Stratus VS. Ivory VS. Lita VS. Molly Holly VS. Jacqueline VS. ?  It is a secret.  I normally do not put too much time into women's championship matches, but this is definately an exception.  This was the best women's title match I have seen in a long while.  The moves were pulled off more effectively, and it too, like other matches, had a surprise ending.  This match gets ****1/2 stars in my book.
Seventh Match:  Team WWF Vs. Team Alliance ""Winner Take All""
This was the moment we had all been waiting for.  Whoever lost the match would lose their job and lose a spot in the wrestling wars.
Team WWF  Team Alliance
The Rock  VS.  Stone Cold
Big Show  Kurt Angle
Chris Jericho  Booker T.
Undertaker  Rob Van Dam
Kane  Shane McMahon
This was an AWESOME MATCH!  The match lasted over an hour.  It was an elimination match to end all elimination matches!  This had a great ending, many high spots, and a great storyline going into the match.  This match gets ***** stars out of 5.  The perfect match!
This pay-per-view is worth seeing and spending the money for.  It is a great installment in the WWF Home Video collection.  I reccommend it for anyone who has a WWF Home Video Library. like I do.  Thanks for your time, and I didn't want to go too much into the matches, because I would just might ruin the excitement.  IT IS A MUST HAVE!  Thanks.",1011830400,,2978,4.461824953445065

This is a historic pay-per-view in every sense of the world.  Four sets of championships (from WWF and WCW) are unified... and five of WCW's best face five of WWF's best in a Survivor Series match that brings new meaning to the word SURVIVAL!  If you love wrestling or know someone who does, order this DVD ASAP.",1006300800,2,550,4.881720430107527
1646319,3,B00005QAQJ,"The Survivor Series was a good ppv to end this Invasion feud between the WWF and the Alliance that started back in June. The event also hosted two unification matches and an immunity battle royal. I felt the ppv was good but not as good as other reviewers thought it was.

1. European Title
Christian vs. Al Snow
A pretty average match and nothing more. The match had a few counters and wrestling. Just a decent contest between these two. 3/5

2. Tajiri vs. William Regal
This match was slightly better than the first match. Regal gets a little bloody here. Tajiri looked pretty good. Good match. 3.5/5

3. Unification Match
IC champion Test vs. US champion Edge
Out of the whole night, I felt this match was the most competitve of the night. Test looked very good and on key and so did edge. Edge and Test gave a good performance. They pulled off some good counters and came out with some good maneuvers. A great looking match. Not the best of the night but pretty close. 4.5/5

4. Unification Steel Cage Match
WCW Tag Team champions Dudley Boyz vs. WWF Tag Team champions Hardy Boyz
Not a total bloodbath as cage matches suppose to be. It was more physical than anything. Hardys used their quickness and steadiness to counter the bigger and powerful team of the dudleys. A table would somehow sneak itself into the match and get use. It had a questionable ending that floated over to vengeance between the Hardy brothers. A good match to unify the tag belts. 4.5/5

5. Immunity Battle Royal
This featured superstars from the WWF and the Alliance fighting for immunity to stay in the business. The crowd was a little dead in this match. It had a couple of good elimination spots but nothing that great. This also had a few surprised appearences but it could have been better. 3/5

6. Women's Title
Lita vs. Trish Stratus vs. Ivory vs. Molly Holly vs. Jazz vs. Jacqueline
This was a six pack challenge among the divas where they had to make tags to enter the match. It had a couple of good spots but I felt this match was only average as well. Trish had a nice counter into her stratisfaction for the win. 3/5

7. Winner Take All Survivor Series Elimination Match
Team WWF- The Rock/Undertaker/Kane/Chris Jericho/Big Show vs. Team Alliance- Stone Cold/Booker T/Kurt Angle/Shane McMahon/RVD
This match was a perfect way to end this Alliance Invasion rivalry. It started out with probably two of the most fan favorites in the Rock and Austin. Shane got a little annoying after interfering in so many of the pinning combinations. I felt it was a good fit to let Shane and Big Show to be the first two eliminated.

After the first two eliminations, the match progressed at a good pace and the next eliminations came at good times. The two teams would brawl for a while. Y2J and Rock continued their little feud in this match which carried over to the Royal Rumble. Rock and Stone Cold put on a great performance being the final two. A fitting end to close out this great Invasion feud. 5/5

I suggest picking up Survivor Series. Great main event with a decent under card.",1224201600,,3067,4.5618181818181816
1646320,4,B00005QAQJ,"The Invasion angle was a good storyline. Its too bad WWE never really got big WCW stars to promote it. Only after the angle was all over did Scott Steiner, Goldberg, Rey Mysterio, and Ric Flair come in it was all over. They did however put on some excellent PPVS thru out the whole year this was no different.

Christian vs. Al Snow: Christian was always good on the microphone. He was good in tag matches with Edge. As a singles wrestler though, he is just anther wrestler. Decent match but nothing speical.

Tajiri vs. William Regal: Tajiri was never used well in the WWE. A decent match.

Championship Unification Match: IC Champion Edge vs. US Champion Test: I never ever like either wrestler.

Steel Cage Tag Team Unification Match: WWF Tag Team champions Dudley Boyz vs. WCW Tag Team Champions Hardy Boyz: These two teams always tear it up when the face one anther. A good match but not one of there best.

Immunity Battle Royal: Test bullies himself into the event and wins. A Raw match on a PPV.

Trish Stratus vs. Jacqueline vs. Mighty Molly vs. Lita vs. Ivory vs. Jazz: Yawn.

Right now im thinking- is this PPV ever going pick up? So far its a basic Raw show with more matches.

Team WWF-The Rock,Big Show,Undertaker,Kane, & Y2J vs. Team Alliance-Stone Cold,Booker T,RVD,Shane O' Mac, & Kurt Angle: This match went almost an hour. A very good match with lots of back and fourth action. Angle turns on WCW and heads back to WWE.

Some good bonus footage after the event. A really bad card but the main event is worth it.",1196294400,,1530,4.5144927536231885

1646322,5,B00005QAQJ,"After months of diddering about within the WWF, the Alliance was starting to look less like an Invasion of WCW and ECW superstars to me, and more like a massive heel stable just there to tease the audience with old memories of WCW and ECW and how much the WWF sucks.

Before going on match by match analysis, I have to sum up Paul Heyman.  Not just for this event, but since he first joined the WWF as color commentator alongside Jim Ross, he has been one of the absolute best commentators I have ever heard.  His mocking of JR and imitating him is ripe and hilarious, his comments, ranging from coy to innocent to downright brutal, are fun to hear and he really absorbs himself fully into the job of commentating.  He was a fantastic commentator and one of the absolute best I've ever heard.

WWF European Championship
Christian (C) vs Al Snow
This match was far from horrible but I had a hard time getting in to it.  Al Snow is notorious for being made fun of by Mick Foley constantly, and his minimal pushing in the WWF makes it even harder to find genuine Al Snow fans.  This match was a good one, certainly beyond the caliber of WWE matches today.  (6/10)

Tajiri vs William Regal
This one had a rapidly quick pace, for the reason that it was hardly longer than an average Raw or Smackdown match.  Literally only 3 minutes, which saw Regal start bleeding from the mouth, then powerbomb Tajiri and Torrie Wilson after the match was over.  (6/10)

Unification Match
WCW United States Championship and WWF Intercontinental Championship
Edge vs Test
Edge did his best, but Test is not a great wrestler to watch.  This match wasn't so much a dud, but it was not great, and not worth the 11 minutes it was given.  (4/10)

Unification Cage Match
WCW Tag Team Championship and WWF Tag Team Championship
The Dudley Boys vs The Hardy Boys
With these two teams in a cage match on the biggest night of the storyline, you have to expect wonders.  The first few minutes were somewhat dull, despite the lively pace the Hardys and Dudleys kept up, but as soon as they started ditching the tag team stipulation and fighting Tornado style, it became one of those great classic matches that saw high spot after high spot, and ended with heartbreak as the winning side took a high risk and blew it, and lost the match for his brother.  (10/10)

Immunity Battle Royal
Billy Gunn, Bradshaw, Faarooq, Lance Storm, Billy Kidman, Tazz, Albert, Perry Saturn, Raven, Diamond Dallas Page, The Hurricane, Funaki, Chavo Guerrero Jr, Hugh Morrus, Spike Dudley, Shawn Stasiak, Crash Holly, Steven Richards, Tommy Dreamer, Chuck Palumbo, Test, Justin Credible  all participated.

Like any Battle Royal, it was quick, and sometimes painful to watch.  But like any Battle Royal, it delivered what it promised, and the surprise end saw the loser of a previous match come up the winner.  (6/10)

Winner Take All Classic Survivor Series Match
The Rock, The Undertaker, Kane, Chris Jericho, The Big Show, Team WWF vs Team Alliance, Shane McMahon, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Booker T, Rob Van Dam
This match was given 45 minutes, and was everything the WWF was about.  It had decent wrestling, including some great wrestling by RVD and Jericho, great power wrestling by The Big Show, Kane, and The Undertaker, and amazing technical, brawling, and extreme athleticism and charisma by the rest.  The entire affair was like a 45 minute drama, with different phases going along, starting with Shane McMahon breaking up every WWF pinfall attempt, to the intense drama of the last minutes.  This was everything any WWF fan could ask for in a match.  Epic is fitting for this match, and the absolutely perfect send-off to the last great WWF storyline.  It's obvious who's going to win, but the action and drama is so palpable, you'll find yourself on edge when The Rock is on the brink of losing the match for the WWF, and leaping to your feet when The Rock pins Austin.  It's simply a classic.  (10/10)

The end of the war is here, and what a splendid send-off it is.  While the final battle was most billed and hyped up (deservedly so) the other matches were worthy of viewing, and the cage match could have been a main event in its own right.",1187913600,,4213,4.628532974427995
1646323,4,B00005QAQJ,"The final battle between WWF & The Alliance takes place here as one ""company"" will go out of business once this event is over.  Despite your opinion of how WWF handled this ""invasion"" storyline, they did a great job with this PPV & it was one of the best ones from 2001 thoughout this WWF vs. WCW/ECW war.

WWF European Champion Christian vs. Al Snow - This was thrown together on Heat before the show so it didn't really have much buildup or a reason for the fans to care but overall, they had an average encounter but this wasn't a good opener.

Tajiri vs. William Regal - If you saw their match at Rebellion, you know these two could put on a good match but this match wasn't given much time to become something special or really good.  It's watchable but needed more time.

Unification Match: WCW U.S. Champion Edge vs. WWF Intercontinental Champion Test - Test continued what was his best year in the business in this match with Edge as they both delievered a good performance here that lived up to the buildup & hype it was given.

Steel Cage/Unification Match: WCW Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs. WWF Tag Team Champions Hardy Boyz - I know some people compared this to their TLC matches but this was able to stand out on it's own and it wasn't one of those ""bloddy massacre"" cage matches.  These two don't disappoint anytime they're allowed to go one on one in a tag team match and this is the same as well.  Jeff's highdive off the top of the cage though the table was something to see as well.

Immunity Battle Royal - There were a couple of comedic spots such as Shawn Stasiak being the first one eliminated & Paul Heyman being scared to death of Tazz but besides that, your basic battle royal with Test winning in the end after attacking Scotty 2 Hotty beforehand.

Womens Championship 6 pack challenge: Lita vs. Trish Stratus vs. Jacqueline vs. Ivory vs. Mighty Molly vs. Jazz - This was to declare a new Womens Champion after Chyna had left the company as champion & also Jazz debut match in WWF.  This was a great mix of womens wrestling (before it was T&A eye candy like today) and the beginnings of Trish Stratus becoming the top diva in WWF/E for years to come.  Not everyone had time to get their spots in but it was good overall mix with the underdog in Trish Stratus winning the gold in the end.

Winner Take All Elimination Match: The Rock, Undertaker, Kane, Chris Jericho, Big Show vs. Stone Cold, Booker T, Rob Van Dam, Kurt Angle, Shane McMahon - This match was one of the best matches of the year as it was given plenty of time to develop into something good & didn't have a bunch of fluke eliminations like elimination matches have had in the past.  The beginning was a bit humorous with Jim Ross getting pissed off on the commentary with Shane McMahon constantly breaking up pinfall attempts followed by both Show & McMahon being eliminated from the match after being hit by all the finishing moves from the other team.  Other than that, all the eliminations were believeable & so many storyline twist & suprizes came about such as Jericho finally turning heel & almost costing Team WWF the match and Kurt Angle revealing himself to be the ""mole"" and helping The Rock beat Austin for the final finish...and the end of the WCW/ECW alliance.

1646362,4,B00005QAQJ,"For months, the WWF had been competing with a WCW/ECW Invasion.  This angle was a war, with constant back-and-forth action, equal amounts of losses & victories, and both factions periodically losing wrestlers to the other team.

After several teases leading up to this angle, the rivalry officially kicked off with the July 2001 PPV called INVASION.  What better way to end an ""invasion"" than at an event called SURVIVOR SERIES?

1) WWF European Championship
Christian (champion) v. Al Snow
---This is such a strange match to have on a night where a pro wrestling company will end.  But it doesn't matter.  After Christian taunted the crowd (he called the Greensboro crowd ""South Carolinans""), Al Snow entered to begin the scheduled opener.  While nothing memorable, this was a very solid way to get a show going.  I'd argue this was Snow's last notable match while working in the WWE.  Just a nice back-and-forth contest, which all we need from an opener.
""7.0 / 10""

***Backstage, Vince & Linda McMahon talk about the night's implications, when the WCW/ECW Alliance Commissioner, William Regal, does some gentleman-ly smack talk.  If we only knew what Vince said when he responded, ""$H!T Happens.""  Oh...if we only knew what Regal was in for.***

2) William Regal (WCW/ECW Alliance Commissioner) v. Tajiri
---First off, let me say that this is an entertaining match that will please most fans.  It's short, but never boring.  The big problem I have is that two weeks prior at the UK's REBELLION PPV, these two men delivered a stiff contest that was twice as long, and much more impressive.  But if you can ignore that factoid, then this is a pleasant 6 minutes to kill.
""7.0 / 10""

3) Title-Unification Match
Test (WWF Intercontinental champion) v. Edge (WCW United States champion)
---The biggest problem with the ""Invasion"" angle was that factions often held their opponent's titles, making things tough to keep track of.  Test was with the WCW/ECW, and Edge was loyal ot the WWF.  But the best part of the ""Invasion"" were the variety of matches we got to see, such as this one.  Test & Edge were in WWF for a few years already, but rarely mixed it up.  I'd call this their best match together.  Years ago, Test was a very athletic big-man wrestler, capable of great things if given the chance.  And Edge is -- let's face it -- a modern legend.  The match is even handed between the two opponents, made even better by the fact that either man could've won at multiple occasions.
""7.0 / 10""
____________________________________________

4) Steel Cage Match
Titles-Unification Match
The Dudley Boyz (WWF Tag Team champions)
v. The Hardy Boyz (WCW Tag Team champions)
---While not their best match together, these two teams have set the bar so high that it's easy to forget how good this particular Cage Match really is.  Simply put, all four men use the Cage stipulations well, going for pinfalls as well as escape attempts.  One thing that irked me a little was that this never felt like it belonged on this PPV.  Granted, it was a titles-for-titles ordeal, with one team potentially out of a job, but once the bell rings, you forget you're watching the ""Winner Take All SURVIVOR SERIES PPV"".  But that's just a minor nitpick from someone who's watched way too much WWF TV.  If you like watching The Dudleyz and The Hardyz work together, then you're in for a fun time.  But there's one last thing I want to let you in on: the finish is one of the best is recent memory.
""7.0 / 10""
____________________________________________

5) Immunity Battle Royal (Winner Will Not Be Fired For 1 Year)
---Thankfully, this was one of those Battle Royals where everyone was doing something to keep things fresh.  What's kinda funny about this one was that two wrestlers who weren't supposed to be in the match entered themselves in anyway, and Tazz's loyalty was in question, made worse by Paul Heyman's goofish commentary.  If you like these kinds of matches, then you'll enjoy yourself.  I've personally seen better, and I've seen way worse.
""6.0 / 10""
____________________________________________

6) Six Pack Challenge for the Women's Championship
Trish Stratus v. Jacqueline v. Lita v. Ivory v. Mighty Molly v. Jazz
---There was actually quite a bit of intrigue when this one got booked.  This title had been vacated since Chyna left the company in May 2001.  The 6th wrestler (Jazz) was a secret until she made her entrance on this PPV; despite not getting much reaction from the crowd, she was easily the most crisp & aggressive of these ladies.  And even though this match tended to play out as a 3-on-3 matchup, we soon remembered that these Divas might turn on their respective factions.  The match itself was pretty solid, because the action is constantly moving, and much smoother compared to other women's matches.  Overall, a nice way to get eye candy & female competition.
""7.0 / 10""

***Both the WCW/ECW Alliance and Team WWF got their motivational speeches in, making this probably the most epic & most hyped main event from its time.  On a side note, I always laugh at Vince McMahon's speech to Team WWF, where everyone is standing still, while The Rock is jumping for the ENTIRE speech!  It's funny to see Big Show standing still, Kane standing still, Undertaker standing still, Chris Jericho standing still......AND THE ROCK JUST CONSTANTLY JUMPING IN PLACE!  Never mind...***

Kurt Angle, & 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin (WWF champion)
***V.***
TEAM WWF
Big Show, Kane, The Undertaker, Chris Jericho, & The Rock (WCW champion)

---There's so much to describe that I'd take forever to do it justice.  So, I'm gonna do a bullet-point style breakdown:
* What's with all of the multiple-finisher finishes?
* It's hilarious to see the factions react backstage while their team members lose or defeat a team member.
* Man, that Shane McMahon can be a real annoyance if given too much time.
* With the exception of Shane & Big Show, each wrestler does some very good in-ring work.
* How did Undertaker lose that suddenly?
* The final four (a two-on-two scenario) is the best part of the match, with plenty of near-falls & smart tag team wrestling.
* I think Rock/Austin confrontations are overrated, but this was very exciting.
* Was I the only one who didn't guess who the traitor was?  I'm such a mark that I can't predict these twists.
""7.5 / 10""

***EXTRAS***
The WWF wisely included the four RAW segments that involved Vince McMahon, the night after the WWF won.  Sorry, was that a spoiler?
You don't get to see Mick Foley quitting, which opened the RAW show.  However, you will get to watch:
* Paul Heyman being fired, punched by Jim Ross, and replaced by Jerry Lawler.
* Shane McMahon accepting that he lost, while Stephanie futilely tries to remain in Vince's good graces.
* Vince McMahon creates a most embarassing club, with William Regal as his first member.  As Vince said at the PPV, ""$H!T Happens.""
* Vince McMahon attempting to strip Steve Austin of his belt (he wasn't in the arena), and give it to another wrestler.  Instead, Vince finds himself a new partner...Ric Flair!  Now THAT'S a RAW moment for the history books!

Hardy Dudley match was alright. Especially when idiot Jeff did a Swanton off the Cage though the Table and missed DVON. Idiot could've climbed out and won the WWF and WCW tag titles but no.. he did a Sawnton and missed.

1646447,4,B00005QAQJ,"The story behind the 2001 Survivor Series was the end of the Invasion angle between the WWF and the WCW. In real life, the WWF purchased the WCW (a rival wrestling company). The televised story of this was that Vince McMahon was intending to purchase the WCW, but his son Shane went behind his back and bought WCW himself. His sister, Stephanie, purchased another rival federation the ECW (which is actually in bankruptcy court, still). Shane and Stephanie tried to take over the WWF and put their father out of business. The WWF and WCW had their own championships and after several months of competition, Survivor Series would decide which company stays in business. This would be decided in a traditional 5 on 5 Survivor Series elimination match.
Since this PPV would eliminate one company, the championship belts would be merged (excluding the respective heavyweight titles, as both champions were in the elimination main event). The Intercontinental (WWF) and U.S. (WCW) titles would be unified in a decent match between Edge (WWF) and Test (WCW). The Tag Team titles would be unified in a Steel Cage match between the Hardy Boyz (WWF) and the Dudley Boyz (ECW). This match was very good and ended with an incredible leap from the top of the cage through a table set up in the middle of the ring. There was also a 22 Man Battle Royal where the winner would be granted immunity from being fired (no matter which company survived) for one year. It was a battle royal and was a time-filler. Not that interesting. The women's championship match between Ivory and Lita was blah with the only interesting thing happening when Lita was cut above her eye and had blood covering half her face. One of the more entertaining matches of the night was for the European Championship and was between Al Snow and Christian. I know, Al Snow being a highlight of the night? Yes. The match was fairly fast paced and was a bit more interesting than most of the others on the card.
The Main Event was the 5 on 5 elimination match. Team WWF consisted of The Rock(WCW Champion), The Undertaker, Kane, Chris Jericho, and The Big Show. The Alliance (WCW/ECW) had Stone Cold Steve Austin (WWF Champion), Kurt Angle, Booker T, Rob Van Dam, and Shane McMahon. This match had more time to tell an in-ring story and all the wrestlers had a chance to perform their big moves at least once. The match was better than most elimination style matches and provided a swerve as one wrestler switched teams during the match.
Overall, the 2001 Survivor Series was much better than in 2000 and was more of an event with high quality matches.",1042675200,4,2606,4.692139737991266

Jeff tries to hit a swanton bomb off the cage onto D-von thru a table, but D-von moves and Jeff goes crashin thru the table, givin the dudleyz the win. ***
Battle Royal.  Nothing special in this match.  The only good spots i remember is Bradshaw's Fallaway slam over the top rope, and Test hittin the big boot to knock Billy over the rope for the win, and not be fired if WCW looses. **
Women's title match: Lita vs Jacqueline vs Trish vs Ivory vs Mighty Molly vs Jazz.  Nothin real big in this match.  Trish wins with the Stratusfaction on Ivory. *
Winner Takes All match! Team WWE: The Rock, Jericho, Undertaker, Kane, and Big Show, vs Team Alliance: SCSA, Angle, RVD, Booker T, and Shane.  This match had some great spots, and unbelievable stuff in there.  Austin and The Rock are the two left, and Kurt shocks the world by getting the WWF title, and nailing Austin with it(fans going nuts) and Austin gettin the Rock Bottom right after and WWE wins!!!  WWE backstage celebratin and fans going nuts!!*****

Christian v. Al Snow
 This match surprised me, and was probably one of the best matches from Al Snow ever.  9/10
Edge v. Test
 Another good match.  A great rollup ending.  8.5/10
William Regal v. Tajiri
 Tajiri kicked Regal in the nose one minute into this short match, and Regal bled for about the rest of the match.  Great match, but too much attacking afterwards.  8.5/10
Hardy Boyz v. Dudley Boyz  CAGE TAG TEAM
 So many spots off of the cage, a swanton, a bubba bomb, russian leg sweep just to name a few.  As good if not better than most of these tag matches.  9/10
6 pack Woman title
 Jazz v. Ivory v. Mighty Molly v. Lita v. Jackie v. Trish
  A new women's star is born, for a women's match it is a 10.
IMMUNITY battle royal
 i am a fan of any battle royal so a 9/10.
WWF v. ALLIANCE
The Rock, Y2J, Big Show, Kane, Taker
  v.
Steve Austin, Angle, Booker T, RVD, and Shane O' Mac
 An hour long match that wasn't even long enough.  20 specials were done to everyone, and two people turning at the end makes for the best match that i have ever seen minus the recent ELIMINATION CHAMBER.

1646450,5,B00005QAQJ,"It finally came at Survivor Series 2001 to decide which wrestling company would stay in business. The WWE or the Alliance! What a great Survivor Series with great matches! This was a big night with a lot on the line, including the Winner Take All match. My review for each match are down below.
WWE European title match
Christian vs. Al Snow
Okay opener with a couple of good moves by both men. But why was Al Snow at this PPV? Could have been better if it was Maven at his first PPV going up against Christian instead of Al.
Tajiri vs. William Regal
Good match but too short.
Championship Unification match
Edge vs. Test
Pretty slow and boring at the beginning, but fast pace action towards the end.
Steel Cage Tag Team Unification match
Hardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz
Hardyz + Dudleyz + Steel Cage match = TREMENDOUS PAIN! This was a great match with both teams going at it. The ending is incredible.
Immunity Battle Royal
Not a very good match with a few good spots. The end of the match ruined the outcome of the main event.
6 pack challenge for the Women's title
Lita vs. Ivory vs. Jaqueline vs. Mighty Molly vs. Trish Stratus vs. Jazz
A lot of people said this match was bad, what where they thinking!? This match was great with all six women battling it out.
Winner Take All elimination match
Team WWE vs. Team Alliance
Two words, ABSOLUTELY GREAT!
Overall this was the best Survivor Series ever!",1037491200,6,1399,4.46875
1646451,5,B00005QAQJ,"How good was Survivor Series? It was great!!
WWF European title Match
Christian def. Al Snow
This match saw the return of Tough Enough trainer Al Snow who proved in this match that he's still got it. Although it had no background it was still a great match to kick of SS. ***
William Regal def. Tajiri
Mentor vs. pupil, an exciting match between two completely different styles, poor Torrie though. ***
WWF Intercontinental and WCW US title match
Edge def. Test
Another great match between two athletes who will be in main events before long. No more US title, oh well. ***
Steel Cage match for the WWF and WCW Tag Team titles
Dudley Boyz def. Hardy Boyz
I'd say the third best match on the card was this one. By now you would think that this Dudley/Hardy thing would get boring but it's far from that, it's downright exciting. A great climax with Jeff falling from the top of the cage. ****
Test wins immunity battle royal
This match was just to fill a gap really and for some of the lower card wrestlers to get some action and to put Test over. Crash Holly is kinda annoying, i love it when he loses to Jacqueline. Test wins easily really. ***
Six Pack Challenge for the WWF Women's title
Trish Stratus def. Jacqueline, Ivory, Lita, Mighty Molly & Jazz
The best women's match i have seen in ages. Finally Ivory and Jackie are getting onto PPV!! All of the divas get some action and Trish finally gets the win with her bulldog. *****
Winner take all match
The Rock, Undertaker, Chris Jericho, Kane & Big Show def. Stone Cold Steve Austin, Shane McMahon, Kurt Angle, Booker T & Rob Van Dam
Fantastic main event. Big Slow...Show gets eliminated first as usual by Shane (who else?). Shane goes next thanks to Jericho. Kane, Booker, RVD and Undertaker are soon eliminated too. Angle is then eliminated. Leaving it a handicap match, but Austin soon takes out Jericho. It comes down to Rock vs. Austin (who would have guessed) and finally the Rock gets the win and so WWF survive. *****

1646493,4,B00005QAQJ,"Let's keep this one focused on reviews of the matches. Here we go.
1) Al Snow vs. Christian- Really good match but 6 minutes way too short for these guys who can work 20. Snow works really hard to show the crowd that he still has it after 19 years in the ring. The top spot has to be the Snow Plow. Rating- 6.8/10
2) Tajiri vs William Regal- Very short match for two really good workers. I mean it was not even 3 minutes long! That just ... . Rating- DUD
3)Edge(IC champ) vs Test(US Champ)- This was Test's best match in a while because Edge carried his ... so much. I really liked the roll-up finish. 11 minutes was a perfect time for this match. Rating- 8.5/10
4) Hardy Boyz (WWF tag) vs Dudley Boyz (WCW Tag) Cage Match- This match has gotten so many bad reviews that it's not funny. Personally I really liked the match. Jeff misses a Swanton off the top of the cage through a table. The match was timed perfectly at 15:29 Rating- 8/10
5) 22 Man Battle Royal- This was an okay battle royal with very few highspots. The crowd is kinda dead for most of it because no-one cares for the real wrestlers that should be main eventing and not jobbing. Rating- 5/10
6)Trish Stratus, Jackie, Lita, Ivory, Jazz and Molly (Women's Title Six Way)- Jazz is the ""big mystery opponent"" the crowd is deader than dead. Four minutes of so-so action. Rating- 5.2/10
7)Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Kane, The Rock, The Big Show versus Rob Van Dam, Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Shane McMahon, Booker T- One of the five best WWF matches of 2001 in my opinion. This match is 45 minutes of pure action. The match did have one major flaw when Rock rolled up Booker T. Rock did not even have Booker's shoulders pinned correctly for a schoolboy. It looked very bad and the commentators tried covering it up. Let's not get all upset about that though. The last 20 minutes really make up for that spot. Enjoy it, It will not dissapoint. Rating-10/10
Overall View- Not the best Survivior Series but not the Worst. It ranks #5 on my SS list. Check this DVD or Video Tape out. It will not dissapoint unless you are a snobby smart mark.",1033257600,2,2103,4.36734693877551

1646495,5,B00005QAQJ,"Awesome pay-per-veiw! I prayed that WWF whould win, and sure enough... THEY DID! But, the main event wasn't the only great match. For example...
FIRST MATCH: EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: Al Snow vs. Christian
Good match, except for the end. It gets a 6/10.
SECOND MATCH: Tajiri vs. Regal. Regal wins and afterwords continues to beat the meekrob out of Tajiri. Torrie gets involved, and Regal suplexes her. 4/10
THIRD MATCH: IC/U.S CHAMPIONSHIP UNIFICATION MATCH: Test vs. Edge. Amazing match! Test and Edge use body slams, power bombs, and each others moves. Test hits the impaler, covers, 1-2-3! 10/10.
FOURTH MATCH: WCW/WWF TAG TITLE UNIFICATION CAGE MATCH: Hardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz. This match is worth the whole tape! No, seriously! This match has everything but the kitchen sink. You see high-flying moves, tables, high-impact moves and Stacy's butt! Jeff Hardy Swanton's through a table, costing the Hardyz the match. But, it still gets a huge 10/10!
FIFTH MATCH: IMMUNITY BATTLE ROYAL: 22 superstars form both the alliance and the WWF square of for the prize: The winner cannot be fired for one full year. No matter what. Test is still [angry] having lost to Edge earlier. He wins, which [disappoints]! It gets a 5/10.
SIXTH MATCH: WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: Lita vs. Jacqueline vs. Trish vs. Ivory vs. Molly vs. Jazz(?). The only sucky match of the night. It gets a 2/10.
SEVENTH MATCH: WINNER TAKE ALL!: WWF: Rock, Jericho, 'Taker, Kane, Big Show vs. Alliance: Austin, Angle(cry baby), Van Dam, Booker T(Booger T), and Shane(arrogant pissant). Big Show is the first to go he is quantople teamed until Shane gets the 1-2-3. Then Shane gets a Rock Bottem, a chokeslam to Hell, a lionsault, then a tombstone. 1-2-3. Then Kane got taken down with a Five-star splash. 1-2-3. Undertaker gets a stunner. 1-2-3. Then RVD is put in a small package by Rock. 1-2-3. Jericho gets an Angle slam. 1-2-3. Jericho still hates the Rock so he gives him a full nelson frontwards slam, then left. Rock is almost pinned when he kicks out. Rock put Angle in the Sharpshooter. Angle taps after two seconds. So it's down to Austin and Rock. They duke it out for about five minutes when the ref gets knocked out. (Hmm, that happens an awful lot, doesn't it.) When Angle comes out, picks up Austin's belt, and nails Austin with it. Rock gets a Rock Bottom. 1-2-3!!! WWF wins. Alliance dies! the match, and the PPV get a 10/10!",1027641600,2,2412,4.814457831325301

This was a truly great PPV, if for nothing else than the fact that it is the culmination of the war of the Big 3 (WWF,WCW,ECW). Granted, this is the scripted version of the end of the war, but it's significant nonetheless.

1646501,3,B00005QAQJ,"This 15th Survivour Series was WWF's most important PPV of all time and was held in Greensboro North Carolina. Before the actual event started there was a good intro.
Christian and Alsnow kicked things off in a decent opener for the European Championship, nothing special but near the end it does pick up a bit.
-Austin & Team Alliance promo ""will he turn""
-Vince & Linda promo
Regal vs Tarjiri in short match up that could have been better. Starts off with some stiff kicks by Tarjiri  and have a look when Tarjiri gets his neck tied between the rope.
-Test & Stacey promo ""she wants me""
-Edge interview
The 1st unification title match was between Test(i.c.) and Edge(u.s).1 title has to go as these 2 young performers get it on. Test dominates in this match with his smash mouth in your face style of wrestling that does pick up near the end when the crowd gets into it and with a couple of near falls this has a nice ending and the Intercontinental Championship stays. A nice performance from these 2 who could be future maineventers.
-Angle & Stephanie promo ""regular person""
-Team Xtreme promo
The 2nd title unifcation match featured the Dudly Boyz(WCW tag team champs) and Hardy Boyz(WWF tag team champs) in a steel cage match.
These 2 teams have had a history and this will no doubt be apart of it although it wasn't their best encounter. It starts off a little slow but slowly picks up as they all brawl. Dudlyz contolled most of the match. Hardyz didn't leave uninjured as Matt got squashed between the cage and Buh Buh Ray and Jeff done a swanton through a table from top of a cage with impact. A good finish to a good match that also could have been a bit better as there wasn't as many high flying monuvers.
-Mick Foley interview at WWF New York.
-Test assualts Scotty Too Hotty to get in the Immunity Battle Royal.
1st ever IMMUNITY BATTLE ROYAL
Featuring members of Team WWF & Alliance and the winner can not be fired for a year no matter which team wins.
It was nothing to special as the guys didn't put much effort into it. Nice strength by Bradshaw as he chucks Kidman out of the ring with a fallaway slam. Also Billy Gunn gets a boot to the face as Test keeps his job for another year.
-A nice video clip of the WWF by CREED ""My Sacrifice""
-Shane & Booker-t promo
Next was tag team acton featuring 6 women of the WWF for the WWF gold. The 6 women were:Jaqueline vs Trish vs Lita vs Ivory vs Mighty Molly vs Jazz. It was Jazz's 1st appearance in the WWF but didn't get a big obvation, if more people knew her from ECW she would have. This match was short but sweet and a new WWF womens champion is crowned.

BIGSHOW / KANE / UNDERTAKER / CHRIS JERICHO / THE ROCK

  TEAM ALLIANCE
SHANE / BOOKER-T / ROB VAN DAM / KURT ANGLE / STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN
Match kicks off with Rock and Austin and the crowd gets hyped. Shane interupts nearly every  pin but gets tombstoned out of the match. The most impressive out of the 10 was Rob Van Dam and Chris Jericho. At one point it becomes an all out brawl but it does have its slow points. Things to pick up as the guys who kicked it off are finishing it, thats right Rock and Stone Cold once again which is a good thing. It then becomes intense as the 2 refs start getting involved and Angle turns. Rock gets the pin as WWF wipes out the Alliance in a hard fought match.
Paul Heymans face is priceless even though i like the guy. With WWF locker room celebrating and Vince coming out with arms in air  as this historic show closes.
All in All this is a very historic PPV.Most of these guys give it 5 out of 5 because WWF Dominates but some of the wrestlers didn't put in the effort that you would expect in a big PPV.Although it is a must have in your collecton as this is a very historic night but there are better WWF PPV's.",1012953600,2,3930,4.287061994609164
1646502,4,B00005QAQJ,"Well, I just recently purchased Survivor Series and after a very solid No Mercy, I was hoping that the WWF would continue their PPV success. And the WWF did not disappoint. From start to finish, this PPV was very entertaining.
1. WWF European Championship-Christian vs. Al Snow-the buildup for this match wasn't until near the end of the Sunday Night Heat before the PPV. Looking at it, you would think that it's just a PPV card-filler. But in actuality, it was a rather solid match. Al Snow proves that the long lay-off from competition didn't erode his wrestling ability. Nice moves from both superstars-***1/2 stars.
2. William Regal vs. Tajiri-I must admit. I have never enjoyed watching a William Regal match, but this one was above being watchable. With the exception of it being short and a little one-sided, this was an okay match. Nice bump-taking from Regal and  nice ending to the match-**1/2 stars
3. WCW United States Championship/WWF Intercontinental Championship Unification Match-Edge vs. Test- I wasn't too excited about this match, either, but this could have been quite possibly the best match that Test had competed in in the year 2001. Both men worked hard in this match and as a result, it lived up to the hype that it had.-***1/2 stars
4. WCW/WWF Tag Team Championship Steel Cage Unification Match-This match was good but could have been a little better. From what I saw at Royal Rumble 2000 with their table match and the TLC and ladder matches, I was expecting a lot more. However, it wasn't boring as a lot of innovative moves were utilized in that contest. The ending was good and serves as a tool for the brief feud of the Hardyz.-***1/2 stars
5. 20 Man-Immunity Battle Royal-Surprises in this match. Basically a free-for-all with every man fighting for the right to have immunity for 1 year in the WWF, meaning that for 1 year only, whatever they do, they cannot be fired. Nice ending-**1/2 stars
6. Six Pack Challenge for Vacant WWF Women's Championship-Trish vs. Lita vs. Jaqueline vs. Mighty Molly vs. Ivory vs. Mystery Opponent-Another good surprise. All the women worked extremely hard, great match-*** stars
7. Winner-Take-All Elimination Match-This was the one that I had been waiting on. The Alliance vs. The WWF to see who would stay in business. The participants were:
Alliance
Stone Cold Steve Austin
Kurt Angle
Rob Van Dam
Booker T
Shane McMahon
versus
The Rock
Chris Jericho
Undertaker
Kane
Big Show
Great hype to build up the PPV, however the match didn't quite live up to my expectations. Still a great contest. There were nice moves from all Superstars, however this was another PPV in which Shane was almost non-existent in terms of executing moves. Interesting twists and turns in this match and more feuds were made from the match. The ending was good and ironic.-**** stars

7949998,5,B00005QAQJ,"Survivor Series 2001 was the end all, be all, to the near 5 month long Invasion feud between the WWF and The Alliance. Throughout the night there were a few title vs title matches with the winner(s) that unified the titles being guaranteed their job, regardless of which team won the Winner Take All main event. It was an unforgettable PPV that took place in Greensboro and here's the line up

1.) European Championship Match: Al Snow vs Christian (c)

- This opening bout really didn't have any background. There really wasn't any major beef with Al Snow and Christian heading into Survivor Series. This was mostly just a filler match made for there to be a reason to have the European Championship on the PPV. Decent match overall

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) Tajiri w/Torrie Wilson vs William Regal

- Regal and Tajiri had been at each other over the weeks leading to Survivor Series but their feud really didn't escalate until Regal attacked Tajiri's girlfriend, Torrie Wilson on the previous Smackdown, locking her in the Regal Stretch. Tajiri walked into Survivor Series looking for revenge but the match overall didn't live up to the hype that the feud tried to form. The post-match sees Torrie get manhandled by Regal once again

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Championship Unification Match: Edge (WCW US Champion) vs Test (Intercontinental Champion)

- After Test cheated to take the IC Championship away from Edge and Edge managed to defeat Kurt Angle for the US Championship, the two met in this incredibly good unification match. Good is not even the word to give this match the justice it deserves. It was very fast paced with tons of back and forth action from both men. A mix of brawler and high flyer so to speak for this match. Overall a really awesome match!

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Steel Cage Tag Team Unification Championship Match: The Hardy Boyz (WCW Tag Team Champions) vs The Dudley Boyz (WWF Tag Team Champions)

- These 2 teams had been involved in a variety of matches over the last year when it came to the Tag Team Titles. TLC matches, Ladder matches, Table matches. But this would be the first time The Dudleyz and The Hardyz would be battling it out inside of a Steel Cage. This match was pretty good for the most part that saw a few of the usual high flying bumps that you'd expect from these two. At one point in the match, Stacy Keibler seduced the outside referee before stealing the cage door key from him and sliding a table in the ring, which would play a factor in the ending of the match that saw Jeff attempt to take a daredevil dive off the cage onto one of the Dudleyz on the table, but miss and crash through it, losing the match for him and Matt

5.) 22 Immunity Battle Royal: This match featured the mid/lowcard superstars of the WWF and The Alliance competing in this over the top rope battle royal. The winner would be immune to being fired for over a year. Before the match, Test had attacked Scotty 2 Hotty backstage and took his place in the match. Of course, Test ended up winning the match, last eliminating Billy Gunn to ensure himself his job for the next year

6.) 6 Pack WWF Women's Championship Challenge: Mighty Molly vs Trish Stratus vs Jacqueline vs Ivory vs Lita vs Jazz

- The Women's Championship hadn't been seen since that year's Judgment Day PPV when Chyna had retained it against Lita and soon after left the WWF. I guess the WWF decided to build up their divas again so they resurrected the title and put the top 3 WWF females in the match against the top 3 Alliance females. It was announced that there'd be a mystery entrant in the match and no one was sure who it was. The mystery entrant turned out to be Jazz who made her WWF debut and charged the ring and manhandled Lita to begin the match. This was a stellar match that gave all the divas a chance to display their wrestling skills (that'd probably explain why divas like Stacy Keibler, Torrie Wilson, and Terri were left out of the match). The only major favorites in this match were Trish and Lita. The ending comes with Trish hitting a Stratusfaction on Ivory to win her first of 7 Women's Championships. I was personally hoping that the hometown hero, Lita came out the winner but Trish getting her push was well deserved as well

7.) Winner Take All Elimination Match: Team WWF (The Rock, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Kane, and The Big Show) vs The Alliance (Stone Cold Steve Austin, Booker T, RVD, Kurt Angle, and Shane McMahon)

- This was the match everyone was looking forward to and would play the deciding factor in which team stayed and which team left. Consisting of WWF's 5 top stars against The Alliance's 5 top stars, this was without a doubt one of the best Survivor Series main event matches in Survivor Series history. I'd put it in my top 10 if not my top 5! There was a funny part of the match where Shane would always jump in and break up a pinfall if someone from the Alliance was getting pinned. There were tons of close calls, tons of action, and tons of swerves. The first swerve came after Jericho had been eliminated, where he double crossed The Rock by attacking him, thus turning him heel. The second swerve came during the final moments of the match, with Austin and Rock as the last 2. Kurt Angle ran down to the ring and turned on Austin by whacking him in the head with the WWF Championship. Team WWF ends up winning after Rock pins Austin following Angle's attack and Team WWF celebrates, while The Alliance cries and Stephanie whines with her annoying, screechy voice. Vince comes out to the stage and celebrates to end the PPV. Awesome main event but it seemed a bit too obvious at times that Team WWF would win. Had the Alliance featured stars like NWO, Sting, and Goldberg then maybe the match would've seemed a bit more unpredictable.

Overall: This was a REALLY GREAT Survivor Series PPV. With the exception of 1 or 2 matches, this PPV was perfect in every way, shape, and form. There couldn't have been a better way to end the Invasion Era storyline than with this Survivor Series. The following night, Ric Flair made his return and revealed that when Shane and Stephanie bought ECW and WCW, they made him co-owner of WWF with Vince, unbeknownst to Vince. This would then begin the 50/50 Ownership storyline between Flair and Vince that would carry over into 2002. Many believe that the Invasion storyline would've been better had WCW superstars like Sting, Hulk Hogan, Golberg, Scott Steiner, NWO, etc been involved but due to contract issues, majority of them didn't step foot in WWF/WWE until the next year. But overall, the 2001 Survivor Series is a great one that must become a part of your collection",1385856000,,7334,5.136744966442953

7950003,4,B00005QAQJ,"This Survivor Series was o.k. I wouldn't say it was the best, but overall, it was good. What was so different about this ppv was that there were 2 companies on the line. The losing company of the main event would go out of business.

1)Christian v. Al Snow (WWF European Title): This match was o.k. Not really a ppv type of match.

2)Tajiri v. William Regal: I've never been a fan of these two guys. Overall, the match was descent.

3)Edge v. Test (Unification match for the I.C. and the U.S. titles): A good match. I liked it a lot. Test and Edge never really wrestled each other that much so it was a suprise to see how good they were in the ring together.

4)Hardy Boyz v. Dudleys: Steel Cage(Unification match for the WWF and WCW tag titles): The Hardys and Dudleys have faced each other before, but never in  a cage. It was strange to see them in a cage, but it worked. I liked this match a lot. With the high flying moves(from the top of the cage)this match was great. The MVP of this match has to be Jeff after that move from the cage.

5)Battle Royal (Winner can't be fired for a year no matter which business survived): It was just a bunch of guys gighting in the ring. Didn't really like it.

6)Lita v. Ivory v. Mighty Molly v. Jacqueline v. Trish v. Jazz (WWF Womens Title): I like this match. There hadn't been a womens title match in a while so it was good to see it again. The first suprise in this match was the debut of Jazz. She is a powerhouse! The last suprise was to see how good trish was in the ring. Her other matches before this were o.k., but this one was different.

7)Team WWF: The Rock, Big Show, Kane, Chris Jericho, Undertaker V. Team Alliance: Shane McMahon, Booker T, RVD, Kurt Angle, Stone Cold (The loser would go out of business): This was the match of the night. It had the biggest stars from both companies in it. This match went back and forth. The begining of the match was all Alliance. They took out most of team WWF. But with the Rock and Chris Jericho as the last of Team WWF, I thought that there was no chance. The match came down to The Rock(WWF) and Sone Cold(Alliance). After the great match these two had at WrestleMainia, I was glad to see them face each other again. Then Kurt Angle came back to the ring and I thought he was going to hit the Rock with the WWF Title, but I was wrong. It was a great and emotional match.

This was a great Survivor Series. Not all the matches were good, but there were some that I won't forget.",1226188800,,2478,4.2
