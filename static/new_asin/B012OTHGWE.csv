7357496,3,B012OTHGWE,"This movie was funny. After a while of watching one begins to like the characters,then the ending ruins everything!",1455580800,,115,5.105263157894737
7357497,4,B012OTHGWE,"""In the Courtyard"" (2014 release from France; 0riginal title ""Dans La Cour""; 97 min.) brings the story of Antoine. As the movie opens, we see Antoine, who is a singer in a rock band, refusing to go on stage due to lack of sleep or some such. By happenstance, Antoine literally stumbles onto a better gig: being the concierge of an old apartment building in the heard of Paris. Mathilde, played by Catherine Deneuve, and her husband are one of the tenants. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, I picked up this movie without knowing anything about it other than it stars Catherine Deneuve, and that's a good enough basis for me. I was right, Deneuve plays Mathilde, a seemingly super-active woman who as the movie unfolds lsuffers from more than just that. It is another brilliant performance from Deneuve, who scored her 12th (!) Cezar-nomination (France's equivalent of the Oscars) for Best Actress for this role (she did not win). We get to many of the building's other characters, each with their own quirks and problems. The movie almost has the feeling of being a filmed stage play, as pretty much all of the movie unfolds with the building and on its courtyard. Beware: this movie is labeled as a comedy-drama, but let's be clear: there isn't much comedy, let alone laugh-out-loud moments. Rather, this movie is a study of characters, and leaves a bittersweet aftertaste, slightly more bitter than sweet.

I recently picked up this movie at the foreign movie section of my local library. ""In the Courtyard"" certainly isn't bad, but lacks some tension and a better mix of scenery. That said, if you are a fan of foreign movies, I'd encourage you to check this out. Chances are that you will be watching in amazement, as I was, of Catherine Deneuve's performance.",1454198400,,1896,4.742424242424242
7357498,2,B012OTHGWE,"I like to watch French films to practice my French listening skills.  I watched the whole film, but I must say that this film was boring and depressing.  (not that many French films aren't).",1453507200,,190,4.5588235294117645
7357499,1,B012OTHGWE,"Enough with the deceptively presented foreign films. Please include info saying 'Subtitled' or 'Not in English' or something to make your clients feel like you aren't deliberately trying to dupe them..

7357500,5,B012OTHGWE,"As usual, Catherine Deneuve shines in this film.  Great characters and delightful story.  A must see for Deneuve fans.",1445472000,,118,5.157894736842105
7357501,3,B012OTHGWE,"I was excited when I saw that the Cohen Media Group was releasing TWO recent French films starring the legendary actress Catherine Deneuve. In September they released In The Name of My Daughter which I enjoyed and youll find my review on Amazon. That Bluray had the trailer for this film and it looked like it would be interesting. The quotes on the package say it is Hilarious (Village Voice and A Bittersweet Comedy-drama (The Hollywood Reporter). Though it will not be released until October, I was provided an advance screening copy for an objective review.

In my opinion, this 97 minute film is anything but hilarious. In fact I found not one funny moment. It is really a sad film about a woman who is having mental issues and a musician (who we never see play  and only know he plays an instrument because we see a guitar) who is depressed and needs to snort cocaine and drink caffeine to stay awake. As I watched it I expected something to really happen and for the story to have a resolution. At the 70 minute mark, I was still waiting but continued to the end. I really felt unfulfilled at the conclusion. What kept me watching was Deneuve (still beautiful and a powerful actress after her long career). The blub on the package tells me that the woman she is sleeping with is not her husband but the owner of an apartment complex (which has the courtyard in the title). I read that after watching the film and  honestly  there is no hint in the film that they aren't a husband and wife and both own the building.  There is a bit of slapstick in the film when a man asks the musician who takes the maintenance man position at the complex ( Gustave Kervern) to house his dog who tears up a scale model he has designed.

Its implied that Kerverns character is in love with Deneuve but I felt it was compassion more than love. And she needed him for compassion too.
So, I cant give this film more than three stars. (Id like to but I cant). Maybe others will like it more.

The other issue is that the English Subtitles are in white and often hard to read when the background is also white. It doesnt happen a lot but enough that it is frustrating. (see note below re: bonus feature)

There are two bonuses on the BD. First is the Theatrical Trailer. Next is an interview (actually more of a monologue) by the director . It runs 28 minutes and is in French. Here, however, the subtitles in white are larger and brighter and easy to read. (I wished that the subtitles in the film were as easy.

If you are a Deveuve fan (like me), Id recommend watching In The Name of the Daughter first. It is the better of her two 2014 films, not because of just her, but the whole production.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7357508,4,B012OTHGWE,"3 1/2 stars.  ***SPOILERS (but not the ending)***  The protagonist, a musician, loses his impetus for performing, and seeks a different lifestyle.  In so doing he makes a connection with a woman, Catherine Deneuve, his new employer, who's also at a crossroads in life.  I didn't read reviews or spoilers beforehand (recommended) so the story arc was intriguing, a surprise.  I found this quite absorbing, if not emotionally involving.  Of greatest interest were the interactions between Antoine and the tenants in the apartment building, each with his/her own story and needs/desires. Intellectually it engaged me and raised issues about many things- aging, change, periods of instability (and what they portend), lifestyle choices, and more.  I won't soon forget it even though typically I prefer warmer and fuzzier tales than this.  Recommended.",1477094400,4,847,5.412213740458015
