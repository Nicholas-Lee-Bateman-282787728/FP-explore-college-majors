8658728,4,B00KH57U38,"Yura Yamato thinks she has finally arrived at her dream school, but it turns out that it's nothing like she imagined.  In fact the girls of Stella Women's Academy much rather participate in war games then traditional school activities.  It's quite a funny series, especially when Yura starts to daydream.  Her daydreams are overly exaggerated, which will give you a good laugh.  There's not much action in this series, and relies more on the characters and humor to keep the story going.  The bottom line is if you like comedy animes, and girls with guns then you might like Stella Women's Academy.

This anime is subbed only, so there is no dub available.  Unfortunately, Section23 Films doesn't provide dubs, so if you're looking for a dubbed anime, this isn't for you.  I personally preferred subbed, so this isn't a problem for me.  I feel that sometimes dubs take some of the personality away from the series.

You can watch this anime on both Hulu and Crunchyroll.

The Blu-ray release of Stella Women's Academy High School Division Class C3 features 1080p video, lossless Japanese audio and English subtitles.
