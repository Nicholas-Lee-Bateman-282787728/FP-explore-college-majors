Ah, remember all those arrogant happy robots that could cry on cue as they graced(?) the screen throughout the 80's and 90's? Remember their hideously painted hair monster sidekicks? How could you forget, right? After watching this collection of rants and religous antics it's hard to imagine anyone sending a dime to a telecreep again. Sure the Swaggarts and Bakkers were bad but this prosperity preaching clown almost made them look sober. This should be required viewing for anyone keeping these jokers afloat with their hard earned grocery money. Sadly, it probably won't have an effect on the zombies that still tune in and keep them in business. They're probably too far gone.

Those who forget history...

Makes you wanna hop in the WABAC machine hotfoot it in to Bobert's church and yell """"Move to Guyana, establish Tiltontown... and don't forget to bring the Kool-Aid!""",1414713600,2,978,5.1
