The extras are very informative and continue an arc that runs through the series. If you loved The Next Generation, youll love this.",1529193600,,249,4.555555555555555
8655055,5,B00K12K8EU,In my opinion i find this movie to be the best out of all the original star trek move and give it 5 stars.  Video quality i give it 4.5 stars. Audio i give it 4 stars. Could of been five stars if it was in DTS.  Packaging and disk i give it only 2 stars. For the price i paid for it $9.99 i cant complain to much. But would have been happy to pay a little more to have a better quality packaging and disk.,1496966400,,405,3.6436781609195403

I have owned this title on VHS and DVD, so I may be a little biased as to the merits of the film itself. I can highly recommend this Blu-ray without reservation!",1422576000,,300,4.472727272727273
