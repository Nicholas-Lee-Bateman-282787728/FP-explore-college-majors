8340771,5,B001T88IB0,"Have been through all three of Jeff Cavins sessions now, and I have to say I
really liked this Journey through the Bible the best of all... Brought a lot of
things together for me from the Old to the New Testaments, as he says The
Story of Salvation...",1379980800,2,252,4.163265306122449
8340772,5,B001T88IB0,"I have had the pleasure of taking this study twice. Both times were amazing! The connections that Jeff Cavins makes between all of the characters and events in the Old and New Testaments are phenomenal. From beginning to end you really feel like you are a part of this story. You can enter into it and make it your own. I have read a number of scholarly treatments of Scripture, but this series is unique. It makes Scripture come alive. Scripture was brought into perspective, and it now has so much more meaning for me. This series is a great way for anyone to begin Bible study.",1343606400,5,580,4.429906542056075
8340773,5,B001T88IB0,"I saw this series of DVDs at our church (over 8 different weeks), and I really loved it. So I was curious to see if I could buy the set. I was surprised at how expensive these DVDs are. And I think I'm just going to borrow the DVDs from church! But the material here is wonderful. I was also surprised that no one had reviewed it yet, so I thought I'd share my opinion.

Jeff Cavins is a very good speaker. He's charming and even humorous at times, while delivering the message very well. He shows you how to quickly go through the entire Bible, concentrating on the important parts, and explaining how this is all a great story. Everyone loves a story, and the Bible tells a fantastic one! With great insight, he makes the connections between the Old Testament and the New. He shows how Jesus fulfills all the prophecies of the Old Testament, although he only touches on it from time to time - the topic of Jesus and the Old Testament is probably another series by itself.
I've been a Christian all my life, and I've read the Bible many times. But this DVD showed me how to process all that information, categorize the periods and put it all together.

Note: There's also a very nice colorful 'timeline' (in the form of a bookmark and a sheet of paper) and study material that's helpful to have along with the DVD. The'timeline' is a nice colorful way of remembering the different periods in the Bible - it also has the major books in the Bible for each timeline, the world power at the time, and little notes for each period. I'm not sure if this DVD set comes with those aids.

I still think the DVD series is expensive, but if you get a chance to watch this somewhere (like I did at our church), don't miss that chance!",1244419200,27,1723,4.328173374613003
