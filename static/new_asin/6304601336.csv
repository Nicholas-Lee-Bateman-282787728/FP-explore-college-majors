7874647,4,6304601336,"I tried forever to remember the name of this movie and finally tracked it down.  I had watched as a teen and couldn't wait to see again.  Predictable yes. Little cheesy, yes.  but it is a good 70 / 80's style fight movie.",1348185600,,221,4.093023255813954
7874648,5,6304601336,A five star movie! Not a low-budget piece. Lou does a superb job acting as well as everyone else and it's emotional at times. Lots of action you'll watch it more than once!,1334793600,,172,4.242424242424242
7874649,4,6304601336,"This is a really cool movie. Lots of action, a good story, and yes, even decent acting. I rented it because I have been watching ""The Incredible Hulk"". Lou Ferrigno and Reb Brown play two Vietnam vets. Lou saved Reb's life, and got shot in the head. The injury left him a simpleton, and Brown becomes his big brother/caretaker. Then some cage fight promoters get their hands on Lou, and Reb has to save him from the cage fights. It's really good, I'm telling you. Ignore the bad reviews on imdb. If you like action, cage is for you.",1228780800,5,532,4.383838383838384
7874650,3,6304601336,"If you're into illegal fights setup in cage matches, this might be wroth checking out.  But don't get your hopes up, Cage is not a horrible movie but is inconsistent in delivering what even a good B-movie should receive.

While the movie stars the large ""Lou Ferrigno"" (star of the Incredible Hulk series), the character he plays, Billy, is original, but a big let down for such an actor.  He doesn't even get as much screen time as his best buddy in the movie, Scott, played by Reb Brown . The movie opens up with scenes of the Vietnam War.  Billy is shot in the head, gives him brain damage, leaving him handicapped with the mind of a child for the rest of his life.  His handicap gets him mixed up into illegal cage fighting, where he only has 2 fights and both are a let down, with Billy shouting ""But I don't wanna hurt no one"".  I give props for the originality, but it is not very entertaining to watch.

The acting suffers in this film, and the goons are sillier than most B-movie goons.  The bad guys are ok, and Matthias Hues (Kickboxer 2, Mission of Justice) gets screen time as one of the fighters who gets a chance at Billy.  The music is just about as cheesy as the overall story and plot, and the beginning credits song/scene is enough to make one want to barf - cheesiest dang thing ever.

In a weird rounabout way the Cage is still an alright film, mainly for its attempts at originality and a plot that goes a bit more in depth than the usual B movie of its type.  The fights are ok, but really just don't look real at all, and there are no fancy martial arts movies at all in this one.  Check it out if you want, but getting hopes up for Cage will dissapoint you.",1168646400,,1682,4.221875
7874651,3,6304601336,"Lou Ferrigno plays a brain-damaged Vietnam Vet.  Two buddies are injured in Vietnam.  The bond becomes stronger when Billy (Lou Ferrigno) and Scott (Reb Brown)  are injured and share the same room in the hospital .  Upon release, Scott takes care of brain-damaged Billy.  When Scott's bar is a victim of arson and Billy has been kidnapped, Scott goes on a rampage to find Billy who the thugs have forced into boxing in The Cage.  There is a bar fight with Lou Ferrigno in green light.  That might help you recall that Mr. Ferrigno played ""The Hulk"" in The Incredible Hulk tv series (1978-1982) and final ""Incredible Hulk"" television movies in 1988, 1989 and 1990.",1057190400,,663,4.71304347826087
