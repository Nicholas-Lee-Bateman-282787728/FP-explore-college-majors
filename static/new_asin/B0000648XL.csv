7960619,2,B0000648XL,"I know some folks prefer subtitled movies over the dubbed varieties, but I don't like to work that hard for my mindless entertainment.

So, for this movie I watched the dubbed version and I felt it really took alot away from the action.

The voice-acting wasn't as emotional as what was depicted on the screen (in fact it seemed downright ""flat""), and at times they repeated the start of their lines when they spoke.

It seemed as if the people were reading the script for the very first time.

As for the characters, both Ultramen were cool. The monsters... not so much.

The acting was what I've come to expect from these types of films. I'm not looking for Oscar-winning material, so I wasn't surprised by the over-the-top gestures, and over-reactions to events played out on the screen.

The fight scenes were fun, though.

Being a fan of Godzilla, I couldn't pass up an opportunity to see somebody in a rubber spaceman suit beat the tar out of other rubber-suit monsters. Unfortunately this movie didn't live up to my expectations.

I'd recommend it if you have kids, as the violence is pretty tame, and the monsters aren't very threatening. Plus, the good guys win in the end. (oops! I gave it away)

Otherwise, it really isn't worth buying.

It's maybe a rental for 'kid's night'.",1134000000,,1287,4.68
7960620,3,B0000648XL,"I would have given it a 4-star rating if it were not for the ""cheesy"" part right before Ultraman Tiga makes the entrance. As a TV series, Ultraman Dyna shines with the GUTS members having a good sense of humor (and they are an attractive lot) unlike previous teams from previous Ultraman shows where they didn't really understand the concept of humor except for the funny bunch from the Ultraman Zearth movies (but then again, Ultraman Zearth is intended to be funny and outrageous). I also think that the Captain (Hibiki) is the coolest (and funniest) so far, but that side of his character is not fully explored or utilized in this storyline.
The production is above average (I still think the earlier Ultraman Tiga- The Final Odyssey movie had the best special effects and top-notch production) and it's great to see the team members from Ultraman Tiga interacting with Dyna's GUTS.  I am sure since Ultraman Tiga is showing on American television, viewers would get a better idea on the storyline regarding the relationship between these two teams.
A worthwhile watch if you are into this genre.",1062979200,10,1099,4.845744680851064
7960621,4,B0000648XL,"In a movie summer suffering from actors fighting digital effects, it was really fun to plug in an old school rubber monster movie.  Similar to it's Godzilla contemporary, Ultraman has been slicked out, shot on better quality stock, and some b-level computer generated effects have replaced the models I grew up with, but the core action still boils down to a guy dressed up as a robot fighting a giant rubber monster.  Which if you're down with that, you're in for a treat.
  As for the story, it's about this guy, Asuka, one of the people on earth who has been given the mantle of becoming Ultraman in the name of defending humanity.  Ultraman (Dyna) comes up against an alien foe bent on eliminating mankind so they can have the planet for themselves. Faced with an impossible challenge, and the doomsday clock ticking, Dyna has to discover the secret his predescessor, Ultraman Tiga, employed to defend mankind in its previous darkest hour. I was really surprised but by the end of this film I was moved.  Not moved like you are by the end of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", but I actually found aspects of the characters to invest myself in.  If you're in to this genre, this film is a great buy.",1024876800,20,1202,4.615023474178404
7960622,4,B0000648XL,Every child from the 60's remembers Ultraman which is the reason I purchased this DVD. Ultraman is still cool and the rubber monsters rule. Lots of fake buildings get destroy and the heroes save the day. What can be better?,1023840000,5,223,4.6
