173925,4,0975055119,"In reading some of the reviews, I can't help but think some are missing the point.  While I am only in my early 30s, the silver-hairs did not distract me from learning Tai Chi from this DVD.  While some of them don't move as smoothly as some can, Dr Lam does move quite well and provides an excellent example of the proper form.  As for the dialogue, after you listen to it a few times, you should be able to do the moves at your own pace and if you get ahead of the DVD, simply stand and meditate and wait for it to catch up.  I use the remote on my DVD player to rewind and fast forward so I can do things at my own pace.  If you are starting Tai Chi, this DVD should work for you.  If you are more experienced, then this may bore you quickly.  All I know is that I have slept better in the last week than I ever have (I do Tai Chi at night, right before bed).  I now awaken fully refreshed before the alarm goes off!",1110931200,176,919,3.877005347593583
173926,1,0975055119,"To begin with, this is NOT the Jayne Storey of ""Tai Chi Energy Training for Mind and Body"" (which is excellent). This OTHER ""Jane Story"" does the same old presentation of the Yang short form that everybody else does AND with the same weaknesses as a learning tool. I've been involved with the martial arts for over 20 years, buy a lot of these videos and see my students frustrated over and over again spending money on videos that simply run the movement from the front with a long winded description. This video is no exception - showing movements once from forward (or worse) angles, and the close ups of feet don't help. New students do NOT learn this way and will be frustrated by it... which is a shame because tai chi when properly presented is accessible to everyone. There's also a bug in the menu system that won't let you jump to more than the first 4 steps, which defeats the whole point of a 24 step DVD ! It does however get you to the various product plugs for other stuff - funny how they got that to work but not what you the buyer expect for your hard earned money. A big BIG disappointment and wasted purchase, so save your money. And consider the Jayne Storey who's videos WILL help you learn. Good luck!",1087516800,28,1224,4.37280701754386
173927,2,0975055119,"I bought this DVD to engage my 92 year old mother in some simple, introductory exercise. I have done Tai Chi in the past and thought she'd enjoy it. Paul Lam's style involves visual example and verbal description, and the older participants he uses were good for her to identify with. However, even on the first viewing the amount of dialogue made it difficult to deal with, left my mother & I standing and waiting impatiently for him to move on to the next pose. Since with DVD you can't fast-forward past the dialogue, it would have been better to demonstrate the moves without so much discussion before going on to putting the sequences together.",1078531200,42,649,4.6521739130434785
173928,1,0975055119,"I was so let down by this DVD that I almost gave up on Tai Chi. Why they chose a cast of people that were all over 50 is beyond me. I guess it's to appeal to that demographic. Paul Lam speaks too slowly and the group of seniors (to whom I mean no disrespect) move akwardly, out of sync, and barely stay 'true-to-form'. I would HIGHLY recommend that anyone who can stand up on their two feet at a moment's notice and walk up and down stairs without help should look into Kathy Smith's DVD. For those of you who are finding it hard to gain mobility - this is the DVD for you. I did not mean to offend so forgive me if I've been rude.",1075420800,26,631,3.9375
173929,5,0975055119,"Tai Chi for Beginners is an excellent program. Dr. Paul Lam teaches an innovative Step 1-2-3 method to make learning easy and enjoyable. I was able to learn the six beginner forms in one week. Tai Chi is not strenuous, but greatly assists the student to relax and release stress. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wishes to improve their health without destroying their joints. Dr. Lam's students in this DVD are all in their ""Silver Years."" However, this training would be enjoyed by all ages. The back ground music adds to the peace and calming effect of the exercise.",1073692800,155,577,4.666666666666667

I doubt that you can find a better way to start to learn this ancient Chinese system of spiritual and physical growth.  It is helping me to develop strength and balance.

173948,4,0975055119,"Tai Chi for Beginners is a great instructional DVD which points out the details needed to allow the user to fully grasp the correct movement taught. Many other instructional DVDs will have you do the move but not show you the exact way the move is to be done. Which leads you to develop terrible form.

The only draw back that I noticed is the section on Qigong. He shows you the movements but doesn't tell you when to do them or how it is to fit in the routine. I assume it is to be used as part of the warm up exercise.",1210982400,11,521,4.009615384615385

This is a great way to start the day, especially for people with arthritis.  Middle-aged and older people can benefit as well as younger  people.  These exercises helped with neck pain as well - a very peaceful, gentle way to exercise.",1173398400,10,397,4.695652173913044
173951,3,0975055119,"The way this video is broken up it is an instructional video, NOT a workout set video. You don't just learn as you run through a set and by the time you actually get to the set parts youve already forgotten how to do the stuff you did an hour ago. Its hard to get into and it turns you around as you try and do the moves so you cannot see the video. You go through each move in 4 or 5 different views each but still its hard to translate into movement. You stand on one foot waiting for him to stop talking about what you should be doing and showing a close up.

This video definately has value but if your looking for something to quickly dive into and follow for a workout this might not be the one. If you follow it long enough im sure you would learn enough to make up your own work out. But sometimes you just wanna have something to learn and do right then so you can get moving.",1170806400,29,885,3.9441340782122905

This video provides a gradiated approach to Tai Chi exercises and a basic set of forms that can be understood and performed by anyone with ambulatory capability, i.e., if you can stand up, sit down, and walk around without assistance you have all that it takes to get started here.

173957,4,0975055119,"I go to the gym regularly and I consider myself very atheletic.  Tai Chi is so different.  I borrowed the DVD from the library and I had to renew it several times to get familiar with the movements.  I know the movements well by now and I am enjoy Tai Chi.

Some reviewers comment that there is too much dialogue and it is too slow.  I found I had to pause and play some of the movements in slow motion to get all the intricacies of the movements.  I do wish there were more indexing so I could skip forward or backward much faster than trying to fast forward or backward to the right spot.

It may be more attractive to have a bunch of young female models to do the demonstrations but Tai Chi is for all ages.  For those who prefer Kathy Smith to Tai Chi, the two are not mutually exclusive.

The demonstrations are detailed - the reason for the dialog.  Repetitions allow practice along with the DVD. The angles and repetitions help to study the movements.  As I feel satisfied with my movements I learn another.  I look forward to doing the T'ai Chi exercises and am enjoying learning the position.  All and all it is very enjoyable and I am looking forward to gaining the confidence to move on into the 24 Forms.
