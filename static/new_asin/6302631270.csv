7828454,5,6302631270,"Very educational DVD for ALL AGES instead of ages 2-7. Since there are 6 videos of Kangaroo from Viewmaster company, some of them should be for all ages.like fun with baby animals, going places and Captain's favorite stories and animal alphabet (some of animal word in animal Alphabet are new to even for
older viewers) It's a very entertaining video and I just love the Captain in that video.",1455667200,,393,4.7101449275362315
7828455,2,6302631270,"This is not like a regular show with the ping pong balls falling on the Captain, or much interaction with the puppets.  My two year old really doesn't follow this one like he does the other shows.",1302307200,,196,4.297297297297297
