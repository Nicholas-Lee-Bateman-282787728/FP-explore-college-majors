8271876,5,B00194OPFM,Had a good experience with this seller . He was nice and personal @ the beginning . I felt like I knew him all my life . He has the education and work experience to make you feel safe in working with raw meat . The repitition of putting cure in and handling caseing in the correct manner shows his professionalism as a butcher and teacher . The way he answered the simplest questions and handled him self in General would make me buy any of his videos . Great job bill !!!!,1393804800,,473,4.096774193548387
8271877,5,B00194OPFM,I have never made sausage before until today and it was some of the best I have ever had. The video is like watching uncle Mike and Jim in the kitchen but who cares it was so helpful. At the end of the video you get all of the receipes so it is almost a no fail. We made the Itialian's and we cooked some up with the left over from the stuffer and wow it was by far a home run. Then we made the Polish Sausage with 50/50 venison and beef. I have never had a good venison brat from a comercial place but ours was awesome. We cooked one up and it blew us a way. Great video guys!!!! Hope this helps...since I learned so much and this video took out all errors for us before we began.,1259107200,3,681,3.8368794326241136
