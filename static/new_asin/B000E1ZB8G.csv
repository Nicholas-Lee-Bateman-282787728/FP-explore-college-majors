The next 2 episodes move Goh and Anna's relationship storyline very well with a few surprises along the way. My guess is that the Goh/Anna/Mira love triangle is finally settled and their focus will only be on destroying the Mimetic Beasts. The last episode is shown from the mechanics point of view and although I hate filler episodes, I thought it was worthwile, since they have been such a big part of the Dannar operation. It didn't really move the story too much but it was great to see what they do when Goh and the other pilots are out saving the world. Since the first episode was a recap (even though it was a good one) and the last episode was filler (even though I liked the concept) I gave this volume 4 out of 5 stars. Volume 4 was still awesome but not quite the caliber of the previous ones.

8246953,5,B000E1ZB8G,"Well season two finally got here. Some how I knew they would do a whole episode with just recapping of what happend so far. I say it is good to just see it once. I finally got to see Koji again, but it was brief. I want to see him fight again, I liked him, please don't tease me anymore and just put him in the battle with everyone else. There was some nice action with Goh and Mira  and also Goh and Anna, with new moves to watch.  Anna's got her new robot too and it is crazy strong. Whew, Im tired just watching that.  The intro isn't as hyped like Season One, I'm a little disappointed. It's just a bunch of clips from Season One.  I hope they change that.  The last episode of this disc is all about the mechanics, that was nice of them to do that, but is the first episode with no fighting in it, shocking to me, hehehehe.  All in all an expected intro to Season Two.",1144368000,2,873,3.9885057471264367
8246954,5,B000E1ZB8G,"The Godannar Season Two preview may have hyped the show up just a bit too much. I was left slightly disappointed, though Godannar is still the best TV show I've ever seen.

There are 4 episodes on this DVD but the first episode is a rehash summary episode with little new content, and the last episode is a miscellaneous episode featuring the mechanic crews. It was also the only episode of Godannar so far to have absolutely no fighting in it, which was a total shocker. Only the middle two episodes are important, you can skip the others and not miss out on much.

The new intro was somewhat disappointing as well, it was just rehashed images from Season One shows. Also AD Vision made it worse because they didn't dub over the English credits in good quality so the whole Season Two intro is blurry (the credits-free extras version looks normal though). Certain things I found confusing, such as the dream sequence featuring the new (and imaginary) G-Zero Gunner at the beginning of the second episode. I was looking forward to the return of Koji but I guess it will either never happen or happen later. Maybe the ""real"" Season Two intro simply hasn't been shown yet and we will get to see it in later episodes, one can only hope.

I think the two new episodes of significance could have been structured better. I was looking forward to fresh new things but for the most part things just carry on from Season One. Anna never even returned home, she's still a runaway.

There are still lots of good things to look forward to in this DVD. The way the Season Two logo appears is pretty cool, Shinobucchi seems better, and Anna gets a new robot (it's already on the DVD cover, though most people probably didn't notice). 9 episodes to go, I hope Godannar ends well.",1142899200,2,1764,4.537735849056604
