2711220,2,B000LP5FS6,"With a bid T-Rex on the cover you would think this is a movie about a rampaging dinosaur.  It is not.  The film revolves around a pharmaceutical firm that has created a new drug known as the Eden Formula.  It has the possibility of wiping out many diseases and even holding off aging.  As a big PR stunt, the formula was used to create a tyrannosaurus.  But a disgruntled past partner wants to get his hands on the formula.  With a bunch of mercenaries he takes control of the facility so that he can get his hands on the data and samples.  When unlocking the safes, they also unlock the dinosaur cage and it gets out.

A late meeting has a couple of executives still on site.  When they realize what is happening, they take steps to prevent the theft of their discovery.  Meanwhile the dinosaur gets a handful of cameos as it stumbles upon the odd person out in the city.  But the real dram is inside with the mercenaries and executives trying to outsmart one another.  Eventually both groups run into the dinosaur briefly and the film reaches some form of conclusion.

The characters seem to have been added in at the last minute.  The main attacker seems like a grunt and not a scientist.  One of the executives spends most of her time reacting like a little girl.  Its like they put characters in place and then later wrote their back stories.  Badly.  The dinosaur goes between looking like decent CGI to a bad puppet and keeps looking different.  Its scenes are almost comic relief.  All in all this doesn't even qualify as a good late-night film.  If you want to see how a very good creature film can be made on a small budget, check out Night Feeders and avoid this one.",1183248000,8,1678,4.4183006535947715

8162611,1,B000LP5FS6,"I think they spent most of their special effects budget on the dvd cover, because the 'dinosaur' in the movie sure didn't look like that. I draw the line at hand puppets. And I know Dee Wallace can act, but she didn't seem to put any effort into this one. If she saw the 'dinosaur', I could understand why.",1432512000,,306,4.203389830508475

8162613,1,B000LP5FS6,"This movie was dubbed Carnosaur 5 and was also known as Tyrannosaurus Wrecks.  Somehow it ended up being called The Eden Formula instead.  It features two and a half actors of note (Dee Wallace-Stone, Jeff Fahey, and Tony Todd).  Of the three only Dee Wallace-Stone does the job she was supposed to.  Jeff Fahey gets by doing as little as possible while Tony Todd goes on a rampage of affectations and weird gestures.  Even the puppet dinosaur gave a better performance than Tony Todd didn't try to.

The story is extremely limited; some bad guys break into the Calgorin complex to steal the Eden Formula.  They kill a lot of people in the process and plan to blow up the building afterwards to cover their tracks.  Not knowing there's a dinosaur on the premises, they accidently set the hungry monster free.

There's very little that can be said on behalf of the filmmakers, I don't know what they thought they were filming.  There's an unnecessary car crash done just so they can use some pyrotechnics.  There's also a film within a film as a kung fu scene is inserted for no good reason.  It's impossible to justify the waste of film on this mess.  I could have done a better job with a box of crayons, some butcher paper, and two sock puppets.  I'm ashamed to admit that I've watched it twice, years apart, because I forgot to put it in the discard pile.  That'll never happen again!  I can't afford to lose any more brain cells watching this dreck.",1409184000,,1453,4.530769230769231
8162614,1,B000LP5FS6,"There are many movies like this one. Very low budget and stupid characters. This movie was so fake. The dinosaur was like a card board cut out or something you could draw on a piece of paper. The characters were stupidly killed. Some of them stood there thinking a pistol would kill a T-Rex, then they got eaten. Horrible piece of crap!",1369526400,,336,4.435483870967742
8162615,2,B000LP5FS6,"If you've seen the first three Carnosaur movies, you've seen this one. They take footage from the first three and add a little bit. The first three movies were cheesy fun, this one was just...no.",1316044800,,195,4.6
8162616,1,B000LP5FS6,"Now I am the one that likes the cheesy movies but this was one of the worst movies ever.  It looks like the ""Carnivore movies"" were copied and pasted all over this film scenes and scenarios accept for the people.  This movie was too good for Jeff Fahey and Tony Todd they usually do much better movies than this one.. Don't waste the money......",1277164800,,345,4.375
8162617,1,B000LP5FS6,"Someone in Hollywood must be REALLY desperate to make some money and fast. This film is so silly itis beyond description.

For starters, Americans do not know how to do a dinosaur movie. Leave that to the Japanese.

For a big star, Jeff Fahrey must have been desperate to lower his standards to have been persuaded to film in such stupidity.

A complete waste of time all way around.",1255996800,,383,4.521739130434782
