8579549,4,B00CAZOGX0,"This is an interesting DVD in that it is American Justice programs that aired on A & E. The Manson segment, as well as the Ramirez segment, were the more riveting of the programs contained. If you like crime documentaries, this is a nice set of 6 programs that cover the Alcatraz Prison Rebellion, Charles Manson, SLA-Kidnapping of Patty Hearst, Reverend Jim Jones, City Hall Killings (Dan White) and the Night Stalker.",1374105600,3,419,4.833333333333333
