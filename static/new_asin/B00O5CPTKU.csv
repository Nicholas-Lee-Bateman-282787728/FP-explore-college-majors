8682231,5,B00O5CPTKU,"Grimm is one of my favorite shows.  The characters on this show are great and the makeup artists are fantastic.  The three pack was an economical way to buy the first three seasons.  I did buy this used; and occasionally the disks skip; which I'm not pleased about (this could have been included in the description).  Perhaps this is what we have to be prepared for when we buy a used product; but, I would prefer that sellers not sell defective products.  My excellent rating is for the content of the show; not for the quality of the disks - which I would rate lower.  So as a buyer of used products, I'm now a little wiser.",1447459200,,626,4.3076923076923075
