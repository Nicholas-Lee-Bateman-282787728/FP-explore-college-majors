7420591,5,B014R6Q05G,"About Shimmer and Shine:

Twin sisters Shimmer and Shine are Leah's secret genies-in-training! Leah always has some dilemma that she needs her magical friends' help with, and the genies are happy to grant her three wishes a day. As genies-in-training, they sometimes misinterpret what Leah wishes for, and often times they'll accidentally grant her wishes she didn't even mean to make. Each wrong wish quickly compounds into a crazy adventure. Ultimately, through teamwork, the genies and Leah find a way to fix the problem without the use of wishes.
Shimmer and Shine airs on Nickelodeon, weekdays at 11:30am ET/PT.
Shimmer and Shine includes the following episodes:

Genie Treehouse - Leah and Zac try building a treehouse but find themselves in over their heads. Leah asks her genies for a treehouse and is thrown for a loop when Shimmer and Shine turn her house into a house of trees.

Ahoy, Genies! - When Leah's bucket full of beach treasures floats into the vast ocean, Leah summons Shimmer and Shine to help her retrieve the loot. With the genies' assistance, a typical day at the beach quickly escalates into a magical beach treasure hunt, complete with a treasure map, pirate ship, and a talking parrot.

The Sweetest Thing - When Leah wishes for help making cupcakes for her school bake sale, she and the genies find themselves stuck with a giant birthday cake, some farm animals and a river of cupcake batter. How in the world will Leah finish her cupcakes without any wishes left, or worse, explain all this craziness to her curious (and hungry) neighbor Zac?

Lights! Camera! Genies! - When it looks like Movie Night will be a no-go, Leah asks Shimmer and Shine for some movie magic help. But when they accidentally wish the movie to life, they turn Leah into a medieval princess with a flying dragon to tame in her own backyard.

What a Pig Mess - When Leah's party food accidentally gets run over by Zac in his battery-operated car, Leah needs to figure out what else to bring fast. Leah asks her genies for more Pigs in a Blanket, but the genies give her real pigs wrapped in a blanket. It's up to Leah and the girls to catch the fast little pigs and find a way to fix this hog-sized mistake.

Abraca-Genie - Leah notices Zac the Magician's magic tricks aren't going quite so well, so she calls on her genies for some real magic assistance. But Shimmer and Shine aren't getting the tricks right either and suddenly more than a rabbit pops out of Zac's hat - a whole zoo of animals. The girls have to find a way to fix the magical mess before Zac's big performance.

Dino Mite! - After searching endlessly for Zac's missing dinosaur toy, Leah asks her genies to wish up a replacement and gets stuck with a real live Apatosaurus. Now Leah, Shimmer and Shine have to figure out a way to fix this behemoth mistake before Zac finds out - and it all starts with a little bit of dino training.

This DVD features over two hours of the silly Shimmer and Shine sisters in a total of seven episodes.. I love that it is a DVD collection of the episodes because we always miss this on television. The show is so adorable and wholesome. My 4 year old daughter loves the show and even my boys who are 7 and 9 will sneak peeks and watch it! The show is colorful and fun, plus it features some great lessons such as teamwork, patience, friendship and problem solving.

7420628,5,B014R6Q05G,"My 2 1/2 year old loves Shimmer and Shine! It is one of her favorite shows to watch on TV. Sometimes she will insist that she wants to watch it, but it is not playing on Nickelodeon at the moment. That is hard to explain to a 2 year old. I decided to buy this DVD for her so that if she is one of her moods when nothing else will do, I can pop it in for her. Her eyes lit up, and she was so excited when it came in the mail. She carried around the case with her all day! Needless to say we all pretty much had all the episodes memorized after watching them over and over and over for the first couple days. Lol. I even caught myself singing the song when I was doing housework one day! Haha! I do think it is a really cute show, and one of the best ones that is currently on TV. I love the fact that this DVD comes with 7 whole episodes on it...over 2 1/2 hours worth! We have a portable DVD player in the car that she can watch videos on if we are going on a longer trip. I love the fact that I don't have to stop, and restart or switch out the disk as often as some of the much shorter DVD's she has. This was definitely a great purchase, and I would recommend it to anyone who has a little Shimmer and Shine fan in their life!",1473379200,,1229,3.7859922178988326

7420660,5,B014R6Q05G,"This is by far one of the best shows that Nick Jr has come out with in a while. Shimmer and Shine are two little twin Genie sisters/friends who grant three wishes a day for their best friend, Leah. Leah is a cute little human girl. Their wishes tend not to go as they plan..... In fact, they tend to be a magical MESS! haha! But the three of them work together and fix their little messes so that everything tends to turn out ok!

It's really an adorable show, and I must say, it's one that I actually don't mind watching. Unlike dare I say, *cough cough* Caillou, You won't be annoyed by constant whining and baby talk. Shimmer and Shine is able to give little life lessons without being overly boring. It teaches your toddler social interactions like dealing with friends and sharing. Really silly little humor, but it's done really well.",1455667200,17,840,4.454545454545454
