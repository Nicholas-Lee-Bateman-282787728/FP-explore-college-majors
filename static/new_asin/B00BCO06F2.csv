8566282,2,B00BCO06F2,"My big issue with this tape is her poor instruction including her tutorial. Her instructions are limited to saying ""engage the pelvic floor muscles"" without adequate detailed instruction on what engaging the floor muscles actually specifically entails.  And the tutorial is so non-descript it's hardly helpful.  I have no idea if I am doing the exercises correctly or how I'm supposed to be moving my muscles during many of the exercises which  left me extremely frustrated, anxious and angry. I'm sure it's an excellent workout if I only knew how to do them properly! I gave up on the tape. In contrast, I moved to ""Hab it: Pelvic Floor"" dvd which is by a physical therapist. She has excellent detailed instruction, cuing and diagrams that make me completely understand what I am supposed to be doing and how to move my muscles. I am very happy with the Hab it instructor and am confident that I am doing the exercises correctly thus getting the workout that I paid for. I'm glad I made the switch!",1386633600,9,999,4.6971428571428575

8566284,3,B00BCO06F2,"There's no expensive equipment required for this routine, just a magic circle. Ms Monahan clearly demonstrates and explains the exercises, which are simple enough if you can lie flat on the floor without getting dizzy and can lift  your head and shoulders off the floor without neck pain. I can't. I'll have to do the thighmaster -- no lying down.",1373241600,3,347,4.783333333333333
8566285,5,B00BCO06F2,Excellent video...can be done by anyone regardless of weight and age.  I recommend this video for anyone that has a circle and wants to work and enhance the kegel muscles.,1363651200,6,171,4.7
