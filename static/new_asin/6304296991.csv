841484,5,6304296991,"Beautiful scenery, memorable songs, and a great cast headed by Deanna Durbin and Robert Page make this a wonderful movie to watch again and again.
Durbin plays the rich daughter of  a senator who runs away to good old California in search of her army boyfriend (David Bruce) who's really only interested in her money and prestige.
But along the way comes tall, ruggedly handsome Robert Page to the rescue!  It's a love-hate relationship between Page and Durbin at first, but in the end, love conquers all!!
This movie is a must own for anyone who loves fun, springtime musicals!!!  Gorgeous outfits too by the way.",1047340800,13,614,4.773584905660377
841485,5,6304296991,"I don't know where to turn to - must be the government of the US! Deanna Durbin movies are not being released on DVD, and this is a crime!
""Cant Help Singing"" should be considered a true American epic, being on the very level with, say, ""Seven Brides..."", but it's even better crafted regardless of being ten years its prior. The outdoor shots are amazingly fresh, the jokes are good, the copy is perfect. And of course there is Deanna Durbin, whom I have no need to praise, since she is always sheer quality itself, even though she is a bit on the plump side this time.
So, must be content with the VHS version until someone finally does something about it!",1009324800,7,658,4.401639344262295
841486,5,6304296991,"Deanna Durbin's only film she ever made in Technicolour. Beautiful outdoor setting pre Oklahoma,with fantastic songs sung by Miss Durbin as only she can do...Fantastic scenery including the Grand Canyon,and laughs all the way,with  Support from Robert Page and Akim Tameroff...Delightful! Delectable! with the score by Jerome Kern,A must for Durbin Fans.",973036800,8,354,5.8076923076923075
841487,5,6304296991,"This film is a highly enjoyable picture about a headstrong young woman in the nineteenth century, who runs away from home in the East and joins a wagon train heading West to find her army officer boyfriend. Instead she  falls for the cowboy who protects her on the trip ... The score is one of  Jerome Kern's best, beautifully arranged, sung and recorded; the number  ""More and More"" was nominated for the 1945 Oscar. Miss Durbin is  enchanting and the color print excellent with a clear, beautiful  soundtrack. Great quality video too. I looked round at the other viewers  and everyone was smiling. What more can I say?",939254400,12,620,4.694444444444445
841488,5,6304296991,"Despite Maltin's tepid review, this is a glorious feast for the eyes - ravishing outdoor cinematography in radiant Technicolor.  Kern's last original film score is short but a beaut - from the infectious title song  through CALIFORNIAY - an attempt to  do another ""Oklahoma!"",  there are love songs, book songs, comic songs.  Only half a dozen but well  written and gloriously sung by Ms. Durbin at her peak.  Her only color  film.  Oscar noms for Best Song and Best Original Score.",932688000,12,482,4.851851851851852

7867810,5,6304296991,We really enjoyed this movie.  The acting was good and Deanna Durbin singing was beautiful.  What a lovely voice she has.  I would recommend this movie for anyone.  I know that my grandaughters will love it.,1382227200,2,207,4.666666666666667

7867812,5,6304296991,"Deanna takes a trip to the west and takes along a large trunk that is taken off the train. She finds 2 men who she asks her to carry it for her. They start doing this but they take it in another direction more than once. The highlight of the movie is the title song done with the gifted voice of Deanna Durbin. At the end of the movie all of the many friends  of hers get together to sing and dance. This movie will make your heart sing, it is that good. I recommend this movie for musical fans, but also for those who enjoy a good movie. It is a musical comedy that is thrilling to watch.",1275004800,2,589,3.9495798319327733
7867813,4,6304296991,"Deanna Durbin's first and only movie in complete three-strip Technicolor was the 1945 box office smash CAN'T HELP SINGING.  Deanna dazzles as a headstrong young woman who follows her heart and hitches up her wagon to a cross-country settlement convoy.

Caroline Frost (Deanna Durbin) is the beautiful teenage daughter of an important East Coast senator.  She's in love with Cavalry officer Latham (David Bruce) and means to marry him, much to the annoyance of her family who have tried, quite unsuccessfully, to keep Caroline away from his company.  When Latham's regiment moves to California, Caroline hitches her wagon to the settlement convoy, but later loses her heart to a handsome cardshark (Robert Paige).

CAN'T HELP SINGING is a real treat for Deanna fans, firstly because it offers viewers their only chance to see her in full blazing colour; and secondly for it's beautiful score, one of the last for composer Jerome Kern (with lyrics provided by E.Y. Harburg).  CAN'T HELP SINGING earned an Academy Award nomination for the song ""More and More""; the rest of the tunestack includes ""Can't Help Singing"" and ""Any Moment Now"" (arguably the best song in the entire movie).

Mostly filmed outdoors and using no process shots, CAN'T HELP SINGING is in itself a remarkable early milestone of Technicolor photography.  The bold colours contrast dramatically with real blue skies and vivid locations, including the Grand Canyon.  Deanna Durbin is attractively costumed by Walter Plunkett (her final gown is a real showstopper).  The supporting cast includes Akim Tamiroff, Leonid Kinskey, Ray Collins, June Vincent and Clara Blandick.",1210982400,2,1637,5.2615384615384615
7867814,4,6304296991,"Can't Help Singing is the only color Deanna Durbin film so it is a curiosity in and of itself. The story is very much like the classic It Happened One Night only it is set during the California gold rush. It concerns a wealthy girl whose family disapproves of her engagement to a soldier. She runs away from home to meet up with him but on the way meets another poorer man who sweeps her off her feet. This version is not done as slickly as the 1934 original, but it is highly entertaining.

There are plenty of elements in this film that make it seem like a stage production. The large choral numbers are grand and static and the humor is similar to the screwball comedy style incorperated in early musicals. In fact, the humor helps to pull the dull parts out of the mud to regain the fluidity.

Durbin is very beautiful in color although she wears a lot of makeup and her hair is very blonde. She is slightly more mature than in her earlier comedy films but she fits the part well and carries the show.",1140739200,,1005,4.28421052631579
7867815,4,6304296991,"This one's a musical western with Deanna Durbin trailing her man out west via wagon train, her father (Ray Collins) in pursuit.  Not much plot: along the way she falls for another (Robert Paige).  But it's colorful (technicolor, in fact) and scenic with plenty of decent Jerome Kern music and some good comedy, primarily by a couple of foreign-type scoundrels (Akim Tamiroff and Leonid Kinskey) that reminded me of the Duke and Dauphin of Huckleberry Finn. The supporting cast includes Ray Collins, who went on to play Lt. Tragg on Perry Mason, June Vincent (That's The Spirit) and George Cleveland (Gramps on Lassie). Not outstanding, but if you love old musicals, you won't be disappointed.",1119571200,3,692,5.008695652173913
7867816,5,6304296991,"If ever a film was filled with sheer joy, this is it. Technicolor only seemed to add to a film's quality in musicals like this one. Can't Help Singing was Deanna Durbin's only film in color and the vibrant hues are stunning as both Durbin and the outdoors have never been photographed so beautifully. The brilliance of the colors is striking and the story is fun and wonderful, making this not only one of Durbin's best films, but one of the most entertaining American musicals ever made.

Deanna is a delight as the young Senator's daughter, Caroline Frost, hilariously scheming to marry young calvary officer Robert Latham (David Bruce) against her father's wishes in this adaption of  ""Girl of the Overland Trail"" by Samuel J. and Curtis B. Warshawsky. Jerome Kern wrote some great melodies for the film and E. Y. Harburg gave them lyrics still remembered decades later.

Deanna fakes a fever in hilarious fashion to get out of singing for the president so she can see Robert instead. But when that doesn't work and her dad (Ray Collins) wants to send her to see her uncle in New York, you can see the squirrel cage spinning in her head and the next thing you know she's gone missing, with a 5,000 dollar reward offered by her father for anyone who can find her. She's off to California, of course, as Robert has been sent with the 4th calvary to guard the Carstair holdings.

She gets fleeced along the way and ends up hitching her hopes on a wagon train heading out west. Akim Tamiroff and Leonid Kinskey are a hoot as the bumbling Russian thieves Gregory and Koppa, who spend the entire film attempting to steal Caroline's huge trunk but ending right back where they started! Circumstances pair her with card shark Johnny Lawlor (Robert Paige), who may need to find a new profession.

Of course they have a love-hate relationship which finally becomes just love. Before this one is over Caroline will have to pretend Gregory is her husband to get on the wagon train, then tell Johnny that she's going to California to marry the well known Carstairs (Thomas Gomez)! By the time they arrive in California, of course, all this catches up with Caroline and causes a lot of fun as she has to convince Johnny that he's really the one!

Her dad shows up and knows right away that Johnny's the right pick when he calls Caroline a liar. As her dad explains it, he's a Senator so she can't help it. She comes from a long line of liars! Gomez has a funny bit as Caroline gets him to play along and pretend he's broke up that she's not going to marry him. There is just one fun moment after another in this fine American musical set out west.

A rousing rendition of ""Californ-I-Ay"" and songs like ""Any Moment Now"" and the fabulous title tune, ""Can't Help Singing,"" are quite memorable. Deanna softly sings the Oscar nominated ""More and More"" to Johnny by a moonlit lake. This film makes you want more and more.

You'll find out what Cloud 17 is in this most delightful of films, and be glad you had a chance to see one of the greatest of stars in one of the finest American musicals. A real treat you simply can't miss if you love the movies.",1114992000,7,3137,4.51056338028169
