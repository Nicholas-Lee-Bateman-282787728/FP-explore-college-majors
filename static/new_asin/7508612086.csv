1114356,5,7508612086,The Gavin and Stacey Complete Series is a must for your video library.  When the series was over... we were actually upset!!  The characters are great and the story is always exciting and funny.  Nessa is one of the best tv characters that I have seen in a long time.  She makes the entire show worth watching!  Definitely buy this DVD!  Even if you have or have not seen a single episode of this series... you'll love it from start to finish!,1295827200,4,443,4.341463414634147
1114357,5,7508612086,"To be honest I've been a little late coming to `Gavin and Stacey', but a friend lent me this boxset and after watching one or two episodes I was completely captivated. This follows Gavin, who is from Essex and Stacey, who is from Wales and their friends and family as they start a new relationship and cope with travelling back and forth between the countries and the normal early relationship teething problems. The cast is simply superb and from the bro-mance between Gavin and his best mate Smithy to the hard bitten Nessa this will have you laughing out loud at too many times to count. My favourite has to be Gavin's mum, Pamela, who is slightly dippy, but cares deeply about her son and husband and comes out with some cracking lines. There are so many catchphrases in the series' that you will be repeating them to each other in short time and reliving the joy of the series long after you have finished watching them. The extras are pretty great, with hilarious outtakes, and featurettes about the making of the series and favourite moments etc. This is a genuinely funny series and manages to be sensitive and endearing at the same time. If you haven't seen it yet then snap this up and enjoy everything it has to offer and if you have already seen this on TV then this is an excellent package that includes the Xmas special, some extras and the complete three series' to relive again and again.

7899810,5,7508612086,"I love my dvd and i live in the States, a helpful hind for my American people buying movie's or show from another country, find out what region that dvd is playing because most dvd has region 0-1 and that's what we play here in the States, but in Europe the use region 2-5 and it's not compatible so you can't see it unless you buy one like i did on Amazon that you can watch every country in the world.",1497052800,,403,3.9876543209876543

7899812,1,7508612086,I can not play my Gavin & Stacy DVD's in my DVD player (which works great).  I am in the USA.  Are these DVD's made for Britain??  I am very disappointed.  Indeed.,1455235200,3,163,4.0

7899814,4,7508612086,Great series - DVD's were posted quickly & arrived well before expected date.  Only one small quibble - on some episodes of Series 2 there was a blue bar across the top pf the screen with a pictogram of a movie camera on it.  It was a little distracting to say the least - if the goods had come from Australia I would have asked for replacement for the affected DVD but don't want to have to send the faulty ones back and wait for new ones to arrive.  Otherwise am happy with my purchase.,1396310400,2,488,4.11578947368421
7899815,5,7508612086,Gavin & stacey is truly a beautiful show. It also has a place in my heart because my great great grandparents on my moms mother's side were from England & Wales. My great great grandfather was a Englishman from Liverpool and my great great grandmother was a welsh woman. They had my great grandmother in America but my great grandmother married my great grandfather and he was mostly welsh american. Then my grandfather on my mothers side had a grandfather on his mothers side that came from Wales. So u see im both of English and Welsh ancestry and can relate to the difference of the 2. This show is a must have for British comedy fans. Its funny and full of heart. Ruth jones character nessa is a very sexy woman.,1390435200,,716,4.431818181818182
7899816,5,7508612086,"Once I got this dvd I couldn't wait to watch it, after seeing some of the episodes on TV when visiting the UK, to visit family.  Gavin and Stacy are excellent as is all the other characters,you want to get to know them more and more, most of the part its very very funny, but an occasional scene could break your heart. Very well written, a really truly British comedy.",1375228800,,369,4.271428571428571
7899817,4,7508612086,Great blend of absurdity and pathos - the recipe for all truly good comedy.  Can't wait for the 2012 series!,1362614400,,108,4.4
7899818,5,7508612086,"Gavin n Stacey is great series with Cracking characters. I've already watched whole seasons 3 times, still amazing. If u wanna just relax and laugh out loud, this is ur must-have item! the quality of DVD is very good. The shipment was much faster than I expected. Awesome! Funny! Cracking!",1306281600,,289,4.8
7899819,3,7508612086,"The show was alright, it was cute and I did finish the series to see how Gavin and Stacey ended up.. but ehhhh, it's just a typical show, I wouldn't watch the series again, but I might glance at an episode when it's on tv.

Honestly, I didn't really think it was funny in any way. It had some little moments that would put a tiny smirk on my face for a second.... but that was it...

To clarify my opinion... I think ""Father Ted"" and ""Vicar of Dibley"" (comedy series) are funny and quite charming, and I also think ""Little Britain"" and ""The Catherine Tate show"" are hilarious and crude (stand up comedy shows)

Keeping that in mind, if you have taste similar to mine, you might not find this funny, and catch yourself dozing off at times.",1297555200,,738,4.294964028776978
