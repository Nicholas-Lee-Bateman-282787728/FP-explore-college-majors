3156116,5,B0016GOJV8,Not just because I am now an official SRK fan since watching all his films but the man is truly amazing and is so talented. He steals the film from all the other actors. The scene where he is playing the drum at her house where they are having a party and she does not suspect him has to be my favorite. I had a hard time hating him. I felt more sorry for him than anything else. I think he was just sick.,1387238400,2,405,3.8333333333333335
3156117,3,B0016GOJV8,Shahruck does OK but not one of his best opportunities. The story is not that great and the director was not good enough for the stature of the actors.,1385856000,,151,4.241379310344827

well done .",1380844800,,109,3.230769230769231
3156119,5,B0016GOJV8,This is a classic film of Shah Rukh Khan's. He played a negative roll in this film. His famous line: k-k-k-kiran comes from this film. This is an absolute must have for all Shah Rukh Khan fans.,1341964800,4,193,4.243243243243243
3156120,5,B0016GOJV8,"Amazing, just fantastic. A little bloody considering it's a bollywood, but completely in keeping with the story-line.  The songs and choreography are fun and catchy too, even in a story about a mentally-deranged stalker. Shah Rukh Khan is an amazing actor and it's obvious even in this early role. Definitely not for younger audiences.",1340928000,5,335,5.203703703703703
3156121,5,B0016GOJV8,"A class film! to be honest. 'Darr' is not just a romantic saga or a melodramatic flick, it is a complete entertainment from start to end and will glue your eyes completely to the screen. Shahrukh Khan, Juhi Chawla and Sunny Deol deliver brilliant performances and leave no effort to do justice to their respective roles. The plot is such that it keeps drawing you more and more into it. Everything from the characters to the romantic and sometimes haunting atmospheres will spellbind you. The film has strong characterizations and brilliant direction from Yash Chopra makes this film worth a watch ample of times. On every viewing of the film, you will always experience a thrill.",1328832000,2,680,4.870689655172414
3156122,4,B0016GOJV8,"Darr has the feeling already of being a bit outdated, even though it was filmed in the early 90's.  It's quite different from other Bollywood films we've watched, as there is a dark element to it.  Shah Rukh Khan, my teenaged daughters favorite actor, plays a stalker - a  man so obsessed with a woman that doesn't even know him - that he is willing to kill her fiance to have her.  He manages to hide his obsession from everyone, including the father  he lives with.

The music and dancing were great, but my daughter had us turn this one off, as she is such a fan of Shah Rukh Khan, she couldn't bear to see him in such a negative role!  Ah, teenagers, right?

If you don't mind watching older Bollywood, with a little bit of Hollywood obsession added to it, pick up Darr.  If you'd rather not see the usual hero carving the name Karin into his chest with a sharp knife, better pass on this one!",1319932800,2,897,4.260355029585799
3156123,4,B0016GOJV8,"This movie has the great Bollywood actor, Shah Rukh Khan (SRK) in a negative role. He is obsessed with a young woman (Juhi Chawla) and cannot shake it off even when she gets married. This obsession is smoldering inside and has not been manifested to anyone.

Anupam Kher plays an idiotic and comical cricket fanatic, who talk sanely only once, when he is the first one to suspect the diabolic SRK.

The movie has good, hauntingly composed songs, worth listening even today.

SRK should be commended to take on such a negative role and has put a lot of life into it. He makes your skin crawl; very effective, that! A top ranking star in Bollywood has to strategise carefully about his roles in order not to alienate his fan following.

There are a lot of events in the story, but the good prevails over the bad, like in all commercial Bollywood cinema.

The movie is a must see for SRK's extraordinary acting and the excellent songs.",1297209600,17,932,4.5568862275449105

The music is Wonderful, with a bit of a darkness to the songs, you'll fall in love with the music. Juhi Chawla does an excellent job, and Shah Rukh Khan's acting is Amazing, I truly believe nobody could have portrayed such an honest representation of a mentally-""off"", obsessed man. I fell in love with his character, and he's the bad guy! It's a complete plot, and there's still enough twists to keep you guessing and surprised. It's a film you won't forget.
