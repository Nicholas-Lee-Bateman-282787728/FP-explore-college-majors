8325825,5,B000VWQUDI,This is amazing and I love it.  This band may not be the best at each instrument but the way they work together creates waves that create happiness whenever they enter my head.,1363046400,,176,4.333333333333333
8325826,5,B000VWQUDI,I was very pleased with this DVD. It has some great interviews I have never seen before. There are a few where the quality isn't so hot but your told that up front and the rest of the DVD makes up for it I think. I am very glad I bought this and have watched it several times over.  Pick it up you won't be disappointed!,1302048000,,320,3.8484848484848486
8325827,5,B000VWQUDI,"Mainly featuring Joe Elliott and Rick Allen during the Hysteria era, the 10 Def Leppard interview segments on the ""Hysterical Pyromaniac"" DVD have a total length of 74 minutes (segment minute totals, in DVD order: 9+11+6+2+7+7+4+1+2+25). Only 15 minutes are from the Pyromania era, consisting of the 1st, 7th, and 9th segments. These 10 segments were originally recorded off of television, so the image and sound quality ranges from acceptable (which is 90% of the DVD) to barely intelligible, though if you're an old Lep fan who can remember videotaping stuff in the 80's, the few quality problems will not bother you very much, as they quickly become a reasonable trade-off for just being able to own and watch these rare interviews.

Rick Allen is featured in 4 of the 6 segments he appears in, which is 45 minutes of the DVD. Joe Elliott is featured in 8 of the 9 segments he appears in, which is 38 minutes of the DVD. Rick ""Sav"" Savage is featured in 5 of the 7 segments he appears in, which is 25 minutes of the DVD. Phil Collen is featured in 2 of the 5 segments he appears in, which is 16 minutes of the DVD. Steve Clark is featured in 0 of the 2 segments he appears in, meaning that he barely talks in them at all, being notoriously shy. But he does speak a little, and he smiles several times, too. Besides, Joe usually does the talking when any other members of the band are present, so Joe is featured whenever he has an appearance. He would dominate this DVD were it not for the final 25-minute segment, which Rick Allen has all to himself.

That final segment includes details of the car accident where Rick lost his left arm, Rick's first wife speaking to the camera and walking with him on the beach, Rick baring his shoulder-stub to the camera while dressing at home, and Rick using his left foot to help him cut a tomato while using a knife in his right hand. Also during this final segment, there is a 3-minute interlude from various years in the 1990's where each of the 4 guys in the band - Rick, Sav, Joe, and Phil - talk about him using only one arm and two feet to play his drum kit, with Steve notably absent due to his 1991 death from alcoholism. Incidentally, nearly all of the interviewers on this DVD who talk to Rick Allen only discuss his one-arm situation, and several explanations/demonstrations of his modified drum kit are included as well.",1261785600,3,2376,4.484988452655889
8325828,4,B000VWQUDI,I liked seeing the band in interviews I have never seen before. I feel I learned more about them. The quality on some interviews wasn't very good but that was explained in the beginning. Wish it was longer but overall satisfied.,1243814400,,228,4.585365853658536
8325829,4,B000VWQUDI,"Overall I was happy with this DVD.  It basically contains different interview clips from the band during the Pyromania/Hysteria days.  Die-hard fans out there may have some of the same footage on VHS tapes back from when MTV actually WAS music television.  The picture gets fuzzy in a few areas, but considering how old those interviews are, it's not so bad.
If you have a love for all things Leppard, this video is worth a look. Rock On!",1200441600,25,438,4.589743589743589
