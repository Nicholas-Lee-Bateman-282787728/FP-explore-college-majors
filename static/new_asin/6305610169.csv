7892405,1,6305610169,"OK, Hong Kong movies are not known for their subtlety and plot, but this jumped the shark. Characterisation was poor, even for a Hong Kong flick. Supposedly important characters would vanish for half of the film, only turning up to betray the lead character before getting shot. The plot was missing presumed dead and the developement was so garbled, I gave up. You can find decent Hong Kong flicks, but not here.",1077667200,,413,4.75
7892406,4,6305610169,Lead Actress Almen Wong turns Clarence Fords average girls and guns flick into a thoughtful drama. The romance part was a bit sappy but the movie was stylish and sexy. Almen has to go through a wide variety of emotions throughout the film and has the attitude and the right personality to become the master assassin Cat.,997401600,4,320,4.631578947368421
7892407,2,6305610169,"I'd have to say that if you want to see an extremely mediocre action movie, you might want to rent this, otherwise, leave it alone.  The blurb for the movie made it sound like a good action picture, and some of the action wasn't that bad, but the plot behind this movie is absurd.  Basically, the premise is that Cat, the female assassin, is out on one last kill, and it becomes botched when another assassin is after the same target, and she finds herself on the run for her life.
 Thrown into the works is a love affair, which is handled very heavy handedly, and never for a moment seems real.  A police officer is trying to find out who the female assassin is who is killing off crime lords, and he suspects Cat.  She, in turn, is following him around, visiting his apartment, following and videotaping him, and making friends with his daughter.  Call me pessimistic, but I couldn't get into any of the sappy romance this movie was trying to sling my way.  The actress who plays Cat is beautiful, but can't act her way out of a paper bag, and the male lead is no better.  This movie had some of the worst acting I've ever seen, by almost every character.
 I'd have to say to give this movie a miss, the action can't make up for the lack of a plot, and the ending of this movie in no way makes up for the ninety minutes of sheer boredom you'll experience by watching it.  There's many better action movies out there, I'd recommend you try something else, or rent something you've already seen and enjoyed, you'll get more out of it.",985824000,,1534,4.3321678321678325
