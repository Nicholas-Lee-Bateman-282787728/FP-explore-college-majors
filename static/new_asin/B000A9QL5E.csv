 I rented Sobrenatural (1981) directed by Eugenio Martin, under the title ""Return of the Poltergeist"" in VHS at some rare video store. It deals with a woman who is married to a tyrannical old geezer. She has a kind man whom she is seeing. Turns out the jealous old geezer has an accident of some sort and winds up on the bed in bandages. Eventually he dies but comes back to haunt his former wife. The dated look of the film and lack of lighting in some scenes render it 'creepy' at times if you watch it alone late at night but there is not enough sustained interest to make it truly worthwhile. There's scenes of Supernatural activity like things being tossed in the air, etc. It's one of those foreign films that were made to capitalize on popular American supernatural horror films, namely the far superior The Entity (1981).

I probably saw a cut up bootleg version so I don't know if scenes were deleted or added.

If anyone wants to buy a copy I know a place that sells it. Send me a message.",1389571200,,1041,4.3782383419689115

8076469,2,B000A9QL5E,"If you are buying this collection for It Happened At Nightmare Inn, The Movie lists a 120 minute runtime but when you play it, it runs 68 minutes and the cuts are obvious. So I do not recomend you buying it for that movie alone.",1154908800,12,228,4.088888888888889
