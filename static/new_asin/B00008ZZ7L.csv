1876169,5,B00008ZZ7L,"I saw these movies when they aired on network television.  I haven't seen them since, but have always remembered them favorably.  I found them on Amazon and decided to buy them.  I am not disappointed.  The only way they could be better is if they were in Blu-ray, but they weren't popular enough to go that route.  Brian Dennehy has always been one of my favorite actors and he does not disappoint.  He also produced these three movies.  Good storytelling.",1314921600,5,457,4.6375

1876172,5,B00008ZZ7L,"It's a contrast of action and suspense and very fine acting on Brian Dennehy part. I brought the video and couldn't wait for the dvd and I have several of his movies going back a long time, I don't like saying to much about movies as everybody see them in a different aspect and I don't want to spoil there ideas of what a to expect and let them judge for themselves.",1270857600,,367,4.111111111111111
7988378,5,B00008ZZ7L,"The politician running for Mayor should be a typical Politian and was portrayed rather well.  So then was the Sheriff Dept Lieutenant, Detective and Sergeant.  No sweeping things under the rug.  Amen to this type of program, portrayed after an actual event no less.  John Henry",1511049600,,277,4.956521739130435
