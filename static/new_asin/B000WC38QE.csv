Joyce Jillson plays Tara B. True, a free spirited stewardess with a lover in every ""port"". This is a reverse ""R"" rated 70's version of ""Boeing Boeing."" John Carradine plays a bit role as a retired ""B"" grade horror actor. That was a tough one for him. The puns and jokes are campy and stale by modern standards. While it was designed to be a comedy, don't be surprised if you groan more than laugh... ""even the autopilot made a pass at me."" The movie claims Jillson is a karate expect, but it actually looks more like judo. If you expect to see Jillson do a lot of fighting with Uma Thurman karate moves, don't blink.

There is abundant nudity including Candy Samples. The only reason why anyone would watch this film is because Joyce Jillson (1945-2004) of TV's ""Peyton Place"" and Broadway gets naked.

HUSTLER SQUAD:

The movie starts out with a failed raid by rebel Filipino forces against a Japanese stronghold. The Japanese plan of having their top brass all gather at a bordello on the island. Our military, lead by Major Stonewall (an unkempt John Ericson, Sam Bolt from TV series ""Honey West"") devises a plan to train and place four women in the midst of them. We meet the major in the middle of an improbable high stakes poker game where he bluffs his way through. He is chosen because he thinks outside the box. He meets with Paco Rodriguez (Ramon Revilla), the leader of the rebels as they openly discuss options while drinking in a public bar in Australia. After a bar fight where the guys get beaten up by a woman who knees them in a soft spot, Paco comes up with an idea of using women.

The first stop is a female prison. After the cat fight, Ericson selects imprisoned killer, Rose Carson (Nory Wright). She slit the throat of her boyfriend for sleeping with another woman, apparently illegal outside of Georgia.

The second woman is Anna Oleson, a doll face pacifist nurse with a fatal disease and has only 2 months to live (after the 60 day training course). Anna is played by Johanna Raunio, who two years earlier in 1974 was Miss Finland!

Sonya (Liza Lorena) is added as the third member. Her family was tortured, raped, and killed by the Japanese. She was raped also.

The fourth girl is Cindy Lee Dawson, a prostitute who has a price on her head for ""crossing the black market."" Played by Crystin Sinclaire she has the facial features of Traci Lords and a raspy voice.

Most of their training is accomplished in a long music montage. The girl's manage to infiltrate the bordello (as if anyone would think otherwise). No one questions how 3 English speaking ""round eyes"" 2 of which are blonde happen to be part of this group of Filipino comfort girls.

Cindy Lee Dawson and Nory Wright provide the movie's nude scenes, which are brief and nearly PG-13 by today's standards.",1344556800,3,2808,4.564612326043737
