1582931,4,B00005JPJK,"This film was billed as being based on the ""Conversations with God"" books but the reality is that this film is the life story of author Neale Donald Walsch from homelessness to best selling author. When the ""conversation with God"" does come, it's halfway through the movie and lasts all of about 10 minutes, and it's more of a lecture than a ""conversation."" Though making a film of those books would be nearly impossible, I had hopes that someone's creative genius would come up with a way to translate the ideas of the book series into relatable situations, little dramatic examples sprinkled throughout the film. I did not expect what came across as a vanity project on the part of Neale Donald Walsch to have his life story played out on screen.

Having said that, aside from the mistitle and claims, the film does do something rare that most films don't cover: homelessness. We rarely see homelessness in films and this film humanizes the very people we often pass on the street without a word or glance. This film also shows a lot of Oregon, with scenes in Portland and Ashland. And I absolutely adored the cute, quirky redhead young lady on the bus. There are some spiritual gems in this film, particularly the phrase one should always ask oneself: ""what would love do now?""

While I'm inclined to give this film 3 stars, I think it's great that more spiritual films are being made and want to encourage the development of that genre of films by supporting films like these, no matter how much they can be improved upon. I certainly wish that ""CWG"" would have been a much different movie or advertised more as a bio-pic than being an adaptation of the book series. The films ""Peaceful Warrior"" and ""The Celestine Prophecy"" were better done, but I still did walk away from the theater inspired by this film and it made me feel more compassionate towards homeless people, which Portland has a lot of, so it can't be all bad.",1166140800,134,1928,4.6345029239766085

1582980,5,B00005JPJK,I highly recommend you read Stephen Deutsch's Conversations With God. I found myself reduced to tears. Mr. Deutsch and I have had many similar trials and tribulations. It took a while until I could drown out the noise of this world and listen to the still small voice of a mighty G_d. In these questionable and very often times..may we ALL stand still and KNOW that He is Lord over and in all.,1479168000,,393,4.397260273972603

1583187,4,B00005JPJK,"We watched this movie after listening to the audio books, Book 1,2, & 3 + New Revelations. I give the movie 4 ****'s because I believe it is worth while AFTER reading/listening to the audio. To me - it seemed more of a PREQUEL to the books. With that being said... I must admit - if I had watched the movie FIRST, I may not have bothered to dive into the books. I love the books - I would rather read the books than go to my job for 8 hours a day. I found myself eating lunch in my vehicle - just so I could listen to 30 more minutes of the book. Mr. Neil Donald Walsch (author) writes wonderfully. This movie I don't believe portrayed as much of the 'conversations with God' as I would have liked, but gave a great image of how it all began.

If you have not read the book, it is WORTH the read! Come to the books with an open mind, they really make you think!",1412467200,,861,3.9482758620689653

The movie begins when the author is in a very desperate situation, and shows the path that leads him to write the 'Conversations with God' series, about 25 books.

This film will help the inmates to understand what caused him to write these books.",1408320000,,560,4.957446808510638

1583223,2,B00005JPJK,"Kind of churchy...  like one of those holy holy low budget but clean hallmark feel-good movies made mostly for an elderly church mouse audience....  I feel it lacked substance, or a more realistic feel...  it really just centers around the accident and homeless parts of Walch's life, but would have been more interesting and inspiring if it had followed the outline of the book 'friendship with God' more closely, giving a bigger picture, and showing how different elements in a lifetime add up, and how neale's background created the 'perfect storm' for some of his revelations.  They aren't churchy books for a narrow audience, so I wonder why the film seems so limited?  Why didn't you have them tell it like it really was, neale?  The people should have been more out of their minds and thinking outside the box.  This film had potential to shake things up just for a larger audience just as much as the books.  I was just introduced to the works of Neale Walsch a couple months ago, and have been submerged in the audio books and in my own relationship with God ever since.  The books are fascinating, and Walsch's life story is fascinating, but I just can't really say I recommend buying this movie.  Renting and watching once, maybe, to get a sort of visual outline of why we shouldn't judge homeless people, but it didn't do much else.  I'm going back to my audio books.

Considering the low budget on which this film was made (+/-$500,000 according to IMDb), it makes very keen use of visual effects, great cinematography with earthly tones, and it's very well cast. In my opinion, Henry Czerny (as Neale Donald Walsch) played one of his most memorable roles in this film, and it makes one want to see more well made, thoughtful, and positive comeback stories like this one.",1392854400,,719,4.798387096774194

Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)
This review is from: Conversations with God: An Uncommon Dialogue, Book 1 (Vol 3) (Hardcover)
I could say so much about this book, but until you actually take the time to read it for yourself; you will not understand!! I find this book in the library in New Orleans(in the occult section believe it or not!!). That was my first introduction to this book. I read it and wanted more, and more!! So, I read everthing I could get my hands on in that library in this series. Now, I found it on Amazon and purchased it for my son who I had spoke to about how this book changed my life and started me on the road to sanity as it answered so many questions that I had about so many things that go on in this earth realm. It made sense!!! It spoke to my soul and it actually said things that I already thought before reading it!! So, I have read and re-read this book and will continue to read it over and over. It is my spiritual guidance here in this earth realm. It has made me a better person and a deeper person which I like very much about myself. I do not starve for answers anymore to what goes on around me and others. I am not afraid. When I read it, it is like God is talking just to me and I am calmer and more enlighten each time I read it. I have notes all over the pages. I hope to purchase more of these for others that I love and I hope they will read it too but if they do not, I have done my part to enlighten them to help make their lives better from within! So, yes, I feel it is a must read for anyone seriously searching for the whys of what is going on in this planet we live in and desire peace within themselves!!",1371772800,2,1721,4.020408163265306

1583309,5,B00005JPJK,Conversations With God is a terrific movie. It helped me understand the heart of the author of one of the top selling books in the nation.,1356566400,,138,4.346153846153846
1583350,5,B00005JPJK,"First, I tend to have my father's Unitarian outlook on life and religion, so much of these books speak to me.  I have had an ongoing examination of religion and my place in the universe, something I believe every person must do, as almost a rite of passage.
  My mother's family was Presbyterian and I really never understood it.  It didn't seem that you had a chance to be saved.  Now I see that since it was a Christian church, the emphasis was supposed to be on Jesus, but I always wondered what happened to God during the ceremonies yet it always ended with ""Our Father...""
  I am also a writer and I definitely know the feeling Mr. Walsch had when his pen began to move by itself.  Inspiration is literally 'breath of God' and there are times when the words just come without thinking - a heady experience indeed.
  I have read the Conversations with God, getting several shocks reading them, but I continued with several of his other books.  Having more WHOA moments.
  And he takes a bit of all philosophies, something I approve of. There isn't just ONE holy book and most have equivalent teachings.
  What I have gotten out of these readings, besides the cynical thought that the author has certain changed his condition, that:
  1. GOD IS LOVE.  Period.  Infinite, all encompassing, without limits. He requires nothing from us.  He appreciates love in return but it makes no difference in the long run.
  2. We all go to God, whatever that entails.  Being a scientist, I know energy cannot be created nor destroyed but can be converted to matter.  Not that it matters.  There is so much energy in each soul, it has to continue.
  3.  He gave us FREE WILL.  We will behave as we think is 'right', a bit scary when you think of the dictators of this world. Is doing what is 'right' a wrong thing?
  4.  But don't believe everyone gets off free without some sort of judgment. That instant between life and death, the person does have their life flash before their eyes, but from the viewpoint of the people they influenced for good or evil. That sounds like a fair trade for Purgatory or Hell if you ask me.
  5. But then you are taken 'Home to God', a comforting thought.",1356393600,,2178,4.471938775510204

1583356,5,B00005JPJK,"Just finished watching this wonderful, beautiful and inspiring film. My cheeks are still wet from my tears. Why didn't I hear of this film before? Why was it not a box office smash? I have a huge collection of some of the greatest films ever made and this humble, little, relatively unknown film, now tops that list! I'll pray for those Christians who through the corruption of limited interpretation and manipulation for personal gain of both church and state, have failed their congregations to be able to recognize the higher revelations of God through such messengers as Mr. Walsch. He has clearly demonstrated both here, in his books and to the best of his ability in his life, that God's truth is available through everyone's heart. All I can say is that if you fail to be thankful for what is being shared through this humble messenger,a person much like any of us, with problems, frustrations, faults and inadequacy's, then you are failing to receive a most beautiful and precious gift by God, Himself. Look with humility into your heart and ask God to reveal His Truth to you and set aside all previous concepts about who or what you 'think' God is. As Neale said in his summary of what God wishes to say, "" You've got Me all wrong"". It is time for us all to be truly open to what God's Reality is rather than what we currently believe or conceive it to be. Don't put before your neighbors those tired, old concepts whose foundations are as houses built upon the shifting sands of time. I want to know only what God is, not what you conceive God to be. It will always be through the humble that God reveals Himself. And yes, God is both Mother and Father in ONE. And yes, God lives at the center of all living beings, creatures and things. And yes, God is the infinite ocean of unconditional love. And yes, we are all here to merge our 'drop' into that Ocean by expanding OUR ability to love unconditionally. If you doubt any of these things then you aren't listening to the voice of God in your own heart very well. I can't make it any clearer than that, the rest is up to you...just listen. Much peace and love to everyone. Paul",1332633600,9,2139,4.459183673469388

The acting is hard and emotions are real. When you watch the daily struggles of this man you feel his pain. For me the message here was once again a confirmation that you cannot experience the highest emotions without going through difficulties. And one day when you let go of all the thing that you mind does to you, the games it plays, the repeating patters of negative thoughts, you become open to a message from the Source. For some most of us its God, for some it may be from the Universe. There is a small part of God within each of us called the soul or the spirit.

God is holy and pure and beyond our being able to understand that concept because of the sinful state of this world we live in.

IMO the basis of the film is that we human beings have created G-d in our image and it's time that we updated our image of G-d from an angry, jealous, capricious, vengeful deity to a more benign, loving, humorous, forgiving deity--basically a helpful friend rather than a paranoid dictator. According to Walsch:

""It's time for a new paradigm, a new understanding; a larger view, a grander idea.""

""The New Spirituality is a global movement to create the space for humanity to experience its natural impulse toward the divine in a way which makes no one else wrong for the way in which they are doing it.""

However, for people mired in a particular way of thinking they seem shocking and revolutionary...That was exactly the point.

I should have listen to my inner self when I watched the movie: again, typically for a US movie, the story is a happy ending success story finishing with the author getting rich. Of course there is nothing wrong about money (St. Agustine, 4th century AD, had the same opinion). But Mr Walsches' words are against the Christian moral and teaching. It's true that ""we will recognize them by their fruits"" as Jesus told us and Mr Walsche's fruits are a dangerous parody of the Christian message leading to the disgregation of family bonds and excessive interests for our ego.

About his mistakes in life and his stuggle to survive ""out there"" and how he makes his way to a whole new life.  He almost gives up, he whright an angry letter to God.  What he did not expected but did happend, was that God answered him.
And the conversations begins.  A lot of questions is been answered. Neal Donald Walsh is an extraordinary man.

For anyone who has ever survived hard knocks in life, or asked the universe ""Why ME, God?"" this story is especially for you. This is a film that should not be missed.",1189468800,2,359,4.358208955223881
1583596,3,B00005JPJK,"Interesting movie with lots of heart and a very unique and compassionate look into the lives of homeless people.  The movie is a drama and quite slow-paced, but did not bore me.  The acting is decent and the story compelling enough to keep intrigued viewers from dosing off.

I agree with the previous reviewer who said that this movie is more of a story about Neale Donald Walsch's transformation from poverty and homelessness to best-selling author than it has anything to do with a conversation with God; however, the entire movie builds up to the ""encounter"" with God so the story is effective to the plot.

While most people who are familiar with Neale Donald Walsch's writings will relate to the content, Christians who are considering viewing or purchasing this movie (because of its title) should note that this is not presented as a ""Christian movie"" nor does it contain a Christian sub-theme.  The ""God"" in this story is a ""new age"" concept, which basically has nothing to do with God in actuality at all, let alone a biblical view of God.  To put it in basic terms for folks that have no knowledge of New Age philosophy, Neale Donald Walsch's god is, in a certain respect, ""his consciousness"" (his ""inner voice""), not really an external deity.  Walsch's teachings include a mix of monism (all is one and one is all), pantheism (all is God and God is all), and is heavily slighted by experience and emotions rather than words (doctrines).  Walsch was once asked, ""Are we all gods? Or all part of God? Or are we all collectively God?"" to which he answered, ""Yes, to all of the above!"" (just to give you a sense of his logic)  Walsch sometimes quotes Scripture (where it serves his opinion) but ignores context.  His beliefs include an ideology that there really is no right or wrong, no sin, no Divine Father to son/daughter relationship and everyone is basically good (even Hitler will be in ""heaven"" according to Walsch).

Fortunately, these expansive views of New Age spirituality are not focused on in this movie so, if a person can set the detail that Walsch is ""new age"" aside, they will likely be able to find some positive insights from the film.  At the very least there is a quality emotional element to the movie and, as a previous reviewer noted, one of the rare few films that focuses on the homeless and with such a positive, compassionate perspective.

Personally, I'm not a fan of ""guruism"" and that's exactly what Walsch has made himself (IMHO).  My personal conviction is that a person who has been truly impacted by God does not rush out to sell that experience for a profit.  Walsch, like virtually all new age authors, have made themselves fortunes off their generic value, Hodge podge smorgasbord of feel-good theology (much like many televangelists as well).  In observing Walsch's personal beliefs, there are moments when he touches truth and says things eloquently enough, but again, his more elaborate reasonings on faith (most of which do not align with anything one might consider biblical Christianity) are not effectively covered in this film.

Decent film, emotionally satisfying, but certainly not Oscar worthy and Christians will not identify with the content.",1189123200,9,3202,4.845871559633028

1583598,5,B00005JPJK,"This movie was very well done, and Henry Czerny is remarkable in it.  There is one scene in particular, where Neale is at his lowest and just desperate, which moved me to tears. When you watch the movie, you'll know just which scene I'm referring to.  Czerny is superb throughout this film, and in this poignant scene especially.

As I watched this DVD, my husband came in to the room to sit with me during the last 20 minutes of the film.  He watched quietly, then asked me ""WHAT movie is this?""  I told him, and although I read the Conversations With God books years ago, my husband does not share the same areas of interest that I do, so he had never heard of them.  I explained the background of books and the author to him.

He wanted to see the entire movie, (which was surprising to me since this movie doesn't have a single explosion or car chase in it) so the next night I watched it again, this time with him.  When it was over, he asked me if I still have the books.  ""Of course!""  (I'll have those books forever).  He asked me if I would find them so he can read them.

Now, this is a man who was raised Catholic and has felt disconnected from the church for quite some time.  Not from God, but from church.  There is a difference.  I can't help but wonder if this movie will bring an entire group of people to re-discover these books.",1188172800,22,1347,4.20703125

1583669,3,B00005JPJK,"i'm a sucker for any book or movie that sounds spiritual. the title had the movie in my hand at blockbuster, despite my not knowing a thing about it, except the title. so what if i get a lot of stinkers choosing movies this way? the few good ones repay my interest many times over. however this book is neither a winner nor really a loser, i'd rate it a B-. nice uplifting story, realistic (i loved the guy protecting his area, we had the same problem canning on a beach, where the regulars had divided it all us and kept out all causal competition), dumpster diving (we've seen people living in dumpsters, scubbing them down and recycling everything thrown in them), cheap camping (i sure wish there was more of it, thanks to salinas' rodeogrounds parking lot and the catholic workers house Mary's Place there). We certainly identify with the author, having lived for nearly a decade on the streets in a converted bookmobile with kids. But identifying with a movie's characters is only the first step in a good movie, not the be all to end all.

the movie is a biography, a rags to riches story with a new age spiritualist twist. He talks to God, actually it is closer to a lecture, but the idea is there. the result of this `dialogue' is at least 1, as i read online about it, i find out-3 books and lots of spinoffs out there. First, if it was a good movie, i would have bought the book immediately, i've done that before, see my review on Whale Rider for one example. I didn't, nor will it, the movie doesn't see me on the necessity of me reading the book, now, without delay. that makes the movie ""unsuccessful"" as far as i am concerned. Second, if it was a good movie to me, the ideas would resonance as being true or at least interesting (interesting means buy book, now), they not only do not sound true, they don't sound even close. This is the big point, the movie is about a very specific way of looking at life, my life and your life, God and the world. If you don't like the basic orientation then the movie is not going to be compelling to you, period. Propaganda works in this way, it is something you really would like to believe and the images and plot of the movie give you permission to believe like it's authors, and hence you are converted to their position, if you are not already a fellow traveller.

I'd like to believe things that are true.

What does it mean to be true? for example, did the birth mother of the boy killed in a motorcycle accident (yep, i ride a motorcycle, it's not a matter of if, but when and how bad) described in the bookstore, really die before? or even, did that incident happen? or where did he get the insight to answer in such a compelling way?

How we perceive the world around us matters. How we interact with people matters. The more positively, the more hopefully, the more responsively we act, in the long run the better response we will have. no surprise there. Uplifted spirits, positive attitude, etc are utilitarian, they do work, they will (again in the long run) make life better, more happy, more money, more spiritual insights blah blah blah. so what? truthfulness is not judged by it's utility or it's usefulness or even if it increases your bank account, truth is judged by it's truthfulness. Now can utility help us judge truthfulness? probable. The real, the true, the greater corresponding to reality, seems to be, and probably ought to be a hallmark of the true. However there are lots of useful lies in our societies, some of them have been very motivating and very compelling, but that doesn't make them right, only useful lies. and it is liars who seem to do best with useful lies, not honest people.

Is the universe friendly? is there a loving God that cares for His creation? does it matter if i was here or not? is the universe more than simply matter in motion? The movie, and i suppose the books he wrote will propose a consistent set of answers to these big important questions. The movie hints at some of the questions and answers a few of them. but there are a few questions to ask of these answers. One, how do we know, two, how do we identify the truth when we see it, and lastly, so what or why should i care?

The real answer that the movie proposes is because he had this experience, he heard this voice, and lots of people concur with him that it is good stuff and as a result he had lots of money and tried to do good with it when he got it. Essentially it is an argument from utility followed by goodness. It works and it makes things better, not just for him but for everyone around him. He inspires people, he motivates people, they have changed lives and everyone lives happily ever afterwards. Therefore the voice must be telling him true things. This is the answer to the how do we know question. Because it works, people get happy, some get wealthy, and everyone agrees that feeling good and positive and uplifted is a good thing, and this marks the truth.

Is the universe friendly? does it or God care about me, or about you? how do you know or how do you find out? when you have a potential answer, say these 3 books, how do you determine if he found The Truth, or at least a glimmer of it? not only are they good questions, which makes it a good movie that it asks and tries to answer them, but they are part of that constellation of the most important questions we can ask about our lives. For that reason alone the movie is to be recommended, because it asks the questions, something i suspect most people never really get the time to. for as the movie points out, we are all too busy making a living to make a life.

beyond the fact that i disagree with the basic system of the answers that the movie proposes, one problem is that it portrays the Christian answer to these questions as judgemental, God as a vengeful father-figure, with all the smugness and self righteousness of ""inclusive"" systems. the idea being that we(the new age, happy fellows, inclusive, universalist, God will save everyone because He is a loving God folks) don't know all the answers, except that we know anyone who is exclusive(makes any kind of claim that their is the right way or worse yet the only way) is wrong. The movie takes what i think are an excessive number of swipes at Christianity, big deal, lots of movies and books do, but i'd rather have them get the theology right that they criticise, rather than a parody of it.

But the big question really is the epistemological one. How do i know that the voice is real and it is telling him true things? (ignoring all kinds of auxillary question about transmission etc) If i sat down in my easy reading chair now, and a voice appeared to me and started telling me things, ought i to trust either my perception of the the voice or what it says? If an angel appeared before me with a manuscript should the experience validate what he/she/it tells me? do we trust our experiences, do we trust his? should we? how do we know? good questions, and for their asking i thank both the author and the movie.",1181260800,9,7038,4.399385560675883

That's what happpened when I went to the video store, and came across this movie being at the right place at the right time kind of thing. I was so moved and inspired by it and I could relate to the message and the downward rollercoaster ride that Neale Donald Walsch was going through in his journey to spiritual awaking and rising above all the chaos, struggle, resentment, anger, pain.....At one point in the movie, when he was awaken by the voice of God asking him,""Have you had enough?......Do you really want to hear all the answers to your questions?...."" I was so taken and affected starting that point(mid way) into the movie. I mean I myself had very similar experinces like Walsch, except I didn't have neck breaking accident, but it's just all the miserable things in life and failure, and financial problems, and rejections, all that built up and it's so unbearable and anyone would become angry at God. Walsch did, and I did too. Later on the movie, things do make sense to him as he started to reach out and ""talk"" to God. The writing of his inner conversations with God created a life altering best-selling book series. I got to say that the scene of a God-resentful woman trying to seek Walsch's explanation on be half of God as to why her adopted son had to be killed on his 18th birthday was so tearjerking. I found myself rewatching this movie immediately the second time. The lead is brilliantly played by veteran Canadian actor Henry Zcerny who had appeared in numerous big Hollywood movie, and most recently in Fido. I recommend this movie to anyone who has a lot questions for God, and those who are living in a lot of ""hell"", which I can certainly relate to, should give this a movie a viewing.

1583715,5,B00005JPJK,"I love movies that make me feel good about being human and human condition. There is always hope. And God never forgets us. He is with us always and sometimes the littlest thing or interaction with another human being is part of a much larger ""play"" that we are in.

I really enjoyed this movie. No special effects and a minimalist story...but very powerful. No matter now ""down"" your life may be...there is ALWAYS hope...ALWAYS.

And the best part was I was a juncture in my life where I could have gone ""down"" or ""up"" personally. The same day as my crisis I watched this movie and it made everything crystal clear and I took the high road. I was in tears of joy at the end of this movie.

I am reviewing my DVD collection and have decided to sell all the fluff movies to Half Price Books and keep ones that are spiritually uplifting. This one is a keeper!!!",1175904000,5,859,4.3229813664596275

1583750,5,B00005JPJK,"Though I am very much into this genre of books, those by Millman, Bach, Redfield and so on, I've always had a hard time really taking in conversations with God. I mean, where did this guy come from, where does he get off suggesting that one morning or day, God decides to just start talking to him. How am I suppose to swallow the idea of just some regular joe, being special enough or deserving enough to get to have this conversation with God. So in that alone, as great as so much of the messages are within the pages of these books, I have never been able to entirely accept them. Then along comes this movie. Tells an amazing story of a man who literally bottoms out in life. Who reaches a point that those of us who have/had the money to buy this book, pray to god to never reach. We get to see a man ready for good reason to just thrown in the towel and give up on life, finally hear a voice and tell him to get up. And from that experience comes a pouring out of words creating the book conversations with God. You know what I did when the movie ended? I went to my book shelf, pulled out Book 1 and started reading it again, with a whole new perspective on where these words came from. If you are a conversations with God fan, you must see this movie!!",1174348800,7,1261,4.109311740890688
1583751,5,B00005JPJK,"IF you see your life as a spiritual journey, this movie is a MUST HAVE

Not many movies today have you in deep reflection 24 hours later, 48 hours later and beyond. This one does achieve just that.

Neale Donald Walsch, as a messenger of the light, is a gift to the world at this turbulent time. As he embarks on a tour of the world reminding us of our Oneness, this movie reminds us of the meaningful life of this incredible man.

Down and out and in deep despair (can't we all identify with this at one time or other) Neale asks God what is it all about.

The answer he receives and makes the focus of his new life is movingly portrayed in this great movie.

Conversations with God not only touches the heart and brings tears to the eyes, but also deeply moves the soul.

What would love do? How well we could apply this to so many aspects of our lives on planet earth in 2007.

Buy this movie not only for your own soul but also for those souls of your loved ones and friends. It deserves a widespread audience - and it is one of those rare movies that will make a big difference.

This is just as Neale Donald Walsch is doing with every breath of his life - the one he reinvented so dramatically and so movingly and this is, of course, the subject of this great film.

The movie and the man are gifts to humanity. Thank God for them!",1173744000,6,1337,4.1312741312741315
1583752,5,B00005JPJK,"""Do you *really* want to know the answers to the questions you're asking?"" - God (from the movie)

In 1990, a man named Neale Donald Walsch experienced a car accident resulting in a broken neck, which propelled him into a downward spiral of job loss, poverty, and homelessness. Eventually, he began to ask existential questions that many people ask, ""What is the meaning of life? Why am I here?""

In 1995, he heard a voice asking, ""Have you had enough yet? Are you ready now?""

God had come calling to answer those questions--and many more. This question and answer format served as the basis for the Conversations with God series, as well as the books What God Wants and Home with God.

Conversations with God the movie dramatizes events leading up to those mystical dictations, flashing back to Neale's struggles with finding a job--and even finding food in alleyway dumpsters. Alone and with minimal personal belongings, Neale lived in a tent, scrounged soda cans for money, and pounded the pavement in the hopes of securing a stable job.

Slowly, things begin looking up when he gets a job as a weekend DJ and finds a decent place to live. But when the radio station becomes bankrupt, Neale begins to write down his frustrations and questions--and the results were an incredible gift to humanity.

I admit, after seeing the debacle Indigo (which starred Neale Donald Walsch), I didn't have high hopes for this movie. However, not only was I very surprised at the quality of Conversations with God, I was deeply moved. (And it was a Divine touch I sorely needed at the time.)

I was unaware of Neale's background until I watched this movie, and realizing what he had come through made his books even more meaningful. Stephen Simon, the co-founder of the Spiritual Cinema Circle and director of Somewhere in Time and What Dreams May Come, also directed the CWG movie.

The musical score was beautiful and moving, as was the cinematography. The writing was tight, with no word wasted, and the performances were truly top-notch. Henry Czerny gave an incredibly accurate portrayal as Neale--even capturing Neale's mannerisms and speech patterns. The supporting cast was also astounding--so props to the casting director, too!

At times incredible heartbreaking, Conversations with God can move you closer to your own divinity, encouraging you to realize that you're the one you've been waiting for...and that God will never leave you or forsake you.

Here are but a few wise nuggets from the movie:

""Instead of worrying about what people think about you--concentrate on what YOU think of you.""

""Don't disqualify or marginalize the message because the messenger is fallible.""

""What is God's most important message to humanity? `You've got me all wrong.'""

""My most common communication is through feeling. Feeling is the language of the soul. If you want to know what's true for you about something, look to how you're feeling about it.""

""A life without expectations of specific results--that's freedom.""

""Ask what would love do now and I'll be there always--in all ways.""

""I am not concerned about your worldly success...only you are. You are not to worry about making a living. True masters are those who have chosen to make a life--not a living. Go ahead--do whatever you really love. Do nothing else! You have so little time. Why would you want to waste it doing something you don't want to do? That isn't a living--it's a DYING.""

I found the Conversations with God DVD quite synchronistic. At one point, a question about personal direction popped into my head--and the phrase about worldly success answered it specifically...mere seconds later! Several times, I was moved to tears--and I was grateful for the reminder that God is as close as our breath--and that answers are readily available to our most personal questions. (Truth be told, it's more like I bawled my eyes out--especially during the last few minutes of the movie.)

Although I rented this movie through NetFlix, I loved it so much that I'm buying a copy through Amazon.com. It's definitely a movie to buy, especially since there are so many levels of meaning and wisdom found throughout.

Poignant, surprising, but ultimately soaring with inspiration, the Conversations with God movie arrived at the perfect time in my life. After reading several of Neale's books, it was fascinating to come to understand what he had been through prior to his revelations--and how this all-too-human vessel came to channel profound wisdom that has changed thousands of lives over the last decade.

1583753,5,B00005JPJK,"Fascinating true story of the author's life, extreme adversity and circumstances that ultimately led to the outpouring of divine messages. I've read the CWG books and they DID change my spiritual perspective and sparked an inner discernment that resonated truth within me.

1583755,5,B00005JPJK,Great movie.  It shows that if we quiet ourselves down we can speak to our God selves.  I don't believe you have to be in such a bad situation to do this type of communication.

1583756,4,B00005JPJK,"The difference between this movie and other spiritual films (The Secret, What the Bleep, Celestine Prophecy) is that this movie shows you how to be, what to do, and how to get to god.  It demands that the spiritual walk is one of compassion and human commitment, and not one of manifesting a million dollars overnight or learning how to heal plants or move atoms with your mind.  This very human message will come as a disappointment for some who are looking for a get-spiritual-quick scheme from this movie.  This is not a film about spiritual giftedness, it is a film about walking your very human walk, dealing with the opportunities for compassion that we pass on our way to work every morning, and learning that every moment is an opporunity to live your own conversation with god.",1172361600,43,786,4.681159420289855
1583757,4,B00005JPJK,"For those not familiar with the Conversations with God books this will act in some measure as an introduction.  It doesn't particularly outline the concepts of the books, but is rather the biopic of Neale Donald Walsch, and thus more a re-telling of elements of his later book Friendship with God.  I recommend that people watch this entertaining film as a true story of how one human being with many problems finally (and in the most amazing circumstances!) found a way to his own spirituality - then go and read the first few books - they will make a lot more sense then.

Having met Neale on a couple of occasions, three things in relation to this film: 1, Henry Czerny does a great job of the difficult task of playing Neale and relating his story, looking spookily like him and capturing some of Neale's mannerisms and attitude to life; 2, the film does a good job of capturing the essence of how we can connect to the deeper more spiritual parts of ourselves; 3,in no way is this film a ""vanity project"" as another reviewer of this film has claimed.  Neale would be the first person to agree that he has vanity, I'm sure!  But anyone who has met Neale, listened to him talking, or read his books in detail, knows why he made this film and it has nothing to do with vanity...",1171497600,14,1280,4.4297872340425535
