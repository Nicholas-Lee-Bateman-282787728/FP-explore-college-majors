This is the Torture Chamber Story II and should not be confused with the first DVD of the same name which is a completely different story and which I have not seen.
The movie is, oddly enough, exactly what it says in that it's a 'Torture Chamber Story'. Nothing in this movie is gratuitous, I'd say it's in your face violence, torture and cruelty and perversity fully depicted at it's best.
The story is a series of flashbacks and starts with our young heroine, Lotus,  being dragged into the torture chamber to be exceuted for the murder of the governor, Ma, by 1000 cuts and pieces of flesh being removed from her body before she dies.
We meet Ma as he was coming down from the mountains and is portaryed as a young virile graduate of a Taoist monk and he is going into the city to apply for a job as the general of the army. He is portrayed as a kind and perhaps naive young fighter when he meets up with a group of townsfolk robbers, Lotus, her brother and his wife and her fiance. Ma makes friends with the group and gets them to swear that they will stop the thievery and change to the path of good.
From that point we then meet the whole group again when Ma has become governor and gives jobs to the two young men at the governors mansion.
Since this is a Chinese Movie with English subtitles you have to understand that there are more twists and turns in this plot than a small road in the mountains. What we do get in the movie is bloos, a lot of it because remember Lotus is getting cut up into 1000 oieces and the movie shows that, we get cannibalism since the bandit leader enjoys eating the hearts of his live vitims, we get a lot of blood since most of the soldiers get their heads and arms cut off. I think I counted at least 15 arms getting cut off in this movie and at least 7 heads.
If that ain't bad enough, this movie also depicts tounges being cut out, at least 5, boiling wax poured into to ears .... OK why continue  I think you get the picture .... The sex and eroticism, well, I think you may have guessed they don't hold back the slightest here either since Ma, our hero, is sexually dysfunctional since he was raped by a pervert as a little boy .... Oh, and lastly, you remember the 1000 cuts for Lotus, you think they show the executioner coming up with his knife to cut apiece of flesh while the camera pans away and we hear her scream, nooooo not in this movie, we get to actually see the cuts of fleah as if we were med students in an operating room ....
Ok so I rated it five stars, not because I liked the movie, far from it, but if you ever wanted to see the most violent and perverse movie about torture, cruelty and perverse sex, then this is the movie for you .....",1007596800,67,2876,4.198915009041591
