So stupid! :)  But I remember watching every saturday afternoon to see if they were going to show an episode.  It was cheesy and fun.  And Geordie Johnson was so incredibly goreous.  I was watching ""The Changeling"" (which has Bernard Behrens in it for a few seconds) and I started thinking about this show.  I had to explain to my husband why I loved it so much.  He thinks I'm crazy...but those of us who loved it understand.  Alexander is a babe!",1139702400,5,525,4.395833333333333
2160926,5,B00062IYLY,"Blonde and sexy vampires, are the BEST!!!

and Geordie Johnson, certainly fitted the bill

in this BBC Television Series. That guy could

have put his shoes under my bed, anytime! I

mean come on, who wouldn't want to be in the

company of a suave, and debonair vampire, with

gobs of money? Bernard Behrens, Jacob Tierney,

Mia Kirshner, and Joe Roncetti, did a pretty

good job, as vampire hunters, though in one

episode, they actually accepted a dinner

invitation, at the castle of Alexander Lucard,

the same vampire, they were trying to eliminate

in the other 20 episodes. I like how they used

the name Lucard, which spells Dracul backwards.

The scenery, and color in all 21 episodes, is

beautiful, the acting pretty good, and the

humor, that was added to the script, is quite

refreshing. I really think more shows like

Dracula, should be made for television. If you

love blonde rich vampires, that are a real turn

on, then Dracula, is the show for you!!",1130803200,4,970,4.6946107784431135
2160927,4,B00062IYLY,"I remember this show from when i was like 10 and obsessed with all things vampiric. you know, castlevania games, vampire hunter d, etc etc. I used to love this show when i was 10 or 12, and have distinct fond memories of it. i always wondered what happened to it. well i sort of stumbled upon it at a local best buy for 10 bucks and i couldn't pass it up. 10 bucks for 21 episodes? now thats a deal!

i must admit, being no longer a pre-teen the show has lost a great deal of its magic for me. its still fun and campy but super cheesy. if i'd paid 40 bucks for this series i'd be a little disappointed. but for 10 dollars you cant possibly go wrong.

video-wise its a relatively clean transfer. who am i kidding its pretty spectacular given the fact that its a forgotten show from 15 years ago.",1114992000,5,794,4.083333333333333
2160928,5,B00062IYLY,"I've been a fan of this series for years, but never expected to see it released on video. Its witty dialog and campy presentation makes it quite a change from the serious, horrific treatment Dracula usually gets.  Blond Canadian actor Geordie Johnson does an excellent job presenting our favorite bloodsucker as a modern business man.  Bernard Behrens plays his enemy, Gustave Helsing, who is aided by three children (played by Mia Kirshner, Jacob Tierney and Joe Roncetti) in the quest to destroy Dracula. Forever Knight's Geraint Wyn Davies appears in several episodes and Dracula's student and sometimes rival. Serious Dracula/vampire fans will probably want to pass on it, but those willing to accept a broader view, it's a very enjoyable series!",1103241600,12,750,5.190082644628099
2160929,5,B00062IYLY,"Short-lived though it was when it first debuted, Dracula the Series *did* get a full run of 21 episodes (more than most fledgling series these days).  Starring a wonderful core cast, including Geordie Johnson as a sleek and dangerous (not to mention gorgeous!) Dracula, this series is a great bit of fun for kids and adults.  The cheesiness is there on purpose, when it shows up in a number of eps, but the dialogue throughout is always fun and clever.  I LOVED this series when it first came out, and I was about 15, and I still love it now at 30!",1098921600,8,548,4.352941176470588
2160930,5,B00062IYLY,"This is Dracula the Series - the fun series that aired in the early 90's - It stars Geordie Johnson as Dracula, and Bernard Behrens as Van Helsing, Geraint Wyn Davies has a recurring role as Klaus (this is pre-Forever Knight.)  The dvds are pretty high quality for being a 1990 television series. The two-disc set includes all 21 episodes of the series.  Fun for the whole family.",1098748800,20,380,4.573529411764706
8037136,5,B00062IYLY,"I was soooo obsessed with this show when it was first on television in the very early 90s and entirely crushed when it was pulled so quickly! I was relieved that I had been recording the episodes all along so at least I had those few to watch once it was gone.

Having only my battered, fifteen-year-old VHS tape of these shows to watch, I was so thrilled a few years ago when I saw this come out on DVD. (It is so obscure, I didn't think it would.) Once they arrived, I realized that I was missing several episodes that I hadn't managed to catch on VHS before the show was canceled, and so was doubly thrilled to have the DVDs.

It's campy with (at times) questionable acting (although not entirely surprising, given the material they had to work with), but actually had promise in the direction it was going, had a sense of humor, and I'm convinced that it if had been allowed to mature, it really would have been quite fantastic.",1295308800,,932,4.350574712643678
8037137,3,B00062IYLY,"I was watching the Dracula the series DVD set and I realized there is a pretty big mistake and this mistake dates back to the series' original air dates.

  The final episode of the series is Klaus Encounters of the Interned Kind.  This ends with the semi-cliff hanger of Gustav Helsing following Lucard (Dracula) and Klaus through a portal in Dracula's castle.  And the boys Christopher and Max preparing to return to America with all of Gustav's notes.  Yet someone made the mistake of airing the episode My Dinner with Lucard after Klaus Encounters of the Interned Kind.

  My Dinner with Lucard is a clips episode of all the previous episodes (leading up to Klaus Encounters of the Interned Kind) and turned out to be a dream of Gustav Helsing.  This is clearly set BEFORE he followed Lucard through the portal.  I do not know why it was aired in the wrong order or why the DVD set maintains this misorder.

Otherwise it's a great DVD set of a fun TV series in the vein (if you pardon the pun) of shows like Goosebumps.  The show focuses on the adventures of sixteen-year-old Christopher Townsend and his ten-year-old brother Max Townsend.  They take up residence with their Uncle Gustav Helsing who lives with a local student, Sophie.  Chris and Max soon learn that their uncle is actually a vampire hunter from a long line of vampire hunters and their biggest thread is Alexander Lucard, a highly successful and corrupt corporate mogul (sort of like David Xanatos of Gargoyles) who turns out to be Dracula himself.  It's a fun show but jut be wary of the mistake in the episode order.",1290556800,,1590,4.645161290322581
8037138,5,B00062IYLY,"It's always better when the actors appear to enjoy their roles.  Think how different Freddy Krueger would have been if Robert Englund wasn't having a blast playing him.

My take on it is that this Dracula has discovered that pure evil is boring.  He still wants to rule the world, but why rush it when you have eternity?  He acts more like he wants to eventually become a benevolent dictator and have as much fun as possible doing it.  One of the games he plays is to exaggerate himself in front of Helsing and the kids.  His behavior towards Helsing makes me think of Q toward Picard in ST:TNG. Lucard could have them all killed with a phone call if he really wanted to (the Magyar cross only protects against vampires, not hitmen).

Lucard has no aversion to modern technology, so of course his castle has hidden cameras and a state-of-the art security system.  He'd have to because someone like him has more enemies than just other vampires and a goofy old man.  Yet the kids never have any trouble getting in and Lucard's servants never seem to be around to stop them.  How could that be unless Lucard doesn't mind the kids visiting?  Helsing is just comic relief to Lucard.

While outwardly menacing, though always in a campy way, Lucard is actually pretty protective of the children.  When you combine the best security system money can buy with a vampire's hearing, it's a safe bet that Lucard is well aware of everything that happens in his home. In one episode he sends them on a wild goose chase to get them out of harm's way while he deals with the unstable Klaus.

For all of Lucard's wealth, power and servants, he's lonely.  He tolerates Helsing because he's not a real threat, it's fun to mess with him and the kids like him.  Lucard likes the kids and the mother and is trying to befriend them.  He can't do it directly because they wouldn't believe it so he keeps luring them over so that they can see that he has his own sense of honor and fair play and draw their own conclusions. Transforming the mother was a not-too-subtle way of introducing to the kids the idea of them being a family.

Like Edward Herrman in The Lost Boys, he wants a family. Unlike Herrman's character, he wants to become a father figure to the children before he transforms them.  Lucard wants it all: power, wealth, and a family to share it with.",1251590400,3,2340,4.48936170212766
8037139,5,B00062IYLY,"Dracula: The Series is an entertaining show that employs a bit of campy suspense, dark humor and a talented cast to bring the caped one to life.  Alexander Lucard (played by Georgie Johnson) plays Drac the corporate raider and manages to invoke a love/hate response as he seeks out to destroy his nemeses at one moment, and join up with (or seek assistance from) at another.  The younger of the cast (Jacob Tierney, Joe Roncetti, Mia Kirshner) are the epitome of the kid vampire hunter under the guidance of Uncle Gustav Helsing (Bernard Behrens).  The show is part Goonies, part Buffy (without ""the chosen one"" curse), and was one of the greats in the early 90's when vampire themed shows hit the tube for another round.",1216166400,,721,4.7063492063492065
8037140,5,B00062IYLY,"I enjoyed the two-pack Dracula series with its blend of fun and horror. The plots are believable and the acting is excellent. The part of Dracula is very well played by Geordie Johnson but 10-year-old Jacob Tierney (as Max) almost steals the show in some of the episodes. Jacob is well supported by teenagers Joe Roncetti and Mia Kirshner. Bernard Behrens as Uncle Gustav rounds out the well balanced cast. It is a great pity that the TV series doesn't go beyong 21 episodes. It is, indeed, a five star product.",1214956800,,511,4.626373626373627
8037141,5,B00062IYLY,"I have been searching for this series for years and only recently started browsing on Amazon.com.  Why I never thought to search for this series here sooner, I don't know.  I thought the price for this 2-disc set was very reasonable and the quality is nice.  Brings back very fond memories of my teenage years when I watched this show as often as I could.  I even got to see a few episodes I missed.  Amazon's communication was excellent regarding order processing and shipment notification.  I qualified for super saver shipping with my order and it was well worth saving nearly 7 bucks for a couple extra days' wait.  Good ship time, too!  I love this series; amusing and fun to watch.  So glad Amazon.com carry it!  I notice they sell the two discs separately, but the 2-disc set seems a much better deal.  I just wish they'd made more episodes; I really can't get enough of the characters and my favorite is Dracula, himself.  Geordie Johnson can bite me anytime, lol!  Along with another product I bought that was shipped separately, this was my first shopping experience with Amazon.com and it was overall a very pleasant experience and I will return as often as I can to order other products.",1214265600,,1199,4.625592417061611
8037142,5,B00062IYLY,"Friends and I used to throw a frozen pizza in the oven, pop a can of soda and spend hours watching the episodes of this series that I had taped.  I had monitored Lucard's Home Page for years as one of those fans who remembered and loved this show when younger.  Is it a bit campy? Oh yeah! Does it have a dark edge?  You bet! Is it worth seeing...WITHOUT A DOUBT!  I had only sincerely HOPED that this show would come out on DVD, and it finally happened.  I bought copies for all my friends who used to watch this with me, and we still love it.  Too bad it never made it past the first season!  I recommend this show because it is the classic funny, witty, and yet edgey television we had in the late 80s and early 90s...less melodrama,less inuendo, more fun!  At this price, you could take a chance and if you love it...you have a gem in your collection.  If you do not love it, you did not lose a thing!

I sincerely recomment this DVD set!",1211328000,,942,4.098360655737705
8037143,5,B00062IYLY,A very likeable TV show that I like and also my 8 year old granddaughter loved it.  The vampire is the most handsome I've seen so far.  It is  pretty mild and OK for children.  A cute series.,1207440000,,191,3.9473684210526314
8037144,5,B00062IYLY,"Remember when Vampires were powerful, blood-thirsty and handsome? Well the 90's brought us Dracula the Series and it's everything you love about vampires and more. It's loaded with fun, laughter, pun's and oh yeah, vampires thirsty for blood.  The series growing up was so addictive it was like running home from school to watch your favorite cartoon in the favored 3-5pm time slot. The quality was great, the sound was awesome (especially the beloved theme music complete with synth, drum, and echo sound) and I'm so glad I bought the series.  At an ubelievable price, you can't resist.",1188000000,2,587,4.979591836734694
8037145,4,B00062IYLY,"I used to love this show, it came on before the Dark Shadows Revival Series.  I really wish they had continued it or revisted it at a later time.

Geordie Johnson makes this series as Alexander Lucard, AKA Dracula.  He has a vast stage presence and seems to really get into playing Dracula.  Not to mention he is quite easy on the eyes.

Geraint Wyn Davies is another hilight.  He plays Klaus and is spectacular.  When he and Johnson are on the screen together it's amazing.  He also has this Welsh accent that comes out once in awhile, and it's adorable.

The series is cheesy, but in a cute way.  It's polka and schnitzel (Hot and steamy!)  all the time.  Sometimes things don't make much sense, but the series is so much fun you just won't care.

And I always got the idea the little war between Helsing and Alex was a love/hate thing, which adds an interesting dynamic to the series.

I was dissapointed with the ending, however.  But it doesn't ruin the series, not at all.

The Decline of the Romanian Vampire is my fave episode.

As for the DVD itself...There are no special features, you can't skip or fast forward unless you want to go to the next peisode.  The transfer is good, but overall, the DVD could have a little more on it.

WORTH the money though...God yes.",1140393600,6,1276,4.422413793103448
