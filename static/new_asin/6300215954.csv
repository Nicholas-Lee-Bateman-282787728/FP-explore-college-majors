253400,5,6300215954,"Howard Hawks must be considered a pioneer in what nowadays is called ""ecological movement"". In 1962 he produced and directed a wonderful movie with all the necessary sketchs of a comedy. John Wayne  always as John Wayne:you watch the movie and you believe in what you're  seeing. That's his secret. The photography is one of the best in the  history of cinema. The music excellent. Wild animals running in the sabana  and the trappers just running over them with a jeep and an old truck in  order to catch them without shooting a single bullet. That's why is in my  opinion the first ecological movie.",961113600,,601,4.6761904761904765
253401,5,6300215954,"A very nice comedy!  John Wayne made one of very  best his movie. Red Buttons is memorabile.  Great music too, everythink it is  wonderful.",957052800,,139,4.666666666666667
253402,5,6300215954,"A fine combination of action, romance, comedy and the battle of the sexes.  Wonderfully scored by Henry Mancini and with the Mancini touch, capturing every mood and lifting the action and suspense.",956534400,2,197,5.15625
253403,1,6300215954,"I got to rent this movie (for free, thankfully) a few days ago. This has to be the most boring John Wayne movie I've ever seen, and I've seen many! There's no plot, so for over two hours not much happens. Red Buttons is a  typically unfunny early 60's comic and just gets worse as the movie drags  on. The accents of the international cast are distracting and some are  unbelivable. John Wayne was just to old to play the romantic leading man  part and it shows in this movie. Half of the scenes in Hatari could've been  cut out and nothing would be missed. Watch this on TV if your dying to see  it but don't spend any money buying or renting it!",956102400,6,647,4.17741935483871
253404,4,6300215954,"This is not a typical John Wayne movie. Although Wayne plays his typical strong, silent man role, he is served a come-uppance by a woman... and by 3 baby elephants!

253405,5,6300215954,"Some movies are simply a joy to be in the presence of.  Hatari! is one of these.  As in practically every other Hawks movie, the characters are cool and subtle in their delivery and interaction with one another, and while a  first-time viewer will marvel at the wildlife action shots and the African  scenery, the reason one will return to the movie is to see the performances  of Hardy Kruger, John Wayne, Elsa Martinelli, and Red Buttons, and how they  interact together throughout.  A very cute and pleasant and entertaining  movie. I've seen it countless times.",925257600,9,565,4.8125

253477,5,6300215954,"there's a real mixture of young and old worlds meeting here. the kids have a ranch in Africa and the Duke is sort of drunkenly in charge. No one's told him about the women's movement. No one's told anyone about animal cruelty and crap like that. They drink a lot, make terrible off color references without a blink. You just gotta watch this with your blinders on and enjoy the quaint old fashioned racism and sexism and sheer alcoholism of it all. It's all done in fun and no real alcohol was drunk, and no real bones were broken it's a movie. If a woman has an opinion she can voice it but can't expect to be taken seriously, and if a girl suddenly becomes a woman she can expect sexual advances but not sober ones. Keep in mind all this happens while they're surrounded by Africans who have nothing to say about the rape of their country and the low level abuse they endure as second and third class citizens by people who can't see them as human.",1523577600,,950,4.312849162011173

253479,4,6300215954,"Tanganyika (now Tanzania) was such a beautiful location I have to give the movie only 4 starts. Howard Hawks did spend a lot of time on location with his lens pointed out toward the beauty of the location..but even then, not enough. The landscape was gorgeous I wanted more..
The story line was perfect for the intertwined ""light"" romance, action and beauty out on the African velt and humorous reactions between the characters . Not ha ha belly laugh but very little in the movie that could ever pass for even light ""DRAMA.

253687,5,6300215954,"Sean Mercer (John Wayne) and his co-workers are in the business of capturing wild African animals for zoos. They fill a quota of exotic animals including the dangerous rhinos. They take on a representative D'Allesandro; the representative turns out to be a woman (Elsa Martinelli) and of course this is man's work. To top this off the female that grew up with them is coming of age and stirring up some rivalry for here affections.

All the people and situations are fun to watch. Some are a little cutesy, but they work. For example in one scene, all the animals watch on apprehensively as a thorn is pulled out of one's side. They play ""Baby Elephant Walk (Instrumental)"", as Elsa Martinelli becomes a surrogate mother. Will the Indian (Bruce Cabot) survive his deadly encounter with the rhino? When they capture the monkeys look closely at the bird cage helmet. Is it the same one used in ""Bachelor in Paradise"" (1961)?

Not only is this a good movie with the standard Wayne formula, but it also has many of the actors that travel from one John Wayne movie to another.",1501459200,,1071,4.661375661375661

253785,4,6300215954,"This is a lengthy John Wayne action movie set in Africa.  John Wayne leads a group of adventurous males who capture animals live for zoos.  They chase the animals across the plains in a truck and capture them live.  Along the way, the men engage in drinking, smoking and fist fights.  I watched this movie and a child and thought it was about the best movie I ever saw and secretly felt I could quit studying in school, as I had found my calling.  I mean how educated do I have to be to chase animals in trucks in Africa, living a life of a ""man's man""?  I was a very deep thinker.

John Wayne carries this movie, as he could at the time.  He is the only truly big star in the movie.  The musical score is excellent.  Henry Mancini does a great job with the music.

Watching this movie as an adult, I see it somewhat differently.  Capturing animals in that manner is now illegal.  Every animal actually captured has seen the last day of their natural life.  I suppose it reflects my evolution as an individual, for better or for worse.

For what it is worth, one of the best narratives I have ever read on this movie is within the biography ""John Wayne: The Life And The Legend"" by Scott Eyman.  That book is very comprehensive and this movie is not a prominent part of this biography, but it is detailed.  Thank You...",1489104000,,1319,4.275303643724697

John Wayne catches wild animals in Africa for zoos and the circus. It's an adventure movie, comical at times, and also a romantic movie. I ordered the DVD immediately when I saw that Amazon had it for only $4.00 and watched it as soon as it was delivered to me. DVD played fine and I enjoyed seeing it once again!

John Wayne owns a professional wild game hunters ranch in Africa, they capture wild animals for zoos and circus, using jeeps and trucks, and of course it's funny watching them trying to catch them using rope rigging. Of course it's dangerous too, but you will love when a lady joins the group to take pictures and she rescued a baby elephant, just think of everything it takes to raise an elephant and she's a city girl, the laughs don't stop with this movie.

My son has never really been allowed to watch John Wayne movies so far because they're sometimes too graphic or have too-adult themes.  (He's 8 at the time I write this review.)  This one was one I allowed him to watch, and he enjoyed every minute of it, even though it's longer than the average movie.  His eyes never left the screen.  And Henry Mancini's music is always so wonderful, and he did an extra fantastic job on the music for Hatari.  You won't regret watching this one - the music, the animals, the gorgeous African vistas.  The characters are fun and easy to love, especially Red Buttons as Pockets.

Hatari is about a business who's primary job is to round up wild African animals for zoos and parks.  Led by Wayne's character you get to see the way the group goes and does that and a lot of outdoor scenes.  The really silly parts are in there with one of the characters becoming mother to one, then two then three baby elephants.  This is when Herb Alpert's musical score the 'BABY ELEPHANT WALK"" comes in. Good clean fun a little laugh and a lots of A lister stars makes for a good movie",1468454400,,610,4.084033613445378

254114,4,6300215954,"So i'm stuck, as I usually get when writing reviews about my favorite classic movies. I'm torn between writing the review about the actual disc and it's special features versus the movie's story, etc. I always stick with what the blu-ray disc has to offer, since it looks so much better than DVD. Most of the time i end up getting ripped by hardcore John Wayne fans when i give a movie 2 stars because it has terrible or NO Special Features.
To be somewhat fair for Hatari!, I'll give the review 4 Stars and will explain why.

The movie itself (story, actors, acting, excitement) gets a 5 Star rating from me. Unfortunately, this Blu-Ray only offers a cleaner film. You know, without the fuzzy, graininess of a 50 year old movie. I always have high hopes that when these movies come out on a new disc or are updated, they'll have Special Features that give more or any insight on the film. This has ZERO! There's no need for that. We would all love to see some Wayne interviews and what it was like to film on location. It's really a shame for us John Wayne fans.
My suggestion is to Youtube or look the movie up on IMDB for facts and info.",1467504000,,1140,4.327102803738318

This cinematic atrocity is so bloody rotten it will gag a maggot. VIEW AT YOUR OWN RISK, NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN,PETS,THE ELDERLY,OR ANYBODY.",1464393600,,672,5.008928571428571

John Wayne delivers as he always does, the man had more than his fair share of charm, he deftly handles this comedy with his usual aplomb.  Its a fun film.  The animals are amazing.  The three elephants are adorable; they even have their own theme song!  And how handy, they filmed the movie on Hardy Krugers Ngorongoro farm in Tanganyika Territory.  A nearly perfect adventure film but for the constant intrusion of Red Buttons and his wild eyed-loony grin brand of comedy.

254297,5,6300215954,"John Wayne may be the star of Hatari!, but Elsa Martinelli steals the show.  Yes, the African scenery is nice, but Martinelli is drop-dead gorgeous, even when she has curlers in her hair, white glop on her face and baggy pajama tops on her torso.  Hard to envision another woman who looks and acts as breathtakingly chic as Martinelli does in slacks and a sleeveless blouse. Even in safari duds she dazzles. With her lovely Italian accent, short auburn hair, bright brown eyes and a smile as sweet as flowers, she is impossible to forget. Want more? She plays a great boogie-woogie on the piano, dances like a dream, chain-smokes up a storm, trains a baby elephant and dispenses kissing lessons. Then there are those beautiful bare legs of hers. We first glimpse them when, pantless, she easily hurdles a waist-high wall. Near the end, those memorable gams appear again as she races colt-like through the streets of a busy Tanganyikan city. She is clad this time in a fashionable olive-green suit and heels. A more adorable creature cannot be imagined.",1458345600,,1052,4.806629834254144

But the true stars of this film were the animals, which were being humanely trapped for a zoo. Enter the photographer to take pictures of the trapping process for the zoo, only it's not a man, as expected, but a very fine looking Elsa Martinelli who reduces the men to lumps of jello. With direction from Howard Hawks and musical score by Henry Mancini if you haven't seen this movie, you have really missed something. Note: Mancini wrote ""Baby Elephant Walk"" for this film. It later made the Top 40 list.",1455494400,2,660,4.508333333333334

I watched this with my husband and his parents Christmas night here at our home, where we live surrounded by our petting zoo. I liked it ok. They thought it was terrible. My FIL apologized for suggesting we watch it, repeatedly :) The acting is terrible, I agree, but we watch this because it's John Wayne, not an academy award winning presentation. None of his movies ever achieved that status. I think it's ok, worth seeing The Duke in a roll other than the classic rough and tough cowboy.",1453161600,,741,4.496296296296296

254407,5,6300215954,"""Hatari"" is the Swahili word for ""danger,"" and there's plenty of that in this 1962 adventure story, along with comedy, romance, large game animals, and the beautiful exotic landscape of Africa.  The movie was filmed entirely on location in Tanganyika, on the east coast of equatorial Africa.  Stunning vistas of a rapidly disappearing world provide a backdrop for John Wayne, Elsa Martinelli, Red Buttons to work their classic movie magic.  It's just as enjoyable now as it was 54 years ago.

My only complaint about the film was that it cuts off so abruptly just when things are going so outstandingly well.  It would have been nice to spend quite a bit more time in the domestic life of folks engaged in providing animals for zoos around the word; but the film was already running well past the bladder-factor point so obviously they had to cut a lot of fun footage and cut the final validation, so that the story of how the main characters' lives have changed is left to the imagination.",1451952000,,990,4.699421965317919

It is as good an action film as any without the miracle of modern technology.  And it is hard to beat the music of Henry Mancini (The Elephant Walk).

We watch it twice a year, at the beginning of Spring,
and again at the end of Summer.
It is enjoyable, no matter how many times you watch it.
It was such a different story line from what John Wayne
fans came to expect, and from what we saw from him in
future movies.
Sadly, we have lost many that were in the cast, but the good
side of that is, they will ""always be with us"", in the work
they left behind.
This unique story about the wilds, and wild animals of Africa, has
a bit of everything........action, humor, romance, comedy.....
It is a must have for any John Wayne fan, or to complete a
movie collection.",1433203200,,666,4.2109375

254922,5,6300215954,"This is one of the best African wildlife movies ever made, filled with a stellar cast and memorable scenes.

Great, that is of course, if a member of your family isn't trying to quit smoking.

This has got to be pinnacle of all movies when it comes to smoking on screen.  Every second, in  almost every scene, cigarettes are the silent actors, sucked in and blown out continuously throughout the film.

If another film exits where actors smoke more, I'd like to know about it.  And if there is one, it's probably illegal to watch in California.

So, if you're trying to quit smoking, don't watch this movie.  In fact this movie should be off-limits to those who are trying to quit, if only to be merciful.  Or, a warning label should be affixed to the front cover to prepare them to suffer if they're brave enough to go through with it.

Other than that, it's a family, fun-filled extravaganza!

Enjoy, you lucky non-smokers.",1422403200,,925,4.579268292682927

254948,5,6300215954,"Hatari! Is a movie that is perfectly formulated to interest families with boys who are about 8 to 11.  The movie follows an international crew of men who are capturing African big-game animals for zoos across the world.  The men are led by John Wayne (played here as ""Sean"").

The critical crisis in the movie is capturing a live Rhino.  The opening scenes show a Rhino escape after goring ""The Indian"" (Bruce Cabot).  There are also other things, Red Buttons (called ""Pockets"") captures many monkeys after using a rocket and a net, and Elsa Martinelli (playing a photographer ""Dallas"") becomes a mother to several elephants.  There is also a bit of a love triangle which works itself out as the movie advances.

By no means is this movie deep, spiritual, or meaningful. It is chaste entertainment with plenty of action.  All the men in the team are action-adventure types wearing cool, action-adventure wardrobes.  The women are perfect mother types, although not married mothers themselves-yet.  In short this movie would be a super hit for the boys in every Cub Scout Pack across the nation.

There is also a bit of time capsule in this movie.  In 1962 Africa was either still under the control of European colonists or just freed.  In this movie the African city shown in the climactic scene is and orderly frontier town with many Indian shop-keepers and Europeans.  If Hatari! was filmed in Africa again, it is likely that the town would be a wreck.  Additionally, everyone in the movie is smoking.  There are cigarettes in nearly every scene.  The year 1964 was the high point of American cigarette consumption and one can see that in the contemporary movie.

This is one of the few John Wayne movies where The Duke gets the girl. Every minute of this film is fun.",1421971200,,1770,4.747540983606557

Looks like John and the cast had a great time making this movie(aka-McClintock,North to Alaska).Movie is somewhat dated but enjoyable just the same. However this is an inferior blueray transfer. Too much grain ,washed and weak color transfer in scenes and back ground scenery. Sound is ok but nothing special. If you own the dvd than I would keep it. You may be disappointed in the blueray as I was. If you don't own it than it than this may be a good purchase to make. It's John Wayne and the price is right.

255267,4,6300215954,"Good stuff, though he film relies on the charm of its animals and John Wayne's breezy tolerance and bravery (he's really out there on the prow of a speeding jeep lassoing wildebeests and rhinos. no stunt doubles) but as for a Hawksian romantic adventure it has one thing his other comedy-adventures didn't and that thing is Red Buttons, a very unfortunate decision: moving in on other girls' women, whining, and--what's worse--stealing all the ice, he's totally out of sync with the Hawks vibe of the group. That he winds up with the only other girl aside from Wayne's is inexcusable. Imagine if Walter Brennan stole Bacall in TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT (1944) or walked off with Joanne Dru in RED RIVER (1948)? He did actually steal Frances Farmer, or at least pick her her up where Ed Arnold dumped her off, in COME AND GET IT (1936).  In Hawks' no-nonsense approach, any girl can get stolen by any other older man. He should know. Bogie stole Bacall before he could even get her unwrapped.",1410480000,,986,4.634285714285714

255383,4,6300215954,"The movie is entertaining and will keep your attention to the end.  The story is of an odd assortment of characters including a race car driver, a matador, a journalist and the manager of a safari outfit that earns its living in the dry season in the present day Tansania ( in the Ngorongoro Crater) from capturing young live big game animals.  They have rented a farm at the foot of Kilimandjaro that has become a city by the name Arusha and used it as the base camp for their collection.  The original farm building of that day became  the Arusha Hotel of today,  full of memorabilia of that time.  The characters are played by John Wayne (the manager), his white hunter and game driver Hardy Kruger (of Taxi to Tobruk fame), the journalist Elsa Martinelli, Michele Girardon as the farms owner, Gerard Blain as Chips, Bruce Cabot as Little Wulf, the game catcher, and Valentine  de Vargas as the ""matador"".  The scenes are riveting, the photography (cinematography) is excellent, the baby animals are lovable, and at the end of the film one realizes that one had a good time watching.",1407196800,,1086,4.649214659685864

Cons: Of course, being the 1960's, everyone in the movie has a cigarette smoking - continuously! Then again, it could be a good oppertunity to discuss the dangers of smoking with your children as 98% of the cast are dead.

255564,5,6300215954,"I hadn't seen this movie since I was a kid, but my girlfriend and I watched it a few nights ago and it was just as wonderful as I remembered.  This film has just about everything. The acting is rather 1960's Hollywood, but it is so much fun.  The scenery is breathtaking, accompanied by a perfect Henry Mancini score. The fashions are so '60's avant garde... picture working that into a film set in the African bush.

The film covers a crew in Africa that captures exotic animals for international zoos over the course of a catching season.  There are thrills and spills, near misses, and serious accidents.  When the zoo sends an Italian photographer who happens to be a beautiful woman, the romantic comedy sparks fly. The best part of the movie is watching the cast have fun.  Each evening after a grueling and often near fatal day of work, the crew rushes back to base to clean up for dinner and a cocktail party with sultry Mancini music on the phonograph, dancing, drinking, and wooing the two beautiful females in camp.

Hatari may not be high art, but it is just so much fun!",1401667200,,1083,4.494897959183674

I really enjoyed it, and recommend it.  There is, however, a copious amount of smoking in the film--a reflection of the time it was made in.  A fun way to get lost in a story for a couple of hours.  Love the theme music.  I am not a fan of ""shoot 'em ups"" or westerns, but really liked this film.  This is just a flick made for pleasure, no underlying messages or statements.  There are three movies John Wayne made that I really am really fond of, and this is one of them",1401494400,,715,4.1911764705882355

255606,5,6300215954,"A rather long movie; nearly 2 1/2 hours, but it keeps your attention pretty well.  It has some funny moments; the ostrich round-up for one, and some serious ones.  Red Buttons shines as one of Wayne's co-workers who is amusing when sober and even more so when drunk.  Once you get past the outer trappings (big-game hunter, beautiful woman photographer, baby elephants, etc) the formula has a lot in common with his westerns.  Larger-than-life man has dangerous job, meets some problems head on, has some set-backs, gets one or more of his followers hurt/killed, meets beautiful woman that he fusses with, and then it all irons out.  But like most of his movies, it's entertaining; with action and a little comedy mixed in.  It was a novelty seeing the Duke in a truck instead of on a horse, but he was still the Duke.  The baby elephants are too cute for words and Henry Mancini's incredible score, especially the ""Baby Elephant Walk"" is a joy to listen to.  Animals Rights activists will hate this movie, though, as it depicts animals being captured for zoos and circuses, so if that kind of thing bothers you, it might be better to choose another movie.",1399593600,5,1156,4.688118811881188

255631,5,6300215954,"For those of you who didn't grow up with John Wayne you don't know what you missed.  He was one of a kind and he knew his audience like no other movie star before or since.  When he was young the women swooned over him and he became a sex symbol over night then when WWII came he became a symbol of what America was fighting for and solidified his top ten box office position from which he never strayed.  Perhaps more than any other actor he paid attention to what he did on screen that clicked with his audience and he was willing to be what they wanted and so when other actors got old and fell by the way side 'The Duke' as he was called (after a dog he'd had as a boy that hung around fire stations with its owner) was smart enough to age gracefully and start taking on those patriarchal roles that made him an institution among living Americans.  The two at least and sometimes more movies he made a year became events and swung between his quintessential westerns to fun family fare best exemplified by McLintock (his top moneymaker) and this sprawling look at an Africa we'll never see again.

This movie is basically a John Wayne movie dressed up as an African travelogue and he made it primarily because he wanted his family to see Africa before 'we spoiled it' as he so astutely put it.  It's also probably the hardest action movie he ever made as he and Howard Hawks (one of the two go to Directors he had over his career the other being John Ford) disdained stunt men for this shoot and that really is mostly the cast doing those incredible shots of gathering up those zoo animals throughout the movie, especially John Wayne, he reveled in it I think mostly showing off for the family but still putting the movie's main acting asset in harms way a lot of the time.  But in this particular case he was upstaged, which didn't happen too darn often, by the animals and Africa itself in this movie.  The plot is thin but fits the fun and some of the most spectacular African Scenery and close up look at the native animals fueled up and fighting back.  It also marks one of the last time 'The Duke' let himself be half of the romantic triangle.  Red Buttons and three baby elephants provide the comedy relief (tho all the cast acquits themselves of impeccable comic timing throughout) in the movie but I don't want to spoil too much if you haven't seen it.

It's family friendly and the kids will still be awed by the animals, bored by the mushy parts, and rallied by the action scenes and the comedy bits.  It's just a grand time for all and with Henry Mancini scoring the music it couldn't go wrong.  The Duke transitioned into an institution and we adults were beginning to realize how much we loved the fact that he never cheated us up there on the screen and always gave us what we wanted to see. And that's why we continued to go to his two films a years knowing we'd enjoy every minute no matter how many times we'd seen him do it before, we were rooting for him, we wanted him to be The Duke til his last breath, and damned if he wasn't!!  He was broke a couple of times in his career and once he said part of it was that he never skimmed the budgets and put every dime in every scene there was to spend.  I believe him.  He got tarnished a bit by politics towards the end but everybody did on both sides but he never gave us less than we paid for at the movie theater.  Hatari! is one of his best entertainments ever and you'll enjoy the heck out of it I promise you!!!

Kind of a long rambling review but I tend to wax nostalgic when I think about The Duke and I assure you there's about 70 million baby boomers out there who do too.",1399334400,3,3652,4.237752161383285

(This topic wasn't one of concern in the early 60's, as so many now find it an atrocity).

The film is a delightful adventure movie, shot on location in Africa, with wonderful photography by Russell Harlan who got an Oscar nomination for it. The cast is delightful, led by the great John Wayne, with wonderful performances by Elsa Martinelli and Red Buttons. In short, a must have for fans of Wayne and the genre.
Unfortunately the tranfer presented here is a very poor job, poor definition, too much de-noising and edge enhancement, well, in a word, a mess! After such fabulous presentations of Classic movies such as Ten Commandments, The Robe, To Catch a Thief, Airport, Singin' in the Rain, to name a few, this is a slap on the face. Especially since this was shot in Technicolor, what I think was the best color process ever and that has been yielding great blu-ray releases. It is not enough that the titles chosen for blu-ray release since last year have been in the appaling to dismal category, with great titles being unjustly overlooked in favor of recent drivel, on top of that, one the few opportunities of bringing a great looking movie  from the '60's to blu-ray has miserably misfired!

Also, the buttons don't work, and I couldn't get into the extras, or jump chapters. Forget about the aspect ratio--just the size of my 55' TV. Sound is also mediocre, to say the least. This is one of the few movies made with Howard Hawks/Wayne. The latter is a foot taller than all those around him, and he falls for the slight Elsa Martinelli; and they don't connect.

I decided to view it and again John Wayne did his usual great acting job. The supporting cast was also very good. The story was a little weak, but it was still entertaining.

Hatari is my favorite John Wayne movie. Adorable, exciting, even cute. And I like Hardy Krueger and Red Buttons characters too.

My late father used to say ""you can stop any John Wayne movie and start a different John Wayne movie at the same point and it would mesh seamlessly"". This was the movie I would always use to refute that.

But the DvD won't play in my laptop; you know, the way most people watch movies nowadays. I had to dig my old DvD player out and hook it up to the TV. PITA. Typical greedy Hollywood attitude: screw em, they're just customers, who needs 'em.",1379721600,,592,4.363636363636363

I, however, being a John Wayne fan watched this movie as a child and was thoroughly entertained by it then and I still am.  The music, the action, and the comedy are still great.

And this is a movie made over fifty years ago! Beautifully filmed, take care - it is easy to crave a trip on safari shortly afterward! John Wayne, in a comic foil to the excellent Red Buttons, clearly enjoys his African adventure and it is impressive to see he and the actors actually in some of the dangerous scenes such as when they capture that uber violent rhino.

Anyone who ever wondered about how some of the larger zoo animals are captured would find this movie educational as well as exciting to watch.

Some of the attempts at humor were a little stale and trite, and there was little, if any, story line, but the photography and scenery more than compensated.

256311,4,6300215954,"HATARI means danger in Swahili. John Wayne is Bwana Sean Mercer, a great white game hunter, turned live trapper, in Tanganyika (now Tanzania) in Africa of course. Can you buy that? Well just substitute the ball cap for a cowboy hat; the big game rifle for a Winchester 73; and the 4WD vehicles for a horse and you have John Wayne playing a cowboy in Africa...which just about sums up what he does here. Howard Hawks directed this and as other have noted the plot is a little sparse...as was typical of Hawks big productions as he concentrated on relationships between characters. The story is bookended by the initial rhinoceros chase where Bruce Cabot, as The Indian, is gored and the final rhinoceros chase which concluded the trapping for the season. In addition to Wayne and Cabot, you will be treated to Hardy Kruger, the quintessential German Aryan; Red Buttons, who delivers a delightful performance as...Red Buttons; and two beauties of the era, Elsa Martinelli and Michele Girardon, who serve mostly as eye candy, but get to do a little acting too. The music score is by Henry Mancini, one of his best; including the introduction of the memorable, BABY ELEPHANT WALK. The chase scenes are exciting and the African scenery is breathtaking.",1360368000,4,1247,4.859154929577465

256314,1,6300215954,"Maybe the tobacco companies paid for this film because everyone except the monkeys smokes.  They smoke while they are hunting, while they play cards, while they eat, while they talk.  Oh yeah there is an alleged story during all of this.

Seems John Wayne, Red Buttons, and assorted other European actors are all members of a company that captures wild animals for zoos.  Using beat up old trucks Wayne sits in a bucket seat on the front of a truck, driven by Red Buttons to rope rhinos, giraffes and lord knows what else.  The climax, if you can call it that, is the capturing of the man eating monkeys using a rocket invention developed by Red Buttons.  The actors wear all sorts of protective clothing like plastic space helmets and hockey pads (always avail in Africa) to protect them from biting monkeys.

There is a mild, confusing love interest somewhere along the line.  Marching elephants and plenty of cigarettes and booze round out this thriller.  If you enjoy watching people lighting up, drinking down and chasing animals in old trucks then this is your movie!",1359936000,3,1073,4.756756756756757

You would expect him to be on a horse out West, well he is in Africa, not on safari but gathering up animals, with a lot of good actors and bringing you to the chair to sit and watch all the fun and danger in gathering them up for the zoos.  The little elephants and the one young girl in the movie makes it, as she is smart and also got her eye on John right off of the bat.  The elephants love her and she ends up with three elephants, and fun in trying to keep them fed, going out with the crew to capture others and not learning until the first trip that she should ride inside.  She even is good at dancing and playing the piano, but best of all, is teaching John how to kiss.  A darned good movie and I would never be without it in my DVD collection.  Thanks Amazon.com for having it on hand.  I purchased it and began watching it and have lent it out to others and they feel the same way.  Loving John Wayne in a whole new character.
He seems younger in this one, had to be to help corale these animals, especially the little monkeys that Red Buttons has a gimmick to capture and earn them alot of money.  Buy it, you will never be sorry and you will save it as I have.

256443,3,6300215954,"This is one of those movies that demonstrates the obvious fact that John Wayne had a lot of fun during his career. And in this one, the audience has a good bit of fun, too.

Wayne plays Sean Mercer, a big game hunter who brings them back alive, selling them to zoos. The opening story has his oldest assistant, the Indian, getting gored by a rhino. The team rushes him to a hospital, some five hours away, and while they are there, a cocky young Frenchman asks for a job, hearing that one of his men has been injured. Then the doctor comes out and says the Indian has AB+ blood, which is pretty hard to find. Turns out Chip, the Frenchman, has AB+.

The team consists of Kurt, a handsome young German, Pockets (Red Buttons), Brandy, the daughter of Sean's old partner who was killed by a rhino, Luis Gomez, who is Mexican, and eventually Chip, the Frenchman.

And then there's Dallas, the girl in Sean's bed when he gets back from the hospital, drunk because they were celebrating that the Indian is going to be OK. Turns out she's a photographer hired by a large Italian zoo, one of Sean's best clients. She's also very pretty (skinny like a model), and it doesn't take long for her to fall for Sean.

When the team goes on a camping trip to gather animals, they come to a village where a game warden has just shot a rogue elephant that was tearing up the village. Turns out the elephant had a baby, and Dallas won't let the game keeper shoot it. They buy a couple dozen goats for milk to feed the baby, and name it Tembo, which means ""elephant"" in the local tribal language. When a second elephant shows up, the tribe hears about it and creates a ceremony to name Dallas ""Mama Tembo"" and an honorary member of their tribe. Eventually a third one shows up.

One of the best things about this movie is ""Baby Elephant Walk,"" a cute song which was a hit back when the movie was new. It's used twice. The first time is when Dallas takes the elephants to the local watering hole because it's hot, and Sean follows her with a rifle and scolds her for not having someone with a rifle go with her. And then a herd of full-size elephants show up and Sean scares them off by shooting over their heads.

The second time we here the theme is when Dallas leaves without giving Sean a chance to ask her to stay, and the team uses Tembo as a tracker to go find her. There's only room for Tembo in the pickup truck, but the other two elephants follow. It's a very funny scene, with the elephants going in and out of buildings following Tembo, who is following Dallas. Of course, she is eventually cornered and Sean persuades her to stay by marrying her.

Fun, light-hearted, and with marvelous animals and beautiful scenery.",1337126400,,2709,4.363095238095238

I grew up with John Wayne movies, & the ""Duke"" was always one of my favorites! They just don't make them like him anymore! Of course, there is a multitude of great westerns that John Wayne made, more than I ever have seen, & probably ever will, but he also made other genre films, some truly great! ""Hatari!' 1962, is one of them.

"" Hatari"" is about African animal trappers that capture animals for zoos around the world. From Rhinos to Monkeys, the ""Duke"" & crew catch them all!

""Hatari!"" is truly a fascinating film, filled with real animals being captured! It is exciting, especially the first Rhino scene that starts off the movie! It is funny, John Wayne & Red Buttons giving classic performances. It is funny, cute! Three baby Elephants adopt a female photographer sent from a Switzerland zoo, to take pictures of the crew catching animals for a photo album. They follow her every where, like huge puppies with no hair, big floppy ears & a trunk, as John Wayne uses them like Bloodhounds to find her in, Arusha, his love interest in the film that tries to leave them all behind because she thinks the ""Duke"" does not want her to stay. A particularly funny scene is when the first baby Elephant adopts her, & they buy a herd of Goats to feed the baby Goat milk. Every time the baby trumpets, the goats go flying everywhere, trying to run away. Then there is John Wayne milking a goat, do I have to say more!

""Hatari!"" is a great film for those that want to see John Wayne play something else other than a cowboy. Though his role is typical ""Duke,"" well, that's why millions loved him & still do. The movie is quite unlike any other I've seen, & the fine cast, cinematography, script, & the directing by the great Howard Hawks, make this an essential John Wayne film!",1321920000,,1806,4.463636363636364

256614,5,6300215954,"With the cast doing up close and personal stunts with African animals, including in the capture sequences, there was more actual danger in this film than most!

In Hatari!, John Wayne leads a group of professional animal capture experts, filling orders for zoos worldwide. Their season of hunting is complicated when one of the group is gored by a rhino, and by a female photographer (Dallas) who shows up. When Dallas begins to accumulate a nursery of baby elephants, things get even more complicated.

A budding romance between Sean (Wayne) and Dallas is by no means overdone, but does provide a few of the many amusing moments in this excellent tale, full of slice of life moments on the African veldt and in the hunters' compound. Such solid acting talent as Red Buttons, Bruce Cabot, and Hardy Kruger help fill a delightful cast which operates with perfect chemistry.

Listen closely as the cast prods and pushes a zebra into a capture crate. You'll hear John Wayne say ""Get him the hell in there!"" While common even in family hour programming for decades now, you didn't hear even ""hell"" and ""damn"" in much movie dialog in 1962! LOL

Another treat is the rocket shot to capture monkeys.

256616,4,6300215954,"The pictured PARAMOUNT VHS of HATARI! (illustration of Duke Wayne and rifle) is from 1989. It has a sharp full screen picture with HiFi mono sound. The tape I purchased here 8/10 plays flawlessly.

HATARI! (1962) is a gorgeous Technicolor adventure set in old Tanganiyka, the sort of movie that, because of modern restrictions against animal abuse, will never be made again. Scenes here of catching alive a stampeding wildebeast, giraffe and rhino are not simulations. Men using jeeps and trucks race alongside terrorized galloping animals and skillfully slip ropes around their necks. It's a most impressive thing to see, if somewhat cruel.

Injuries are common to this line of endeavor. In the opening hunt sequence, Bruce Cabot (as 'Indian') is horned in the thigh by an enraged rhino. He nearly bleeds to death during a five hour trip to the nearest hospital and is left permanently disabled by the wound.

Weakest element is the romantic pairing of 27-year-old Elsa Martinelli with Sean Mercer (Wayne), a man twice her age. As with most Hollywood scripts of that era, their union, however unlikely, is inevitable. Here, the Italian fashion model is 'Dallas,' a photographer newly arrived from a Swiss zoo whose purpose is to take snaps of critters being snagged on the hoof. To do so, she must bump along the dusty African plains with Sean and crew.

The greenhorn in their midst quickly becomes a seasoned safari vet. Her adoption against Sean's wishes of an orphaned infant elephant soon brings two more into their compound. Dallas leading her ""babies"" to a nearby watering hole provides a golden opportunity for one of Hank Mancini's most renowned tunes,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baby-Elephant-Walk/dp/B0000248VB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Baby Elephant Walk.""</a>

In another example of cradle robbing, 49-year-old Red Buttons (as comic sidekick 'Pockets') has the hots for Brandy (Michle Girardon), a gal half his age. When Pockets tumbles from a fence, Brandy's overly-solicitous concern is evidence that the feeling is mutual.

Rightly nominated for a cinematography Oscar, action sequences in this exotic Howard Hawks dramedy more than make up for its curious May/September romance interruptions. Main cast includes Hardy Krger, Grard Blain and Valentin de Vargas.",1281571200,3,2328,5.507002801120448

Set in Tanganyika, now known as Tanzania in east Africa, Sean Mercer (John Wayne) stars as part of a team of big game hunter who capture animals for shipment to zoos around the world.

While probably not known to the average movie watcher, Hatari! is famous, not for the movie, but for a well known tune ""Baby Elephant Walk"", by Henry Mancini.

256667,5,6300215954,"""Hatari!"" has long been a personal favorite for its adventure, excitement, thrills, laughs, cinematography, sound track, and overall entertainment.  ""Hatari!"" was the first movie I ever went to see more than once; I wore out two sound track records listening to Henry Mancini's marvelous music; and the film was the first VHS I ever purchased.  As my tapes were starting to go bad, I finally purchased the DVD.  I was quite relieved that all 157 minutes are on one disc, and in wide screen.  (How I long for more movies that dare to defy the establishment and release films that take their time to evolve).  Having just watched it, I felt compelled to write a review for this epic movie.

""Hatari!"" (which means ""danger"" in Swahili) is in some ways a ""modern"" day western: jeeps and trucks have replaced the horse, but the ""cowboys"" are still using ropes to capture (or round up) the animals to take to ""market"" (the zoo, in this case).  But ""Hatari!"" is also a bit of a documentary (and lampoons this through Elsa Martinelli's character Anna Maria 'Dallas' D'Allesandro, who is there to photographically ""document"" the catching of the animals).  And it is very good; albeit the portrayal of the local native populations and the attitudes of the non-Africans are aloof and condescending (a ""portrait of Africa still dominated by non-Africans"").

True to nearly all of John Wayne's movies, the actor did nearly all of the scenes himself--for which much of the audio had to be re-dubbed due to John Wayne's cursing while wrestling with the animals--which inspired the other actors to be fully involved as well:

""According to director Howard Hawks, all the animal captures in the picture were performed by the actual actors; no stunt men or animal handlers were substituted on screen. The rhino really did escape, and the actors really did have to recapture it--and Hawks included the sequence for its realism."" (IMDb)

""Hatari!"" utilized an international cast (unlike many westerns that really should also have multiple nationalities representing the ""cowboys""), reflective of the types of people that actually worked in the ""business"" at that time.  ""Hatari!"" gathers its several characters (roles) from different parts of the world: ""Sean Mercer (John Wayne), Anna Maria 'Dallas' D'Allesandro (Elsa Martinelli), Kurt Mueller (Hardy Krger), Brandy De la Court (Michele Girardon), Charles 'Chips' Maurey (Gerard Blain), Luis Francisco Garcia Lopez (Valentin De Vargas) are, respectively, from USA, Italy, Germany, France, France and Mexico (Wikipedia).""  Through this cast, as well as the use of locals (stereotyped or not), ""Hatari!"" rings out the excitement of the chase, the comradely interpersonal relationships, and the wonderful world of animals. (According to IMDb, ""Jan Oelofse, the animal supervisor, captured and tamed all the animals in Africa; the elephants, leopard, the cheetahs, and flew with 40 animals aboard a DC6 across Africa, through South America to Hollywood to continue scenes shot in Hollywood).  As with many other ""less popular"" movies, John Wayne exhibits an unexpected ability to keep up with the comedy in the film.

Indeed, in the final analysis, ""Hatari!"" is about the animals; first and foremost.  As such, it is a wonderful movie for the whole family (the only real ""violence"" is when ""the Indian"" is slightly ""gored"" in the leg by a rhino at the beginning of the film).  I introduced my sons to John Wayne with my favorite, ""Stagecoach,"" but they were less than thrilled, being in black and white.  So, I showed them ""McLintock!"" (See my review of the later for more comments on this), and they were sold.  They then chose ""Hatari!"" to watch, and it remains their favorite John Wayne movie.  I have since loaned ""Hatari!"" to others with children, and unanimously, they have all enjoyed it.  And why not?  John Wayne, baby elephants, wondering cheetahs, feisty ostriches, towering giraffes, stampeding animals and lots of laughs, all in one movie!  (And don't forget the great musical score!).

Hardy Krueger (Flight of the Phoenix) is here also as a more than credible assistant. Elsa Martinelli is the female lead but is weak in her portrayal.

This is about where Wayne began his dabbling with international casts, male & female. In general these casts were weak which only served to make the Duke look better. The film director is Howard Hawks, whom Wayne had worked with before on numerous occasions, so the film is in very capable hands. In this movie we get actilon, comedy & drama. The scenery is great.

256683,5,6300215954,"Well, a LOT of people would argue with my heading on this one and they'd probably be right -- but it's MY favorite John Wayne film. *.*

Here, a (non-cowboy) John Wayne earns his living in Africa rounding up wild critters (often at the risk of human life) for zoos. The film is all about the close-knit team who carries out this now-dubious endeavor. A beautiful lady photographer throws a monkey wrench into the works when Wayne is forced to take her along during his expeditions.

What do I love about the film?

The cinematography is simply incredible... none of the wild animal footage looks at all hokey like it does in so many other African-adventure films. The color saturation is just great and the scenery is spectacular.

The movie is bulging with cool old vehicles and other nostalgic impedimenta that one loves to see in this genre.

My favorite aspect of this flick is the filmscore, composed and rendered by whom? Henry Mancini, the old Master. Most of the background music is contemporary to the early 60s themes that one might hear from Alex North (""Cleopatra"") or from Les Baxter (""Voodoo Island""). Wonderful stuff!

The casting is near-perfect and I suppose they had to include Red Buttons in this one, who plays a character named ""Pockets"" -- to me, he's the one hokey facet of the production although I cannot argue that many folks love him in this, and many other movies as well.

256687,5,6300215954,"Hatari is one of those unexpected pleasures you find on basic cable. I first saw this movie on a local channel one Saturday afternoon. I only watched because it had the Duke in it. What I took from the movie was a fast-paced adventure which didn't minimize toughness, but didn't emphasize violence. A great deal of adeventure movies features violence and gore, not just plain, sturdy toughness. This movie features manly toughness without any embellishment or crudeness. Just a bunch of confident guys getting a tough job done without complaint. The plot is light, but not far fetched. The plot focuses simply on people doing their job (a job that is enjoyable) while interacting with one another. The movie doesn't need to go further than that because it is entertaining and enjoyable. Bit of trivia - Wayne and the others caught the animals themselves. Look at Wayne's mouth during the catch sequences; they are obviously dubbed over because Wayne cursed too much at the animals.  Anyway watch this movie, it's a real treat!!!!",1181174400,2,1029,4.9479768786127165
256688,3,6300215954,"Hatari! is Howard Hawks at his most laid back. Thankfully not as shrill and manic as his Thirties screwball comedies, this veers totally in the opposite direction with its ambling, almost low-key and virtually plotless look at a group of animal catchers in East Africa who embody all the usual Hawksian stereotypes - likeably gruff but not humourless hero (Wayne), quiet punk kid who makes good (Gerard Blain), professional sidekick (Hardy Kruger), obligatory comic relief (Red Buttons) and game gal (Elsa Martinelliu). It in no way justifies its 157-minute running time, but all the reason Hawks needs is that he likes these people and wants to spend more time with them. Gently entertaining, but at times a little too laid back.

256689,4,6300215954,"Hatari means danger in Swahili. And so it is. A group of animal-catchers, operating from fast-moving trucks, capture wild animals using rope (no tranquilizers!). The animals frequently attack the trucks, for which the trucks are protected with old tires mounted on their sides. Attempts to corral a rhino lead to one of the men being severely gored. A tourniquet does not stem the loss of blood, and the man is near death. In the end, it takes a blood transfusion to save the man's life, followed by days of recovery.

There are scenes showing the capture of giraffes, wildebeest, and other animals. Natives help in the roundup of escaped ostriches. A woman raises one, two, and then three unweaned baby elephants. These are fed goats' milk, which turns out to be not so simple to get from the goats! In time, the woman leaves the group unannounced, and attempts to return to Europe. Her baby elephants sniff her out when she doesn't want to be found, enabling the others to locate her.

Throughout this flick, John Wayne is his typical self.  He engages in blustery talk to others, including women. Diplomacy is not exactly his forte--but then who would expect the Duke to be diplomatic? And, as one would expect in a western, there are fistfights.

There are funny scenes in the film as well, as when a man builds rockets to be fired in order to scare monkeys into going up a tree.

Then Elsa Martinelli comes to the camp(they thinks she is a guy because she signed her name with initials)and she starts taking the pictures, Then somehow she is adopted by and becomes the mother of four or five baby elephants who have lost their own Moms. she feeds, and waters them to keep them wet and happy.

256726,5,6300215954,"There are at least four `African' films from the 50s and 60s that I've been enchanted with since I first saw them many years ago: King Solomon's Mines, with Deborah Kerr and Stewart Granger; The Naked Prey, with Cornel Wilde; most certainly Zulu, the entry by the youngish Michael Caine; and Hatari!, the John Wayne/African Travelogue vehicle par excellence from Howard Hawks.

John Wayne is going to be John Wayne, regardless of the film in which you find him; his range is not all that flexible. The quality any particular Wayne film is to be determined not only by allowing for his particular personality but by the quality of the script, and the skill and insight of the director. In Hartari! We have such an excellent combination.

The film is a bit dated (almost 45 years old at this writing!) but it wears well. We get an eclectic international cast. We see lots of African animals. We have battered Dodge and Mercedes trucks. We encounter various tribes of African Peoples. We're invited to enjoy some beautiful photography of an absolutely gorgeous country, including a shot or two of Mt Kilimanjaro.

It is incredible that these actors did most of the action sequences in capturing the animals. It is obvious that there was legitimate danger involved.

If I have any complaints at all, they're very minor. Pockets (Red Buttons) is a little overdone for my tastes, by about 12%. If we could reduce his antics by that amount and increase the screen time and dialogue from Brandy (Michele Girardon) proportionally, I believe the balance would be better for it. Besides, I prefer her shade of red hair.

I would like to have heard a little more from the Spaniard (Valentin de Vargas). And Dallas (Elsa Martinelli), once introduced as a sponsoring zoo's staff photographer, doesn't seem to be shooting too many pictures. The only other bit of nit-picking I have is that there is too much smoking: probably Camel Straights. I think everybody chain-smoked back then.

The Mancini Score, though considered somewhat quaint now, was thoughtfully considered and quite innovative for the time. I still enjoy the thematic jazz elements in the dancing sequences, the Great Ostrich Escape and, of course, the antics of the Baby Elephants.

This movie is an excellent choice for Family Movie Night - even the ninth time around. Five Stars, please.

Wayne is John Wayne, so he's just what you expect; Red Buttons does his usual sidekick comic relief shtick; Elsa Martinelli and Michele Girardon add European spice; Hardy Kruger as the German hunk and Gerard Blain as the French fellow are appropriately antagonistic/buddy roles; and Bruce Cabot is a sturdy support as the ""Indian"".

of taking you there. If you study this movie there are several

interesting irregularities through out that do not detract from

the show but would make for fascinating interviews with the few

interesting stories behind all of that. Hatari is a perfect

There is plenty of wild animal action (the actors really did catch the animals), fun, and innocent romance, too. John Wayne has one of his best roles as the rugged he-man who acts all dopey around a pretty girl. German heartthrob Hardy Kruger is the reason I watch this movie over and over again.  Miss Martinelli is very good as the Italian beauty who falls for Sean and is the object of two baby elephants' affections, as well.

Yes, yes, yes, and yes. Hyena bathing and slapstick elephant chases? But of course. Shape-shifting space aliens? Okay, it doesn't have that, but it has everything else and a cast that works well together and isn't overscripted.
The story follows a season in the lives of a team of big game hunters (a catch-and-release group that works for zoos and circuses). A couple outsiders come in and the group dynamic changes; the young girl of the group is suddenly all grown up and a love triangle (later a quadrangle) forms and resolves itself; the group's leader has to choose between letting go of the past or missing the relationship of a lifetime; and then there's the horrible rhino curse that must be broken. In lesser hands, it would all be a ""very special episode"" of Little House on the Savanna, but Howard Hawks masterfully directs his cast and winds up with some incredible footage of the African plains and its wildlife as well. Add in an excellent score by Henry Mancini, and you are really drawn into the action; the whimsical ""Baby Elephant Walk"" provides a nice break from the tension - you know nothing bad can happen once the calliope starts up, so just sit back and enjoy the fun.
John Wayne keeps his swagger and drawl mostly in check, but Buttons' physical comedy is a little overeager. Still, the remaining 98% of the film is on target in tone and balance. The scenes between lovelorn Martinelli and Buttons feel genuine, the animal herding and capture scenes feel dangerous, the rhino goring and dislocated shoulder repair feel painful, and your arteries begin to clog at the mention of codfish cakes deep-fried in antelope fat.
This is a great movie to lose yourself in. Just make sure you have a full two-and-a-half hours to spend; once you begin you won't want the action, romance, and comedy to stop for even a minute.",1074988800,34,2001,4.802898550724637
256749,1,6300215954,"The name of the movie almost sounds ""African"". This is one of John Wayne's `travelogue movies' as I have come to call them.
The movies basically stink yet they have several ingredients common to the script which makes them easily identifiable. First they are shot on location, Africa, Hawaii, at the circus or to the backdrop of some unusual profession as in Hellfighters.
Second, and this never fails, Duke is always much larger than other men in the cast and also much older. In the case of Red Buttons, nicknamed `Pockets' in this movie, and Hardy Krueger, the short German method actor, Duke appears almost menacing with his enormous size compared to the other actors and threatening repartee. The sperm count of the cast must have been microscopic.
The third ingredient is that Duke had lung cancer and was diagnosed in 1963 during the filming of The Sons of Katie Elder. So in movies like Hitari, and Donovan's Reef, he was still turning the girls on with cigarette breath and using Camels as sexual paraphernalia.
The fourth ingredient is what I call `zany nonsense'. There is always some kind of idiotic chase scene comic relief thing going. In the case of Hitari, Duke loads a baby elephant in the back of a jeep and then rides off like a maniac terrifying the animal all in the attempt to chase down an Italian model turned actress named `Dallas' as she was trying to get the heck away from Duke and his absurd missed love cues. If Duke was the prize bull amongst all of the midget male actors, he sure came off as brain damaged. His shaving cream kiss with Dallas looked more like State's evidence than affection.
The last ingredient is the `show you how it's done' thing. Some portion of these movies is always dedicated to some mandatory action footage about how to do whatever it is that Duke is supposed to be an expert doing. It is just filler to hide the lack of plot. For example in Hellfighters, it was putting out oil fires, in Hatari there is the usual obligatory action scene featuring Duke wrestling what could only be a drug induced Rhino into submission with the help of friendly African Natives and lots of rope. Animal rights activists might find these scenes appalling however movie critics would find the entire film appalling. One star is quite generous",1074038400,9,2283,4.681592039800995
256809,5,6300215954,"HATARI! may be the most enjoyable of the Howard Hawks/John Wayne collaborations (their other pairings produced the classics RED RIVER and RIO BRAVO, and the RIO BRAVO 'remakes' EL DORADO and RIO LOBO), and is exceptional in several ways; at 157 minutes (2 hours, 37 minutes), it may be one of the longest 'buddy' films ever made; nearly all of the animal 'chase and capture' sequences involved the actual cast members (professional handlers serving as stunt doubles were only rarely used); and the filming began with virtually no script (which was written based on the 'on location' footage in Africa, after the cast returned to California). At 65, director Hawks was still in top form, and the risks he took paid off...HATARI!, despite it's length, is never boring!

The story focuses on a season with a team of professional hunter/trappers, capturing animals for zoos and circuses. With a breathtaking opening scene of a rhino chase, costing them the use of veteran driver, 'Indian' (legendary actor Bruce Cabot), the 'family' dynamic is quickly established, with rugged Sean Mercer (Wayne) both boss and father-figure to the group. As he and the rest of the 'family' (Red Buttons, Hardy Krger, Valentin de Vargas, and Michle Girardon) meet 'Indian's' replacement, 'Chips' (Grard Blain), Mercer has an even bigger headache to deal with; beautiful photographer Anna Maria 'Dallas' D'Allesandro (Elsa Martinelli) has arrived, to shoot a magazine spread. A 'traditional' Hawks leading lady, 'Dallas' is feisty, sultry, and attracted to Mercer, and the older man, uncomfortable with the ease by which she fits into the group, as well as his own stirrings, tries to make it clear that romance has no place on his agenda (in much the same manner as he did with Angie Dickinson in RIO BRAVO...and with the same results).

While some elements of the story are dated and politically incorrect (shooting a baby African elephant, even as a 'mercy killing', would be a major offense, today, as it is an endangered species), the combination of spectacular 'hunt' sequences, and the warmth and easy camaraderie of the cast in the subplots make HATARI! a rich, rewarding experience.

A major plus for the film is a very atypical Henry Mancini score, combining tense, African-influenced themes for the chases, and the very funny 'Baby Elephant Walk' to punctuate 'Dallas's' relationship with her adopted pachyderm 'children'. The baby elephant scenes are film highlights, as is the rocket capture of a tree filled with monkeys, and both rhino chases (which clearly shows Wayne in some real danger!)

From the opening rhino sequence to the closing 'Honeymoon' scene, HATARI! is a grand entertainment, and escapism at it's best!",1070496000,96,2712,5.142857142857143

256813,4,6300215954,"A big highlight of most of the vacations our family has taken over the years have been to zoos.  Though the PETA people may not agree, to enjoy these zoos one has to accept that people need to catch these animals in the wild to make it work.  While breeding in the zoos does help, there still needs to be a fresh supply from the wild.
While the plot is fairly standard, the reason I titled this ""one of a kind"" refers to the type of work that is done.  This is about the people who catch animals for circuses and zoos.  It was shot forty years ago, and while the politics of the time are a bit different, the action of the movie is terrifically exciting throughout.
These were the days long before computer-enchanced graphics, which would have been used had the movie been done today.  No, these are real wild animals.  Since I doubt that the animals used can be trained for this type of work, I have to conclude that the footage is real, and that real wild animals that didn't want to be caught were used.
So we get scenes involving giraffes, zebras, rhinos, and one or two kinds I'm not able to identify.  We also get to see genuine interraction with baby elephants, a cheetah, and even a hyena.  With all the animals, it works great both as a family film which can also be viewed at an adult level.
The adult level takes a bit away from a higher rating of what is still a very fine film.  It seems that EVERYONE smokes ALL THE TIME, at least when they're not getting plastered drunk.  The occasional fighting stunts are not done well, and some of the dubbing could have been done better.  And with all the action with the animals, it really didn't need a love story, but the movie seems to think it was important to hook up the only females in the cast.
But these are minor, and yes, it was a different time.  But I will close by saying that every zoo I've been to seems deadly serious about treating their animals like the treasures they are.  And it is a fact that animals in zoos generally live far longer than in the wild (and a lot safer, too).  So while I'll admit there are probably unscrupulous people in this line of work, if we are to enjoy zoos, this type of work is necessary, as are the people who do it.

They carry guns -- but they don't shoot anything; they smoke and drink to excess and eat lots of fatty foods (crab cakes fried in antelope fat!); they drive old beat-up jeeps and land rovers and they don't wear seatbelts -- and when they roll a jeep they pick everybody up and dust them off instead of calling a doctor (or a lawyer); the men are dumb and tough and lovable and honest and the women are smart and competent and sexy and honest -- and they don't have to prove anything to anybody.
 There's no way you could make this movie now. These guys lasso real animals -- giraffes and rhinos and zebras -- and wrestle them to the ground and put them in cages. The animals were probably not amused. But Hatari was politically correct in its day. Wayne's team includes a German, a Frenchman, an American Indian, a Spaniard, and an Italian femme fatale and they all get along pretty well. The Africans in the movie are called boys and there's not a hint that they might prefer to be called something else, like Mr. or Sir.

The scenery is marvelous, the photography fabulous, the music cute, the comedy stupid, the love scenes corny, and the animal capture scenes are fascinating. So this is how zoos get their animals....
Hatari is an idealized Africa of Bwanas and boys. Today, I suppose we're safer, happier, healthier, etc., but living in the shadow of Kilimanjaro and chasing animals around sure looks like a lot of fun.",1029369600,41,1639,4.441860465116279

256817,5,6300215954,"Okay - so the movie is about catching animals in Africa for zoo delivery - well where do you think the zoos get all those lovely animals? Do you think they just waltz into their cages with engraved invitations? Heck no, they don't. This movie retains it's classic appeal as an adventure and a bit of a love story thrown in as well. But let's face it - you can't impose today's politically correct environment on a classic old movie. It just doesn't work. For the time period when this movie was created - all the characters are true to form. The men are alpha males doing a tough seasonal job in Africa, but they also have tender and funny sides to their characters. The women are fiesty, smart, and well drawn. (The ladies are NOT jiggle and giggle girls). This movie has adventure, humor, great scenery, good action, and offers a glimpse into a different kind of world - a time when animals roamed in huge herds in Africa. Highly recommended movie for the person who loves classic older movies, and can appreciate the movie for what it is without imposing modern views onto the story or characters. I love this movie, and I have no trouble watching it over again. Very enjoyable.",1023408000,,1181,4.5233644859813085

The comedy is great, scenery amazing and it is one of those calssic stories taht you just don't get tired of.  I hope to share this gem with  my kids and promise that no one buying this video will be disappointed.",1016409600,,363,4.0

I usually like John Wayne movies, and I bought Hatari! because I thought I remembered watching it as a kid.  I'm certain I did see it, but my positive memories were some sort of temporary mental abberation--and I didn't see the whole thing.
I'm definitely not an ""animal-rights activist"" (mmmm, beef), but watching this movie makes me want to contribute to PETA or Sierra Club or something; it's a real shame to see people chasing after animals in jeeps.  The humor is tired and worn, and I don't think I've seen so much smoking in a movie since The Towering Inferno. (It appears to me the movie's been sponsored by the tobacco and African safari companies.)
On a moral scale, I'll give the movie 5 points for saving baby elephants and a big -500 for the various jeep-chasing scenes...no point in mentioning the poor monkeys.
I'd have a hard time recommending this one.  It's slightly better than Donovan's Reef, but only because of the goofy rocket bit and the music.  There are many better John Wayne films, and tons of better movies in general.",1010620800,7,1073,4.661375661375661
256830,5,6300215954,"Does anyone not like this movie?  This and Red River are tied as my favorite John Wayne films.  The scenery and cinematography are simply spectacular, and it's a joy to finally see it in wide-screen.  There isn't a dull moment in Hatari!, and while the subject matter (catching wild animals for zoos) may be ""politically incorrect"" by todays thinking, it's a terrific film for the whole family.",1002067200,2,394,4.850746268656716
256831,5,6300215954,"This was one of the first movies to combine the majesty of Africa with a amusing plot and compelling Mancini music score. The Duke plays it true to type but it is director Howard Hawks' wonderful use of Africa's natural beauty and its animals that elevates this above the usual Wayne fare.  Groundbreaking moviemaking it is not, but for sheer G-rated enjoyment and some truly memorable scenes/music it is hard to top. According to Hawks the actors actually captured the animals themselves (no stunt doubles) and there is little reason to doubt him since this was way before the computer effects seen in Forrest Gump.  The mark of a great movie is that it is timeless. Unless you knew the Duke's bio intimately you could not tell what decade it was shot.  Stunning visuals, a crisp tongue-in-cheek script, a chart-topping song (true--Baby Elephant Walk), and the Duke poking a little fun at himself, Hatari! is a movie that does not take itself too seriously but still delivers the goods many times over.  I've seen it 50 times since it first came out and am always a little sad at the end that it ended. They don't make them that way any more.  This is a movie you can enjoy with the family or can leave in the hands of a baby sitter and not worry that your kids. Highest possible ""fun"" rating. In its own way as good as anything the Duke did. Watch it again and listen to how versatile Mancini's score is. Still my all-time favorite movie.",998179200,2,1440,4.544401544401544
256832,5,6300215954,"Hatari has a familiar plot but it is a wonderful movie. John Wayne is one of the greatest Hollywood actors of all time and his performance although predictable is funny and good. He's getting a little old for the maidens (and it shows in this movie) but nobody from Redford to Grant can kiss a woman like the Duke.
The outdoor scenes are gorgeous. Not much extra on the DVD, but the clarity of picture and wide screen make this a worthy purchase.",997056000,2,446,4.385542168674699
256833,4,6300215954,"Mr. Wayne takes command of the screen, and the story line without making excuses for doing so. He manages to to be large and incharge, but still shows that doesn't mean beating up the current ""enemy of the state"",(USofA). The film has great images of a land that is fading, and was wonderful on the big screen. Howard Hawkes knew how to get a geat ""Duke"" performance on screen This DVD is going to replace a very worn VHS..... How about ""Hellfighters"" next?",996364800,,457,4.518072289156627
256834,4,6300215954,"""Hatari"" is the film of my childhood.  I grew up as a Marine's kid in the late 50's through the 60's, living primarily at Cherry Point USMC airbase (Havelock) NC. The town was so small then that we had to go to the base cinema which would, of course, show every John Wayne movie over and over again.  This was the only one I would ask to go see.  Violence and ""ugly Americanism"" are at a minimum for a JW movie. However, since the live capture of wild animals can be pretty intense, I wouldn't recommend it for pre-schoolers or very sensitive children.  I gave it 4 stars because there is minimal technical information and I want to see the quality of the DVD transfer before I commit.  This is definitely worth a rental.",991872000,,721,4.350746268656716

I hope Paramount is making a DVD in the near future, cause my old VHS tape is pretty worn out and won't do it any longer. Although John Wayne is mostly famous for his western movies, he's best in Non-westerns. His exprssion when Martinelli asks him how he likes to kiss is priceless. I LOVE IT!! Howard Hawks was an excellent director and never in the 160 minutes the movie is boring. The action scenes are exciting, the comedy scenes are funny. Don't touch it when you love Stallone or Van Damme, but it is a must when you love Good Old Hollywood!!",986428800,41,665,4.203125
256836,5,6300215954,"Take John Wayne off his horse and put him on the front of a pickup truck, and it's off to the races in this classic film about a group of professional big game hunters in Africa. Wonderful combination of action, comedy and the cast of characters reacting to each other as the storyline develops. The Duke is the undisputed leader of this group of international stars, who are plainly shown to be doing the capture scenes themselves. That adds so much to the film by not using stunt doubles. This is evident in the last capture scene of the rhino as Wayne is plainly shown trying to untangle ropes and move the trapped beast. He stands just mere inches from the horn of the rhino when the beast begins bucking and snorting!  Think about this also. Wayne was on the front of the truck doing the capture scenes. That truck could have easily turned over, and the Duke would have been dead 17 years before his time. Raw courage and devotion to his trade! A must see movie for the entire family!",970012800,2,989,4.434065934065934

As someone who is not usually a big John Wayne  fan, I enjoy seeing him in a role that doesn't stray far from his persona  but gives him a lightness that is seldom seen in his traditional films.  We're still waiting for this to be released on DVD - Henry Mancini's  soundtrack would be wonderful!",967334400,,395,4.3561643835616435
