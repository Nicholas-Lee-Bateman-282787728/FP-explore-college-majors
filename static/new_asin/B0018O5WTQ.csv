3417865,5,B0018O5WTQ,I was really upset about the season/volume presentation and waited what seemed like forever to buy the total first season. It stood up really well over the years and I was glad I broke down. I still don't appreciate the way the distributors are releasing shows. For example twenty-five dollars($25) for one volume of five(5) in the set equals ($125) and one year later fifty dollars($50) for the entire boxed set.,1226793600,,413,4.830985915492958
3417866,5,B0018O5WTQ,"The only regret I have of this DVD is the fact that Paramount is cheapening out by releasing them as volumes, instead of seasons to try to make it appear less expensive. It's 1977 all over again and after 31 years I still get sucked into this program! The cavalcade of Hollywood has-beens from the past make up the passenger manifest in this second volume! We have Michelle Lee who wound up living on this program along with Desi Arnez Jr. Is it cheesy? Yes! But who cares! I would also watch this show as a kid every Saturday night and it always felt like I was going along with them. In fact, I would even get a little down when the final night of the cruise segment was on because that meant the episode was coming to an end. This is Television at its best! You can't go wrong with this one!",1221609600,3,794,4.196078431372549

3417868,5,B0018O5WTQ,I grew up with the Love Boat. It is one of my favorites. All of the series are awesome and it brings back great memories,1220918400,,120,3.84
3417869,5,B0018O5WTQ,"I enjoyed season 1 volume 1 and I enjoyed volume 2 as well.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that are disappointed that the complete season was not offered, however, I have been waiting for too long for this series to be released on dvd to protest buying it.  The show is just as I remembered, cute, a little corny, and a lot of fun to watch.  I can't wait until more seasons are released.",1220745600,10,398,4.142857142857143

3417873,5,B0018O5WTQ,"At last vol II is announced and the 13 remaining episodes of season 1 will be included here together with the third love boat tv movie which aired in may 1977 but actually is the pilot tv movie for it was the first love boat movie which all the original cast were present.
 According to [...] this movie will be included as a bonus in this dvd set so if this is true that's great news and we may get also the other movies in future love boat dvd releases as bonus",1210377600,17,463,4.032608695652174
3417874,4,B0018O5WTQ,"Following the format of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-American-Style/dp/B0011NVC9S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love American Style</a>&nbsp;(1969), ABC's ""The Love Boat"" (1977-1986) featured guest stars in comedy vignettes about love and romance. Unlike Love American Style, the stories were intertwined rather than telecast consecutively, featuring the guest stars along with a regular cast. Namely, the crew of the Pacific Princess. Starring as the ship's crew were Gavin MacLeod (The Mary Tyler Moore Show) as Captain Merrill Stubing; Bernie Kopell (Get Smart) as ""Doc"" Adam Bricker, Fred Grandy as Yeoman Purser Burl ""Gopher"" Smith; Ted Lange (That's My Mama) as bartender Isaac Washington; and Lauren Tewes as cruise director Julie McCoy. One of the most popular new shows of the 1977-78 season, The Love Boat received an extra boost in ratings when it was paired with similar hit series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantasy-Island/dp/B000B8IA3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantasy Island</a>&nbsp;the following season. From the lyrics (""Come aboard, we're expecting you"") in the theme song performed by Jack Jones to the personalized opening cast credits (""Starring your Love Boat crew...""), the show purposely gave the impression that you (the viewer) were taking the cruises.

It was good to see the show finally come to DVD with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Love-Boat-Season-One-Volume-One/dp/B000Z6GT18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Love Boat - Season One, Volume One</a>&nbsp;which featured decent video and audio. Complete the first season with The Love Boat - Season One, Volume Two. This 4-disc set features the show's remaining 12 hour-long Season One episodes; Full Frame (1.33:1) video; English, Spanish mono audio; Closed Captioning; English, Spanish subtitles; plus the following guest stars: Bob Crane, Kathy Bates, Robert Hays, Pearl Bailey, Don Adams, Adrienne Barbeau, Desi Arnaz Jr., Stephanie Zimbalist, Scatman Crothers, Vicki Lawrence, Jim Backus, Barbi Benton, Monty Hall, real-life sisters Audrey Meadows and Jayne Meadows, Leslie Nielson, TV's ""Brady Bunch"" sisters Maureen McCormick and Eve Plumb, Morey Amsterdam, Annette Funicello, Antonio Fargas, Georgia Engel, Robert Mandan, Shelley Long and many more!

Also included in this set as an EXTRA is the following Special Feature: ""The New Love Boat"" (1977). Following several casting missteps in two earlier films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Love-Boat/dp/B0006M1XI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Love Boat</a>&nbsp;and ""The Love Boat II""), this third pilot film (originally telecast May 5, 1977) finally got it right with the TV series' regular characters Gavin McLeod, Bernie Kopell, Fred Grandy, Ted Lange and Lauren Tewes as the Love Boat crew. Guest stars for this made-for-TV movie include Georgia Engel as a stowaway, Gary Frank and Melanie Mayron as a pair of tremulous honeymooners, Stella Stevens and Pat Harrington as an eternally bickering married couple, and Audra Lindley and Phil Silvers as, respectively, an outspoken middle-aged lady and a woebegone widower. Running time is 74 minutes. Here are the episodes contained in this volume, plus original airdates:

3417881,5,B0018O5WTQ,"My public library had the other three volumes from the first two seasons, but this one was lost, so I bought it, watched it, and now will donate it so that 19 counties of people in SC can enjoy it, too.

This particular volume contains the PILOT and the second half of season one, so we get to see how the captain happened to become the captain of the Pacific Princess, hear him tell the crew to never allow him to hear them call the ship ""The Love Boat"", then in the next episode, hear him call it that himself.

Each weekly episode usually contains three story lines, one more romantic, one more comedic, and one focused on a particular member of the crew. The stories are delightful, and fun to hear, watch and enjoy.

I look forward to when we can get more seasons of The Love Boat.

I highly recommend this TV series.

Well, first of all, The Love Boat isn't going to win any Emmys. And it didn't. But it's good, fairly wholesome, and silly sappy fun.

So about two weeks after that I called Amazon.com and a very lengthly wait on hold and transfered SEVERAL TIMES the persons response was and I quote ""Oh well, that's not our fault"" end quote. There is at least a dozen or more things I would desperately like to buy from amazon.com but I am too afraid of throwing good money after bad since I never recieved the first and only thing I ever bought from you. I have not purchased anything  from you because I am too afraid I won't get it which, in case you are interested means you have lost at least $500 to $1000 in Christmas purchases I bought somewhere else because of lack of confidence in your ability to deliver. At this moment you have a Grady Nutt tape or CD titled ""A laugh and a half"" that I would love to have and you have it at a fair price but what good does it do me to buy it if I never receive it. Also I was in the market for Hogan's Heroes season 5 but bought it somewhere else.

3417905,5,B0018O5WTQ,"For the better part of a decade, the whole world got a weekly dose of Americas version of 'free love' adrift in international waters.  That may sound like a sarcastic joke to today's much more cynical generation but I assure you of my sincerity.  It is hard for anyone under 25 to imagine but there was a time the actual word ""Sex"" was considered shamefull and the very idea of a promiscuous liberated female character was as shockingly fresh as Lady Gaga often tries to be.  LONG before the Internet brought us dating sites and anyone actually took sexual harrasment seriously.  There were about two mainstream ways for like minded singles to 'hook-up'.  Vacations or bars.  This show combined drinking and touring into an hour long satire that not only made ratings history, but also answered the then popular riddle...  ""When a married couple finally runs out of things to talk about, is a divorce really more practical than spending a fortune to go to Mexico and suffer a week of infidelity temptation.""  In conclusion.  This show is not for everyone...anymore.  I would say Baby Boomers and some Gen. X-ers.  The modern day audience is either going to be too jaded or simply find the hairstyles and fasion wrecks mildly novel.  Happily, i'm 40 and enjoy laughing at well writting scripts as well as bell bottoms, mutant afros and tomboys with girl next door looks and charm.

3417932,5,B0018O5WTQ,"The Pacific Princess will help you escape reality for an hour with laughter and romance. Sail back to the late 1970's where the colors are vibrant and the atmosphere is fun and light. It's the perfect vacation.

Captain Stubing, Doc, Julie, Isaac and Gopher continue as the regulars who are the glue for the passengers in several storylines within each episode. The stories are light and airy, sometimes goofy, sometimes romantic, and you are guaranteed to walk away with a smile or a laugh.

The guest stars are from T.V. and film - it's a good mix of nostalgia.  Look for: Kathy Bates (long before she was an Oscar winner), Rosemary DeCamp, Don Adams, Fernando Lamas, Michele Lee, Vicki Lawrence, Maureen McCormick, Marion Ross, Frankie Avalon, Patty Duke, Audrey Meadows, Leslie Nielsen, Janis Paige and many more.

In the second part of this first season, they start to get more creative with activities and parties. There's a masquerade ball, a beauty pageant, a Valentine celebration and a lot more dancing in the ship's lounge.

Twelve, hour-long episodes are offered. The quality and color are great. Special features: promos and a movie of the week from 1977: ""The New Love Boat."" This is a lot of fun. We get to see how Captain Stubing was introduced to the rest of the crew. It's interesting to see that Julie was a bit more sophisticated here than in the series. It features: Georgia Engel, Stella Stevens, Audra Lindley, Phil Silvers, Gary Frank and more.

I highly recommend this for anyone who loves to see the parade of stars on the show or if you just want to end your day with a smile. ""The Love Boat"" will cruise you right into a light-hearted mood.",1341619200,2,1668,4.714776632302406
3417933,5,B0018O5WTQ,"Actually, I had never seen ""The Love Boat"" before.  But, because so many of my favorite stars appeared as guests on the show, I decided to give it a try.  I have watched several episodes and have enjoyed not only the guest stars but the regular cast immensely.  Top-notch romantic comedy series offers a perfect mix of laughs and s bit of drama, as well.  One of Aaron Spelling's best shows ever.",1312243200,,396,4.458333333333333
3417934,4,B0018O5WTQ,"The last 12 episodes from THE LOVE BOAT's first season, including the ""Movie of the Week"" special which launched the official series.  Join the crew of the Pacific Princess, including cruise director Julie McCoy (Lauren Tewes), Captain Merrill Stubing (Gavin MacLeod), Dr. Adam Bricker (Bernie Kopell), Purser ""Gopher"" Smith (Fred Grandy) and bartender Isaac Washington (Ted Lange) for comedy, drama, and yes, romance on the high seas.

Co-producers Aaron Spelling and Douglas Cramer were instrumental in setting the bar for this kind of ""glamour television"", helped by fashion designer Nolan Miller, who swathes the parade of guest stars in glittery sea attire.  What often jars however (especially this early in the game) was the recycling of guest stars, sometimes only weeks apart--for example, Michele Lee returns in TWO stories in this volume (including a lavish two-parter), but she'd already appeared in another episode earlier in the season!  Four episodes in the first season alone (and three separate characters)!  Isn't that some sort of record?  Patty Duke, Diana Canova and Robert Urich are three more frequent passengers with ""multiple character disorder"".  No matter.  Whatever floats the boat, I suppose.

Stephanie Zimbalist, Kathy Bates, Vicki Lawrence to name a few.  You also get to see some old favorites, Pearl Baily, Bob Crane, Leslie Nielsen.  I was surprised that some stars appeared more than once.  Must have been after the first season that it became a ""status symbol"" to appear on Love Boat! We recommend this for anyone who wants to feel great while watching a classic!

The sexual innuendo was lost on me as a little kid, but it is very much apparent watching the show as an adult why so many people tuned in all those years ago, it's been a blast watching season 1 and the first half of 2, these have got to be selling well enough to keep the sets coming I hope, we're both looking forward to more and those TV movies and any outtakes in future releases would be very much appreciated. Take a chance, you might be surprised how much fun memories these bring back!!!",1235260800,4,803,4.4324324324324325

As an adult, I understand more of the storylines, etc. and I still love the show.  I found it just as funny, and in some cases, funnier, than when I watched it as a kid.  It's great to see the shows again and I can't wait for the remaining seasons.  It's good, somewhat mindless at times, entertainment and fun to reminisce and see it through adult eyes.",1231286400,2,488,4.052083333333333
