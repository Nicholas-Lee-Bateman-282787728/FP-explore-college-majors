2562553,3,B000FFJ8PI,"""ARGH! WHAT KIND OF SERIES IS THIS?"" was my first thought after watching the first few episodes. It's a natural reaction, when putting it into context with the natural progression of the rest of the series. Shakugan no Shana as a series taken in entirity is a decent one, filled with a fair share of romance, character development, action, and comedy, among others. Yet undoubtedly the beginning is misleading. There is a definite horror element and a darker feel to the series at it's entrance. People's souls are being eaten by horrific monsters and their evil-intentioned masters. These monsters, or 'Rinne' in the early episodes are portrayed as demonic, horror-influenced (specifically, the ball of talking heads, along with the psychotic enormous baby). The second episode has a depressing, thoughtful tone (which I personally found intriguing, although many would argue that this is perhaps the most boring episode in the series). If you've stopped on either episode, please understand that neither is representative of the series as a whole.

While the series begins with a seemingly dark, gothic and emo environment(the darkness of animation, the use of many night scenes, the costuming, the entirity of the depressing second episode, perhaps Yuuji's, and other characters' emotional struggles over the full series), the series moves further and further away from this sense, and the character development builds all of the characters to being more hopeful, more brave, and more likable. The worst part of the first few episodes is simply that the 'feel' of them seem so out of context. Shakugan at it's core is not a dark series that might be seen in the 'hopeless' vibes of the beginning episodes. While a percentage of the series is spent on battles and contemplation, at others there is classic high school drama, quirky humor (melon bread, anyone?), and connections that bridge the experiences of the main characters to the audience. The WORST part about the first episodes is simply that they do what must be done, familiarize you with the surroundings of Shana's fantasy world (the names, the characters, the city) to set up the entertainment to come (just wait for the final story arc, it's an amazing reward for the wait).

**SUMMARY OF MY REVIEW**

If you haven't yet watched any further in, Don't look at the seres from a perspective of a few episodes. I nearly quit watching at the beginning, too. give it a chance, at least watch the first half. I'll bet you'll begin to enjoy it just as I did. Yes, the first episodes are admittedly weak, but there is light at the end of the tunnel.",1167264000,11,2606,4.945205479452055
2562554,5,B000FFJ8PI,"This is one of the best animes I have seen in a while. While the first episodes (the ones in this DVD) are a little slow, and weird (talking to a doll), if you can get past that, the storyline develops and hooks you until you won't want to stop watching it. Overall, there are some cliche anime things here and there, but the production quality is high, and it has a unique blend of genres. A little sci-fi, romance, comedy, and action all put together form an unforgetable experience.",1165708800,4,485,4.4
2562555,3,B000FFJ8PI,"There is nothing in this series that is particularly memorable other than the main character herself, Shana, who is popular for not much else other than being adorable.  The story line is pretty standard for anime; mysterious magic girl, meets mysterious magic guy, love triangle ensues, save the world, series end.  Other than the main character the rest are pretty boring and not that well developed save a couple, one of whom is only developed directly in her relation to Shana.  It's not executed particularly well but it's enough to keep anime fans entertained enough to sit through the series at least.

Once again, it's not a bad series, just average.",1163980800,13,658,4.900900900900901
2562556,4,B000FFJ8PI,"A funny phenomena I've noticed lately is that anime fans seem to be forming into groups of a sort. People who like certain types of animes. Shana seems to be most favored by the group of people who like pseudo H-game animes, such as Fate/Stay Night. Not all of this ""type"" of anime comes from those PC games (Shana being one example, I believe it originally comes from Japanese novels) but when they turn into anime they share certain traits that to me define a genre. The trend is to have a show with relaxed pacing and a fairly serious mood, a developing plot that doesn't stagnate, exactly one significant male character, and exactly 4 or 5 girls to keep him company. But I'm not talking about the typical harem anime, that's a different genre entirely (shows like Tenchi Muyo, generally with a silly and idiotic atmosphere).

Shana has much more action and fight scenes than the typical H-game anime but I still think it falls under that category. The story appears like it might have a few shortcomings, but the overall production quality of this series is impressively high. This is the kind of show that I like, so I'm giving it a 4 star rating overall, but this anime does feel like the kind of show that is more likely to be enjoyed by certain audiences, rather than being something for everyone.

Directing: 3 out of 5 stars. Acceptably average for modern anime.
Story: 2 out of 5 stars. I found it kind of far-fetched and uninteresting. Could get better as the series progresses, though.
Drawing style: 5 out of 5 stars. Superb. Both the art style of character designer Noizi Ito and the slightly different style used in the anime.
Drawing quality: 5 out of 5 stars. About as un-degenerated and consistent episode to episode as one can get with a 24 episode TV series.
Animation quality: 5 out of 5 stars. Superb fighting scenes with high quality framerates and an excellent sense of movement and motion.
Background drawings: 3 out of 5 stars. Average.
Music: 4 out of 5 stars. This is mostly in regards to the BGM, which is composed by the same guy who did the BGM for Zatch Bell, although I think his songs in Shana are not as good as his songs in Zatch Bell (which I would give 5 stars). The ending song for Shana is composed by someone else and is fairly decent. The opening song sucks but I can live with it. It's by I've Sound, a studio that mainly does H-game intro songs, but created by their secondary composer not the main guy so the song is weak.",1162684800,14,2468,4.482222222222222
2562557,2,B000FFJ8PI,"As high school student Yuji Sakai is making his way home from school, the street is suddenly sealed off  by a  strange  barrier, with the busy crowds freezing in place as a gigantic baby walks among them, eating their essences, much to the delight of a quivering ball of distorted human heads! Yuji seems to be the only one that can move and is aware of what is going on. The two monsters notice him and call him a ""Mystes"" and are about to eat him when a red-haired girl wielding a sword comes to his rescue, slicing and dicing the two horrors!  Yuji thanks the girl but the only reply she makes is to call him ""Scum""!  She calls him this because unknown to Yuji, he is no longer human.  Beings from The Crimson World calling themselves ""Denizens"" regularly send their servants to Earth to harvest human beings. The girl,  a ""Flame Haze"",  exists to defeat the Denizens but also to create ""Torches"",  temporary copies of those that have been eaten. Much to Yuji's horror, the girl (who he later names Shana), reveals that HE is a torch and only has a short time to live until he disappears and is forgotten by everyone he ever knew!

It's hard to take a show seriously when it starts out with a 5-story man and woman eating baby walking the city streets. I mean, really how goofy can you get? And then when you see the true form of  the monster, a talking child's doll, it takes down the intensity factor a bit. Add to that, the main bad guy has a doll fetish and talks to them and caresses them in a pretty disturbing fashion. Can there be any human drama, can you take this anime seriously after this setup? It's almost as bad as Serial Experiments Lain when God turns out to be a fruity looking guy with a toga hovering around him. Otaku whose taste can be satisfied with any girl holding a sword will probably like this show, but it just didn't work for me. Even in the most emotional bits when Yuji has to face the knowledge of his true existence, or even more touching, when he has to see the Torch of a girl he knew be extinguished, we always cut to a scene of the weirdo holding a  doll and whispering sweet-nothings in its ear as the doll declares its love in a baby girl voice.  It probably would have been a good show if the villain design would have been handled better.",1158710400,5,2283,4.293706293706293
2562558,5,B000FFJ8PI,yea thought id let everyone know who is interested in buying this dvd yea you should. this is a really great show (just to let u know though) the anime kinda leaves of like there could be a second season even though right now there are no plans for it maybe if the movie does well! yes the movie comes out next year! watch this show i think this show has something that would appeal to everyone. its really great!!!!,1156291200,7,416,4.2125

8121661,4,B000FFJ8PI,This volume the anime series begins. There is little action here though. There is much about death here. But it still interesting to watch. Here you learn about what is going on & the flame hazes purposes.,1374710400,,205,4.5675675675675675
8121662,5,B000FFJ8PI,"The story line has been done before. High school boy meets a girl with special powers. Even though this theme has been rehashed over and over; this series is surprisingly good. Yuji is a normal guy who happens to run into the flame haze, Shana. Shana fights a never ending battle with beings from a parallel dimension that eat human souls. The story is about the bond of their friendship and their fight to save the world. There are a lot of things about this anime to like. The animation is really good, the voice acting is good and the characters are interesting. Each episode keeps you wanting to keep watching more. As the relationships between the characters grows stronger the show becomes more captivating. The picture is clear and the colors are vivid. The worst part about the show is that I have to wait to see the 2nd season. I really liked Shakugan no Shana and I'm looking forward to the 2nd season. It's not a new idea but it's still a really enjoyable anime. Give it a shot why don't ya.",1355616000,,1002,4.451086956521739
8121663,5,B000FFJ8PI,"I have seen at least 52 different kinds of anime, but nothing is compared to Shakugan No Shana. I love this anime and how Japanese voice actors played their roles were simply amazing. Shana is a cute and unbelievably strong. There is no other anime show like this. This anime show is by the same creators of Aria the Scarlet Ammo, and Hayate No Gotoku. If your a fan of those shows or even if your not this is the ultimate anime show above any anime shows. I love Shakaugan No Shana. :)",1335052800,,486,4.236559139784946
8121664,4,B000FFJ8PI,"""Shakugan No Shana"" is a memorable, yet average anime. There is really nothing special I could say about it. While it will turn some people off completely it will also rest in the hearts of many others.

Story:  The story is set around Yuji Sakai, who regular boy who has just begun his high school days. While heading home one day the world around him freezes in place and in front of him appears a Tomogara, also known as Crimson Denizens, evil creatures that eats the soul of humans. Along with the appearance of the Tomogara a red haired girl so appears on the scene saving Yuji, but also proclaiming him that he has already died. While it may seem like spoilers the summary above are just all from the first episode of the series. ""Shakugan No Shana"" has a particularly interesting start to it the anime really take it's time for things to pick up. When it does pick up this anime become stock full with high romance drama along with hefty amount of action. Though I should mention that actions in this anime may not be up to par with the many action animes out there, but that it's bad it's not just as good.

Characters: I think this where the series itself makes it's mark. While many of the character are so generic some that some main characters will seem like imported clones from another series. Although, the series does makes it up to you through the actions of these generic characters. What I mean is that while the personalities in each character feels cliche at times, their actions lights up the stage bright enough that it might make you forget that your watching an anime filled with cliche characters.

Presentation: The animation (drawing, designs) is what you would expect to see in the average anime. The animation doesn't go the extra mile to impress you with the fine details in the background, or eye candy scenery, but they didn't drop the ball and leave you with something a 5th grade would sketch. The music in the anime is what you would expect too. In action scenes, you'll be greeted with a heart-pumping music and in dramatic scenes you'll be listening to something soft and touching. The background music isn't impressive enough that will make you go out and back the soundtrack, but it does it job right for this series.

Conclusion: ""Shakugan No Shana"" is a good anime and for every flaw the anime has it makes it up to you in another way. Although I do have a hard time recommending a purchase, (as of Feb 2011) the price of a complete season 1 cost around $49 - $50 having been released for over 5 years the pricing a bit too much.

Other anime to recommend if your interested in ""Shakugan No Shana"".

8121665,5,B000FFJ8PI,"I started watching Shakugan no Shana a few months ago, and I'm happy I did. Unlike many animes, Shakugan no Shana does not take a while to get into the story. It gets right into it. The characters are very well done, which is the main reason I kept watching. And I've seen quite a bit anime with poor character development. (Not poor stories, just poor characters)

For anyone who was wondering about the level of violence, well, this anime is violent (you figure that out in the first episode), but not gory. For example, there is no blood at all when Yuji's arm gets cut off (to be honest, most people could handle that scene). So yes it's violent, but it's not gory.

Well, I'll keep watching Shana. Hopefully it will get better and better. Until then, all I have to say is that I highly recomend this anime.",1251676800,2,811,4.4
8121666,5,B000FFJ8PI,"This review is for the whole Shana series. This is one of the Best Animes I have ever seen. The story line is so different yet I LOVED IT. The characters are really likeable. Shana just rocks. ^_^
The voice acting by the Japanese and English dub is some of the best. The only bad thing was I didn't want it too end! =)",1205020800,4,318,3.984375
8121667,5,B000FFJ8PI,"Unbelievable show!  I am still blown away by the magic and the vibrant world that has been created for our two main characters.  This story will make you think twice about the world we live in; who is real, who is not, and how many people we have lost.  If this wasn't enough a love triangle is thrown into the mix, just to shake things up.  Who will our man choose will it be the girl next door or the girl that came out of nowhere?  You will have to find the answer to this question by watching, sorry.  Time and again you will be taken be surprise by what small sayings truly connect us to one another and how our actions affect each other.  These are the most important of everything since most of us have been in these types of situations.  The creators did a spectacular job in finding ways to make us care for these characters.  Please pick this up if you enjoyed Fullmetal Alchemist you will enjoy this!",1193961600,,911,4.25
8121668,5,B000FFJ8PI,"First, I was intrigued by the manga, which I picked up and read first. Yes, it had a lot of backstory to explain. But I was still drawn to it, and found it very interesting. I have heard of this series of being called a ripoff of Bleach. There are about two similarities in premise, and there the resemblance ends. However, if I were to compare it to Bleach, for those of you familiar (if not, you have homework)... If it were an alternate take, it would be as if the story only focused on Rukia and Ichigo, without a stupid teddy bear named Kon. <Gasp!> Unlike Bleach, most villains in this series really do not last long, so if one of them happens to be slightly annoying for a while, hey... you don't have long to wait 'till he's toast :)
  Initially, I was turned off from watching this series right away, because of the uninspiring other reviews I read posted on Amazon. I am horribly, horribly sad that I had ever paid them any attention. Since then, I have already watched all 24 episodes of the first season. I can't wait until the movie is released on dvd, as well as the second season starting next year.

First of all, the storyline has a good amount of background that takes a bit to explain. All moderately epic stories have the same problem to deal with: How do you explain a ton of back story to an audience while still maintaining interest? Animes typically make one of two choices: A.) Jump into the storyline right away, while the viewer is constantly wondering ""what the hell is going on, and why do I care..."" or, B.) Explain everything all at once, and hope the audience isn't asleep by the time the story actually begins.
I think that this series did a good job with this. Yes, the first two episodes are basically there to set the scene. However, when the series gets rolling, it really gets rolling. I watched episodes 7 through 21 in one gulp, only stopping to go to sleep. The next day I finished episodes 22-24. It's a brilliant show, and I really just can't get enough. It's about a girl with a big sword... (what's not to love?)... but also, it's about a boy and a girl who learn more about themselves through the actions of the other. It's about people finding out if they are special or worthless, and despite otherwise circumstances, that they are not ""just"" anything, but more.

More people should give this show a chance, it certainly deserves it. And to all you reviewers out there, how about you watch more than four episodes before you start saying anything bad? I can't remember ever watching the first four episodes of anything and coming to a good decision. To tell the truth, when I first read Naruto and Bleach, I thought that they were merely mediocre. 365 chapters later of Naruto, 286 later of Bleach, hundreds of combined episodes.... Well, needless to say, they are two of my favorites.",1186790400,10,2833,4.484496124031008
8121669,3,B000FFJ8PI,"Shakugan no Shana, which I've been told translates to Shana of the Burning Eyes, is an anime series who's got a decent concept behind it but is almost totally ruined by lousy execution. It's based on a novel series, which should its first English edition later this summer, and it shows. As like the Scrapped Princess, the script writers couldn't figure out a way to convert the information dumping/ world building narration from a novel into the visual language of film. Instead of showing, these first four episode features the characters standing around and talking a lot about the show's fantasy concepts.

Shana takes place almost entirely in the real world. Monsters from the crimson world periodically wander in from an alternate dimension to eat people's souls. Flame Hazes, warriors from the crimson world, track down these monsters, kill them, and replace the dead humans with torches, emotion-less copies that eventually fade out as if they never existed at all. Yuji, the main character, witnesses such an event, and learns that he is Torch himself. A very special Torch though. He's like a cracker-jack box, in that he has some sort of treasure inside him, but since its given him an extraordinary lifespan for a Torch, its more valuable than a decoder ring. The Flame Haze he meets, he takes to calling Shana, since she has no name of her own. Shana is a rather unpleasant character as she's rude, dismissive, and cold. Yuji, with his compassion and optimism, serves as a character foil for Shana. I'm betting I could probably guess correctly what turns her characterization will take before this is over.

Shana is here to track down a certain Crimson Denizen, the master-mind behind all the monster attacks. Another flaw beside the bad script writing, and predictable characterization, is that Shana has such a sad nemesis. I don't mean sad as in a tragic villain, but one that is just pathetic. It's a rather foppish fellow with a doll fetish and his henchwoman, Marianna, a squeaky-voiced, 5 inch tall rag doll.

The single point in Shana's favor is that it looks good. It's an attractive show with a bright and striking color palette, but I question if such a perky design is appropriate for such dark subject matter. However, I'd rather watch something with a good story with less technical merits than something pretty and vacuous.

Here's to hoping that the good concepts found here are executed with more grace in its source material. This is one series that could be easily skipped.",1170028800,14,2506,4.889411764705883
