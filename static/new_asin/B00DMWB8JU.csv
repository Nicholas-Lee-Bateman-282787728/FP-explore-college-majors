5834413,5,B00DMWB8JU,"I almost passed this up in my local bookstore, but I am certainly glad I didn't! The DVD version I have has two other films on it: JFK RECKLESS YOUTH and THE WOMEN OF CAMELOT.  Haven't watched those yet, but the main attraction is absolutely outstanding!

First off, it was sublime to watch a contemporary thriller with no CGI effects, no car chases, no explosions, no wanton murderous rampages, no unbelievable cartoonish stunts, no ongoing gun battles, no gratuitous sex.  What remains is a highly original movie wonderfully written and superbly directed by one Tony Zavaleta.  SPOILER ALERT: The story is - as Winston Churchill once said of Russia - a ""riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma."" The movie is Hitchcockian in every best sense of that adjective.  The story and characters and acting are all totally believable.  The fact that Mr. Zavaleta grounds his suspenseful tale on the ongoing mystery of the actual Babushka Lady and what she may have captured on film that dark day in Dealy Plaza is also most rewarding.  Yes, her and her undiscovered film remain one of the myriad unanswered questions that make thinking people pause in accepting any easy answer as to who killed Kennedy and why.

The other thing about this fabulous film is the larger picture that can be found beyond the movie's particulars.  Questions resonant with one's own life may well be raised if one thinks beyond the perfectly paced plot of THE BYSTANDER THEORY. How much do we really know - not just of large historical events such as the JFK assassination - but of the backstories behind the family photo albums up on the closet shelf and the happy home movies now converted to DVDs of relatives long gone?  A simple day in the life is not merely made of moments and minutes, but is made of memories and motives beyond that which is captured on film.  There is often untold sadness behind the smiles captured on film - just as there may be untold others involved in what we see, for example, on the Zapruder film.  THE BYSTANDER THEORY tells us powerfully and vividly that behind the scenes of any photo or film there are questions upon questions that we may never know the answers to if, indeed, there are actual answers to be had.

Two tiny caveats: if a viewer knows little or nothing about the assassination, certain major scenes in this movie will most likely be baffling.  Also, the music score - though quite good - is a bit too obvious in a number of scenes. Otherwise, this low-budgeted, apparently direct-to-video film with no big name stars (but all of them wonderful actors!) does what practically no film out of Hollywood has done in quite some time, and that is involve and engross the viewer richly and rewardingly.  This is truly a small treasure - and for under seven bucks it is a steal!",1386374400,8,2798,4.670061099796334
5834414,5,B00DMWB8JU,"I really was delighted with this film. This is not a big budget film but it is one of the most beautifully written films I have seen in years. Completely satisfying and spellbinding. The suspense starts, shifts, starts again and shifts again. They kept me guessing and I never got bored. Best of all it does not insult your intelligence. The casting is wonderful and the characters are real. I live in Texas and I know people like them. (My only criticism: The director made a couple of logic mistakes with the film projector but only my generation would catch it.) With so many bad films out this days this one is a wonderful surprise.",1385942400,2,636,4.539130434782609
5834415,4,B00DMWB8JU,"Very entertaining. There are numerous movies, obviously, regarding the assassination of JFK. This one takes a fresh look at an aspect I've never seen before, and does it well. Top notch writing, directing and acting. Check this one out!",1384992000,,236,5.076923076923077
5834416,5,B00DMWB8JU,Great story line & twists.  It grabs your attention and keeps it throughout the entire movie.  It's a must see!,1384300800,,111,4.5
5834417,4,B00DMWB8JU,Excellent acting and plot.  Love Wendy Zavaleta in this movie.  Hope to see more of her in the future.  The film leaves the possibility of a sequel to this to find out if the mysterious film captured the real shooter.  I want more......,1382832000,3,236,4.4186046511627906
5834418,5,B00DMWB8JU,"The movie was well-written with no ""fluff"". It keeps moving and keeps you guessing until the end. Main character did a nice job.",1381795200,,128,4.608695652173913
5834419,5,B00DMWB8JU,I was very entertained by this compelling and provocative take on the mystery of the JFK assassination.  Inspired by actual people and events the story has so many dynamic twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat.  I highly recommend this film if you love history and enjoy a great mystery/suspense film.,1381104000,3,316,4.625
5834420,4,B00DMWB8JU,"As someone who has researched the JFK assassination, I enjoy movies based around its history. This movie is an intelligently scripted mystery/thriller with the assassination back story. The movie is based in Austin and Brockmeyer Tx, making for great scenery (what can I say, I love Tx). The twists and turns will keep you guessing throughout the movie. Happy to own it and will watch again.",1380326400,6,391,4.9393939393939394
5834421,4,B00DMWB8JU,"This is the sort story-driven piece that Hollywood should take note of.  Great pacing and a tight script make this independent stand out from the usual dialogue-chewing hipster pap that dominates the indy film scene.
It's a good little mystery with some JFK conspiracy, action, and suspense thrown in for good measure.  The cast has a nice mix of newcomers and veteran character actors that you may recognize...most notably Brad Leland of Friday Night Lights fame as the grizzled host of a conspiracy radio program a la Coast to Coast AM.

It's not perfect, but strong performances, some complex plot twists, and a lot of heart go a long way to make this a strong first entry for writer/director Tony Zavaleta.
Recommended.",1374192000,11,723,4.909836065573771

5834423,4,B00DMWB8JU,"This was a very interesting film that deals with not only the Kennedy assignation, but also relationships, trust, and perseverance.  I won't say much more than that, because it would be very easy to ruin this film with much more information.  I really enjoyed the mystery and intrigue that ran throughout the film.  Watch it!",1430524800,2,325,4.872727272727273

5834427,5,B00DMWB8JU,"This is an awsome film!
Had to see it a second time to catch everything that would seem different knowing the ending.
First time through, it's a thriller!
Second time through, the fore-shadowing gets colored in.
Not just another Kennedy-assassination film.  This is thoughtful, interesting, and has an auxiliary mystery.",1390521600,5,320,5.4
5834428,5,B00DMWB8JU,"I really enjoyed this movie. There are a lot of JFK movies out there, and I have seen many of them. This one is particularly well written and acted, and very nice visually as well. It's a nice, unique take on a theory. Well done.",1388102400,4,229,4.111111111111111
5834429,1,B00DMWB8JU,"This low-budget home movie lures viewers with the long-running controversy of the Kennedy assassination, but all it delivers is more anticipation.  Don't waste your time or money.",1388102400,,179,5.62962962962963
5834430,2,B00DMWB8JU,Fun supposition of what could have happened but not factual at all so falls short of my expectations.  No wonder it never showed on TV as planned,1387152000,,145,4.37037037037037
5834431,1,B00DMWB8JU,"The plot itself was good.  The wife and I both thought the acting was horrible. Furthermore, by doing research online I found out he main character in the movie is married to the director. So how good of an actor can the main character be? That right there should be a pretty good tip that the acting is going to be bad.  The acting is beyond horrible.",1386460800,,352,4.2388059701492535

8594610,4,B00DMWB8JU,"I have to give this film an  ""A"" for effort.  Had it been the beneficiary of a high budget, big name stars, an experienced director, and some tinkering with dialog, it would have likely been a fairly decent success.  The ""bones"" of the plot itself are actually pretty sound, and the people involved in the production did well when you consider that most of them probably haven't yet had a great deal of experience under their belts.  There's a lot of potential here.

In other words, it was well done when you consider their current level of abilities and budget considerations.  We all have to start somewhere, don't we?  And for what is probably *very* early in many of their careers, this isn't a bad little film.

And, viewed from that standpoint, it was entertaining enough for me to actually watch in it's entirety.",1487548800,,821,4.652777777777778
8594611,4,B00DMWB8JU,"This is an intelligent, thoughtful movie about loss in the family and fragile or broken relations, featuring a likeable but misguided conspiracy nut (played by Brad Leland).  While the film touches on the phenomenon of JFK-conspiracy theory, it's not itself a contribution to that dubious genre.  It does not purport to solve any questions about who shot the president.  The only thing it suggests is a solution to one unsolved mystery:  Who was the babushka lady standing at an ideal spot on Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963, and why has her identity remained unknown all these years?

Another major theme: People tend to see what they expect to see, not what is really there in front of them  this starts right at the beginning with the husband (Ben) who misinterprets the hug his wife gives another man, leading to his jealousy and rage, the beating of the other man and him finally pulling a gun on his wife.

On the whole, a thoughtful, intelligent movie that will reward more than one viewing.  On the downside, it is sometimes a little too clever for its own good, since it expects the audience to comprehend everything that the characters themselves have a hard time puzzling out.  Plus it comes with no extras, not even subtitles, so it's hard to tell if the main character's ex-husband is called ""Van"" or ""Ben"" (which, confusingly, is also her grandpa's name) or ""Brian.""

And as Native Texan noted in his Amazon review, The director made a couple of logic mistakes with the film projector but only my generation would catch it. Still, being a generous spirit, Native Texan gave the movie five stars.  He's right about one thing  the director (Tony Zavaleta) evidently doesnt know much about 8mm or the home movies of that era.  For instance we hear the sound of the film moving through the projector when we see the film is in fact stopped.  Also, at one point Ben takes a selfie, which was not something people ordinarily did with their cameras back in the 50s and early 60s  the resulting pictures were too likely to be out of focus and way off center.  So this is anachronistic.  While the director and his crew did succeed in making the film stock look old (that technical detail was okay), it was the human behavior that was off.",1473206400,,2246,4.659898477157361
