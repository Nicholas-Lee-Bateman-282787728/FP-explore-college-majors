8582075,1,B00CIOFW2C,"Like shark movies, Bigfoot movies are a dime a dozen, and while few are good, many are entertaining. ""Fear the Forest"" is neither. This is one of the worst of all Sasquatch movies I have ever seen, and is relentlessly cheap and poorly made. Don't get me wrong: I love work from new filmmakers and am fine with microbudgets, but some things are either too bad to watch or are too cheap to convey onscreen in a reasonably palatable way, and sometime it's better to just stay home and save your money to buy the things and take the time to make a better movie later. This was one of those times.

The premise: Bigfoot is loose in the woods of New York, kids and hunters are also in the woods, and random violence ensues. The cover art on the DVD actually looks pretty good, but unfortunately the creature effects are beyond atrocious. After a ridiculous hunter confrontation in the forest (groan), we cut to a college class on Sasquatches (which given the other courses colleges are now offering is the most plausible part of this entire film). If you can understand what is going on despite the terrible sound (and horrid music)...oh what am I saying? Of course you know what's going on. Kids are on their way to die grisly deaths in the forest, but first, the worst party ever filmed meshes with a stupid prank and the most pointless interpersonal conflict in recent memory...wait...why is Wendy vomiting? Oh, never mind.

The kids are canoeing and are being observed from shore. There's an ancient legend (of course), some of which is subtitled, involved, and that's never good for long life expectancy. Note: the editing and scene matching is horrendous, especially in this part of the movie. Seriously, Ed Wood could have taught these guys lessons about lucid continuity. The editing matches the acting which is in a league of its own. Wendy (Elana Safar) is the worst actress on display here, but fortunately she is a particularly slow and stupid target. And oh yeah, she was vomiting because she was supposedly pregnant. Not that it figures into the arc of the story in any meaningful way. It's obvious that hormonal love will blossom among the Sasquatch, and just as we're getting to the climactic battle of the two remaining above average looking survivors versus the Bigfoot there arehillbillies? Yep. Two dimwitted gun-toting guys kidnap the pretty girl and shoot the guy and then enjoy a game of Russian roulette with the cutest girl, Barbara (Anna Kendrick) tied to a tree in her survival crop top and white pants. Just remember: don't drink and shoot. As it turns out, Bigfoot does not like Russian roulette but when you finally see the face of this Bigfoot you will scream in horror. That's a lie. You'll laugh out loud. This monster is one of the most hilarious in any movie I have ever seen. It evokes the same horror as a Sid and Marty Krofft production, looking like something from ""Sigmund and the Sea Monsters"" (Blurp or Slurp, not Johnny Whitaker I mean) more than any Bigfoot I have ever conceived of. Let's just call it what it is: worst Bigfoot ever.

The film closes with the introduction of a completely insane plot twist that is both predictable and completely illogical, and about which the less said is better. I do wonder how Barbara, the ultra-protected Governor's daughter, suddenly is so good at fighting, but after some very plausible fisticuffs in which the Bigfoot turns out to be the good guy (kind of) we get the wrap up involving the fakest looking news and reporting footage since ""Birdemic"", all tied together with a story of post-Bigfoot encounter induced PTSD (really) that made me say out loud to no one in particular ""Can this be almost over?""

Then my worst fear: there's a title card that says ""Two Years Later"" and more teens are in the dark and scary woods. At first I thought the end wasn't near, but fortunately it was. Unfortunately ""Fear the Forest"" wasn't quite done with me yet as I cautiously waded into its extras. Please note the interview with director Matthew Mora and actor Don Evans (among others)...""It was a blockbuster type idea"" was actually said in all seriousness. The deleted scenes made me yawn, while the music videos were insufferable. The standout of the extras, believe it or not, is the director's biography, which is way over the top (he was on ""The Dating Game""! Oh, brother.)

""Fear the Forest"" is a Bigfoot movie. If you simply feel compelled to watch each and every Bigfoot movie ever made, you should watch it, but do yourself a favor and make it the last one on your list.",1473379200,,4552,4.685

8582077,1,B00CIOFW2C,"This is one of the worse Bigfoot movies out there. This one is low budget/low quality film that takes place in Mohawk Valley, New York.  Kids in the woods are bothered by Bigfoot. Northern Valley was spelled ""Nothern Valley."" Ancient Indian had elastic band headdress. The Bigfoot effects include a red filter. The Anna Kendrick in this film is also not the same as the big star. The fighting choreography was funny. I don't think Anna can lift her foot above her knee.

Has some camp value.

8582078,5,B00CIOFW2C,i liked the bigfoot movies so i enjoyed the movie and it played great so thank you so much for the dvd,1392163200,,102,3.6818181818181817
8582079,4,B00CIOFW2C,"Low budget to be sure.  The casting and acting was mediocre to good for this genre.  There were some good effects although in most of the ""creature scenes"" the monster didn't look all that good.  It was not the worst in film, but still left a lot of room for improvement.  One disappointment was that it seemed a portion of the film was charged somewhat politically, in particular against Sportsmen.  A few scenes really featured a lot of negative with no positive for balance.  However, they seemed like they did some research into the pseudoscience referenced in the film for authenticity.  Overall this film met my tastes fairly well and I'm glad I made the purchase.  The only way to know what will suite one's taste is to try it for themselves.",1382832000,,749,4.621212121212121
8582080,2,B00CIOFW2C,"As a guy who has been behind the camera a couple of times, I know the joys and pains that being a filmmaker can bring.  Making movies is definitely not as easy as some people think.  Because I realize how tough the process can be, I always feel bad when I have to give a negative review to a low-budget film.  Such is the case here with FEAR THE FOREST.  This film has its heart in the right place, but unfortunately the execution is far from enjoyable.

I really wanted to like this one.  The cover looks cool and the premise sounds intriguing.  But sometimes a film can simply be TOO low-budget.  The production in this film falls flat and the resulting product looks (and sounds) like a high school A/V project gone bad.

FEAR THE FOREST is one of those films that could be a blockbuster hit...if it had a bigger budget, if it had better acting and special effects, and if it was promoted correctly (I personally don't think a monster or creature should ever be put on a DVD cover...let us find out what it looks like in the film!).  As you can see, that's a big list of `ifs', and its just too overwhelming.

The film looks as if it were shot on an old VHS home video camera.  The sound is way too muted and, in some cases, the actors cannot be heard over wind and ambient background noise.  The blood/gore doesn't look too great (looks evidently fake), although the creature effects are not half bad.  I'm not sure if I would have chosen the particular look for the Bigfoot legend, but they do look pretty good onscreen.

As much as it pains me to say this, I cannot with a clear conscience recommend this film to anyone.  I'm sure it is a labor of love, however FEAR THE FOREST is simply so low-budget that it hurts.  I would give this one a pass and wait to see what director Matthew Bora does next.",1377648000,3,1806,4.28023598820059
8582081,5,B00CIOFW2C,I haven't seen this movie yet but my friend says it's a real scary movie. So I pre-ordered it for myself. I just hope I didn't waste my money on this one.,1372032000,,154,3.84375
