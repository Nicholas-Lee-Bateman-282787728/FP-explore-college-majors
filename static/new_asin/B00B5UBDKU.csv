8563030,5,B00B5UBDKU,"Forgive me but I am a long time opera fan, but not a schooled critic.  I only know what I like and don't like.  I bought this particular disc because I thought it would be nice to have a blu ray version  (I don't recall seeing a blu ray version of anything operatic before), and it seemed like it was a traditional Viennese staging.  I had never seen or heard Cheryl Barker before, but judging from the photos on the disc box she appeared to be a perfect Feldmarchalin.  I hesitated over the decsion to buy for a long time because the price of the blu ray was nearly twice that of the regular DVD version.  So I felt like I was taking a big risk when I finally comitted to the purchase.  I'm happy to say that I was not disappointed with my decsion after I watched it.  It is a very beautiful production, the singing and music is great, it sounds great and also looks great. Ms. Barker really is a great Feldmarshalin.  I hope I get a chance to see her again.  The costumes and staging will please those who prefer traditional staging.  The subtitling and staging permited the comical aspects to come through quite a bit better than other recordings I have seen.  I was blown away by the soaring beauty of the big trio at the end.  If you like Der Rosenkavalier I think you will like this version.  Thank you Opera Australia for giving us opera lovers a wonderful producation with state-of-the-art technology!",1399420800,5,1409,4.38996138996139
