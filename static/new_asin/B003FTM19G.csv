4119487,5,B003FTM19G,"This movie had us laughing from beginning to end. The children in it are all exceptional actors and the writer is brilliant in his writing and humor. It is the perfect movie for whole family viewing too as there is no nudity, sex nor bad language. I was a little nervous buying this for so much $ but I'm so glad I did. Highly recommended!",1354233600,43,339,4.230769230769231

Why is it that the producers of French films ignore us, the francophiles?

I will buy any DVD from French films that have FRENCH SUBTITLES.

4119491,5,B003FTM19G,lovely film both for adults & kids.  I'll show it in French with English subtitles to the primary school pupils I teach on world book day.,1300233600,29,138,4.3076923076923075
4119492,5,B003FTM19G,"""Le petit Nicolas"" (2009) is a live-action adaptation of French children's book series. Unfortunately I haven't read any of the original stories of ""Little Nicolas"" (created by Ren Goscinny and illustrated by Jean-Jacques Semp), though I read somewhere the books are very popular in France. Well, never mind if you haven't read them either, for ""Le petit Nicolas"" is a pleasant and amusing film that everyone can enjoy.

The film's story revolves around ""Little Nicolas,"" a happy, good-natured and sensitive boy who loves his parents, and a group of his unique friends (mostly boys). No one, not even their dedicated (and kind) teacher or the pompous school superintendent, can stop the ever-resourceful children from having fun. They are not rude. They are not disobedient. The boys are just having a good time, doing their best to do something good for friends. It is only that their ""good"" is not exactly what most adults would think. For these boys, hiring a gangster over the phone is nothing special.

Set in the 50s-like nostalgic world, the film has two main stories: one about Nicolas's (groundless) fear of being abandoned by his own parents; the other about Nicolas's parents arranging a dinner with his hard-working father's boss for his promotion. These two storylines, both unpredictable and interspersed with amusing episodes, keeps a brisk pace throughout, before it concludes with a nice finale.

The 91-minute film is helmed by Laurent Tirard, whose works as director includes an engaging romantic comedy ""Molire."" With its unanimously fine cast and skillful storytelling (that sometimes becomes pleasantly satirical), ""Le petit Nicolas"" keeps you entertained until the end. Also, a very creative opening credit animation should not be missed.

Grard Jugnot, star of ""Les choristes,"" (2004) appears briefly in the chorus scene.",1290297600,93,1845,5.286689419795222

It is a movie to be enjoyed by people of all ages, of any language.",1289606400,71,352,3.9014084507042255

4119558,4,B003FTM19G,"The title and description for this movie is misleading. It is actually region 0, not region 1. It will play on virtually any DVD player around the world. There are two versions of the movie on the same DVD: Le Petit Nicolas (French) and Little Nicolas (English). You can select your version at the beginning of the DVD. The closed captions (old fashioned white text on black background) are in French only, no matter what version of the movie. The subtitles (modern but hard to read white text with thin black outlines) are in English only, also no matter what version of the movie. The cinematography is vibrant with many bright scenes, making it difficult to read the subtitles. If you are deaf like me, you will have to disable the CC on your TV or computer and enable the subtitles.

I bought the movie from an Amazon vendor kylakins before Amazon LLC got more in stock. I doubt your experience will be any different from mine.

The movie is great overall.",1484611200,3,960,4.575581395348837
4119559,5,B003FTM19G,Very funny film - with lots for the adults as well as the kids (I was a bit unsure who this film was aimed at some of the time). Highly recommended - if buying with kids in mind make sure they can handle the sub-titles. Some of the plot lines could go over smaller kids heads but it doesn't seem to matter. Warning - Allthough made recently this film is based on books set in the 50's and is definitely non-pc.,1484265600,,410,4.074074074074074

4119562,5,B003FTM19G,"The concept of Nicolas' character refers to a lost and past golden era in France during which the rising middle class was enjoying a sense of fulfillment from good wages, paid vacation time and all the new convenience appliances and technology which made life easier.

4119591,5,B003FTM19G,"This is based of the classic literature ""Le Petit Nicolas."" (more specifically the chapter ""on a eu l'inspecteur.""

He and his friends come up with multiple plans to deal with the new addition.  Not surprisingly, their plans often go awry and they have to come up with new plans.  In the meanwhile, the parents are dealing with Mr. Moucheboume and his wife coming over for dinner. Nicolas' mother does her best to try and be a ""modern day woman,"" but seems to constantly asking more of her husband. Several of the adults from this movie also appear in Les Vacances du Petit Nicolas.

4119616,3,B003FTM19G,"I was hoping for a movie a bit more like the stories of little Nicolas. Most of vignettes of the movie are inaccurate, short-cut renditions from the books, which are much funnier. Case in point is the story about the flowers Nicolas buys for his mother's birthday. The movie shortens the action and rewrites the chain of events to render a much less satisfying laugh.

I am sure he did not understand every word, but the movie is quite funny even if you don't catch every word. If you have read any Petit Nicolas stories you will enjoy how they managed to weave so many individual episodes into one coherent and hilarious story. The movie is appropriate for a high school or college classroom, but while not offensive in any way, may not be appropriate in an elementary immersion classroom. There is one scene where the humor is based on Nicolas' mother getting drunk because she is nervous and trying to impress her husband's boss. I did not mind my son seeing this (since he does not know what drunk is, he thought she was just being silly). But I would not show it to his immersion class at elementary school. On the other hand, my French 1 college class thoroughly enjoyed the movie.

4119799,5,B003FTM19G,"It has been suggested that this film is a gallic style Diary of a Wimpy Kid type of film. In both style and approach it is very much closer to the wonderful 1980 Australian Classic 'Fatty Finn', and is much the better film as a result, especially for the adults in the audience. Maxime Godart apparently effortlessly becomes the character of Nicolas, who has a very clear take on events around him, as most boys his age do. This film brings back to me all the joys and fears of my own eight year old life, and it is a joy to see that the rest of the cast get into the spirit of Nicolas' world with relish.

In any event, this movie was very cute, lighthearted and just an all-around fun family-friendly comedy. I won't tell you what it's about because you can read that for yourself, but I will say that the acting was A++, the plot was adorable and the humorous moments really were quite funny.

I am minoring in French, and we watched this movie in French class just before Thanksgiving break 2013. I immediately purchased it, I loved it that much! So if you are studying the French language, this will make a great edition to your French film library.",1385683200,2,658,4.663793103448276

4119859,4,B003FTM19G,"There's a series of short stories in several books in France called Le Petit Nicolas about a schoolboy named Nicolas.  This movie uses three or four of them for its plot.  The stories are humorous and the movie does a good job of translating them to the screen.  I like the actors who play the parents of Nicolas, but I think they're both unknown in the U.S.  At the very least, this film gives a look into the life in a French grade school.  Nicolas is not nearly as bratty as Dennis the Menace, but he gets into humorous trouble all the same.",1382140800,,544,4.242718446601942

4119924,2,B003FTM19G,"This may have been an instance of mismatched expectations. Perhaps I was expecting something gently nostalgic? Or more  subtle than a Hollywood comedy (or a Hollywood film for kids). There are occasional and wonderful moments of observational humor. Mostly, though, this is broad farce.

What the writers considered to be funny: it's nearly always based on a familiar formula, one of which I'm admittedly weary: such that this will feel more like a pet peeve than an opinion. But nevertheless, the sort of thing where characters are repeatedly (and at times sadistically) tormented, for the sake of a few chuckles? Don't like it, never did: and this film relies on it. In ways both predictable and tiresome.

(Of course, some viewers will find it more to their liking. I wouldn't want to cast aspersions on someone else's enjoyment. This isn't an awful movie; it's simply not the sort of thing I particularly enjoy.)

The young actors do a fine job. Which could have been a challenge, given that most of the characters are little more than stereotypes: i.e. the kid who eats too much, the ""dumb"" kid, the ""teacher's pet"" who's a prissy tattletale, etc. Oh but they're somewhat affectionately portrayed, as cardboard cutouts go. (Except the obsessively-studious boy. Not a surprise that he's repeatedly bullied, but appalling how he's portrayed as fully deserving of every taunt and assault.) Nicolas is more well-rounded. Not terribly interesting: although--compared to his schoolmates--he's remarkably complex.

Despite being boxed-in by similarly stereotypical characteristics? The foibles of Nicolas' parents (and of the other kids' parents, and the teacher) are a highlight, and got the most enthusiastic laughs. I recognize I may feel this way because they're adults and ""can take it."" Whereas seeing winsome, endearing kids endure mind-numbing mistreatment? Before using the word ""funny,"" I'd think of plenty of less-flattering ways to characterize their seemingly-unending woes.

Tone is everything. In Fargo many of the characters are tremendously engaging: including those who are loathsome. Even when they're placed in agonizing situations, it's hilarious.

Le Petit Nicolas, superficially, appears a charming story about a group of prepossesing (even adorable) schoolboys. Then, at length, we see them (metaphorically) put through the woodchipper. This is neither Fargo nor South Park. It doesn't feel wrong; it feels worse than wrong.",1374364800,3,2446,5.421052631578948

4119928,3,B003FTM19G,"Based on the children's book by Rene Goscinny and Jean-Jacques Sempe, this movie reminds us of the foibles of childhood. Nicolas, with his beautiful smile and big blue eyes, immediately captures our hearts.  His life appears perfect with loving parents and great friends.  As children do, he misinterprets his parent's actions and conversations creating numerous hilarious situations. A delightful family movie.",1369353600,2,411,5.721311475409836

4119955,5,B003FTM19G,"This is a cracking little French comedy made in 2009. It stars Maxim Godart as the little Nicolas and he is a talent to watch out for and has already made another two films. In this he leads what he knows is a charmed life, loving his parents, his home and his school mates  well all except the Teachers pet cockroach grass one with glasses.

Then one of their class mates has a new arrival  a baby brother and he relays that  life is now the pits for him, worse still he stops coming to school and no one knows why. Then Nicolas overhears his parents talking of a visit and they say he must be gotten out of the way. He now knows that not only will he be getting a baby brother but that they are going to dump him; possibly in the woods as the urban myths have it.

So he sets out on a charm offensive and all his school chums are going to help  badly that is. As his demise gets closer their plans become ever more urgent and funny.

This is set in the sixties and just oozes style and charm in equal dollops. The clothes the cars the primary colours and lack of office technology and casual sexism are all just brilliant, well maybe not the sexism. The acting is superb with a cast of kids that are all brilliant, entertaining and funny in all the right places. This is laugh out loud at times too and had me wanting more. Sandrine Kiberlain as their teacher deserves special mention as she is really good and well rounded as always. She is also in the ruddy excellent The Women on the sixth floor.

This is also one for the whole family as kids will definitely get it too. This tells the story and the reasons they do things all from a childs perspective and the collective naivety that can come from kid group decicions, which is just great. So for a refreshing warm, family comedy in France based sixties, you need look no further - really warmly recommended.",1362441600,,1865,4.248587570621469
4119956,5,B003FTM19G,"Set in 60s France, all in poster bright cartoon colours and a rather anarchic, slapstick performance style, this is a child's eye view of the world.

Nicolas (an enchanting performance by serious faced Maxime Godart) mistakenly assumes his mother is pregnant and is afraid he will be abandoned and unwanted when the new baby arrives. With his goofy collection of young friends he embarks on various plans to get rid of the baby.

Meanwhile, his parents are worried about money, trying to climb the social ladder, currying favour with Nicolas's father's boss - a hilarious dinner party scene, where you know every single gag before it happens, but delight in the infectious, witty performances.

This really is a totally feel-good film, but done with great wit and style, by all performers.

It is the quirkiness, the great look of the film, the expertise of the performances and somehow a lack of saccharine sentimentality that make this so good.

French Film, English subtitles, 91 minutes. This really is a film that can be enjoyed by both children AND adults. In patronises neither audience, nor does it indulge or overplay its feel-good nature. The length of the film is just right and stops the good jokes and set pieces from overstaying their welcome
