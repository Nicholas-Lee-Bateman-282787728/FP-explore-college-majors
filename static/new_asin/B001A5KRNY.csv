8276166,5,B001A5KRNY,"I have both the book and DVD's and I can fully recommend them over *any* other White Crane material on the market today. Dr. Yang is a living library on Chinese martial arts, and even his most boring book (Tai Chi - ungh) trumps most of the more mainstream stuff out there. I'm a practitioner of both Crane and Wing Chun, and it's refreshing to a more substantial book available than most of the shallow, superfluous ""How-To"" martial arts books.",1412294400,,445,4.575

8276168,5,B001A5KRNY,"Dr. Yang has provided yet another invaluable resource of martial knowledge. whether his books or dvd, Dr. Yang provides more information to his audience than the average martial author. I am a wuzuquan practioner and I found these dvds to be an outstanding demonstration of a foundational root of my system. also many of the okinawian and japanese karate practioners will be provided with invaluable insight into thier own system.",1368662400,5,430,5.1571428571428575
