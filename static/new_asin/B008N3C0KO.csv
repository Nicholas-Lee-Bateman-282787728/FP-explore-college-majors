Katie is a remarkable person whose story will touch your heart and your soul. Not only is this a beautiful love story of one woman and her relationship with God, but this is an extremely powerful evangelistic tool that you can share with family and friends. Highly recommend, don't miss it.",1393632000,3,452,4.592592592592593

8534317,5,B008N3C0KO,"This is a beautifully done video journal of an inspiring young woman, mother, daughter, wife, friend,whose legacy has and will continue to inspire and help so many others. While it is difficult to watch her final hours play out, it is a comfort to see how beloved she was, how strong she was in her faith, and how courageous she was at her weakest moments. Keep the Kleenex close by. I cried through much of it. However, I take away a sense of joy in the way she lived her life, and how her memory lives on in those she touched. Katie shows us how precious life is.",1366761600,,565,4.2407407407407405

But what I do know is Katie is a real person. She shares and says what is one her mind. What you will see in this film is Raw Video of Katie talking about her journey. I truly feel one of the reasons ""Katie's Prayer"" has been seen world wide is because she is just like you and I. You have to realize she was only sick for 7 weeks from Diagnosis. The Lord took this wonderful Mother, wife, sister, daughter and friend home at such a early age of 30. Katie left behind a loving husband and 3 kids ages 10 month to 6 yrs. Katie's Prayer has led many people to have a closer relationship with Christ. This Film also help lead her Children to have the same relationship as Katie did with Jesus. I can tell you that this film will help you. This film will guide you through a path that can be life changing.

I pray you take the opportunity to see this film and listen to my sister speak to your heart. She will talk about her personal journey of being a Christian. This journey had many lows and highs but in the end she shinned so bright. Katie I love you and want you to know I am one proud brother.

A powerful documentary of a woman's faith in the Lord that is sure to touch your heart.  while watching the video, God began to soften my heart and I began to reflect on my own walk.  After seeing the unshaken faith of Katie throughout her trial, I began remember when my walk with God was new, and my fellowship with Him was strong.  The impact of this video has brought me back into  a spiritual mindset that I haven't been able to find in a while.  Take some time and watch this Spirit filled and led documentary of how God can take even the most tragic of circumstances, and turn it around for His Glory, and growth in His Children.",1342569600,,656,4.344262295081967
