5623759,4,B00BIR4JA6,"This  dvd comprises 2 short  films. They are brilliantly written,acted,directed and photographed. I can't wait for the  director to  make more  great shorts. The first  short,set in India, is a great feel good  film despite the storyline being predictable. The  second short is the better of the two .The  storyline is  different and it takes a very talented person  to be able to write such  a brilliant  screenplay. Acting  is  superb in both shorts. With so much  garbage in gay US cinema today,these  shorts are  a rarity.",1362873600,9,526,4.850574712643678

8569099,4,B00BIR4JA6,"The amazon blurb says this is 2 movies.  Actually what we get streaming are 4 short films, and while the 1st of them, ""You Can't Curry Love,"" has already been widely circulated and enjoyed, all 4 flicks are entirely watchable.  As a collection, they hang together nicely with an agreeable tone and an admirable absence of pretension.  They're not bad on 2nd or 3rd viewing, either.",1491523200,,381,4.742424242424242

8569102,4,B00BIR4JA6,"These are four films from Reid Waterer and it was clearly made on a small budget. The first is set in India - but Bollywood it aint.  It's called `You can't curry love' and puns aside this is a rather sweet story of two men finding each other by chance. It also has a serious face when highlighting some of the homophobic attitudes still prevalent in Indian society.

The second is `Daddy's Big girl' - this is set in the US and is about a gay father who is struggling to love his overweight daughter. This is quite a touching story and was one of the strongest in terms of impact.

`Foreign Relations' is set in Greece and is about a guided tour where two men are forced to share as they didn't pay the singles supplement. This was a story that struggled to find any depth and sort of meandered - which may well have been the point but not as strong as the preceding two films.

The final one is `Performance Anxiety' and is about two straight actors preparing for a simulated sex gay scene. A rather interesting concept but the interviews at the end with them all saying how difficult it was to do etc was just a tad insulting - and the last thing a gay audience needs is straight people pointing out that we are different - even with the best possible intentions. Not a good way to finish.

Now the real criticism is that this is described as `a sexy journey around the globe' and you guessed it absolutely no sex, all a bit tame really; now whilst that never bothers me it does annoy some people so you can see why there have been criticisms. Not the best collection of short films ever but also nowhere near the worst - a mixed bag to be honest but overall well worth the watch.",1428192000,2,1683,4.263322884012539
8569103,2,B00BIR4JA6,"This pairing of two short films from director Reid Waterer, plus some filler behind the scenes bonus material, feels incomplete as a package for sale.  Surely at least two more films could or should have been included being that this is half the length of a regular shorts DVD.

For what's included, at least you get something worth the cheaper cost. The primary short is called You Can't Curry Love, a film shot Bollywood style in England and India. At almost half an hour long, it's like a mini epic, even if looks a bit cheap.  I'm hesitant to praise the film because the director will likely try and make standard silly gay comedies with hot guys and lowbrow premises. However, it is charming to see the world of India presented through a gay storyline, and some of the facts about gay life in India caught my attention as did a hot Scottish actor thrown into the mix as ""straight"" trade.

The other short called Performance Anxiety pretty much proves why praising Waterer may be premature. This is a rote by the number gay comedy where the premise is that two straight actors try to figure out how to shoot a gay sex scene. Lots of ""Bro"" and ""Dude"" comments get thrown around to prove how straight they are, all while stripping clothes and simulating sex, until its time to shoot the ""scene."" So you get them having sex twice for your time, in other words just a lot naked gay bro action until an anticlimactic finale

If you can stream it one day, it may be better to wait to see them then, but at least if you're just going to spend $10 and you like watching guy-on-guy, maybe you'll like these two shorts.",1402099200,,1613,4.454237288135594
8569104,5,B00BIR4JA6,"I was skeptical getting this dvd because of the 40 minutes of clips.  Glad that I made the purchase.  The clip You Can't Curry Love had me near tears several times, so well done in capturing east and west coming together.  One fellow is of Indian descent but born in Australia.  He learns of his roots from the front desk clerk of his motel in India.  Together they create a beautiful bond of love.

The second clip Performance Anxiety had me laughing.  Seldom does a movie get me there, however the true yet comical effort of two straight men practicing for a gay sex scene was priceless.

Both clips, the dvd, was a great add to my collection.",1393718400,,645,4.406779661016949
8569105,3,B00BIR4JA6,"The best feature of this pair of films is the wonderful background photography of India in the first of them. Each of these films needs to be expanded and developed into a full-length feature. The actors in both have a lot of charm and charisma and the all too brief scripts are interesting, if a bit sentimental and unrealistic. A pleasant, entertaining effort.",1392163200,,362,4.761904761904762

8569107,4,B00BIR4JA6,"Writer/director Reid Waterer offers two short films in his DVD, ""Global Warming.""  I'll review each separately, then give you comments on the DVD as a whole.

""You Can't Curry Love"" (2009) has been making the LGBT film festival circuit for over three years, so many of you may have already caught it.  If not, let me give you a summary:  Starts in UK, where Vikas, a young man (of Indian descent, is sent by his employer on a temporary assignment to their office in India.  While he was born in Australia, Vikas feels that he knows everything about India, until he meets hotel clerk Sunil, with whom there is an immediate mutual attraction, and he explores local sights and learns more of the culture.  It is the first time Vikas has really felt in love, but he is due back in the UK office soon.  The two leads are played by talented straight actors who do a great job in their roles.  On its own, I'd give this 23 minute film five stars out of five, and only wish it were a full-length feature.

Speaking of straight actors playing gay ... ""Performance Anxiety"" (2012) tells that story, of two heterosexual actors who agreed to be naked in a gay sex scene.  They try to push their training and experience as actors to overcome their natural, macho revulsion to what they have to do.  It's one absurd plan (When they kiss, one suggests that the other pretend to be a lifeguard giving him mouth-to-mouth!) to another (Instead of hair, imagine big breasts on his chest!), it's amusing, but - IMO - gets tiresome rather quickly.  To their credit, the two actors don't come off as homophobic, just reacting to a situation that they obviously find more uncomfortable than they had imagined it would be for an actor. The film only runs 15 minutes (but seems longer to me). Has also made the rounds at a lot of LGBT film festivals in the past years, and won some kudos.  I'll be kind and give it 3 stars out of 5,

Add the running times of the two films, and you have less than 40 minutes combined, pretty sparse for a DVD release. The writer/director apparently thought he'd pad the release with ""extras,"" which add a total of 50 minutes ... if you watch them all, including trailers, photo galleries, deleted scenes, outtakes and respective ""making of"" documentaries.

I found the ""making of"" film on ""You Can't Curry Love"" to be somewhat entertaining, and it fills in some blanks about gay life in India, which are only hinted at in the actual short film (Another reason why I think the filmmaker was foolish not to make a full-length film.)  On the other hand, the extras for ""Performance Anxiety"" are - in my opinion - intolerable. Think about it:  You have a film about straight actors in a gay movie, so the extras would be about ... you guessed it ... the straight actors PLAYING the straight actors who are making a gay movie.  Can you say redundant??  (Now, if he had hired gay actors to play the straight actors who were playing gay on screen, at least there would be something new in the extras to watch!)  Even though the two films average out to 4 stars, I am tempted to subtract one star because of the extras, but I'll be nice.",1375920000,5,3137,4.479789103690686
