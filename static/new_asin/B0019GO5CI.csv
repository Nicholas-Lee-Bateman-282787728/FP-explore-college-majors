You get the basic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rustlers-Rhapsody/dp/B0001JXPW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rustlers' Rhapsody</a>&nbsp;on disc one, but the 2nd disc is an ""I Love 80's Music"" CD.

Ticonderoga(Andy Griffith) and his ranchhands having a gabfest, outtakes of the Colonel's daughter(Sela Ward) and Blackie doing ""everything"", fashion tips from Bob Barber (Patrick Wayne), possibly Peter the Town Drunk finally punching out the sheepherder's wife, or maybe the town doctor presenting a paper to the CDC about what caused the sudden outbreak of a mysterious disease that caused holes to appear in people's gun hands.....instead of fun stuff like these, the buyer will get a CD of 80's music....whoopee...""Dude"", the 80's also included Michael Bolton....Tiffany...hell, even Jacobo Mugatu and Uli Kunkel's band Autobahn put out mierda in the 80's.
