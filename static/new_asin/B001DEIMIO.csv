8293076,5,B001DEIMIO,"First, I just want to tell you that you can get this film new from the Discovery Channel's online store for 19.95. I got mine on sale for 14.95.

I have watched over 10 films over Eygpt in the last two months. This is by far the best. It is interesting and done very well. I will be showing it to my 7th graders when we do art history (I am an art teacher). I have a degree in art history, so some of the films I watched focused entirely on ancient Eygptian civilzation and no art history which I think is ineffective when talking about ancient civilizations as their art is all we really have left. This film covers both aspects: art history with looking and giving facts about key monuments as well as speculations over the ancient Eygptian's civilization (for example, it shows the workers' camp which was found near the Pyramids which is how archeologists, art historians, and scientists have come to say that the Pyramids were not built by slave labor).

I highly recommend this film.",1248652800,7,989,4.488888888888889
