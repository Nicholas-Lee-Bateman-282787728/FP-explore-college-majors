5159111,5,B008FYZHJC,Nicholas Nickleby is a classic! To be watched time and time again...and has a fabulous surprise ending!,1420502400,,103,5.117647058823529
5159112,5,B008FYZHJC,"Saw Nicholas Nickleby by chance on either Netflix or Amazon Video - we absolutely LOVED that movie.  It was a book written by Charles Dickens, but I had never heard of it before.  Our teenaged son and daughter loved it, too.  I am excited to find good, clean movies with heroic deeds and a solid, moral message in the end.

So I went in search of the DVD to add it to our collection so that we could watch it whenever we wanted to and also wanted to send one to my parents.  What I found was that Nicholas Nickleby by itself was only offered as an ""Anniversary Edition"" and cost around $40!  I stumbled across this 2-pack for regular DVD price ($17-ish I think).

I have yet to watch Jack the Giant Killer (and truthfully, it seems like a strange combination) - but my parents did start to watch it.  They reported that it is an old black and white film and wasn't that great, mom fell asleep.",1414627200,7,893,4.242603550295858

8527500,4,B008FYZHJC,Love Nicholas Nickleby although I wouldn't have grouped it with the second movie at all. Worth the price though.,1460678400,,112,4.947368421052632
8527501,5,B008FYZHJC,"I bought this for Nicholas Nickleby, though Jack the Giant Killer was an amusing little aside.  This Dickens story is played with lots of feeling by a clean cut, well dressed, handsome younger Charlie Hunnan.  However, Jamie Bell and Christopher Plummer almost steal the show except for competition from Nathan Lane, Jim Broadbent, and Edward Fox, among others.  An actor I like and would like to see in more films is Nicholas Rowe; the small part he played was done with his usual mastery of speech tone and body language.  The novel is too long and involved to produce scene by scene, but this version does a good job.

The version of this with only Nicholas Nickleby has more special features.  If you're interested in just watching the movie and not going into cast interviews, director commentaries, etc., then this two-film product is the one for you.",1458000000,,857,4.795918367346939
