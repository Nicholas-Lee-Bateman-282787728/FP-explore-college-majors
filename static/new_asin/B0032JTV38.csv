4060357,1,B0032JTV38,"Absolutely unwatchable by anyone with an IQ over about 50. The plot is as thin as the actresses tops, and the acting makes B-rated Bollywood look like high Shakesperian drama. If you're watching it for more than 5 minutes, its most likely for the softcore. Since the blood and gore is laughable CG (ridiculously over-done, poorly executed CG blood splashes every time anyone get stabbed - which is about 5 people per second).

Some shows are campy, some are poorly done, and some are downright insulting. This one might be all 3.",1518825600,,529,4.75

4060359,5,B0032JTV38,"When you talk about Spartacus, from the point of view of history, you have a problem.  There is, in fact, very little known about him.  The Romans wrote down VERY little about him.  We don't even know if Spartacus was his real name.  We know he started a slave revolt and the Romans both hated him and feared him.  But then they were a slave society - their greatest fear was slaves breaking their chains and revolting.
So a show on Spartacus has a LOT of leeway when it comes to showing the story - because there are only a few details they NEED to get right.  The rest they can fill up with guesswork.  It wasn't like HBO's ROME, in which many viewers and historians debated how accurate each dress, event, and character was to real Roman history.  Spartacus can be accurate in the outfits, mostly, and the norms, mostly, and the over all story, mostly, because many of the details of the man in the title is in conflict.  Nobody can even agree from WHERE he came from or which tribe he was a member of!
So Starz added some great actors and actresses, lots of sex and violence, and focused on telling a good story in the first season without even knowing if they were going to have more seasons.  They went ALL out.  As a fan of Roman history, history in general, and Lucy Lawless, I finally decided to see the first season of this show (and I even have the second one someplace).  The show is five stars our of five and worth a look.
Unlike many DVD sets of today this set is like an earlier DVD set.  In other words, a ton of commentaries and extras like the DVD sets use to have.  So the DVD set, while it kind of looks cheap, will also be given five out of five stars.",1513555200,,1674,4.206896551724138

4060378,1,B0032JTV38,"4 stars this has to be good....NOT. A few good actors such as the main character, but mostly over-acting or milk toast characters. Graphics are interesting though much appears to be short-cutting the story. Animated blood-spattering, repetitive base vulgar expletives, and trite human drama don't cut it. The bar has been set high by the many great binge-worthy sagas. This isn't one of them.",1506729600,,392,5.140625

4060380,1,B0032JTV38,"""Spartacus: Blood and Sand"" was written for a bunch of socially stunted boys who live in their moms basement. ""Blood,"" but not much ""Sand."" Terrible dialogue. Slo-mo to burn up time during fight scenes but none during sex scenes, to hurry past the lack of chemistry! I watched half the first episode and turned it off. The writing was childish and nothing but gratuitous violence, with some bland sex. Shallow character development. Husband and wife had no chemistry. Poorly choreographed sex, but no sense of connection between them. I was looking for a fully developed story where Id care about the characters. This aint it! It shoud be called ""Spartacus: Blood and Not Much Else.""

I have no idea if these people are good actors, the script did such a job of hiding the fact.",1504396800,,778,4.762962962962963

4060390,1,B0032JTV38,"After painfully watching the first episode, I am surprised this show has such a high IMDB rating, which I usually trust.  It is surprisingly boring.  There is very little character development.  It is full of extremely poor writing:  crass one-liners worthy of a haughty and provincial 12-year-old.  Much expense has been given to computer graphics, but it is not artfully executed so comes across more like a video game, and the slow motion seems to fill time that the story cannot hold since it is so weak.  I hope to get through a few more episodes to ensure I am not judging too quickly.  Perhaps it turns around.  How else could it have lasted so many seasons?",1499558400,,665,4.6239316239316235

The whole idea of 'Spartacus' was to tell the story of the Christians led by Spartacus in a rebellion against the super power Rome at that time, by fighting there way to freedom as Gladiators, Not by SCREWING!!!! their brains out and putting on a ""Ladies Night Strip Show"" every thursday night which is common now days and has been ever since I can remember.",1481241600,,530,4.418367346938775

Blu Ray Review - 4/5
(4 discs)
Excellent package design. A collection of nine brief featurettes. The best are: ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand' -- Behind the Scenes"" a general overview of the series and its construction, cast and crew sharing their thoughts on themes, the evolution of the series, visual effects, costumes and props, historical accuracy and the gladiator boot-camp.""Grime & Punishment: The Hole"" Explores shooting in one of the show's most disgusting set pieces.

4060590,4,B0032JTV38,"The beginning of the Spartacus arrived on time and was in great condition.  This movie follows the gladiators and the aristocrats in ancient Greece.  This is an entertaining movie, but it is chock full of sexual and violent situations.  It is not made for young eyes.  The story leaves you wanting more.  The costumes and scenery seem as though they are directly from the period of time in which the show is based.  I would recommend to others.

4060762,5,B0032JTV38,"RIP Andy Whitfield.  You are greatly missed.  I love this series.  I overheard a conversation about Blood and Sand on the subway and thought I should check it out.  As a student of history I was not disappointed.  A little artistic license here and there, but it is entertainment so...  Some say Blood and Sand is aimed at a certain demographic, mainly male. Is it a guy show? Yes I would say so, but as a women I thoroughly enjoyed it and was not offended at all. Considering what we know about Ancient Rome and the sexual mores of the time, what we see being depicted is spot on.  I love ancient Roman history, so watching Spartacus was like being transported back in time and walking the ancient streets of Capua. The CGI is mind blowing, very 300, and the sets are fantastic. The acting kind of borders on campy sometimes, but it adds to the entertainment factor.  History can sometimes be boring and bland so shaking things up can move a story along.  A word to the wise, while Spartacus is highly entertaining and a great story, it is ABSOLUTELY NOT a family show.  Anyone under 18 should not be allowed to view it.  The violence, nudity and sex are GRAPHIC.  I agree with my fellow reviewer, ADULTS ONLY.  I cannot stress this enough.  Kudos to Starz for an interesting take on a fascinating historical figure.",1459036800,,1317,4.5021097046413505

I've watched Spartacus: Gods of the Arena and Blood and Sand multiple times. This is adult entertainment at its best. The look and feel are unlike any other series I can recall except Rome, which is another great series.

I devour fiction, especially fantasy and science fiction. If you like sci-fi you might like a couple of space race shows. I spent a month on a space race binge. First I read Space by James A. Michener. Then I watched two movies, The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), and then two great series, From Earth to the Moon (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015). Theyre a great combination.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,1932,5.239482200647249
