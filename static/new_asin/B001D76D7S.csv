8292010,3,B001D76D7S,"I have always enjoyed the Mexican horror flicks of the 50's and 60's, and grew up watching many of these on TV courtesy of K. Gordon Murray, who was responsible for bringing many of these films to the US.  But I never had seen anything with Chabelo Y Pepito, which actually came out in the 70's, and I was intrigued.  Very disappointing to find that the only US releases were in Spanish only with no subtitles, so I had to get an import in order to watch this.

Chabelo is Javier Lopes, a 40-year old man playing a child, complete with a child's voice.  The deal is that he's ""over-developed"".  Well, maybe physically. And, he's always eating, some kind of hormone problem, apparently. Pepito is actually a child.  At any rate, they go camping with their Boy Scout troup and encounter a cave full of monsters, and become lost, and of course the rest of the troop comes to their rescue.

This is entertaining in a strange way.  I really can't describe it well but it's kind of ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" meets ""Monster Squad"", with maybe a dash of Abbott and Costello, with a Mexican spin on things.  Supposedly this was intended as a family film but the subtitles seem to indicate otherwise at times.  I do know most of the bad words in Spanish but I was so busy trying to keep up with the subtitles I did not catch what was actually spoken at times, so I can't vouch for the accuracy of the subtitles.  I'm relatively sure that family fare in Mexico is about the same as family fare elsewhere in the world though and generally does not contain words like ""bitch"" and ""a**hole"".  I could be wrong, though.  ANYWAY that didn't bother me, I just was surprised that this was supposedly family fare but some of what was said seemed to indicate otherwise.

I've now satisfied my curiosity about Chabelo Y Pepito though.  It's decent silly fun but unfortunately, finding it with subtitles is a bit costly so I am not rushing out to find the other two films with these two characters.  3 out of 5 stars.",1272499200,2,2005,4.467032967032967
