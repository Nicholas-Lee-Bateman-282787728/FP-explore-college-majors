979171,4,6305128960,"If it were not for Whit Stillman -- the producer, writer and director of The Last Days of Disco -- I might have completely lost faith in original American filmmaking. As it is, he is my favorite living American director.  His films show his tight grasp on the lost art of dialogue and repartee,  and his characters are lively with the wit he infuses in them. When The  Jazz Singer was released in 1927 it set the modern stage with talking  pictures; in the `90s a talkie could be anything that Whit Stillman has  written.
TLDOD is the story of six upper class college graduates finding  their way in life among the disco clubs of the early `80s. Charlotte (Kate  Beckinsale) and Alice (Chlo Sevigny) knew each other at college and  ruminate on their marriage prospects among the enthusiasts (""I could  never go out with someone in advertising"" Charlotte declares.) There  is Des (Chris Eigeman) who is manager of an exclusive club in N.Y. and his  advertising executive-in-training buddy, Jimmy (MacKenzie Astin), who  constantly brings his clients to the club to impress them. Later on, Josh  (Matthew Keeslar) shows up as the young A.D.A. who had a manic depressive  experience in college.
Charlotte eventually ends up with what she  despises, Jimmy, and Alice tries her hand with Tom (Robert Sean Leonard),  an environmental lawyer. After a one-night stand where she used a few  patented lines Charlotte suggested he confronts her wide-eyed that he  loathes the dating and mating game that they have played and thinks her  somewhat slutty. She did it for image and to stay in the ""in""  crowd and got burned.
Ms. Beckinsale plays Charlotte to a tee as the  pretty friend who is self-absorbed and catlike in her admonishments to  Alice: she says matter-of-factly that she would be considered cuter than  Alice by ""most standards"" and, after Alice declines an alcoholic  beverage, inquires in front of everyone if Alice has contracted a venereal  disease. Chris Eigeman is his wonderfully sardonic self (his pairings with  Stillman make him not unlike Lynch/MacLachlan or Truffaut/Laud in  memorable collaborations) and fleshes out Des as the smarmy cad that he is.
In the best scene I witnessed this year there was a roundtable  discussion of the merits of Lady and the Tramp by all the key players. From  Alice finally finding and asserting her voice and Des sticking up for the  redemptive qualities of Tramp, to Josh agreeing with Alice it is a  priceless bit of filmmaking. Only later on does the film turn to a more  serious note -- where you see the ugliness of the drug scene for instance--  but the complex story and excellent visual prose overshadow the fringe  thematic elements. Though I loathe disco music Stillman crafts one of the  best films of this year and creates a memorable movie. As one of the  players proclaims about disco: ""As you'll remember, for many years  there was none.""  Thank god.",917222400,3,2913,4.857433808553972
979172,2,6305128960,"Let me say first, that I have not seen ""Metropolitan"" or ""Barcelona"".  Therefore, it seems as if I have joined the middle of a conversation at a dinner party of which the subject is a  mystery.
What I do know is the characters in ""Disco"" have  absolutely no redeeming qualities!  They are a group of pretentious,  selfish twinks who care for nothing except who they have to trample to get  what they want.  Stillman is asking for too much suspension of disbelief  from the viewer as he expects one to accept that such emotionless, stiff,  orchestrated dialogue takes place spontaneously in real life.  Except for  Kate Beckinsdale (a treat in ""Cold Comfort Farm""), the actors in  this film appear as if they have simply memorized a couple of pages from  the script, and shot the corresponding scene five minutes  later.
Beckinsdale's psychologial manipulation of her rooommate is an  interesting sub-plot to watch develop, but by the end of the film, for  which I grew more and more impatient,  I began to wish for an automobile  accident or meteor from ""Armageddon"" to kill them all!",911260800,,1084,4.798913043478261

979622,4,6305128960,"One of my favorite movies.  I loved all the characters, regardless of their youth and how insipid they were.  Alice Kinnon/Chlo Sevigny is herald as the moral center of the film, the secret lust of ALL the males, though she is rigid, serious, seemingly sad, and does not seem witty at all.  She is bookish and intelligent, shy and very earnest.

Her roommate and rival is Charlotte Pringress, played with delicious aplomb by the magnetic Kate Beckinsale, who exhibits a perfect chic American accent.  Charlotte is gorgeous, articulate, sharp.  She is jealous of her attractive roommate, and sets about - almost innocently -  of ruining her.

I love the feel of the film.  The characters are up and comers, who will eventually rule the world, but you get them while they are young, pert, confident, flawed, but embolden by conceit and youth.  They can live in New York, be further financed by their parents, pursue amusing jobs, and there is no doubt, less because of their ability and more because of their certainty, they will succeed.  They are not afraid of anything.

Love really everything about the film.  The actors/characters are great.  Mortality hits them, but they are not deterred, more arrogant than ever.  The performances are flawless.  Great entertaining era piece.",1441670400,2,1281,4.971698113207547

979797,5,6305128960,"The Last Days of Disco is a dramedy that was loosely based on the events of the nightclubs in Manhattan - including Studio 54 - during the disco scene of New York City during the early 80's. It stars Chlo Sevigny and Kate Beckinsale,

The story centers on Alice Kinnon and Charlotte Pingress,two young Manhattan professionals fresh out of college who work in a New York publishing house. They frequent a local disco house together in search of music,dance and romance. Both have different personalities with Alice being intelligent,quiet and soft-spoken while Charlotte being outgoing,conceited and giving Alice constant advice. The film follow the events that both women experiences especially during the last days of the disco scene.

This is definitely a great movie about the disco era. It was a sincere and earnest depiction of the scene as well as that of friendship between two strikingly different women. Definitely,well- done with great dialogue and outstanding performances from Sevigny and Beckinsale. Also,worth mentioning is the outstanding soundtrack particularly I'm Coming Out by Diana Ross.

Arguably Whit Stillman's best, 'Last Days' is a delightful comedy chronicling the lives of recent college grads aspiring to join the New York intelligentsia professionally as book editors and socially through meaningful social interaction found in the most surprising of places--disco nightclubs.

There is no plot really and it is one of those real life Art films,- Drama! but Not too much drama- and lots of Characters like one would have seen at STUDIO 54 .To the Filmmakers credit is hard sometimes to realize it was about the early 80's since nothing looks particularly dated.

979947,3,6305128960,"As you can see the reviews for this are all over the map.  Some love it, some hate it.  I am pretty neutral toward the movie.  It is based loosely on the demise of studio 54.  To the extent that there is a plot, it revolves around a group of people that work and/or hang out at an exclusive NY club in the early 1980s.  Like the real Studio 54 the club is being investigated and is ultimately raided.

The problem with the movie it is tries to base the story around the characters, none of whom do much of anything or are all that likeable.  They mainly sit and talk, go to the club, then talk some more, go back to the club, hook up, then talk more.  The movie had a group of talented actors (most of whom were still relatively young at the time), but it did not give them great material to work with and as a result the movie just seemed to lag.  To me it is the kind of movie you can have on in the background while you are doing other things and still know everything about it.

Although this was the last of writer/director Whit Stillman's trilogy [""Metropolitan"" (1990) and Barcelona (1994)], chronologically it fits between the two.  In the early 1980's, the disco era was beginning to ebb but the Park Avenue yuppies continue their swinging ways in this film.  Des (Chris Eigeman) is a manager at one of the hottest clubs in New York where admittance is only for the cool as determined by a Nazi-like doorman who wields his power with gusto.  Des allows his ad-exec. friend Jimmy (Mackenzie Astin) to slip in the back door with his not-so-cool clients.  This is frowned upon and sets up a conflict down the road.

In another set-up, two co-workers and one time college classmates, Charlotte (Kate Beckinsale) and Alice (Chloe Sevigny) agree to get a weirdly configured apartment along with another friend, Holly (Tara Subkoff).  Along with an assistant DA, Josh (Matt Keeslar) and Dan (Matthew Ross), the collective gather at various spots to chit chat about life.  Snarky Charlotte somehow manages to put everybody down including her supposed friend, virginal Alice.  At the club, shy Alice pairs up with a not so innocent, but nice guy Tom (Robert Sean Leonard).  Using advice from the more worldly Charlotte, Alice manages to easily seduce Tom who then believes that Alice is a borderline slut.  In a humorous follow-up scene they discuss whether she was actually a virgin before their dalliance.  She isn't sure because her only other experience involved a partner who ""squirted"" but never made it inside.  Tom says ""he's pretty sure some part of ""it"" must get inside to remove the virgin label.

In another great scene Josh and Des argue about the children's movie, ""Lady and the Tramp.""  Stillman's writing is at its best here as Josh insists that ""Tramp"" was just a no good womanizer and that ""Lady"" would do well by looking elsewhere, stable ""Scotti"" for example.  After defending ""Tramp"" in the argument, Des eventually says he didn't necessarily disagree but somebody needed to defend the scoundrel.  Great stuff.  Ultimately this film will have a small but loyal following.  For those of us who appreciate films that are honest, relevant and well written this is a good one.

This Criterion Blu ray is a step up from the DVD but not a big step in terms of the video quality.  The transfer is 1080p and the film has an aspect ratio of 1.78:1.  Overall the colors seem less vibrant than what I would expect.  There are occasional contrast and brightness variations as well.  Most won't notice any of this unless you're using a large display.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is excellent.  There are numerous scenes in the clubs where this is clearly evident.  Nice uses of the surrounds, but the dialog heavy film doesn't miss a word even in a noisy environment.  Extras include a trailer, 4 deleted scenes, a featurette, readings from the book by Stillman, production stills, commentary by Stillman and a couple of the actors and a critical essay.",1343520000,8,3016,4.883858267716535
980132,5,6305128960,"Whit Stillman's 1998 film ""The Last Days of Disco"" remains one of his best pictures - a refreshing, intelligent, and often subtly hilarious look at shallow yuppies living, clubbing, and loving at the tail end of the Disco era (i.e. ""the very early 1980s""). The demure Chloe Sevigny and the bitchy Kate Beckinsale play a vastly different pair of publishing assistants who decide to room in a New York railroad apartment while they hit the highlife at night with a colorful group of supporting characters -- not the least of which include advertising man Mackenzie Astin (who needs the disco to attract clients), club bouncer Chris Eigeman (a Stillman regular), and assistant district attorney Matt Keeslar (who perhaps has both the hots for Sevigny, and ulterior motives for visiting the disco himself).

The performances are uniformly on target, each character believably echoing the frivolous nature of the music, but also the genuine feeling for the time and place they do share. Stillman provides seemingly every character with a vital scene or line of dialogue, and comes down hard on their essentially materialistic ideals while never condemning them or turning the picture into a broadly comic spoof. Sevigny's character, in particular, is a credible portrait of a young girl lost in the big city, emotionally if nothing else, and Beckinsale creates one of the most effectively obnoxious (but believable!) women you're ever likely to see on the big screen, years before the actress dedicated most of her time to becoming a plastic action figure.

They all speak Stillman's prose, which is funny, insightful and hip, making ""The Last Days of Disco"" engaging and fun, filled with an enjoyable soundtrack, while the director handles each turn -- dramatic and (predominantly) comic -- with an unabashed love for the era. It may not have a gigantic, thought-provoking point, but then again, neither did the early '80s.

Criterion's Blu-Ray of ""The Last Days of Disco"" is basically a HD reprise of their 2009 DVD edition, with the added surplus of an excellent 1080p AVC encoded transfer and DTS MA soundtrack. Extras include a commentary from Stillman, Sevigny and Eigeman; four deleted scenes; the trailer, a behind-the-scenes featurette, stills gallery, and an audio recording of Stillman reading a chapter from his book ""The Last Days of Disco, with Cocktails at Petrossian Afterwards.""",1342051200,21,2390,5.170542635658915

980134,5,6305128960,"This is a tough film for some people. It is not for the action adventure crowd who always want their characters rather flat and racing to catch up with the plot or the laugh a minute crowd. Otherwise it's really a fine film. It's a comedy of manners. The audience can at least relate to one of a collection of characters in this film who are struggling to find the right person. Witty exchange is more valued than the plot in the world around them. People usually speak their minds and on occasion they hold their tongues and over the course of the film we learn why we like them and dislike them. We can also relate to their mistakes and troubles. There are no spoilers for this sort of film. It concerns characters in search of happiness and in the end they got what they deserved. This is a structurally simple, well-shaped comedy that you can repeatedly watch.

The only thing that you really need know about the plot concerns the oncoming fall of disco and the club. First, the club is being jointly investigated by the IRS and the DA. Bernie owns the club. Des is a manager at the club. Jimmy and Josh are his friends. Des is a real womanizer at the start of the film. He drops women when he announces to them that the relationship can't go any further now that he's come to the conclusion that he's gay. Jimmy works for an ad agency and the IRS is a big client. Jimmy's boss, aware of his friendship with Des,is leaning on him to get their IRS and DA into the club or he'll lose his job. Josh works for the prosecutor's office. The DA like the IRS, is quite interested in the club for drugs rather than unreported income. Josh and his colleagues search for evidence at the club. Once they have accumulated enough evidence the club will be raided.

While there are numerous female characters only two really matter. Charlotte and Alice have an unstable relationship. They work at the same publishing firm and ever since they met in college Charlotte has been letting the air out of Alice's tires. There's a terrific scene in the nightclub when Charlotte is puzzled why Alice isn't drinking then recalls the drug on her bureau and informs everybody in front of Alice that she has the clap! Charlotte like Dez has a big ego and is often competing with Alice over men. They also discover that they wind up with the wrong man,somebody a bit more suitable for the other woman.

At night they form a social group at the disco club and pair off into couples. The group varies on occasion but Dez, Josh, Charlotte and Alice are the lead characters. Jimmy and Tom are strong support characters but they strike out with the women. Charlotte is stunned when Jimmy wants to break off their relationship. Tom gives Charlotte, a virgin, the clap and she learns about his wife. One night the conversation about the film, The Lady and the Tramp, takes place with Josh and Alice on one side of the discussion while Charlotte and Dez oppose them. Josh's reading of Lady and Tramp is almost an indictment of the behavior of Dez and Charlotte. Lady is light-headed and irresponsible. Tramp will stay a tramp. Josh contends that they will never change!

In the end people recognize that the problem is finding a good fit. Alice is furious when Charlotte walks off with Jimmy but after she gets to know him she's relieved that Charlotte got stuck with him. Jimmy is sorry too. He could never see himself as a part of Charlotte's life and to her amazement he walks out on her. On the other hand this is no problem with Dez who thrives on big dreams and can eagerly take a piece of the action. Alice values honesty in her men and gets along best with others who do so. Otherwise her discretion is constantly tested and simply easier at times if she shuts up.

If you've seen My Dinner with Andre or My Night with Maud dialogue is quite important. So I can understand why Stillman chose the disco club for the background for so many scenes. It seemed like all of New York's night life gathered here for a while. Stillman probably put the naked woman into the film for an R rating. It's not for kids. They would easily grow bored with a film about the struggle to find the right person for your life. Without question it's better seen without commercial interuption so buy the DVD. Michael Weatherly from NCIS also puts in an appearance. He's one of the people that Jimmy sneaks into the club and who works with Josh in the DA's office. He and Josh later lead the raid on the club.",1336089600,2,4461,4.4486552567237165
980135,5,6305128960,"The title will undoubtedly put people of elevated sensibility on high alert but their wariness is unwarranted: this is the wittiest and most literate movie of the past twenty years - fully capable of taxing even the most rarefied of sensibilities.

I first saw it on TV a few years back and it immediately stood out from the general morass; it struck me as the only movie I'd seen that matched the Harold Pinter adaptation of Simon Gray's ""Butley"" for incisiveness of dialogue. In fact, it surpassed that brilliant screenplay for consistency and continuity of wit as ""Butley"" had a number of arid patches amongst the overall fecundity.

Not that it has much ""plot"". If your chief requirement of a movie is ""what happens"" then this won't fit the bill. Not much ""happens"". What matters is the talk. Like ""Seinfeld"", although this is even sharper and more precisely-aimed than that superb series, this talk inhabits a world of its own. ""Seinfeld"" was signalled out for its ""Seinfeld Situations"" - outlandish goings on that were supposedly the distinguishing features of the show. This was a mistake; what was unique about the show was not the situations as such but how Jerry and Elaine and George and Kramer TALKED about them. And ""Last Days"" is the same; like ""Seinfeld"" it's obsessed with both self and minutiae (which in their cases are possibly the same thing) but its vocabulary is a sort of legalese. Most of the characters are Ivy League graduates (some are lawyers) and they discuss everything in the language of distinctions without differences - an odd combination of abstraction and precision. The ""Lady is a Tramp"" debate is the most well-known example in this movie but I thought that was the one time the writer stretched the ironic juxtapositions a bit too far; elsewhere they're more naturally founded and even funnier.

Performances are excellent with Kate Beckinsale as an arch-bitch being particularly effective. And yes, I enjoyed the music too; Chic's ""Le Freak"" and ""Good Times"" being irresistible despite my most earnest endeavours to contain my enthusiasm. Disco music only seems to really come to life with the appropriate visual complement and this movie provides the look of early-80s decadence with aplomb: it looks terrific. So if you despair at the idiocy of most current movie offerings I can only prompt you not to miss this one.",1322611200,4,2359,4.937027707808564
980136,1,6305128960,"Ok, here's some mind-blowing news that the director might not have figured out. Disco was an African American and gay music. Another fact that he might not know - Studio 54 was run by a Jewish homosexual. Fact # 3 - you can't have a long conversation in a New York City club because it's too loud to hear anything you say. You have to shout everything and the best you can hope for is a nod and a smile before it becomes too unbearable for words.

Yet somehow Stillman decided to portray disco in the same way he portrayed Upper East Side private club like a salon like environment peopled almost exclusively by wealthy white people pontificating on nonsense and cartoons, all the while wonder if their upper class white privilege is justified (short answer - why yes it is). There's some disco playing, but it's happily playing at low volumes in the background just so you know that it's about disco. There's not much of a story here but what passes for a sub-plot is stolen whole cloth from the travails of Studio 54 including the unfortunate hubris that would lead the club owners to brag about all the money they were ferreting away from the IRS that would lead to a raid that would find that money and the cocaine.

What ultimately kills this movie is the fact that it's unbearably dull. No one has any passion or interest beyond talking about trivialities (the Scrooge McDuck conversation gets heavy rotation) and in the end, one of the bland characters says that disco is really fun and great. And then they go on the subway and start dancing the white man's overbite.

Metropolitan has its charms despite being about people I normally find repugnant but this thing is just a sad little attempt to expand past the Upper East Side in that white racist fantasy of what New York could be like - if only the minorities weren't everywhere.",1319328000,6,1841,4.555891238670695
980137,1,6305128960,"I fell madly and very happily in love with Whit Stillman's Barcelona. I couldn't stop laughing from start to finish. After watching it I went on a quest to see all of his films. I patiently watched The Last Days of Disco and kept waiting for it to get interesting. It never did.

The story revolves around early twenty-somethings seeking sex and romance through the ending phase of New York's infamous Studio 54. The movie is flop in every way. The characters are two-dimensional caricatures. There is no one to relate to in a any vital way. The dialog is mechanically witty, delivered in meaningless monologues. There wasn't a speck of realism or humanity in The Last Days of Disco that I had found in Metropolitan and Barcelona. I can't tell if this was supposed to be a comedy since I didn't laugh once.

If you're looking for a vapid nostalgia piece using Studio 54 as a center piece, this is the movie for you. Unlike Stillman's other films, I found it devoid of any humanity. The actors are shells. The dialog is dead. The camera work is flat. This may be what happens to a gifted film maker when he is funded and pressured by larger production houses. I hope Whit Stillman makes more films, but not like this. It is a horrible waste of time.",1315440000,4,1248,4.493392070484582
980138,4,6305128960,"The last of the yuppie trilogy from Whit Stillman is the least of the three, but it has its moments.  For starters, it has the same very bright dialogue that characterizes Metropolitan and, especially, Barcelona as well.  My favorite of the three is Barcelona, so one of my favorite moments in Disco is when Jimmy, the fired ad man, runs across Ted, the square adman from Barcelona, who is both pestered and changed by Fred (the same actor -- Chris Eigeman -- who plays Des here), who offers to set Jimmy up with interviews in Barcelona.  That casual cross-referencing and inside jokes among the three films account in part for both their appeal and the slight hint of annoyance that I felt in much of Disco.  Anyway, the Lady and the Tramp discussion is a laugh, as is the great quick scene where Des sniffs his coffee on hearing that it has the same active ingredient as cocaine.  In the end though, good riddance to disco, no loss at all, but Disco makes for an entertaining two hour journey back to the early 80s (which of course look much better in the film than they actually were in New York).",1298764800,,1100,4.48
980280,5,6305128960,"Somehow I got intrigued by The Last Days of Disco by writer, director, and producer Whit Stillman. I saw it in the video section of the Bakersfield Library, and kept thinking that someday I would check it out--but then when I got up the gumption to really do it, it was gone! I kept checking and rechecking on its status until finally it was back. I rushed home to watch it and despite all the hype--albeit self-induced--I was not disappointed. It exceeded my expectations. Compare and contrast it to 54, with Mike Meyers, Ryan Phillippe, and Salma Hayek, because it tells a similar story, focusing on a nightclub at the height and end of the disco era. The disco itself is the central character in both films, and both are brought down by the decadence of the era, and also for tax evasion. The story in both cases is told through the eyes of a group of people who either work at or frequent the discos.

I like both films, but TLDOD prevailed. Whit Stillman has only written, directed, and produced 3 films so far--besides TLDOD, Barcelona and Metropolitan--both are similar to TLDOD in that they all start off as a comedy of manners but progress to a more dramatic story once the quirky characters have been established.

All three films star the quirky and enigmatic Chris Eigeman. You may not know who he is unless you are a fan of the films of Whit Stillman, as he was in all three of those, but he was on The Gilmore Girls and I first noticed him in commercials for  Pacific Bell where he created a very memorable character who always wore a dark suit and tie, no matter how inappropriate the situation. Though he seemed smart and witty, you got the feeling he probably still lived in his mother's basement. It was uncanny how he could convey so much in such a short segment. He was the forerunner of the ""can you hear me now?"" guy.

In TLDOD he was Des McGrath, who worked at the disco in his spare time when he wasn't dumping women by pretending to be gay. You might think at the start that you would be rooting for Jimmy (Mackenzie Astin), who works at an ad agency, and whose major responsibility was getting their clients into the disco. Or perhaps the handsome Tom Platt, an environmental lawyer who collects Scrooge McDuck comics. He is played by Robert Sean Leonard (Peter M&uuml;ller in Swing Kids).

--------------------
Tom Platt: Actually, there's one theory that the environmental movement of our day was sparked by the re-release of Bambi in the late 1950s.
===============

You never would have guessed that Assistant District Attorney Josh Neff (Matt Keeslar), who is sickeningly sincere in his love of Disco, yet is instrumental in bringing the whole temple crashing down on everyone's heads, would emerge as the most sympathetic of the men; followed by the ""smarmy braggart of the most obnoxious kind"" not to mention ""all-around sleaze ball,"" Des McGrath. In one key scene Josh Neff analyzes the social ramifications of the Disney classic ""Lady and the Tramp"" thusly:

----------------
Josh Neff: [referring to Lady and the Tramp] There is something depressing about it, and it's not really about dogs. Except for some superficial bow-wow stuff at the start, the dogs all represent human types, which is where it gets into real trouble. Lady, the ostensible protagonist, is a fluffy blond Cocker Spaniel with absolutely nothing on her brain. She's great-looking, but - let's be honest - incredibly insipid. Tramp, the love interest, is a smarmy braggart of the most obnoxious kind - an oily jailbird out for a piece of tail, or... whatever he can get.
Charlotte Pingress: Oh, come on.
Josh Neff: No, he's a self-confessed chicken thief, and all-around sleaze ball. What's the function of a film of this kind? Essentially as a primer on love and marriage directed at very young people, imprinting on their little psyches the idea that smooth-talking delinquents recently escaped from the local pound are a good match for nice girls from sheltered homes. When in ten years the icky human version of Tramp shows up around the house, their hormones will be racing and no one will understand why. Films like this program women to adore jerks.
===============

Josh Neff also had a mental breakdown in his past and now must maintain his even keel with lithium, but still, in spite of his put down of a beloved Disney icon, he emerges as the strongest candidate. Des defends Tramp, and even though there is more than a bit of the tramp about him, he still has a certain amount of raffish charm.

The real lead, though, is Alice Kinnon (Chlo Sevigny), who works at a publishing house and has ambitions to be an editor, or at least an assistant editor, instead of a mere editor's assistant. She is smart but listens too much to the bad advice of her friend Charlotte Pingress (Kate Beckinsale). Charlotte embodies all that is wrong with that selfish Disco era, of those who strove to be yuppies, though assistants weren't really professionals, no more than were nightclub flunkies like Des. She professes to be Alice's friend, but she is a forerunner of what would come to be known as the ""frenemy."" Charlotte tells Alice that she is coming off like too much of a strict kindergarten teacher, and to counteract that, she should work the word ""sexy"" into the conversation at every opportunity. This gives off a very bad impression and leads to dating disaster when she falsely confesses that she thinks that Scrooge McDuck is sexy. In another scene Charlotte blurts out that Alice must have VD, but this could also be beneficial in counteracting her stuffy image. Chlo Sevigny and Kate Beckinsale shine in their respective roles, especially Chlo Sevigny, who since her debut in Kids has consistently been on the cutting edge of independent film, and has since crossed over to the mainstream after her Oscar nomination for Boys Don't Cry.

Also worthy of mention in small but pivotal roles, Michael Weatherly was Hap, an ad agency client that Jimmy sneaked in through the back door. Michael Weatherly is now Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo (186 episodes, 2003-2011) in the popular TV show NCIS. Jaid Barrymore was the Disco Tiger Lady, who always appeared in jungle print fabric. This is Drew Barrymore's actual mother! Jennifer Beals, who was star Flashdancer by night/welder by day Alex Owens in Flashdance (1983) plays one of Des McGrath's disco discards. Brilliant stunt casting. Burr Steers, who played enforcer of the Disco's door policy and Des McGrath's nemesis, Van, is actually the nephew of both Jackie O. and Gore Vidal, as well as an ancestor of Aaron Burr, the man who killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel. His uncle Gore Vidal wrote a book of  `historical fiction' entitled Burr, that focused on his nephew's namesake's role in the founding of our country. After playing Roger, AKA ""Flock of Seagulls"" in Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Steers went on to distinguish himself on the other side of the camera as a director of such films as 17 Again and Charlie St. Cloud, both with Zac Efron, and Igby Goes Down, starring Kieran Culkin.

The bottom line is that The Last Days of Disco is an undiscovered gem of a film that sums up the good, the bad, and the ugly fashions of the Disco era and its demise. Tightly written and brimming with wit, Whit Stillman has created a brilliant film that combines the independent film spirit with young upwardly-mobile professionalism.

The soundtrack contains all the great hits of that era, like ""He's the Greatest Dancer"" by Sister Sledge, ""Shame"" by  Evelyn ""Champagne"" King, ""Good Times,"" ""Le Freak,"" and ""Everybody Dance"" by Chic, ""More, More, More (Pt. 1)"" by Andrea True Connection, ""The Tide Is High"" and ""Heart of Glass"" by Blondie, ""I'm Coming Out"" by Diana Ross, ""Got to Be Real"" by Cheryl Lynn, ""Turn the Beat Around"" by Vicki Sue Robinson, ""I Love the Nightlife (Disco 'Round)"" by Alicia Bridges, ""Love Train"" by The O'Jays, and even an acapella version of ""Amazing Grace"" by a surprisingly good Kate Beckinsale.

It all adds up to a great comedy of manners that is also an accurate historical document of an era that we can look back on with a mixture of nostalgia and relief now that it's over. Josh Neff sums it up thusly:

-------------
Josh Neff: Disco will never be over. It will always live in our minds and hearts. Something like this, that was this big, and this important, and this great, will never die. Oh, for a few years - maybe many years - it'll be considered pass&eacute; and ridiculous. It will be misrepresented and caricatured and sneered at, or - worse - completely ignored. People will laugh about John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, white polyester suits and platform shoes and people going like *this*
[strikes disco pose]
Josh Neff: ,but we had nothing to do with those things and still loved disco. Those who didn't understand will never understand: disco was much more, and much better, than all that. Disco was too great, and too much fun, to be gone forever! It's got to come back someday. I just hope it will be in our own lifetimes.
[Des, Charlotte, Dan, and Van stare at Josh like he's crazy]
Josh Neff: ...Sorry, I've got a job interview this afternoon and I was just trying to get revved up, but... most of what I said, I, um... believe.

980286,5,6305128960,"With The Last Days of Disco, Whit Stillman completed his loose-knit trilogy of films about doomed Preppies in love. Much like vintage Woody Allen, the characters in Stillman's films exist in a hermetically-sealed world on the Upper East Side of New York City. His characters are affluent and well-educated but with messy relationships. Last Days of Disco sets all of this against the backdrop of the decline of the disco era. It is a testament to Stillman's skill as a filmmaker that he does this all with a fantastic sense of humor and a real affection for his characters, even the ones that aren't all that likable.

For quite some time there had been rumors that the folks at the Criterion Collection were planning a special edition of this film. Stillman had even talked it up in interviews. The previous DVD came and went rather quickly before going out-of-print, fetching steep prices on eBay, so for fans of this film it nice to have Last Days of Disco finally readily available.

There is an audio commentary by director Whit Stillman and actors Chloe Sevigny and Chris Eigeman. Stillman wastes no time diving into the origins of his film and how Winona Ryder was almost cast as Alice but her agent was slow in responding and Sevigny got the role. The actress has a charming, self-deprecating wit and points out her awkward dancing style. Eigeman says that he almost didn't do the film because the studio felt that he wasn't famous enough. He was also worried that he'd be typecast; playing a character similar to the ones he did in Stillman's two previous films. The director speaks eloquently about his interest in disco on this chatty, engaging track.

Also included are four deleted scenes with optional commentary by Stillman, Sevigny and Eigeman. There is a subplot with Jimmy (Astin) that fleshes out his feelings for Alice and Charlotte. There is also more footage of Des outside of the club. It develops his character more and is nice to see, particularly if you're a fan of Eigeman. Stillman puts the footage in context and explains why it was cut.

Stillman reads from his 2000 book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Days-of-Disco-With-Cocktails-at-Petrossian-Afterwards/dp/0374183392/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Days of Disco, With Cocktails at Petrossian Afterwards</a>, which is a novelization of the film from the point-of-view of Jimmy Steinway and also picks up after the events in the film.

A nice inclusion is a vintage featurette from the time of the film's release. This promotional material features behind-the-scenes footage and soundbites from Stillman and his cast.

""Stills Gallery"" features a collection of photographs from the film with captions written by Stillman that consist of personal recollections of making the film.

Nevertheless, Stillman continues his signature style of witty and often insightful dialogue which reflects the continuous development of his abundant and colorful characters throughout the entire movie.  On the surface, this movie is about two women in search of love at the end of the disco era.  However, you will be sorely disappointed if you are looking for a fun and light romantic comedy.  If anything, it is more about the search for a meaningful life.  In search of something more fulfilling.

Watching this movie, I was struck by the fact that no matter how quickly fashions change in the jungle-esque hubs of the capitalist world's great metropolises: clothes, clubs, music - it's all here one day but by next week its shuffled out by the next wave of whatever - the fundamental dynamics of growing out of adolescence in these places is still the same, some twenty five years on. There are still the yuppies (then it was advertising - now its consultancy or corporate law) and the idealists trying to make it in publishing yet really focusing on the golden shilling of the bestseller. Still no one is happy in their job, trying to rent a habitable apartment on a low income is still a nightmarish task, status anxiety pollutes the consciousness of young people like a cancer making contentment impossible, and relationships continue to take on the revolving door mantle in the manner they always have done.

I think all the performances are stunning, the dialogue whip smart and the direction lovely. Sevigny made me love her in this film. I also think Kate Beckinsale does a ton of heavy lifting with some mighty rapid chatter. It isn't a sympathetic part yet she makes it warm.

I'd buy a new DVD in a heartbeat. In my dreams, The Criterion Collection puts out a triptych of the Stillman films. Do see this film if you can. It is an intelligent and marvelous piece of work.

In Last Days of Disco, they weren't nice to each other but they sometimes seemed nicer than the ones in Metropolitan.  Barcelona doesn't count because it's two American guys in Spain so of course, the Spanish are nice and throw off the curve.

Employing most of the cast he previously used in Barcelona and Metropolitan, Stillman attempts to show how disco was so strong an influence on the very existences of an entire segment of a generation that its abrupt absence at the film's end leaves the characters awe-struck and uncomprehending. The disco was the very focus of their romances, their ambitions, their socializing, it was their ""scene"". Ranging from law enforcement figures who obsessively seek to bust the disco owners for money laundering and tax evasion, to drug dealers and beautiful men and women whose time off the dance floor is depicted as downtime to be gotten through, Stillman's story simply fails to reach out and take hold of the attention the way his films had in the past.

980621,4,6305128960,"The last in Whit Stillman's famous trilogy from the 90s about young preppies in love, THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO is as talky as the other two, and much more engaging than the trilogy's middle entry (BARCELONA) but not quite up to the high writing standards of his first (and best) of the three, METROPOLITAN. LAST DAYS centers primarily upon two lovely Hampshire College grads now working as assistant editors in a publishing house, the insecure Alice (Chloe Sevigny) and the hilariously annoying and straightforward Charlotte (Kate Beckinsale), and their beaux and friends in Manhattan around 1980 or so. Although the privileged and exclusive disco scene allows them a social world they had not thought possible during their time in college, they have little idea their world is crumbling beneath them. The central action of the film is a DA's drug raid on the disco they most usually frequent (where their friend Des, played by Stillman favorite Chris Eigemann, works), but the real point of ther movie is watching the characters couple, uncouple, and most of all chat. (The greatest pleasure of any Whit Stillman film is always the highly amusing dialogue.) One of the characters played by Matt Keeslar makes a spirited defense of disco at the film's conclusion when it has been popularly declared over, but there is something very odd about a film ostensibly about disco where all the major characters are white and heterosexual. Only at the film's beautiful closing sequence, when Sevigny, Keeslar, a trainload of subway passengers and a waiting platform of commuters all blissfully groove to ""Love Train"" is the utopian promise of disco even hinted at: the rest of the time we're always on the privileged side of the velvet rope, which always contradicted what disco ideally could have been about.",1156723200,3,1799,5.0200668896321075

There are some, albeit very few, interesting plot twists. But basically this movie is mostly worthy of a late night movie made by and for Cinemax. Pity too. I'm a huge Chloe Sevigny fan (and not for ""Brown Bunny"" reasons), but her talent is minimally utilized, as is that of her co-stars. I realize this movie is largely about recent college grads and their pretentious entrance into the real world, with the disco night life as a back drop. But their trials and tribulations have little to do with the disco life itself. ""The Club,"" the flick's disco night life place to be, is merely what Central Perk was to the TV show friends- a gathering place to gossip about relatively juvenile adventures in love (or reasonable facsimiles of), and their recent and up to now short durations in the working world. The minimal glances into ""The Club"" itself is archetypal. Were it not for an admittedly clever twist that explains a lot of the behavior of that disco's employees earlier in the movie, the dialogue would be largely mundane, uninspired and testing of the viewers patience. The pay off isn't rewarding enough to rescue one from that experience. Kate Beckinsale's character is the stereotyical pain in the [...], nose in her friends' business nuisance, and she plays that well. But an annoying character does not a good movie make. And for a movie of this title, the dance scenes are minimal in quantity and display. Were it not for a friend letting me borrow his copy, I wouldn't have even dropped a single dollar to rent this flick. To be fair, the soundtrack is outstanding and solely keeps one following the movie's events. But that's hardly a reason to waste a couple hours watching this film's paint dry.

By turns acerbic and heartwarming, Stillman exhibits an obvious affection for his characters even (if not especially) in their dumbest moments.

The story of two recently-graduated young women in New York during ""the very early 1980's"" revolves around the nightlife of a certain Manhattan nightclub and its patrons. Chloe Sevigny and Kate Beckinsale rise to Stillman's mannered dialogue and awkward humor, but the showstopper is stillman vet Chris Eigeman as the unscrupulous Des, a manager at the nightclub for whom ignorance of his boss's shady dealings is bliss (Des: ""To me, shipping cash to Switzerland in canvas bags suggests possible illegality."" Jimmy: ""What are you going to do?"" Des: ""Well, I'm not going into that room anymore"").

I find this film so interesting because of director Whit Stillman's explorations into the complexities of human behavior.  He shows the audience how deep and shallow all of us can be.  For example, Robert Sean Leonard and Chloe Sevigny's characters begin an engrossing discussion about the state of environmental affairs in America one minute and then in the next minute their having meaningless sex.  Ultimately, the movie seems to reflect the sexual attitudes of the time, which I think were a little misguided and self-indulgent.

Chloe Sevigny plays a recent college graduate, Alice, who works for a publishing house and who is pursued by both the disco's womanizing assistant manager, played by Chris Eigemen, and a nice but mentally ill Assistant District Attorney, played by Matt Keeslar.

The story mainly flow around the relationship between Charlotte and Alice.  Sometimes it is good.  Other times a bit stormy.  Charlotte envies ability to succede professionally and attract more desireable guys.  However Alice has deep rooted insecurities about confronting those who offend and or control her.
Other parts of this story focus around insecurities of the male actors:  Des, Jimmy, Josh, Van, and even the prima donna nightclub owner, Bernie.  Des seems to have a running line how he confesses to women that he is gay to get their sympathy and a hopeful sexual escapade.  Jimmy is oh so worreid about making impressions upon his boss and potential clients at his advertising agency job by trying to get them into the trendy night club where Van is all to happy to keep out such elements.
All these characters are intertwined in various scenes where one can certainly reminisce about those first few years after college and all the good times and heartaches that one endured.

980833,2,6305128960,"In my opinion, Whit Stillman's ""The Last Days of Disco"" is not nearly as good as the director's ""Metropolitan"" or ""Barcelona"".  The characters are not as intriguing, and the overall effect of the movie is that it does not capture the atmosphere of 1980-81 New York City.
At that time, a certain sleaze and grime pervaded the city.  It was an era of dimly-lit, crime-ridden, graffiti-covered subway trains and crime-ridden, gritty, trash-strewn streets.  There were two opposite ways in which music and culture reacted to these conditions.  The punk movement embraced the chaos of the streets.  By contrast, disco papered over the problems with nihilistic glitz and cocaine-fueled glamor.  A surface optimism covering over a deep pessimism.
Stillman's 1980-81 New York does not capture this pathos.  The New York of ""The Last Days of Disco"" resembles the more orderly city of the late 1990s and today.  Had Stillman's characters been interacting in a more true-to-life, grimy 1980 New York City - rather than a whitewashed one in which the trains are miraculously graffiti-free and the streets are clean and safe - I think the movie would have been much more compelling.",1042070400,8,1169,5.0837696335078535
980834,5,6305128960,"Director and writer Walt Stillman is on a short list of talented film makers who seem to make movies only when they want to. Stiller is forty-eight years old. Besides ""The Last Days of Disco"", he has done just two other movies - ""Metropolitan"" in 1990 and ""Barcelona"" in 1994. Whatever else he does in life must be enlightening to him. Otherwise, his film work would not be so insightful, unique and well crafted.
People like Stillman usually have another trait. They tend to explore only a very small segment of society. In his case, it is an ongoing study of upper middle-class young adults who grown up in and around New York City. Because he makes so few movies, he is in no danger of exhausting his subject matter. In fact, those who like his work can hardly wait for the next installment.
He is a gifted craftsman. He writes about his characters with a cool detachment, allowing the viewers to form their own opinions. He is a master of dialog. He successfully pulls off a difficult genre known as the comedy of manners. His humor is so cool and dry that I usually find my brain running about five seconds behind what is happening on the screen. I catch myself wanting to talk back to the characters. This, I think, is a compliment, because it indicates becoming very involved with the story.
In ""Metropolitan"", Stillman's award-winning first effort, we were treated to a ritual most of us presumed was dead. The film was about the trials and tribulations of The Coming Out Ball, as in the High Society type. ""Barcelona"" showed a group of young New Yorkers as they tried, unsuccessfully, to apply their standards to those of Spanish society. ""The Last Days of Disco"" takes place in Manhattan in the early 1980s. The decline of the disco culture is secondary here to an overall change in social values that was then sweeping the country.
The cast is uniformly excellent. While none of them are especially well known, you can expect that to change for several of them. One actor, Christopher Eigerman, has appeared in all three films. This film also makes several references to the city of Barcelona. Stillman has essentially made a movie trilogy, although each film can be enjoyed independently.
I don't think you need to have much knowledge of New York to relate to the characters and the story. Exploring one's limits and seeking one's place in the world are universal pursuits.
As I said, dialog is at the forefront in ""The Last Days of Disco"". For example, Chloe Sevigney and Kate Beckinsale play Alice and Charlotte, two roommate who could not be more different. At one point the rather icy Charlotte pushes the much warmer Alice too far. Alice walks out of the apartment, and Chloe realizes she must make amends. So, running into the hall, she gives her best shot at an apology. ""Listen! What I said that was wrong, I apologize for!"", she shouts. She hesitates a moment. Unable to face complete humility, she follows with, ""And what I said that wasn't wrong, I don't apology for!"".
Walt Stillman has created another urbane and sophisticated work.",1017273600,2,3057,4.71588785046729
980835,5,6305128960,"Directed by the amazing Whit Stillman (""Barcelona""; ""Metropolitan""), ""The Last Days of Disco"" examines the life of several young, upward, professionals (or ""yuppies"" for short) during the early 1980's, when the disco craze was dying and the Decade of Decadence was beginning.
Alice (Chlo Sevigny of ""Boys Don't Cry"") and Charlotte (Kate Beckisndale of ""Brokedown Palace"") are two young publishing assistants who live as roommates in the city. Living on a love/hate relationship with one another, both girls decide to socialize with New York's club elite at the most popular club in the city.
There, they meet up with the likes of advertising execs and employees, odd club characters such as the Tiger Lady (played by Drew Barrymore's real-life mother, Jaid Barrymore) and others who give the film a unique flavor when it comes to recreating the disco era of the late 1970's/early 1980's.
While I really can't give away the details that moves the film to its' conclusion, all I can say that this film blows away the only other disco-era film that was released around the same time, ""Studio 54."" While the latter tried to recreate the final days of New York City's most infamous nightspot, it failed to capture the energy that disco era was well-known for. Unlike ""Studio 54,"" instead of revolving around the life of one character, ""Last Days"" focuses on the lives of several young professionals, which gives it more flavor and attraction.
Personally, Whit Stillman simply is one of the best American directors out there. His films all involve wit, energy, love, and the elements that plague young adults now and then. In one I consider to be one of the best-written scripts in recent years, Stillman pours plenty of wit and insight on what it is to be young and successful in a large city.
Another great thing about this film is its' excellent disco-era soundtrack. Covering such classics such as ""I'm Coming Out"" by Diana Ross and ""Everybody Dance"" by Chic, I almost felt that I was transported to the club in the film. If you loved this film, I highly recommend picking up a copy of the soundtrack.

The formula for these movies has been to track the lives of thoughful indiviudals in very specific histortical/sociological context; discos final days, the fleeting days of high society in NY, Barcelona in the midst of violent cultural change. This movie is not for fans of Staurday Night Fever or Studio 54. It is constructed in a dramatic tradition and offers windows into the charactors lives and  how they function within a context. This movie may be the less engaging of the three but it is, most likely, the most approachable of the three. All three of these ""period pieces"" are worth owning on DVD but the odds are that most poeple will find this to be the most outwardly engaging of the three. The dialog is less loaded than Stillmans other two movies (mostly because the Charactors are less intertwined than those in the other two films.)

981018,2,6305128960,"call me stupid, but i'm really confused. i'm trying to figure out how this movie passes for ""smartly written dialogue"" or  ""character-driven"".  actually, the latter is true; the great  tragedy of this movie is that it tries to balance itself on these throwaway  depictions of competitive meaninglessness.  the character of charlotte  (kate beckinsale in a wasted if solid performance) was particularly  one-dimensional.  i really wanted to lift her shirt to see if there was a  bitchy-comment string to pull.
p.s. characters, even those that you're  *supposed* to loathe, should be multifaceted.  it's no great feat of  screenwriting to create ""the boring yuppie""; anyone over 25 with  a working pen can do that.
and another thing: unique is NOT a synonym for  good. while it is refreshing to step away from the kneejerk predictability  of traditional hollywood fare, not all forays into novelty are fruitful.  this movie is particularly guilty of trying to stand on idiosyncrasy over  substance.
a quick turn to the acting: i thought it was impeccable, and  it's the only reason i gave this film any stars.  each actor plays their  role to the hilt. i thought it was great that these actors, who are  normally given so much more to work with, were able to play relentlessly  lame characters so convincingly.  i never thought i'd be bored watching  chloe sevigny, but she did it, and i think that's a testament to her  abilities.
in short, though this film makes some short stabs at humor  and irony, it's a bit too navel-gazing for my tastes. i prefer movies  slightly less self-conscious, accurately and multi-dimensionally drawn, and  to the point. hey, that makes me predictable! ironic twist at end of  review!",963619200,,1715,4.9822695035460995

The story line has so many twists and turns that you could watch it many times and still not see it all.  I am also a huge Chloe  Sevigny fan and she deserved an Oscar.  She was perfectly cast as Alice,  the woman who changed her image from kindergarten teacher to wild child.  If you watch this movie and enjoy it, I would throughly recommend  Metropolitan and Barcelona, Whit Stillman's early films.  The Last Days of  Disco is actually the middle movie in his ""trilogy""(Metropolitan,  Last Days, Barcelona).  Metropolitan is his best work, but the Last Days is  a wonderful and energetic film that no one (especially those of the disco  era) should miss!",961977600,,750,4.6692307692307695
981020,5,6305128960,"I don't know what I expected when I first saw The Last Days of Disco - even though I knew it was a Whit Stillman film, I still couldn't quite picture his take on the disco scene in NYC.  What I found was a delightful,  witty, perfectly cast, well acted movie populated by familiar - yet not  dull or overused - 'types' and peppered with smart, hilarious and revealing  dialogue.
I don't want to give too much of the plot away - as it's too  much fun to watch it unfold for yourself - although I will say that the  perspective on life for two recent college grads as they enter the  publishing world in NYC is quite realistic and amusing in many ways - the  female 'friend' who shows her 'friendship' with back-handed  compliments/insults, the cheap railroad apartment, and so on.
For me, the  real revelation was Sevigny.  I'd seen her before, but her role in this  movie is marvelous.  You actually SEE her transformation from an insecure  'sidekick' to her not-so-friendly 'friend' to a confident, secure and  independent woman throughout the course of the film - it's a subtle yet  vivid change, and by the end she even looks different.
I highly recommend  this movie, both because of it's witty dialogue, interesting characters and  fun peek back into the '80s, but also for the performances by Sevigny and  Beckinsale, who are terrific in their respective roles.  I've already  recommended this movie to all of my friends, and they, too, have enjoyed  it, although many, at first, confused it with the one about Studio 54.  Please don't make that mistake!  This is a great movie, and you shouldn't  miss it!",961113600,2,1612,4.6512455516014235
981021,5,6305128960,"I didn't like The Last Days of Disco I loved it. The quik dialoge and intelligent conversations between the characters were great and remeniscent of Barcelona and Metropolitan. The dialoge ranges from serious such as a  conversation talking about pregnancy,to a funny and cute conversation  dealing with The Lady and the Tramp,the Disney film.
Everyone does a  fantastic job in acting but the people who stand out are Chloe Sevigny,  Kate Beckinsale and Chris Eigeman. To me Chloe Sevingy is us,observing the  situation and just watching like us,shes a tender loving person and by the  end of the film we love her. Kate Beckinsale is a sassy and bitchy early  eightys girl and has mood swings constantly. Chris Eigeman is great as the  guy who when he wants to end a realationship tells the girls ""I'm  Gay"",he has the best dialoge in the film.
Whit Stillman did a great  job on the film with good direction and great writing I can't wait for him  to come out with a new film. The cinematography is great capturing the early  eightys and the music is nice too.
If you loved this movie check out  Metropolitain and Barcelona.",956620800,8,1124,4.702564102564103
981022,4,6305128960,"""The Last Days of Disco"" recalls a specific time - the very early 1980's.  The video opens with a shot of two young women walking down the street.  The shot is framed in such a way that you only see the bottom  half of their legs.  It's a shot that immediately recalls the disco-era  classic, ""Saturday Night Fever"" with it's similar opening -  clearly Whit Stillman (who wrote and directed) knows what he's doing.
The  film is a sort of coming-of-age story of two book publishing assistants -  Alice (well played by Chloe Sevigny who can be seen in the current  ""Boys Don't Cry"") and Charlotte (Kate Beckinsale).  Looking to  expand their social circle, they frequent a hard-to-get-into nightclub (not  mentioned but obviously patterned after New York's famed Studio 54).  The  more experienced Charlotte (""Maybe in physical terms I'm cuter than  you - but you should be much more popular than I am"") gives Alice lots  of advice - like how she should always try and throw the word  ""sexy"" into her conversation or how Harvard guys can be amazing  creeps.  She talks of the ""tremendous importance of group social  life"" and claims to oppose ""all this ferocious pairing off"".  She's a bit of a phony, however, which we (like Alice) come to find out.  But Stillman rises above making crass judgements about her, he doesn't make  fun of her - he essentially likes her, as he does all the characters.  This  includes Des, whose act is to pretend he's recently discovered he's gay in  order to gain sympathy from women, before cruelly dumping them.
Deftly  observed, ""The Last Days of Disco"" is one of the best videos I  saw in 1998.  It's an extremely talky, almost plotless, CHARACTER-driven  story.  The talk, however, is often very witty.  Take, for example, the  debate that films like ""Lady and the Tramp"" program women to  adore jerks.  Or the idea that the environmental movement started in the  50's after we all saw ""Bambi"".  This is a terrific film that  shines a light on a confusing time - a time many were scarcely prepared  for.",956275200,16,2038,4.698005698005698
981159,3,6305128960,"As with Barcelona, the highlight for me is the dialogue, especially from the mouth of Chris Eigeman (""It's Like, You Know..."").  But the dialogue here isn't quite so engaging as it is in Barcelona.
The  characters, while generally unlikable (Eigeman's character dumps women by  pretending to have ""discovered"" that he's gay), are well-drawn.

Music that spreads a gap of about 10 years for a club  scene set in the early 80's. Dress that also is reminiscent of 1970's but  also of 1990's? (What's with the Tommy Hilfiger ""rapper""head  bandana on the ONE gay couple? )One profound statement exists in the film  however, how some will look back on a very influential era and only see  John Travolta with his finger in the air in a polyester suit, hedonistic  values and  widespread drug use.

981163,4,6305128960,"The Last Days of Disco is a fantastic movie, but only if you are prepared to really listen to the dialogue.
The thing that I like most about Whit Stillman's movies is his characters - dissatisfied and confused with their  lives as they may be. My favourite actor in all of Stillman's movies is  Chris Eigeman, who always plays a cynical character, who is offensive to  all, but who I still find likeable. In The Last Days of Disco, Eigeman is  Des, a cocaine snorting, womanising underboss in popular nightclub.
Look  out for the hilarious Lady and the Tramp scene in the movie, as well as the  scene where Des snorts some hot coffee because it may contain the same  effects as cocaine. This is a movie that gets heavy on dialogue, but is  worth it. Even though the characters are pompous, they are extremely well  developed and acted.
The Last Days of Disco is a fantastic movie, and for  me brought alive the disco era in a way that movies such as Studio 54 did  not come near. But only for people who like to really watch movies, not  just have them on in the background.",947808000,15,1074,4.395939086294416
981164,4,6305128960,"Given the history of Stillman's other movies, I knew I was in for a movie with pretentious dialog and watchable characters (especially Beckinsale).  When the Disco era is now typically remembered, it is defined by  promiscuity, tacky polyester clothes and the obnoxious overplayed music of  the Saturday Night Fever Soundtrack. Not how it was defined for me and none  of that here.  The soundtrack, clothes and angst of being young and newly  independent are very accurate.  And as in real life, promiscuity does have  its consequences.  If you want to hear some of the better disco music and  see an accurate depiction of an era that most remember fondly, you won't be  disappointed.

981165,4,6305128960,"If you can't stand to watch another exploding helicopter, ""Disco"" and the other two Whit Stillman movies are a good antidote.  The characters actually say interesting things.
You may want  to watch ""Metropolitan"" before watching ""The Last Days of  Disco"" to understand the world the characters come from.  You may be a  little misled by watching ""Metropolitan"" first, though.  It's a  simple, gentle story while ""Barcelona"" and ""Disco"" are  sexier and set in more exotic locales.
Some reviewers didn't like these  movies because the characters speak articulately in fully-formed,  grammatically-correct sentences.  I can see where they might mistake it for  bad writing or acting.  The bio commentary on the ""Disco"" DVD  talks about the film crew being impressed by the Sevigny and Beckinsale's  ability to recreate New England prep school speech - an indication that  preppies really talk that way.  I'm from California where we're all  inarticulate, so I wouldn't know.  Ultimately, I don't care - people don't  break out singing in real life, either, but you wouldn't want to do away  with musicals.

The film itself reminded me a bit of ""Metropolitan"" and the character  of Tom Townsend, only it was now Sevigny's character.  Stillman's films  have a melancholy feel to them at times, and justifiably so because life  can be that way.  His characters, at least one and it's usually the  protagonist, are prudes but in a likeable way.  I think that is the way to  sum up a Stillman film.  I don't know if I liked disco music as much prior  to becoming a Stillman afficionado or if it came about because of him.  In  his films I'll miss the tying elements (though not all these elements are  prevalent in all three): sharp, witty dialogue, disco music, literary  references, dressing sharp and the always present relationships-theme.",925862400,4,878,4.708609271523179

Released around the same time as the mind-numbing  ""Armagedon,"" I felt like I had sat down for two hours of  conversation with some good friends.
The thing I enjoyed most about this  movie is that we are shown both the highs and the lows of these character's  lives. And although there has been much criticism of their narcissism, I  find these people very real and very refreshing. I feel that Whit Stillman  captures a class of people, a time of life, a social milieu, and a part of  history with such dead on accuracy that I was just in awe as the movie  unfolded.
I saw the movie three times in the theater and was moved to  tears each time by the end scene on the train. To me it so perfectly  brought the movie to a close, and, sums up the experience of life with such  precision: the pain, the humiliation, the joy, the beauty, the excitement,  and the struggles we all experience on a daily basis, but in the end, being  alive really is something to dance about.",918604800,,1179,4.398148148148148

The music was a bit dated for 1980 cause I remembered hearing Mandolay by La Flavour,, Hit N Run Lover by Carol Jiani, Take Your Time...by the SOS Band more than all the Chic and Ritchie Family songs that were being played in the disco where the group of actors would hang out.
