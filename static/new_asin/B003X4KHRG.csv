4215810,4,B003X4KHRG,"I am reviewing this, like I did with Partial Terms of Endearment, from a free rental I received before street date through my employer. Perhaps the lone perk of working in a video store!

'It's a Trap' opens with your typical Star Wars style scroll in which Seth admits that he really didn't want to do this one, but with the success of the previous two Fox had demanded it. He does ask for viewers to suspend their expectations and promises a better product on their next venture, however I think this is largely tongue-in-cheek because this one was every bit as enjoyable as Blue Harvest, and in my opinion better than Something, Something.  A few gags do drag a bit too long, and seem like they are just filler, but the laughs more than make up for the lags.

Return of the Jedi is arguably the easiest of the Star Wars films to pick apart, and they do a great job with it. I didn't feel that the material was tired.  It actually had some great moments.  True fans of the show will enjoy it.",1291939200,68,994,4.32258064516129
4215811,3,B003X4KHRG,"The first 2 Star Wars parodies were great but this one was horrible.  I know Return of the Jedi was considered by some to be the worst Star Wars movie of the original trilogy, but Seth could have done a better overall job.  The jokes were mostly older ones from the series that have been done hundreds of times.  But then again the opening crawler warns us that this episode was done for money, and Seth really did not want to do it.  So I guess the ending joke is on us.  I will not ruin it for you, just be warned this is not as good as the first 2 Star Wars spoofs.

NOTE:  I just watched Robot Chicken episode 3 and I can say it was great.  150% better than this family guy episode.  It is almost like the original writers of Blue Harvest were hired to do the new Robot Chicken.  Now on to what I really wanted to say.  After being taunted for this review I decided to rewatch this DVD screener.  In the end I felt like changing my rating to 2 stars, but decided to let my original rating stand.  I still think this is the worst STAR WARS Family Guy Parody.  I did have a chuckle when I realized the Rancor was actually RUSH Limbaugh, but the humor soon faded.  The reason is because they use most of the same jokes they already did in the first two and then over used them throughout this parody.  Like for example there is section of this show were they are shaking their heads for several minutes while they are waiting to throw Luke in the Sarlac Pit.  AS soon as it ends, you think okay now it is time for the action, but just seconds later Han and Chewie make this same gesture again when they are attacked by Boba Chicken.  Even worse is they nod heir head until Boba simply vanishes.  When Han asks what happened to Boba, Chewie simply comments ""He fell into the pit.""  To some this may have been funny, but I think it was a missed opportunity.  Instead of making this boring they could have stole from Robot Chicken and had Boba fall into the pit in a funny way, then claim he jumped in (or did something completely different that was funnier than this lame excuse for a joke).

Another scene repeated from the first parody is the appearance of John Williams and his orchestra.  Only this time they are on bicycles (you will understand why when you see this scene).  Once more Luke asks them if they could play something different and they do.  There are several more examples I could throw out there but in the end this is only my opinion of this show.  Yours may differ.

And before I am asked again.  No I will not remove this review.",1291420800,26,2550,4.212809917355372
4215812,2,B003X4KHRG,"The first Star Wars ep was great...2nd was mediocre and this one is just awful...Seth Macfarlane continues his trend of doing a joke over and over and over again and fails to realize it wasn't funny in the first five seconds (there is one scene where they nod at each other endlessly).

The first 25 minutes were pretty much laugh free...there are maybe 4 good jokes...

I will say the computer animation and score (i.e. the original one) is fantastic. It's a real shame they couldn't hire a writer capable of producing anything remotely funny.",1290988800,29,544,4.71578947368421

Family guy can be crass, obnoxious, and basic in it's humor (which is why many like it), but this is also quite a loving homage to the Return of the Jedi. You won't see the film being trashed here, though you might see it being teased mercilessly. The writers obviously loved the film.
So if you hate Family Guy, this probably won't convert you. If you love the show, this is essential.

4215843,4,B003X4KHRG,"The FAMILY GUY parody of the original Star Wars trilogy concludes in IT'S A TRAP! Once again the power goes out and the Griffin family reluctantly tells the story of  RETURN OF THE JEDI, but with a FAMILY GUY twist. All three of the FAMILY GUY Star Wars parodies follow the basic overall plot of the original movies. However, IT'S A TRAP! sticks even closer to the source material. That's not to say that it's not funny, because it is. It's just that sometimes it takes a long time for the payoff to a joke and there just aren't as many as there were in the first two parodies. The biggest difference between IT'S A TRAP and the previous parodies is that several of the newer characters are played by characters from other MacFarlane shows, such as THE CLEVELAND SHOW and AMERICAN DAD. Overall, IT'S A TRAP is a great wrap-up to the FAMILY GUY Star Wars trilogy re-tellings.

Note: it's amazing how many people have rated IT'S A TRAP! negatively simply because of the opening crawl. MacFarlane put just as much effort into IT'S A TRAP as he did the other two re-tellings. The opening crawl is a joke. I'm not really a fan of FAMILY GUY, but even I got the whole ""the entire opening crawl is one big joke.""",1396656000,,1205,4.423423423423423

Some might call this the biggest disappointment not only among the Family Guy Star Wars spoofs, but in the entire Family Guy series. Those people are wrong, but there are certainly more Family Guy episodes that are better than this one than those that are worse.

Without a doubt, this is the weakest entry in the Star Wars spoof series. It spends almost as much time making fun of itself as it does the source material (Return of the Jedi). Instead of reusing Family Guy characters to fill different roles like they did from BH going into SSSDS, characters were brought in from McFarlane's other shows American Dad and The Cleveland Show to share the screen. While some parts of the parody are more or less direct transitions from Jedi, such as the roughly 90 second set up to ""I don't know, fly casual,"" the punchline is worth the wait more often than not. While It's a Trap! has a slower paced humor (largely due to the lengthy setups mentioned before), it still manages to retain the Family Guy air with a few nonchalant fart, sex, religion, gay and black jokes to go around and a few moments of hyper violence to ease the tension.

To sum up, yes, this is bad. But it's not nearly as bad as Seth McFarlane makes it out to be in the opening title scrawl. In my opinion, Seth is his own worst critic and It's a Trap! is still worth watching.",1357171200,,2108,5.77491961414791

That's a bit like what ""Its a Trap"" was.  The roll at the beginning has creator Seth MacFarlane complaining that he didn't really want to do this movie.  Its funny until you realize its true.  Jokes that don't connect and unfunny characters from MacFarlane's various spin offs don't work at all.  The German gold fish as Admiral Ackbar and Cleavland's son as ... I dunno ... that weird mumbling dude in the Falcon ... should have been two of the best characters and neither one worked at all.

Its clearly something they didn't really care about and doesn't have near the love and attention of the first two.

 The jokes (?) came across as, at best, lame. More often they fell flat. The writing, such as it was, seemed limp and forced.

Special Features:  A Very Special Message from Darth Stewie (I found hilarious), Star Wars Trivial Pursuit championship (between the writers of the 3 Family Guy Star Wars Episodes).(Not too bad), Drawings/Animatics, Sock-puppet outtakes (spoof, about 1 minute), Making the Scene (animatic/finished comparison), Commentary (There is also a commentary in the Set-up menu, possibly the same one, but I didn't check).

If you are here, you've probably seen the other two FG SW spoofs already. This one continues (and finishes most likely) the trilogy in the same manner as the first two. Possibly the best of the three, if you've seen the first two don't skip on this one. If you haven't seen the first two, do so then don't skip this one...",1299888000,,915,5.148648648648648
4215879,5,B003X4KHRG,"LOVE IT..!!  Gags are much fresher than 'Something.. Darkside' and pacing is excellent. ""Return of the Jedi"" was my least favorite of the originals, but this spoof makes up for nearly everything and personally I found it MUCH MORE enjoyable and fulfilling than watching the original Lucas film.

Where 'Something.. Darkside' spewed out too many 'F-bombs' and gay jokes for my taste, the humor in 'Its a Trap!' was smart and dead-on, and certainly sits next to 'Blue Harvest' as the best ones.

I can watch Blue Harvest over and over and not get tired of the jokes. Maybe I am getting older but I just don't enjoy FG like I used to. The humor on the show is way too political and mean spirited. It is almost as if they are switching to a Matt & Trey style of comedy (say the edgiest thing possible just cause you can, not because it is necessarily funny or adds anything). I re-watch seasons 1-4 and really enjoy it but the most recent seasons are pretty bad. It is seems like the best writers are now on American Dad and Cleveland Show.",1298937600,,657,4.140625

For one thing, they ran out of Family Guy characters and for another thing, the funniest joke in the entire movie is not related to Star Wars at all. Also, why did they never air this on TV?

It is stupid silly fun and takes as much time to trash Family Guy as to make fun of Return of the Jedi.  It's silly and stupid and if you take the time to enjoy it in this light I am sure you will enjoy it more.  I am sure some will hate the use of characters from The Cleveland Show and American Dad but hey just sit back and laugh.,1297468800,,421,3.707865168539326

4215891,5,B003X4KHRG,"I do not know what is wrong with everyone giving this movie low reviews. Really? Me and my kids have watched this movie 4 times within the past month. It is just as funny as the other 2 if not funnier. I cannot believe all the gags they put in it.

It was so funny when Jabba(Played by Joe) started laughing and Peter said, ""Wow, it's the 7 UP guy"".  Or you might like the part where someone asked Darth Vader if he can feel Lukes presence after Darth asked about the ship he was flying in. Darth said, ""No, he's right there"". All of a sudden Lukes head went down to hide. Perhaps the funniest moment was when the whole crew was about to be killed and they kept nodding their heads at eachother. Believe me that part is just too funny.

I can go on and on. We have all the Family Guy DVD's and this one is a treasure. I would be way more critical of the Cleveland show or perhaps last year's Family Guy season than I would be of this new installment of the Star Wars Trilogy.

Believe me, if you get this movie, you will NOT be dissapointed!",1296086400,,1041,4.088235294117647
4215892,3,B003X4KHRG,"It's ok. The opening crawl says it all; "" bear with us... We're exhausted... Fox threatened us..."" it had it's moments, like the deliberate violence, but overall it's just meh.",1295913600,,176,4.9
4215893,5,B003X4KHRG,"I watched it twice this weekend and a third time with the commentary track.

I found it to be just as enjoyable as the previous two parodies.  ""Jedi"" is widely regarded as the least satisfying installment of the Star Wars original trilogy.  Part of that may stem from the general disdain towards the ""cuteness quotient"" of the Ewoks, and part of that might simply be because ""The Empires Strikes Back"" was a hard act to follow.  Truth be told, anyone trying to parody ""Return of the Jedi"" simply has less fruitful material to work with.

The ""Family Guy"" staff readily admits they had trouble writing this episode.  It's hard to parody the same thing three times and keep it fresh.  But I think they did a more than adequate job with it.  And visually it is even more spectacular than the previous two.

It may not be as consistently funny as ""Blue Harvest"" or ""Something, Something, Something Dark Side"", but you must admit that the novelty of a Family Guy parody of a Star Wars film has worn off a bit by now.  Given that, I think writers David Goodman and Cherry Chevapravatdumrong did a fine job.  I am happy to add this DVD to my library alongside the other two parodies.

Speaking of staff writer Cherry Chevapravatdumrong, she is one of the four writers of these parodies featured in the DVD bonus content feature in which they compete in a game of Star Wars Trivial Pursuit.  Cherry is very easy on the eyes, if you know what I mean, and it wouldn't surprise me if she started getting a little bit of fan mail.  Not only is she a Star Wars fan, she also went to Yale and later earned a law degree.  She's good-looking, funny, smart, AND a little nerdy.  I'm in love from afar!

That aside, ""It's A Trap!"" is better than the negative reviews here would indicate.  It manages to skewer the film and maintain its ""Family Guy"" sensibility.

This one is similar enough in tone and execution to the previous two parodies that I believe anyone who loved the first two but gave this one a deeply negative review is just over-reacting. For something to be truly deserving of a one- or two-star review, it really needs to be crummy on just about every level.  That would not be the case here.  I think the large number of low-star reviews here are from people who just were disappointed that it didn't meet their high expectations for whatever reasons, and they angrily dismissed the film as being worse than it truly is.  But hey, that's the Internet for you.

I think my favorite joke in the whole episode was the ""Power Station"" gag.  If you weren't listening to rock radio in the mid 1980's, you might not get the joke.  But this show is for us over-40 adults too, not just you young whippersnappers.",1295827200,,2702,4.487704918032787
4215894,4,B003X4KHRG,"This is an awesome DVD. If you like Family Guy and Star Wars (kind of goes hand-in-hand), there are a lot of subtle allusions mixed in with the typical Family Guy sarcasm. Funniest Star Wars spin off Family Guy has done so far!",1295654400,,227,4.3023255813953485

I thought, "" Something, Something, Something Dark Side was brillant, almost a perfect parody. The first was a goos effort and had its moments. But this one; ""It's a Trap! "", is only for the hardcore. And even saying that is not saying much. There are maybe 2 great jokes in here. But otherwise, if your only a fan who watches occassionaly, then Rent it! But buying it; skip it!
Even at the begining of the movie, the characters of Family Guy, Peter, Lois, Meg, Stewie & Brain all come right out and make a statment about, ""Were doing Jedi, aren't we?"" And maybe I missed the joke. But they really sounded as if they really didn't want to do this movie. And in now infamous plot line that goes up explaining the story line of Star Wars, is says that ""Fox"" made them do this movie.
It felt so tired, and all so lackluster and unintresting. It was just only above average rating. I even think I am being kind to this movie, because I am such a huge fan, but this movie should be a 2 out of 5. Overall, as I said if your a hardcore fan and collect all their seasons and other videos, it does complete the collection and has a few good moments.

Either way, this had a potential for being hilarious: the other two shows were quite good, ""Blue Harvest"" especially. Not this one. The opening title sequence even tells us that ""assistants"" did all of the writing, and it shows. I could even tell when the writing staff just said, ""Hey, let's do another one of those extra-long 'jokes' like we do in 'Family Guy', where it stops being funny after 45 or 50 seconds of doing the same thing.""

The comments at the start saying that they were forced into making it etc. I don't know, was it a joke? Maybe...maybe not.

I actually paused in the middle to call my bank and didn't regret it. I know I laughed a couple of times, but a couple of hours later, I couldn't remember what they were about.

Some points:

- Ha ha making fun of Seth Green. Yeah, we get that he works for both Robot Chicken AND Family Guy. Get over it.

- What about Boba Fett? He's there, you drag out everything else, and then he's gone. I was expecting some epic Peter as Han vs Chicken as Fett scene. Instead... nothing.

- Special Features: more boring. I did enjoy the Trivial Pursuit feature because it reminded me of parties with my other nerdy friends. However, could you have found a woman who's seen the movies more than once? Thanks for perpetuating the idea that woman don't like Star Wars or if they do it's only casual and they're stupid.

Yes, there are many scenes that are not funny (too many fecal and below-the-belt references in some places or the killing scenes). But there are other scenes that are just hilarious (e.g. the bike chase, brilliant or the ""backside of the force"" or ""this time there is no trench"" or the discussion about Seth Green at the end). Seth McFarlane should have reused the elefant instead of whining about not wanting to do the movie. It clearly is not a masterpiece but still worth watching (being a little infantile helps). And in the end you can't argue about humor - some like it, some don't. Fans of Family Guy will buy it anyway and Family Guy haters will, well, hate it (which raises the question why they buy the DVD in the first place).",1294358400,,910,4.4226190476190474
4215907,1,B003X4KHRG,"Anything that starts with an apology really should get you worried.
Like text messages a sprawling movie message is observed without context,
So whether it was sarcastic or implied it reads like an actual apology.
Which then puts the viewer into a worried non-funny state of mind, which the rest of the production keeps you in for an hour.

Pros:
 - Star Wars characters and settings.
 - About two funny jokes.

Cons:
 - CONWAY TWITTY, including this characters was slightly funny the first episode they did it in. It stopped being funny when they put in 2 FULL MINUTES of him into a later episode. Now its just padding, obviously unfunny padding.
 - American Dad and Cleveland characters.
  Nothing wrong with these characters being in the show, but they don't do anything funny, so they only give you a giggle if you're familiar with them. And its alot to expect Star Wars fans to have seen the Cleveland show.
 - Another 2 minutes where nothing happens.
  Dragging that instant where Luke was about to jump into the sarlacc was awful. The first few seconds were original, the next two minutes weren't. And throwing it in later for another ten seconds wasn't.
 - Boba Fett is dealt with off-screen.
  Hey why not have one of the favorite characters just vanish and have someone say what happened to him. Because its not funny
 - Follows each scene without much imagination at all.
 - Tired puns instead of jokes.
 - Too much time between jokes and too short anyway.

Conclusion:
 Don't bother, just don't, the first two were had originality and humour.
 This one just makes you wish you could have that almost hour of your life back.
 With all that potential and so much to make fun of.... all you get is a complete mess with some free advertising for American Dad and Cleveland Show characters.",1294358400,25,1797,4.659235668789809

It was funny and irreverent, and had a great appeal to those of us who were around when the Star Wars movies first came out as well as the young fans (like my grand nephew) who just discovered the series. The second installment,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Family-Guy-Presents-Something-Something-Something-Dark-Side/dp/B002LARYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Family Guy Presents: Something Something Something Dark Side</a>, had some of that same love and pride.
What we're told from the moment ""It's a Trap"" begins is that the honeymoon has worn off and the characters are tired of having to do yet another parody of Star Wars. Their intention was to just get it over with, and we're left thinking that it's just a fun setup for a great way to end the series. The famous Star Wars scrawl begins, and now it's the writer's turn to tell us how done they are with the series, and how this was an obligation to finish up. I was still really optimistic, and loved the way the whole thing looked. The animation, now done for a 16:9 widescreen format, looks better than ever and the blu-ray version has colors that really pop and, really, the whole thing looks gorgeous. I tried my best to go for the ride and enjoy it, and there were a few jokes that I loved. I did find myself wondering, however, why it felt a little flat. I got through it, and thought I would find some fun in the commentary or special features.
The commentary begins with a general feeling that they hated the process this time around. Seth MacFarlane didn't even last throughout the whole commentary and left the room part of the way through. There were awkward silences. At one point, Cherry Chevapravatdumrong expressed hope that George Lucas would be listening to the commentary and allow the group another visit to Lucasfilm, and my immediate thought was that George would have lost interest in the commentary once he picked up on the uninspired mood of the bunch.
That's what this last installment is leaning towards, sadly. The artists and performers had a field day, but the writing and producers seemed anxious to finish off the series and move on, vowing to never take on a trilogy again. All this, coming from a TV series that was cancelled twice and brought back by the fans.

Haha funny joke!  At least that is what I thought until the film was over, then I saw Seth really was being dead serious.  I was very disappointed that this was the way the trilogy was going to end, and even more sick to hear Peter suggest at the end that the Cleveland show would be doing episodes 1-3.

Family Guy has been on a slow decline for a while now.  It seems the writers are spending no time, that they realize that they could smear s*** on cardboard and people would eat it up.  Most episodes are so loaded down with a liberal agenda that noone can stomach them.  Family Guy was supposed to be a fun, shock facter based adult cartoon, not a political statement. Let me make it clear that yes I am a conservative, however I don't mind political jokes aimed at ANY party and that is why I like American Dad it handles issues from both sides in a funny way.  Family Guy is just cramming politics down throats, either laugh at both points of view or not at all, but don't try to make every line Brian says propaganda.

While I can say that ""Its a Trap!"" had its parts, it was nothing like I expected.  Never was there just a joke that made me fall out laughing.  Just as the Han panting scene in ""Darkside"" was taken overboard, there is a nodding scene in ""Trap"" that seems like it will NEVER end.  There is so much area to cover in Return of the Jedi, why waste time on a space filler?  Couldn't come up with anything better?  The characters were casted well (I liked seeing Roger from American Dad and the bear from Cleveland show), but there just wasn't a good script for them.  The jokes were sparse, and it really made it seem like they were just rushing to get this polished turd out and smile at the mass amount of preorder and midnight release sales they knew they would get. Really immature humor and no wit like I was hoping for.

Bottom line is if you are a HUGE Family Guy/Star Wars fan, I would buy this just to add to the collection.  If having the series complete isn't important to you, rent it, watch it with a friend, or wait until it comes on tv.  Save you're money.",1293926400,4,2329,4.240362811791384

Well, ""Family Guy"" has come this far so it just makes sense to continue the rest of the way into the Return of the Jedi remake. This movie being released on Blu-ray and DVD is definitely Fox seeing the dollar signs and their jokes starting to get a little lazy and reaching as they admit in their opening credits.

The big difference between Robot Chicken's Star Wars parodies and Family Guy's is the jokes. Robot Chicken comes up with bits specifically worked around jokes and situations that they find hilarious and piece them together at random to make you bust a gut. Family Guy chose to go complete parody using their own characters almost line for line by the original script and then trying to make it funny. Family Guy IS funny, it's just that the format locks them into a sequence of events that follow the movie and they have to work within those confines. For example, the hover bike chase scene through the forest becomes an actual bicycle chase with explosions. They've run out of Family Guy characters to use so they've started borrowing from ""American Dad"" and ""The Cleveland Show"". The German fish character actually gets the ""It's a trap!"" line.

Some of the jokes they really nail, especially in the last fifteen minutes or so. They pull in some classic Family Guy pranks of letting a joke go on WAY too long (nodding to each other in sequence) and throwing in a ""Darth Twitty"" clip (Conway Twitty with a photoshopped Darth Vader helmet on his head). Tim the Bear from ""The Cleveland Show"" is the Ewok with speaking lines and Rallo is partnered with Mort playing Lando for the Millenium Falcon battle scenes. The Ewok battles are far more bloody than you might remember in ""Return of the Jedi"" as some anti-Ewok creators were clearly getting their revenge. It's funny and if you saw the other two you should watch this.

Bonus Features:

Obviously, there is a digital copy. There is some sort of short episode advertisement for ""Bob's Burgers"" that starts up before getting to the menu that I had to skip past because I wanted to watch the show with family. When I watched it later, it wasn't very good.

The Star Wars Trivial Pursuit championship is a very dramatic extra involving producers and writers who worked on the story for Family Guy: It's a Trap getting together at a warehouse to play Star Wars Trivial Pursuit so one could become ultimate champion of Star Wars Knowledge. No, Seth MacFarlane is not there but familiar voices you have heard on commentary are. There is David Goodman (who sounds like the guy from ""Everybody Loves Raymond""), Cherry with the longest last name ever that looks fake but isn't, Alec Sulkin, and Kirker. I'm pretty sure I've played this exact game before and some of it is HARD! It's a fun way to test your own skills if you can get the answer before they do.

Drawing with Peter Shin is a cute little ""how to draw the characters"" bit. If sketching and cartooning is your deal, this is for you. It's amazing how much personality can be captured quickly in sharpie! The Sock Puppet outtakes are short-lived, the Animatic and Making the Scene both show how the original animation transfers to the final version.

A very special message from Darth Stewie is a voicemail from Darth to his son, Luke about his technology difficulties making a photo slideshow. The feature-length audio commentary features Seth MacFarlane, David A. Goodman, Cherry Chevapravatdumrong (see what I mean??), Shannon Smith, and Peter Shin. Seth leaves about halfway through because he is very busy and important but while the show originated from him, it clearly has a life of its own now listening to the others talking about it. These other guys are mostly the ones behind the creative, the writing, and the directing. They verify that everything written in the opening credits is true and greet the listening audience with affectionate expletives.",1293840000,,3936,4.752562225475842
4215917,4,B003X4KHRG,"Seth MacFarlane's take on the original Star Wars trilogy a la Family Guy is complete, and while It's a Trap isn't as overly funny or quite as fun as Blue Harvest or Something, Something, Something, Darkside; it still manages to deliver the goods and end things on a high enough note.  The events of Return of the Jedi are played out funny enough, with enough Family Guy characters (as well as charcters from American Dad and The Cleveland Show) popping up to help keep your attention.  Between that and the hysterical ribbing on Seth Green, It's a Trap is a worthwhile and funny conclusion to the trilogy.  The opening scroll foretelling the suckage of It's a Trap is only half-true: it doesn't have that same feel to it that made Blue Harvest so great, but it's funny enough in its own right to warrant your attention.",1293753600,2,819,4.595890410958904
4215918,4,B003X4KHRG,"Not as good as the others, but part of that is they aren't parodying as good a Star Wars movie.  Still, pretty funny and I'd recommend it to those that liked the first two.",1293667200,,172,4.0588235294117645
4215919,2,B003X4KHRG,"The fact that in the first 3 minutes, the creator himself tells the audience that his creation was clearly rushed and says ""Lower your expectations, okay?"" was a truly disappointing sight. The movie itself had plenty of gaps, and was obviously not done well at all.

I give the writers credit for their effort, but besides that, it was just... awful.

Seth Macfarlane, you have saddened your fans. In my eyes, you have just made ""It's a Trap"" for your own profit, as you stated: ""Fox wouldn't let me direct my movie if I didn't do Jedi"". Great job Seth, great job.",1293667200,8,564,4.519607843137255
4215920,1,B003X4KHRG,"The crawl at the beginning has MacFarlane explaining that he didn't care about this and he let the assistants write it.  Then the characters joke about how bad it is during the film.  I loved the first two, but I didn't laugh more than about 3 times during this thing.  Family Guy is great because it combines intelligent and low brow humor, which was severely lacking in this installment.  Besides, Fox just likes to sell this on DVD first so they can make some cash, so just wait until Dec. 2011 and watch it for free on TV.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!",1293667200,23,546,4.366336633663367
4215921,1,B003X4KHRG,"Horrible, the scrawl in the beginning says it all:

""Luke Skywalker has returned to his home planet of Tatooine in order to-- okay, you know what, we don't care.  We were thinking of not even doing this one.  Fox made us do it. When we did 'Blue Harvest', they said, 'Oh, you guys are crazy.'  They tried to talk us out of it, and it ended up making a ton of money.  By then we were just finishing 'Empire', and we were absolutely exhausted.  But Fox suddenly had dollar signs in their eyes and they said, 'Seth, if you don't do 'Jedi', we're not gonna let you leave to go direct your movie.'

I'm sorry.  I took a muscle relaxer earlier and it's kicking in.  I'm just so stressed because there's been a car parked in front of my house for three straight days and there's a pillow in the back seat.  And I've never seen anyone get in or out of it, but it moves a couple of feet one way or the other each day.  Wouldn't it be funny if it was a bunch of raccoons living in there moving it?  You know, with their little paws on the steering wheel?  And then another one working the brake and the gas?  And the steering wheel raccoon and the pedal raccoon have to talk back and forth to each other 'cause the brake pedal guy can't see the road?  I'm gonna keep thinking that, 'cause I know really it's probably a car bum.

Look, just do me a huge favor and lower your expectations, okay?  Just this one time.  I promise I'll make it up to you.  I mean. 'Star Wars', fine.  'Empire'-- stil not bad.  But on this one we ran out of gas.  Seriously, we let the assistants write it.  Hell, even the Fed Ex guy got a joke in, and he calls the baby 'Steve.'  Any way, here's 'Return of the Jedi' starring Steve as Darth Vader.""",1293667200,11,1716,4.114803625377643
4215922,3,B003X4KHRG,"""It's a Trap"" is the third and final entry of the Family Guy Star Wars parodies. And it matches ""Return of the Jedi"" in two respects, it's both the most spectacular in terms of visual effects and the least of the three films in it's storyline or ""comedic"" effort.

If you've seen ""Return of the Jedi"", you know the plot so I won't delve too deeply into that. The opening paragraph warns us not to expect a whole lot and unfortunately the effort lives up to that promise. Pretty much, Han Solo (Peter) is still trapped in carbonite and released by Princess Leah (Lois). A few gags are priceless such as the overlong ""nod"" scene before Luke Skywalker (Chris) is to be thrown into the monster (Meg), the brief appearence of ""Darth Twitty"", and any scene with Family Guy's best creation, Darth Vader (Stewie).

Plenty of curses are thrown about to punch up the ""comedy"", coming mostly from the Emporer (Carter Pewterschmit). And the most interesting guest ""voice"" comes from Carrie Fisher who plays the only woman other than Leah in the entire Star Wars universe it seems.

Probably the best aspect of this feature is it's spectacular look. The planets, ships, and even the characters have never looked better. The detail and color of the ""Emporer's Chamber"" aboard the Death Star is the most impressive, at times looking almost ""real"".

Extras include a short, somewhat funny bit by ""Darth Stewie"". A brief outtake section featuring a sock puppet (one of the funnier bits in ""It's a Trap""), a so-so ""making of..."" scene which mirrors the audio commentary from what sounds like a bunch of worn-out members of the ""Family Guy"" staff. Heck, Seth McFarland walks out halfway through for no particular reason it seems. The only bright spot is a Star Wars Trivial Pursuit match between four members of the Family Guy staff. It's not so much the thirty minutes of watching folks playing Trivial Pursuit, but just the audacity of putting such a feature in a DVD makes it the most bold inclusion in an otherwise mundane set of extras.

What began as an inspired take on ""Star Wars"" has worn its way down to this tired effort. It shows how much of a toll producing three series (""Family Guy"", ""The Cleveland Show"" and ""American Dad"") have been on this crew. And while one of the producers in the commentary joked about doing ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"", it might be better if they dumped a series or two first (starting with ""Cleveland""...please) before trying something else.",1293580800,,2469,4.719257540603248
4215923,5,B003X4KHRG,"I don't agree with the people who wrote bad about It's a Trap!. Sure, Blue Harvest and Something, Something, Something Dark Side were funnier than this, but it was still good, none the less. I can't wait to get this on DVD!!!",1293580800,2,225,4.380952380952381
4215924,3,B003X4KHRG,"There's no denying that FAMILY GUY is no more the sarcastic, in-your-face irreverent sitcom that it once was.  Now, it's almost a parody of its former self; the intro text to this film is so full of self-referencing egotism that one wishes Fox would fire Seth MacFarlane for a day, just so he has a sense of how unfunny he is now.  And there are so many jokes in here that fall flat that it makes you yearn for SOMETHING, SOMETHING, SOMETHING DARK SIDE (which is only better than IT'S A TRAP because its source film was better).

All of that being said...you'll note the 3 Stars.  That's because, when IT'S A TRAP hits its stride (inconsistent though it may be), it's hilarious.  STAR WARS fans won't get as much a kick out of it as the first two in the mock-trilogy (there are far fewer insider jokes), but FAMILY GUY aficionados (even if, like me, you now longer keep up with the show itself) will enjoy seeing their favorite (and least favorite; the video store clerk as Yoda has to be at the bottom of a long list of bad decisions) characters from the series portraying the legendary George Lucas creations.  It's still a delight to see Stewie as Darth Vader; he still remains the show's funniest character, alongside Peter (both of whom are superbly voiced by MacFarlane; say what you want to about his waning sense of humor, but the man knows how to voice characters).  And the musical takes on the STAR WARS theme (there's a great disco sequence) remain inspired.

So basically, IT'S A TRAP is for die-hard FAMILY GUY fans only.  All others, stick with the show (or, rather, the first four seasons; maybe even the fifth, if you're drunk enough).  And if you aren't a fan of the show, then there's no reason for even reading this review or checking out the movie.  It's great moments are good, but its worst moments are almost deplorable.  Here's hoping that MacFarlane will hit his stride with his next show (which is decidedly not THE CLEVELAND SHOW, and AMERICAN DAD has lost all of its promising potential).",1293580800,,2017,4.572222222222222
4215925,4,B003X4KHRG,"Sadly ""It's a TRAP"" is the final Family Guy take on the original Star Wars Trilogy, concluding the Laugh it Up, Fuzzball Trilogy. According to creator Seth MacFarlane  ""It's a TRAP"" is to be the last of the Star Wars parodies as the Family Guy team feels the SW prequels are already animated enough (although Peter Griffin expects that the Cleveland Show will do them).  Return of the Jedi in their opinion, and most Star Wars fans, is the worst of the original Trilogy, so it stands to reason that the Family Guy parody of episode VI. should be the lesser of the animated spoofs.  I find that this isn't the case, although there is a disclaimer in the opening crawl to this effect, in actuality this outing is just a funny and irreverent as the rest of the Specials or the TV series for that matter, well maybe slightly less (see Penultimate paragraph below).  The story continues with the familiar characters from Quahog, Rhode Island retelling the story of Star Wars while portraying natural role assignments: Stewie as Vader, Peter as Han, Chris is Luke, Lois as Leia, Brian plays Chewy, Cleveland and Quagmire play R2 & CPO.  ""Darkside"" role pick-ups return with Carter Pewterschimidt ( as the Emperor and Carl the convenience store clerk is Yoda, Ernie the Giant Chicken returns as Boba Fett and Mort Goldman as Lando.  Great character cameos include characters from the Cleveland Show and American Dad like Klaus as Admiral Ackbar, Roger as imperial Moff Jerjerrod,  Tim as an Ewok and Rallo Tubbs, too. The guest star cameo list again include Rush Limbaugh, Patrick Stuart, Michael Dorn, Carrie Fisher, Anne Hathaway, Mary Hart and of course Mr. Conway Twitty.  The story naturally follows Return of the Jedi's premise,  Han's rescue from Jabba the Hutt and the mission against the new Deathstar begins, while Luke must confront Vader and the Emperor. Then the hilarity ensues as in the previous parodies. Especially notable scenes are the ""special edition"" CGI sockpuppet appearances and the Seth Green trashing finale.

Of course, like ""Blue Harvest"" and ""Something, something Dark Side"" the Family Guy versions depend partly on at least passing pop culture, some Star Wars awareness and partly on an intricate knowledge of Star Wars. This isn't a complaint really, just a curious observation. For example is you haven't seen Return of the Jedi  in it's original non-special edition theater  or VHS format you may not get the Ewok song gags.  Great stuff no matter what, the only thing missing is the staple musical number, like Hebert's Ben Kenobi Dirty Dancing in "" Blue Harvest""  and Chris' Luke-Duet in ""Darkside."" This may be just as well as the later number, seemed forced, no pun intended.

I hope this isn't the last of their straight to DVD parodies, as the series references Star Wars more than any other movies, it was a natural. But, trying to think of a series reference that runs close second, it could be the ""Back to the Future Trilogy"" ""Indiana Jones"" or ""Magnum P.I.""  Well I can dream can't I?",1293580800,,3022,4.827519379844961
4215926,2,B003X4KHRG,It's ok. Worth it if you got the Blu-ray pack for 22.99$. It's a Trap! was the worst one of the bunch. Almost seemed as if they really didn't want to do that one.

4215929,2,B003X4KHRG,"In the opening scrolling text sequence in the beginning of ""It's a Trap!"" the writers tell a tale about how they literally put no effort into the writing of this because they were so exhausted after having done ""Something, Something, Something, Darkside"" that they just didn't care... this is not a joke.  It is the absolute truth and it's even admitted to by Seth McFarlane in the commentary, and it's apparent from the first joke.

""It's a Trap!"" is boring and unfunny for the most part and generally predictable and nowhere near as good as ""Blue Harvest"" or ""Something, Something, Something Darkside"" (with ""Blue Harvest"" being the best).  There is one truly hilarious scene in the film but that's it.  The rest is pretty much a waste of time from a comedy standpoint and what's going to be disappointing is that this is that is going to be this season's season finale because that's what they've been doing with these direct-to-video movies for the last four years.  It's really a shame because, ""It's a Trap!"" is going to tarnish what has been the best season of ""Family Guy"" since the relaunch.  This episode seem more suited to second or third season post-relaunch with the unfunny jokes and jokes that just got dragged on forever.  If you need any further proof of how bad this is or how the writers mailed it in, they threw in a Conway Twitty scene... again.

The only reason it's getting two stars instead of one is because the special features are pretty decent (the commentary is funnier than the film) and the animation is fantastic.  This is the first of the ""Family Guy"" Star Wars spoofs to be produced in 16:9 and it is visually stunning.

Unless you are a die-hard ""Family Guy"" fan and you must have this, I wouldn't recommend it.  the only reason I purchased the trilogy is because I needed the ""Blue Harvest"" Blu-Ray and the trilogy was just $4.00 more than just the one film.",1293494400,2,1895,4.626865671641791
4215930,2,B003X4KHRG,"I think Seth MacFarlane was trying to warn viewers away from this episode, between the title and the opening scrolling words, where he specifically tells you that he didn't want to do the Jedi parody, phoned it in, and put very little effort into writing and making it.  Well, it shows.

Really liked Harvest, LOVED Something Something, and wish Seth would have made this one half as good.  But it's not; it's exactly what he warns it to be: a half-ass piece of crap.  Boring, rarely funny, and criticizes the original Jedi movie constantly, even though I'd sit through a million hours of Jedi before I ever watched Trap again.  Whether you're a die-hard Star Wars fan or not, or a die-hard Family Guy fan, be forewarned that this video misses the mark by a mile and if you really must have it, wait till it goes on clearance at Walmart, which will probably be soon.

However, do love the playful jabs between MacFarlane and Seth Green at the end.  Have met both of them and Green is by far the nicer, cooler, and funnier of the two.

But...
There are some funny scenes in this and if you are a true fan of Family Guy, you will buy it. The majority of the humor seemed more like they were poking fun at holes in the plot of Star Wars than just having fun with their own characters. They even brought characters from Seth's other shows into this movie and made a joke at their own expense about it. Near the end, Chris and Peter do the traditional ""Seth Green bashing"" comments back and forth which were funny in the past but the whole, Robot Chicken vs. Family Guy thing is getting old. Now when Chris turns it back on Peter saying ""I hate Seth McFarlane."", I had to laugh.

As a fan of this parody, you knew there was going to be nothing new. The same old Family Guy characters and jokes and pop culture references galore.

Overall, the reproduction of the movie, especially the space scenes are very well done.  All of the Family Guy Star Wars parodies are funny, and they did a great job on this one.  Return of the Jedi is so bad in some areas that this parody is actually an improvement to it.

It's not as good as Blue Harvest or Something, Something, Something Dark Side, but it's quite watchable and entertaining.

The story begins with our heroes sitting around watching TV. The lights go out, Stewie says, ""Does this mean we're gonna do Jedi?"" and Peter says, ""Might as well get this over with."" From there we go to the opening crawl, wherein it's revealed, possibly accurately, that the Family Guy people didn't want to do this one. We go from there to the usual set of sight gags and familiar characters in new roles, including appearances by Roger, Klaus, Rallo and Tim the Bear. You get Meg in the expected spot, though the addition of someone very unexpected as the Rancor was quite fun.

There's several times I laughed out loud, including the Emperor's efforts to get Luke angry by dissing on Seth Green, or Peter/Han's efforts to make the movie ""darker"". While overall it wasn't quite as good as the other ones, or as funny as the TV series at its best, it was still very good and I feel happy that I bought it.

I spent several frustrating minutes trying before I gave up. There's also the expected commentary, a drawing lesson, ""sock puppet"" stuff and more! It's not something you'll really be likely to buy for the extras, but it's good to have them there.

Overall this was a purchase I was quite pleased with, and if you don't own the previous installments, you can get this, plus those, in a big ole boxed set set for a reasonable price. Not bad, and worth seeing!",1292976000,7,1787,4.47239263803681
4215941,5,B003X4KHRG,As a third and final installment of the Family Guy Star Wars this is a wonderful ending to the trilogy!!! I bought this the day it came out and rushed home to watch it an hour later I was laughing so hard I was spewing Soda out of my nose!!! This is a wonderful addition to any Family Guy Collection!!! I recomend this to every Family Guy Fan!!!,1292976000,5,345,4.088235294117647
4215942,1,B003X4KHRG,"I haven't even watched it yet because I'm so annoyed with the copy protection on this DVD.  You can't rip this DVD to watch it when and how you want.  Also, at least on a Mac, if you simply want to watch it you'll have to give over your admin password.  WTF is up with that?  I have to give a MOVIE admin privileges just in order to watch it on my computer?  Let me guess -- it will root my system so that I can't make a personal copy of this or any other movie ever again?  No thanks!

If you care about being able to watch your movies when and how you want, I suggest you avoid this one.",1292976000,5,589,3.8181818181818183
4215943,5,B003X4KHRG,If you love Family Guy and you love Star Wars it's a perfect mix.  I have enjoyed all 3 of the Family Guy Star Wars they are just good fun and crack me up.  I like how it basically spoofs the entire movie covering every major scene and just throwing jokes in.  If you are a fan of both it's just a nice treat you get to enjoy watching Star Wars yet also get that Family Guy laughter.,1292889600,3,383,3.8846153846153846
4215944,4,B003X4KHRG,"OK, I have been waiting to write this up.  I HOPE FOX READS THIS.  THE RELEASE DATE FOR THIS DVD.  TUESDAY 12-21-10.  Sure, I really wanted to go out in the Christmas shopping for the 2cd year in a row to buy this, like the Empire version 12-22-09.  Poor judgment Fox.

Of the original trilogy Jedi is the least popular & the same goes here.  They even cover this in the beginning story telling words on the screen.

 For us Star Wars fans we will appreciate Carrie who already does a character in the show does the voice of Mon Mothma.

We see a bit from ""Caddyshack"" & you will laugh at Conway Twitty in the Darth helmet.

It is funny BUT not laughs do not come as often as the first two installments.

Extras on this, it is a 1 disc DVD.  The digital copy is on the same DVD disc.

NO CHAPTER SEARCH LIST & OF COURSE THE OTHER THING I HATE.  THEY RELEASED THIS WITH ONE OF THOSE CHEAP DVD CASES WITH THE INTENTIONAL HOLES IN IT.  THESE THINGS ARE CHEAP & CAN DAMAGE YOUR DVD, JUST SO YOU WILL BE FORCED TO BUY ANOTHER.  HANDS UP WHO HATES THESE CASES?

""Star Wars"" & ""Family Guy"" fans should enjoy this but Seth Green may not.",1292889600,5,1129,4.10091743119266
4215945,1,B003X4KHRG,"This was terrible. I struggled to find anything at all humorous with this latest edition, which is hard to admit considering how much I liked the previous two. The beginning intro was not lying at the terrible quality of this release. I thought it was a joke, but watching it clearly shows it was completely serious.

We get, its crap, but by saying its crap, doesn't excuse it being crap. And the only thing that you should have added to this intro of scrolling text was, ""If you bought this DVD, you got screwed...""

Do NOT waste your money on this. You have been warned.",1292889600,9,573,4.447619047619048
4215946,3,B003X4KHRG,"I wish Amazon's rating system would include half stars. ""It's A Trap!"" is 3.5 stars, better than a 3 but not quite a 4. ""It's A Trap!"" is the final episode of ""Family Guy's"" faithful to the original retelling of ""Star Wars.""

Besides the usual ""Family Guy"" characters filling out the roles from ""Star Wars,"" Peter as Han Solo, Lois as Princess Leia (and just as hot in the slave girl costume as Carrie Fisher was). Creator Seth MacFarlane also borrows characters from his ""American Dad"" and ""The Cleveland Show."" The really amazing thing is how well the characters fit into the Star Wars characterizations, it's as if MacFarlane had this in mind all along.

Admitedly, ""It's A Trap!"" is the weakest in his trilogy but that doesn't mean the jokes aren't there. There are some jokes that skewer some of the plot holes in Star Wars, and there are some laugh out loud moments that will make up for its shortcomings. Sure they'll run a joke into the ground, or there will be gratuitously inappropriate comments, and Conway Twitty cameo's but that's why we love ""Family Guy"" for its excesses. Who can argue with Stewie being Darth Vader, the evilest kid in the galaxy.",1292889600,,1162,4.663414634146341
4215947,5,B003X4KHRG,"I haven't seen this movie, but while reading the reviews I saw that someone had rated it a one star based on something that had nothing to do with the quality of the movie. He hadn't seen it yet, but he marked it one star because some digital...well, he sorta whined a little bit and I stopped reading. If you rate anything on Amazon based on shipping, package quality or the inability to order it in your favorite medium (I'm looking at you, Kindle Readers) you should be banned from Amazon.",1292803200,11,492,4.417582417582418
4215948,4,B003X4KHRG,"I don't understand the negative reviews to this movie. It is every single bit as good as the first two, people are just being analytical for the sake of trying to stand apart.

I won't get into lengthy reviews, because I'm sure people already have.
Just watch it. It stays true to the feeling of the first two, and is consistently funny. American Dad fans will be in for a treat, as will people who remember the Ostrich and Angela. Great points are made, and Quag-3PO will make you laugh your *** off.

4/5 only because the Sarlaac Pit staring scene went on for way too long.",1292716800,12,575,4.364485981308412
4215949,5,B003X4KHRG,"I've haven't downloaded or watched yet. But out of everything Macfarlane has done I've didn't like 1 episode. Being the one where Brian and Stewie locked in the bank vault.
I actually cancelled this preorder and ordered the boxset. But I'm also keeping my old BH/SSSDS.
I'm going to watch this Tuesday when it arrives. Might watch it 2 or more times that day, with and without commentary.

I just watched this. And I laughed at least 20 times. Loved how Seth was ripping on Seth. There was one very dark scene that wasn't funny. But I really enjoyed this dvd.

Where's all the special features?
Dinner and a movie
The Comic Con
And deleted scenes

Just checked not listed on the dvd case.",1292544000,3,688,4.532258064516129
4215950,5,B003X4KHRG,"Unlike most of the reviews for this Family Star Wars installment, I actually thought it was hilarious! It starts with a crawl which admittedly wasn't that funny, but the rest was gold! Some of the gags that stick out in my head are: a scene where Quagmire/C3P0 sings the theme to Fresh Prince of Bel Air in Ewokese (the language spoken by the Ewoks in Star Wars). Then there's the ongoing inside jokes against Seth Green which are HILARIOUS, the Sarlacc Pit scene was very funny, oh and there's the scene where Chris/Luke is heading back to Dagobah to finish his training, and he asks Cleveland/Artoo ""if there is any Chips Ahoy left"", and Artoo says no, but Luke keeps hearing the noise of a cookie wrapper crumpling, and after the third time he flips the ship over and dumps all the cookies in space and says ""there now nobody can have em"".

I honestly don't get all the negative reviews. It had some hilarious jokes, the animation was beautiful. You guys need to lighten up. Especially the guy complaining about ""oh there's no digital copy, I guess that makes this a piece of crap"".

As pointed out in the special, that is not Seth MacFarlane's fault. Blame Fox, not Seth.",1292544000,5,1175,4.563981042654029
4215951,1,B003X4KHRG,"I read a few reviews on this and decided to download it and see if the film was really this bad before buying it.  IT STINKS!  If you hated Jedi, you will think it was a masterpiece when compared to this DVD.  When the beginning stated that Seth had ran out of ideas and was force by FOX to do this film, I knew it would be bad.  Now if you are desperate to buy this DVD to complete your collection, I would wait until it drops to $5.00 or less before buying it, because it is not worth the current price.  Personally I will be selling my copies of the first two after seeing this garbage, because I do not want it stinking up anything else I own.",1292457600,7,647,3.9844961240310077
4215952,2,B003X4KHRG,"This edition to the Star Wars parodies was a big let down. Seth even mentions in the opening that they basically ran out of ideas for this one and other things, after watching this its SO true. I will admit I did laugh at a few things but that doesn't say much. I recommend waiting for this one to get down to the $5 price range.",1292457600,5,329,4.0

When this ""DVD"" is inserted into DVD Player of an Apple Computer with the latest version of MAC OS, it DOES NOT APPEAR AS A DVD!!  An icon appears on the Desktop Screen, icon looks like the Cover Art shown for this Title; BUT in that 'Window' that appears, are offered two Menu Choices:  1) to play 'Digital' Movie using 'iTunes'  OR  2) to play 'Digital' Movie using 'DVD Player'  --unfortunately, NEITHER OPTION WORKS!!  BOTH choices create various error messages from whichever option you choose!  Apparently, this movie is in some sort of Proprietary Digital Format on the 'DVD' that can NOT be played without running the ""iTunes"" or ""DVD Player"" applications that are also ON THAT DISK!  Neither of which runs without crashing or generating a long 'Error Report'  Neither program ever reaches a point where you could enter the 'Security Code' number found on the insert inside the ""DVD"" Case, to ""unlock"" the program.  My speculation is, that MAYBE this Disk MIGHT play on the Version of MAC OS X in use when this Disk was released, back in 2010; which would be ""Snow Leopard""  --Apple has released at least SIX newer versions of their Operating System since this disk was first released, with each new OS Version incorperating numerous changes and alterations to the programs (iTunes or DVD Player) that this 'Digital' Copy of the Movie needs to run, such that this ""Disk"" will NOT RUN on current MAC Computer!!  I even tried 3 different separate copies of this Disk, and they're all the same; they do not run on current MAC OS Computers!  I have not had access to Windows PC to see if this DIsk would run on DVD Player attached to PC running 'Windows' Operating System.
