A few tense moments later, they live happily ever after. It's the same with this movie. Ronit Roy is superb and Farheen is lovely. They are passionately in love and will sing, dance and fight till the world leaves them alone, and how! The songs are outstanding and even after all these years, they never fail to tug at my heart strings (the heavenly combination of Kumar Sanu, Alka Yagnik, Nadeem-Shravan). Watch this movie with an open mind,",1305763200,,610,4.710280373831775
