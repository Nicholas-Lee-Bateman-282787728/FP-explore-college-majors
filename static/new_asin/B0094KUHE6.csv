8535996,5,B0094KUHE6,Received an early copy of your DVD and wow did you capture some great footage of monster bulls. I especially liked the 8x8 what a magnificent creature. I have lived in elk country most of my life and have spent many hours in the back country and was taken back with so many different bulls that were truly trophies. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys wildlife and especially to those who love to see huge bulls all worked up and ready to defend their cows. Great work...,1348012800,2,483,4.377777777777778
