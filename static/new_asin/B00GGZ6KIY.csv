6075465,1,B00GGZ6KIY,Bait and switch. Wholly disappointing. No full songs. Not even a decent critique. Worthless. Mine is in the garbage too.,1435536000,32,120,5.05

8623006,2,B00GGZ6KIY,Should have paid attention to the site reviews before buying this; sucked and had a weird ending that just cut off. Looks like someone burned it on their own dvd burner.,1499731200,5,169,4.483870967741935
