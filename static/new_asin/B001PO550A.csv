3753677,5,B001PO550A,"This is an excellent DVD.  Quality is superb.  What a joy to be able to see 4 great musicals together- Show Boat, Annie Get Your Gun, Kiss Me Kate, and 7 Brides For 7 Brothers.  Superb dancing, superb music.  Chance to see that wonderful dance number with Bob Fosse and Carol Haney (among others)in ""Kate"" & the humorous number ""Brush Up Your Shakespeare"" done by gangsters Keenan Wynn & James Whitmore.  And nothing compares to the magnificent athletic dance number in ""7 Brides"". Can't go wrong with this collection.",1258675200,3,518,4.775280898876405

SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS: Jane Powell and Howard Keel star in this lusty musical favourite with a particularly sweeping Johnny Mercer/Gene DePaul score.  Special Features:  audio commentary with director Stanley Donen, and a Donen musicals trailer gallery.

ANNIE GET YOUR GUN: Musical dynamo Betty Hutton fires on all cylinders with her performance as sharp-shootin' Annie Oakley in the celebrated screen version of the Broadway musical, co-starring Howard Keel.  Special Features: all-new introduction by Susan Lucci, deleted musical number ""Let's Go West Again"", three songs with original star Judy Garland (""Doin' What Comes Natur'lly"", ""I'm An Indian, Too"" and ""Colonel Buffalo Bill""), audio session tracks.

SHOW BOAT:  The most beloved and popular screen version of the Broadway musical, starring Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel as lovers Magnolia and Ravenal, torn apart and reunited on the Cotton Blossom.  Ava Gardner aquits herself nicely in a rare musical role, although her singing was dubbed by Annette Warren.  Special Features: trailer.

KISS ME, KATE:  Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel are again paired in this solid movie version of the Cole Porter musical, about a divorced pair of actors forced to work together again in a stage production of Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"".  Special Features:  all-new featurette ""Cole Porter in Hollywood: Too Darn Hot"" hosted by Ann Miller, vintage short ""Mighty Manhattan, New York's Wonder City"", trailer, behind-the-scenes notes.",1245628800,79,1723,5.428571428571429

3753685,2,B001PO550A,"Each year around Mother's Day  WB release a set of the great MGM musicals of the past. This year they have opted to only re release already released prints (I don't think you will find this ""Showboat""is the upgraded version at all). Why????? This is a real disappointment when there are still many great MGM musicals that have never been released on DVD. Yes I think we shall soon see ""Showboat""in all 3 versions and that will be great, but what about ""The Student Prince"", ""The Great Carouso"", ""Athena"", ""Give a Girl a Break""(with Fosse doing all that great dancing), ""Invitation to the Dance"" to name a few, that would have made a perfect set this year????",1240444800,8,658,4.6239316239316235
3753686,4,B001PO550A,"It is odd that Warner Home Video chose ""Broadway Musicals"" instead of some other category of musicals for a collection. This is TCM/WHV's attempt to bring the classic films to DVD cheaply, and it's a noble cause. The one film in this bunch I don't care for is ""Annie Get Your Gun"". I'm not going to blame Betty Hutton for this one. She actually got the part and I don't think Judy Garland would have done a better job. Actually, the problem is Howard Keel, who is the leading man in all four of these films. He was a real disappointment here. For those who like all of the trimmings there is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Brides-for-Seven-Brothers-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0002OXVCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;versus the plain version here. WHV owns all of the versions of Showboat on film, and in my opinion the 1951 version you get here is weaker than the 1936 version - not currently on DVD - mainly because Howard Keel's character is supposed to be a tower of Jello, and it is just too much of a suspense of belief to believe Howard Keel as such a character. Finally, ""Kiss Me Kate"" is a fantastic musical that plays to all of Howard Keel's strengths. It already exists in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Classic-Musicals-Collection-The-Cole-Porter-Gift-Set-High-Society-Kiss-Me-Kate-Les-Girls-Broadway-Melody-of-1940-Silk-Stockings/dp/B00008WQ9L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Classic Musicals Collection - The Cole Porter Gift Set (High Society / Kiss Me Kate / Les Girls / Broadway Melody of 1940 / Silk Stockings)</a>, again for those of you who like all of the trimmings and extras.

For those of you who buy WHV classics on a regular basis I'm going to tell you why I'd hold off on this one. It's a suspicion of mine. TCM is scheduled to show the 1929 version of Showboat in April. They have been showing an upgraded version of the 1951 version, which I assume you get here versus the older rather washed-out one. In December 2007 TCM aired the 1936 version of Showboat (the best version in my opinion) and the voiceover introduction mentioned that there was a commentary track embedded in the film. WHV has been promising the 1929/1936/1951 versions of Showboat for two years now. Nobody - not even TCM - shows a 1929 part-talkie musical (1929's Showboat) for the fun of it. Nobody installs a commentary track in a 73 year old film for the fun of it either. I suspect WHV is getting ready to announce the long-awaited trilogy of Showboat movies. That is worth waiting for.",1233964800,11,2649,5.398550724637682

Politics aside, it is a cute, entertaining story. ""Showboat"" is a story that resonates with me personally, and it is the reason I bought the collection.

3754154,5,B001PO550A,"This is a most enjoyable package in color and with subtitles. The price is right and the entertainment is top notch.

Howard Keel is in all four of these movies and the first one I watched is one of my all time favorite movies - Show Boat. His performance with Kathryn Grayson singing Only Make Believe is probably my very favorite Howard Keel moment. Kathryn Grayson makes an outstanding number even better. Ava Gardner gives a splendid performance as she always does. Marge and Gower Champion are the icing on the cake with their remarkable dancing ability.

The second most enjoyable movie, to me, is Kiss Me Kate. Kathryn Grayson joins Howard Keel in singing Cole Porter hits the way they were intended to be sung.

I watched Seven Brides For Seven Brothers next. Jane Powell did an excellent performance and was easily the star of the show. What was a disappointment to me was the music just did not have the pizazz found in he other three movies. However, just watching the outstanding performance of Jane Powell was worth the viewing effort.

Annie Get Your Gun is a definite winner. I have no doubt that in tis day and age there are those who will not accept this as a classis musical but rather a mistreatment of an ethnic group. However, Betty Hutton gave a bravo performance in this movie and blended nicely with Howard Keel. Hearing some of the Irving Berlin favorites was indeed a pleasure.",1427846400,7,1403,4.645161290322581

3754314,5,B001PO550A,"Actually, it would have been more accurate to name this set of four wonderful color MGM musicals from the early Fifties the ""Howard Keel Collection"" because he stars in all four musicals, and the latest of the four, the widescreen SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS was written for the screen, not brought from Broadway.  What is indisputable is that they are all fine movie musicals, and now available at a very good price.

Even today, ANNIE GET YOUR GUN (1950) is the movie that sometimes arouses controversy, because Betty Hutton was brought in for the starring role which MGM had originally given to Judy Garland.  That didn't work, though, and what resulted has to be considered a success nonetheless; in fact, Hutton did a fine job as Annie Oakley paired with Howard Keel's Frank Butler.  Songs include ""Anything You Can Do, I Can Do Better"" and ""You Can't Get A Man With A Gun.""

SHOW BOAT (1951) is subject to some criticism, because the original 1927 stage musical (and the first screen adaptation, in 1936) hit the themes of racial discrimination and the mixed blessings of show business a little harder, but there's no denying this Technicolor adaptation was a success.  Songs include ""Make Believe"" and Paul Warfield's ""Old Man River.""  Keel and Kathryn Grayson star, and are backed by a colorful supporting cast that includes Joe E. Brown and Agnes Moorehead.

KISS ME KATE (1953) is that fairly rare adaptation of Cole Porter's from the stage that kept almost all its songs intact.  In fact, an extra song-and-dance number ""From This Moment On,"" originally cut from the Porter show OUT OF THIS WORLD, provided an excellent opporunity for Ann Miller, Jeanne Coyne and Carol Haney to dance with Tommy Rall, Bobby Van and Bob Fosse.  Kathryn Grayson and Keel star as feuding divorcees, actors in the show-within-a-show based on ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" who rediscover their love.  Keenan Wynn and James Whitmore nearly steal the show as two gangsters out to enforce an IOU.  Look quick for choreographer Hermes Pan as a sailor after the ""Always True to You in My Fashion"" number.  Songs include ""Wunderbar"" and ""So In Love.""

And finally, the widescreen SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS (1954) combines Howard Keel as Adam Pontipee, family patriarch, with six lonely brothers.  Adam carries out a plan based on the ""Rape of the Sabine Women"" myth and engineers a kidnapping of six brides, who remain housebound all winter, to the consternation of Adam's wife Milly (Jane Powell).  A colorful  original with great Johnny Mercer lyrics and Michael Kidd choreography that really puts the widescreen to use.  Supporting actors include Tommy Rall, Jeff Richards, Jacques D'Amboise, Russ Tamblyn, and Julie Newmar (billed as Julie Newmeyer).  Something special.  Songs include ""Goin' Courtin'"" and ""Lonesome Polecat.""

Trivia Note:  The producers at MGM must have thought Howard Keel looked better in facial hair:  after ANNIE GET YOUR GUN, MGM kept him in it through most of the following three  pictures.",1414800000,2,3010,4.997991967871486

The humor, some of it hokey by today's standards, stood the test of time and was laugh out loud funny. The humor in ""Annie Get Your Gun"" and ""Kiss me Kate"" was more than good with very little unintential humor.

3754414,3,B001PO550A,"As a music theatre coach, I have collected many musicals.  TCM's collection has four great movies:  Show Boat, Annie Get your Gun, Kiss Me Kate and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers

The problem, very mediocre packaging, not liner note booklet with historical notes, no extras, in other words just the movies thrown together in cheap packaging.

Great to have the movies but would have preferred if TCM would educate their public fans with great liner notes, historical facts. and extras like documentary on the making, history from Broadway show to MGM movie, Rodgers and Hammerstein bio etc.

It feels thrown together.. of the Target bind variety.  Yet still a good collection of movies.

Show Boat has a great cast of actors that play here and are remarkable singers and dancers.  Next is Annie Get Your Gun.  In the very beginning, I didn't think I was going to like it, but after you get over the very start, the rest of the story is great.  The last one. Kiss Me Kate, I didn't care for at all, it was too boring for me.  It still had a lot of singing but most of the story took place in a play that they were in.",1372204800,,779,3.917197452229299

Show Boat, Annie Get Your Gun, Kiss Me Kate, and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers are some of the best Hollywood musicals ever produced and the sumptuous production quality of MGM is absolutely dreamy.  The downside of this TCM collection is that you get 1 clamshell where you are expected to stack the 4 disks on top of each other -- this is a no-no in my books.  You can get oils from the top of 1 disk and smudged / scratch the disk above/below.  Who was the genius who thought of this idea seriously was thinking of other ways to get people to buy more versions of this collection.  I'm going to be buying different / individual clamshells for the movies and replacing the dud of a package.  Other than that, it's a good buy.",1370822400,5,813,4.281045751633987

Seven Brides for Seven Brothers is great film and I am honored to own it. Showboat at first I didn't think I was going to enjoy it but when it started going a bit furthur into the depths of the characters I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and when they sang ""Ole Man River"" at the end I was literally crying my eyes out. Then I thought that I had saved the best for last Kiss Me Kate was a story within a story of William Shakespear's The Taming of The Shrew. I popped it in my dvd player and this movie came to life and they sang a song, 5 words later they sang another song 7 words later they sang another song there must have been 30 songs in this movie ( I didn't really count )but like I said I am a musical lover but I do think that there can be too much singing in one movie and not enough dialouge to move the STORY aloung.

This set has 4 DVDs, and are clearly marked (the former set looked like blank DVDs...I had to put the title on them with a Sharpie).  However, only 3/4 titles work.

My only complaint is that all 4 discs were on the same latch - one on top of the other.  I have bought sets such as this, from other manufacturers and usually each disc is on a separate place.  The way these are packaged could cause discs to be scratched.  They are good copies why skimp on the packaging and possibly cause damage??

You turn it on one side for one movie, and then you flip it over for another movie. I got the discs for Christmas and by April quite of few of them were scratched. I don't think these are very dependable at all. I treated them very carefully and I am not one to leave discs out and forgotten. I loved Annie get your gun and have seen it along with many of my kids, but I was only able to play it about 5 times before it had a weird ring around it and my dvd player has never done that to any other of my dvds.

3754682,4,B001PO550A,"Overall, these ""TCM Greatest..."" collections are nice sets (I have several others along with this one). They are clean copies, have a little bit of nice bonus material (not greatly in-depth like some people like, but nice), and they're more than reasonably priced.  The only disappointment is that they're panned & scanned versions of the films.  For all TCM promotes the letterbox/widescreen versions of films - ""as the films' directors intended them to be seen"" - it's a little disappointing for them to put their name on these.  Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, for example, is one of the films TCM uses as an example in its own material on why people should be watching films in letterbox. I'll still watch these films over and over, but I expected just a little better from TCM.",1298332800,43,783,4.785185185185185

Show Boat not only has the wonderful voices of Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson, but Ava Gardner and Marge and Gower Champion, an unforgettable dance team. For those not familiar with Betty Hutton I think her role as sharp shooter Annie Oakley in Annie Get Your Gun is her best. Kiss Me Kate is a very cleverly done play within a play based on The Taming of The Shrew. (Brush Up Your Shakespeare) Howard Keel is the leading man in all 4 of these musicals including the lovable, unforgettable Seven Brides For Seven Brothers.

With his divine voice, handsome face and terrific physique (only improved by wearing tights in Kiss Me Kate), he simply takes over every scene in which he makes an entrance.  These films are 4 of the very best Broadway musicals ever translated to the big screen - and what a pleasure to watch Howard Keel lend his immense talent to 4 very different roles, each one a treat in itself.

The set came labeled as containing 2 Single-sided DVDs with additional features. What is inside are 4 DVDs, one copy of each film. Three of the films are good clean copies, with varying degrees of crispness due to the age of the master used. However, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the DVD copy of Show Boat.
The action onscreen is jerky and obviously not a copy from an original clean master. It is often out of sync with the soundtrack, made more obvious in close ups. My initial thought is that this might be an illegal print, however it does not have any other problems I have experienced with bootleg copies, plus it has the paint label with Warner Brothers logo on the disc. Quite frankly, the VHS tape I discarded as this DVD was to replace it) had a better quality image and soundtrack match. It is difficult to watch, giving me a headache as a result.
