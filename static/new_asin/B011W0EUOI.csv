THERE WAS NO INFORMATION WITH THE INFO PLACED WITH THE AMAZON AD.  THERE IS NO TRACK LISTING OR ANY WAY TO SKIP TO ANOTHER SONG.  WHY ITS SOLD AS A  AUDIO-DVD, I'LL NEVER KNOW.  CD FOR SINGING- YES,  BUT FOR THE DVD PART--- VERY CRAZY BRIGHT 'HYPNOTIC SWIRLING OBJECTS, THAT WILL GIVE YOU A BAD HEADACHE IF YOU ARE STUPID ENOUGH TO WATCH THEM.

8725151,5,B011W0EUOI,"Ken Curtis had a fabulous voice and the songs he sang lead with The Sons Of The Pioneers will vouch for that. He had a minor hit with Tommy Dorcey in 1941,when he briefly replaced Frank Sinatra. Dorcey had him under contract when he leased Ken to sing with Shep Fields band and recorded Ken with The Pied Pipers. Ken also sang The Marine Corp.theme for a W.W.2 film,which promoted the armed forces after Pearl Harbor was bombed. Many of these gems were song by other vocalists such as Bob Nolan,Lloyd Perrymen and Tommy Doss. Get it you will love it.",1444608000,2,550,4.455445544554456
