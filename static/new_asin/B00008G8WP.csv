Quality of their unrestored movie transfers varies from fair to good, based on condition of film stock and source material (often old 16mm broadcast prints). The only extras provided are a catalog insert and DVD-accessible title list.

UNDERSEA KINGDOM is a cheesy/fun 12-part Republic Pictures 'Crash' Corrigan cliffhanger serial in which then-unknown Lon Chaney was billed as part of the ""also"" cast. (Note: some of the chapter-ending teasers bear little resemblance to the starts of the following installments, that is, they're ""cheaters"".)

Here, an evil ruler (Blue) who wants to destroy both the city of Atlantis and all life above-water, watches events as they unfold on the latest technical innovation: a big screen TV. A horn-blaring auto in a squared-off tin sheath serves as a mobile battering ram called the Juggernaut.

Submerged world sequences shot on Corrigan's scrubland California ranch feature herds of galloping horses and neo-ancient warriors in glued-on-glitter military hats, capes and short skirts. This was also the Republic debut of robot men made from silver-painted cardboard tubes.

Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.

7983251,5,B00008G8WP,"This calls out for a rainy Saturday afternoon and a bucket of popcorn. It starts with a thin premise - go deep enough into the ocean and you'll find dry land. No matter, it's what comes after that counts. Swords and ray guns! Robots and chariot chases! Evil overlord, bent on world domination! Plucky young lad, heroic hero, and an ornamental if mostly useless damsel! Fight scenes that look like puppies wrestling!

This comes from the same era as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flash-Gordon/dp/B005JVRT6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flash Gordon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buck-Rogers/dp/B002KVSJ6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buck Rogers</a>, and shares their delightfully cheesy aura. And, production values (such as they are) are at least as good as in those classics, maybe better. (If you've seen some of the more unfortunate serials from that era, you'll appreciate the difference.) One small detail caught my attention, too: the evil emperor's henchman with belt-mounted control box seems like the grandfather in spirit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lando-Calrissian-s/dp/B0006VIXGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lando Calrissian's</a>&nbsp;cyborg aide. I wouldn't be surprised if Lucas had, at some impressionable age, seen this, subconsciously internalized it, and reused the parts in his own masterpieces.

I'm not sure why this has fallen into obscurity, when Flash and Buck remain so well known. This deserves a place beside them in and movie collection.

7983253,5,B00008G8WP,"The Undersea Kingdom is a classic among serials.  Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan is a handsome stud, who wrestles,tightropes, climbs, and fences his way to victory for 12 chapters.  The special effects are slick and still look good today.  Particularly impressive are the (attractive) submarine, and the unique Volplane airships.  Additionally, the Vokite robots are interesting servants, rather than stereotypical ""mean"" mechanical men.  Ray gun effects are well done too.  The tank-like Juggernaut is a real vehicle with a turbine-like sound which is used to good advantage.  Mixed in with all of this technology are horses, chariots and sword and bow and arrow-weilding soldiers!  Though all of this takes place in the sunken world of Atlantis, there are trees, lakes and clouds everywhere!  Nevertheless, this serial creates a unique ""lost civilization"" feeling of escapism.  The costumes might seem outrageous, but help contribute to the feeling of isolation of this society.  Also, the serial lacks contemporary frames of reference (such as cars and clothing styles) which keeps it timeless.  As noted elsewhere, there is a lot of beefcake in the vein of early sixties Italian sword and sandal epics.  Crash is surrounded by scantily-clad warriors and prisoners.  (Check out the two gladiators under the chariot!)  Billy, the boy, is a resourceful character aptly played by Lee Van Atta.  He looks to be about nine years old, while his father, Professor Norton, looks to be about 80!  My best reference for The Undersea Kingdom is that it is boisterously entertaining.  And that's what it is all about.  ""Go ahead and ram!""",1101340800,7,1619,5.229571984435798
