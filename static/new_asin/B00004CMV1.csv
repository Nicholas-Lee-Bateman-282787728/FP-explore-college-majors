I've had the whole series on my computer for a long time, but they were downloaded from a questionable source and were not very good quality.  The video quality on this DVD set is excellent.  While I seriously doubt that the episodes were remastered, they look like it.  These Time Trax DVD sets are a bit pricey, but it's a niche product so a higher price point is to be expected, in my opinion.

I finished watching all of Season 1. The problem was that on every disc, only the first two episodes would play. The remaining episodes would either freeze or the DVD player could not read it. To be fair, I have four DVD Players and tried the Disc's on all four players. It had the same problem on all of the players. I probably will wait to see if Warner Brothers releases Season 2.

1340649,5,B00004CMV1,When this series first came on TV I got hooked on it about a man who is from the future that has to go back in time two hundred years to catch criminals from his time and send them back to their time to stand trial and sentenced for their crimes.  Darien has a lot to learn about the 1990's lifestyle and habits of the people especially the language.  He runs into Mordicai Sahmbi several times one of them even makes Darien doubt whether Sahmbi is a criminal or just created by society to be a bad person.

1340651,5,B00004CMV1,"I really enjoyed this series as a kid, and waited a long time for this show to be out finally on DVD.  I was fortunate enough to find it here on Amazon.com.  Like a number of shows the general theme and plot remain the same, hero has cool futuristic gadgets that help him fight the villain of the week.  What I liked about this show was the fantasy plot where he came from the future, to fight villains from his time in a modern world where he is a stranger in a strange land (but to everyone else is the normal present day world).  It seemed clear to me that the ""Van Dame"" film copied this same plot line, or maybe this show copied their's, either way this theme works well for me and I hope they make this one into a new ""2010's"" era film.  Actress Mia Sara, who starred in 80's movies including one with Tom Cruise, in particular is gorgeous and also perfect for the role of a damsel in distress.",1395532800,,900,4.149425287356322

1340656,1,B00004CMV1,"Ten or so years ago I pitched a concept I called Time Trax (or 'Tracks', I can't remember) to a 20th Century Fox TV producer heavy- weight. And here's an amazing coincidence: My concept pitch (with TV director David Orr) and this two-season wonder are only a mere millimeter apart in virtually every aspect. It's just Fate. Fate forked me.

To talk about this Time Trax specifically: Naturally l love my concept and glad for this  production's well-placed talents and resources (it offers great acting, plotting, directing; everything top drawer.... If my name was on it I'd give TIME TRAX five stars and a big hug. I filed my original treatment with the Writer's Guild in LA in the 70's; I wonder, is it still in their stacks? (Shrug), bygones.

I stress Time Trax's producer isn't who we pitched to. (No names, such Hollywood guys have Hollywood lawyers) Same 20th lot? I dunno. After so much time - I retired at 40 - now am 73. My life's been good, maybe better, because of Fate's twist. So strange Fate aside, I'm nicely afloat and moved on. But maybe here's a lesson for writers in this quick tale. Could be coincidences happen like that brown stuff.

(Oh, Amazon Guidelines coincidentally allow me my indulgence here. I can add that this TIME TRAX
comes from the merging of both fine concept and execution. If you're into Sci-Fi action adventures, you'll
like this. Whoever created and wrote the concept should be proud. I am. Remotely.  rc",1392768000,3,1446,4.699604743083004

5 stars for the SERIES.

I live in the UK.  I used to watch this on ITV back in 1994 and have awaited a full series release ever since.

You can imagine how much I wanted this product but alas the materials (Dual-Layer DVD-R used for high capacity MOD DVD discs) were not up to an acceptable standard!

My DVDs arrived promptly but disc 1 was both badly scratched and entire chapters were unplayable.

In my experience, any content requiring single layer DVD-R discs (i.e. less than 2 hours of content) should be fine but multi-episode dual-layer dvd-r recorded media from Warner Archive is unreliable.

All my MOD animated movies including Rankin/Bass' The Flight of Dragons & the 7 remaining unreleased (on DVD) Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10 movies from 1987-88 (The Jetsons Meet The Flintstones, etc) play perfectly.  Long may they continue to do so!

I do own The Jetsons Season 2 Volume 2 on MOD Discs (3 disc set) and it is working fine (so far).  So not all multi-episode (dual-layer?) discs are c***.

Be aware that feedback on MOD titles here at amazon.com is not exactly glowing or consistant!

I would still like to buy The Pirates of Dark Water but again disc one is reported as faulty by too many customers who have purchased the item. Not sure if I should risk it???

Jetsons S2 V2 - OK
Time Trax S1 - EPIC FAIL!

It all comes down to how much of a risk you'd like to take for this officially licenced Warner Home Video/Warner Archive product.  International customers should be careful.

Final advice - If the content has 2hrs R/T or under 3rd parties (marketplace sellers) are OK but if any higher, in the case of Time Trax this is approximately 3 hours per disc (for the most part), then you should ORDER DIRECTLY FROM AMAZON.COM for ease of return, refund or replacement if you get a dud disc in your copy.

Amazon decided to refund my order costs rather than sending a replacement copy.

Warner Archive MOD Discs should play (reported as region free) on a compatible device/machine/player regardless of the customers' geographical region or location.

This was the first Warner Acrchive title I had any trouble playing.

Note: playback on future devices is not assured (Blu-Ray Disc Players and beyond) so I'd recommend buying or maintaining a machine that does play them.

Best of luck.",1355788800,35,2329,4.701234567901235

1340699,5,B00004CMV1,I think that some of the oldies wait until no one know what really was. When MI came out took about 4 seasons to catch one. Why  the studio jst let us have them all available would make dolloars and sense to the studios but5 no we wait. I personally can not wait but I waill to buy it all,1276300800,,288,3.8
7920315,5,B00004CMV1,"I discovered Time Trax sort of by accident. I watched an episode specifically because I liked an actor who was guest starring in that particular episode, and immediately fell in love with the series. I wasn't expecting much because most of the time when I do that the show ends up being garbage, and the actor I'm watching it for is lucky if they get two minutes of screen time. With this one I was pleasantly surprised though, not only because it was a terrific show, but because it starred one of my favorite actors Dale Midkiff. Pet Sematary is one of my all-time favorite movies so finding out Dale Midkiff was the star of Time Trax was just icing on the cake. Dale plays Darien Lambert, a detective from the future (2193) sent back in time to apprehend criminals who have escaped into the past (1993) using a time machine called TRAX. Being from the future Darien possesses superior abilities, and is assisted by SELMA (Elizabeth Alexander), an advanced computer disguised as a credit card that he communicates with by way of a holographic interface. Lambert is also equipped with a weapon disguised as a keyless car alarm remote, which he uses to transport the criminals he catches back to the future. The main antagonist of the series is Dr. Mordecai Sahmbi (Peter Donat), the man who invented the TRAX time machine and used it to help the criminals Darien is chasing escape into the past. Each episode is a roller coaster of a good time that will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. The only complaint that I can really level against the show is that it is a product of it's time, and as such the special effects have aged rather badly, but that certainly doesn't take away from my enjoyment of the show, and it shouldn't take away from anyone else's either. I'd go so far as to say that this is a must watch for anyone who is a fan of futuristic sci-fi. As far as mid 90's sci-fi shows go you'd be hard pressed to find one better than this. I'd also recommend Time Trax to anyone who simply loves time travel. The show poses some interesting questions in regards to parallel timelines, and implies that time travelers actually travel to an alternate past so that they can in no way effect future events. Pretty cool. This is one of Dale Midkiff's better roles, so any fan of his definitely needs to check this out. The man is a criminally underrated actor, and this show like so many other of his performances proves that. It really is a shame that only two seasons of Time Trax were ever produced, because a show this fantastic deserves so many more than that. Sadly it seems Time Trax was fated to become one of those short-lived shows destined to be forgotten, and that really is a shame because this one is certainly worth remembering.",1517356800,2,2769,4.506958250497018

He catches crooks from 2193(100 years ahead of when this show was on)I LOVED it during its original run. I could cry that it was only on for one  season. If you love cool sci-Chou MUST see this show!
