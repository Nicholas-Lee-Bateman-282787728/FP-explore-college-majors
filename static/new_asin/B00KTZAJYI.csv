6447323,5,B00KTZAJYI,"This is my second favorite Yu-Gi-Oh series, the first being the original Yu-Gi-Oh. I did not watch the others.
The first disc contains 8 episodes. Both discs have cover art. The episodes have the intro, and the main menu has the theme song playing but with no words. There are no special features. Each episode is exactly like the one I watched on Saturday mornings.
I really like this show especially because it introduces the xyz monsters.",1422748800,,441,4.740259740259741
6447324,5,B00KTZAJYI,This is the english dub version as presented by Vortexx on the CW-kids Saturday morning cartoon time slot.  If that's what you want then here it is.  If you are looking for the original Japanese version with subtitles you must look elsewhere.  Yes the voices sound squeaky and there has been some alteration of the program but the basic story remains the same.  Its very enjoyable and will get better the farther along you go.,1415577600,,426,4.64
6447325,5,B00KTZAJYI,"For anyone that watched the original series of Yu-Gi-Oh, you will love this new season of this newer series. While the series ran from 2008-2013, this is a series I really did not know much about. In watching this with my kids I thought it was great. There is some great action throughout, dueling definitely, but also good characters and actors that develop their characters too. I could tell that you definitely do need to watch this series in order as the plot is complex and anyone that just tried to jump in mid season might be a bit confused. However, if you do start from the beginning you will definitely be drawn in and I, for one, was kept engaged throughout this DVD and so were my kids. Now my kids are asking for more, so it is off to try and find additional DVDs to watch together in the future!

6447326,5,B00KTZAJYI,"Most of the reviews here are not for Zexal or this DVD. They're written by misinformed people whining and complaining about a variety of topics. So if you're one of those people

-This Zexal half-season DVD is not slowing down the full season releases in any way; GX 1 is scheduled for October. If you're a Yu-Gi-Oh fan, stop complaining and be glad we're finally getting so many releases now. From 2008 through 2013 we got NOTHING!

-4K Media =/= 4Kids. It's part of Konami, who releases the cards.

-GX and 5D's will still be released in order.

-As far as the quality of the voice acting (across all Yu-Gi-Oh series), it is nowhere near as terrible as people here are claiming. It actually sounds pretty good. Yes, the dub is edited. Don't like it, don't buy it. If you haven't learned to expect and accept that at some point over the last 10-15 years, well

And as for the actual show we're supposed to be reviewing here, it's great. Good dueling, likable characters, and a surprisingly deep and complex storyline to accompany. These episodes are more of an introduction than anything. The series picks up around Episode 20 (next volume) or so. There are some segments that are reminiscent of the previous three series, but Zexal is certainly its own Yu-Gi-Oh. If you haven't seen Zexal for some reason, check it out.",1410912000,7,1321,4.652360515021459
6447327,1,B00KTZAJYI,"Terrible dub. The main character Yuma sounds just like Justin Bieber, but more childish. Quit watching when I heard his voice and my when my ears started to bleed.

Keep your money for the Japanese import.",1410825600,,205,4.694444444444445
6447328,5,B00KTZAJYI,Cinedigm is releasing gx and 5ds in season sets my guess as to why zexal is only being released in volumes is because episodes are still being dubbed and maybe they want to release zexal to dvd seeing as it is the most current yugioh series in the us and also to drag out the dvd releases so they can finish the dub hope they dub the rest of gx and 5ds too but we'll just have to wait and see either way I'm buying these dvds to show my support and possibly help fund an uncut version or a release of the japanese version in the future,1408320000,2,535,3.962962962962963
6447329,3,B00KTZAJYI,"I'm glade another series is coming out, but agree with the others. Why did they choose to not make them in order. They better at least before making the other half of this season make the 1st half of the first season of 5ds and gx after that and then when ARC V comes in english dud on tv, they better have all 3 series completely finished before that.",1403222400,,352,4.115942028985507
6447330,2,B00KTZAJYI,"I'm going to be hopeful that they decided to skip over 5DS and GX only because those two have some episodes that were never dubbed into English - these releases feature only the Anglicised versions, not the original Japanese with subs (an opportunity missed indeed)  - and are being held back until Cinedigm (who now own New Video Group and the rights to Yu Gi Oh) can dub them for a release.

If they're not going to do GX or 5DS at all then a huge THUMBS DOWN!

And why are they apparently going to do Zexal as ""volume"" releases whilst Classic was done in season sets? It makes no sense and will look messy on the shelf. You'd think the message would have gotten through by now; collectors love two things: consistency and completeness. I want my Yu Goi Oh collection to be complete and in season sets and for the boxes to match!

A two-disc ""volume"" of Zexal is about half a season. Not only is that not consistent with previous releases, it will really slow down things down if half-seasons are going to come out at the samr speed as full seasons did.

And what's the betting when they;ve done them as ""volumes"", a ""complete"" set will then release?",1403222400,,1152,4.415094339622642
6447331,1,B00KTZAJYI,"im going to buy this but it has pissed me off they skiped to this over doing yugioh gx and 5ds first cuz those are way better then this one i would rether yugioh gx first then yugioh 5ds 2nd, and then they should have released this one last cuz gx and 5ds are my favorites",1402272000,3,272,3.875
6447332,5,B00KTZAJYI,"Absolutely love this series. I didn't watch every episode when they played on t.v so this is good for me. It brings the xyz monsters, and number cards. Most characters are childish but I can deal with it. The villains in this are mostly cynical.
Each volume has 2 discs. The discs have nice art.
I was glad it arrived on time.",1430956800,,326,4.274193548387097
6447333,4,B00KTZAJYI,"* I received a review copy of this show in exchange for an honest review

I have to confess up front Ive been collecting Yu-Gi-Oh! cards for several years now.  I don't play the game, but I am drawn to the cards because of the imaginative characters and creatures, as well as the impressive artwork.  Ive never watched any of the Yu-Gi-Oh! TV series before either, but Ive been meaning to; for some reason, Ive always had something else to watch instead.  So when the fine folks at Cinedigm sent the press release for a recent Yu-Gi-Oh! series titled Zexal, I jumped at the chance to watch it.  Im glad I did, too.  YU-GI-OH!: ZEXAL is a fun anime series that will appeal to both young and old.

After watching Zexal, I think I might have to try my hand at actually playing the game.  From what Ive been told, Ive amassed some pretty powerful cards, so I might be a formidable opponent someday.  And if the game is half as fun as this show, then Im in for a real treat!

YU-GI-OH!: ZEXAL is both vivid and intense, a cartoon series that is just as serious as it is campy.  The characters are larger than life, particularly Yuma, who cant decide if hes a man in a boys body or a just a wannabe duelist who is trying to tread water in a sea of talented card-slingers.  Yumas over-the-top antics are half of what make this show fun, although some of his inner dialogue can be painful at times.

The show itself looks great, with well drawn monsters straight from the game cards.  I like the diversity of the cards/creatures used, as it really opens the eyes to those not initiated with the actual game.  Likewise, the newer monsters are powerful and cool, welcome additions to an already impressive canon of beasties.

YU-GI-OH!: ZEXAL is a win for me, and fans of Saturday morning anime cartoons should love it.  The 3-disc set of season one is packaged in a nice, albeit plain, box case, so it should look nice on any collectors shelf.  The series hits stores tomorrow, so make a note.",1430697600,,1984,4.418732782369146
6447334,5,B00KTZAJYI,i cant wait to buy this i think yugioh zexal isn't that bad its ok but i like the other yugioh series more so i hope after this releases i hope yugioh gx season 2 and 5ds season 2 i hope they release those on dvd next i wanna own all the yugioh series in my collection so i really hope they release all the yugioh gx and 5ds seasons after this and finish releasing zexal as well ill buy them all right if they do,1428710400,,412,3.802325581395349
6447335,2,B00KTZAJYI,"I personally think and I say this every time, this series was bad. The original 5 seasons of Yu-Gi-Oh will always be the best. I did think Yu-Gi-Oh GX was good but not as good as the original but way better than 5DS and Zexal. I mean I'm glad they will release the DVD for the fans of the show but I'm not going to buy it. :(",1428105600,,325,3.7941176470588234

6447337,5,B00KTZAJYI,"Yugioh zexal is my favorite yugioh series. It just makes me overall very happy and I think it's a enjoyable series for any age. I just wanted to say this because I saw a rather negative review trying to say this wasn't worth you're time or money. I think it's good to watch a few episodes before purchase but if you've seen some and liked it and just wanna buy this and marathon then I say go for it. The plot get's more and more interesting as you go and all the characters are fun to watch develop.  As for this product itself I'd assume it's quite good as I have the GX, 5Ds, and Yugioh, seasons and the disk and box quality and such was all good. I've also seen this particular series in both Japanese and English and I think the Dub is very well done. There's a edit or two here and there but overall it stays true to the original and gives off the same mood, allt he actors are top notch and fit the characters well.",1426291200,,922,4.093922651933702
6447338,1,B00KTZAJYI,"This Yugioh series wasn't really that great.  I saw every episode just so i could say i saw every episode, it was the worst yugioh series out of them all.  While im sure the dvd will be good quality and work perfectly this series is just not worth spending money on.",1426204800,2,266,4.196078431372549
6447339,4,B00KTZAJYI,"Cinedigm have seen sense and have put Zexal on the same format as all their other Yu Gi Oh releases, that is, issuing them in complete sets. My heart sank when I saw Zexal initially released as ""season One, Volume One"", as it would have been different to everything else.

Thankfully Cinedigm have realised that these sets are largely selling to collectors - who will be buying all of them. And what collectors want are collections, that is, not only each series forming a collection, but also, an overarching collection of all of the series. Collectors want something that looks good on the shelf, and nothing spoils the look of a collection than something out of place.

It made no sense to release the original series, GX and 5DS as season boxsets but Zexal in part-season volumes. That has now been corrected.

The only thing left is to find out whether we'll be getting the episodes that have no English dub (they could do a dub for the DVD release, or simply subtitles, likely cheaper) and also, whether Arc-V is included in the deal.

It's a shame that they elected to use the Anglicised episodes.; original Japanese with subs would have been better. That would have had 5 stars.

I also suspect we will be seeing complete boxsets of 5Ds, GX and Zexal, as with the original.",1425859200,4,1281,4.6255506607929515

8661553,1,B00KTZAJYI,if you want to buy yugioh zexal on DVD I would recommend getting the complete first season that's available now since it looks like they won't be releasing yugioh zexal on individual volumes,1431907200,,190,4.787878787878788
8661554,5,B00KTZAJYI,"I like this season a lot, it was fun to watch the first season of Yugioh Zexal again, considering it hasn't been on the CW for Kids for a while. On the back of the box it says that it is approximately 17 hours, however I timed each of the 6 discs & they were each about 3 hours, which would make this approximately 18 hours long instead. In this season it doesn't get to the finals of the World Duel Carnival, it's mainly focusing on the preliminary rounds at the end of the season, with Yuma winning the last piece he needs to enter the finals from Trey.",1431388800,,555,4.10091743119266
8661555,4,B00KTZAJYI,I think Zexal is a good series as a whole. The only thing that was disappointing to me at times were the various duels. Every duelist played there strongest XYZ's monsters almost right away so there wasn't those moment's like in the previous series where you could see the variety in the various characters decks and how they would you their cards. The first season and a half (Duel Carnival) are the best part of Zexal to me. So I'll happily buy the first two box sets and contemplate whether to get the third.,1431043200,,511,4.446808510638298
