7822192,3,6302136202,"OK, I'm a big Lenny Henry mark, but, I was a little disappointed by this tape. I remember seeing the show when it was broadcast and it seems that they left out a lot of really funny things. It is a tragedy that soul  singer Theopolus P. Wildebeast shows up for only 30 seconds. Still, no one  is better at send ups of both Michael Jackson and Prince and the ongoing  episode of ""The Jewel in the Passage of India"" is pretty funny  stuff. Lenny stand up is a little dated now, however.",947635200,,484,4.172043010752688
