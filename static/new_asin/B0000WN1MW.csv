1957907,5,B0000WN1MW,"Marci-X is one of those movies so bad they are good. The movie seems to try and run every rom-com cliche into the ground, kick it a few times then do it all over again.

1957908,5,B0000WN1MW,"....all at the same time. Can't really understand all of the negative reviews but of course, to each his own. This movie pokes fun at many aspects of American culture successfully I think. Yes, it's over the top, but in a great way. Laughter does the heart good!",1356825600,,262,4.479166666666667
1957909,1,B0000WN1MW,"This could be one of the worst movies I ever purchased.  I have an extensive collection of movies, but would not enter this into my collection. (I donated it to the local library book store - some other pour soul will probably only have to spend a dollar or two for it, then burn it.)",1304899200,,284,4.163636363636364
1957910,1,B0000WN1MW,"It's been a long time since I rated any title 1 star.  A 1-star movie has to be truly beyond saving, having a cast of unbearable characters, a story that's either dated or rehashed without any attempt of keeping it fresh, one that is unintentionally painful to watch from beginning to end.  I reward such a undetectable accolade to ""Marci X"", a film with two actors that are way passed their prime during its release.

Congratulations, ""Marci X"".  You knew how to make a 2003 movie feel like a 1990 movie, with Caucasian rich people trying to be real by using ebonics and embarrassing me with their unfunny and insulting acts of reaching out to the minority; a scene in which rich white gals doing an African ritual dance in an urban club and everyone believing they're the bee's knees is nothing short of painful.  But nothing is painful like Marci Feld (Kudrow), trying to reach out to the controversial rap artist named Dr. S (Wayans) by singing horrifyingly bad rap songs; it's baffling that one song is about being rich and white, and somehow the black ladies, a drag queen, and a gospel group find this to be remarkable.  She makes Vanilla Ice look like Scarface and yet her songs are better than the songs Dr. S spit out, which are the lowest form of rap there is.  He said he's keeping it real, but he's acting more like an immature child who's being controversial for the sake of attention.  There's a different between controversy for the sake of making a point and controversy for the sake of controversy, and nothing about this character reflects maturity to even defend the latter.  Even if the purpose was satire, the effort was weak and Wayans oversimplified his performance.

Nothing about this film is in touch with reality.  Why would a Tipper Gore-esque character named Mary Spinkle blame a company for something the rapper is responsible for instead of the rapper himself?  You don't see people blame Universal Media Group for all the mess Eminem himself spoke.  What's the point in the laziest joke of the film where a charity is about kids who can't move or feel their arms even though they have them?  People who can't feel their arms can still move them and if the arms are immobile, why weren't they amputated?  Must the movie really need a blatant gay joke towards a ridiculously-flamboyant boy band?  Every aspect of the story felt like it was written by a snotty adolescent with no history of literature.

""Marci X"" hurts me.  It really hurts me; it's asinine in a gaudy display.  The director is out-of-touch with the contemporary world and it showed.  There's NOTHING in this movie to reach out to anyone, and it's an insult to people regardless of color and class as well as the rational mind.  It's a film not many have heard of, and that's for the best.",1275868800,,2786,4.633401221995927
1957911,1,B0000WN1MW,"If the popular media does not offer enough homophobia, anti-semitism, gender stereotypes, and racial self-hatred, this is the film for you!  It offers all in abundant supply with added bonus of 20% more cliches than other movies.  There's the added advantage that every joke fails.  How many films can boast that.

There are a number of 1 cent used copies listed here.  You may want to wait for them to come down a bit more, so you don't feel robbed of your money and your time.",1212364800,2,478,4.511627906976744
1957912,4,B0000WN1MW,"This movie has gotten far too many negative reviews. Yes, this movie is dumb. But anyone who cares to take a second look can see that it was well thought out. The satire is great and timely. If you are not too proud or high minded to enjoy lowbrow comedy then you should give this movie a chance. Too many critics love to tear a movie apart because it does not suite their personal tastes, and they go out of their way to make everyone else hate it as well. This is too bad, and such people shouldn't write reviews at all, in my opinion. Good movie critics need to give people a chance to decide for themselves what they sould like or dislike. Just because you are a movie critic doesn't mean your tastes are better than anyone else's.",1200614400,8,735,4.257142857142857
1957913,4,B0000WN1MW,"The problem with Marci X is in this era of ideological constraint identification of an audience base was an impossibility. However, if you liked Bamboozled, this satirical film lampooning the exploitive cultures of Rap Music and Corporate America while managing to lob a grenade or two at the uninformed arrogance of conspicuously consuming socialites will entertain you as well.

Lisa Kudrow is the over the top incarnation of the Upper East Side conveniently relevant Jewish socialite and Damon Wayans succeeds admirably as the up from the ghetto hip-hop icon. The unification of the two, if you watch the film, is not as implausible as some might think because while their nurturing  may have been diametrically opposite, by the time they meet the they have each become less than commendable representations of all that is wrong with inculcation of economic excess.

Richard Benjamin is the symbol of corporate management, where the only truly operative consideration is enhancement of the bottom line until orchestrated public outcry, in this instance lead by a self-aggrandizing Senator portrayed Christine Baranaski who naturally has her own private agenda, places superficial attention to social responsibility on the cusp.  Throw in some gems offered by Kudrow's sidekicks, most notably , Jane Krakowski, add a  J.Lo wannabe, and an assortment of caricatures  from both sides of the economic divide  and you have about ninety minutes of fun.",1195257600,3,1449,5.328947368421052
1957914,3,B0000WN1MW,"That's what this movie was, and it was entirely underrated. I hope that society will resurrect it sometime in the near future and revere it for the so-bad-it's-good movie that it is. Yes, as far as social commentary goes, the movie could have gone further. But unlike a lot of other movies out there that are just plain terrible, this one has the admirable quality of missing the mark but actually still being entertaining and, dare I say it, classic in its own right.",1156636800,,468,4.583333333333333
1957915,5,B0000WN1MW,this movie is just so out there you can't help but love it...  all the variety of the people just add to the laughs... you get both silly humor and the stuff you have to think about...,1156291200,,184,3.972972972972973
1957916,1,B0000WN1MW,I finally had a slow night so I figured I'd watch this movie for a cheap laugh&that was it. Damon Waynes Role was like a Metro Sexual version of Snoop Dogg. putting that concept together alone will have you rolling. Lisa Kudrow plays a snow Bunny Princess trying to curb Waynes presentation asa Rapper. Kudrow&Her Posse come across like a Clearence Sale version of the Chicks from Sexy in the City meets Desperate Housewive. the Boy Band Spoof was funny.but this film stanked.,1138233600,,476,4.746987951807229
1957917,4,B0000WN1MW,"I would consider myself a real critic. I can find something wrong with almost anything. Saying that, I thought as a satire kind of film, this is damn near brilliant and very humorous. A very nice expose of silly American taboos. Lisa Kudrow and Damon Wayans have great on screen chemistry. The people saying this film is so bad most certainly take things a little too seriously.",1135641600,6,378,4.656716417910448
1957918,5,B0000WN1MW,"This movie is getting a very hard time.  It does not deserve it, I won't write another plot synopsis, but I will say it takes so many social stereotypes and pokes fun at all of them.  I was not expecting to like this movie and had never even heard of it, it simply came on TV one night- but I have subsequently made all my friends watch and they enjoyed it to.

Wayans is great as a hardcore rapper, and Kudrow is convincing as a deb who just wants to help the homeless get food, clothes, and conditioner.  In fact her friends are the same way, one helps inner city youths dress in the correct size.

This movie plays on typical stereotypes and play with political correctness and does so in a charming way, b/c you really like the characters.",1131840000,6,743,4.2785714285714285
1957919,1,B0000WN1MW,"Well, I heard this film was bad, very bad.  So I just got curious, you know, wanted to check out how bad this film could be, fearfully and tremblingly.  Now I see.  'Marci X' is really bad, so bad that I stopped worrying about wasting my time, and started to enjoy the film's badness.

So, it's about Marci our heroine played by Lisa Kudrow.  Marci is a rich daughter to a big company's president, and being a solialite too, can think and act like princess.  But her dad is now in trouble, for one rapper named Dr. S (played by Damon Wayans ... oh no) released a 'controversial' album, which provoked a national furor.

Now, here's a question.  Do you believe in this story?  If yes, how about this?  Marci, determined to help her daddy out alone, walks right up to the rapper himself, and walks onto the stage with him too holding a handbag, sings a rap song (parody song) about desinger's clothes, and wins over the hissing audience to her side.  And it's done ab lib!  It's a comedy, I know, but being comedy is no excuse for being way too incredible.

The film is full of stereotyped characters.  All the gags, or the values they parody, are awfully dated (these days real record companies know what they are doing, not foolish enough to grab the chance to cash in on the 'notorious' artist,) Plus, black people are either rappers (and fans of rappers) or in jail; a Latino girl is hot-tempered; and when a ultra-conservative senator appears, she (yes, she!) is a white played by Christine Balanski, who condemns the rap music as devil's music.  As if we are living in the time of Elvis.

And that senator suddenly (and predictably) starts to dance to a rap number when she is left alone at home.  Of course, the music is irresistible, but we have seen a similar scene in 'In & Out,' haven't we?  Actuallt Paul Rudnick wrote the script of both 'In & Out' and 'Marci X.'  The difference is, Kevin Kline was fun to see; however, she is just painfully unfunny.

One last incredible thing; 'Marci X' was produced by Paramount Pictures, and mercifully ignored by most audiences who just didn't notice its theatrical release in America.  But what I cannot understand is that while making this messy comedy, Paramount virtually killed its popular 'Star Trek' franchise with not-so-good 'Nemesis' so mercilessly.  But why?",1112745600,5,2318,4.616136919315403
1957920,1,B0000WN1MW,"I thought this was gonna be a really funny, really good movie...but it just wasn't. Damon Wayans totally missed the mark and Lisa Kudrow just wasn't able to make it laugh. This movie you could easily skip...it's a stupid story about trying to get (an untalented) rapper to change who he is and show that he's not a threat to the kids, and Kudrow, who plays the daughter of the rich man who owns the record label that Wayans's character is associated with, just doesn't really deliver the kind of performance I thought she would. Basically this movie is something you can skip. Stupid storyline, dumb character, and not-so-good acting..
I don't know about Damon Wayans but I do love Lisa Kudrow. If you want a great, funny performance by Kudrow, check out the movie ""Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion"", it's way better than this movie.",1088208000,5,840,4.72108843537415
1957921,2,B0000WN1MW,"I was really disapointed with this movie, it had some funny moments but not enough.  The cast of this movie is far too talented to have participated in this project, I feel bad for them.  I had to stop this movie after trying really hard to stick with it, but as soon as my gitlfriend fell asleep I lost my final bit of motivation to keep watching.",1078790400,,348,4.17910447761194
1957922,4,B0000WN1MW,"Despite reviews that could be described lukewarm at best, I still saw this movie as a fan of Lisa Kudrow.  I never expected to find a movie that was actually funny, with a fairly sharp satirical edge.
The movie as a whole was kind of stupid (in a good way).  And if you watch this movie with lowered expectations you will enjoy this fairly diverting comedy.",1077321600,8,357,4.393939393939394
1957923,1,B0000WN1MW,"to all of you who rates this movie above a 2: apparently you havnt noticed that the film industry is saturated by black-meets-white ""comedies"" that are only made to make money from ignorant suckers. this movie is not funny, so don't watch it. attention film industry: STOP SELLING OUT",1076976000,2,284,4.816326530612245
1957924,3,B0000WN1MW,"When talking about this movie the first word that comes to mind is ""flop."" And flop it did. Not even the famous faces of Lisa Kudrow and Damon Waynes could save the box office effect of Marci X. After being shelved for a little over a year, director and actor Richard Benjamin decided to bring the movie out this summer. There was no advance screenings and there was hardly any promotion for it. It made a quiet entrance and is making an even quieter exit. In openign weekend it failed to make more then 900,000 dollars. But I saw it. And needless to say, there were flaws. But it was funny. Parts of this movie were just so stupid that they made me laugh untill I was red in the face. When I went into the theatre I counted the amount of people that showed up for the evening show. There were about six, not including me and my mother, who saw the film with me and surprisly didn't fall asleep.
The movie stars Lisa Kudrow as Marci Feld. She's rich, and doesn't have a job. She does however like to hang out with fellow rich friends Caitilen, Lauren, and Kristin. But during a social get together, her father Ben Feld(director Richard Benjamin) is interrupted because of a news report concerning him. Feld's empire holds Felony Assault, a record label, run by Tubby Fenders, who is in jail. Fenders artist Dr. S(Damon Waynes)has made a controversal album(song titles include Shoot the Teacher, and The Power in my Pants) Senator Mary Ann Spinkler(Vote for Spinker)decided to gather a group of people to boycott everything run by the man who controls Dr. S....Marci's father. This causes Ben to have a heart attack in the effect of this. She also holds a hearing about the matter.
Ben is held in isolation so nothing in the media about him could cause him to get furthur heath problems. Marci decides to prepare for the hearing and try to get Dr. S to change his public image, while alone the way falling for Dr. S, angering his girlfriend Yolanda. From there Marci and Dr. S began the showdown with Spinkler, to try and save her father's company.
I didn't have a problem with this movie. I thought it was funny and it offered an escape for an hour and a half. It's not a movie to really judge on it's artistic format, but to go out and have a good time with it. There are too many people that think it has to be serious to be a good movie. It's a matinee movie, heck mabey even a movie to pay full admission for. It's not as good as other summer comedies like My Boss's Daughter, but you leave the theatre feeling satisfied. So see a movie without all of the big Hollywood effects, or the great dazzling reviews, and go just expecting to have a good time. Lisa Kudrow and Damon Waybes(with his light voice) go perfectly together. I don't expect a sequal, I don't want a sequal, but seeing this movie was just fine.
ENJOY!
Rated R for language and sexual content.",1062028800,4,2863,4.424242424242424
