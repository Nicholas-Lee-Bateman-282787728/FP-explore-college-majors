8598448,5,B00DVUGQ0O,"Although reruns are now available on ""The Filipino Channel"", it still makes purchasing the DVD an enjoyable investment.  This Volume did become available during the celebration of the one year anniversary of the series and the announcement of a movie being made.  The vendor continue to provide good service in making it available to the buyers and the speed of delivery is as expected.  Thank you.

This Volume has the prom episodes.  We totally enjoyed watching it again.",1374105600,,473,5.012820512820513
