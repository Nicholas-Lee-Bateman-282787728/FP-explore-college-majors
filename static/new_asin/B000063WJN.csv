8173246,5,B000063WJN,"Although the DVD I watched was in German without English sub-titles, the narrative was easy to follow. The songs were pleasant, and the comedic skills of the cast[especially Martha Eggerth and Alfred Abel] very entertaining. The visual style of Sirk's direction is enhanced by brilliant camera work. Hopefully ZU NEUEN UFERN will return to DVD distribution, as well others of his early films.
