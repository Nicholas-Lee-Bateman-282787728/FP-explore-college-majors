8109167,3,B000EGDBW4,"The strength of this video is that it shows dozens of paintings  familiar and less well-known -- by Mary Cassatt in good color.  Theres informative commentary on the artist and the phases of her career, preferred subjects, composition, use of backgrounds to create effects, brush techniques, and influences  Correggio, Spain, Japanese prints, Edgar Degas, and the impressionists among them.

The weakness of the video is the same as its strength.  The spoken narrative runs while paintings show on the screen, sometimes without coordination.  While the narrative includes information about her life, there are no photographs of the artist, her studios, her family, or the artists with whom she associated.  The details of her paintings, mentioned in the narrative, are not really pointed out.  The video will appeal to individuals with some background in art, but those looking for a fuller portrait of the artist and her times probably need to look elsewhere.
