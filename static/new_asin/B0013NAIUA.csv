8252407,5,B0013NAIUA,"Season 3 was the point where The Two Ronnies really pulled it all together and came up with a great season. More skits and great material. The ""How To"" skits were cleverly done and I really enjoyed the parodies of popular shows, especially the Colditz and Star Trek parodies.",1430265600,,275,4.63265306122449
8252408,5,B0013NAIUA,"Series Three of the Two Ronnies offers evem more wit and wisdom from the two blokes.  Barker and Corbett continue to please and the laughs follow.  Barker's ability to put on a costume and make you believe in his character is testament to his craft and comedy.  Corbett's ability to play off Barker will have you doubled over in laughter if British comedy is your proverbial cup of tea.

Remember, if you do not have a DVD player and television capable of playing multiregion broadcasts, this is NOT for you.  This is for UK and mainland Europe.",1423872000,,545,4.577319587628866
