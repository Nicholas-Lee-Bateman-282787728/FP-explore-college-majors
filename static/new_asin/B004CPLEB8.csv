8423336,5,B004CPLEB8,"I cannot really stomach 12 tone music or Eurotrash productions.  However, there are two operas by Aribert Reimann in my DVD collection.  Spectacular productions and a dramatic idiom firmly anchored in 12 tone and corresponding perfectly to the ferocity of the primal passions contained in each work.  Medea, as we all know,  was a role owned by Maria Callas both as a singer and as an actress. For this particular version, though, one needs Marlis Petersen [soprano, Germany], whose stunning vocal technique and acting chops carry the piece from beginning to end. Michela Selinger [mezzo, Austria] as Creusa and Elizabeth Kulman [mezzo/contralto, Austria] as Gora, Medeas companion, complete the female trio of principals.  The males also conform a triad: Michael Rolder [tenor, Austria] as Creon; a stunning Adrian Erd, [baritone, Hungary]  as Jason; and Max Emanuel Cendic, [countertenor, Serbia], making his debut in the house,  all equally excellent vocally and dramatically. Michael Boder conducts the Vienna State Opera Orchestra. The superb production was directed by Marco Arturo Marelli.",1474416000,,1096,5.488095238095238
8423337,5,B004CPLEB8,"I am very impressed with this new opera. You soon get used to the music and it is very appropriate for the story which is not based on Euripides' Medea but on a libretto called ""The Golden Fleece"" by Grillparzer.  Nevertheless, it shares the essential elements of Euripides.  This opera is riveting in every way, giving the singers an opportunity to show all their feelings which they skillfully do.  Even the set, though sparse, is interesting.  Part of it features a rocky hillside which, as things get more ""rocky"" in the story, begins to avalanche slowly.  The sound of the rocks falling becomes part of the music.  It is an extremely intense experience and never boring.  Marlis Petersen is a beautiful and sympathetic Medea singing what eventually feels like strangely beautiful music. I'm very happy to own this DVD.",1408060800,4,823,4.877697841726619
8423338,5,B004CPLEB8,"First seeing this work on DVD in a retail shop in 2011, I was impressed by the production but found the music very difficult to listen to.
As a world premiere, recorded in 2010 at the Vienna Staatsoper, you can be sure that since the composer took an active part in its production, writing the libretto himself, choosing the cast and writing specifically for their voices (as opera would have been traditionally done in the past), this version of Medea is, for better or worse, as close as it is possible to be to Aribert Reimanns intentions.
But since Medea is a familiar figure in the opera world with Cherubinis version of the Greek tragedy famously interpreted by the late Maria Callas, I acquired the DVD eventually.
Musically this new German impressionist piece contains little tune for the singers, who pays particular keen attention to the direction at the pit.  In comparison with Reimanns earlier operas, the musical textures are pared down: jaggedly expressive vocal lines are underpinned with just a single instrument or a veil of strings. Yet the sense of dramatic pacing is so acute that the lack of weight is never noticed; and even if it's not always clear what Reimann's music is adding, the mix is powerfully effective and conveys a real sense of its theatrical impact.
It is therefore the voices that are the most expressive of the dilemma of the characters.  The singings of the various characters are untuneful, but they expresses the inner psychology of the characters. Medeas is a series of high, hysterical and strained notes of anger, betrayal and despair and comes close to screaming most of the time.  An intense retelling of the ancient Greek myth, Reimanns Medea expresses everything the story ought to and as forcefully as it ought to be.
As for the plot, the story of Medea has inspired artists for centuries. The psychological tension in this tale of love, betrayal, rejection and murder, including infanticide, has made it ideal for operatic treatment, whether following Euripides or, as here, the 19th-century play by Grillparzer. This expressionist opera in four pictures was commissioned by the Vienna State Opera. The singers are also hand-picked by the composer.
Dramatically, this is a taut, gripping work, sympathetic of Medeas suffering and isolation as she loses gradually all she loves, including her children, and takes revenge. If this all seems rather bleak, there are still beauty and lyricism within the tension and turbulence of Reimanns inventive score. The playful scene between Medea and Kreusa at the start of the second picture is an enchanting study of an outsiders futile attempt to fit in.
Among the strong cast, the photogenic and handsome Marlis Petersen is outstanding in the demanding title role, more than ably supported by Adrian Erds uneasy and sometimes debonair Jason.  Mezzo-soprano Michaela Selinger is an attractive and naive Kreusa.  Elisabeth Kulman has much stage presence in a tribal costume while Michael Roder is an elegant and regal King Creon.  The elfin-faced countertenor Max Emanuel Cencic is visually as well as vocally striking as the Herald.
The two hours watching easily flew by despite the often discordant sounds.",1405987200,4,3199,5.060721062618596
8423339,5,B004CPLEB8,"This DVD gives us the Viennese production of the opera which was done in collaboration with Frankfurt am Main. So we can consider it is representative of the first production.

The setting is at once visually striking. The space supposedly in front of Kreon's palace and under the walls of the city of Corinth is a wasteland. Only rocks and no vegetation of any sort. The palace itself is a glass box high up over this wasteland with a collapsible staircase for Kreon and Kreusa to come down, but the floor of that box can come down for the second act that takes place in the palace. This contrast of shape and general outlook of the two locales plus the use of the lighting to makes the wasteland natural with day and night and the palace artificial with constant artificial light is very effective, and the final transformation of the wasteland into the exile land of both Medea and Jason is a perfect continuation.

The stage director and costume designer decided to entirely project the opposition of red and white in the text onto the costumes. Medea and the children are dressed in red at the beginning, and Gora the Colchian slave in some kind of purple. The Corinthians are in white. Jason who is dressed in some kaki color at the beginning, him being a soldier, dresses in white when he is accepted by Kreon. Later the children will be dressed in white after having been accepted in Corinth. The final dressing changes are also striking since Medea will be dressed in the Golden Fleece, over her red dress, and Jason will just be huddled up on the stage against a rock  wrapped up in rags supposedly deprived of clothing of any sort.

This systematic use of contrasts gives to Jason's declaration ""Sei eine Griechin"" a very powerful meaning. The opera is thus visually centered on the opposition between Greeks and Barbarians, Greeks and foreigners, Greeks and exiles. Grillparzer's play certainly went that way, the libretto by Reimann certainly goes that way, but the visual realization of that divide and opposition makes it a lot more powerful than anything else and we are definitely convinced then that we are dealing with a political problem and not with a simple crime, the murder of two children by their mother.

Jason is shown all along as an obnoxious man who took Medea for sexual satisfaction and nothing else. His real love was Kreusa and both elements show as soon as Jason comes on stage and rejects Medea in all possible ways, gestures, attitudes, tone, language, and of course dressing code. It shows when Kreusa appears and especially when Kreusa tries to teach Medea a Greek song and then Jason comes and he is at least gross and cruel even when Kreusa tries to make him behave more humanely. He has rejected Medea completely for reasons that have to do with her ethnic origin more than anything else. His love declaration at the end appears as a cynical way to get some kind of death comrade, a companion to die with.

The Herald scene is phenomenal. The choice of a countertenor is a very good idea, but the way he is dressed in a silver long coat and his attendants in dark grey long coats make him and them stand out as some kind of angels or messengers of the gods, as he says he is. But also as these justice bounty hunters who used to wear such dusters when running after criminals. His attitude is very authoritative with everyone even Kreon. He is dominant and his game of planting seven spears in the ground both on Medea's side and on Jason's side is very effective to show how he does not make any difference between the two, and it is only Kreon who will take the spears on Jason's side to add them on Medea's side. Seven spears, a number from the gods. But later in that scene, when Jason and Kreon go away, Medea's declaration ""Gebt Raum!"" becomes counter-referential because both Kreon and Jason are already gone. This order given to them to go away is vain and powerless, as she is since she buried her magic at the beginning of the opera.

This type of confrontational acting gives to Medea's declaration ""Du nahmst mich, wie ich war, behalt mich, wie ich bin"" an accusatory dimension that it does not really carry in the words, and the music amplifies this feeling. We feel Medea thinks Jason is not able to take her the way she is in spite of all. Even at the end he does not want her the way she is because if he did he would go to Delphi himself to confront the Amphictyons.

And in that perspective of a reinterpretation of the myth, the short sentence, probably in the judicial meaning, by Medea ""Ganz sei es vollbracht"" is an echo of our culture: ""Es ist vollbracht"" in Saint John's Passion by J.S. Bach, quoted from the Bible itself and the meaning it has when it is pronounced by Jesus on the cross is transported in the context of this opera and Medea is literally transformed if not transmuted from an infanticide to the simple tool of the gods against the sectarian rejection of anyone just because this one is different. Of course to have that meaning the libretto has taken some liberty with the myth about the killing of Pelias which is more or less made accidental, whereas in the myth it is definitely purposeful, though indirectly, from Medea. We will note too that the killing of Medea's brother is also more or less pushed aside.

The music helps us in that direction. That systematic suspended singing with vocalises that end up in thin air over and over again keeping our ears in suspension is very effective to keep our attention in suspension too. Never can we just let ourselves go into some kind of easygoing enjoyment. Always are we kept alert and awake as for the motivations and the meanings of actions and characters. What's more, the use of instruments to create an atmosphere here and there, somber, dark rarely luminous though at times sleek and sneaky when Medea is trying to get her ends with some linguistic magic, is also very systematic: no attempt at getting nice musical effects, but always the aim of getting our attention in full alarm. Percussions are particularly important for bleak and tense moments. Even in these moments when the music is so perfectly adapted to its aim we cannot let go because that perfect music is telling us to wake up and watch out and drop all pre-constructed ideas if not pre-conceived prejudices.

8423340,4,B004CPLEB8,"A very interesting example o modern music. But as is the rule today badly staged and direct. I hope we shall have in DVD soon LEAR, perhaps the best oper of Reimann.",1312934400,2,165,4.1875
8423341,4,B004CPLEB8,"With very little to compare it to, the best way I can think of to describe Aribert Reimann's Medea is that it can be very difficult to listen to.  But, with it being a modern opera, you probably could have guessed as much anyway.  As a world premiere, recorded in 2010 at the Vienna Staatsoper, it's not even as if you can measure or contrast the performance against other recordings.  What you can be sure of however, since the composer is still alive and taking an active part in its production - even down to writing the libretto himself, choosing the cast and writing specifically for their voices (as opera would have been traditionally done in the past) - is that this version of Medea is, for better or worse, as close as it is possible to be to Reimann's intentions.

Whether it's difficult or not is not what matters then, whether it's not the most harmonious or beautiful sounds you've ever heard in an opera, nor whether it's completely faithful to the composer's intentions (though it is undoubtedly is all of the above), as much as whether it works as an opera on its own terms, that its story or message connects with the listener on some level and that its presentation is suited to the content.  Medea is a familiar figure in the opera world - Cherubini's version of the Greek tragedy and Maria Callas' interpretation of it are almost legendary - a formidable female role on a par with Salome and Electra, and perhaps in that respect the name of Strauss can be invoked in the intensity and psychological acuity with which Reimann scores his version of the Medea legend.

The source is classical, of course, but Reimann draws from other sources than Euripides, bringing in the legend of the Golden Fleece and the Argonauts from Franz Grillparzer's version of the stories.  Reimann is known for his literary adaptations (particularly for his version of Lear), but as to what purpose or intent a modern opera looks back at classical subjects is difficult to say.  Surprisingly, the composer seems to view Medea's dilemma as being one of class anxiety and social climbing, both on her part from her background of Colchis - she is seen by herself and others as a barbarian - and on the part of Jason who, after suspicion has fallen on them for the death of Pelias, has fled Jolkos and sought sanctuary from King Creon, abandoning Medea in the process for the sophisticated life of Corinth and the hand of his rather more beautiful daughter Creusa.

Relating this conflict between old world and the new, between past and present - the set contrasting the bleak lunar landscape inhabited by Medea with the almost space-age nature of Corinth - the orchestration is accordingly made up of slow, discordant notes that are stretched and bent, a strangled string section, with woodwind trills, flatulent brass and deep percussive, almost industrial sounds.  But it's the voices that are the most expressive of the dilemma of the characters - high, emotional, intentionally strained, notes of anger, betrayal and despair that come close to a scream, yet - particularly in the case of Marlis Petersen as Medea - always remaining tuneful and musical.  Medea consequently is not for those seeking beautiful melodies or harmonies, but rather a deeper expression of darker natures, uncomfortable alliances and fractured relationships in an intense retelling of the ancient Greek myth.  On that level, Reimann's Medea expresses everything the story ought to and as forcefully as it ought to be.

On Blu-ray, the opera looks and sounds magnificent (or indeed terrifying and deeply unsettling).  The High Definition image is superbly clear, with strong contrasts and deep, well-defined colours.  Both the PCM Stereo and the DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 tracks carry the full force of the music, the surround mix in particular deep and reverberating on the lower frequencies.  Other than some notes on the composition and its performance in an accompanying booklet, there are no extra features on the Arthaus disc.",1298505600,13,4003,4.89069423929099
