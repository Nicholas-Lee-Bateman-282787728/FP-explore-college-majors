8072417,3,B000A1KY6Y,This film is just as good as when I first saw it over 30 years ago. A shame they have cropped the image to fit a wide screen tv. Often the tops of heads are missing. This is a very frustrating practice.,1485820800,,202,3.8333333333333335
8072418,5,B000A1KY6Y,When my brother was little he loved to watch this movie. I gave it to him on his 33rd birthday and he said his collection is now complete.,1461628800,,138,3.9642857142857144
8072419,3,B000A1KY6Y,"Bought this for my wife because she remembered it being very entertaining many years ago when she saw it on TV. I guess things change. We found it boring, far too psychedelic, and it was nothing like my wife remembered. The story is cool and maybe kids will get the point, but one could go blind trying to absorb all of the weird and bizarre colors and drawings.",1458000000,,362,4.338235294117647
8072420,4,B000A1KY6Y,"This is a review of the Warner Archive DVD released in 2015. Hugo the Hippo is one of those films that had all of the makings of a hit, but sadly failed to find an audience on its release to theaters and has languished in obscurity ever since. The animation design is in a style reminiscent of the work of Peter Max or Heinz Edelmann, the primary designer of Yellow Submarine. It consists of bold, flat colors with thick, black outlines. Think of it like a stained glass window. Movement can be limited, however this is in service to the graphic layout, rather than an obvious cost-cutting measure. It's a very striking film. The voice work by veteran actors Robert Morley and Paul Lynde leads real humor to their respective characters. The songs in the film have very catchy tunes, however the lyrics are hit-and-miss. The opening song, especially, contains lyrics that reach for depth and, instead, find daftness. Many of the songs were sung by the ubiquitous Seventies stars Marie and Jimmy Osmond. It really should have worked and much of it does. Where it falls down is in keeping the plot moving. So much time and effort is expended on the visual aspect of the film that the plot can tend to meander. I can imagine children becoming rather fidgety during a viewing and, as that is the target audience, the film fails on that level. HOWEVER, to older children and adult fans of animation, the film is an absolute treat. So few films were able to capture psychedelic art and place it in motion in an aesthetically-pleasing and coherent manner. Hugo the Hippo absolutely should be appreciated for the skill and effort that went into it. It's a smart film. It's a beautiful film. It's the kind of film to pop when you are in the frame of mind to open your senses and let them be overwhelmed. If you've seen it, you know what I mean. If you haven't, you absolutely should.

Now to the technical aspects of the DVD. Prior to this release, the film has only been available briefly on VHS and via a homemade DVD from the director's personal copy. The Warner Archive DVD is a marked improvement on both of those releases. The image is stable and there is detail visible that wasn't present on VHS or the homemade DVD. The image is presented in approximate a matted 1.85:1 ratio. As the previous release was full-frame and showed more image information, I questioned whether or not the matted AR was correct. While filming in Academy Ratio and matting for widescreen in the theaters was common practice in the past, it is rare to see it done for animation. I was able to track down Bill Feigenbaum, the director, and ask him which aspect ratio was correct. He confirmed that the film was animated and shot at 1.37:1 but with an intended theatrical ratio of 1.85.1. The DVD is correct. The film element utilized is sadly far-from-pristine. It is obvious from the amount of dirt on the print and a distinct softness throughout the film that a print was used, rather than the original negative. There are also some compression artifacts visible throughout the running time. Honestly, though, it was a big surprise that Warner even released the film so beggars can't be choosers. The sound is Dolby Digital 2.0 mono. It's perfectly serviceable, but rather flat and tinny.

Overall, I would absolutely recommend Hugo the Hippo for fans of animation and those who grew up in the 1970s. It's a wonderful artifact of the time at which it was produced and a real visual treat.",1444435200,5,3463,4.64763458401305

8072424,5,B000A1KY6Y,"a fine addition to your animated collection this movie was made in 1975 by hungarian producers! A story of the ruler getting hippos to rid zanzybarr of its shark problem. The hippos do and are worhsiped and given lots of lovely food. However the people take them for granted and soon they starve. The hippos start to raid the farms and the farmers complain to the evil adviser who kills them! Hugo the hero of the story is orphaned and depends on the love of the local school children to help him.

A rare piece of art that will bring tears to the viewer. I saw this  when I was 5 years old and I treasure it!",1123372800,6,609,4.196581196581197
