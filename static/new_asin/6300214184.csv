247850,3,6300214184,"Some of the dance scenes are great to watch, but the story doesn't age well at all.  I guess in the 80s, it was entertaining to watch an independent young woman fall in love with her creepy boss who keeps asking her out over and over, even though she has repeatedly said ""no.""

247856,1,6300214184,"Uggghhhhhhhhhh .... so bad! I was a kid in the 80's and never got to watch this movie until now. It is so bad. Plot is non-existent. All it is is sexual innuendo, sex and bad dancing. Seriously, the best dancing of the whole movie was in the intro scene, the rest is just jerky, flailing around and falling on the ground. I guess they were trying to be cool. Didn't work.  No rhythm, no tempo, didn't even look nice. Just sex, bad dancing, sex, bad dancing .... ad nauseam. About 3/4 the way through I saw a glimmer of a piece of some kind of storyline - she wanted to get into dance school. But she is so immature and annoying ... I can't take it. No character depth at all. The protagonist is annoying and unlikable.  I stopped watching with about 15 minutes left of the movie because I just couldn't watch it anymore. Wow. Just so bad. I should have watched Avengers.",1500336000,2,870,4.266666666666667

watch this movie for it's what the 80's were all about; the good, the bad and the mighty big hair. The music is good.
The dancing is too. I admit that at times I had a goofy grin on my face. Just enjoy it for what it is...",1500249600,2,414,3.7045454545454546

248005,4,6300214184,"A classic 80s movie about chasing your dreams and never giving up.  Jennifer Beals plays a young Pittsburgh woman, who works as a welder by day and exotic dancer by night, who is trying to get admitted into a dance school despite having no formal dance training.  The plot is rather predictable, but it is a good story.  The movie features several iconic scenes as well as famous dance songs.",1488758400,,392,4.571428571428571

248160,3,6300214184,"This movie has been summarized pretty well by others here, but I tend to agree with the general aggregate on the Internet. A 60% ranking overall seems like the right score for this thing.

So, let's start with Jennifer Beals' performance here. I actually think it was good. Not great, just good. It was her first role, and you can see that she was actually trying here. So sure, she wasn't a great actress in this first role - not even very good. Just slightly above mediocre. Jennifer is getting by on pure charisma and good looks for a nice chunk of this movie. Not ideal, but it works here. She actually has a lot of raw talent on display too. She just needed more polish, more work put in.

The story is all over the place. This thing is cut like a bunch of montages spliced together by newbie college students.  The story hardly builds on any of its payoffs; so this comes off cheap to most viewers. Her old protege guardian/teacher is simply there. A crappy bar patron gives a straight-faced waitress a big tip after being a giant blowhard like usual; later in the movie the jerk and straight-laced waitress are an item - maybe she got him to stop being such a slimeball when she apparently started dating this wannabe mobster dude? We don't know - stuff just happens. How about Alex's BFF buildup to an ice-skater? Looks promising for 3/4 of the movie, then all of a sudden she's a drugged out (maybe??) stripper who gets manhandled by Alex? I guess she gave up on the ice-skating thing. She messed up her first routine where everyone came out for her...guess that was all it took for that dream???

Anyway, besides the scrambled incomplete story, at least this movie is known for it's soundtrack. ""What a Feeling"", you hear that in like every 3rd commercial on TV...same for ""Maniac"". Lots of other nice songs like ""Gloria"", which didn't take off like the first two. Lots of people involved in the production would go on to other more famous projects. Like Giorgio Moroder, Jerry Bruckheimer, Joe Eszterhaus, and Irene Cara.

But to end this review, I liked ""Flashdance"" well enough for what it was. Pure 80's nostalgia. So many quirks I liked in this thing. It was clearly shot on-location, which was nice. With all the unknowns starring in the movie, it was entertaining to see all of the 'Fakes' in this. Michael Nouri was a great hybrid of Willem Dafoe and Al Pacino. There was a great Glenn Close clone in there too, lets see...Lucy Flippin it looks like. The bad standup comic-slash-cook was the spitting image of a young John Belushi. This movie has to have the highest amount of people going ""Is that so-and so from that hit movie? Yeah, I think so...actually nope...not them."" Just saying - there are lots of 'covers' of more famous actors in this movie, the first movie I've watched where I've noticed that. Plus, speaking of Nouri's character - I thought he would turn out to be some sort of rapist or serial killer, just from how the movie portrayed him. He had a menacing look about him. Like he was up to something. The way he kept sneaking up on her, his weirdly emotionless interactions with Alex. Just kept thinking he would go after her and the John Belushi look-alike would save her and end up her boyfriend. The movie hints at this several times, but John Belushi-alike just fails most the movie. At least he had a semi-decent set after a rather, shall we say, unfortunate opening.

Three out of five stars.",1482105600,3,3435,4.568181818181818

The universe is sparse enough of genuine facilitators that such a response was absurd.  When the universe genuinely provides what a person wants and needs, acceptance and ""going for it"" is the only appropriate response.  Fortunately Alex shaped up to make her mentor Hanna posthumously proud of her.

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

249072,5,6300214184,"WOW, what a movie this was. It looks really good now on Blu-ray and the music is really good for it, too. Made in the early 1980s it focuses on a female dancer named Alex who dreams of becoming a real dancer much like her Grandmother. She is working as a welder and as a dancer at a local club. Through the course of the movie, she begins an affair with her boss, which is not a good idea by the way. He eventually helps her realize her dream of being in a real dance Academy and to get out of the bar dance scene in which she earns part of her living. She achieves this through hard work and determination. The dance scenes are great, although quite a few of them are not actually Jennifer Beals, but body doubles. Still back then, to watch this and think that a woman doing welding work for part of her living and making it into a Dance Academy is pretty darn good. She definitely had the will and motivation to do it and it was a positive thing to see and view. I loved the movie and it brings back a bit of nostalgia for me as I was a junior in high school then. Jennifer Beals, thanks for an inspiring movie.

249073,4,6300214184,While it was so obvious that Jennifer Beals was not the one dancing  it was still a good movie.,1451001600,,95,4.0
249074,2,6300214184,"I first saw this movie when I was a little kid, and that's when it should be viewed- the only thing that stands up decades later is the choreography. Jennifer Beals plays teenager Alex, who spends every waking moment in some kind of demanding physical exertion, be it biking to her welding job, welding at her welding job, dancing at some kind of dance/strip club where the dancers seem to have professional choreographers, working out at home, working out at the gym, etc. She's young and acts young - which makes it extremely creepy when her much older boss starts hitting on her at work. When she repeatedly turns him down by sensibly saying she doesn't want to date the boss, he retorts, 'You're fired, pick you up tomorrow.' Gee, it's always funny when your boss 'pretend fires' you so you'll date him.

Alex brings him home the first night and strips off her clothes under her oversized sweatshirt - classy, I tell you. The boss soon learns what it's like to date a teen when she throws a rock through his window and has an emotional meltdown because he takes his ex-wife to a concert. Then Alex gives fellatio to a lobster at a fancy restaurant, and does some more stripping there. Later on, her boss/boyfriend gets her an audition with a premiere dance company and instead of thanking him, she has another meltdown. All of this would be somewhat amusing if the guy was her own age, but as it stands it's just disturbing.

Oh, and someone should have made the wigs look more realistic. Even as a kid, I could tell whenever it wasn't really Jennifer Beals dancing.",1450483200,,1570,4.5836298932384345

249934,3,6300214184,"Mood lifter of a movie about dancing and the need to fulfill dreams. Poor acting all around and the best thing going for this movie is the music. It brought back memories of seeing it when it first came out. Seeing it in a theater like most people used to do and viewing it in another era gave a positive light to it, whereas; when I watched it again tonight on my computer, it was different. It didn't make me feel the excitement I did when I first saw it. I looked for other things such as acting skills, plots, and relationships that make a picture big. I could have done without the useless traffic cop scenes directing traffic and rhythm trying to push the scenes through. Also, I knew the actress didn't do all the dance scenes herself; a stand-in-professional-dancer took care of that. Nevertheless, I will agree with another viewer about it being best to buy the soundtrack. The music will keep you motivated, if nothing else. As much as I liked it the first time, it did not hold the merit of a high star rating, in my opinion.",1438819200,,1036,4.401041666666667

She also dances in a bar doing ""sexy numbers"" without really taking her clothes off. She hangs out with her friends who ""have dreams"" while they work in their blue collar jobs as well. She is a ""good Christian Catholic""  as she goes to confessional when she is not sleeping with men without being married too them, talking crudely, and sitting with her dates in her living room while taking her bra off. So in other words this movie is just garbage. It reminds me of that similar genre back in the 70s/80s pushed on the young people of the era--Fast Times at Ridgemont High type stuff. Just filth. The lead actress is just laughable as an actress. She is horrible. And she obviously cannot dance as it is clear that the not-so-closeups of the woman dancing is not her. Not a good actress. Not a good dancer. So why have this person? Oh well.

It's actually rather stereotyped in characters and plot (yes, the boss of the company actually falls for her...right), but the heart is there. And just like ""Footloose"", the dancing is kinda cool!

It tells the story of a young woman who wants to break into the world of ballet but who has never taken any lessons. She is a dancer in a nightclub which features showgirl-type acts (without nudity or even partial nudity) while holding down a job as a welder during the day, all while living in an abandoned warehouse. Her romantic attraction is no less than the owner of the company for whom she works. Thus the stage is set fr the poor-girl-makes-good (with a bit of help from the well-positioned company owner) as she gets her chance to try out for the ballet company. At times the film is a bit schmaltzy, but it's fun to watch for the music, the dancing, and the simple romantic story line.",1436832000,2,800,4.375838926174497

As I saw in the critical reviews at the time, the dancing and music were good while the plot was stupid. They were certainly right about the last part. The characters and storyline were hardly believable, especially all the inexplicable temper tantrums from Beals.

Unfortunately the music and dancing weren't very good either, and the movie actually was pretty boring. How it got so hyped is one of the Great Unanswered Questions. Recommendation: give this movie a pass and see the far superior movie ""Footloose"", from the same era but better in every respect.",1434412800,6,664,4.724137931034483

250390,4,6300214184,"Released in 1983, Flashdance is a drama/music/romance film starring Jennifer Beals as, Alex Owens, an 18 year-old welder in Pittsburgh who dreams of being a professional dancer and longs to be accepted into a prestigious school. She dances at a nightclub in her spare time, which is contrasted by the strip club across the street, owned by a sleazebag who tries to lure the respectable dancers into his seedy lair (Lee Ving). One of her friends aspires to be a figure skater (Sunny Johnson) and another friend a stand-up comedian (Kyle T. Heffner). Meanwhile her tall, dark and handsome boss takes a liking to her (Michael Nouri).

This is an entertaining dance flick with the requisite early 80s soundtrack. All the dance sequences were performed by the uncredited French dancer Marine Jahan, who later sued the producers for not crediting her (the brief break-dancing scene was done by a dude). While the wide-eyed Beals and Jahan are in top shape and comely enough, I favor Sunny (the skater).

I was impressed by the quality characterizations for a relatively short sports movie. I call it a sports movie because thats essentially what it is  Rocky with a female protagonist and dancing instead of boxing. I also like the Pittsburgh locations. Despite my positive feelings, the less-popular Heavenly Bodies, which came out 9 months later and stars cutie Cynthia Dale, is superior IMHO.

The film runs 95 minutes and was shot in Pittsburgh and Los Angeles.

250528,4,6300214184,"Flashdance probably launched the guilty pleasure classics of the 1980's for which future dance movies such as Footloose and Dirty Dancing followed suit. It was smashed by the critics at the time of its release due to many formulaic movies themes applied to it but it managed to gross more than $100 million at the box office.

The story involves teen-age Alexandra ""Alex"" Owens works as a welder at a steel mill in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania during the day, and as a dancer at Mawby's bar in the evenings. She lives alone in a converted warehouse with her pet dog, Grunt. Despite a lack of formal dance training, she aspires to be accepted by a prestigious dance school, the fictional Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance and Repertory. During one of her performances at Mawby's, she attracts the interest of Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), her boss at the steel mill, and he learns that Alex is one of his employees.

Alex goes to the Conservatory to ask for an application form for an audition, but runs out of the building when she realizes that since she lacks formal training and professional experience, she would have to leave much of the form blank. Alex's dance teacher and mentor is a retired ballet dancer named Hanna Long (Lilia Skala), who encourages Alex to pursue her dream of becoming a professional ballet dancer.

After Jeanie falls twice while auditioning for an ice show, she loses confidence in herself and becomes a dancer at The Zanzibar, where she performs in the nude, and Alex goes to the strip club to rescue Jeanie. Alex and Nick become lovers, but he has an ex-wife named Katie (Belinda Bauer), and they have a hostile encounter in a local restaurant. Nick uses his contacts at the Conservatory to secure an audition. Just before the audition, Alex goes to Hanna's house and learns that she has died. At the audition, Alex falls at the beginning of her routine, but starts over and completes the routine successfully. In the final scene, Alex runs out of the Conservatory building with a smile on her face and is hugged by Nick, who gives her a bouquet of red roses. She gives a rose to him, and the film ends with a freeze frame. The ending of the film does not say directly whether Alex wins a place at the Conservatory as a result of her audition.

The movie is characterized,just like what I've said in the first paragraph by numerous elements of guilty pleasures that a viewers seeks in an entertaining movie such as romance,teen-age memories,formulaic themes,predictability,interesting characters, great choreographed dance scenes, and sequences in the style of music videos. Aside from that,it has many memorable original 80's songs classics such as ""Maniac"" by Michael Sembello;""Lady, Lady, Lady"", by Joe Esposito; ""Gloria"" and ""Imagination"" by Laura Branigan; ""I'll Be Here Where The Heart Is"" by Kim Carnes and the Academy Award-winning ""Flashdance... What a Feeling"" by Irene Cara. Of course,the final dance scene at the audition is also worth the mention.

In terms of acting,Jennifer Beals shines in her film debut as Alex. She gives an electrifying performance despite the lack of depth given to her character. Also,she is very engaging as we do care for her character to succeed in her aspirations as a dancer.

Overall,Flashdance can be considered as the ultimate guilty pleasure classic. It was made not to please the critics but to please the audience who wants to relax and would prefer not to go into deep thinking but rather seek pure entertainment when watching a movie. With this objective,the movie delivers.",1418860800,,3552,4.901830282861897

No one doubts that Jennifer Beals is good actiz, but curiously was somewhat negated for dancing ... Why they chose encontes? The film is about a girl who dances right?
Its dual sings while in some scenes can be easily seen that is not her, and that it is not at all like even in a musical number comes with his face painted white and still is very noticeable.
Anyway the film is sympathetic and even feet move alone, because G. Moroder produced and composed a truly complete soundtrack with unforgettable songs like What a feeling it won the oscar and Maniac, who was also nominated, and the musical numbers are impressive too.

GREAT MOVIE--- terrible management of credits.",1389744000,,377,5.032258064516129
250667,3,6300214184,"That Oscar-winning title song buzzes in your ears long after the movie has stopped. The attraction here is youthful spirit and a pulsating score, because the weak story is merely a conduit for the song-and-dance numbers.

The plot is every young woman's daydream come true as tomboyish Jennifer Beals holds down a macho job as a welder by day, but performs erotic dance numbers in a club at night. It's not a strip club, so her morality remains intact. She dates her wealthy boss (Michael Nouri) and practices hard for the day she can audition for the upscale, local dance school, even though she has no formal training.

It is malarkey, of course, unless you view this as a total romantic fantasy, but it works because you are carried along by the sheer force of the energetic, boisterous, MTV-style imagery by director(Adrian Lyne). Beals is a plus as the stubborn, pouty, somewhat eccentric young woman made all the more interesting for her driving ambition.

In the end, she is aided by her Prince Charming, who arrives bearing favors. Mind you, this is not the same as a rescue, as Beals is one rather tough damsel who does just fine on her own.",1389312000,,1150,4.683168316831683

250702,1,6300214184,"Let's go back in time. You're an 18 year old worker at a steel mill who dances at in a weirdly artsy but still sexualized manner at some club. A club where it's considered funny to let one of the male workers get on stage to practice his stand-up comedy, which consists almost entirely of ""stupid Pollack"" jokes.

So a patron of this schizoid establishment sees you dancing and wants to do more than eye-hump you. Turns out he's your boss though, the owner of the steel mill. So he follows you out and asks you out. You don't want to date the boss though, and leave.

Then he does fun things like follow you around in his sports car while you ride home on your bike. Is that stalking? Yes, that's stalking.

But he asks you out again. You again say you don't want to date the boss. He says ""that's ok, I'll fire you."" Is that sexual harassment? Yes, that's sexual harassment.

But it's so sweet that you cave into it. Despite the fact that he's really, really older than you. We don't know how old the steel mill owner is than tough little Alex. But we know that the actor playing the owner is 18 years older than Jennifer Beals, and that Alex is 18 in the movie, so let's say he's twice her age. And her boss. Who threatened to fire her if she didn't provide sexual services. Who followed her around when she said she wasn't interested.

I know that many of you have fond memories of this movie, but this is utterly disgusting. It's a heaping pile of male sexism triumphing over female independence, with a side of offensive ethnic jokes.

It's no wonder that the director also gave us 9 and a Half Weeks (again a younger woman needs to be taught about sex by an older man who sorta forces her to do things) and Fatal Attraction (spurned woman becomes a psychopathic warning to adulterous men, but more as a message for men to be picky about their adultery than anything else).

Let's see, we got Foxes: sexualized teens seeing how far they can go (too far).
Indecent Proposal: Robert Redford would like you to pimp out your wife.
Lolita: no explanation needed.
Unfaithful: like a reverse Fatal Attraction, except the cuckolded husband gets to kill his wife's lover.

Other than the WTF? Jacob's Ladder, Adrien Lyne seems to crawl out of his man-cave every few years to make another film that puts women in their place that somehow women are glad he did it to them.",1388188800,4,2366,4.422988505747126

250789,4,6300214184,"Some parts are pretty bad. I bought this after seeing the Musical was coming to Indy. I very vaguely remember this 1983 movie - mostly for the music and when Jennifer Beals removed her bra under her sweatshirt while the guy watched fish eyed.

The musical play was better because it moved the story along better and in a 'cleaner' fashion. I really enjoyed seeing it so I looked the movie up on Amazon and bought the Blu-ray.

The music is just tremendous. Acting ranges from bad to pretty good. Cinematography was interesting - especially the use of light and dark.

The Blu-ray picture was top notch as was the music and sound in general.

I would rate this a 7.5 to 8.0 out of 10 stars - recommended for 1980's music lovers and anyone who like a good but not great movie.",1384128000,,774,4.391608391608392

250901,5,6300214184,"If you are or were a critic in the 1980s, you hated this movie and everything about it.

The non-critics amongst us (which is 99.995% of the civilized world) love it and adore it more than most films. In some cases, it helped (and continues to help) inspire anyone with dreams.

OK. Jennifer Beals did not do her own dancing (done by Marie Jahan), but...who cares? Is that supposed to be necessary? Remember that Ms. Beals is playing a fictional character. She does not have to do her own dancing if she doesn't want to. It might have added to her character to do that, but it was fine the way it was done. So there!

Admittedly, It doesn't have much of a plot. It's more of a loosely connected string of music videos. But there's enough of a story to have emotional impact for anyone going through that kind of situation (which is a great many of us).

The fear of not having the financial and social pedigree to contribute to artistry and somehow having the courage to succeed anyway is the main theme. Beals pulls off this role and that attitude with honesty and integrity. And Giorgio Moroder's score provides the soul and feeling necessary to make this a meaningful film for millions around the world.

Then you're watching the right movie. With little in terms of realism, Flashdance doesn't expect the viewer to believe in its story.  Its aim is more metaphorical... ""Go for it"".  This is a fun movie that has great music, cheesy outfits, and a positive and predictable theme.  As I'm only 21 years old, I can't comment on the nostalgic aspect of this movie.  However, I do know that of all the majorly popular 80's movies I'm aware of, this is the one I've heard my mom, who was in her late 20's at the time of release, talk about most. Overall, it's cute and fun. The only negatives I've heard about this movie are that there is too much music and that it's not believable... I'm not sure what people expected from an 80's dance movie, but these things didn't bother me a bit.  Just enjoy it, people!",1377388800,3,964,4.4375

250985,5,6300214184,"I have loved the energy, the emotions, the dancing, the music, listening to the songs and watching the videos.  Finally seeing it in its entirety was a wonderful experience.

The characters went through some very familiar struggles to succeed, frustrations taken out in anger, and managed to work through it all.  Heroism was tempered by fear of failure, which made eventual triumph more real and more engaging.

I watch monsters and superheroes and war movies so this was a great way to reconnect with reality.",1375660800,,511,4.976470588235294

251033,4,6300214184,"I grew up around Pittsburgh in the tail end of its days as a steel producing powerhouse and visited periodically as the rust set in, and  I never saw it as beautiful or even photographic until I saw this film. The most beautiful thing in town in this film is the striking (and very young) Jennifer Beals. Somehow her charm overcomes the complete absurdity of the film's premise and a good deal of many of the less-than-appealing supporting characters, who frankly seem more typical of Pittsburgh than Beals herself. I suspend what I know about the setting and life and enjoy Beals, the dance performances, and the simple premise of the winning long shot at success by someone with a lot of strikes against her. Leave your mind at the door and focus on the eye candy.",1374364800,,766,4.591240875912408

Unfortunately, Flashdance is based on the contemporary theory that humans are incapable of maintaining an attention span of more than a minute or two and suffers from being edited into thousands of quick little bursts of video. The cinematography, however, has some interesting twists and angles that make the film worth studying.

So if you want to see Bette take her bra off underneath her sweatshirt (does she even take her bra off in six seasons of The L-Word?), then this is the movie for you. If you want to see Jennifer Beal dancing, however, you will be disappointed ... they used a stand-in.",1372982400,,696,4.8

I was just beginning to succeed at doing what I had wanted to do since childhood.  Unfortunately, someone in my life at that time was equally dedicated to derailing that dream, so it didn't happen.  The dream, and the opportunity to achieve it, were lost. Sad, yes. But hopeless, no.

This fantastic, energizing movie makes  me even more determined to see that my children and my grandchildren have every opportunity to achieve their own dreams.  I have and will continue to cheer and do whatever it takes to help them along the way.

This wonderful movie is too full of hope and joy and drive to allow anyone to sit and mourn the loss of their own dream.  Pick up the pieces, move on, and help the ones you love - and share their joy when they reach for their own stars!

Take your passion, and make it happen
Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life

Just like that, you're drawn back to the days of leather, rock, legwarmers, and the movie that made everyone believe in themselves a little more.
In 1983, Jennifer Beals touched us all with a character so full of strength and determination that she faces a firing squad of judges who will decide whether she gets into a prestigious dance school, or be left in the dead end jobs of welding and exotic dance.

For those of us who have already been touched by the incredible strength of this movie, the decision to buy came right at the beginning of this review in the lyrics to the title song by Irene Cara. But for those of you who have not shared this experience, and must rely on the long, drawn out, and sometimes pedantic reviews to find some nugget that will leave them intrigued enough to actually watch the film, there is only one thing that can be said.

If you haven't seen it, you're probably the only one you know who hasn't, which means you will be made fun of endlessly until you do.
So, spare yourself the shame and humiliation, and give it a go.
What can you lose?

251427,4,6300214184,"""Flashdance"" was a landmark film of the 1980s, singlehandedly sparking the fashion trends of off-the-shoulder shirts, legwarmers, and ripped jeans, not to mention fueling the aerobics craze. It was a fun film at the time, but the set-up seems stranger now than it did then: A fresh-faced young woman, Alex (Jennifer Beals), is a welder by day and exotic dancer by night, while she lives in a converted warehouse and dreams of being a ballerina. Alex has saved enough money to support herself if she should join Pittsburgh's dance repertory company, but she's too intimidated to apply. One evening her boss Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri) sees Alex dancing at Mawby's Bar and is enchanted. The beginning of a bumpy romance.

I've been revisiting movies of my youth to see if they were really worth remembering. ""Flashdance"" is. There must have been a lot of knock-offs, but I haven't seen anything quite like it since. Much of the film's appeal is in Jennifer Beal's unaffected performance. Alex is so natural that she easily overcomes the hackneyed plot and its various contrivances. Alex is also only 18 years old (and looks it). I haven't seen a film that treated a young person as an adult in 20 years. And, of course, there is the iconic dancing. The dance sequences aren't as technically impressive as I remembered them, but Jeffery Hornaday's jerky choreography creates a strong image. It has an aggression that I haven't seen in a dance movie since.

""Flashdance"" is, on one hand, a by-the-numbers combo of a romance and one of those films where the protagonist must find the courage to pursue her or his dreams. But it's a particularly good example. Not only does it create strong visual and auditory images -with its chart-topping, award-winning soundtrack, it's not entirely saccharine. The working class characters seem authentic, and their dreams don't always come true. Produced in 1983, there is a bit of 1970s malaise in the film that prevents it from getting too sweet. That's the kind of thing I noticed in retrospect that was not obvious to me the first time I saw it. So this one is worth a re-viewing.",1276732800,7,2117,4.845303867403315

Standing in her way is an abundance of profound social obstacles, not the least of which is her boss at the welding factory, Nick (Michael Nouri), who is also her boyfriend. Alex strives to be accepted into a prestigious ballet academy, and she is furious when she realizes that her boyfriend might be pulling strings for her behind the scenes. Along the road to self-discovery and independence, Alex also struggles to accept love, come to terms with her own stubbornness, and find the inner strength to turn her lofty dreams into reality.

This is ""Rocky"" for girls. (But, let me tell you, the message isn't lost on us guys either.) Yeah, it's got its crude and rude moments... but isn't that a more-than-appropriate description of the very world in which we dwell? By 2009 standards, it's so very very tame. Sad, really.

But mixed with the banal of this movie is real beauty. (Not to mention Jennifer Beals herself. Is she really almost 50?) The beauty of lives facing fear and failure head-on. And triumphing over it. Exaggerated movie fantasy? Perhaps. But who really sets the boundaries for our lives other than ourselves? I would argue that there are many real-life examples of success that could trump those portrayed in the film.

Noticed by her day boss, Nick Hurley, one night at Mawbys, he takes a special interest in her and a romance develops as soon as she is `fired'.  After finding out her dream, his membership on the Art Council becomes valuable when he pulls a string and she is granted an audition.  Hard work and talent takes her the rest of the way.

The story won a Razzy for the worst screenplay, but if it were so insipid, the music and visual dance sequences were genius, easily making up any deficiencies.  Each dance sequence is almost a MTV feature every time, and draw on a number of cultural references.  Songs like `Maniac', and the Oscar winning `What A Feeling' turned this soundtrack and movie into a classic.

With the 25th anniversary of Flashdance so close, the time is good to re-experience the phenomena one more time.

251536,4,6300214184,"The 80's produced some of the corniest movies of all time but I must admit, this one was not bad. I think this movie was more of a trendy film and a cultural statement than a masterpiece. It's about a young woman named Alex who is a steel worker by day and an exotic (non nude) dancer by night. She dreams of becoming a professional dancer one day but has no formal training. A very cool scene is when she goes to the snooty dance school to apply and is wearing dirty work boots among all the elegant dancers and she runs out of the building because she is so intimidated. Alex ends up dating a rich guy, which makes for some clever lines and funny scenes. I think Jennifer Beals is gorgeous in this movie and in great shape! Overall, this is a movie that was great in it's day not because of a huge budget or great acting (though the acting is pretty good) but because it made a huge statement and influenced fashions of the 80's. The message here is: You can do anything you put your mind to and should not be afraid to strive for the things you dream of! I also liked the fact that this was made in a time when strong female characters were just becoming popular. Don't watch this movie if you want something deep and meaningful. This is more of a nostalgic and 'fun' movie for when you want something not-so-serious. The movie has a refreshing innocence about it. I found it to be very inspirational and I thought it had a positive message for women. Honestly, it made me want to cut the collar out of my sweatshirt so it hangs over one shoulder, throw on a pair of spandex and leg-warmers and hit the gym and accomplish some of MY goals!

251538,2,6300214184,"This movie is one of cinema history's seminal examples of a soundtrack carrying a movie to success. ""Saturday Night Fever"" from a few years before is another example, but that movie could actually stand on its own. Jennifer Beals' torn neck sweater and table dancing routine aside, I don't think this one could.

I understand this movie is near and dear to the hearts of a lot of 80's children, and I will agree this is one of the all-time great soundtracks of cinema. The problem is, the movie's plot is a slow-moving, wasted opportunity.

Physically, Beals is sexy enough to keep your attention, and her portrayal of working-class girl in a man's job striving to express herself was a pretty novel idea when this movie was made. But her unsympathetic personality and mediocre acting undermine her character. Come to think of it, the acting all around is a bit weak.

But that's not the problem. The movie suffers from two fatal let-downs. The first is the plot itself. Feminism-affirming depictions aside, it's pretty simplistic, unimaginative stuff, even for a dance movie. What's worse is how slow it all moves. The drama sequences in-between dances drag on, straining your patience and sympathy for the character's plights.

The other more tragic flaw, since it is a movie about dance, is the cinematography. While it's certainly not the worst cinematography ever, (check out ""the Limey"" next time you want a headache.) the dance sequences look like they've been salvaged from scraps on the cutting room floor. We're supposed to be moved by Beales' character's natural talent, but for most of the movie we never get to see her do much except walk and pose in a crazy mashup of bad edits. By the time the final dance scene finally comes along, the drama of her audition performance is ruined by drawn-out, bad editing. It almost seems the judges let her into Juliard simply because she was able to stay in the air for longer than a minute.

Perhaps I'm a purist for asking for good dancing onscreen to consist of more than rapid-fire editing. But if it's a movie about dancing, one would think the least they could do is show dancing. Many movies before and after Flashdance managed to get this right (""Saturday Night Fever"" certainly did, to its great success), but maybe nobody told this movie's director. It's a shame.",1158019200,19,2325,4.8025

It serves as a vehicle for the wonderful selection of songs and dance sequences.  However, I think this version of the movie is missing a few scenes?  I would rate this movie version with 5 stars had it been unedited to me.

If memory serves me, didn't Alex receive a letter from her friend, Hannah, when Alex discovered Hannah passed away?  Isn't there a reconnection at the end between Mickey and Alex's (girl)friend whom the latter was dating?  Wasn't there more of a story build-up between Alex and her boss?  If this version is cut in anyway, I prefer getting the complete and unedited version.  I find this version incomplete somehow.

""Flashdance"" comes up and derisive laughter emits from the elitist swine.  A few months later same film was playing free of charge at the student movie theatre.

Jenny comes calling again.  How has this confection held up?  Very well, thank you.  For sure it's predictable, preposterous, and formulaic.  If the formula works, why complain?  What is the legacy of this cultural milestone of the Reagan era?  It probably begat ""Showgirls"", ""Striptease"", and ""Coyote Ugly"".  It also spawned a porn parody, ""Fleshdance"".  In the eighties Paramount seemed to have it's finger on the national zeitgeist with films like ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", ""Footloose"", ""Top Gun"", ""Crocodile Dundee"", and ""Beverly Hills Cop"".  What did that say about us as a people?  Darned if I know!  Irene Cara got an Oscar for the title song(Martin Scorsese still doesn't have one).

251575,2,6300214184,"Believe it or not, I actually wanted to watch this movie.  I've seen almost everything else Adrian Lyne has done and respect his shallow talent enough to be interested in his early efforts.

(I watched _Jacob's Ladder_ because I remembered an intriguing preview on a VHS cassette I watched as a kid and learning that it was a significant influence on _Silent Hill_ sealed the deal; My girlfriend owns a copy of Lyne's version of _Lolita_; _Fatal Attraction_ was a girlfriend induced rental; I watched the TV version of _Indecent Proposal_; I haven't seen _9 1/2 Weeks_ but I read the book.)

Flashdance is also one of those pieces of pop culture that are so influential that you recognize references even if you've never seen it.  And I always wanted to hear the song ""Maniac"" in its original context, so when I found it on an acquaintances shelf I popped it in.

So, how was it?

Not too bad.  Not great by any means, or even really that good (_Lolita_ and _Jacob's Ladder_ are both quite good) but interesting enough to keep me awake after a long day of work.  The plot is a by-the-book ""believe in your dreams"" story with really lame dialog, but its development is intercut with extended dancing sequences that are so long and frequent that at times it felt like I was watching an abstract silent film.  I don't know squat about dancing, but the choreography seemed innovative, at least for its time.

I can't even remember the names of the characters, but all in all, I have to admit that it was kind of neat.

Also, if you watch it with the subsequent 20+ years of movies in mind, _Flashdance_ can be seen as sort of an omen of all bad things to come from Hollywood:  It's a movie by a director whose only previous experience was in music videos and commercials, one whose screenplay was an early effort by hack Joe Esterhasz and was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer!

I must say that the movie stands up pretty well despite its age. It could be that the story of follwing one's dreams is timeless. It also doesn't hurt that the movie starred the beautiful Jennifer Beals who unfortunately hasn't been seen again in ages.

The story of welder by day and dancer by night is well known. One could say that it became a cultural phenomenon in the eighties. Looking back the movie brings to mind some good memories and some memorable music(Who could forget the theme song by one hit wonder Irene Cara).

This film is not by any means something that is indespensible to your film collection but serves its place as a sort of sweet reminder of a what seems too distant past.

251622,5,6300214184,"I've watched this movie several times since it first debuted in the early 80's, and I always end up being pulled in - even though I know the ending now by heart!

""Flashdance"" is about a young girl (about 18 or 19) who has the dream of becoming a famous dancer one day.  Up until this point in her life she has been self-taught, but she realizes that in order to make her dreams come true, she will need to find a way of being accepted into one of the well known (more snooty) dance schools.

Since it doesn't look like this will ever happen, she takes a job as a welder by day, and does exotic-type dancing (not stripping) at night.  But her dreams of becoming a ""real"" dancer are never far away.

In comes her welding boss - an attractive, older man who finds this young, tough, beautiful girl intriguing.  They begin to date and, as a favor to her, he pulls some strings to get her an interview at the best dance school in the area.

When she finds out that the interview was set up by him, she becomes enraged - as she is of the belief that she needs to do it all by herself.  So the question is, will she decide to go through with the interview/assessment anyway?  If she does, will she get in?

I won't answer these questions in case you haven't seen this movie yet.

Overall, this is a ""teen-type"" drama that still has the power to draw in us 30-somethings - probably because it reminds us of our youth during the 1980's.  It has a good storyline & great music.

Classical dance is a ""dead art"" anchored in the 19th century. It has no real connection to the culture of late 20th century USA. The steel industry in America - a dying industry in a dying industrialized town (Pittsburg). What is neeeded is  genius to revitalize what is now dying or irrelevant. Enter Alex. Scenes shot in the flashdance bar clearly show she is not the best dancer, her strength is somewhere else. During the course of the movie the camera dwells on the street breakdancers, the cop directing traffic, the efforts of her friend, the failed figure skater. Until the climax we never see the full dance routine for her rehearsal at the classical dance school. When we see it it's clear Alex has borrowed from everybody - the dancers at the bar, the cop, the breakdancers, her friend the skater. It's all there in the rehearsal routine. New art is born, art relevant to Americans of the late 20th century. This is what genius is.

I think just about every teen age male had a SEVERE CRUSH on Jennifer Beals at that time , including myself.  In fact , I am still enamored by how good she looks to this present day.  She is now I think 42 and really has not changed at all from the pictures I saw when I went to [...] I just recently reviewed the film again a few days ago which makes it only the second time I saw it.  I found it to be very illuminating and it transported me back in time.  I got the same enjoyment as I did back then. True , a bit corny in some segments of the film , but what the heck , it was the 80's and thats the way it was.  Although J.Beals did participate in some of the dancing scenes , the majority of the dance scenes were done by a French dancer by the name of Marine Jahan (some people do not know this).  Initially , when I found out some years ago , I was a little disappointed to say the least. Make no mistake , this is an awesome film and I am still a fan of J.Beals. I have just witnessed some of her other low budget films and was impressed by her acting talents.  Unfortunately , she will always be labeled with the antiquated stereotype of Alex Owens in Flashdance.  I can live with that.  Also , I have just recently read that she is doing a series called the L Word on Showtime.  I'll have to check it out one day.  Without going into to much detail , the whole thesis of the movie is built around Alex Owens (Jennifer Beals) who is afraid of her ultimate dream which is to be accepted by a prestige dance acedemy in Pittsburgh.  Scared to audition , she is then prompted by her boyfriend and she finally auditions and is accepted.  Even if you did NOT grow up in the 80's , you will inherit some enlightment after watching this film.  Finally , I think that the film exhibited a moral code of ethics to the viewers as well. Rather than dancing in some sleeze nudity bar , the main character (Alex Owens) decides not to be influenced by some other bar owner to come and dance for him.  Out of all the 80's dance films that were out during the 80's decade (and there were some dumb ones), this is by far my top pick.  This movie will indeed give you a little adrenaline rush after you watch it.

However, while I was too young to see the movie, I knew the soundtrack by heart thanks to my older sister.  My mom finally decided I would be allowed to watch the movie when it was aired on NBC in early 1988.  Needless to say I loved it after all the years of waiting.

Everyone knows the plot,  welder by day, dancer by night.  Jennifer Beals was an unknown when she made this movie, and the movie transformed her (briefly) into a sensation.  She had a hard time following this film up,  but luckily due to Showtime's The L Word, she is back on top of her game.

Flashdance is not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination,  if anything, it's some of the worst character development (save Beals' Alex) a movie this big has ever seen.  But all is forgiven when the music comes on.  This movie was made when MTV (when MTV meant music) was beginning to take off... this was in many ways like a series of music videos interspread with story.  From Maniac to Gloria to What A Feeling, this movie emphasised on music in a way unseen except maybe Saturday Night Fever.

I have seen Flashdance countless times, and I rushed out to buy the DVD the same week it came out, because I wanted it that badly.

I hope Paramount will give us a special edition DVD along the lines of Footloose... Beals is hot again, they can always bring her in for an interview or something like that.",1105142400,,1457,4.285714285714286
251672,5,6300214184,"""Flashdance"" is the movie that got me hooked on dancing, and I used to love it to death. After reading bad reviews that said it is just a music video with extra scenes, I've realized that it is true, but that doesn't stop me from loving this movie. It is about an 18 year old girl named Alex who dreams of going to the Pittsburgh dance company, but she can't afford it. She lives in a broken down warehouse, and works as a welder by day and Flashdancer by night. She doesn't strip naked, but strips down to skimpy leotards. The most tittilating scene is probably when she is doused with the bucket of water. The cinematography on that shot is just brilliant! Anyway, she falls in love with her boss, who looks like he's WAY too old for her. Her friend Jeanie wants to be a professional ice skater, and Jeanie's boyfriend Richie wants to be a stand up comedian. They both make an attempt to pursue their goals, but Alex is to afraid to apply to the company; everyone there is rich and glamorous, with high heels and fancy clothes. Alex walks in with big poofy hair, thick boots, and army jacket, and beat up jeans. She has an elderly lady named Hanna who guides her along the way. No one is really sure of Hanna's relationship with Alex; is she her grandmother, or simply an old ballerina? Another setback for Alex is the bar across the street from the one she works at. The owner is a total sleazebag, and treats Alex like an object. Alex finally musters up the courage to audition, in the most energetic and triumphant dance scene ever filmed. The song she dances to is the Academy Award winning ""Flashdance...What A Feeling"", one my favorite songs ever. If you are a dancer or just like watching people dance, then go out and rent this movie.",1104278400,3,1744,4.419254658385094
251673,2,6300214184,"Flashdance, supposedly inspired by a real-life welder-turned-dancer, comes off as a pretty lame flick, but it does bring back my fond memories of the early 80s.  The story itself is predictable, uninspiring, and ends too abruptly.  The dance numbers are ok, nothing extraordinary, although the girls do have beautiful legs.  To be honest I found the movie boring.  Jennifer Beals's interracial beauty was about the only thing that allowed me to finish watching the movie.

The DVD is enhanced for 16:9 widescreen and preserves the film quality pretty well.  The audio is too loud on music and too soft on dialogs.  It doesn't have any extra features.  But then, for $12, you get to watch some 80s dancing and some strip club scenes and relive the go-go days, so what more can you ask for?",1101254400,2,788,4.785185185185185
251674,4,6300214184,Flashdance is one of the most remembered films of the 1980s.  It is full of rythym and fast paced tempo that most people were used to seeing in the popular dance movies like Footloose and Dirty Dancing.  Jennifer Beals plays her best role as the young wannabe ballet dancer who strives to make it in a rough neighborhood.  This film whould be nothing without its music or dancing.  It is one of the best date movies too.  I highly reccomend this film to anyone with a dream or anyone who is a fan of films from the 1980s.,1084060800,2,521,4.275510204081633
251675,5,6300214184,"The film is an image of what the 1980s were, of Pittsburgh in the 1980s, this temple of heavy industry coming to an end and starting to look for a new future, due to its industrial crisis. Yet this film has not lost any charm and meaning. The young Alex, an 18 year old girl, is the symbol of this city, an industrial worker during the day and a dancer at night, with a dream : to join the ballet company of the city. Industry producing art. Industrial work producing the dream of art. Alex is a willful young woman who follows the road of her desire, if not ambition, but keeping her ethics pure all along. Pure by looking for love and not pure pleasure. Pure by refusing any favor in her quest and longing for a victory that can be called her own because it owes nothing to anyone and any help from outside herself. Pure because she salvages her friend from becoming a gogo girl in a shady place where dancing is just some kind of dressing for enticing prostitution. Pure because she finds her energy in an old friendship with an old dancer who is encouraging her in getting started and competing for an audition that could open the door to a new artistic life. Pure because she is not soiled by all those who would like to drag her down into the mud of selling her young beauty and art to the gloating eyes of perverse and lustful males. And she can succeed because she never lets her dream die. In life the dream is the almighty sign on the road to epiphany and Alex will meet with this epiphany of hers, the one she has dreamed of for years and she can find only in the energy that comes from her mind and her body, from her unconquerable soul. This film has not aged in spite of all the changes that have occurred in our societies. The dream is the energizing force that leads the way, too often of some Cross, to transcendency.

Jennifer Beals works as a welder by day, but does sexy dancing in a club at night, practicing constantly for a chance to audition for the formal dance school, tho she'd never had formal training and feels inferior to the others in the audition lines.
As reality, it won't float. But as an energetic and boisterous vehicle for a sweet story and some of the best music and dancing ever seen on screen, it's a five-star winner.",1071619200,43,612,4.675925925925926
251707,5,6300214184,"Of the top five or so movies that have had the greatest impression on me, no movie had the personal impact as did ""Flashdance."" I was going through, what I like to call, a ""character building"" period in my life after having moved to California a little less than a year before this movie came out. Long story short: no job, no car, no money when a friend of mine called and said he wanted me to go see ""Flashdance,"" with him- his treat. After a little coercing, I gave in.
Yes, the movie has a typical or predictable plot, but I would not call it weak because of the actors and the memorable characters they created. The viewer is bonded to the characters in this movie- one cares what happens to them. The cinematography in this movie is great, especially the opening credit scenes of Pittsburgh as Alex is riding her bike to work. No, this movie doesn't have ""5-star"" acting... I think that would have ruined this whole movie. It has, what I would call, ""real-life"" acting: not that polished and maybe stumbles a bit here and there. It gives this movie its strength, not a weakness.
Not only are the musical scenes great, the background musical interludes chosen also help set the feeling in many of the scenes... ""Lady, Lady, Lady,"" sung by Joe Esposito playing during a tender romantic scene between Alex and her boss, and- my favorite- ""I'll Be Here Where The Heart Is,"" sung by Kim Carnes played during one of Alex's low-points in the film.
The highlight of the film is its finale when Alex is auditioning in front of the Pittsburgh Dance and Conservatory Company's selection committee. I would call it one of the greatest movie moments of all time. I stepped out of the theatre feeling I was walking three feet above the ground back to the car. I have never left another movie sensing that level of enthusiasm, exhilaration, and energy. I made myself a promise at that moment that things would get better... and they did too... in ways I never could have imagined at the time. Thank you, Jennifer Beals, for the motivation and inspiration you gave me at that time in my life!
This was one of the most influential movies of the '80's. The DVD picture is clearer and the sound incredible compared to my ol' VHS tape. GREAT movie! If you haven't seen it, buy it and see what positive effect it has on you!",1062892800,96,2309,4.5
251708,4,6300214184,"When this came out it was really a visual triumph.  It was directed a la MTV by Adrian Lyne.  When seeing *behind the scenes* type shows about this movie it was clear that this was a difficult project to get finished...with much contoversy.
Visually, it was quite different.  The sets are gritty and smokey (too smokey for many execs).  The style is quick and the focus is on the music and the danicing and to a lesser extent the love story between the two very appealing stars (jennifer beals and michael noiri)
By day jennifer beals works as a welder and by night she works as a dancer in a seedy club doing amazing dance routines (okay, Marine Jansen does the dance routines).  Her dream is to go to a snooty dance school even tho she has no formal training.  The love story is between her and her boss at the welding job, who is also on the board at the dance conservatory.
The movie launced the ripped sweat shirt style.  Debatable as to whether that worked outside the movie...but it did work inside the move.
This is really a very good escape.  Its fast paced and fun. The dancing is amazing and you will be hard pressed to tell what is actually Jennifer doing the danicing and what is Ms.  Jansen (In the final scene, which was actually re-written to make it more exciting...  there are actually 3 dancers...Ms Beals, Ms Jansen and a young man who does break dancing.  Its quite an amazing feat of editing.  Its seamless)  What it lacks in writing,  and it is lacking there, it makes up in energy and visual appeal.  If you haven't seen it, make a point to see it at least once.  If you have seen it...rip and sweat shirt, make some pop corn and see it again...",1062633600,,1669,4.37012987012987

The 5.1 Dolby Digital Soundtrack is top-notch for a movie from 1983.  The movie had an extremely weak plot.  Like others have said, what is Hannah's relationship to Alex?  Why did she go to confessional all the time and then have sex with her bf 2 minutes later?
My biggest gripe is what happened to the break-dancing scene?  I've seen that part of the movie in numerous break-dancing tapes and the scene in the DVD was much shorter.  I mean they showed Crazy Legs 3 times, Frosty once, and the 2 poppers, but where was Prince Ken Swift?  This movie is supposedly what brought break-dancing into the mainstream back in the early 80s, but yet the DVD which has no features at all, shortens it a lot.

The basic plot is that Alex, played by Jennifer Beals, is a welder by day and works by night as a dancer in a bar.
Her biggest dream is to become a famous dancer and go to a prestigious dance school.
As can be expected, a romance blooms between Alex and her boss at the welding factory.
Alex is repeatedly asked out by her boss and she shoots him down every time.
He finally asks her why she won't go out with him and Alex tells him that she dosen't think that it is a good idea to go out with the boss, (And she is NOT referring to Bruce Springsteen when she says this)
Her boss then gives her what I believe to be the funniest line in the entire movie: ""Fine.  You're fired.  I'll pick you up at eight.""

Why just 3 stars, then?  One complaint is that the music track does not play well on the DVD.  This could just be my copy, and I was too lazy to try to return through Amazon to see if I just got a bad disc.
The main reason is LACK OF EXTRAS!  If a studio is going to re-release a movie on DVD and charge over $ for it, there should be plenty of extras.  How about the original music videos, or a documentary on dance in the 80s - especially breakdancing which had one of its first broad/public exposures in this film?

I can practically recite the whole movie.  The music is fantastic of course.  My favourite scenes are when Alex and her boss are being romantic and the song ""Lady"" is playing, and also when Alex is riding her bike home on a rainy night and the boss is following her home.  Talk about romantic.  The dancing in the movie is also fabulous.  I liked all the numbers they did at the bar, Tina Tech rocked the house!!!  I also like the fashion in ""Flashdance"".  It started alot of trends, sort of that nu-wave grunge thing.  Jennifer Beals did a fantastic job in this film, and so did the rest of the cast.

251715,4,6300214184,"FLASHDANCE - is one of those films back in the 80's that when it opened up it became a huge success. I think mainly because it was a Rocky or Karate Kid-type movie. It had an upbeat theme, great music and characters that had nothing and achieved their dreams.
Directed by Adrinne Lynn (Fatal Attraction, Indecent Proposal) the film launched Jennifer Beals ( The Bride, Vampires Kiss ) into stardom over night. Her love interest, played by Michael Nouri ( Captain America, Black Ice ) also had achieved recognition for this film. Even the model/dancer Cynthia Rhodes (Staying Alive, Runaway, Dirty Dancing) went on to achieve great success.
The story is simple. As small eats-coast/mid-west town girl has a dream of going to a real ballet school and become a professional dancer. The school is elite, expensive and requires an approval process that included an audition. She is non confident and has little self-esteem.
The other thing that makes her feel less adequate is the fact that though by day she work in a welding mill - by night she is a club dancer in a local bar. The odds are against her - and except for her closest friends - no one can think she can make it. Guess what? I leave the rest for you to enjoy. Very positive ad upbeat film about any one can achieve their dreams if the keep on trying and believe in themselves.
There are many DVD extra's on it and it would have been nice to hear the cast commentary, or the directors AND the cast (the cast is always more interesting then the directors commentary - unless its Mel Brooks, Woody Allen, Billy Crystal, Carl Reiner - former actors turned directors) but they must have not wanted to pay them. (Paramount that is.) Overall a great film for the spirits to be lifted for everyone who watches it. Let me know what you think. (12-10-02)",1040515200,2,1804,4.570987654320987
251736,4,6300214184,"I was 15 when this movie came out, and it was the catalyst for a cultural revolution.  It completely changed the music and fashions of the times and truly defined the 80's.  During the summer it was released (summer of '83), you couldn't listen to the radio for more than an hour without hearing ""Maniac"" or the Flashdance theme song at least four times.  All the girls, myself included, emulated Jennifer Beals's style of dress in the movie: cut-up sweatshirt, tight mini skirts, high stiletto heels.  This movie cause an absolute furor!
You cannot watch this movie and not want to dance!  I should also mention that it caused a huge fitness craze, with leg-warmer-clad women flocking to the gyms and the aerobics studios in droves.  I suspect it's what encouraged Jane Fonda to churn out all those aerobics videos in the 80's.
As much as I adore this movie, it bothers me in the fact that it holds an ambivalent attitude toward women.  On one hand, it empowers women, as evidenced by Alex Owens's (Jennifer Beals) ambition, drive, and independence.  But on the other, it exploits them: Many of the men view women as nothing more than sex objects.  The saddest part comes when Alex's ice-skater friend Jeannie loses all faith in herself after falling during a crucial competition and resorts to working at the local strip club.
Its treatment of men is none too just, either.  It sends out the message that wimpy but good-hearted men like Richie Blazik, the cook-cum-stand-up comedian, will always come in last, and sleazeballs like strip-club proprietor Johnny C. always succeed in their evil ways without retribution. To wit: his goon busted Richie in the nose, and it was he, Johnny C., who wheedled Jeannie into stripping at the club.  He even ends up as her man! Go figure! (What decent man allows his girlfriend to work as a stripper?).  I think the scales were trying to be balanced by the addition of Nick Hurley, the guy who hailed from the rough streets of Pittsburgh to make good.  He was truly a knight in shining armor, but he is ineffectual at best.

Director Adrian Lyne's sense of style was the culmination of what the early 80's MTV era was all about without ever compromising quality or artisitic integrity. His work never bordered on cheapness or rip offs. Flashdance was an original...

The plot concerns 18 year-old Alex, welder by day, dancer by night, who lives in a converted Pittsburgh warehouse loft and dreams of becoming a ballerina as her grandmother once was. (How Alex has managed to acquire exceptional dance AND blowtorch skills by her 18th birthday is never explained.)
As Alex ""chases"" her dream (she can't even work up the nerve to take an application to the local dance school from its frosty secretary), things happen. What happens and why is also largely unexplained, but the main sub-plot concerns the blossoming relationship between Alex and the owner of her construction company (who is perhaps twice her age but owns a Porsche). One minute Alex is shy and reluctant to date the boss; the next she's slipping off her bra while asking him if he's ever ""seen"" the music. On a later date, she's seductively sucking crab legs in a chic restaurant when his ex-wife (looking like some lost tsarina in her enormous fur hat) comes out of nowhere and provokes a verbal cat-fight, provoking Alex to reveal her revealing ""tuxedo vest."" And when Alex finds out that her man has used his influence to get her a dance audition at the school, she transforms into a wild-eyed, chain-smoking, trenchcoat-wearing hellion. (There's also a sub-plot about rescuing a friend from the ""bad"" nude dance club--as opposed to the good one where Alex dances--that is little more than melodramatic filler . . . well, there's a lot of filler, and still the movie barely makes 90 minutes. Not that that's really a bad thing.)
The soundtrack is engaging; some of the dancing is exhilarating (even though Jennifer Beals didn't do most of it!). However, this movie is neither a romance nor a drama: it's a long, warped music video. Taken as such, it can be fun.

The director, Adrian Lyne, got his experience directing TV commercials, where the entire message has to be conveyed in 60 seconds, and in Flashdance every moment is contributing something. The key is the cinematography. Leonard Maltin calls Lyne a ""visual stylist"", and he is, but he's more. He takes Roman Polanski's cinematographic innovations and pushes them to new limits; the camera tells the story.
When you watch ""Flashdance"", watch how light and camera angle are used. Light: Pittsburgh light, hazy, smoky, dull, reflecting off puddles, blazing from lamps, dim, bright, strobe, whatever; lighting carries the mood of each scene. As for camera angle, in most movies we are observers, outside the movie, watching the actors. In some of ""Flashdance"" that is also true, but then in many places the camera angle shifts so we are inside the movie, seeing what one of the actors, or several of the actors, see at that moment. It just pulls you in. If you're not familiar with the film, the first time you watch it wait for the final ""audition"" scene, and watch how the camera is first an observer, before the dancer enters the audition room, then sees from the dancer's view as the audition begins, and then shifts to show us what the judges see, as the dancing becomes compelling. I don't know about you, but this grabs me and pulls me in; I could watch that scene five times running. And there are many other scenes in which camera angle is used similarly but not quite as obviously. I give this movie four stars; I would give it five if the music and dancing were as well integrated with the plot as in some other movies.",986169600,14,1937,4.650145772594752

251769,2,6300214184,"Flash -- yes.  Dance -- well, only if it's still the 80's.  It's all about selling yourself -- on the job; in the audition.  The only character with any integrity is the dog.  And, in the end, even he ends up with the  greaseball.  What's with that ribbon?  MADD?",959212800,3,263,4.244897959183674

251772,5,6300214184,"It is pretty special for a movie to last this well and to get better with each viewing.  The music from the 80s is great.  The plot is an inspiration.
The next time you watch it, enjoy the work of the  cinematographer in composing the scenes and lighting them.  I appreciated  the decision to set the movie in Pittsburgh, and then making sure that the  city plays a starring role.
Bravo.",936835200,5,387,4.380281690140845
