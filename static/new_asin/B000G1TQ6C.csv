8128675,2,B000G1TQ6C,"I was expecting an actual video, but this was just a PowerPoint-type presentation burned onto a DVD.  It pretty much only consists of many jpegs with narrative audio.  Although it was fairly interesting, it wasn't worth the premium price at all.",1267056000,,245,4.951219512195122

8128677,1,B000G1TQ6C,I found the DVD nothing more than family slides and not worth the price. The narrator had poor diction and mispronounced words. For the cost you would think a professional would have narrated.,1203638400,,192,4.848484848484849
8128678,5,B000G1TQ6C,"Jerry Smith had the guts to take on a rare project; the painstaking hiking of the mountains of forgotten Eastern Washington ghost towns and the dusty archives of libraries both local and distant to gather information on soon-to-be-forgotten relics of our near past.  Rare coins and US Calvary uniform buttons are but a few of the treasures that he has located and catalogued so diligently.  Shards of Mason jars and tobacco tins hiding hidden, forgotten wealth near homestead foundations remind us of how much folks trusted the banks in those times and made sure none would profit from their hard-earned sweat.  Filmed on location, Jerry's DVD documents the now torn-down relics of mining camps and ore mills that once graced the cliffs of Eastern Washington's famous Okanagon region.  In addition to the European culture of the old stomping grounds from prospecting days, Jerry's DVD recounts the trails of the Indian tribes that met and traded with the early pioneers that put Washington Territory on the map.  From graveyards to floorboards under old saloons, Jerry takes the average Joe on a memorable walk through the spider-web infested, low-down, rusted junk of yesteryear in search of the richness that made the American West so unique:  guts, gold, and curious conquest and exploration.

Move over Mark Twain.  Jerry Smith has a DVD that will curl your mustache and warm your stomach as it weaves through the dusty, surly canyons of lost prospector dreams and paydirt.",1150675200,4,1477,5.074380165289257
8128679,5,B000G1TQ6C,"Fritz E. Wolff, Washington State Division of Geology and Earth Resources:

""The time watching Jerry's DVD was well spent, resulting in a top-notch product. In his DVD, Jerry takes you back in time to the Boom Town days of yesteryear and brings to life the ageless Old West mining-era days of Boom Towns, miners, prospectors, and pioneers. Yet, the DVD goes far beyond providing simply a historical account.  This includes over 211 outstanding photos and locations from long-lost, famous ghost towns and mines in Northeastern Washington State. The DVD will certainly keep the spirit of the Old West alive and well for many years to come.""",1150588800,5,637,5.0
