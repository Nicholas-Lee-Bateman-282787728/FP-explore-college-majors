8241216,1,6301928644,"Martin Mull can be hilarious when he wants to be, and that's what I was expecting. However, this tape is completely mislabeled; it's not stand-up at all. What we're 'treated' to is a collection of small town people playing instruments badly, unfunny sketches, and drawn-out stories with no point. The few guest stars do nothing, despite their best efforts, to save this waste of film. Avoid. This will only lower your opinion of Mr. Mull, a man who is capable of much better.",1118707200,2,475,4.734939759036145
