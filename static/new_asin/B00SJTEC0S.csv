6991050,5,B00SJTEC0S,"If you've seen my other reviews here on Amazon, you know I hate ""Spoilers"" and this is a film that is hard to review without giving any. I will say that the only review posted before mine (by My D) does a good job and IMHO, you are ""safe"" reading it. But honestly, it's even more fun to discover it for yourself. I didn't even read the short blurb on the back of the package before watching it and am glad I did that.

This is a ""black comedy"" - true and simple. And even saying that is giving something away (but not much). Tautou has those amazing eyes and she will draw you in.

What wasn't mentioned in My D's review - and I hope will be useful to those planning to get this DVD - are the following facts:

The film is not new. It is from 2002. You can tell immediately when you see the lack of cell phones and there are plenty of pay phones in scenes. I see that there are copies of this movie on an earlier DVD release but prices are high. This one has a friendlier price.

The subtitles are on the TOP of the screen (instead of the bottom) and are easy to read because the white letters are edged in black and, thankfully - there are no white backgrounds when the words appear. And the subtitles are not an option. I saw no set up option to turn them off.

There are no bonus features here either other than trailers.

For folks who like something different I can recommend this film. I'm glad I discovered it.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6991051,4,B00SJTEC0S,"A FULL REVIEW --- NO SPOILERS

This unique tale is difficult to describe without giving too much away, so I won't venture much further than similar information found in movie promos around the net.  It's important to understand this is NOT a romantic comedy as it may appear by looking at the cover.  It does have very charming moments and comedy that contrasts the situation.  This relatively early (2002) Tautou film may not be as famous as some other films like Amelie, but was very well received and well rated by critics and fans alike.  I will explain further below, but the story is told from two perspectives.  This is not necessarily new, but does allow the director to contrast the perspective in interesting ways.

THE PLOT (again, no spoilers):  Angelique is a budding young artist in love with a successful cardiologist Loic.  Loic lives next door to Angelique who is only house-sitting for wealthy owners while they are away.  The problem is that Loic is married.  Meanwhile, Angelique is preparing for a prestigious art exhibition and needs to produce a quantity of works through the summer.  However, her affection for Loic is distracting her and she even paints him rather than the live model as she daydreams in class.  Angelique's friends seem concerned, David in particular who harbors his own feelings for her and disapproves of the affair.  There is a little tension as Angelique becomes more involved in Loic's life, but we see plans for them to go away on a romantic holiday in Florence.  It appears Angelique is not the only one with a fascination for this tall, successful doctor and many forces begin to apply pressure on her world.  Our tale morphs into something greater and the movie then switches perspective to allow us further meaning.  The story actually restarts and we see everything over again from Loic's view as his life becomes increasingly complicated.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  Audrey Tautou gives a nuanced performance and those famously large and expressive brown eyes belie the greater emotion and thoughts waiting beneath.  Her extraordinary charm allows a natural comedic contrast with the psychological aspects of the film.  The first part of the movie made me wonder for a while what the payoff would be since it's not the normal romantic drama or comedy.  However, the director's artifice of multiple perspectives allows for something more substantial before we're done.  It's an unusual film and I suggest a rental before you blind-buy just to make sure it's for you.",1423872000,6,2510,4.952153110047847

6991055,2,B00SJTEC0S,"This was film made after Audrey's sensational hit of Amelie and it appears to be a piggy-back ride of its success to captivate the same audience but to have turned it into a dark and twisted film. I was in the mood to see a light hearted movie with Audrey Tautou, as I really like her work in Amelie. This film started out innocent and sweet with Audrey in the flower shop picking out a pink rose. That was about 15 minutes of bliss, soon followed by dark and creepy events. Near the middle, there was a closeup of a plucked human heart, followed by murder. This film is a copy of a combination of stellar works by other writers and directors. ""Sliding Doors, Amelie, Jaw"". There is no originality here, even though it has been ranked with four stars.",1505433600,,751,4.371428571428571
6991056,4,B00SJTEC0S,"French movie with auto English subtitles (no need to turn on closed caption).  Audrey Tautou is a great actress.  I didn't want to see her in this role as I always want to see her in positive roles, but I have to say she proved that she can play a bad person as well as she does a good person.  She was very convincing, but I prefer her playing nice characters.  Excellent movie, but it takes an hour into the movie before you truly realize what is going on and it starts to grab your attention.

The first 40 minutes, the movie shows you the world as seen by Audrey Tautou's character.  She has a job as a waitress at a local restaurant and a hobby of painting/creative art at an art school.  She tells everyone about how she is in love with a married man who is a doctor.  Everyone in her circle of friends thinks it's a bad idea to have such a relationship, but she is completely fixated on this doctor to be her future husband/lover.

The next 40 minutes, the movie takes you back to the beginning, but this time it gives you the perspective of the doctor and the life he lives.  You will be shocked at the difference of two perspectives of the same story.  Once you understand the two sides, the movie takes the next 20 minutes to merge the two relationships together into one continuous timeline.  It makes you wonder what would you do if you had a situation in which you don't understand how your life is turned upside down by someone you don't know or have done anything to invite disaster.

Excellent plot/story.  Good acting by everyone.  Excellent directorship.  Audrey Tautou showed off her acting capability that demonstrates she is not just good at beautiful love stories, but she can be nasty too.  I was expecting another beautiful love story because it's Audrey Tautou, but instead it's a psycho drama.",1503014400,3,1819,4.463636363636364

6991058,4,B00SJTEC0S,the different perspectives of this story were expertly and consistently portrayed,1501632000,,81,6.454545454545454
6991059,5,B00SJTEC0S,"The ending conveys a thoughtful insight into the complexly impulsive problem-solving techniques fundamental to the human condition... Maybe that's just me thinking about it that way because her character resonates with much of my own experiences (not all, but in a metaphorical sense, quite a few). I love love love films that have this style (won't spoil it by specifying which). It's worth watching all the way through.

Neither a happy nor sad ending. I personally love those.

Excellently whimsical. A playful thriller. Also, Ms. Tautou's expressions make this all the more intense... I don't want to ruin it, because part of its greatness exists in that it's mysterious, but really... If you're up for a bit of a psychological ride without becoming too existentially dizzy, this is spectacular.",1501372800,2,799,5.186046511627907

6991062,5,B00SJTEC0S,"Honestly way better than I could have ever expected, and also a 5 star flick.
From the very start, I quickly wrote the movie off as being terrible- from production quality, to the scripting & acting.  I almost lost all interest in the movie; it seemed like a quickly drowning romance-thriller with nothing new to offer.  But thankfully I read the reviews, because the second half of the movie is very much worth the wait.
Personally, I only tend to watch action/horror/suspense/mystery type movies, so it may seem weird that I found a palatable romance to fit my taste, but after watching the entire movie, you'll certainly understand why I enjoyed this so much.  Definitely recommend watching to anyone, so don't let the hard-to-endure beginning deter you, and don't let the cover picture either!",1499817600,3,797,4.932835820895522

Loic survives the attempted murder and Angelique is placed in a psychiatric ward for erotomania where she creates an image of Loic out of the drugs that she was supposed to be taking.

6991099,4,B00SJTEC0S,"Yes, these are different writers and director, but this story, like Amelie, a year-or-2-earlier film, also engages the talented Audrey Tautou to play its fantasy-driven protagonist, Angelique. Only this time, the character isn't full of love and light, wanting to bring joy to the world, and often accomplishing her goal. Angelique also operates in secrecy, but here, it's of the malevolent kind. In this psychodrama, almost thriller, Angelique, an accomplished, grant-winning art student, fixes her obsessional and delusional, amorous sights on Dr. Loic Le Garrec (Samuel Le Bihan), and no one will stand in her way. The rest of the story remains to be seen. The first half of the film focuses on the imagined relationship from her psychopathic perspective. And I'm not certain if it is the fault of the writing or if it is just tedious and unpleasant to hang out that long with such an unsympathetic character and her macabre grinning. The second half tells the real story from the perspective of the rational characters, to whom the villainous events are happening.  I found that portion considerably more compelling and engaging.

8698697,5,B00SJTEC0S,"I love french cinema, and I adore Audrey Tatou. This is one of my favorites that she has starred in. It's quirky in a way that only french cinema is, and a great story. It's very enthralling. The only Tatou film I'd rate above this one is Amelie, of course.",1513900800,,257,4.16
