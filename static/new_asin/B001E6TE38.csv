If you are an English teacher, middle or high school teacher, this dvd can  make a one of a kind and educational lesson, teaching the story elements plus discussion or writing about the music, visuals, or geography.
I have watched this probably 50 times and never get tired of it.

8296855,5,B001E6TE38,"I remember showing the 16mm film of this movie, back in the nineties, to school children in the public library where I used to work as children's librarian.  I was thrilled to see it is available in DVD.  The kids always loved it, and it is so well done that I never tired of seeing it no matter how many groups I showed it to.  The location (a lonely East Texas farm with a weathered shotgun shack and dusty fields) and background music (primitive blues) set the mood perfectly.  Set during the depression, the movie begins with the narrator introducing Hannah, a young widow who still mourns the loss of her husband but who is kept going out of love for her little son, John Paul.  But ""in them days"", the narrator relates, ""there was meanness loose on the Earth.  Meanness could walk up on two legs like a man and even play the fiddle.""  The ""fiddle man"" had evil powers given by Satan, and when he uses his magical powers to snatch John Paul away, Hannah has to call on all her inner strength to carry on.  She goes looking to get him back -- and that is as much of the plot as I'll tell here (don't want to spoil it for anybody).

 It is a story of love and courage fighting back against evil, and the visual images in the film are the perfect accompaniment for the tone of the story; they are strong but simple and straight-forward, letting the viewer feel the dryness of the run-down farm, the glint of the sun in the bottle-tree, the lonely feel of the wind blowing the sheets Hannah is hanging on the clothesline, and the love that strengthens and nourishes Hannah and her son.  The evil force of the fiddle-man is evoked with subtlety; although the film is both moving and haunting in its feel, there are no real horror scenes, and it can be shown to students in lower grades (but not preschool/kindergarten) without fear of scaring them.  I highly recommend this for schools and children's libraries who want to offer children something of American folklore without the slickness of a Disney fairytale.  (Not that I dislike Disney's fairytale-based feature movies -- but those gorgeous full-length productions leave the homespun texture and strong, simple flavor of ""folktale"" far behind.  This movie feels like a visualization of an orally transmitted tale.)

For other great children's folktales (high quality, intelligent, non-saccharin), I recommend all the films in Tom Davenport's series of folktales titled  ""From the Brothers Grim"" (series title).  Film titles inclue ""Mutzmag,"" ""Bearskin,""  ""Soldier Jack: The Man Who Caught Death in a Sack,"" ""Willa: An American Snow White,"" ""Ashpet: An American Cinderella,"" ""Rapunzel,"" ""The Frog King,"" ""Hansel and Gretel: An Appalachian Version,"" ""The Goose Girl,"" ""Bristlelip,"" and ""Jack and the Dentist's Daughter.""",1337299200,2,2774,4.828752642706131
