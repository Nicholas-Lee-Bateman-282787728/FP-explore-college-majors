Now let's crunch some numbers. This collection costs $29.99, and contains 4 films. When we divide the price by the number of films, we find a cost of $7.49 per film, a great deal for any crime film fan, for this diverse and excellent set of gangster films. I hope this information is helpful. Cheers!",1397088000,20,1428,4.476923076923077
