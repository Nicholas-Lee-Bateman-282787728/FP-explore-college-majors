Winged Victory is a wartime film that covers the American experience from a wide variety of perspectives, following a team of buddies going to military flight school and on to combat zones.
It speaks peace to the newlywed wives and mothers whose husbands entered the air force, and the anxiety difficulties, and worries they faced at home.
It speaks waves of sympathy to those whose physical condition did not permit them to fly in the air force in spite of their best hopes and efforts, as well as those who faced the choice of accepting a less than glamorous role back in a day when every young man dreamed of being a pilot.
My wife and I both have ancestors with whom we can now identify better because of the way these individual situations were addressed.
Winged Victory honors the thousands of military veterans who worked in daily service capacities as mechanics, field medics, and good old latrine duty in addition to the rigors, fear, pain, and discipline of combat.
It touches those who lost lives or loved ones during a solo training flight, those who experienced the joys of graduation, the solemnity of the oath of office, and Christmas in the Pacific.
In its dramatization, it surely misses many experiences that are unique to war and the sacrifices of our ancestors, but it would be hard to ask for a better representation or story that tells the story of every man, woman, and child during wartime without actually detailing each story at length. It covers quite a lot of bases for being only 2 hours 10 minutes in length.",1464220800,,1549,4.677655677655678

7919783,5,B00004CLDX,I looked for this for years and though the quality is poor I would pass it on to my children.  It is very close to what their Father went through in Cadet training in WW2.  He flew B-25's in Africa and made the Air Force his career,1371945600,2,231,3.893617021276596
7919784,5,B00004CLDX,"The movie, when you dismiss the Typical Hollywood treatment of WWII, was a great period piece depicting the mores and attitudes of the time.  Having grown up in an Air Force environment, I found the Base and flight line scenes quite interesting.  I only saw the movie once before (back in 1944) when it was shown in conjunction with a live band and revue at Randolph.  Suddenly, I was back there again, that's how moving it was!",1365379200,2,428,4.532467532467533
7919785,3,B00004CLDX,"This Hollywood film made during World War II showcased the Aviation Cadet program of the Army Air Forces.  It's full of interesting scenes -- training camps, testing and classification, disqualification boards, solos, parades and graduation, deployment to the Pacific, maintenance, the PT-13 and the B-24, medics, camouflage and antiaircraft defense, and a homespun unit Christmas show among them.

The plot included a generous share of wartime movie cliches, stock love stories, soulful farewells, cornball conversations, and patriotic background music.  This ""Hollywood"" dimension of the story, however, runs along with scenes of the hastily constructed barracks, training camps, bases, and towns that were familiar to all who served during the war.  The film also showed the not-so-smooth streaming of tens of thousands of cadets through different phases of training, and spouses sharing crowded makeshift housing as they followed their cadet husbands from base to base.  Watching the film, I thought there was too much singing, but then I recalled hearing that my father led his cadet flight in song while they marched, so maybe there's less ""Hollywood"" to the movie than it seems to our eyes decades later.

There's one other agreeable feature to this film -- spotting impossibly young future Hollywood stars in the cast -- Edmond O'Brien, Karl Malden, Judy Holliday, Lee J. Cobb, Red Buttons, and George Reeves among them.  All the male characters in the film served in the Army during the war.

7919786,5,B00004CLDX,"Winged Victory was the motivational impetus which impelled many of my fiends into the air force during the Korean War. Growing up during WW II, but too young to serve, we identified with the actors, most now no longer with us, as role models. As a successful applicant to the Aviation Cadet Program I experienced many of the events depicted in the movie including washing out of the program just before graduation. Because of a physical deficiency, being unable to pull high ""G"" forces consistently, I almost ""bought the farm"" while flying solo in my jet trainer. I was close enough to the ground to be able to look UP to the tree tops as I recovered. I understand that the rights to the work are tied up in litigation and so the movie has not been available for general release. I cannot think of a more motivational film which more accurately depicts what life was like for young men growing up during WW II.",1295395200,3,910,4.5212121212121215
7919787,5,B00004CLDX,"This Moss Hart George Cukor WWII masterpiece has long been unavailable because Kitty Carlisle, Hart's widow, who owned the rights, had refused to let it be released on DVD.  PLEASE Hart Estate: i.e. her two children, LET IT BE SEEN in this century!  I have been trying to see it for years.  It was once available on tape but not anymore.",1189382400,6,337,4.491803278688525
