5579134,5,B00BCP83R4,I have seen the video before and used it on retreats for personal and group refection and discussion. It is well and can be used for a number of different things. The potter's calm demeanor as he talks about the Scriptures is both challenging and comforting at the same time.,1436313600,,275,4.52
5579135,5,B00BCP83R4,"Such a beautiful picture of how our Lord loves us and doesn't give up on us when we act like ""CLAY""  Wish every household in the country would watch this.",1418774400,,154,4.133333333333334

5579139,5,B00BCP83R4,"Inspirational and amazing testimony of a man with a love for God, for his family, for others who demonstrates God's fierce love for us all through the work of the potter. This brought us to tears. We have purchased 8 copies to share with frinds in need and everyone who received a copy has been touched by God's grace. We even look at pottery now with a new appreciation. Joyce",1405296000,,377,4.4

5579141,5,B00BCP83R4,"I thought David Blakeslee did a beautiful job of describing both his faith journey, and in illustrating his ministry concepts through his art, creating beautiful pottery. As an artist myself, his ability to weave his love of God, and conveying very deep concepts through his work as a highly creative craftsman, with his hands and with his teaching, was beautifully done and meaningful. I highly recommend this DVD. After viewing it, several of us in our men's ministry group decided to show it to the 32 men in our larger men's study group and add a discussion period afterwards, providing a series of questions to get the ball rolling within the breakout groups. It worked beautifully.",1398556800,,687,4.931034482758621
5579142,5,B00BCP83R4,"I have viewed this video twice so far and was very moved by it. As the description on the back cover states,""Blakeslee (the potter) reflects on making pottery as a metaphor for how the Master Potter forms and transforms lives."" In a relaxed and unhurried manner (and with a voice I can only describe as a tender embrace for hurting people),the potter uses engaging and sometimes humorous stories to present ""a fresh perspective on trust and submission to the Master's design and purpose for your life"" as he fashions several items from clay. My three teen/young adult sons even sat through it with interest, especially the firing process.",1373932800,4,638,4.916666666666667

8566368,5,B00BCP83R4,"Excellent autobiography of a gentleman who sees his ministry to ""the people"" through the gentle eyes of his craft. I would recommend this DVD to any one to have in their lending library to loan or give to anyone who does not have peace that they can only get through The Lord Jesus.",1439251200,,282,4.339622641509434
8566369,5,B00BCP83R4,"This is a wonderful program. A great visualization of the scripture depicting the Potter....which is God, and the clay....which is me. Also
realized  I am a ""mug"" and it is o.k.  Have to watch the program in order to understand that statement.",1437782400,,243,4.761904761904762
8566370,5,B00BCP83R4,"The Potter covers many subjects but the most important one is to trust in God.  This man shows his talent, given to him from God, and talks as he spins the wheel forming the clay into beautiful master pieces.  Certainly worth the watch again and again.  Love it!",1437696000,,262,4.416666666666667
8566371,5,B00BCP83R4,We had watched a portion of this in our class on Sunday.  We decided to purchase a copy for our home video library.  It is a wonderful depiction of everything that goes into producing a piece of pottery.  The comparison to our lives is so easy to understand and beautifully told.  Highly recommend.,1437350400,,298,4.566037735849057
