8188070,5,B000P0J0EC,"Tales from the crypt is the best horror show ever made. HBO was stupid to cancel it.

I was terrified of the crypt keeper when I was a kid.

You get all 6 seasons for a real fair price.

There not much to say except that show rocks and that it is a must have for any horror nut.",1372896000,,278,3.6779661016949152

8188072,5,B000P0J0EC,"When I was a little girl, the Cryptkeeper scared the crap out of me. I'd hide behind my dad's recliner when he'd turn it on and cry every time I heard that cackling laugh.

Now that I'm older, I have grown to appreciate this show. I started reading the comics and I was hooked (a link to the comics is at the bottom of this review). The series is taken mainly from the 3 EC horror comic titles (Tales From The Crypt, The Vault Of Horror, and The Haunt Of Fear), but other titles from the EC series are used too. Tons of famous stars make guest appearances, from Brad Pitt to Tim Curry. The stories are scary, and the Cryptkeeper is a fabulous host. John Kassir brings him to life (ha!) beautifully. Beware, the CryptKeeper loves puns and can be corny sometimes. Also, this show is not for children; it's filled with blood, gore, and sex. Whether you're a fan of the comics or just a horror fan looking for something entertaining, this show is for you.

Don't forget to buy the last season too (there are 7 seasons)!

I have to admit i've been disappointed many times when I bought a series or a movie I really enjoyed watching when I was a child but I have to say this did not happen with Tales from the crypt , I'm so glad I have this collection, a true classic :-)",1259366400,,363,3.918918918918919
