8323739,4,B000A6LZEO,"This video was originally released in 1992 on a Laser Disc and VHS. Although several people were confirming that this is an official Brazilian edition, it was never confirmed to be an official release. Most likely it is a bootleg (although a nice one) and you can see that from the DVD region that was set to 0 to fit all the countries. The DVD does not have a booklet inside, so it is just a case with the cover and DVD itself.

If you are a fan of Roxette, I would recommend getting it, since Roxette or/and EMI never thought about releasing an official Live DVD with any of the Roxette concerts (yet?). On the other hand, if you are really eager to see a good live show by Roxette, try to search for Roxette - Live in Zurich. There are also bootleg DVDs of this show. From my point of view, the concert in Zurich was the best Roxette live perfomance. At that time the show was broadcasted live all over Europe.",1217376000,3,913,4.247126436781609
