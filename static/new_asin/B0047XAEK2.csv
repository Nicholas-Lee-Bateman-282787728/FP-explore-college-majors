8418422,3,B0047XAEK2,"I was disappointed that both movies were on 1 disc. I bought it to give Saturday's Warrior to my aunt, and I would keep Star Child.

8418425,5,B0047XAEK2,I loved Saturday's Warrior from when I first saw it... the other was new to me and the second one I would give a 4... still very well done but not quite as well as Saturday's warrior.,1361404800,,183,3.972972972972973
