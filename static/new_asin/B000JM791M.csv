8152130,5,B000JM791M,All these years later the west is beginning to acknowledge the major role the Soviet played in the victory over Nazi Germany. What we have here is the Soviet parade celebrating this victory. You have Soviet dictator Stalin and Soviet General Zhukov who played a major role in the fall of Berlin. I kind of felt it was comical as Stalin was referenced as being a military genius which is far from the truth but dictators do have huge egos. There are many formations of Soviet soldiers from various units. You have the Red Army and Soviet Navy well represented. There is Soviet armor such as the T-34/85 tank participating in this parade. Soviet artillery is included as well. English voice over is included and the footage is also in color. The parade is only 20 minutes long. I found it interesting just to look at the faces of the men who experienced some of the most violent combat in history. Also included on this dvd is the documentary Fall of Berlin which is excellent. If you are interested in World War Two/Great Patriotic War this is well worth the price.,1403395200,,1064,4.575916230366492
