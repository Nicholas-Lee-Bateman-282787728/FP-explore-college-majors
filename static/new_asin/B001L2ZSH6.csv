8317072,5,B001L2ZSH6,"UFC 91, was nothing short of amazing, and nothing short of very enjoyable! Why was this so enjoyable? For many reasons! Read on!

To see Randy Couture back was such a relief! What wasn't such a relief was the man taking him on in the seeking of a title...Brock Lesnar. And despite getting submitted quickly by Frank Mir in UFC 81, a lethal right hand made Heath Herring look like Raggedy Andy in the octagon in UFC 87, and it dictated the pace that led to a unanimous decision. And Dana White and Joe Silva are giving Lesnar the fight that all Heavyweights DREAM of. Brock gets to fight Randy Couture, and he wants to claim a championship he feels is already his. Randy isn't too concerned, and he's always had his ways to win in the past. How about tonight?

The co-main event features Kenny Florian taking on Joe Stevenson. Kenny Florian is out to make a dominant finish, and he wants to show WHY he's the favorite in this fight. Joe Stevenson is upset that he isn't the favorite. He's been reading on the internet about why Kenny Florian is the favorite...hmm. Shouldn't he have been training? But both want B J Penn for the Lightweight title.

This card was great! And ALL 9 of the fights ended up being shown on the PPV!! Here they are, just in case you missed 'em.

Matt Brown vs. Ryan Thomas: Brown took this fight on short notice. Ryan Thomas thinks he's going to dictate the pace no matter where the fight takes place. It ends with a nice submission in the 2nd round.

Alvin Robinson vs. Mark Bocek: Mark Bocek is one of my FAVORITES!! And boy did I love the ending to this fight in the 3rd round! Great win for Bocek, GET OUTTA TOWN, ROBINSON! The UFC ain't for you.

Jeremy Stephens vs. Raphael dos Anjos: Has anybody seen the KO in this one? Highlight reel!

Jorge Gurgel vs. Aaron Riley: Well, we'll all miss Jorge Gurgel, but his performance was worthy of one final FIGHT OF THE NIGHT before the UFC released him. Great scrap!!

Nate Quarry vs. Demian Maia: Nate Quarry's game plan? Just make sure Maia doesn't get him to the ground, and rough him up. Is it really THAT easy against Maia? Unfortunately, a 1st round submission answers that question rather quickly.

Gabriel Gonzaga vs. Josh Hendricks: Hendricks has an impressive record put together, but Gonzaga is a monster! 1st round KO in a little over a minute.

Dustin Hazelett vs. Tamdan McCrory: I was so glad to see this moved up to the main card! And a pretzel maker would be proud, because that's what I thought of before the 1st round tap! These 2 fighters are 2 of my favorite Welterweights. I really enjoy watching them, and look forward to all fights they fight!

Kenny Florian vs. Joe Stevenson: Are you kidding me? This was phenomenal! And after the 1st round submission, the winner announces that he admires B J Penn, considers his a master, but he's ready to KILL THE MASTER! I love it.

Randy Couture vs. Brock Lesnar: And last, but not least. All you can say is...well, what can you say? Great fight, great victory, and respect in shown afterwards.

This is a 2 disk DVD, and COUNTDOWN gave me a whole newfound respect for Brock Lesnar, as well as Randy Couture. I loved this event, and hope others do as well!",1242259200,6,3195,4.459691252144082
8317073,5,B001L2ZSH6,"UFC 91 Lesnar Vs. Couture,  First off people were pissed about brock getting a title shot in his 4th fight, did u see what he did do heath at 87, that was the worst beating ever, He was destroying frank too, but frank is experienced and got his leg, now he is 2-1, and fighting the legend for the belt, I think brock deserved the shot and im glad he got it, and Fedor isn't even in the ufc so leave him out of it,
