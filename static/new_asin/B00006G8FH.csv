1754263,4,B00006G8FH,"I have only seen the first episode of Arjuna, as it was made available on a bandai promotional DVD given away at Otakon.  Arjuna is a very compelling little story that although follows a different story line, reminds me very much of Escaflowne.  Just like Escaflowne, Arjuna follows a struggling high school girl athlete as she takes a mysterious trip leading to what may hopefully become 26 episodes of Anime Goodness.
Sharp mix of computer animation coupled with the painted cell artwork.  In fact, This is the first Anime I've seen with this much CG effect.  Great music, the opening track sounds like a slow paced Yoko Kanno original (although it is not)
I am looking forward to the full release of Arjuna, I can only hope that Bandai rushes these out instead of torturing us with one volume every few months.",1033516800,2,813,4.704225352112676
1754304,4,B00006G8FH,"Juna Ariyoshi and her boyfriend Tokio take off on a motorcycle to watch the sun set.  A typical, romantic act that suddenly takes a wrong turn.  An accident brings Juna (Jun) to a hospital where she dies.  Or rather, she almost dies.  But instead, a voice offers her another chance at life if she will accept the mantle of avatar of time.  Suddenly, she can be Earth Maiden Arjuna - named after an Indian god with a famous bow - Gandiva.  Her task - to save the earth from it's destruction due to human thoughtlessness.
Jun gets no time to slip into the part.  Rising from what was to be her deathbed she meets Chris, her savior, a paralyzed boy.  She is given the Drop of Time (an ancient Japanese artifact that also put in an appearance in 'Blue Seed'), and is thrust into battle with a raja - a spirit created by the poisoning of the earth.  A nuclear reactor is under attack, and if it falls, Tokyo will become a wasteland.
Jun must struggle with her own fear, Chris's cryptic explanations, and his irritating telepathic assistant.  In many ways, the raja is the least of her problems.  When Chris decides that the problem is her own impurities, she is thrust into the forest on a survival exercise that will most likely kill her.  Previously only Buffy had days like this.
The series combines a very strong ecological message with the growing pains of a teen-age girl who has yet to figure out what she wants from life and love.  And then throws in a good-sized dollop of mysticism.  I found it enjoyable, except for the perpetual complaining about Juna's performance.  Nobody seems very sympathetic about her own feelings and fears.  Chris sometimes reminds me of a punishing parent and someone who is trying to save the earth.
Thanks to good illustration and animation, as well as an interesting story line, this first DVD is a success.  Not to mention the score by Yoko Kanno.  But I do think there is room for improvement, both in Jun's characterization and Chris's habit of lecturing.  I agree with the intended message, but I am not entirely comfortable with the relationships being established.  Hopefully, this will get better as Jun  gains in strength.",1050796800,2,2166,4.63254593175853
1754305,5,B00006G8FH,"When I first originally heard of this anime I just saw a picture of Juna in a costume and the words ""Score by Yoko Kanno"" ""Creators of Escaflowne and Macross Plus""  Knowing that I absolutely loved those two series and I love Yoko Kanno's music, and she scores great series/movies 99% of the time, I asked for the first volume for Christmas.
At first I wasn't sure what I thought about this show.  But when I watched it a second time I started to fall in love with it.  I wasn't quite sure what it was that made the series so great, but as I watch more and more episodes I begin to understand.
This series takes things on a somewhat more philosophical way.  It covers serious issues, most of them ecological or enivormental, but there are a few small ones that are brought up later, abortion being one of them.
The animation is absoluetly gorgeous also, using full potential of computer animation that is being used in the newer animes.  The character styles are somewhat symplistic, but eye appealing in their own way.
Bandai offers meager portions of extras, but it's not so bad.  With interviews and a glossary it holds it's own.  The musical score is absolutely beautiful and gorgeous, as one were to expect from Yoko Kanno, and the voice acting is very well done with seasoned Japanese voice actors that the otaku will recognize(Van/Kyo (Escaflowne/Fruits Basket) anyone? >^^<)
Overall the series is very well done, and I highly recommend it.  It comes across with messages that make you ponder over them after viewing the episodes.  Not only that, but they're real life issues, that you can relate to in your very own life.  The characters are real... 3-d if you will, with emotions, feelings, and pain, and it is far, far, from the magical girl anime series I initially thought it to be.",1046304000,,1793,4.62776025236593
1754306,5,B00006G8FH,"After watching the first and second disk of Arjuna, I couldn't help but earger to count the number of days left until the releasing of the thrid Arjuna disk. This animation is among one of the best anime series I have ever seen.
 Its unique theme, characters and story draws me deeply into the Arjuna universe. The relationship between the characters is really detailed. I recommand this animation to everyone above 13 :p.",1045008000,,422,4.780821917808219
1754307,1,B00006G8FH,I am growing plenty sick of US distributors pumping out this evangelion-inspired garbage lacking in originality with hideous design choices and gratuitous use of ugly CG.  Just say no.,1041811200,3,184,5.344827586206897
1754308,5,B00006G8FH,"In the background of the interview with Shji Kawamori filmed at Anime Expo 2002, you'll see someone in costume as Merle from Escaflowne and someone in costume as Renamon from Digimon Tamers.  This is a nice, unexpected bonus.
Overall, if you enjoyed volume 1 of Arjuna, you'll enjoy volume 2 even more.",1041206400,,302,4.8076923076923075
1754309,4,B00006G8FH,"This does look like an average show. The Main character Juna dies in the first episode. From her death she sees a vision of the distant future when man becomes extinct and then sees the cries if the Earth from these creatures called the Raaja. The Raaja are difficult to descibe. They appear in places there the enviroment has been altered where the Earth would have difficulty to heal itself. In other words, these are areas that are heavily polluted. Juna must become the Avatar of time who must fight the Raaja, but not kill them. Why is she not allowed to kill them, I don't think we will get to that on this DVD.
The extras on the DVD are short and do satisfy my curiousity. You will meet 2 of the voice actors. The voice actors are Brad Swaile and Maggie O'Hara. They don't have very much to say, but it is interesting to see the faces behind the voices.
One comment I got from a friend is that this is going to be the Japanimation version of Captain Planet. I can see where he can see that. You do see areas with high pollution, the death insects suffer as we spray crops, drought in some parts of the world, amongst other natural disasters that we see which are common on the news today. Juna the main character is in a Neon color which is just as bright as Captain Planet. There is some excellent CG(computer graphics).whenever the Raaja come into being. This is a good show visually. I am thinking of getting this show anyway for the visually stunnung CG.",1039046400,,1465,4.3699633699633695
1754310,5,B00006G8FH,"I must admit that I was hesitant to add this series to my collection. However when I first saw the preview edition from Newtype USA Magazine DVD insert, I imediately went online to purchase this DVD. For those who fell in love with the popular Escaflowne title, this series will not disapoint. From the crisp and hybrid animation to the very familiar Kanno soundtrack, and innovative story, this series seems to do no wrong.",1037491200,,424,4.743243243243243
1754311,5,B00006G8FH,"I was first introduced to Earth Girl Arjuna through my anime club, where I promptly fell in love with the gorgeous animation and compelling storyline. I soon realized that I was one of the only people there who was enjoying it.
The story of Arjuna is not one that everyone will take to - many people prefer not to be confronted with the realities of the world we live in, and the manner in which ""Earth Girl Arjuna"" uses to showcase the problems with society and the environment has been criticized as ""preachy"" and ""too Captain Planet-esque"" for many anime fans. I cannot disagree more.
The most eloquent review of Arjuna that I have ever read stated this: ""Arjuna condemns no one... it is after all a 'cartoon' that's meant to entertain. However, it seems to ask the viewer to stop and consider one's place in the world and to deeply ponder the things that we do and why we do them."" (Mark, The Black Moon)
Within Arjuna, fans of most genres will find something they like. Arjuna is a social commentary disguised as a 'magical girl' show, wherein an ordinary high school student is given fantastic powers. However, these newfound abilities come to Juna, the main character, with several unhappy effects: first, she has to die before she gets them, and once she has the ability to resonate with the Earth, she discovers that a normal life is no longer an option for her. Eating a fast food hamburger becomes a form of torture as Juna is forced to see and experience the process through which the meat was made; everywhere she goes, Juna is the only one who can see the giant worms called Raaja that are intricately connected to pollution and societal breakdown. Juna's family is not the happily clueless bunch so often seen; her newly divorced mother cannot accept Juna's new life and is breaking down because of it, her sister wants nothing to do with her, desiring only a typical teenage existance, and her father only shows up once in the entire series and has no idea how to handle his child.
As Juna learns to deal with her powers, her fledgling relationship with her best friend Tokio, and the great responsiblity thrust upon her by a mysterious organization called SEED, the viewer is shown scenes of heartbreaking beauty and disaster in a magnificent use of CG-animation. I never really felt that this series was slapping me over the head with a message: on the contrary, ""Arjuna"" expects you to walk away with your own moral, just as Juna is left to solve her problems on her own.
Do not pass this series up - one of the best to come out of Japan recently should not be missed.",1037059200,2,2587,4.577586206896552
1754312,4,B00006G8FH,"Earth Maiden Arjuna is the latest entry in the anime field from legendary Shoji Kawamori (Macross, Escaflowne).  It encompasses an environmental theme, with the premise of a young girl being given a second chance at life, if she will protect the earth as the ""Avatar of Time"".  While I sort of questioned the plot at first, the first 3 episodes on the disc quickly changed my mind.
  We are quickly introduced to Juna, a young high school girl who struggles in life and archery.  After she is involved in a motorcycle accident and is in the hospital unconcious, she is approached by a strange apparition who grants her her life in exchange for taking up the fight against strange creatures called the Raaja.  Not really knowing what she is getting into, Juna accepts and is thrust into a world she simply does not understand.  With the help of the former Avatar of Time, a seemingly lifeless boy in a wheelchair, Chris, and a mysterious organization known as S.E.E.D., Juna begins to accept the life she will now lead.  One of the funnier moments is when oridinary people (her boyfriend) see Juna fighting the Raaja, as they cannot see what she sees, and only see a girl talking and performing strange movements to no one.
The animation is eye dropping, with a mix of hand drawn and CG work, the template of what will be used in Kawamori's upcoming Macross Zero OAV series.  Music is done by none other than Yoko Kanno (Macross Plus, Cowboy Bebop)and her music as usual is glorious and really fits the subject matter well. This DVD features great sound, with a 5.1 mix for both Japanese and English tracks...I didn't listen to the dub version, so I cannot comment on it,  but the Japanese mix sounds fantastic, especially with Kanno's music in 5.1 Dolby Digital glory.
I enjoyed these 1st 3 episodes,and I eagerly await the next disc in this series.",1035504000,,1849,4.661538461538462
7968389,2,B00006G8FH,"The condition is a little less than what was described. The disc looks pretty banged up. I've yet to test it, but if it ends up not working I'll just get it resurfaced since that'll be less of a hassle than returning it. The price was nice, but the condition was lower than described.",1394755200,,284,4.277777777777778
7968390,5,B00006G8FH,"I bought this volume online because I could not find it in my local stores . This series is rather old but the animation holds up fairly good . The animation is not all the matters story is true heart of anime along side with the characters . This is a great series , has so much to teach you about the earth and at times it does get preachy but not in your face preachy without spoiling it if you ever decode to give it a try its very earth day , and recycle and keep the earth clean .

This is some of the first anime series I watched and got started in my anime love , so it holds a special place in my heart .",1383868800,,613,3.751937984496124
7968391,2,B00006G8FH,"I thought the animation was rather poor. They relied too much on whiz-bang computer graphics, and so the cel-style animation of the characters is rather sub-par: it doesn't seem shaded properly. Many of the computer graphics are indeed excellent, but sometimes even they are lacking: one particular shot of ""natural"" forest featured trees that were spaced so regularly as to appear to be a Christmas tree farm.

The characters of Takeo and Juna are pretty well done. Juna is a bit whiny, but she's going through a lot, and that's to be expected. As a matter of fact, this highlights one of my biggest complaints: her mentor, Chris, and his helper (whose name I don't recall) are hateful to her. They constantly berate her for her ignorance (though they don't actually explain much to her), are astonished when she does anything right, and are generally unhelpful and mean.

The plot is pretty standard save-the-world fare, but in this case saving the world is literal: Juna is to save the _Earth_. S.E.E.D. doesn't seem concerned about the fate of the planet's inhabitants, as long as the natural ecosystem is intact. Juna is the new ""Avatar of Time"", which would literally imply that Time is a god, but the only god worshipped here is the Earth. Chris is willing to let her die in order to prepare her for saving the Earth. I got the impression he almost hoped she _would_ die so maybe the ""Avatar of Time"" would be reincarnated into someone less stupid.

Oh, and nuclear power is always bad: better stick with nice, clean coal. Or better yet, stop using electricity altogether. Humans have a lot of nerve using air conditioning.",1101859200,,1630,4.773049645390071
7968392,3,B00006G8FH,"After reading less than stellar reviews about this dvd, the only reason I really picked it up was for the composer of the music, Yoko Kanno, the same genius behind the music of Cowboy Bebop. I figured she wouldn't lend her name to a project that was totally awful. I was pleasantly surprised, with some reservations, by Arjuna Volume 1.
Teenager Juna Ariyoshi and her boyfriend, Tokio, are riding his motorcycle to see a beautiful sunset when an accident kills Juna. While she is dead, a mysterious entity known as Chris offers her a deal. He promises to resurrect her in exchange for her becoming the Avatar of Time. You see, Earth has become infested with demons known as Raaja which in time will destroy our planet. It is Juna's task to purify the planet of these spirits in order to save mankind. She won't be alone. There is an organization named S.E.E.D dedicated to saving Earth who will back her up. She also has some weapons, such as a sacred bow, and a protecting spirit she can summon. She'll need him because the Raaja make Godzilla look like a midget. These first three episodes are mainly setup of the story with Arjuna's origin, her first battle, and her struggle to become the proctector of the earth. Struggle, because as is usual in these types of stories, Chris, supposedly her mentor, talks in riddles, and doesn't just come out and tell her everything. Add to this the fact that Tokio is at a loss as to what has happened to the person he loves.
I felt like the premise of exorcising spirits from the earth and the appearance of these wraithlike Raaja was very copycat-like of Final Fantasy:The Spirits Within. This wasn't helped by the fact that the Raaja are CG animated just like in FF. The CG of the monster looks very clumsy and out of place in the film.
There are some very beautiful scenes in these episodes. It had film quality animation except in the CG Raaja. The soundtrack, as expected, is great. Arjunas's costume takes a little to get used to, a little too Tinkerbell for me, but the series is very good about taking its time to develop her character. It does have a 5.1 Japanese along with
English sound. You can also isolate the score. You can also pick up all the volumes in one Arjuna complete collection set. Would've given it 4 stars except for the CG.",1088294400,,2293,4.541062801932367
7968393,3,B00006G8FH,"I just watched the first 4 episodes and I am getting kind of turned off by the environmentalist type stuff in the series. Wanting to stop polution and stuff is good just keep it out of my Anime. The artwork and english dubbing is verry good, though the CG could have been better in the way of character designs. Hopefully the plot will start going somewhere soon, mabe the next couple of episode will redeem my interest. I still have hope that this series can get better, so hopefully it will.",1074470400,,493,4.428571428571429
7968394,5,B00006G8FH,"In this aptly titled CD, Juna Arioshi (Jun), a young woman who has awakened to an intense awareness of the natural world, finds that her new powers can solve nothing if she is not settled within herself.  She is named after one of the great archers of Indian mythology, and like him is caught in the tension between the need to fight and the need to bring peace.
The ecological focus of the series continues, but at a somewhat lower pitch and the first DVDs.  It is still one of the driving themes, but lectures are fewer.  Instead, the plot and characters step into the foreground to get the message across.  In this DVD Jun discovers that her sister is pregnant and seeking an abortion.  This puts Jun in great conflict, and triggers the theme of the effect of ecological abuse on unborn children.  She discovers one of her co-workers at S.E.E.D. has had to pay a terrible price for human indulgence.
Much of the story is concerned with the relationship between Jun and Tokio, her boyfriend.  As in the DVD, Jun's new sensitivities and responsibilities interfere with their level of communication.  In addition, Tokio is troubled by how little he has to offer the magically empowered Jun.  Even though they try repeatedly to heal the rift that is growing between them, happiness eludes them.  Nor is this helped by Jun's erstwhile friend Sayuri, who is trying to capture Tokio's attention for herself.
With all this going on, the core story line - fight against the wasting of the world seems to step into the background.  But that is illusory.  First we find that the plant where Tokio's estranged father works is about to release a deadly mutated virus into the environment, then Jun must fly to New York City to fight a Raaja.  Finally, Tokyo finds itself on the brink of destruction.
This set of episodes is far better balanced than those of the first two DVDs.  Characters develop and deepen as Jun comes to understand the motivations of those around her.  The plot also moves along at a better clip as sub-themes begin to weave together into a strong story.  And the ecological focus integrates better with everything else.  It is unfortunate that it took 11 episodes to get here, but the viewer will find the overall effect is compelling rather than pedantic.  I think the viewer who is looking for more than a mindless tale of monster slaughter will find Arjuna a satisfying series.",1055548800,,2392,4.695443645083933
7968395,4,B00006G8FH,"This set of episodes comes very much as a surprise after the first DVD.  There we are presented with what appears to be an action drama with a strong ecological message.  There we see Juna's accident, her rescue, and her assuming the avatar of Arjuna, the great bowman.  She fights the raaja that threaten her, is yelled at by nearly everyone, and has a thorny relationship with Tokio.  All the stuff of which a good series can be made.
In this set, the emphasis has shifted to an introspective focus on the relationship between the spiritual and the ecological.  This is fun, but the pace slows down considerably in the process.  The concepts are aimed at an intelligent audience.  I don't think this is bad, but many in its stated audience may find it a bit perplexing.  So a warning - the price of enjoying this series includes having to think about what it is saying.
This set of episodes tells of Juna's rising consciousness of the natural world and her relationship to it.  When Chris, the world's other great telepath, despairs of Juna making the leap, he leaves her on a mountain to learn to survive - or die.  Tokio manages to track her down and they come to the house of an old man who has much to teach.  Juna's mind expands gradually but painfully.
Back in the city, Juna must try to rescue Tokio from a deadly infection that menaces her as well.  Juna's relationship with the boy is full of conflict now that her life has been changed.  Tokio's own frustration had having a girlfriend who is suddenly opposed to all the foods and lifestyle that he loves makes things even more complicated.  The crisis comes when Chris's health, always frail seems to fail completely.
The viewer is left with more questions than answers.  But this is the time in a series when that is to be expected.  There is no lack of filmic invention and artwork in this series, and Yoko Kanno's music is notable.  My one cavil is that it goes to too much length on its subject, which completely distracts from character development and the shibboleth of a good plot.  I noted on the cover that this is the 'extended' edition, and almost immediately wished that they had stayed with the TV version.  I hope that this is a phase the series is going through until its ideas are clear.  On the other hand, if you are looking for a series that is ecologically oriented, this is the one to buy.",1053388800,,2373,4.5
7968396,5,B00006G8FH,"For anyone who loves the environment (and is into anime, of course) this is a wonderful anime, simply because it does make the veiwer aware of the faults of our modern day world - sort of an environmental epiphany.
But as well as having the nice message, the musical score is simply amazing (well, what can one expect from the same person who did escaflwone and macross plus), and teh animation is skillfully blended adn detailed cg, with teh essential simplistic shading of tradtional anime.
THere is also enough interminglign of relationships to satisfy us shoujo fans.",1052611200,,571,4.896907216494846
7968397,5,B00006G8FH,"First, ""Arjuna"" was created by Shoji Kawamori of ""Escaflowne"" and ""Macross"" fame.  This series is definitely on par with those two masterpieces.  Animation, character designs, voices (even the dub), music (two words: Yoko Kanno!) and story are all as amazing as Kawamori's other work, but that is where the comparison ends for the most part.  Further, Arjuna's story is unique, with a intricate, yet not convuluted depth rare in anime.  In short, it makes you really think about the subject matter it explores.  Rather than just throwing out abstract ideals, Arjuna really examines a less common point-of-view about nature, as well as human nature.  Finally, the perspective is offered from a 15-year-old girl as she searches for her identity and faces a lot of very normal stuff along with the supernatural, magical-girl adventure.
I recommend this series for fans of Kawamori, those who love beautiful animation, those who like great character relationship development or anyone who wants to really stop and think about the man vs. nature conflict.  Its not a stereotypical shoujo, magical-girl, mushy plot at all, in fact, its a refreshing mix of top-notch animation and music with introspection.  The DVD release is well done with nice extras and very good A/V.  The soundtrack is a typical Kanno masterpiece too!",1051660800,4,1317,5.1745283018867925
