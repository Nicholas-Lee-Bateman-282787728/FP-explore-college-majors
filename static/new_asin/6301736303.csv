348206,4,6301736303,"Produced by John Wayne, written and directed by George Waggner, THE FIGHTING KENTUCKIAN was a real surprise for me. In fact, the film has a poor reputation among movie buffs. But I personally didn't mind the Czech accent of Vera Ralston who was supposed to play the French born daughter of a Napoleon army's general. I even enjoyed very much the scenes she had with John Wayne and the sensualness she put into Fleurette De Marchand character.

I also honestly admit that the comic situations of THE FIGHTING KENTUCKIAN, all generated by Oliver Hardy, are not always top notch, specially when the gags seem to have suddenly popped up from a silent movie. But I don't disavow the pleasure I had to admire the seduction scenes played by Vera Ralston that alone justify a rental of the film.

A DVD zone John Wayne's reserved shelf.",1178323200,4,828,4.703448275862069
348207,4,6301736303,"For the first and only time, John Wayne appeared in a film with Oliver Hardy of Laurel and Hardy fame, in the 1949 Republic production ""The Fighting Kentuckian.""  Laurel and Hardy had actually made their final American film, ""The Bullfighters,"" and were ""at liberty.""  By this time the comic team was frequently touring Europe and making live stage appearances, where they presented some new comic routines that were, unfortunately, never filmed.  They would eventually make one more film, in France: ""Utopia,"" also known as ""Atoll K.""

John Wayne had a long-term contract with Republic pictures and, despite Wayne's increasing creative freedom, studio boss Herbert Yates insisted that Wayne use Vera Hruba Ralston in this historical comedy/drama.  Ralston had been a Czech ice skater who had fled her homeland when the Nazis came to power; she was beautiful and charming, as the film shows, and Yates fell in love with her, eventually marrying her.  Yates also insisted in putting Ralston in several of John Wayne's films at Republic.  Unfortunately, Ralston had a heavy accent.  This wasn't such a problem in this film because she was playing a member of the French aristocracy who was living with her countrymen in the southern United States in the early nineteenth century.  They had fled France following the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo.

The film has many of the classic elements of John Wayne's action films and is generally delightful.  There are some memorable battle sequences and Wayne's heroic efforts to help the relocated French in dealing with treacherous enemies.  But the real bonus of this film is watching the great Oliver Hardy, who works so well as John Wayne's sidekick.

Loyal fans of both John Wayne and Oliver Hardy have often enjoyed this film and those who haven't seen it will want to see the rare teaming of Wayne and Hardy in a very enjoyable film.",1140048000,11,1887,4.9904153354632586
348208,5,6301736303,"This classic film that was written and directed by George Waggner is an old fashioned ""GOOD STORY"" told and pictured in a manner of story telling that has become a ""LOST ART!""

348209,3,6301736303,"The inspired pairing of John Wayne and comedian Oliver Hardy, along with some memorable action sequences, elevate ""The Fighting Kentuckian"" (1949) to a higher level than most Republic Westerns. Wayne and Hardy work wonderfully together - it's markedly different from the Laurel and Hardy chemistry, but just as special. The only dead spot is a wooden and miscast Vera Hruba Ralston as Wayne's leading lady.",1102636800,,406,5.2615384615384615
348210,1,6301736303,"I'll admit, I'm not a big John Wayne fan. If you've seen one of his westerns, you've seen them all. I fell asleep TWICE when trying to watch this one. The only redeeming part was seeing Oliver Hardy trundling around in buckskins, doing pratfalls and slapstick. His lifelong comedy partner, Stan Laurel was too ill to take part, and I tend to think he became ill after looking at the script.",1081814400,,390,4.507042253521127
348211,3,6301736303,"A Kentucky soldier (John Wayne) falls for a French general's daughter (Vera Ralston) and gets mixed up in a battle between unscrupulous river traders and French settlers.  Nothing remarkable here.  It's pure formula right down to the end, when the cavalry comes to the rescue.  Oliver Hardy is entertaining in a rare appearance without Stan Laurel./",1060041600,4,349,5.196428571428571
348212,4,6301736303,"As another reviewer mentioned, the movie is a bit slow to start and leaves some plot points unexplained (yes, why *is* John Breen trying to get out of going with his regiment?) but is overall very enjoyable. Wayne is courtly and charming (nobody says ""ma'am"" like he does), and Oliver Hardy (showing off his native Georgian accent) is so adorable, I wanted to put him in my pocket. Truly an inspired piece of casting; thank goodness Wayne kept after Hardy when he initially refused to work without Stan Laurel. Vera Ralston as the French general's daughter was not the best choice, and I kept getting the two mustached villians mixed up, but I happily stayed with the movie until the ""big calvary rescue"" ending, and would watch it again. This DVD also includes some good behind the scenes photos, and plenty of interesting production notes.",1051228800,30,841,4.8068965517241375
348213,4,6301736303,"A very different John Wayne movie as he plays a member of a Kentuckey Milita regement who falls for a French General's daughter in 1818 Alabama.
The addition of Oliver Hardy as his side kick is a very neat trick and works extremely well in this picture.  I would have enjoyed seeing the paring more oftern.
The plot suffers as we never really know why he is avoiding his regement at the start but once we get up river it thickens and deepens to the point where we have quite a mystery on our hands, best exemplified when Wayne ask a character ""Who's side are you on anyway?"", and the answer comes ""Mine.""
Although some may disagree I think Vera Rawlson is very good in this picture and quite believeable, despite her being the studio heads girl (or maybe because of it, after all she plays the pampered daughter of a French General)
The big fight and chase scenes are pulled off well and the comic relief is pleasent.
An inexpensive movie and a pleasure.
And for those of you who scorn a colorized version, I don't know about you but my TV has a color control and you can turn it off.",1046995200,4,1084,4.3399014778325125
348214,3,6301736303,"""The Fighting Kentuckian"" is the second movie that The DUKE produced for Republic Pictures. Unfortunately, while the first project, ""Angel and the Badman"" was a great success, this movie bordered on disaster.
In order to be given producing credit, DUKE had to hire the studio boss's girlfriend (Vera Ralston), to star opposite him. He knew she'd be no good for the picture, but DUKE's hands were tied.
One problem with Vera Ralston was that she had a Czech accent. The role she was playing was supposed to be a French woman! In the end, all the French characters had to be cast with Czechs and other Eastern Europeans so Ralston's accent would not stand out. While not embarrassing herself too badly here, Ralston was not a real actress, and it shows.
Oliver Hardy is great as DUKE's sidekick, although he was reluctant to do a project without his partner, Stan Laurel. Hardy had worked in a play with DUKE and John Ford just before filming began on ""The Fighting Kentuckian"", and DUKE really wanted Hardy in his next project. Hardy only agreed after Laurel, ill at the time, talked him into it.
There's quite a bit that's out of place here. Mixing the Louisiana river traders with French Army ex-patriots is a weird bit of psudo-history, made even more weird by the unlikely addition of the Kentucky Regiment that Wayne and Hardy are part of.
DUKE is still DUKE, and Hardy is fun, but otherwise this overblown costume drama is not very memorable.
The print Artisan used for the DVD transfer is pretty poor, too. For DUKE or Hardy completists, only.",992908800,23,1549,4.719557195571956
348215,3,6301736303,"This historical action film is not remarkable for its drama. It's importance lies primarily in the somewhat serendipitous casting of perhaps the two most influential ""character"" actors in movie history:  John Wayne and Oliver Hardy.

The only obstacles in their way are her parents, a bunch of crooks, and the man shes expected to marry.  The story takes place in Alabama circa 1818.  It deals with French exiles thinking the land theyve built on belongs to them.  It doesnt, boundary stakes were purposely moved giving them the disadvantage.  People are willing to kill to keep this a secret until its time to move in on the poor unsuspecting Bonapartists.  Into this conflict stumble a Kentucky militiaman (Wayne) and his buddy Paine (Oliver Hardy).  With a lot of effort, they accidentally uncover the dastardly scheme.  Saving the girl and the land results in a dandy combat sequence.  Otherwise, a whole lot of wooing goes on and if not for the presence of Oliver Hardy, this might very well have become just another run-of-the-mill historical yawn.

348882,2,6301736303,"If you are a John Wayne fan, it is worth a look, and it was FREE so what the heck.  Also, a rare find is Oliver Hardy flying solo as comic relief; one of the very few roles he played without Stan Laurel.  While Wayne's role is ""typical hero"" for that period (boy meets a girl who belongs to somebody else, boy steals girls heart, and so-on), Hardy's role is not up to the quality he enjoyed during his renowned partnership with Laurel.

The cheesiest aspects of this film are:  During the first part of the film, the Kentuckians are marching out of town singing as they go.  Wayne and his new found love interest ride out of town in a carriage to the countryside.  They are intercepted and confronted by the girls fianc&eacute; and some other people.  Just when it looks like Wayne is going to get his ""come-up-ins"", we hear the Kentuckians singing, then we see them marching toward the spot thus preventing the ""come-up-ins"" and Wayne escapes. So, how did that happen?  the Army left town way before Wayne did.  Then again, at a critical point during some formal shindig, I'm guessing a day or so later, here come the Kentuckians again, singing the same dumb song.  Wayne is reunited with the chick and the boyfriend is slightly miffed, and free booze and eats sets the stage for a good old fashioned brawl.

Well, I don't want to spoil anything else, so like I said:  you are a John Wayne fan, you have to watch this because you are a John Wayne fan.  Overall this movie is bad enough to get a laugh or two--even if unintended.",1436918400,,1529,4.417857142857143

349543,3,6301736303,"The Fighting Kentuckian, 1949 film

This story is based on an historical fact. Frenchmen who supported Napoleon were exiled from France, Congress gave them land in Alabama as homes. The militia march through town (perhaps for the Creek War). They are dressed in buckskins, not military uniforms (more serviceable and cheaper). [The militia elected their officers.] John Breen is arrested for a bar fight (he supported Henry Clay). The militia arrived just in time, they march off singing. They present arms to a general of Napoleon. There is a wrestling contest for a gallon of Jamaican rum, and a free-for-all. A bugle ends the fighting. There is a song for entertainment. That night John Breen is advised to march away by a woman who is promised to another. Willy stays to watch John. [Note that old-fashioned bath tub!]

John rides to a mansion to see Mademoiselle, but she isn't home to him. He visits a tavern and learns how things are. Can he learn surveying quickly? [It is important to measure land accurately.] The singer tells her story and warns John about Hayden, the local powerful man. We learn about his scheme to grab developed land! Someone shoots at Breen as a threat and wounds him. Willy gives advice to John. They arrive at a party to play the fiddle. Is there a sour note? John gets a warning from Randolph and an offer to go away. The French General speaks to John Breen about his plans and the need for Blake Randolphs help. The French Colonel asks for their land to be surveyed to check the boundaries. John overhears a conversation and learns about the land fraud. But the arrival of bad guys ends the conversation. John tells the General about the fraud. Breen isn't a surveyor. Willy rides for help.

The arrival of the Colonel saves Breen. The man who talked too much learns of the danger. Breen meets Florette, she refuses him. Thats the way it is. The French gather at the Generals house. There is a shooting and a chase [for action]. [Note the modern tire tracks on a dirt road.] Blake Randolph is also jailed. Will he be shot while trying to escape? John races after Hayden. The river men plan to attack the French settlers, horsemen against riflemen. Kentuckians ride to the battle in wagons. The river men ride off in retreat. And so there is a happy ending. [But what happened next?]

This is a rare film because of the amount of comedy in what is a Western movie even if set east of the Mississippi. It is different from the usual movies that featured John Wayne, but not too different. The political climate was different too (the French settlers). [I didn't know that.] There is a lot of US history that is censored from the schoolbooks, you have to search for it. The traditional Western dealt with the conflicts between big ranchers and small ranchers or homesteaders. Sometimes sheepmen too. There was always a love story added to round out its appeal, and often young children as well",1396396800,,2927,4.666666666666667

349683,3,6301736303,"This is definitely not one of the Duke's better movies. It suffers from a poor script, mediocre direction and one of the most inept leading ladies in cinema history. It is saved by Wayne's presence, by the inspirational casting of Oliver Hardy as his sidekick, and by the presence of a truly fine actress, Marie Windsor, as a counterweight to Vera Ralston. Ralston was the lover and later wife of Republic studio head, Herbert Yates, who was 40 years her senior and who force fed her to Wayne in this movie and to other producers during her thankfully short career. She was nominated by the authors of the Golden Turkey Awards for the dubious honor of Worst Actress of All Time and you will see why after watching this movie. This is one of only three appearances Hardy made w/out his partner, Stan Laurel, and thankfully he has more screen time w/Wayne than Ralston does...those scenes and the scenes w/Wayne and Marie Windsor are the highlights of the film. If you can keep up w/the convoluted plot-line in this movie, you're a better cinemaphobe than I am; and if you can keep up with the dialogue of the Dutch and Czech actors without English subtitles or close captioning, your hearing is much more acute and discriminating than mine. You may also have trouble keeping the two mustachioed villains straight.

349691,5,6301736303,"Returning to Republic, for which he had made many B Westerns in his 20's, John Wayne produced this ""Eastern Western"" in his middle career, after his great success in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stagecoach/dp/6304696582/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stagecoach</a>.  The date is 1819, the place Mobile, Alabama, and he plays John Breen, a member of the Second Kentucky militia, which has spent the last five years fighting the Seminoles and Creeks and is now on its way home--on foot, because local riverboat magnate Blake Randolph (John Howard) won't let it ride his craft.  Sighting Fleurette deMarchand (Vera Ralston), whom he doesn't know is Randolph's fiancee, he falls in love, and she returns the sentiment.  10 days later the Second arrives at Demopolis, a settlement created by exiled officers of Napoleon's forces and headed up by Fleurette's father.  There Breen arranges to stay on, and soon discovers that all is not as peaceful as it seems.  George Hayden (Grant Withers), who controls the rivermen, is conspiring with Randolph to eject the French from the land they have improved, but Randolph, influenced by a genuine fondness for Fleurette, is having second thoughts.  One-armed Col. Georges Giraud (Philip Dorn), one of deMarchand's most trusted followers, has suspicions that something isn't right.  And Hayden's mistress Ann Logan (Marie Windsor) is out to get revenge for her former fiance, who she believes was murdered by Hayden.  To achieve this end she fools everyone into thinking that Breen and his sidekick, rotund bugler and packmaster Willie Paine (Oliver Hardy), are surveyors come to check out the French grant lines.  Now Breen and Willie must convince deMarchand that his people's titles are in danger--to say nothing of their lives.

Besides suspense, action, a generous sprinkling of humor, and an intriguing historical background (it isn't *exactly* accurate--look up ""Demopolis, Alabama"" on Wikipedia--but let's assume that this is a slightly alternative Universe), if you read the Production Notes included on the disc, you'll come away with an increased respect for Wayne as an actor.  Ralston (with whom he had worked four years earlier in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dakota/dp/B0000640U0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dakota</a>) was wished on him by her boyfriend, the head of Republic, who was determined to make a star of her, but she couldn't act and sometimes required as many as 15 takes to get a scene right.  Wayne not only conquers his natural dislike of such unprofessional behavior and makes a convincing lover of himself, he makes Ralston look good while he's at it.  This has been one of my favorites of the Duke's mid-career work ever since I discovered it on cable many years ago.  It's definitely worth a look.",1287360000,,2855,5.578703703703703
349762,4,6301736303,"[VHS]

Colorization really takes this 1949 semi-Classic up a notch. The cinematography, costuming, and general period detail are really enhanced by this process.

The respect and easy rapport between John Wayne, Oliver Hardy, and Vera Ralston, is obvious, as they all seem to be having a great time, in this interesting mix of soap opera and action.

A strong script, tight direction, and expert editing, really sell it. I found the historical references fascinating - actually learned a few things about how the ""East Was Won"".

A very engaging aspect is in the teaming of Duke and Ollie, two legendary icons, without a doubt: Wayne, the ultimate two fisted hero; Hardy, a member of the greatest comedy duo. They both do their thing - in fact, we get the sense that Hardy was encouraged to ad-lib, a rarity even in slapstick comedies! At age 57, and quite corpulent, he still moves gracefully, running, pratfalling, keeping up with the ""kids"".

Final battle on horses is a little long but very well shot - one of the most exciting you'll ever see - maybe *too* realistic, as I wondfder if some of the actors/stunt riders actually got hurt.

John Wayne represents the foot soldier in The Militia as it slogs its way between insurgencies and ""in-fighting"". Taking to a French general's daughter at the outset of the film, Wayne's character questions the intriguing & thieving land-owners, the theft of another man's land, local power struggles and general dishonesty. At the end of course the good wins over bad, Wayne's character wins the girl and all live happily ever after.

349767,4,6301736303,"John Wayne is well known for his westerns. The setting of this 1949 flick is Alabama, involving men who came from Kentucky. So this is technically an ""eastern"". The scenes are apt for the early 1800's: Soldiers are still using flintlocks, Alabama is about to be admitted to the Union as a state, and there is a large group of French citizens exiled after Napoleon's ignominious defeats.

John Breen (John Wayne) falls in love with a French woman. Trouble is, she is already earmarked for an arranged marriage to another man. A love triangle develops. Breen is determined to marry her. But he adds to the problems by pretending that he is a surveyor. He also finds out that there is a scheme afoot to defraud the French of some of their property by moving the posts that define the boundaries of the property.

This flick is more than a love story. It pushes the American way over the then-European way. The American way is progressive and the European way is traditional. In the American way, women marry whomever they love and whomever they choose to marry. In the then-European way, women married according to arranged marriages. These were usually based on social class, the wealth of the suitor, and the professional connections of the suitor with the father of the bride.

This isn't a western but should be listed as a pre-western (does this make it an ""eastern""?), along with the likes of ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" or ""Unconquered"". The casting of Oliver Hardy in one sense is a stretch but it's also brilliant. Vera Ralston is badly miscast. It's this casting of Ralston that led to some compromising of other roles. Her accent is NOT French so the other roles were cast with this in mind. It should be stated that the casting of Vera Ralston was forced upon Wayne by the studio.

7814400,5,6301736303,"Olive Films has done an outstanding job with their blu ray edition of John Wayne's 1949 romantic adventure The Fighting Kentuckian. This Republic Pictures film has its share of historic detail, and quite a bit of humor provided by Wayne's sidekick, the buckskin-clad Oliver Hardy. This was their only pairing and it is a real cinematic gem.

I own The Fighting Kentuckian in an Artisan/Lions Gate edition from 2007, so I decided to compare it with the Olive Films 2013 blu ray edition.  The blu ray is far superior. The picture quality in the Artisan DVD is dark, muddy, and with fuzzy focus.  While the blu ray edition has a picture that is  very sharp and clear.  And the sound is strong and steady in both editions.

Legendary movie bad girl Marie Windsor appears in The Fighting Kentuckian, and she said in an interview years later that she had a great time during the making of the film.  She said Oliver Hardy was a ""sweet gentleman"" who enjoyed chitchating with the cast and crew.  She also said John Wayne was a lot of fun to work with and that everyone on the set, both cast and crew, were his friends and were loyal to him.

The story takes place in Alabama in 1815.  John Wayne as John Breen and his pal Oliver Hardy as Willie Payne are members of a large group of Kentuckians who have been fighting with General Andrew Jackson and contributed to the American victory at the Battle of New Orleans.

Now the Kentuckians are walking home to Kentucky, when Wayne meets the daughter of a French officer in Mobile. A group of French exiles who had fought with Napoleon were now in Alabama to both create a new settlement and start a new life in America.

The plot is multilayered, and Wayne's objectives were to help the French people in the area to legally retain the land they now live on, and to win the hand of the beautiful young French woman.

In the meantime, Oliver Hardy provides a stellar performance that makes one wonder what would have happened if he had been teamed with his friend John Wayne in other films.  But at least we have this one memorable film to see these two great actors interacting with each other.

The film also stars the lovely and somewhat underrated actress Vera Ralston who, as a Czech figure stater in the 1936 Olympics, insulted Adolph Hitler to his face.  She then managed to escape with her mother to the United States in the early days of World War II, and lived to tell the tale.

All in all, this blu ray edition of The Fighting Kentuckian by Olive Films is well worth viewing and adding to any film collection.",1507507200,4,2559,4.49244060475162
