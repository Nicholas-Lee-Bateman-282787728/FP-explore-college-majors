676461,5,6303443109,"This directorial debut for cinematographer Yves Angelo who shot  Claude Berri's Germinal and Alain Corneau's Tous Les Matins du Monde is an exciting achievement, visually ravishing. This is a beautiful realisation of the Honore de Balzac story of a soldier thought to have been killed in the 1807 Battle of Eylau, who returns to Paris to reclaim his name and fortune from his now remarried wife. The similarity to The Return of Martin Guerre is drawn because of the casting of Gerard Depardieu as the soldier, but the identity of Chabert is never challenged. Angelo includes footage of the battle using a blue filter and we see the obscenity of war by the burning of a dead horse, and the nobility of of a charge via the thudding of hooves on snow. When human bodies are piled to be buried the mud makes the image sculptural. These sequences are brief flashbacks but they, and the training camp where Chabert resides with white bears during negotiations for his claim, help us to understand his character. The film is well-paced, with scenes timed at just the right speed to allow an audience to appreciate the intricacies of the tale unfolding. Of note are the editing of a pre-bed servant ritual which is carried out, without fuss, under a conversation, and Depardieu finding eggs in a birds nest signalling the appearance of his former wife's children. Since the screenplay is based on a novel, part of the pleasure to be had is in the richness of the language, delivered by 3 superb actors. Chabert is a wounded character and Depardieu hides him under a large hat, reminiscent of a fop and The Cat in the Hat. If Depardieu is not as memorable as he has been in other roles it's probably because  here he defers his scenes to Fabrice Luchini as his lawyer and Fanny Ardant as his former wife. Luchini is the mediator between the two and while his words may soothe, his eyes are daggers. Ardant at times resembles Ingrid Bergman and she isn't afraid to show how manipulative her character is. Her love for Chabert is explicably entangled with his money and her soft dresses, bonnets and ribbons hide a viper. A special nod to the costume designer Franca Squarciapino, and to Angelo's discreet use of classical music.",992736000,13,2218,4.713917525773196
676462,4,6303443109,"A really good movie. The director follows the time period fairly well in terms of props and constumes. Acting is top-notch, but that's expected when you look at the cast. There are several scenes where I was blown away by the powerfull cinematography. I think that the director wielded great power to impact the audience's emotions but he just didn't use it to the fullest extent. Also, I felt like characters were definetely under-developed, except maybe for Mr. Derville. Overall, an amazing movie with extremely moving scenes but not enough character development; great potential that just wasn't used.",971308800,,605,5.183673469387755
676463,3,6303443109,"The actors are definitely talented, especially Gerard Depardieu, a real favorite of mine.  Fanny Ardant did a fine job protraying his former wife.  And their attorney (Fabrice Luchini) was probably the most convincing  character of all -- and as conniving at the Colonel and the Countess  themselves.  The costumes and settings are also generally very well-done.  However, in my book, these positives don't quite overcome the shortcomings  that Amazon's critic accurately characterized as plodding and uneven.  Unfortunately, the characters are not developed enough to hold my interest  at the slow pace of the film. Relying on subtitles does not help this fact;  perhaps if I understood French, the nuances of the dialog that are lost in  subtitles would perk it up.  It has lots of surface emotion, but not  sufficient depth.  Not bad, but certainly not great -- and I am a fan of  period films.",961891200,,897,5.0479452054794525
676464,4,6303443109,"Colonel Chabert (French with English subtitles) This story of a hero of the Napoleanic wars, presumed dead, is deliberately slow-moving so it can characterize the deathly slow dirge of time when you've lost everything.  The Colonel has been in and out of madhouses for ten years, and  continuously rejected by his wife who has since remarried and enjoyed the  high lifestyle he left her with.  A terrifying look at identity and  humanity's colder side.  A very interesting film, based on a novel by  Balzac.",957398400,6,507,4.964285714285714
7849732,5,6303443109,"I have always loved this movie - it is rendered and feels to me as though I were actually leafing through the Balzac volume.  Depardieu is wonderful, Ardant beautiful, and Luchini is fantastic.  Highly recommended.  However, a tad difficult to find for U.S. machines.",1442275200,,267,5.0227272727272725

7849734,2,6303443109,"A disturbing story of a man who gives up what's rightfully his.

A common theme of the 19th century was the nobility of ""Christian"" self-sacrifice. In the present case, the beneficiary of the self-sacrifice is a woman totally unworthy of the sacrifice. I can't say that this interpretation of morality makes sense to me.",1408320000,,320,4.925925925925926

7849736,4,6303443109,"Another story based on a novel...a very pretty 'period' piece.  Fanny Ardant is as cold and sexy as usual, Gerard is
perfect in his role, as usual!!!!",1354665600,,150,4.555555555555555
7849737,5,6303443109,"For once the lawyer(played by Fabrice Luchini) is decent and the hero. I first saw it in 1994 & was surprised/delighted to be able to get it thru Amazon. I have seen a lot of French movies & this is easily one the best. A classic. All about a man , magnificently played by Grard Depardieu, regaining his dignity.",1344211200,4,312,4.305084745762712
7849738,4,6303443109,"Wonderfully acted by Gerard Depardieu and Fanny Ardant, and beautifully
shot.

A man re-emerges 10 years after being declared dead in the Napoleonic
wars. He wants something, but even HE doesn't seem sure what - his
money his wife kept, and brought to her new marriage? Revenge on her
for forgetting him? To win her back?

Meanwhile, her own lawyer also takes on Chabert's side of the case,
trying to broker a compromise, before word leaks out and all involved
are ruined in scandal. (Fabrice Luchini is great as the lawyer who's
motives are always a little mysterious).

An interesting, subtle study of what's really of value in life.

My only complaint is that some of the Machiavellian machinations are a
little obviously played by both Ardant's character and her greedy,
wormy new husband, who values a peerage over marriage, love or family.
Somehow that artifice made the film a bit less emotionally powerful
than it might be. But I'd gladly see it again.",1291852800,,960,4.835365853658536
7849739,5,6303443109,"Honoree de Balzac's novels are known for their callous and cool characters of 19th Century France. Anne Chabert has moved on and remarried now that her Colonel/husband has been dead these past ten years. Enter The Colonel,ready to reclaim his name,his wife,his fortune only to be shunned and blocked at all turns. Fanny Ardent and Gerard Depardieu are no strangers to the acting in adaptations of Balzac's works. They succeed on all levels as two of the best French actors ever to grace the screen. The excellent companion film to COLONEL CHABERT would be BALZAC,again featuring Ardent and Depardieu,as well as COUSIN BETTE, another Balzac adaptation. THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE(also starring Depardieu) and it's American remake SOMMERSBY also contain the similar themes of lost identity.",1172016000,3,789,5.26984126984127
7849740,2,6303443109,"Although a fan of French films and historical realism, I was disappointed with this particular work.  The film is not terribly advanced; it's themes are simple and portrayed well, but not excellently.  The characters are somewhat realistic, but not developed well, and most are not likeable, even when they should be.  Moreover, the film is boring; it takes a lot of time to relate even a little bit of not so interesting information.  The ending, meanwhile, is anti-climatic and not totally unexpected.  The average viewer will watch with a cold detachment, at best.  Overall, not a bad film to watch if you've absolutely nothing better to do, but there are much better French films out there.",1125100800,2,694,4.939655172413793
7849741,5,6303443109,"Yves Angelo's adaptation of Balzac's classic short story is a moving work in which the direction, cinematography and acting all excel in manifesting Honore de Balzac's moving exploration of the human condition.

 The morbid opening scene of the aftermath of Napoleon's phyrric victory at Eylau is accentuated by haunting melody of Beethoven's ""Ghost"" trio: a recurring thematic image througout the film. One truly feels how vanquished and disillusioned the colonel must have felt in seeing himself among the piles of corpses on the frigid battlefield. All the colonel wants is to be reunited with his identity that his heartless wife has denied him for the past decade. The colonel himself is a ghost among the living; a man with only a past but no future: a man whose sense of self died along with the ambitions of the Napoleanic reign. His wife wants only the lavish life which he had made available to her but not his person; his ""death"" ensures and continues her prosperous life. The movie truly captures the deep character study typical of Honore de Balzac's works.

 Altogether a brilliant film with great direction and powerful acting. I hope the film will soon be released on DVD.",1091059200,8,1188,4.925
