Rollerbabies wasn't as much about skating as I thought but still great flick. All 3 movies have what you are looking for lots of babes naked.",1389052800,6,280,4.62
8447697,3,B004XZ99Y6,"Teenage Twins (Carter Stevens, 1976)

Ah, the wild frontier of porn, back when nothing was taboo and the more outrageous your gimmick, the more you could draw at the box office. Teenage Twins has what may be the most outrageous gimmick ever, and my jaw still drops every time I even think of this flick. There are very few porn movies I can watch all the way through, but this is the kind of thing that once you stop watching, you just can't turn away for the sheer wonderment of it all. Even more interesting, writer Al Hazrad actually attempted to build a story here, and man, is it a weird one.

The film stars Brooke and Taylor Young, a pair of identical twins, as Hope and Prudence, two sisters who share a mystical bond that allows either to feel what the other feels. (One or the other of them is usually having sex, and yes, sometimes that happens with each other--imagine seeing that in an American porn film made after 1980!) Because of this bond, a professor (Eric Edwards) thinks he can use the twins in a ritual to... well, does it really matter? All you need to know is that this ritual involves lots of naked flesh.

Don't get me wrong. There is no technical way in which Teenage Twins is a good movie. If you're seeking something like this out, it's for the prurient interest of seeing actual honest-to-[entire phrase censored for Amazon consumption] captured on film. Stevens, towards the beginning of his twenty-five-year career as a porn director, tabbed Hazrad to write a weird script (the first of the four collaborations between the two men), and Hazrad certainly came through here. Have yourself a weird time; you won't believe what you're seeing. ***",1246147200,,1674,4.62962962962963
8447698,4,B004XZ99Y6,"This is xxx so it is not for the feint of heart.  There are a number of reviews that go into great detail so I will not.

If you enjoy erotic movies, this one is great.  The clothes are silly but back then we all wore them.  The twins are sexy and looked like they really enjoyed what they were doing.

If you like xxx, I would reccommend this movie, however to enjoy it, treat it like hardcore camp.",1198195200,7,400,4.012658227848101
8447699,4,B004XZ99Y6,"Three cheers to Amazon. I was amazed to find this title available here. This is not softcore erotica. It is classic XXX porn from the mid-1970s. It is hilarious, both intentionally and unintentionally.

Its main claim to fame - it boasts the first instance of identical twins starring in a porno. The plot is pretty silly. Two horny sisters - Hope, the brazen slut, and Prudence, the ""virgin harlot"" (only in secret and only through the backdoor), live with their Mum and Stepdad. Their stepfather dabbles in the occult and is translating the ""Necronomicon"" to learn the secret of eternal life. Apparently, to gain eternal life, you need to perform a Black Mass and ""sacrifice"" a ""virgin harlot"". The plot is just an excuse to engage in various combinations of sex. I loved the ending - after their Black Mass orgy, they discover that they haven't attained eternal life at all but eternal horniness instead.  ;-)

Here's a blow by blow of the sex scenes. First, Prudence the ""virgin harlot"" has a solo with a black leather bible (used as a sex-toy). Then the twins come together for a lesbian-69. Next their mother (Porn Queen Georgina Spelvin from The Devil in Miss Jones) does it on the couch with Daddy's pal. The horny pair get caught by Hope, the naughty twin, who naturally joins in. The next scene has Prudence doing it doggy-style with stepdad - backdoor only so that she can remain a virgin. Hope meanwhile gets a rugjob from Prudy's boyfriend. Then Hope has a threesome with stepdad and his pal - DPs in all positions. Then everyone comes together for the grand finale - a pentagonal-f___ - five participants with one very willing victim doing it over a Satanic pentagram. Lots of BJs, c__shots and penetrations all round. Totally depraved and thoroughly enjoyable.

Only drawback. This film was shot on what looks like 16mm film. Picture quality is mediocre at best. It has not been restored. There are numerous artifacts - specks and flecks galore. In one scene it looks like it's raining in the bedroom. Worse, in the final 20 seconds, when they are discussing the results of their failed Black Mass, the audio goes missing. Still it's a very enjoyable 68mins. At $10, definitely worth the price. At the very least give it a rental. Sadly you don't see porn like this being made anymore. Oh for the good old days.",1196553600,39,2326,4.721674876847291
8447700,1,B004XZ99Y6,"This is a movie that was ill conceived and in my opinion should never have been made. If I could have rated it with negative stars, it would have gotten a -5. First, in the very first sex scene, one of the twins masturbates with a Bible. As soon as I saw were that was going, I jumped to next chapter ( only a few seconds into the scene). At the last chapter, I ended it after only a minute or two. They had one of the twins splayed out on the floor over a Pentagram, and the whole cast was present. You can figure the rest as I did. Anyway, after viewing approximately 15-20 mins. of this trash, I took out the DVD and will probably try and shred it. I would not want to subject anyone else to this junk. That having been said, I am not adverse to explicit sex in movies. I own 9 Songs, and thought that was a fairly well made movie. I have several others that feature explicit sex, some good, and some I wish I had not gotten as they were pretty shallow as far as story content went. This film is nothing more than utter trash and should be avoided at all costs. Charlie S.",1196121600,4,1075,4.02803738317757
8447701,3,B004XZ99Y6,"Well, what can you say? A brilliant film deserving of multiple Academy Awards?  No,it is what it is, and if you've read the product description, you pretty much know all that you need to know. However, I'll add this. The DVD is high quality, and much better than the VHS tapes that preceded it, and the film is intact, in all it's XXX glory. Porn changed dramatically in the 1980s, with the ascendence of professionally-produced films featuring performers of spectacular physiognomy. But spectacular is unreal, and the eroticism of 60s/70s productions was lost, probably helping to fuel the explosion of amateur porn (it's simply less predictable and more varied). Teenage Twins was a significant, if not particularly adept, work from the Golden Age of erotica; if you're a fan of that, you'll probably like this.",1193270400,48,813,5.022222222222222
