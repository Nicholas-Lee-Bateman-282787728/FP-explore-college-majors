8238728,4,B0010VSYOW,"The package arrived quickly, coming USPS Priority mail.  The package was a plastic wrapping not a box. Also included was a booklet of other videos available from the company.

The DVD was in a printed cardboard-type case.  Not your standard plastic dvd/bluray style case.  The front just says ""military videos"" or something similar (should have wrote the review before I wrapped it up as a present because now I forget) so I assume they use the same case for most/all their videos.  It just flips open and the DVD is held in place by a small circular piece of foam glued inside the case that fits inside the center hole of the DVD.

The DVD itself has a professional-looking printed label that simply says Huey Helicopter.  Flipping it over you get the blue-ish look of a computer-burned DVDr.

I decided to test it before wrapping it up as a gift to make sure it plays.  There is no menu, simply an opening screen logo, the standard piracy warnings, a title screen of ""Traditions Military Video"" then it cuts right into the film.  No chapter selections or play features, at least not on my computer.

There is no break between the four different films included on the DVD.  One simply ends and it cuts right into the next.  That would be my only real complaint, it would have been nice to have been able to select which Huey video I wanted to see.

The footage is as you would expect, old military training footage.  I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my father who was a Huey crew chief in the Army from '73 to '77 and is absolutely in love with all things Huey.  I can't speak to how much ""detail"" they go into it, I simply checked to make sure all the advertised videos were there and then wrapped it up and put it under the tree.  Based on what I saw this would make a very nice gift for the passionate Huey lover.",1324080000,,1825,4.383928571428571
