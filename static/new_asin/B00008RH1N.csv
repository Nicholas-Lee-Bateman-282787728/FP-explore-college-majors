8007890,5,B00008RH1N,"In my opinion, this is one of the best made martial arts movies! It features all the best Kung Fu practioners in China--everyone is a prominent figure in his/her own styles. Plus it is a pretty accurate documentary/historical movie!",1181952000,,232,4.9743589743589745
8007891,1,B00008RH1N,"If you are into political movie and don't care about seeing lot of action, then this is a perfect movie for you.  Even when you see some action, they are not very impressive at all, except for the part where a young female asks two guys to teach their kung fu techniques, but you only see this section very briefly.  Most of the time, all the characters do in this film was talk, talk, talk, and then talk stragies some more.  I don't even think at the end of this film, you get to find out whether or not they actually did freee the prince and the prisoner.  Just an afully boring film.",1130025600,,587,4.168141592920354
