8582495,5,B00CJFYI0C,I love all 6 seasons. You can learn so much from this series. You feel like you've been to other countries.,1432944000,,107,4.142857142857143
8582496,5,B00CJFYI0C,Great 70s show would not be as good without Nimoy. Early precursor to Monster Quest. It has held up well.,1399507200,2,105,4.3
8582497,4,B00CJFYI0C,"This classic TV series starred Leonard Nemoy (Spock) and was very interesting, as I was growing up. Certain episodes, such as the Titanic, have their information obviously outdated, as this was made prior to the wreck's discovery.  The episode on Houdini was excellent, but others, left a lot to be desired by an adult.  A good trip down memory lane.",1396915200,3,350,4.816666666666666
