In this line, his work is much biassed and lacks impartiality. No serious, but pamphletary films",1452643200,,244,4.444444444444445
8727010,5,B013702O1C,"If you care about documentary films, the world around us, history, Chile, cinema, people, - well you get the picture - the work of Patricio Guzman is not to be missed, and this package of films he made from 1973 to the present day is pretty amazing. And the film about Guzman is good too and very informative. Highly recommended.",1443830400,20,329,4.5
