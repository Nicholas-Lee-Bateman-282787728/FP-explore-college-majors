8543945,5,B009RWP9FI,I love these guys. A really small venue but a perfect performance. It is hard to describe their music but a cross between porcupine tree and dream theater. One of my favorite albums of all time from sieges even is art of navigating by the stars. Subsignal carries on this style with some heavy but melodic songs. Give it a spin/view and you will not be disappointed.,1386892800,,366,4.477611940298507
8543946,5,B009RWP9FI,"Last night I had the GREAT PLEASURE to watch the new Subsignal DVD ""Out There Must Be Something"" thanks to a friend! I purchased a copy about a month ago and for some strange reason it would not work on my DVD player. According to Amazon.com it is supposed to play in the USA and Canada, but it did not work. Apparently I was not the only one who had a problem with it over in the States. Some had problems, others did not, mostly due to how old the player is (mine was purchased in 2007). Strange, it would play on players purchased since 2010, but not on players before that. My friend really helped me out by making a copy (only in this situation) that worked on one of his DVD players and mailed me a copy that would play on my player. Just let me say that it was VERY GREATLY APPRECIATED as Subsignal are a favorite band of mine and I decided to keep the original in case I update my player in the coming years. They have such brilliant songwriting skills and great musical talent. I love the arrangements of their songs and the lyrics are very special to me. I finally got the chance to see and hear Arno Menses sing and perform and I was not disappointed, and Markus Steffan, the guitarist, plays with great melodic skills. They play in a wide range from very heavy to very soft, displaying wonderful harmonies and background vocals as well. Their last two albums ""Beautiful and Monstrous"" and ""Touchstones"" are albums that really touched me and impressed me with their originality. A great live concert recorded over in Germany in a small club in front of a very small audience. That is my only complaint, is that these guys should really be more well known, and it was a little sad to see such great talent getting such a light response to their music. My other complaint was the audience participation was weak and VERY off-key. But other than that minor stuff, it was just so amazing to see them perform. Forever grateful to the band for recording this DVD and my friend for making it possible for me to see it. Still hoping that Subsignal will one day soon begin to start making a name for themselves to a greater degree over here in the USA. They will be releasing a new album in the fall, and I will be looking forward to it! (Just a note: I always purchase my copies as I prefer to support the artist and their talents, and I recommend others do the same. I only accept copies if there are difficulties and there is no other way to own it.)",1367107200,4,2455,4.327548806941432
8543947,5,B009RWP9FI,"Filmed in a small club in Mannheim, Germany, Subsignal (former members of Sieges Even and Dreamscape) show the world exactly why they are one of the most artistic, innovative and fresh Progressive Rock groups of today.  From the classical inspired melodies and riffs of Markus Steffen to the majestic voice of Arno Menses, Subsignal is a rare musical prize in a sea of fools gold (IOW- mainstream bubblegum crap).

Fans of Subsignal and Progressive Music will appreciate the clean production, sound, setlist and that ""small club live atmosphere"" that captures the essense and heart of a Subsignal live show.  Arno's voice is flawless, Markus' guitar sounds clean and the riffs rock while Ralf thunders his bass to perfection and David creates the perfect moods and background with his masterful skills at keyboard.  Newcomer Danilo Batdorf (Dreamscape) fills in nicely for Roel van Helden (who left the band shortly before this show) and never misses a beat and his contributions on the next CD will be most welcome.  A very attractive and talented Julie Astra special guests on background vocals and shares the lead with Arno on the Duet ""The Lifespan of a Glimpse"" which is one of the highlights.

One of the things that makes Subsignal stand out is their connection to their fans and Arno pays special attention to get the crowd involved and even goes into the crowd at one point to allow fans to sing along with him (to the classic Sieges Even ballad ""Eyes Wide Open"").  It is this spirit of inclusion and passion that the band shares with its fans that help make them so unique and special gift to the music world.

For all Progressive Rock fans spanning from Saga to Kansas, from Yes to Asia as well as all who fancy melodic rock, do yourself a favor and get their CDs and grab this live DVD and then experience them live for yourself if you have the possibility....they are truly special and deserve to be heard outside of Germany!

For me, this is the music DVD of 2012/2013 and I cant wait to see them live (again) but hope they make it to the USA.  I hope many of you give them a chance, spread the word and lets bring them here to the USA to perform for us live ASAP......but until that moment, this awesome DVD will fill that gap!  Enjoy!",1357084800,7,2250,4.614035087719298
