6244849,5,B00I095LMU,"Yes, I love the music of Moby, one of the best/greatest artists. So when I saw that he was going to play 'around the corner' here in LA, I bought immediately two VIP tickets. Shaking hands with him, staying in the front row of this concert (YES!), listening to this great musician.

Something like 3 hours of the best music that there is, and then life !

So no doubt that I can say that this is one of the best DVDs that I've.

When you're a moby fan, and wasn't able to join the concert, go for it!
- Crisp and clear music, as at the event
- Good presentation of the visual effects as they were on stage
- Put it on your big screen, open a bottle of wine, switch of the lights, and enjoy a couple of hours of great music !

Only question I still have: is they keyboard player playing life or not, for sure the others are!

And when you are aware of another great Moby event around LA, please invite me ;-)

6244850,1,B00I095LMU,"This is a difficult review, as the show is great, but the actual 2xDVD+2xCD has a production fault, which is why I have rated this title low. Both my DVD's were mismatched. The actual full live show is on the Bonus DVD and the Bonus DVD content is on the DVD marked ""full show"". Not the end of the world, but a really bad manufacturing error.
I also wish the full show was on the CD's as some tracks were cut (most likely due to space limitations).",1393718400,,448,4.160919540229885
6244851,5,B00I095LMU,"Let me preface my review by providing a bit of info regarding the recording that makes this DVD/CD set. In October 2013, Moby put on 3 concerts at the Fonda Theater in Los Angeles. This would be his only tour for the new album Innocents. The only other way you could view the concert was to watch it live streaming online for a limited time.

I was fortunate enough to purchase tickets for the ""Thursday night"" show with balcony seats. After the concert, I managed to get another ticket to the next night's show where I experienced the concert at the very front not 10 feet from stage. Seeing it from the balcony let me appreciate the crazy visuals of the lighting while being up front the next night left me speechless. This review is not a review of the DVD/CD set (as of this writing it has not been released yet). However, as someone who attended the concert where the filming/recording took place (twice), I can honestly say you're in for a real treat.

If you're considering purchasing this, then i'm pretty sure you already have the Innocents album. The first half of this 3 hour concert is of Moby, his band and special guest performers covering the entire Innocents album.

If you don't have the Innocents album (I highly recommend you stop reading and cue it up on spotifylastfmpandoraitunes right now and give it a listen) but like some of Moby's ""other stuff"" then you're in for a real treat as well. The second half of his concert is essentially a ""best of"" from just about every album he's released.  I myself own pretty much every album he's released (including the b sides) and I think his concert is a pretty good setlist of what's made him such a prolific artist.

OK, so if you own more than 2 Moby albums, this DVD is a must buy. That's pretty clear. What about the more casual fans who may only know Moby from ""that song from that Leonardi Dicaprio movie"" (Porcelain)."" Or perhaps you only recognize Moby as ""that techno music dj guy who got in a tiff with Eminem"". Well my friend, even YOU are in for a treat.

My wife actually attended one of the concerts with me, going into it with not knowing much about Moby's music. Coming out she admitted it was one of the best concerts she's ever experienced. And she's not even a fan of the guy!

What will be a pleasant surprise to many is that live instruments were used throughout the show with Moby himself on vocals, guitar and even drums at times. He's accompanied by a choir, strings, drums, bass etc and an epic lineup of guest vocalists.

For me, Moby's music has always hit me in a certain, intimate way that most other music doesn't come close to. I recall listening to ""Slipping Away"" all the time when my grandfather passed away 8-9 years ago. To my surprise, Moby played a haunting acoustic version of this song during the concert. His music has a connection that words can't do justice. I'm looking forward to listening to the 2 CDs of this concert's performances.

On a side note, hopefully this DVD will contain some of the outtakes of Moby speaking to the audience in between songs. His banter seemed genuine and you get the feeling that Moby is a pretty easy going guy any of us could walk right up and talk to. That alone, to me is worth spending a few bucks and supporting an artist by buying a DVD.

OK, enough ranting. Because Moby has no plans on going on tour for the Innocents album, this DVD is going to be a MUST BUY. This performance is something you will not want to miss. A truly amazing experience for everyone.

Update 3/2/14
Quick update. I guess folks who pre-ordered got their copies a couple of days in advance (woohoo!). I've finished watching the concert DVD. It really does a fantastic job of capturing the evening. I've just started watching the extra DVD. Lots of cool stuff including the making of and tutorials. Haven't yet listened to the CDs yet.

OK, yes it's true. There is a printing error on the 2 DVDs. The artwork on disc 2 is actually disc 1 and vice versa. Contrary to other reviewers, I really don't think it's a big deal. S*** happens. Both discs play fine. In fact, I think it's sort of a collectors item having it produced this way.

Again, I can't recommend this purchase enough. 2 DVDs and 2 CDs for under $25. Wow. If you're reading this Moby, thank you thank you thank you.",1391212800,21,4300,4.455470737913486
6244852,4,B00I095LMU,"It's really too bad that Moby didn't take this tour all over the world because it's a treat.  The only thing I have to complain about - and  this has always bugged me about Moby - is his penchant to unleash a stream of annoying ""Thankyou's"" after each song.  It's fricken irritating as h*ll.  So much so that I r****d the discs, and used an audio app to clip out the d**m thankyou's.  Now the concert is perfect.",1406073600,,412,4.230769230769231
6244853,5,B00I095LMU,"Truth be told, had I never known that Moby was vegan, I probably wouldn't have heard one song from him. Once it was disclosed that he lives a compassionate lifestyle, it was important to follow his work to get an understanding of his philosophy and creativity. I'm not only glad that I found his work but am doubly happy supporting his projects with a clear conscience knowing that he doesn't support animal abuse in any form.",1403827200,,426,4.618421052631579
6244854,4,B00I095LMU,"The dvds are great (though the labels are wrong, as seems to be the common case) HOWEVER, the cd's need some editing, since Moby keept ALL the small talk between songs, and what he says is pretty repetitive. The bloodiest example is when he decides to take a picture of the audience and that takes him almost TWO minutes! It's ok to watch that on the dvd, but WHY KEEP THAT ON THE CD??!!
There are 4 (great) songs on the dvd that are not featured on the cd's. With some editing of the talking there would have been room for some of them for sure.",1402272000,,546,4.160377358490566
6244855,4,B00I095LMU,"I was there so I'm a little biased but for my gf it was her first Moby show and she admitted it was one of the best she's ever seen. The playlist is second to none for the artist. Moby assembled an amazing backing band and singers. Sometimes there would be up to 14 complimentary musicians. The show is broken up into a performance of his new Innocents album with several guests. The second half is a fan voted ""best of"" playlist.
The sound quality and camera work are pretty good. Not great. You're buying this set for the song selection, overall musicianship and amazing energy. The big issue is just like other people have mentioned the labeling of the DVD and CD are reversed. While it's unprofessional it no means ruins the set. You just have to remember that both discs are reversed.",1400457600,2,789,4.486111111111111
6244856,5,B00I095LMU,As usual Moby shows the breadth of his musical styles and his song writing capability. Brilliant quality and support for other great artists.,1398556800,,141,5.173913043478261
6244857,5,B00I095LMU,"I have to be honest I wasn't wild about Moby's last studio album, but this live recording on of only 3 nights on his last tour brings the work to life and the second disk of Moby's more popular favorites are both winners.  The DVD's are of the show and a disk of videos and extras.  This is a very good set.  Worthy of a new comer to Moby and old seasoned vets as well.",1396742400,,369,3.8933333333333335
6244858,5,B00I095LMU,"I was at one of the concerts and it was fabulous in person. The DVD is a great representation of the show.

6244859,5,B00I095LMU,"Was at this concert, front and center , and it was amazing! The CD and DVD captures the energy of the night... However, the DVD is mislabeled, Disc 2 actually has content of Disc 1. Just wondered if they are all mislabeled or just mine?",1396051200,,236,4.266666666666667
6244860,4,B00I095LMU,"Mine had the 2 DVDs with the artwork switched to the wrong discs (artwork of disc One printed on disc Two and vice versa). Not a problem as all the content is included , just a moment of confusion 'till I realized the error.

 As for the music , I liked the DVD show better than the audio CD version. Same music on both media but the visual aspect of the DVD makes it more enjoyable.

 Recommended.",1395878400,,398,4.12987012987013
6244861,5,B00I095LMU,"Top notch performance from Moby and friends, captured beautifully with an impressive visual aesthetic provided by the lighting and the many musicians on stage with him. This is by far his longest and most career spanning live release to date, and covers everything from his first single to his latest album. Even if you don't like Innocents at all, which is performed here in it's near entirety, there are still SEVENTEEN songs from previous albums that make up a ""greatest hits"" type set, so don't pass this one up by thinking it only caters to his latest record. I always thought Hotel Tour 2005 would be the be all end all of Moby DVDs, but this probably surpasses it. It's essential for any Moby fan, new or old. Worth every cent!
Yes there is a slight production error with the packaging and the discs, but do NOT let this deter you in any way.",1394841600,,849,4.51948051948052
