8150000,1,B000JCDTZC,Should have heeded other reviews.  This is not a good one.,1422662400,,58,4.2727272727272725
8150001,5,B000JCDTZC,"Nice therapy for overcoming and preventing injuries and also to feel loose, relaxed and alive.",1280707200,3,94,5.333333333333333

8150003,1,B000JCDTZC,"I bought the book Stretch to Win first and then bought the video in hopes that the video would fill in the gaps in the book. It does not. The video doesn't offer any new information. The gap is that the book is supposed to give you the keys to developing your own sport specific program. There is a section in the book that details what different sports need in terms of types of stretches. There is another section that lists stretches, but there is no section that explains what stretches belong to what categories. The DVD just shows the ""sample"" stretch routines being done. There is a football player, a baseball player and a golfer showing stretches that they do. And a girl who demonstrates some specific stretches. The DVD is touted as giving you the ability to print off workouts. This is just a PDF file that again just replicates sections out of the book. I would strongly encourage others to look elsewhere.",1212710400,13,919,4.575757575757576
8150004,5,B000JCDTZC,This DVD provides a good visual introduction to the concepts introduce in the book Stretch to Win. Subtle aspects of the stretching method are much easier to pick up via video. Well worth the money.,1201478400,9,198,4.685714285714286
