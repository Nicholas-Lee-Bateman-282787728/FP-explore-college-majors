7828503,4,6302642531,"Episodes on this VHS are.
1. Muppet Babies: the Next Generation
PLOT: Rowlf's refusal to take a bath leads the babies on a journey through pop culture. I laugh out loud at this one because of the Jetsons theme and the singing car.
2. Beauty and the Schnoz
PLOT: The babies try to teach Piggy to find the real beauty in something even if the outside is not so pretty.
Great educational values and wonderful story plots.",1453420800,,418,4.441558441558442
