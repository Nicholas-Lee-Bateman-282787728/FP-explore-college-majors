2875958,4,B000RXVNCE,"Grab that popcorn kiddies and light up that smoke coz we gonna enjoy another fun Midnite Movies Double Feature.  Usually with these discs, they try to choose two films with at least a similar theme, but these two are quite different from one another.  First on the bill, Chosen Survivors, is a very fun little piece of early seventies drive-in nonsense.  It deals with a group of humans hand picked to live in an underground facility in the event of a worldwide war or catastrophe.  The idea is to preserve the human race, but you'd think if this was the last hope for humanity, they'd at least pick some hotter chicks(going with Dr. Strangelove's theory) and people who could respond to stress and pressure better.  The facility is damn near perfect in every way except the damn bats who have somehow crept in.  The survivors have to deal with a swarm of hungry vampire bats that begin to pick them off.  Hey, at least it breaks up the boredom.  It stars B 70s sci-fi regular Bradford Dillman.  We also got Jackie Cooper, who you may remember as Mr. White from the Superman movies.  And lets not forget everyone's favorite character actor Richard Jaeckel, who you may remember from The Dirty Dozen and everyone's favorite, The Green Slime.  Fun movie and a good time.
Th Earth Dies Screaming tells the tale of a small group of survivors in England(I guess there actually is a bit of a theme here) who band together to fight an alien invasion.  The invaders take the form of big clunky robots that electrocute you to death if they touch you.  The robots are merely tools of the real aliens who we never see.  If that's the biggest threat to Earth, we shouldn't be worried since the robots are extremely slow, clumsy and seemingly blind.  A toddler would have no problem escaping these things.  How did Earth ever succumb to this?  Hell, Don Henley is a bigger threat.  Plus, they are able to resurrect the dead bodies and use them also, but they move just the same and are about as threatening as the robots.  It was directed by Hammer director Terence Fisher.  Fisher should stick to gothic horror coz Sci-fi isn't his strong point.  That's not saying the movie's a dud coz it is fun.  Two more worthy additions to your Midnite Movie collection.",1193616000,22,2246,4.590452261306533

2875970,4,B000RXVNCE,"This dvd edition of Midnite Movies presents two end of the world theme films.
Chosen Survivors deals with strangers whisked away from their lives to an underground government facility at the start of a nuclear war.  Alas, the facility is not entirely safe.  Jackie Cooper plays a businessman furious at the situation and Alex Cord is a writer overwhelmed with the responsibilty of repopulating the earth.  They sort of stand out in the ensemble cast.  Tension quickly arises between the selected survivors and plays out throughout the film.  The movie was made in the 70's when nuclear annhilation was a popular subject for filmmakers.  As an older sci-fi fan I enjoy seeing a movie from that era.  There's no cgi to fall back on.  The computers are massive and the facility's corridors are the kind common for films of that era.
The Earth Dies Screaming is an older B&W British treatment of an alien invasion which has resulted in mass disappearences.
Both films rely on the strength of its actors (who are pretty good) and fast paced scripts dealing with desperate situations.  A nice combo.",1402444800,,1093,4.864864864864865

2875973,4,B000RXVNCE,"The movie itself is a low-budget affair, but remarkably effective at times.  With its small cast trying to survive in a town devastated by aliens, it reminded me of much later efforts such as The Night of the Living Dead or TV's The Walking Dead.

2875974,2,B000RXVNCE,"The Earth Dies Screaming was one of the corniest scifi movies I have ever seen.

2875975,2,B000RXVNCE,"I love B-movies (it wasn't ""Gone with the Wind"" that got me into cinema, but rather titles such as these) but these two titles are really regrettable. ""Chosen Survivors"" is a potentially good story premise but it is spoiled by a really bad script, ham acting, and too many lulls. I was actually upset that this one didn't go anywhere. ""Earth Dies Screaming"" is not as unpleasant as it sounds, but I found it too empty to be really enjoyable--and brevity is not always a good quality; I felt a bit cheated.
The DVD picture and sound are okay, but the packages offer only a couple of trailers, no extras or commentaries of any merit; ""Chosen Survivors"" isn't the deepest film, but I can imagine what a social context/historical POV audio commentary would have added to the quality of this offering on DVD.
Again I don't like to badmouth the 'B''s, but it's really unfortunate that these two films didn't offer more in the way of quality. Not essential in any way for a collection of more unusual sf/horror titles.",1389225600,,1011,4.622222222222222
2875976,5,B000RXVNCE,"Once, A Long Time Ago, I saw  ""The Earth Dies Screaming"" On Sammy Terry's ""Nightmare Theater"", as It was Called!

This Movie Is one of The 60's Gems and A Must See, Kind of Like the Movie ""Target Earth (1954)"" Only I Think the Robots Are Much More Creepy In This Movie.  So Do Yourself A Favor, and Get This Movie, and Watch it Alone with the lights off!  That way The Robots will Miss You!

The Other Movie was, a Movie of the Week, I Think, and I'm not sure if I saw it or Not!  Another End of the World By Nuclear Destruction, but, it was a nice Extra!",1389139200,,820,4.217948717948718
2875977,5,B000RXVNCE,"To have both of these films in such a superlative package and with high quality transfers is remarkable in itself...

CHOSEN SURVIVORS (1974) offers a unique post-apocalyptic premise: When Doomsday comes, what will happen to the little society that survives? Will they survive TOGETHER? Will they survive EACH OTHER? Buoyed up by talents like Bradford Dillman (Escape from the Planet of the Apes, The Mephisto Waltz), Jackie Cooper (Our Gang comedies, Superman), and Diana Muldaur (Star Trek, The Rockford Files, Gunsmoke), Lincoln Kilpatrick (The Omega Man, Soylent Green), the film looks great, is fun to watch, and largely lives up to its purpose - depicting sociological implications of survival. It's not quite so heady, but the film is atmospheric in its own way -  I love the subterranean mood and the musical ambiance, heightened by the contentious interplay of the characters, especially the scenery-chewing Jackie Cooper.

THE EARTH DIES SCREAMING (1964) is one of those British horror gems that evokes, merely through its superb black and white photography, a mood of foreboding. It is helmed by HAMMER royalty, Terrence Fisher (Curse of Frankenstein, Horror of Dracula) which, by itself, lends sufficient bona fides to the film. After an alien invasion, robots threaten rural England. They are a slow menace, much like Night of the Living Dead's walking cadavers, but instead of the undead we have a mechanized threat. The story consists in seeing what happens when we throw a random selection of ordinary folks together into the crucible of dire circumstances. Like the first film in this double-bill, the characters must survive each other if they are to survive the ostensible danger.

A HIGHLY recommended two-fer in the brilliant, collectible, and value-packed Midnite Movies series.",1382918400,4,1800,5.3052631578947365
2875978,4,B000RXVNCE,"I enjoyed The Earth Dies Screaming. I found it compelling and we'll acted.  The movie is thought provoking.  Keep in mind that there is very little Sci-Fi action.  The movie's attraction for me comes from the dialogue and the underling tension.  This could happen.

Chosen Survivors has it's moments and surprises.  People isolated, facing survival---you get the picture.  I believe it was a ""made for TV movie"".",1382745600,,412,5.059701492537314
2875979,3,B000RXVNCE,"Literate script, some decent actors and a professional director make for an easily spent hour.

If you're a fan of ""Village of the Damned,"" ""Quatermass and the Pit"", ""X-the Unknown"" or ""The Day the Earth Caught Fire"" among other British Sci-Fi of the 1960s then this charming ( and admittedly somewhat naive) film fits the bill.",1359072000,2,447,4.451219512195122
2875981,3,B000RXVNCE,"I picked up some Midnite Movies classics from 20th Century Fox.  It's a two DVD set with two very strange horror science fiction films.  No extras in these films, except for theatrical trailers.

The first is Chosen Survivors.  The USA has set up several centers like fallout shelters throughout the country.  11 people for each center has been ""chosen by computer"" to be the best and brightest to restart the new world in about six months or so after the bomb drops.

We see these eleven guys and gals being ferried into a fancy elevator, all walking around like they were drunk or drugged.  Turns out they were given sedatives so that they could handle the shock of nuclear annihilation.

Oddly, none of these people knew that they were chosen in advanced.  Just thrown into this bunker with all the comforts of home.  Oh, and there was a maintenance man who happened to be doing a little fixing up and now he can't leave and is stuck with them.

The movie attempts horror with the bats.  Bats everywhere.  And even though the place is supposed to be sealed, bats get in anyway.  Naturally they are vampire bats and they try to suck the blood of everyone there.

Two women are basically nuts.  One screams incessantly, the other laughs hysterically.  Between the both of them, you need earplugs to get through the remainder of the film.

Jackie Cooper must have needed to pay the rent that week for this turkey, though he does a passable job as the rich guy who now is angry at everyone for doing this to him and suspects the government is somehow to blame.

Well, yeah, the government could not even plug up the holes to keep the bats out!  Damn!

The second in this dismal duo is the film The Earth Dies Screaming.  Produced by Robert L. Lippert, the man who also produced Rocketship X-M and The Last Man on Earth, it's about people dying around like flies and how aliens are moving in to take over.

The movie starts out great -- people die in their tracks with cars crashing and trains derailing, planes crashing, etc.  There are a few who survive.  And though they all blame a gas attack, that's never made clear.  It's also never made clear where these aliens come from, why they use robots to do their bidding, nor how they turn the dead people into zombies to do their bidding.  All very strange.

One of the characters in this play is very furtive and sneaky and freaks out when someone tries to burn ""worthless money.""  Why does he freak?  Does he know more than we do?  Never explained.

Willard Parker does pretty well as the American who is running the show for these sneaky, freaked-out English-people.

What really got me was this one gal who would run from the zombies but never closes the door behind her.  In one scene, the door even has a lock and she leaves it open and cowers in a corner.  Damn girl, lock the freaking door!!

A frustrating film, moves slow and is hampered by a silly script.  The acting however was quite well done and not too over the top.

2875982,2,B000RXVNCE,"It's not completely awful, but it doesn't quite work, either. The ending is startling in the way it crashes to an abrupt, anti-climactic, well-that-wraps-it-up-and-thank-you-for-coming dive for the final frame; all the more startling because the rest of the movie tended to plod along. The robots and zombies are traditionally cheesy (as usual, the simple solution is to outrun them, which is trivial to manage, but too rarely accomplished by our hapless heroes). And despite the title, if you're hoping for screaming British babes in desperate circumstances, this is very much the wrong movie. No babes, and really very little screaming.

If you have popcorn, and other viewers to help you cope with the plodding moments (and there are many), you might manage occasional flashes of amused oh-that's-so-bad, but there's no real suspense to be had here, and it's hard to care about any of the characters. The acting is, well, I've seen worse. (I've seen Manos, after all.)

Still, a step up from Cat Women of the Moon, Teenager from Outer Space, and the frighteningly awful Astounding She Monster.",1243382400,2,1096,5.11731843575419
2875983,4,B000RXVNCE,"MGM presents a decent pair of modest sci-fi offerings on this Midnight Movies double feature DVD of CHOSEN SURVIVORS (1974) and THE EARTH DIES SCREAMING (1965): the former a stylish post-apoc thriller about a disparate group of pre-selected ""survivors"" of a global nuclear holocaust sent to live in a shiny, high-tech underground bunker that soon becomes infested with vampire bats from an adjoining cave; the latter a cool little British chiller in which a U.S. astronaut (Willard Parker) and a handful of survivors of an alien gas attack gather in a rural English village while the robot sentries sporadically patrol the streets and zap people to death. CHOSEN, which long seemed to be available only via a mixed bag of bootleg tapes, has a TV vet, Sutton Roley, at the helm, and his prolificity no doubt came in useful on what seems to be a modest budget (a largely Mexican crew probably helped as well). The sets are all silvery walls and glass panels, 70's futuristic without being garish. Good cast of upper-tier contempo TV regs (Bradford Dillman, Jackie Cooper, Alex Cord, Diana Muldaur, Richard Jaeckel, Lincoln Kilpatrick) works well together in what is essentially a Rod Serling-esque Twilight Zone tale expanded to feature length and marbled with grue.",1241308800,6,1264,5.052631578947368

2875986,5,B000RXVNCE,"""The Earth Dies Screaming"" is loaded with atmosphere made even more effective by the use of the black and white photography within the setting of a quintessentially English village. My favourite of all the science fiction movies I have seen so far. And I've seen a lot!

""Chosen Survivors"" I had never heard of before and only have seen now because of purchasing this double bill DVD for ""The Earth Dies Screaming"". And so glad to have discovered what is a most worthwhile addition to the list of good sci-fi/thriller movies. It has a very effective and rather compellingly intriguing musical score, which I found most enjoyable to listen to in its own right. Also on the menu section of the dvd too.

The story itself seemed like a deep underground version of Big Brother, with the group of people holed up together for a number of weeks.
There were some scenes that looked like possible real-life cruelty, or at least distressing situations, for bats, which I didn't feel very happy about, especially as there was no disclaimer in the credits stating that none had been harmed in the making of the film, but I guess in older movies they didn't have to say that, but I see the bats were credited with having a 'trainer', so hopefully were looked after. - As I'd like to think the birds and fish were too. Hopefully none of the non-human members of the cast came to any harm. (I happen to care about these thing!).

Everyone involved played their parts excellently and the colour effects were utilised very effectively too. The story itself was all too plausable, given the untrustworthiness of many aspects of government. The movie kept my interest throughout and never became boring. Sadly often a rarity.

""The Earth Dies Screaming"" is a short, very watchable British scifi flick about robots who take over the world.  True, the robots aren't very scary and indigestion will give you more nightmares than the human zombies streeling around with their exophthalmic white eyes, but it's a pretty intense movie.  I liked the exciting scene where the lumbering zombies chase one of the surviving women into a house and she desperately tries to escape their clutches.  This movie isn't as good as, say, ""The Crawling Eye,"" (another British scifi film) which was made some seven years earlier, but it has its moments and it has a similar feeling of dread throughout it.  I never saw this movie on TV and I can't understand why not.  It's much better than the average scifi flick.",1210723200,2,910,5.565217391304348

Chosen Survivor:  Fine.  I really think they should have stuck with the original plot--it was more interesting.  Unlike everybody in the movie, I saw the 'brain doctor's' point...maybe it should have been tried like that.

The Earth Dies Screaming.  Pretty fine Science Fiction about the earth being invaded by robots.  Fine idea...but only 64 minutes long.  It's like I've always said...if you make a movie and it's crap (most are today) then keep it short!  If you made a fine movie, add another thirty minutes to it (not fluff)!

I'd just like to put in a plug for ""The Earth Dies Screaming"" as the movie here that I liked better.  (Admittedly, an awful title if one wanted the film to be taken seriously).

A movie directed by Terence Fisher cannot fail to be of interest to genre fans.  Dumb title aside, the plot is reminiscent of The Day of the Triffids; I actually find this film as good if not better than the 60's version of that.  All in all, a sort of Triffids meets Village of the Damned meets Target Earth.  And I can't say enough for the demo-quality black & white transfer.  I know I'll be returning to this film often, something I can't say about ""Chosen Survivors"".

In the movie, ""The Earth Dies Screaming"", you might be surprised to see the survivors using guns and rifles against the space aliens.  This is because the movie was made in 1964 when private citizens were still allowed to own firearms.  Anyway, this is a pretty good British low-budget film.

Chosen Survivors I would only give 3 stars too.  Jackie Cooper is a terrific actor. This movie does not do him justice.",1471651200,,473,4.8625
8202893,4,B000RXVNCE,Good and campy,1461801600,,14,4.0
8202894,3,B000RXVNCE,"As did, I am sure the movie going audience back in the 50s(?) or early 60s.  But, I still love these old low budget Sci-Fi 'movies.  I'll watch it again.  And probably again.",1457740800,,174,4.212121212121212
8202895,2,B000RXVNCE,Slow moving aliens that had to touch their victims to kill them. Zero special effects.,1453766400,,86,4.8
8202896,3,B000RXVNCE,"Yep I counted five good screams in less than an hour.

Like in The Village of the Damned everyone falls asleep or possibly dead.
Jeff Nolan (Willard Parker), Peggy (Virginia Field) and a hand full of others survive to face an enemy that will make your eyes bug out.

The plot taken from many B movie themes is a mixture of Target Earth (Which also had only one or two robots), tossed in with some of those Walking dead things. The only thing they forgot to do is use flame throwers and threaten little dogs.",1451606400,,507,4.326315789473684
8202897,4,B000RXVNCE,"Corny, yeah. Silly, yeah. What 1950s-60s Sci fi B films were all about, YEAH.
For those of us that enjoy B&W films on low budgets this is a gem. The zombies and robots are not fancy but funny and the cast is a mix of serious to drunk. Good fun.",1449014400,,244,3.9
8202898,5,B000RXVNCE,"I gave this is a gift I'm thinking about buying one for myself, my friend said he liked it very much! He gave it the five star rating",1446508800,,133,3.7857142857142856
