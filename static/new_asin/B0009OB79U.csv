8064118,4,B0009OB79U,"Four classic episodes from Loretta Young's classic anthology series, THE LORETTA YOUNG SHOW (aka ""Letter to Loretta"" and ""The Loretta Young Theatre""). Young takes center-stage in stories that were always well-written and featured great supporting performances from a versatile cast. Perhaps more famous than the show itself was Young's grand entrance at the start of each episode, where she would magically twirl into the camera wearing a gorgeous designer gown (many people would tune in just to see what fabulous creation Loretta would appear in). Classic TV at it's height!

Includes the following episodes:

""Big Jim"" - Loretta plays a woman with a shady past who comes back into the life of her now-teenaged son (played by Bobby Driscoll).

""600 Seconds"" - Loretta plays a socialite who receives a mysterious telephone call about her husband. Her mind imagines all kinds of drastic scenarios centering on her husband's fidelity.

""Switch Blade"" - Loretta plays kindly Sister Ann, whose hospital salary of 25 cents becomes the key to helping a friend in need.

""Cayuse"" - Loretta plays a young girl who begs a handsome stranger to find her beloved pony Ginger.
--------------------------------------------
""Switch Blade"" is the only episode that features Young's entrance. The other three episodes are taken from syndication prints (under the ""Loretta Young Theatre"" title), which omit Young's entrance.
