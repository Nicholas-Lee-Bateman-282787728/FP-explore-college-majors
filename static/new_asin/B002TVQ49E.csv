But for a full length feature you do get to see an early version of Ray as an actor.",1508803200,,256,4.019607843137255

8380710,4,B002TVQ49E,"Most people are familiar with the Ray Charles bio-pic, ""Ray,"" but ""Ballad in Blue"" is a movie that features the real deal. A British production, Ray plays . . . himself. It's not much of a stretch, but he does have to act. The gist of the movie centers around him interacting with a young fan. If you're unaccustomed to watching movies from ""across the pond"" it might take you several minutes to get used to the British accent. Ray's music is, of course, featured. The casual Ray Charles fan might not appreciate the movie, but fans of Ray Charles should definitely see it.",1470009600,,573,4.519230769230769

8380712,5,B002TVQ49E,I enjoyed this movie. Ray Charles was one of my favorite singers. I did not know he was in a movie until I saw it on television. I was happy to be able to purchase it. Thanks to Amazon.,1400544000,,185,3.769230769230769
