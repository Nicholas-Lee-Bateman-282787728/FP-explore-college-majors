8707224,5,B00UKNOIQ4,"I checked this out from my local library and was MORE than pleasantly surprised. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in WWII. There are many fantastic and very poignant interviews with veterans. There are some pretty amazing modern day explosions as well to give a feel for what it might have been like, if only in a small way. I honestly didn't expect this to be so well done. Very much worth adding to your collection. There are soldiers from different countries which is also a nice touch. Americans are well represented, but you also hear from Brits and Canadians. Give this one a try and you won't be disappointed.",1440547200,5,626,4.648648648648648
