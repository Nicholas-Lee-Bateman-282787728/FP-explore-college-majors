8455099,5,B0053CAM12,"A classic that should be in every collection. Truly a deep look into the human condition and a wonderful look back at Roseland.
Roseland was a ballroom on 52nd street in New York City which closed April 7 2014 after decades of events. To have missed being there at least once in a lifetime one would have missed the grandest of Ballrooms. This film does great justice as to what it was like in the50's  60's  and 70;s
I could not imagine 52nd and Broadway without that bright red sign lighting up the night  ""Roseland""  yet it has come to pass.",1431043200,,544,4.356435643564357
