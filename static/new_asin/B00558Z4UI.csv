4572419,3,B00558Z4UI,"At this point in time it would seem that there's nowhere left for film vampires to go. From Billy the Kid vs. Dracula to Dracula: Dead and Loving It to Let the Right One In all possible film genres have taken a crack at bloodsuckers. Maybe it's time for vampire stories to move on to ballet or Damien Hirst-style installation art. But wait! Here's something new: a vampire film actually filmed in Romania, the country that invented the damn things. And just to add to the novelty factor the film is set in the here and now and features Romanian actors working in English from a script written by an Englishwoman, Faye Jackson, who also directed the film.

.

Another variation is that the undead in this film are called Strigoi, which is evidently a kind of downmarket vampire. The Strigoi, it seems, simply refuse to remain dead due to grievances they have with the living. And although they do take blood, they also seem to be content to gorge on whatever food is handy. The story has Vlad (of course), a medical student, returning to his ancestral village after a failed attempt to make a life for himself in Italy. He's arrived shortly after a local couple, the Tirescus, have been killed by the villagers. The Tirescus were local tyrants first under the Communists as well as after the fall of Ceausescu. Even after death Constantin and Elena Tirescu haunt the village. Constantin still strives to buy up all the land, and Elena is content to eat everyone out of house and home. Vlad tries to be rational about what's going on around him, but in the end he has to do some vampire hunting.

The political message in Strigoi is obvious but interesting; communists, and now capialists, continue to plague the Romanian people with their insatiable thirst for power and wealth and...blood.  The political aspect to the film isn't overplayed, and neither is it a splatterfest. The film's tone is droll, observational, and quite laidback. The actors have to be commended for doing an excellent job in their second language, and despite the low budget the film has a very polished look. It would be a better film if it was shorter and if the humour was not so understated, but it's definitely an interesting addition to the vampire genre.

4572420,5,B00558Z4UI,"Currently pop culture is in the middle of a vampire craze, especially if those vampires are sexy. But long ago, vampires were anything but sexy -- they were strigoi.

And those are the kind of vampires that keep popping up in ""Strigoi: The Undead,"" a tongue-in-cheek horror/comedy that takes us right back to the origins of vampire myth. Director Faye Jackson weaves together Romanian folklore with a murder plot and lots of dodgy land papers, as well as a heavy dose of morbid humor.

A young almost-doctor named Vlad (Catalin Paraschiv) returns home to the village of Podoleni, to stay with his slightly-crazy grandfather. He soon discovers that the town drunk Florin is dead, and it looks like someone strangled him. But for some reason, everybody in the town claims it was an accident, and most of them have fine new appliances and clothes. Even the priest is close-lipped about it.

Vlad also drops in to ask greedy land-owner Constantin (Constantin Barbulescu) about it... only to find that Constantin and his wife are flushed, growling and ravenously hungry.

Vlad keeps investigating the conspiracy, which seems to involve post-Communism land deals, forgery and corruption. But he doesn't know that bodies are being found drained of blood, and that the village's conspiracy of silence has led to the strigoi's presence. If the killing (and fridge-emptying) is going to stop, Vlad will have to do something himself.

""Strigoi: The Undead"" is an odd sort of movie -- it's equal parts gory horror, murder mystery and coming-home-to-find-yourself indie comedy. But the film's real charm is in Faye Jackson's depiction of a traditional Romanian village in the modern age -- think Vlad sauntering forth to slay vampires, while chatting on a cell phone.

So there's a lot of off-kilter, tongue-in-cheek dialogue  (""Do you have any other symptoms... apart from hunger, insomnia and wanting me to stick my finger up your ***?"") and funny moments (the villagers almost bury Vlad, thinking he's a strigoi). But there are some deep emotional moments, such as Vlad's grandfather talking about his attachment to the land he had to wrest back from the Communists.

And... it's kind of refreshing to see a movie that dips back into vampire lore, instead of just recycling the same ol' Anne Rice/Dracula/Twilight stuff. These vampires are bloody, ruddy and eat anything they can chew. Including, but not limited to, people.

And Podoleni has a delightfully quirky cast of characters -- the pro-marijuana cop, the guilt-ridden priest, the harried housewife cooking for a ravenous strigoi, and an old man convinced that Communists and/or gypsies are stealing his cigarettes. And Paraschiv's Vlad makes a nice underdog hero -- he's sort of adrift in his own life, feeling like a failure. Nothing like vampires to give your life a little purpose.

""Strigoi: The Undead"" is a delicious mix of murder mystery and traditional vampire lore, with plenty of blood, quirkiness and missing dogs. A must-see for fans of the undead!",1310947200,28,3009,5.085192697768763

4572460,4,B00558Z4UI,"The Strigoi is a different and interesting take on the vampire film, not the least because although produced by a British film studio it was shot in Romania with an all-Romanian cast. Romania, which includes all of Transylvania, is the home of virtually all vampire folklore which begins all the way back with the Dacians, who inhabited the area in the days of the Roman Empire. The use of Strigoi instead of vampire has become popular in recent years in film (Vampire Academy) and TV and graphic novels (The Strain).

To get this movie you need to know a little about the Strigoi. These are not your usual vampires. They are not the sullen teenagers of the Twilight Series, or the suave Count Dracula variety, nor are they the violent drifters of Near Dark or the ravenous, animalistic monsters of films like 30 Days of night or Stake Land. The Strigoi are complex, coming in two varieties: the Strigoi Viv and the Strigoi Mort. The Viv are living Strigoi and have sometimes been portrayed as sorcerers or magicians; in this film they also feed on the blood of the living. The Mort are the dead and are the really dangerous ones, often portrayed as part demonic. Unlike our usual film vampires, the Strigoi Mort don't know they are vampires and in fact don't know that they are dead. Thus they go back to their usual lives and activities not remembering their deaths or transformations. They are exhausted and tired by day but not destroyed by sunlight, and become active at night. They have unexplained ravenous hunger which causes them to eat enormous amounts of food or find other sources such as blood. They can be destroyed by a wooden stake through the heart, burning their heart and burying the rest of their remains at a crossroads.

Now to the movie. It was a brilliant idea to actually film in Romania and use Romanian actors. This gave it a realism that couldn't have been done in a British studio. The look of the actual village, the dress of the townspeople, the little details like the lace curtains, the radio with flashing lights, and the odd mix of old and new were the result of actually being there. The actors, of course, look authentic. Though the film begins in Romanian it quickly switches to English to make the film commercially bankable. I would have preferred that it be entirely in Romanian with English subtitles for realism and also because some of the heavily accented English is difficult to follow. The story: a young Romanian (Vlad) returns to his village after working in Italy where he was unhappy. While he was gone a greedy couple (the Tirescu's) who had done well under the Communist Cheaucescu regime has been trying to buy up all the land in the area using the confusion about deeds (the Communists had nationalized all the land and now you had to show an old deed from pre-1945 to prove ownership) to obtain more. An old farmer has died, possibly murdered. The villagers want to kill the Tirescu's but seem unable. Vlad suspects the farmer was murdered and wants to involve the police but gets no help and much confusion from everyone around. That's as far as I'll go so as not to ruin anything.

The movie is interesting but despite its many good elements it never really catches fire. Though well-acted and with good cinematography - a rare thing with small budget films like this - after a good beginning it bogs down and becomes slow and repetitious. Vlad holds on to his denial of anything supernatural going on far too long, the same actions go on multiple times and there seems to be no pacing. A good rewrite and a trimming of fifteen to twenty minutes would have made a much better film. Still, this is not to deny its uniqueness and good elements including the authentic music.

If you think you might like a different take on vampires with indie movie values which is more of a mystery-suspense film with comic overtones you might like this. Just don't expect great horror or tense pacing. It's interesting but not great.",1454803200,2,3975,4.6581196581196584

4572485,1,B00558Z4UI,"This film has all the ingredients to be an enjoyable black horror/comedy.  Solid acting, witty dialogue, appropriately believable scenery and even a plot that eschews the normal vampire film lore in favor of something a little more relevant to the setting.  This is why it's all the more perplexing that it turned out to be such a colossal disappointment.  Don't worry, this review contains no spoilers because it simply can't.

The big problem with this film is that literally nothing is resolved by the end.

Big mystery of who's stealing the land out from under whom and exactly who's involved?  Never solved.
What are the ""dirty secrets"" one strigoi threatens to tell about the local priest?  Never revealed.
Why does everyone seem to get warts all over them and what does it mean?  Who knows? Certainly not me after investing close to 90 minutes on this dud.

I understand that movies don't always benefit from being wrapped up neatly at the end, but this film is the equivalent of reading a crime novel only to find the last chapter has been ripped out.  We seemingly get closer and closer to the answers and then at the end, the director simply decides to just chop off the film.  The story implies things, but then it implies the exact opposite.  At the end, one has no idea what really happened and can only guess.  And I don't mean guess like the Sopranos open ending, I mean guess as in ""Uh...what the heck did I just waste an hour and a half watching?""

4572490,2,B00558Z4UI,"After watching ""Chernobyl Diaries"" we were ready for another European tale of horror, so ""Strigoi"" seemed like a good choice.  It wasn't.

Young Vlad Cozna (Catalin Paraschiv) has returned home to the Romanian village of Podoleni from an unsuccessful jaunt in Italy.  He never did quite get his doctoral degree, so Vlad's pondering his next move at his grandfather Nicolae's place (Rudy Rosenfeld) when he discovers something's not right in town.  Everyone has new appliances, the town drunk appears to be strangled to death, and nobody's talking.  The easy villain is greedy landowner Constantin Tireczu (Constantin Barbulescu) and his wife Ileana (Roxana Guttman), who are loathed by everyone in town for buying up the land and selling it to foreigners.  This is a constant thread throughout ""Strigoi"" - that although the people have stayed put the land has been sold out from under them, in essence turning them into zombies.

And that's probably the easiest way to describe ""Strigoi"" to Americans.  It's about living, working zombies who don't even realize they're dead.  Unfortunately  Faye Jackson doesn't do much to explain the finer parts of Romanian culture; we just have to figure it out as we go.

The vampire/zombie confusion isn't helped by the competing types of strigoi. There's the living strigoi viu, who are a daylight-tolerating kind of vampire that feeds on blood.  Then there's the strigoi mort, a more typical shambling undead. And for some reason, everyone has boils that continue to grow across their bodies without explanation.

Vlad tries valiantly to do the right thing.  When he suspects foul play he calls the police (Vlad Jipa).  When he suspects the Tireczu's have been wronged he speaks to the man directly.  But dialogue goes in circles and then nowhere at all, frequently punctuated by blackouts.

I'm adding blackouts to my pet peeve of slow-motion scenes and grainy flashbacks as signs of an inexperienced director.  It disrupts the narrative flow of the story, and because we never know precisely how strigoi work, the blackouts are never explained.  Is it strigoi mind powers? Signs of a pending infection? A curse?  Or is Vlad just really tired all the time?

The mystery of who killed whom isn't much of a mystery at all since the film begins with a murder. The recurrent theme - that Romanians are tilling a land they no longer own - is framed early and then beaten into the ground.  Jackson seems to be saying that everyone, from the housewife who cooks relentlessly for a man nobody liked to the villagers who stay watch over an unloved corpse, are the living dead.  Unfortunately it takes far too long for ""Strigoi"" to shamble to its conclusion.",1339027200,3,2689,4.966442953020135

8457653,4,B00558Z4UI,"Funny and sad as it portrays the difficulties arising from post-communist Romania which can be seen in other countries as well including the US as ordinary people try to recover from the consequences of bad politics.

8457658,5,B00558Z4UI,"it's refreshing and much more interesting to see a movie that dips back into vampire lore, instead of just recycling the same ol' Anne Rice/Twilight crap. This movie takes us to a village in Romania for Vlad's sake. You can feel the culture right off the screen. And the humor is dry and real and spontaneous. It makes you laugh and it's creepy a little scary and I think easy to follow. Well developed characters, beautiful camera work, the cast was awesome and fun, great story, the director was fabulous. I can not for the life of me understand why some found it unlikable in any way? I was glued to the screen thru the end and sorry that it did end. Bravo.",1474761600,,660,4.373983739837398
