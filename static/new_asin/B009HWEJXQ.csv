5339561,5,B009HWEJXQ,"Great performances and an intriguing premise -- just as spooky as any classic X-Files episode, which is the highest praise I can offer up.",1365638400,3,138,4.791666666666667
5339562,2,B009HWEJXQ,I was not expecting something this short. Must not have been over 15 minutes long. It was a decent story and I liked the actors and just wish it had been at least 45 minutes to an hours.,1357516800,,186,3.9210526315789473
5339572,5,B009HWEJXQ,In all this was a satisfying little short with some fantastic cinematography and excellent acting.  The story is a little lean but this is a short we're talking about so I can't hold that against it - in fact it just adds to the 'Twilight Zone' feel of the film.  I feel like the director could have done a little more with the premise but it was still very effective.  The twist ending was telegraphed (unlike M. Night's nonsense) but still an enjoyable beat to close the film.,1398643200,,478,4.409090909090909
5339573,2,B009HWEJXQ,"First, whoever created the description for the film already told you the entire movie. The film is only 17 minutes w/out the credits, so the most obvious answer to your question is the right one. 5 minutes in we see a little boy outside the scene of the most recent murder with a piece of paper in hand, answer: he's drawing the creatures doing the killing. 10 minutes in she calls her son a 2nd time while on the investigation to find out the # she's calling is a wrong number, answer: she's one of the kids drawings. On top of the obviousness of it all, it's poorly acted.

What I will say positive about it, is that had this been a feature film, more fleshed out, given the ability to toy with this plotline (and better acted) I think it could be an entertaining movie.",1397347200,,772,4.287671232876712
5339574,1,B009HWEJXQ,"Only 20 minutes long... Just when the story is getting started, its over. Complete waste of time. You're better off watching an old episode of the X-Files instead.",1397260800,,163,4.857142857142857
5339575,1,B009HWEJXQ,Really? A 20 minute short that leaves you feeling majorly cheated! I was unimpressed on every level! Watch an episode of X files instead!,1397174400,,137,4.75
5339576,2,B009HWEJXQ,"Terrible story, terrible acting.  Decent twist at the end, but that's not enough to save it.  The best thing I can say about it is that it wasn't too long.",1394668800,,155,4.133333333333334
5339577,5,B009HWEJXQ,"I enjoy a good short movie and this one did not disappoint. It is a really good sci-fi/horror story that could very well be a Twilight Zone episode; if the show were on today.

The film develops it's characters quickly and the plot zips right along. This idea could easily be made into a 90 minute movie and would be enjoyable as well.",1394323200,,335,4.317460317460317
5339578,1,B009HWEJXQ,"this is the worse short film ever. you all obviously have bad taste! bad bad bad!...bad

5339579,4,B009HWEJXQ,"I really enjoyed this short!  At first, it seemed as if I had it figured out...boy is the key, women saves boy, dad dies, happy ending for all!  The twist at the end was awesome!  Not going to say anything more because I'll spoil it, but this is a must see.",1393545600,3,257,4.0
5339580,4,B009HWEJXQ,Not normally a fan of short movies but since sci-fi is my favorite genre I gave it a try. Glad I did. Definitely has an x-files/outer limits/twilight zone feel to it. Shame it wasn't longer but it was entertaining.,1393113600,3,214,4.512820512820513
5339581,5,B009HWEJXQ,"It was a short movie,but it was good,I truly enjoyed it. It has a lesson to be learned in the end. I would highly recommend this movie",1392940800,2,134,4.0
5339582,3,B009HWEJXQ,"Though only a 20 minute short film, ""Void"" somehow it still manages to be slow moving. Nevertheless, a relatively unexpected, cute ending made it worth the watch. (Any Tales from the Crypt fans? Two words: ""Korman's Kalamity."")",1392940800,3,227,5.162162162162162
5339583,4,B009HWEJXQ,"I liked this movie, even if I did see the twist ending coming. The acting is good, the story is good, the special effects (what few there are) never let the story down, and the main characters are at least interesting. This is a story that could have stood to be somewhat longer - it feels a bit rushed and strained in places, and I think the ending would have been more poignant if we'd had more time to grow to like the characters.

It is a nice little vignette, though.

5339584,2,B009HWEJXQ,I am only giving this 2 stars because I didn't understand it and I honestly need to watch it again.,1392768000,,99,4.0
5339585,5,B009HWEJXQ,"Excellent short story.  Seriously, it was really good.  The story was well written and the acting was exceptional.  Much better than some of the Twilight Zone movies I have seen.",1392249600,3,178,4.866666666666666
5339586,5,B009HWEJXQ,"It was crisp, spooky and evoked memories of the Twilight Zone, X-Files and other legendary shows. I would recommend this movie to anyone.",1391385600,2,137,5.0
5339587,5,B009HWEJXQ,"I really hope Ms. Berg continues to write and direct movies. This felt like an episode of ""The Twilight Zone-"" it had just the right combination of ""creepy"" and ""twisted"" to spin a good yarn.",1390867200,,191,4.485714285714286
5339588,2,B009HWEJXQ,"This short was aimed directly at those not well-rounded in the horror genre and easily impressed by wrapping not content.  It borrows, or steals if you will, directly from dozens of well known predecessors, with each scene either ""common"" or predictable.

Quirky best describes the conscious attempt of the director.  Characters' strange expressions, odd entrances, unexpected appearances, an inappropriate title, yield nothing but a sense of pretentious inconsonance, in no way enhances the story, and can only be taken as trappings.

This film is a result of production resource and others' ideas.  A mishmash of well worn tricks of the trade jumbled together and presented as ""art"".

2 stars and a ho-hum",1390694400,,707,5.267857142857143
5339589,5,B009HWEJXQ,"Very compelling.  Note sure I got everything. I need to see it a few more times.  I wanted to learn more, see more of each character. Very well done, Brava!",1390435200,,156,4.166666666666667
5339590,3,B009HWEJXQ,"Not bad but was expecting a full lengthe movie, this is more of a short film.  It was good though.",1390003200,,98,3.9
5339591,4,B009HWEJXQ,"I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this turned out to be an interesting short film.  I have to admit I have a fondness for slightly quirky horror films if they can cause me to suspend belief for a moment or two.  This one has that quality, so you might find yourself staying for the unusual ending.",1389830400,,302,4.189655172413793
5339592,5,B009HWEJXQ,Definitely a unique style!  Short movie effectively produced with excellent storyline. Watch with grandkids with lights turned out and thermostat dropped 10 degrees (adds to dhill effect for kids!).,1389744000,,198,5.827586206896552
5339593,5,B009HWEJXQ,"Its a modern Twilight Zone with a bit of the 80's show ""Tales from The Dark Side"". You don't see the ending coming. A little bit of horror and some good acting for what it is. This should be made into a TV series and with different stories like this one. This will leave you wanting something more.",1389571200,,298,4.155172413793103
5339594,5,B009HWEJXQ,Very good for a short film.  Highly recommend for sci-fy fans.  I really enjoyed this short little film.  So go check it out.,1389139200,,125,4.3478260869565215
5339595,1,B009HWEJXQ,"Really, really dumb.  In fact, one of the dumbest movies ever--I couldn't even get through more than 30 minutes of it.",1389139200,,118,4.619047619047619
5339596,4,B009HWEJXQ,I thought I was just watching a remake of a Twilight Zone episode; this turned out not to be the case.,1388966400,,102,3.9047619047619047
5339597,4,B009HWEJXQ,"That being said, it will make you want more. But hey, it's an appetizer right? Right. The plot develops, the mystery is explored, some significant resolution, and Bam!; the movie is over.",1388880000,2,187,4.875
5339598,4,B009HWEJXQ,"Wow. What a great short story. And I do mean short. But to me, this 20 minute video was better than a lot of the 2 hour long movies out there today. It had everything you need from beginning to end without all the extra baggage. The acting was good, the story unique and just long enough for me to sit down and enjoy while eating my dinner. (Of course, the beginning may not be something you prefer to watch while eating spaghetti and meatballs, if you catch my drift!)",1388707200,,469,4.222222222222222
5339599,4,B009HWEJXQ,"A nice, short film.  Very Twilight Zone like.  Interesting story and characters.  Not great, but good.  The female lead is a little not-so-believable as an FBI agent.",1388448000,,166,5.037037037037037
5339600,4,B009HWEJXQ,"I'm a Twilight Zone Fan. In my collection is an episode where a kid (Billy Mumy) holds a town hostage with his imagination. Void has all the same similarities. Some details are different but it is still a similar story line right down to the child bonding with a special ""mother."" The acting is pretty good. Scenes are to the point. No wasted time on meaningless dialog. Definitely a show that will make you go, ""hmmmmm."" However, what in the world is the pink slime all about???",1388275200,,479,4.517241379310345
5339601,5,B009HWEJXQ,"Psychological with muted sexual undertones, this story brings another kind of creation right out of the Void. And reflects the terror of our present day cultural structures.",1388102400,,173,5.444444444444445
5339602,5,B009HWEJXQ,"This is a 4.5 rating, only because I wanted it to continue beyond where it ends.  That said, always leave them wanting more, which is what this little gem accomplishes.  The story is intriguing, and the acting is very good.  This film has ""X-Files"" stamped all over it, as it weaves the noir/thriller/sci-fi/horror genres into a seamless, captivating (and character-driven) story.  It's only 20 minutes, so what do you have to loose? Watch it, and judge for yourself.",1388016000,3,467,4.948717948717949
5339603,3,B009HWEJXQ,"perhaps all movies should be condensed or compressed into less time. Get to the point.
Don't most of our adventures in life occur within small events, as far as time passing?",1387497600,,174,4.645161290322581
5339604,4,B009HWEJXQ,"A simple story of the supernatural with enough twists to keep you interested. Good for what is, certainly worth your 20 minutes.",1387411200,2,128,4.863636363636363
5339605,4,B009HWEJXQ,"Nothing new, but well acted and a nice little turn of the story that has been told before. Very much reminded me of a TZ movie I've seen.",1387324800,,137,3.9285714285714284
5339606,5,B009HWEJXQ,"There is nothing void of movie. Acting is good ,Take a peek . I especialy like the music ...very 70's horror.

5339607,5,B009HWEJXQ,"There are unbelievable movies that drag on and on...this was short and sweet, it ended quickly but brilliantly...praise for the actress, who was good and great looking. they developed a plot like no other I've thought of...5 stars for execution.

5339608,5,B009HWEJXQ,"Special agent Liz Metera (Jennifer Christopher) is investigating a series of grisly mutilations. All evidence points to animal attacks, but each victim is torn to pieces in a different way. As Metera digs deeper, she finds herself in an unimaginable situation. VOID is a tremendously well-made short film that is an X-FILES fan's dream-come-true! If you enjoy horror, the supernatural, or monsters, then VOID should make your night! My only complaint is that it's too short (20 min.)!...",1386460800,15,487,5.256410256410256
5339609,5,B009HWEJXQ,"This was an extremely cool short which would have fit in well in any weird tales/creepshow type anthology. I loved it. Meredith Berg (No, I don't know her) did a fantastic job as both the writer and director. Kudos!",1386288000,2,215,4.538461538461538
5339610,4,B009HWEJXQ,"Nicely done. Some viewers cite the Twilight Zone, understandably, but I felt a more Lynchian vibe, perhaps because many of the sets & color schemes suggested Lynch (& perhaps Night of the Hunter in the final set). Personally it would have helped me greatly to view it with closed captions, but their lack isn't a flaw of the film itself. It had some nice details, e.g., the protagonist using a pay phone--seems odd at first, but makes sense later on. Definitely an idea that could be expanded effectively into feature length without too much difficulty. I look forward to more work by this filmmaker.",1385942400,3,600,4.778846153846154
5339611,3,B009HWEJXQ,"I was disappointed that it was so short. I settled in for an hour and a half of enjoyment and only got 20 minutes. So, when it ended, I was disappointed. Had I been expecting a ""short,"" I might have liked it more.",1385510400,,213,3.9767441860465116
5339612,5,B009HWEJXQ,"This short film was totally strange, unsettling, and very cool.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  It was also kind of heartbreaking.",1384992000,3,133,5.285714285714286
5339613,5,B009HWEJXQ,"Whoa this is so good the little boy is frickin awesome, good work kid, when you watch you'll see what I mean, this was very well written, superb acting, and I love the plot which ended with a great twist",1384732800,4,203,4.1
5339614,3,B009HWEJXQ,"I agree with many of the reviewer's who said that this short film had the feel of an episode of the X-Files or the Twilight zone.  That's exactly what it reminded me of with its sci-fi vibe.  The acting is about as good as you'd get in an episode of the Twilight zone; kinda cheesy (no offense to fans).  I wouldn't call it scary though, at least I didn't find it scary at all, just bloody.  It's a little creepy and has an interesting twist that makes it worth the twenty minutes.",1384560000,8,481,4.195652173913044
5339615,5,B009HWEJXQ,"with an excellent cast, particularly the young boy.  The writing was superb and I didn't expect the twist at the end.  I want to see more films like this.  Bravo!",1384560000,2,162,4.333333333333333
5339616,4,B009HWEJXQ,"Take 20 min to watch the film. You won't be sorry.
 Excellent acting from everyone and great story. I would love to see if they could make it a full length feature. This is an excellent short story and could easily be extended to full length with all the thrills and chills it has.",1383696000,,281,4.203703703703703
5339617,5,B009HWEJXQ,"What an incredible short film!  I am often wary about trying short films, simply because I don't have a lot of time for entertainment, and it's harder to determine quality than studio films, since they have smaller audiences and fewer reviews--just overall less ""buzz"", so it can be a crapshoot.  Well, this one's a winner, folks! I loved this film!  The story was pretty original, I did not see the twist coming (and I always see the twist coming!), and the acting was quite good for a little indie, especially Michael Len as the little boy.  Alternately creepy, terrified, angry, and sweet, this little thespian had me believing every second of his performance.  Basically, he steals the movie.  I guess a good measure of the quality of a short film is if you want to know more, if you want to experience that world a little longer, and I do.  I'm still thinking about this film hours later.  I will most certainly be looking out for what this writer/director does in the future!  If you like intelligent fantasy/horror like ""The Others"", this one's for you!",1382745600,11,1060,4.686486486486486
5339618,5,B009HWEJXQ,"I think that the best vehicle for horror fantasy is the short film. It's like poetry compared to prose. VOID is poetry. Meredith Berg has written and directed a magnificent fantasy horror story. If you are a fan of The Twilight Zone, Stephen King, M. Night Shyamalan, or movies like ""The Others"" and ""The Innocents"" you should check this movie out. I enjoyed watching it over and over to catch all the delightful details sprinkled throughout. I can't wait to see what this talented filmmaker creates in the future!",1382313600,,514,4.786516853932584

5339620,4,B009HWEJXQ,"I highly recommend this short.  It had a great style to it and the suspense was perfect.  I thoroughly enjoyed the acting, directing and filmmaking of this film.

8541682,5,B009HWEJXQ,"I am a big fan of The Twilight Zone and Outer Limits.  I have seen every episode of both shows.  I could go into detail about reasons I liked this film... but it would probably be more helpful to sum it up in a way that would inform those people who are thinking about giving it a go.

If you put the title sequence of The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits at the beginning of this short film and called it ""A lost, unaired episode""... No one would ever know the difference.

I was surprised to see a few negative reviews... but those reviews are pretty watery.  I had a roommate who did not like Braveheart.  If you look online, I bet you will find a bad review of The Godfather.  Does that mean those are bad movies?  Of course not... some people just do not like some things.  No big whoop.  Not everything ever made is going to be liked by every human.

This is a solid short film that plays quickly and has some nice turns.  Glad I stumbled upon it!
