I did the overview, now lets talk about the DVD.

You get 11 Episodes, each is around a 5-10 minute range. There's nothing really new in the episodes compared to the free versions you can get on YouTube. Some has dialog reworked, but it's just not worth it.

Special Features are all stuff you can just watch online for free, too. You do get a Making Of feature, which is pretty neat, however some of it is stupid and it's only 3 minutes long, which isn't worth it at all.

Bottom Line, 13 dollars for this DVD is just stupid. I wouldn't pay a dollar for this. I'd just go down an alleyway, pick up change, and whatever I find, I'll buy it with.

I hear Volume 2 and 3 are better, but they're 15 dollars, which is going above and beyond what they're worth. Volume 4 actually has somewhat decent episodes, however it's not out yet. Darn it.",1313712000,6,1231,4.37719298245614

2999492,1,B000X9LVQA,"In 2004, the Angry Nintendo Nerd was created. A few years later, he was now known as the Angry Video Game Nerd. Even though there are countless ripoffs of him being spawned, the AVGN is still the best of the bunch.

One of those ripoffs is the Irate Gamer. He's so terrible that I even blocked him from my channel on YouTube. His videos are THAT bad.

How bad is he compared to AVGN? Very. He never even plays the games he ""reviews"". He only acts like he's playing, despite that he has several hundred cartridges sitting on the shelf! Speaking of acting, that's another disappointment. He is bad at acting. No one ever seems to get to play a part in the show for some reason (Do you know why? Because I sure do), so he dresses up as another character, so it looks like he's talking to somebody.

This is all you even need to know to figure out whether to buy this DVD or not. If this review doesn't help, then go watch his sadistic videos for more info.

Chris Bores....yep, he sure does. Chris Bores a lot. Even his name gives away the fact that this series would be terrible.",1295654400,13,1077,4.264705882352941

2999494,1,B000X9LVQA,"Ok, I guess the obvious James Rolf imitation has been pointed out more than enough, so I will not focus on this point too much, just on the artistic level of Mr. Bores. And to be frank, there is not much to talk about. Chris Bores ist just a horrible actor, a horrible writer and a horrible director. This production showed that there was almost no creativity involved in making the show, and you can just clearly see by the selection of games he ""reviews"" (the "" "" are there because calling this sorry effort a review would be really pushing the term) that he does not review them out of nostalgic reasons, you simply get the impression that it was the first time he ever played them while reviewing. This might actually be a decent concept for a show, seeing how folks from today, spoiled by fancy 3D graphics and HD Resolutions, react on games that have neither of the two and work on a totally different scale. The problem is: that's not what he was going for. I watched this DVD with a friend of mine who bought it at a garage sale for about 1$ (and in my oppinion, that is still 99 cents too much), and it was almost unwatchable. Sure, he may have put in nice special effects and all (what an effort, even I can put these things in with a decent video editor, and I don't even own a camcorder), but the rest of the show is just a disaster. It is poorly written, poorly acted (please please Mr. Bores, tell me that you are not trying to act in your show and that you just have poor anger management), and on top of all, Mr. Bores' voice is just so hard to listen to that it makes my throat all gooey just by listening to his throaty, muffled, mumbled voice. I can truly and honestly say that this is the worst piece of video I have ever layed my eyes on, at least the worst piece anyone ever asked money for. If I could, I would rate this whole DVD with 0 Stars, because this is not a D or D-, this is an F. F for failure. This man seems to be solely after money, trying to press out DVDs for people who expect a show on the same grade as Mr. James Rolfe's Angry Video Game Nerd show, with as little effort as possible. Shame on you! Shame on you for releasing this DVD! Shame on you for boosting your Amazon ratings by writing your own reviews and rating high. Maybe, If Mr. Bores started to think a little less of himself, he'd realize that this whole ""I Rate Gamer"" idea is the first step of his inevitable downfall.

2999495,1,B000X9LVQA,"Irate gamer is simply a rip-off of the angry video-game nerd, and i'm sure without looking at other reviews yet, probably every review here has already said that. It's pathetic that on this DVD, the review of TMNT that lifted direct quotes from the AVGN's review that was released a few months prior to the Irate Gamers have mysteriously been removed. Just like the ""No comments allowed"" option has been switched on to every Irate Gamer video upload on youtube.

Irate Gamer has the knowledge and creativity to make a decent video, well, when it comes to video effects that is, but when it comes to originality and humor, copying someone else and claiming you have never heard of them when confronted about it is what kills any potential you had at being a success story.

The other thing about this DVD, is it should have already been banned from the market and Irate Gamer should have been sued for copyright infringement. At least the AVGN explained that in his review of Back To The Future (NES) he applied to get copyright permission to use the short clips from the actual movie, but was not granted the OK, so they where removed from his DVD release. However, Irate Gamer, in ...what a coincidence... his back to the future video that contains clips from the movies, amongst other reviews that included clips from movies, have not been removed. And there is no copyright OK from any of the clips he used from any of the companies that own the rights to those movies.

So, buy it if you really must, but beware you are receiving a bad imitation of somebody else, useless bonus features, and copyright infringing material.",1289174400,15,1626,4.658536585365853

2999499,4,B000X9LVQA,"It should have been pretty obvious from the moment that the Angry Video Game Nerd videos became so successful that they would inspire all kinds of variations to the format and that they would inspire lots of people to have a go at the concept in their own style. This is what happens in television right here in the UK, the two main TV networks the BBC and ITV sometimes feel like they are playing a never ending tennis game between themselves with the amount of times they produce a derivative of each others successful TV formats, but is it a bad thing? with the competition between them, we the viewers just end up with more shows to choose from and everytime somebody comes up with a new concept the competition just has to up the ante, highering the viewing standard for everyone.
 With the Angry Video Game Nerd, James Rolfe created more than a set of video review entertainment shows he created a concept that would practically become a new video entertainment genre in its own right, so should we slam down hard critically on all those who use this concept to make their own derivative series? I think not, just be glad it is inspiring new entertaining videos for us to watch and entertaining is exactly what I think the Irate Gamer series is. I watch the AVGN and when I watch The Irate Gamer while it does feel like familiar territory, it is also a unique series of its own, I would concur that the ""angry"" aspect of it doesn't feel so natural in this derivative series but nevertheless I see nothing wrong with the quality of the jokes and script, the AVGN has been known to use some of the same devices that we see here.
It is a well produced, thought out series and while ultimately for me it would come second to the AVGN, I would thank the Irate Gamer for giving us even more reviews and content to while away our day with, thr Irate Gamer often uses newer games such as Sonic Unleashed so we are truly getting something alternative there.
You might be able to see the Youtube videos for free, but some people are like me they have a collectors mentality, if that's you then buy the DVD.",1281744000,4,2102,4.417525773195877

Almost everything from the disc itself to the content.

The DVD is just an really crappy burning one. And for some reasons this DVD didn't work on all DVD-Players, so to speak its cheap and poor.

But don't get me started on the content, all his ""reviews"" are blatant AVGN Rip-offs some of them are exactly word-to-word and picture-for-picture copys. But in a more cheaper way.

He always uses his stock footage explosion and doenst give correct fact, he is always reproducing wikipedia stuf but never give us REAL informations. On newer editions he has edited some AVGN passages out and dubbed it with other words. WOW that is pretty pretty shameful.

His production value is really really bad and low. The special effects consists of stock footage crap, which as far as i know is also licensed to anyone else.

He uses movie Footage like Back to the Future and doesnt give credit to owners of this franchise, but instead he is trying to make some money with this. DO i smell COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT

Do yourself a favour and avoid the Irate Hack and all his DVDs and bullcrap ""reviews"" there are plenty of other really good guys out there like th AVGN.

Thats the reason why I have heard of the irate gamer is because im a big fan of the AVGN and james rolfes videos, I watch all of his stuff on you tube and he gives us a great trip down to  the greatist nostalgiac memory lane and he is so hilarious and smart at what he does, but chris bores is just the opposite of all these things and I don't know why some people love and support this hack.

One of those ripoffs is the Irate Gamer. He's so terrible that I even blocked him from my channel on YouTube. His videos are THAT bad.

How bad is he compared to AVGN? Very. He never even plays the games he ""reviews"". He only acts like he's playing, despite that he has several hundred cartridges sitting on the shelf! Speaking of acting, that's another disappointment. He is bad at acting. No one ever seems to get to play a part in the show for some reason (Do you know why? Because I sure do), so he dresses up as another character, so it looks like he's talking to somebody.

This is all you even need to know to figure out whether to buy this DVD or not. If this review doesn't help, then go watch his sadistic videos for more info.

And to be frank, there is not much to talk about. Chris Bores ist just a horrible actor, a horrible writer and a horrible director. This production showed that there was almost no creativity involved in making the show, and you can just clearly see by the selection of games he ""reviews"" (the "" "" are there because calling this sorry effort a review would be really pushing the term) that he does not review them out of nostalgic reasons, you simply get the impression that it was the first time he ever played them while reviewing. This might actually be a decent concept for a show, seeing how folks from today, spoiled by fancy 3D graphics and HD Resolutions, react on games that have neither of the two and work on a totally different scale. The problem is: that's not what he was going for. I watched this DVD with a friend of mine who bought it at a garage sale for about 1$ (and in my oppinion, that is still 99 cents too much), and it was almost unwatchable. Sure, he may have put in nice special effects and all (what an effort, even I can put these things in with a decent video editor, and I don't even own a camcorder), but the rest of the show is just a disaster. It is poorly written, poorly acted (please please Mr. Bores, tell me that you are not trying to act in your show and that you just have poor anger management), and on top of all, Mr. Bores' voice is just so hard to listen to that it makes my throat all gooey just by listening to his throaty, muffled, mumbled voice. I can truly and honestly say that this is the worst piece of video I have ever layed my eyes on, at least the worst piece anyone ever asked money for. If I could, I would rate this whole DVD with 0 Stars, because this is not a D or D-, this is an F. F for failure. This man seems to be solely after money, trying to press out DVDs for people who expect a show on the same grade as Mr. James Rolfe's Angry Video Game Nerd show, with as little effort as possible. Shame on you! Shame on you for releasing this DVD! Shame on you for boosting your Amazon ratings by writing your own reviews and rating high.

It's pathetic that on this DVD, the review of TMNT that lifted direct quotes from the AVGN's review that was released a few months prior to the Irate Gamers have mysteriously been removed. Just like the ""No comments allowed"" option has been switched on to every Irate Gamer video upload on youtube.

Irate Gamer has the knowledge and creativity to make a decent video, well, when it comes to video effects that is, but when it comes to originality and humor, copying someone else and claiming you have never heard of them when confronted about it is what kills any potential you had at being a success story.

The other thing about this DVD, is it should have already been banned from the market and Irate Gamer should have been sued for copyright infringement. At least the AVGN explained that in his review of Back To The Future (NES) he applied to get copyright permission to use the short clips from the actual movie, but was not granted the OK, so they where removed from his DVD release. However, Irate Gamer, in ...what a coincidence... his back to the future video that contains clips from the movies, amongst other reviews that included clips from movies, have not been removed. And there is no copyright OK from any of the clips he used from any of the companies that own the rights to those movies.

This is what happens in television right here in the UK, the two main TV networks the BBC and ITV sometimes feel like they are playing a never ending tennis game between themselves with the amount of times they produce a derivative of each others successful TV formats, but is it a bad thing? with the competition between them, we the viewers just end up with more shows to choose from and everytime somebody comes up with a new concept the competition just has to up the ante, highering the viewing standard for everyone.
 With the Angry Video Game Nerd, James Rolfe created more than a set of video review entertainment shows he created a concept that would practically become a new video entertainment genre in its own right, so should we slam down hard critically on all those who use this concept to make their own derivative series? I think not, just be glad it is inspiring new entertaining videos for us to watch and entertaining is exactly what I think the Irate Gamer series is. I watch the AVGN and when I watch The Irate Gamer while it does feel like familiar territory, it is also a unique series of its own, I would concur that the ""angry"" aspect of it doesn't feel so natural in this derivative series but nevertheless I see nothing wrong with the quality of the jokes and script, the AVGN has been known to use some of the same devices that we see here.
It is a well produced, thought out series and while ultimately for me it would come second to the AVGN, I would thank the Irate Gamer for giving us even more reviews and content to while away our day with, thr Irate Gamer often uses newer games such as Sonic Unleashed so we are truly getting something alternative there.

But don't get me started on the content, all his ""reviews"" are blatant AVGN Rip-offs some of them are exactly word-to-word and picture-for-picture copys. But in a more cheaper way.

He always uses his stock footage explosion and doenst give correct fact, he is always reproducing wikipedia stuf but never give us REAL informations. On newer editions he has edited some AVGN passages out and dubbed it with other words. WOW that is pretty pretty shameful.

His production value is really really bad and low. The special effects consists of stock footage crap, which as far as i know is also licensed to anyone else.

He uses movie Footage like Back to the Future and doesnt give credit to owners of this franchise, but instead he is trying to make some money with this. DO i smell COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT

My favorite part of an Irate Gamer video is how he preys upon those sad AVGN fans that spend all day on YouTube defending their infallible god, who is secretly a shrewd businessman who steals money from his fans with crap products such as ""The AVGN Movie"" and ""Cheetahmen II reproductions.""

Grown men with fully developed brains (they have a developed prefrontal cortex, which has been proven in a 2012 Gallup poll that AVGN fans have a severely underdeveloped prefrontal cortex) such as the SomethingAwful community praise the Irate Gamer for his originality and controversial sting against ""stupid sheep AVGN fans that cannot have a meaningful relationship with a woman under 300 pounds"" (Gallup 2012).

A big indicator of this are the overall insights provided by YouTube. AVGN's most populated audience (Gallup 2012) consists of 4-12 year old boys that live in poor suburbs with families that make less than $1,000 a year, before government and scratch-off card assistance. Irate Gamer fans have a reputation of classy men that enjoy a riveting good laugh; 95% of viewers have a Master's or a Doctorate degree. I personally wish for a higher quality and understanding of life, so I personally choose to grow up and watch The Irate Gamer. (Gallup 2012)

In conclusion, The Irate Gamer is a genius who has marketed hate against a sad AND miserable group of people. A+

This guy's ENTIRE schtick is one huge, poorly-executed ripoff of the Angry Videogame Nerd (AVGN). It's just laughable and amazing that Irate Gamer's videos have so many views on YouTube. His early reviews contain sections stolen word-for-word from AVGN's videos (see the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles review and compare to AVGN's). After he got ""caught"" (it doesn't take much detective work to put it together) he actually stopped ripping off AVGN's reviews word-for-word, but still mysteriously happens to review a lot of the same games. Generally, Irate Gamer's reviews suffer when he writes his own material, because he is a no-talent hack. Even now that he's writing his own reviews, it doesn't change the fact that EVERYTHING else is still a half-assed copy. His personality, jokes, review style, and mini-plots within the reviews are all so transparently similar to AVGN. How anyone doesn't see it is beyond me.

Worse than the plagiarism is the stilted, hackneyed delivery of the material. Even when he's stealing AVGN's funniest stuff, Irate Gamer has an incredible talent for making it fall completely flat. He's a horrible actor -- everything he says sounds like he's reading off of a script. The ""irate"" moments sound forced and uncomfortable. Nothing here is funny, even if it might be funny on paper.

How has Irate Gamer responded to the accusations of plagiarism? By removing negative comments from his YouTube videos, and then finally disabling comments all together. He refuses to acknowledge or address the issue. Totally shameless. Do not buy this.
