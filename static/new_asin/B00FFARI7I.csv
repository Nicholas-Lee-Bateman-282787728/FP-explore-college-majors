5988189,5,B00FFARI7I,"I was 9 years old when Season 4 hit the air waves.  TV had better writers back then and the comedy was real.  I bought this mostly for an episode, second one on disk one, called THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC in which Mrs. Drysdale messes around with astrology and Granny thinks it's black magic.  Granny is rude to Mrs. Drysdale and runs her off but decides to go apologize to her and walks into Drysdale's house and discovers a miner bird which Granny instantly mistakes for a crow that the black magic has turned Mrs. Drysdale into.  Of course the bird has picked up Mrs, Drysdale's speech and Granny is certain it is her.  The hilarity starts from there.  Granny phones the ""critter doctor"" who is out and Jed comes in later when the vet calls back and thinks it's Mrs. Drysdale's doctor and is told to take her shoes off and get her in a cage and get her to flap around until her yellow feet are pink again.  Jed does exactly that!  Mrs Drysdale cries out, ""can't I stop now?""  Jed says, ""let me see your feet . . . Yea, they's nice and pink now!""

The mix ups in this episode are the hallmark of this comedy and really crack me up!  I had forgotten that these episodes are in color and they do have the original music score.  But I am surprised at how crisp and clear these turned out.  I swear on the big screen TVs we have today the picture is much better than when the shows aired in 1965.  The characters almost look 3D in some scenes.  Well worth the price if you liked these terrific shows when you were young. And I'm sure an unexpected treat for this generation that has never seen these wonderful yayhoos!

In 1969 Buddy Ebsen came to a mall near me and we got an autographed photo of him wearing that old hillbilly hat.  I think ole Jed had been in Granny's rheumatis medicine that afternoon if you get my drift!",1383696000,12,1818,4.238372093023256
5988190,5,B00FFARI7I,"Beverly Hillbillies fourth season

I'm glad paramount put out fourth Season of Beverly Hillbillies on October 1.  I bought this at WalMart and like it.  I think paramount should produce a first season as well.  I also think Paramount should consider producing seasons 5-9 in the future.",1382486400,7,286,5.0212765957446805

5988192,4,B00FFARI7I,"The long-awaited Season 4 of this series was better than I'd hoped for, but not quite what the ones From the Estate of Paul Henning were.  The color is beautiful, especially on ""Admiral Jed Clampett"", but the episode did have a scene deleted -- a small scene, not noticeable by those who didn't have the experience of being able to watch it in syndication before the Ted Turner years, when so many commercials began to be tacked on -- but even that tiny omission did irritate me.  And cause me to wonder:  does CBS or Paramount or whoever now has custody of the series even HAVE the uncut original episodes anymore?  If yes, they do the hardcore fans a disservice.  If no, this is tragic; even Petticoat Junction has been treated better than this.  But, as the best that we can expect from those who have never known how to treat the series, this DVD does unexpectedly well.",1382400000,6,874,4.5
5988193,5,B00FFARI7I,"It's a shame that the market has been flooded with umpteen collections of the same episodes of this classic show. It's for that reason that I'm afraid this collection will go unnoticed.

Finally, we get the 4th season - the first in color - and I couldn't be happier. While I haven't watched ever episode yet, the ones I have watched are done very well. I have already noticed scenes I haven't seen in years due to syndication edits.

Hoping that every TBH fan discovers this set and that we get seasons 5-9 very soon.",1382054400,64,518,4.442105263157894
5988194,4,B00FFARI7I,"Of course the four stars is for the DVD release; the show itself is five stars all the way.

Ok, I have watched all 32 episodes.  Shortest episode is 25:03, longest is 25:24, average length 25:15.  So I suppose that by the low standards that we have become accustomed to, these could theoretically be deemed ""complete"" episodes (another reviewer mentioned the possibility of the shows being compressed; I don't have any way to measure that, I'm just reporting the times of the episodes as displayed on my DVD player).  I found no significant problems with either the picture or sound quality; audio and video were very good on all episodes.

There are absolutely no extras to be found here, just the episodes themselves.  The packaging on the back of the DVD contains the following disclaimer (which you need a magnifying glass to read): ""Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions.  Music may have been changed for this home entertainment version"".

Despite this disclaimer, I found very little that suggested nefarious edits or tampering (and I tend to watch very closely for such shenanigans).  There were a few instances where a line of dialog appeared to be changed (the words you hear do not match the lip movements of the speaker), and perhaps a couple of instances of what appeared to be a hard cut.  But nothing obviously verifiable.  As for the music, the opening and closing themes sounded correct to me (same one I'm used to hearing).  Most of the music during the episodes also sounded more or less authentic as well (it actually sounds like the music used on Petticoat Junction, but of course that would make sense since both are of the same ""family"").  Only one episode (the very last, ""Jethro Goes To College"") contained some musical cues that pretty clearly are not authentic.

Unfortunately however, the episodes certainly have been ""edited from their original network versions"".  They have been completely purged of any traces of the original sponsor openings, closings, or cast commercials.  It really does rile me up something fierce (although it doesn't surprise me at all) that the empty suits didn't give us the truly, genuinely complete episodes, restored to their original broadcast configuration.  They could, and should, have done so (I for one would gladly have paid more for COMPLETE episodes that included the sponsor spots and cast commercials).  So I deduct one star for this failure (I actually should deduct two stars, but ok, I won't be peevish about it).

Having said that, if you are one who is willing to call an episode ""complete"" even though it is missing the sponsor spots and cast commercials, then to the best of my reckoning, this set is ""complete"", which, as my review title states, is probably all we can expect at this point from those who are sure they know better than we do what's best for us (how lucky we are to have them save us from those evil cast commercials featuring Jed and Granny hawking Winston cigarettes).  So you should probably go ahead and buy it; maybe if enough folks do we will see the release of the other seasons.  And sure, like all BH fans, I am glad we didn't get stuck with the horribly edited 20 minute network/syndication versions like some other shows that have been put onto DVD.  So yeah, ok, buy it and be glad for what we've got.

...But I am still p!$$ed about them cheating us out of the cast commercials.",1381449600,8,3412,4.76530612244898
5988195,5,B00FFARI7I,I reviewed this on another listing at Amazon.com but they are so confused I'm doing it again. I stumbled across this at Walmart Oct 1 for 19 bucks and LOVE IT!  They have the exclusive for some time. The opening to the episodes looks a little soft (this is a color season) but the episodes themselves feature brilliant color and crisp image. I was a bit worried because instead of 6 DVDs they've crammed the whole season onto 4 and I haven't checked the actual bit rates but they look good and aren't we glad it has finally arrived?  Get to Walmart if you want it and a LOT cheaper than folks will be selling them here.,1380931200,25,619,4.282051282051282

On top of that, because the episodes are not cut due to syndication, there are scenes that I've never seen before. It's like watching it for the first time. I can't get over the digital quality. After reading reviews of this set, I was afraid the remastered color episodes might look fake, but it looks very crisp because our tvs are so incredible now when it comes to picture quality. I can see makeup lines on the cast, which I doubt the creators ever thought we'd see.

5988325,5,B00FFARI7I,"Picture-perfect-- beautiful picture quality, vivid color; an extremely sharp, clean picture, thus BRAND-NEW-looking episodes.  Also, they have very accurate English subtitles, unlike Season 2 (which has no subtitles), which I'm currently watching also.

The only negative for this Season 4: most of the episodes this season have thin plots and aren't very funny or interesting.  The exceptions would be the two about Possum Day/Granny running for Possum Queen, which were quite funny.  Beautiful Sharon Tate, tragically a victim of the Manson Family murders in 1969, appears as a bank employee in the first two or three episodes of this season (and was in quite a few episodes in the preceding seasons, mostly in that role but also in others).  As to Season 4 plots: on the other hand, they are superior to those in Season 2, which as I'd noted above, I am watching simultaneously, and the acting is more loose and relaxed in Season 4, esp. from Max Baer as Jethro and Irene Ryan as Granny-- resulting in funnier delivery of their lines and overall better episodes, I feel.

Highly recommend.",1463356800,5,1092,4.972527472527473

5988385,3,B00FFARI7I,"Constantly Being Stalled (CBS) is sadly notorious for their shoddy treatment of their classic TV library; unless you are Captain James T. Kirk or Lucille Ball, you stand a chance of substandard treatment if you have the unfortunate fact of CBS ownership. Constantly Butchering Shows totally fouled up releases on ""My Three Sons"" and ""The Fugitive"" with music replacements and chopped up musical numbers in ""Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C."" Their treatment of classic television is legendary and not in a good way.

CBS has always seen their rural comedies as the red-headed step child with the exception of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" possibly. Starting with the ""rural purge"" of 1971 in which they cancelled ""anything with a tree"" in it, CBS has never ""cottoned"" to its rural properties. When the TV on DVD market came to fruition, Constantly Being Stalled did their thing again with this wonderful show. Instead of starting out with Season One, we were given Season Two. Season Three quickly followed and many had high hopes that Season Four and subsequent seasons would follow soon.

Four years after Season Three was given to us, we FINALLY received Season Four. As is the nature for CBS, both this and ""Petticoat Junction"" were given ""backdoor"" treatment and released exclusively via WalMart and it took some prodding to get our friends at TVShowsonDVD.com to even recognize this as a general release thanks to the shoddy CBS treatment. Hey, we finally had it! No more relying on 25 year old VHS tapes from local TV that were showings of well worn, faded out and scratchy 16MM prints or better looking copies that were butchered down for more commercials; these were going to be the best of both worlds-unedited and sourced from the original masters. As a lifelong fan of the show, I could not have been happier.

The episodes are pristine; you have never seen this show look so amazing. My understanding is that CBS did hi-def scans of the masters and even with down-converting back to standard def, you didn't even see the show look this good in its initial run from 1962-1971. The depth and richness of the colors are completely amazing. Wow! Jed's flowery tie, the ""courtin' parlor,"" the old truck and everything else shines through with a brilliance like you have never witnessed.

Ahh but enter CBS and their infamous cutting knife. The episodes appear to be complete as far as all that goes; there are no ""edited for syndication"" masters in use here. Constantly Butchering Shows has decided that in many instances we do not need to hear the original incidental music and they have replaced it with generic music that does not fit with the tone of the show. Constantly Butchering Shows is so afraid of music licensing that they have replaced incidental music! We're not talking chopping out a musical performance (something that could be a problem IF we can get Constantly Being Stalled to continue with the series as there is music by Roy Clark and Pat Boone in later seasons) but the background music that introduced a scene. For someone who is familiar with this show back and front, it's pretty jarring.

Because of their choice to do this, I have to give it three stars sadly. The show itself and the picture quality rank a solid five and I would even give it a ten if I could. Due to the decision to make jarring music replacements, I had to knock off a couple of stars. :(

So, CBS, where is the rest of the series? You guys claimed this season sold well, so what's the holdup for Season Five? This sold out on WalMart.com on the day you released it and I had trouble even finding a copy at local WalMart stores. Are you still that ashamed of a quality show, CBS? Get off your duff, Constantly Being Stalled, and get us the rest of this show.",1438819200,18,3745,4.701219512195122

didn't take long for my husband and I to watch the DVD set - we wanted to watch it every day!  The episodes are wonderfully funny....what
a treat for the ""funnybone!""  My opinion is that Donna Douglas as ""Elly May,"" and Max Baer, Jr., as ""Jethro,"" were two of the best-looking
actors on TV in the 1960's and early 1970's.  More than that, they had the spot-on talent to portray their backwoods characters to perfection,
as did Irene Ryan as ""Granny,"" and Buddy Ebsen as ""Jed.""  We also love Nancy Culp as ""Miss Jane"" - so fun to watch her ""eye"" Jethro in
a love-hungry way!  Raymond Bailey as ""Mrs. Drysdale"" was wonderful, and incredibly funny, too!  The best classic series, ever!!",1435881600,5,832,4.5
5988399,5,B00FFARI7I,"""Weeeeeeeeeeee doggies""!.Even though my wife & I only date back to when 'The Beverly Hillbillies' was in it's infancy, we really have enjoyed watching most of the episodes again. Like many Amazon customers though, we don't understand why only the first four seasons are available, when there were nine made. As neither 'Green Acres' nor 'Petticoat Junction' are available in complete series sets either, I think it might have something to do with the estate of Paul Henning, but if it's a money issue, I'm sure that heaps of each of these three shows would sell in large numbers upon release. Please release further seasons of 'The Beverly Hillbillies' Paramount, and make all three shows as boxed sets AS WELL AS in individual seasons! (To increase our options!).

5988430,5,B00FFARI7I,"From 1962 to 1971, I grew up watching The Beverly Hillbillies- a top rated show filled with top rated laughter. I am always so thrilled to see another one of the show's 9 seasons for sale on dvd. The show has finally made it to Season 4 and it's hard to believe that only 4 seasons are available on dvd now in 2015 for such a hilarious top rated show. Jed Clampett- the intelligent level headed head of the family always kept all the hilarity in check with reality. Jed's mother-in-law Granny (Daisy Moses) was the oldest, yet the one with the most energy who even at a ripe old age had dreams of romance and keeping her cousin Pearl's son Jethro Bodine constantly fed and disciplined with her favorite fresh cut hickory stick.

Jethro Bodine, Jed's nephew, was beyond hilarious with his 6th grade education, being the only one in the family who could cipher all those numbers and zeros, or as he referred to as nots. Having the longest education in the family, Jethro believed he could be anything with a 6th grade education- an astronaut, spy, international playboy, fry cook, general, movie star and the list goes on. And last, but certainly not least was Elly May Clampett- Jed Clampett's only daughter. Elly May was not only a natural born beauty, but as sweet and kind a daughter any father could dream of having. She loved her family and her animals (critters), but you could see that Elly inherited some of Granny's spunk with her tomboy characteristics. Elly could beat any man at wrestling, climb the highest tree, but her sweetness always came through.

I sadly heard the news of Donna Douglas' passing this week, the actress who played Elly May Clampett. Donna Douglas was born Doris Smith in 1932 in Pride, East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana. At her Catholic High School, Donna loved athletics playing softball and basketball. The real Donna was much like Elly May being a tomboy, yet absolutely beautiful. Donna's beauty was quickly noticed by the public as she won Miss Baton Rouge and Miss New Orleans in 1957. Donna moved to New York and immediately got jobs in toothpaste commercials, then on television shows. She was a Letter Girl on The Perry Como Show and a Billboard Girl for Steve Allen's Show.

It didn't take long before producers noticed Donna on television and cast her into movies. In 1959, Donna found herself in a Dean Martin movie drama titled Career, a bit part in Lil' Abner and in 1961, a part in Lover Come Back with box office heavies Doris Day and Rock Hudson. Donna was always going back and forth from television to movies. Donna was in The Twilight Zone, Ozzie and Harriet, Route 66, Thriller and many other TV shows. Donna was chosen out of 500 girls competing for the role of Elly May Clampett for a new television show in 1962- The Beverly Hillbillies. Donna won the role with her beautiful figure, gorgeous face, her tomboy athleticism and deep southern accent. Donna adored Buddy Ebsen (Jed) in real life as a father figure, just as she adored him as her father on the show. The night before Buddy Ebsen died in 2003, Donna and Max Baer Jr. (Jethro) sat by his bedside. The characters on the show got along so well, because they got along so well in real life as well.

Donna was married twice- her first marriage of 4 years (1949-1954) produced her only child- a son- Danny Bourgeois. Her second marriage happened at the end of the Beverly Hillbillies 9 year run in 1971 and lasted to 1980. Donna died where she was born in Louisiana from pancreatic cancer. She often went home to Louisiana to stay with family during the holidays. Donna was a gospel singer, wrote children's books, recently wrote a cookbook based on her Hollywood friends recipes- SOUTHERN FAVORITES WITH A TASTE OF HOLLYWOOD, loved gardening, friends, family, religion and made many public appearances- the last she would have appeared in 2015 in Michigan was canceled due to her death.

I am sad Donna Douglas is gone at age 82, but will beg CBS dvd/Paramount to PLEASE put seasons 5 to 9 on dvd for us fans! Having The Beverly Hillbillies complete 9 seasons on dvd forever is keeping the gifts of laughter that Buddy Ebsen, Irene Ryan, Donna Douglas,  Max Baer Jr. and the rest of the great cast worked so hard to give us for 9 years. So, please all of you fans, write CBS dvd and beg- it works if enough people beg! The last season 9 has Granny, Miss Jane and Elly into women's lib- leaving the men to fend for themselves in the mansion and the bank. Mr. Drysdale sends a Japanese Judo expert with 3 geishas to take care of Jed and Jethro and your sides will split as Jethro speaks Japanese! We must beg for the rest of the seasons! This review is dedicated to the beautiful Donna Douglas (September 26, 1932- January 1, 2015) who really was Elly May Clampett.

5988469,5,B00FFARI7I,"Zorro and Xena are my 2 cats, Xena is a female tuxedo cat about 8 years old, whose favorite DVD is a catnip video, where she gets to sit in front of the TV and chase birds, squirrels and chipmunks, when she's not in the backyard stalking the real ones, her favorite episodes on Hillbillies are when Elly May is by the pool with her critters. Zorro is a grey tomcat about 3 months older than her with a white mustache and chest, who is more into erotic video, so he likes to see Elly May by the pool in her swimsuit, he could care less if she was with her critters.

 If Zorro had the choice between Granny and Elly May, of course it would be no contest. Zorro felt there were too many episodes about Granny this year, Granny returning home for possum day, Granny and the possum day parade, Granny goes to Vegas, Granny buys a horse when she can't get a driver's license, Granny seees an ostrich and thinks it's a big chicken, Granny and the old folk's home, and on and on.

 Zorro would have liked to see more episodes about Jed, Jethro and especially Elly May like in the previous seasons. Zorro's all time favorite episode this season was The Beautiful Maid, where not only was Elly May by the swimming pool, but guest star Julie Newmar was also there with her and they were both in their swimsuits and he was really excited about this as was Jethro. And Xena was also interested hoping to see some critters by the pool.

So hopefully, future seasons will have more of Jed, Jethro and Elly May, because when Granny goes into her tantrums, and starts yelling and whining, Zorro takes off to his favorite hiding place in the basement under the stairs until the theme song comes on again at the end of the show.",1404432000,8,1710,4.33125

Actually I have already found there is an edit in the episode of ""Hoedown a-GoGo"". The band (The Enemy's led by Cory Wells, later of The Three Dog Night) play a small section of Pretty Woman by Roy Orbison.

5988489,5,B00FFARI7I,"Season 4 was the first in color.  And those colors are dazzling!  Gone are the washed out, dusty 16mm film prints that aired on television stations around the country for decades, with the accompanying tracking hiccups and blur.  These are crisp, uncut and beautiful -- the way they must have looked nearly 50 years ago on CBS.  The only music that sounds replaced appears to be that played by the rock band in the ""Hoedown a-Go-Go"" episode.  It's hard to tell for sure without seeing the original syndication version.  For some reason, the video on ""Admiral Jed Clampett"" starts out fuzzy -- almost VHS-like -- but clears up after about 30 seconds or so.  Also, it would have been nice if CBS had kept with previous ""official"" releases, by listing the original air dates next to the plot synopsis.  They haven't done that this time out.  Overall, a nice package.  But do yourself a favor.  Order this from WalMart.com.  As of this writing, January 9th, the entire season is just $19.99.

5988491,5,B00FFARI7I,"CBS/Paramount has done an amazing job here and great service to classic TV fans. They have taken the original 35mm picture negatives along with the high-fidelity magnetic audio recordings and digitally restored the entire Season 4 episodes of THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES to pristine quality. This is the first season of COLOR episodes and they look better than when first broadcast thanks to today's technology. In the old days, a composite print would be made for broadcast but using the original negative with high-definition scanning (and converting back to standard definition for DVD) brings about a beautiful picture. It is like watching an entirely different show seeing all the bright colors of the 1960s instead of old faded television rerun syndication prints and transfers.

Anyone who has watched The Beverly Hillbillies in color in the past will be blown away by this set. PLUS ALL THE EPISODES ARE COMPLETE. Someone posted a complaint that original cast sponsor commercials are not included but those of course were
not part of the episodes - they were COMMERCIALS - so the fact is these are full episodes looking and sounding like a million bucks. Really incredible and at a bargain price for 30+ episodes.
