2156614,5,B0004Z33DM,"Ever since I experienced the mild disappointment of Kenneth Branagh's film ""Mary Shelly's Frankenstein"", I had dreamed that someone somewhere would finally do a truly faithful film version of the greatest horror story ever told. I think I may have found what I was looking for in this three and a half hour long gothic melodrama. Most of Shelly's story is left completely intact with only some minor changes and additions. One significant addition is Victor's close bond with his teacher Professor Waldman (brilliantly played by William Hurt with a delightful German accent). This friendship is never fully explored in the novel. Another is Victor's ongoing hallucinations brought on by shock and brain fever. The novel mentions nightmares, but not hallucinations. Victor's childhood is explored deeper than it was in the book and presents us with a genesis of his morbid obsessions with life and death. It also fleshes out his relationship with Elizabeth. Another change is Victor and Henry's trip to Ireland, instead they return to Ingolstadt. Lastly, the part in the novel where the creature is shot after trying to save a drowning girl is left out. There are some other minor additions, but nothing significant enough to mention. So what we have here is something much, much closer to Shelly than even Branagh's version from 1993. It contains all of the questions asked in the novel, all of the dynamics of Shelly's vision, and all of the tragedy without being as over-the-top and bombastic as a Hollywood produced film. Now, is it a good movie? I admit I'm not a fan of Hallmark. Their films are far to warm, fuzzy and unrealistically optimistic for me, and I find many of them to be rather revolting. This is why I was amazed when I saw Frankenstein. Hallmark producing a depress-fest like this?! As a film, although it doesn't have the ""cinematic element"" of theatrical releases, I felt it is a far superior film version of Frankenstein than anything done since 1931. The acting is solid-to superb, the emotional element is there (I defy anyone who thinks they can get away without at least a lump in their throat after seeing this), the sets and costumes are excellent, and we have the best looking Monster since Karloff. Hats off to the makeup designers! By the way, Luke Goss steals the show as the Monster who only desires to love and be loved, but is driven to murder. Another thing they got RIGHT this time is that each time the Monster kills; he feels overwhelming remorse and is often driven to tears. Shelly's original vision of the Monster was a creature that was inhuman outwardly, but within, the epitome of Humanity. The Monster was never supposed to be soulless. He's portrayed by Goss as a noble and highly intelligent (if physically unattractive) Gothic Anti-Hero. Just as he was in the book. He even quotes Milton's Paradise Lost. A far cry from the lumbering, brutish, child-like killer we're used to. This film is highly recommended to anyone even remotely interested in the Frankenstein myth. And if you're like me, a major fan of the original novel, you'll find this movie to be absolutely wonderful. It's a shame that it received virtually no promotion and was limited to being aired on the Hallmark channel. Go get the dvd!",1098921600,160,3253,4.85251798561151
2156615,5,B0004Z33DM,"As others have said here, this is absolutely the most faithful version to the original Mary Shelley book ever put on film. There was, however, one previous version that also follows the book very closely, and was actually the most faithful until the present version. It's an obscure Irish / Swedish co-production made in 1975, originally titled ""Victor Frankenstein"" but on video as ""Terror of Frankenstein"". It's well worth checking out.",1097366400,6,438,5.183098591549296

2156617,5,B0004Z33DM,"Wow.  What a great movie.  Not only was it the only Frankenstein movie that came close to the book, it was so close I'm hard pressed to find differences.  Lots of the dialog was straight from the book.  It is at least as good as the book, if not (dare I say it?) better.  Great acting, creepy scenes.  Best bringing the monster life to scene I've ever seen.  It was gruesome & everything it should be, without being gory. I can't wait until Oct 26 so I can buy it.  Be aware though, that like the book, it is a bit less of a horror movie than a tragedy.  And it's so well done you can't help but feel melancholy at the end.

2156619,5,B0004Z33DM,"I just finished watching this 4 hour epic masterpiece and have to say this is the most accurate portrayal of Mary Shelley's novel yet. We have all seen Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee portray the Creature and although these are extremely classic in filmgoers minds eyes (mine included), there has never been an adaptation that has followed the events in the book so closely. When Kenneth Brannaugh originally announced he was filming ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"", I was very happy that someone was going to film the novel. Well, this turned out to be my biggest movie going disappointment ever. The reality is that I don't think anyone could ever film a worse version than that on such an overblown budget. Hollywood has always had a history of butchering probably the one of the most intellegent horror novel ever written...UNTIL NOW!

I had no expectations for this film due to the fact it is a made for TV movie. Considering it was also a production of the USA network, I had my hesitations. I just decided to watch it by chance only because of the name and was completely won over. From the very first scenes with Donald Sutherland as the captain of the Prometheus when he finds Frankenstein in the arctic to the amazing scenes of the creature's first breath. WOW!! This is incredibly powerful stuff. Not only are the portrayals and sequence of events true to the book but the laboratory equipment (which has always exceded the technology of the times in past movies) is what you would expect without being overdone. In my opinion, the creation scene is one of the most powerful ever filmed. I do NOT diminish the Clive/Karloff version in any way because that is truly the MOST classic but this is what you envision when you read the book. The only element that wasn't really played upon that Mary Shelley explained in great depth in the novel was Frankenstein's involvement in Alchemy. But with the detail to which every other element of the novel has been recreated, this can be overlooked. In the novel, the creation sequence is extremely vague, to say the least. This adaptation gives a very understated yet compelling portrayal.

On to the creature. Again, no disrespect to the classics, but the boxed heads, green complexions, bolts, and overly scarred interpretations are gone. The creature also has a very understated makeup that is fittingly perfect. Mary Shelley describes a being with long, black hair, yellow complexion, and sunken eyes. This is what we get!! Perfect!! Truly beautiful in it's  horror. The creature is portrayed with amazing pathos and intelligence. The scene of realization after he is chased from the house by the blind man's son and he looks at his reflection in the water is absolutely brilliant. When he beckons to God in regards to his appearance...I am at a loss for words.

Every portrayal in this adaptation is played perfectly and with great understanding of the novel. I love to watch movies with Donald Sutherland so enough has been said right there. William Hurt as Dr. Waldman is (do I dare say it?) brilliant. Mary Shelley couldn't have asked for a greater homage to her book. Finally, a true to life interpretation of a classic that in all rights should be considered a classic in itself.

I anticipate the release of this to DVD and will buy it the day it comes out. Don't hesitate, every Frankenstein fan should have this in their collection.",1097020800,48,3396,4.808219178082192

2156642,4,B0004Z33DM,"Full disclosure: Frankenstein is my favorite book - I adore it - it completes me (heh heh). But really - it means a lot to me and is very close to my heart. I wrote my master's thesis in English Lit on it and have studied it extensively. I can easily say that this film version is the closest to Mary Shelley's original vision as any I have seen. Sorry Kenneth Branagh (HATED that one actually), sorry TNT (and Patrick Bergen...cloning...what??) but this one beats you both squarely. Bolt necks need not apply. ;-)

Yes it has moments of exposition that don't exist, or that don't get their genesis from the book; there are some facts that are changed but don't really add too much to the story anyway (e.g. they make Elisabeth just an orphan child, not his cousin); some dialogue scenes have been added that don't exist in the book, etc. My biggest 'complaint' is that Victor shares his story with Waldman, Henry and Elizabeth in this telling whereas in the book, its his private pain/anguish. This seems more for the benefit of the viewer so that we can see characters agreeing with our own sense of outrage at Victor's bravado/carelessness, and its something I can live with - even though I loved the solitary nature in the book of Victor being his own tormentor (as well as the creature)....because he freaking deserves it.

But were I to choose a film to impart the general feeling of the novel to someone, this would be it. I'd always prefer people read the book, and I think you'd get more from the story if you did - but at least this film gives you the feeling of sadness for the creature that is the appropriate emotion. It doesn't, however, make you dislike Victor like the book does for me (can't stand the dude). He falls sick more than Aunt Pitty-Pat from Gone with the Wind.

There is so much to this story and so much to be learned from it - I HATE that the overarching opinion of 90% of the public is that the creature is some green guy named Frankenstein with bolts in his neck who is murderous from the moment he is created, that Igor exists (egad!!!) and that Victor is somehow a hard done by little scientist (boo hoo). The story can teach you way more if you focus on the story as it was intended. This film comes as close as I can ask for in a film adaptation.",1458518400,2,2283,4.379716981132075

2156645,5,B0004Z33DM,"This is my absolute favorite version of Frankenstein.  If you are seeking a version truly faithful to the book I highly recommend this one.  Please note, I do not yet know how good of a transfer this Blu Ray is.  I speak only from the original single disc American DVD.  About two years ago there was a two disc 10th Anniversary UK DVD with a horrible picture transfer.  Though it was wide screen (as it wasn't meant to be seen in Widescreen anyway) it was dark, grainy, and the contrast was too high.  It was a terrible new transfer and I sincerely hope that didn't carry over into the first American Blu Ray version as this is a film / mini-series that I love.

I just tested my Blu Ray of the Hallmark mini-series of Frankenstein starring Luke Goss as The creature.  This release of it was through Mill Creek (who also released a new Blu Ray of 10th Kingdom) and the picture quality is perfect.

Unlike the Kaleidoscope 10th Anniversary UK DVD of this version of Frankenstein this is not overly dark. On this Blu Ray the lighting is right and the contrast is just right.  The version released from Kaleidoscope a few years ago had horrible high contrast and some scenes were so dark all I could see were the actor's teeth.

Mill Creek however did this movie justice. The picture is clean and crystal clear.  The lighting is good and crisp and the audio is fantastic.  The sound is improved.  I can actually hear the specific words as Walton's crew men are muttering about mutiny.

I am very happy with the Blu Ray of Frankenstein from Mill Creek.

For a very long time I was on a quest to find a faithful film adaptation of Frankenstein that followed the plot and physical appearance, mentality, personality and articulation of the creature from the novel. A friend suggested I check out the 2004 version of Frankenstein starring Luke Goss as the creature. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised to find that it would be Hallmark that finally made a version of Frankenstein that actually followed the novel.

The film from 1994 actually called ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" was not as faithful as the title would imply. It had the creature bald with a distorted eye and speaking like a stroke victim. It also had Elizabeth's heart torn out of her chest and then brought back in the style of the Frankenstein creature.

For years after that I had searched for a version of Frankenstein that had a creature portrayed the way he is described in the novel.

First let us begin with the popular idea of the Frankenstein monster. Everyone imagines the creature as a simple minded, green skinned creature with a flat topped head, and bolts in his neck.

I don't understand the popularity of the ""simple minded"" Frankenstein creature. I know it was popularized over eighty years ago now thanks to Boris Karloff but think about it. In the actual novel the creature figured out how to dress himself (and that he'd need clothes!) in a matter of moments after his ""birth"". He learned to read and write (or remembered it) in a matter of months. That's equatable to an eleven-month-old baby with an adult reading level. He could read, write, was as articulate as his creator, if not even more so. He even had a favorite work of literature (Paradise lost). That's not a simple minded creature. That's a super genius in the making.  Even Karloff's version wasn't as simple as pop culture would have you think.  He was literally only a few days old in that film.  He was learning to speak in Bride of Frankenstein.  Unfortunately he was never shown as articulate and cunning as his literary counter-part until recently.

I'd like to see more intelligent incarnations of the Frankenstein creature but not pretentious (as he was pretentious in the film Van Helsing). For good intelligent incarnations of the creature check out the 2004 Hallmark version of Frankenstein staring Luke Goss, Ultrasylvania (web comic / graphic novel), the TV series Penny Dreadful, the graphic novel Frankenstein: Alive! Alive! by Steve Niles and Bernie Wrightson, and perhaps to a lesser extent (because he still moves and talks like a stroke victim) the Robert de Niro version.

Not only did this version (The Hallmark version from 2004 starring Luke Goss as the creature) have the creature physically look like, talk like, and move like the literary version of the creature but it also restored one of the novel's secondary morals. Everyone remembers that Frankenstein teaches you not to tamper with nature but Victor's biggest offense was never creating this being but that he abandoned him.  Parental responsibility is a bigger theme in the novel than the dangers of dabbling with what you don't understand.  The Creature was neer pure science anyway.  Victor also studied metaphysics, magick, and alchemy.  Also The Creature was benign until the world mistreated him, to pretend Victor's sin was the creation of this life diminishes his parental accountability and the accountability of those that mistreated The Creature.  Also many people forget that the novel had The Creature learn (a bit too late) that revenge was not the answer and that revenge would bring him no peace.  In my opinion this was in important a message, more so than the over hyped 1931 movie message of not tampering with nature. So why do so many film versions leave this aspect of the story out all together? Why are only the inaccurate or incomplete versions remembered?  It's not fair that this version of Frankenstein is almost entirely obscure in comparison.

This version captures the sympathetic traits of both Victor and his Creature as well as the morals of parental responsibility and the futility of revenge.

Here's where I am going to get a little nitpicky. It's a very good adaptation. The biggest changes deal with Victor's mother's death (in the novel she dies before he sees lightning strike a tree, not after). Also later in the film another body (after Elizabeth's death) is blamed on the creature in a village but it could be that someone died by coincidence that The Creature (happening to be there) got blamed for it. Oh, and The Creature's eyes. They're blue in this and yellow in the book (the TV series Penny Dreadful gets this detail right).  And Victor's father lives but seems to be going crazy in this mini-series / film.  In the novel he died.  But these are petty details. This version is probably the most faithful I've seen. And The Creature is VERY accurate.

The creature is the best thing about this film. If you want to see the creature the way Mary Shelley intended him to be, watch this version of Frankenstein. Admittedly there are a few dull parts and some parts that felt unnecessary as filler and dragged on a bit but this was the most faithful adaptation of the book and is unfortunately highly under-rated. Luke Goss is simply the best portrayal of the creature I have ever seen though Rory Kinnear as The Creature in Penny Dreadful does come in at a close second.",1455580800,13,6956,4.750623441396509

For a very long time I was on a quest to find a faithful film adaptation of Frankenstein that followed the plot and physical appearance of the creature from the novel. Just last week a friend suggested I check out the 2004 version of Frankenstein starring Luke Goss as the creature. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised to find that it would be Hallmark that finally made a version of Frankenstein that actually followed the novel.
The film from 1994 actually called ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" was not as faithful as the title would imply. It had the creature bald with a distorted eye and speaking like a stroke victim. It also had Elizabeth's heart torn out of her chest and then brought back in the style of the Frankenstein creature.

For years after that I had searched for a version of Frankenstein that had a creature portrayed the way he is described in the novel.

First let us begin with the popular idea of the Frankenstein monster. Everyone imagines the creature as a simple minded, green skinned creature with a flat topped head, and bolts in his neck.

I don't understand the popularity of the ""simple minded"" Frankenstein creature. I know it was popularized over eighty years ago now thanks to Boris Karloff but think about it. In the actual novel the creature figured out how to dress himself (and that he'd need clothes!) in a matter of moments after his ""birth"". He learned to read and write (or remembered it) in a matter of months. That's equatable to an eleven-month-old baby with an adult reading level. He could read, write, was as articulate as his creator, if not even more so. He even had a favorite work of literature (Paradise lost). That's not a simple minded creature. That's a super genius in the making. I'd like to see more intelligent incarnations of the Frankenstein creature but not pretentious (as he was pretentious in the film Van Helsing). For good intelligent incarnations of the creature check out the 2004 Hallmark version of Frankenstein staring Luke Goss, Ultrasylvania (web comic / graphic novel), and perhaps to a lesser extent (because he still moves and talks like a stroke victim) the Robert de Niro version.

Not only did this version (The Hallmark version from 2004 starring Luke Goss as the creature) have the creature physically look like, talk like, and move like the literary version of the creature but it also restored one of the novel's secondary morals. Everyone remembers that Frankenstein teaches you not to tamper with nature but most people forget that it also had the creature learn (a bit too late) that revenge was not the answer and that revenge would bring him no peace. In my opinion this was as important a message as that of not tampering with nature. So why do so many film versions leave this aspect of the story out all together?  Why are only the inaccurate or incomplete versions remembered? It's not fair that this version of Frankenstein is almost entirely obscure.

Here's where I am going to get a little nitpicky.  It's a very good adaptation.  The biggest changes deal with Victor's mother's death (in the novel she dies before he sees lightning strike a tree, not after).  Also later in the story another body (after Elizabeth's death) is blamed on the creature in a village but it could be that someone died by coincidence that the creature (happening to be there) got blamed for it. Oh, and the creature's eyes. They're blue in this and yellow in the book. And Victor's father lives but seems to be going crazy.  In the novel I thought he committed suicide.  But these are petty details.  This version is probably the most faithful I've seen.  And the creature is VERY accurate.

The creature is the best thing about this film.  If you want to see the creature the way Mary Shelley intended him to be, watch this version of Frankenstein.  Admittedly there are a few dull parts and some parts that felt unnecessary as filler and dragged on a bit but this was the most faithful adaptation of the book and is unfortunately highly under-rated.  Luke Goss is simply the best portrayal of the creature I have ever seen.",1351209600,2,4364,4.672323759791123

In fact the ""going too far with science"" thing isn't quite accurate either as the creature was created (in the novel) with science AND alchemy.  Most people forget that Victor ran from his responsibilities and had to learn to take responsibility, particularly paternal responsibility.  Some of his tragedy also came from not keeping promises.  He broke his promise to the creature which lead to the creature's second quest for revenge. The original story, and this film, also had the creature learn (a bit too late) that revenge was not the answer and that revenge would bring him no peace. In my opinion this was important.

2156684,2,B0004Z33DM,"I purchased this dvd thinking to use some short clips as a means of introducing the book to my sophomore English class. Based on the reviews listed here, I believed this would be a well acted and fairly faithful film adaption of the book. While it is true that the acting in the film is solid for a made-for-television-movie, this movie is NOTHING like the book. For those who have suggested such, I have to ask, ""Have you read the book recently?"" Having read the unabridged novel a dozen times in the last few years, I can conclusive say that the only thing correct in the film is that Victor comes from well-to-do family, is engaged to Elizabeth, goes to school, decides to build a monster which he later abandons, and said monster then proceeds to kill off his friend and family members. In this version, the 'secret' creation is not a secret. His professor, Henry, and several others all know about the creature-Henry even helps Victor pack up the destroyed female creature so Victor can dump it in the lake. The monster even uses a hotel employee to lure Victor away from the honeymoon suite so he can have a chit-chat with Elizabeth before he strangles her. Characters are in scenes that are not supposed to be there, conversations are held that never happened... in many ways this is almost an entirely new story.

The change of focus and content is alluded to given the subtitle, ""A Classic Tale of Undying Love"" which is completely untrue. Nevertheless, the story line does move along at a decent pace, and the film is both suspenseful and touching at different points. Consequently, if you are looking for a little entertainment, then this might be the film for you. However, if you are looking to find something more accurate to the plot of the novel, than this is is not the film for you. For the above reasons I've given the film 2 stars, although my students claim it should only get one.",1336003200,5,1902,4.594117647058823
2156685,5,B0004Z33DM,"**** SPOILER ALERT *****

This review reveals much of the plot of the film, If you don't want to know don't read further!

Pros:

The scenery, the acting, the costumes, the music are all very good.
The characters are believable. The creature (monster) is especially eloquent.
There are some unexpected surprises that make you watch a scene a few times before you quite catch on.
There is little gore, and the violence mostly takes place off camera.
The movie follows the book very closely in plot and spirit.
The movie has tremendous pathos. It is more tragedy than horror story.
The movie avoids gratuitous violence - remarkable considering the subject matter.

Cons:
The creature (monster) design and makeup - while following Shelly's description - is not sufficiently horrific to explain his rejection by humanity.
The movie is a bit long and somewhat tedious as it goes into very minute detail while unraveling a very difficult plot.
For horror fans, the movie isn't very horrific or suspenseful.
Luke Goss, while a fine actor, has a voice that is too high for the role of the  creature (monster), so he never sounds particularly menacing. But at least he doesn't grunt and growl.

----------------------------
Funny Things:

In spite of the tragic nature of the story, the movie does have some funny moments.

The scene between the creature and the little girl Eva is a funny homage to the Universal Frankenstein with a happier result.

In the movie: ""Mary Shelly's Frankenstein"" starring Kenneth Brannaugh and Robert DeNiro, during the creation scene, Victor Frankenstein (Brannaugh) takes off his shirt to show off his manly, hairy chest. Presumably, it is because the lab was hot (he is boiling water to keep his creature warm).

In the Hallmark movie, for some unexplained reason, Victor Frankenstein takes off his PANTS! Now what is that all about? He also wears some rubber boots (presumably to protect him from lightning since rubber is an insulator). But why does he have no pants? It is unintentionally funny to see him running around like this.

After the creature escapes Victor's lab, he runs through the streets - sans pants - and asks the local constables if they have seen a monster running about the town.

--------------------------------------

Review:

People who are used to the 1930's James Whale directed movie ""Frankenstein"", starring Boris Karloff as the Monster, may find this TV mini-series movie version by Hallmark terribly confusing or even disappointing. That's because the Whale movie, while a classic in its own right, did not follow Shelly's novel very well, in fact it wasn't even close. But, thanks to Boris Karloff's amazing performance (and makeup) as the Monster, we can forgive the pretty bad script in favor of cinematic fun. Karloff made the Monster into an icon, no question there. But that movie was nothing likes Shelly's vision and lacked her finesse and moral lesson in favor of shock and sensationalism. Still fun though.

This movie, put out by Hallmark, goes back to the source novel (written in 1818) and tries to do it justice. While it doesn't have anything particularly iconic about it, for fans of the novel and what Mary Shelly actually intended, it is a top notch winner. It tries to stay as close to the novel as possible while being cinematically interesting.

The photography and scenery are excellent, as are the costumes and sets, and the film approaches Frankenstein's creation of the creature/monster, not with the electric gizmo's and flashing lights we have come to expect in horror cinema, but rather more sedately with less flash, befitting the way the author originally imagined the scene to have transpired. For some, this may be a disappointment, but it is true to the historical period and also underscores the remarkably primitive conditions under which Frankenstein made his creation, and the subsequent pain it suffered as a result.

And suffering is what this film tries to show - as tastefully as possible - suffering of the poor rejected creature (who looks very much as Shelly described him in the book) as he literally limps out of the laboratory shortly after being born, and the suffering of Victor Frankenstein as he learns too late the responsibility he must face for bringing the creature to life and then abandoning him.

The film is at times, like the book, heartbreaking. And so, this film replaces shock and awe with pathos. In this, it is absolutely true to Shelly's amazing book. While Frankenstein is a horror story, it is also a tragedy. That is the take used in this film.

The Plot - (Contains spoilers):

Suffice it to say that the movie follows the plot of the book, opening in the arctic wilderness with Captain Walton picking up the nearly dead Victor Frankenstein and learning his history. Donald Sutherland plays Walton beautifully, being sympathetic and incredulous at the same time, just like the character in the book.

As Victor reveals his history, the film goes into something of an extended flashback of his childhood and growing up in Geneva to become the student of ""the unhallowed arts"" (as Shelly says). The film spends quite a bit of time here, which those anxious to meet the creature may find tedious. But it is important to the motivations of the character of Victor Frankenstein.

Alec Newman, as Victor Frankenstein, does a fine job in the role. He looks the part of a young aristocrat in the late 18th century, and he gives his Victor credibility, while remaining somewhat reserved. But this is what the character in the book was, a representative of the Age of Reason, not much on emotion, but deeply committed to his principles, while being at times just a little bit crazy.

Nicole Lewis does a fine job as his fiance, Elizabeth. Her role, while somewhat diminished, is the reflection of the character in the book, which was written in a time when women were more eye candy than people to be taken seriously. This was a pet peeve of Mary Shelly (her mother was the famous feminist, Mary Wollstonecraft), and I think she created Elizabeth to show how women were actually treated at the time. Elizabeth loves Victor and he loves her, establishing a relationship early on that is reserved, but believable given the sentiments and social manners of the time period.

Eventually we get to follow Victor and his education at the University of Ingostalt where he meets his mentor, Prof Waldman, played by William Hurt. The film takes some liberties with the novel in the relationship between Frankenstein and Waldman, but does so to establish a more solid moral base - from the Professor - because by now, Victor is succumbing to ambition and a fanatical desire to complete his bizarre experiment.

This was probably done for our benefit since the making of monsters is pretty common stuff to a 21st century audience. At the time of the novel, it was a horrific idea. What is a bit comical is that Hurt speaks with a pseudo German accent, while the rest of the cast speaks in UK English. No one knows why, and some have complained, but I am a Hurt fan and I found it kind of fun.

Needless to say, Victor soon begins working on making his creature. The film handles the construction with remarkable reserve, avoiding the blood and gore fest that could so easily have been done, for a more anatomically accurate (up to a point) display of body parts, including a severed head awaiting attachment to the the patchwork body.

The film follows the book very closely here and there is none of the nonsense about a damaged or even criminal brain. Everything Victor uses seems to come from ""standard"" stock. This is essential for the scenes that follow.

Of course, Victor finally brings his creature to life. The creation scene, like so much of the film, is rather reserved, but does contain the obligatory bolt of lightning to set things off. They do establish some tension as Victor leans over his unmoving creation and manages to ""jump start"" it by punching it repeatedly in the chest. One expects it to suddenly burst into life, but instead, with an eeriness, it does exactly what Shelly describes in the book. He slowly opens his eyes and looks Victor in the face. Not shocking, but there is a type of intimacy in this scene that is really, really creepy!

Victor immediately runs away in horror, just like in the book and the creature stumbles out of the lab to follow him. It was very moving to see the poor creature, played brilliantly by Luke Goss, obviously confused and in considerable pain, limping down the stairs from the attic laboratory out into the street, with no idea what he is doing, where he is going, or why.

A word about the creature's makeup is due here.

The filmmakers chose to go with Shelly's description rather than a makeup artist's nightmare. I think that was a good choice because the whole point of Frankenstein is the sympathy the audience must feel for the creature. And Shelly herself is rather contradictory in her descriptions. She says he is a towering 8 feet tall (something no movie version of the novel has ever pulled off effectively) and hideous, like a mummy brought back to life, yet he has flowing black hair and straight white teeth but black lips and dull yellow eyes.

Hallmark's creature is considerably shorter than 8 feet tall (although some clever camera work does give him some much needed height), has the elegant hair and teeth but grey blue eyes, not yellow. And his skin, well, it just looks like he needs a good dab of moisturizer to set things right. So he is actually a rather handsome creature, instead of the required hideous. Of course, he does have a few ragged stitches -- gotta have those stitches!

This choice in make up actually does hurt the film because it makes no sense to the audience when the creature encounters real people and they attack him in disgust and horror. Why? Perhaps he is too pretty? Can beauty be as shocking as ugliness? Nevertheless the attacks and abuse are close enough to what happens in the book and well enough done to make us begin to feel pity for the creature. And it is important that we do, for what is to come later, and what makes the story such a work of genius. Again, Hallmark chose to be reserved in these scenes, whereas a more shock flick would have shown serious wounding and bone breaking going on, with copious amounts of blood. This is not the case in this movie though and the creature escapes to the woods relatively unharmed as far as we can see.

The movie continues to follow the book as the creature seeks refuge by hiding near the cottage of the DeLacy family. For people unfamiliar with the novel, this is where that famous blind man comes in. But here, as in the novel, he is not a hermit, but the gentle father of a family of refugees of the French Revolution.

As in the book, the creature learns to speak, read, and write by spying on the family, and as in the book, he discovers that he has Victor Frankenstein's journal. In those days, keeping a journal was as important as telling-all on Facebook is to us today, so of course, the creature learns of his origins.

Now, of course, something HAS to go wrong, and it does, as it did in the book, but Hallmark adds a touch of whimsy to the pathos.

The DeLacy family have a little girl named Eva (she is new and not part of the book) and we see the creature come up behind her as she is counting ducks swimming in a pond. This is a real tension builder and a bit of a joke at the same time. It harkens back to the famous Universal Frankenstein film where the monster meets the little girl Maria, and eventually drowns her.

The tension builds as our creature approaches, but then is relieved when Eva sees the creature's reflection in the water and turns to ask him if he likes ducks.

Here is where the movie becomes touching. He speaks, and says, yes, he likes ducks. Of course, having been trained by the Universal movie, we expect his next move will be to toss Eva into the pond. Instead, she takes his hand and leads him into the cottage to meet grandfather! What a relief! This scene was so well done and touching, I had to rewind and watch it a few times.

The grandfather welcomes him and the creature cries in gratitude of being given food and kindness. This is again very touching. He even does a little waltz with Eva while grandfather plays the violin (in the book, he played a guitar), but the party is broken up by the return of Eva's parents. Her father, Peter, is horrified by the goings on and attacks the creature, who avoids his blows and runs away, hiding in the woods in tears, begging God to explain why he was created as such a monster. Then he remembers that Frankenstein and not God is responsible, and he starts off for Geneva, to confront Victor. It is a turning point for the creature, and soon to be a shocker for Victor.

Eventually, the creature does confront Victor, and now, he's not the gentle soul we had come to admire and pity. He's had enough abuse and is out for revenge. We learn that he killed Victor's younger brother and arranged it so that the family maid, Justine, gets blamed and executed for the deed. (in the book, this section goes into great detail about a corrupt justice system, but no Hollywood movie has ever dared approach this issue.)

The creature demands that Victor make him a mate to end his loneliness. Victor is of course confused that A) the creature is still alive and B) that he can speak and is actually quite intelligent, if a bit homicidal at this point.

They have a long argument over everything that has happened and about who is responsible for what, and it ends with a shaky deal that Victor will get his creature ""a date"" if the two will quit the ""society of man"" and live a harmless existence, at Victor's insistence -  in some remote desolate and uninhabited area. All compassion is that Victor. But the creature, desperate for companionship agrees and Victor sets to work.

At this point, we see what the creature, who is rapidly deteriorating into a monster, has in mind. He wants Victor to suffer as he has suffered. The first blow for Victor comes as he has to leave his family to make the creature's girlfriend, and he can't exactly explain why he is leaving. This causes quite the family argument and puts his own engagement in jeopardy. But a promise is a promise and Victor is a rational, if somewhat dense character.

So he returns to Ingostalt and starts work again. He is almost ready to bring his female creature to life when he talks himself out of the deal, after a conversation with his friend Henry Clerval. The once creature, now monster, (who never has a name) has been following his progress and enters the ""lab"" to see his new girl friend. He has so many hopes for her and the life they may share together. He talks to the dead thing as a lover might... it's very touching. But not to Victor who destroys the un-reborn female in front of the monster.

BAD idea!

The monster vows revenge and warns, ""I will be with you on your wedding night!"" and rushes off. It's important to remember that line, as it will come back to haunt Victor - and us - in a while.

Meanwhile, Victor has to get rid of the female body and takes it out on a lake to dump it. When he returns, he is confronted by the local police and the obligatory villagers and charged with murder. He is totally confused until they show him the freshly dredged up body of - not his female creation - but his best friend Henry Clerval. Victor then realizes what he's up against, and now has to deal with the rejection of humanity, just as his creation has. Clever monster!

Fortunately, Victor's father -  and insufficient evidence - gets him off the hook. His ravings about a monster make no sense, so he is remanded to his father's care, as he is mentally unwell.

Eventually he gets better, Elizabeth forgives him for leaving her and they decide to get married! This all happens in the book as well as the movie, and by now one has to believe that Victor is dumber than dirt, considering the monster's threat. This guy just cannot see the writing on the wall. He couldn't in the the book, and the movie is true to the book.

Victor and Elizabeth marry and go off on their honeymoon. He does know that the monster has something dastardly in mind, but can't figure out exactly what. He hears a noise in the inn where they are staying and locks Elizabeth in their room, presumably to keep her safe, and goes to investigate. He has inconveniently forgotten that the room has a balcony. Of course, the monster uses that to get in and kills Elizabeth. Victor hears her screams and comes to the rescue, too late of course.

Victor returns home in grief, and his father now rejects him because ""death follows you wherever you go"". In the book, the father dies of a heart attack. But in the film, I think they did this to complete the circle.

The monster has had his revenge. Victor is a social outcast, lost the love of his life, has no friends and his own family (what is left of it) has rejected him. The score is even.

There's only one thing left for Victor to do. Fight it out with the monster until one or the other of them, or both are dead. The monster leaves Victor a note taunting him to follow him and catch him for the final battle. Even though Victor has been laid low by all his losses, the monster is not satisfied that he has suffered enough.

He gets Victor to chase him across Europe up into the arctic circle, starving and suffering hardships and pain from the elements all along the way. They eventually wind up near Walton's ship where Victor is picked up.

But it is too late. The chase has taken its toll, as well as his telling of his story, and Victor dies from exposure and exhaustion in spite of Walton's care.

Walton can't believe the story but is soon convinced when he discovers the monster in the cabin crying over Victor's death. There is the obligatory final monologue as the creature explains his side of the story and his remorse and how none of this needed to have happened. Walton is not terribly sympathetic and the creature doesn't care. He takes Victor's body and carries it off the ship into the snow and ice, never to be seen again. But... does he die? We'll never know!

------------------------------
Conclusion:

In spite of its length and the complex plot, the Hallmark Frankenstein movie is a very fine adaptation of Shelly's classic novel. For fans of literature come-to-life on the screen, this movie is a must have. It is well made and deeply sincere.

The violence is handled as tastefully as possible, considering the subject matter, and it avoids the temptation to turn into a gore fest.

It does require some patience to sit through the whole thing (one could make a double nighter of it, as it was presented on TV) but it is rich in rewards - for it tells Shelly's story the way I believe she would have wanted it told, that is honoring her vision and keeping the lessons she wants us to learn.

It's also the best Frankenstein movie I have seen, a ""thinking person's"" Frankenstein which is what the book is all about.",1329264000,5,19117,4.617334905660377
2156686,5,B0004Z33DM,"This film is very close to Mary Shelley's original novel. It has a talkative, intelligent monster who learns to read and write by hiding from a family and watching them, just like in the novel. It has the monster kill Victor Frankenstein's brother William, while the servant girl Justine Moritz gets the blame. Then he kills Victor's friend Henry, and after threatening to be with him at his wedding night (after Victor's destruction of a mate for the monster before she was given life, which Victor initially promised to create for him)he kills Victor's bride Elizabeth.
Then Victor Frankenstein dies on a ship while in the process of trying to track the monster down to kill him.
The Universal, Hammer, and other Frankenstein films are entertaining, but this version seems to me to be closest to Mary Shelley's original novel. It is also entertaining and well-acted.
The monster turns to crime because of people's rejection of him because of his appearance. Unlike some film portrayals, he is not a mindless zombie, and he has no criminal or defective brain which would have made him destined to commit crimes regardless of how people reacted to him. This is also how he was portrayed in Mary Shelley's original novel.",1325203200,2,1220,4.898550724637682

Since enjoying the original James Whale classic which starred Boris Karloff, I've read the Mary Shelly novel more than once. (*yes, some people still read novels*) Anyway, of all the theatrical versions ~ of the book ~ none have dared gotten closer than Hallmark's ""Frankenstein"". Most reveiws here have covered much of it's plot and fine actors, but I simply wanted to give this fine film one of my personal aprovals. The creature's pathos ~ crossed with Victor Frankenstein's misguided obsessions ~ make for a splendid and intriguing tale. Frankenstein is so focused on carrying out his experiment to bring life from the dead that he doesn't even see the horror of his actions. Nor does he realize it's ramifications until it is all tragically too late. As a last side note I do want to mention the young actress who played the role of Elizabeth; Julie Delpy. Of all the many screen versions of Frankenstein I found Miss Dlepy to be the most charming and inocent of all the actresses who have been involved with that role. I believe she never got the full credit she deserved. Anyway, for a wonderful version of ""Farnkenstein"" I endorse this adaption fully.",1316995200,,1244,4.790697674418604

However, if one is looking for a film that captures not only more standout details, but the essence of the great classic novel, Hallmark's 2004 production surpasses all.  Although slightly marred by being made on a for-TV budget, which one expect, the production rises above the average production values.  There are notable performances, of which Luke Goss is the greatest standout performance as the emotionally torn Creature. a younger and more tragic than ever, the hearts of the audience break for the reluctant antagonist.  The major themes of Shelley's novel are intact, with references to Paradise Lost and the inverse parallel of the Creature to the biblical (and perhaps moreso, Miltonian) Adam and even Christ. Complex themes run throughout.  While certainly not being the most polished, this version is definitely worth one's time (even the three hours it takes to complete).",1297468800,4,997,5.167701863354037
2156699,5,B0004Z33DM,I really enjoyed this movie. I am not a horror movie fan but I don't consider this movie a horror film. I have not read the book by Mary Shelley so I really didn't know what the story is all about. I only have glimpses of all the spin off of the Frankenstein movie over the years and never liked it. This is actually a very good movie with a moral lesson.,1296432000,,355,3.9444444444444446
2156700,4,B0004Z33DM,"This film captures the spirit of Mary SHelly's masterpiece better than almost any film version I have seen, and it is a good bet I have seen most of them.  In many ways, this is my favorite of the classic monsters, the superhuman constructed by a scientist of genius, only to have his creation slip from his control.  Not only is it a warning (so typical of the Romantics) against placing too much faith in science, but it is also a deep enquiry into human nature.

This version of Frankenstein begins with a desolated man (Newman) lost in the arctic, unburdening himself to the captain (Sutherland) of a ship of exploration.  He was on a quest to resurrect a being from death, which had come to fascinate the young aristocratic scientist.  Though obsessed, he came from the happiest home, a perfect childhood cut short by the sudden death of his mother.  Once he creates the monster - here the film fudges the vagueness in the book by positing it is electricity that is the secret - he is repelled by it.  As in the book, the monster escapes in the coat of the doctor, which included his lab notebook so that he can re-find him.

The formation of the monster closely follows the book:  he retreats to the forest in extreme loneliness, rejected by his ""father"" and anyone who sees him.  For a long period, he watches a happy family, learning to speak and teaching himself to read; obviously he is highly intelligent, even sensitive.  When at last he approaches the blind father of the family, he weeps at the first kindness he has ever known, only to be violently ejected by the son upon his return.  This makes him murderously angry, forcing him to search out his creator (to gain a mate like himself) and giving up on man.  Similar to the Karloff character, it is clear that, had he been treated better, he would have developed in a completely different direction.  There is also accident, which further alienates him from humans and in particular from his creator, who sees him as irredeemably evil.  Once he refuses to create a mate, the monster declares war on him and the consequences are utterly horrific.  All the time, Frankenstein reflects on what he has done, how he erred into a god-like arrogance, which ruined him and all those he loved.  The monster is perhaps the best actor, who is at once evil yet full of remorse, full of blood rage yet capable of tenderness, brutish yet patient and cunning.

The only flaw in this is the weakness of some of the acting.  Newman, whom I loved in Dune, simply is not up to the task in my view - he is good but not great.  In particular, he fails to project a very complex relationship with the monster.  Hurt, as a German professor, delivers an unconvincing cameo performance, there only for the draw of his name in my viewing.  Sutherland is better, but again the character appears only occasionally, though his final confrontation with the monster - expressed as a moral argument - is quite moving.  I will never forget the image of the monster as he walks into the arctic mist carrying the body of his creator, to disappear together in the ice.

Recommended.  This is one of the best versions I have seen.",1295308800,2,3160,4.560283687943262
2156701,5,B0004Z33DM,"We have a problem here.  This is not a big budget film like the Kenneth Branagh version but if you view one and then the other you might have hard time picking which is the better version.  Alec Newman is not as good as Kenneth Branagh but he does a good job.  The Creature, played by Like Goss, is very good.  He does not convey hulking horror and neither did De Niro, but he does capture something of the spirit of the creature in the novel.  William Hurt's accent is hokey and he eventually loses it but his character is good.
My point here is that this is a really good effort that probably could have gone to the theaters.  It looks good, it sounds good and if you want to compare Frankenstein films it can stand along with any of them.
Keep in mind that the version that relies least on the book and yet is STILL the definitive Frankenstein movie is Boris Karloff's 1931 version.  Give the Hallmark version a try I think that you will be pleased.",1295049600,,952,4.2555555555555555
2156702,5,B0004Z33DM,"This is my favorite ""Frankenstein"" production because it is the most faithful adaptation to Shelley's novel. Some people might argue that the creature is too beautiful. There may be some truth to this. However, the creature appears relatively comparable to the earliest mid-19th century sketches of Frankenstein's creature. Therefore, the beauty of the creature is not an issue for me.

The film is DEFINITELY much more accurate that ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" starring and directed by Kenneth Branagh. THAT adaptation should have been entitled ""Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein.""

Positives of this 2004 adaptation:
-  Film is 204 minutes, which allows the plot to progress less rapidly than in many previous adaptations.
-  Film clearly shows how obsessed Victor was with his creature as well as the impact that the death of his mother brought to Victor's desire to creature life where there was once death.
- The creature has the ability to talk proficiently. Therefore, the creature is able to express its loneliness and is longing for acceptance.
- The creature does not seem inherently evil but rather a being that grows bitter (and hateful) over time because of the way he is treated by people, especially by his `father' (i.e. Victor).
- The creature definitely considers Victor to be his father in this film adaptation.

Significant Changes:
- Robert Walton (Donald Sutherland in 2004) is an elderly man.
- Frequently there are short flashback scenes to the arctic. [My Note: This can become annoying after a while.]
- Victor suffers hallucinations where he sees people who are already dead.
- Victor's relationship with Dr. Waldman is developed considerably further than in the novel.

Other Changes for those absolute loyalists [essentially, the minor changes that really do not matter very much]:

Film adds a dog named Bruno who is run over by a carriage.

Victor's mother (Caroline) dies of scarlet fever just before Victor leaves for the university of Ingolstadt. [Her illness was sudden and unexpected. In other words, she did not catch the illness from attending anyone who was ill.]

Henry joins Victor in the carriage on the way to the university. Henry plans to receive a liberal education in ancient history.

Dr. Waldman becomes Victor's adviser.

While studying at university, Victor sees another dog run over by another speeding carriage. Victor experiments on the dog, bringing it back to life for a short time.

One night while Victor is in the graveyard, gravediggers beat him up for apparently no reason except that he was in the graveyard late at night. [My Note: This scene does not make much sense, unless the scriptwriter is trying to imply that this assault is a warning from God for Victor to stop his desire to create life from death.]

Victor shares his success with Dr. Waldman. However, Dr. Waldman tells Victor that trying to bring humans back to life is wrong.

Elizabeth helps nurse Victor back to health.

The DeLacey family consists only of grandfather DeLacey, his son and his son's wife, and their approximately 7-year-old daughter, Eva.

The creature forms a relationship with grandfather DeLacey and Eva, both of which appear to accept the creature. [My Note: It appears as if the scriptwriter is trying to communicate that the blind and little children would accept the creature when adults who can see would not.] Therefore, Eva's father drives the creature away in a similar manner to that described in the novel.

Creature does not burn down the DeLacey cabin. In fact, there is no evidence to suggest that the DeLacey family ever leaves the cabin.

No townspeople ever shoot at the creature nor does the creature ever try to rescue a drowning girl.

Film conveys that the creature accidentally strangles William.

Victor tells the judge that he believes a large creature murdered William. The judge refuses to listen to Victor believing Victor is just making up a story to save Justine. [Note: This is a contrast to the novel, where Victor does nothing to try to save Justine.]

The creature observes Justine's hanging. Victor sees the creature in the back of the crowd. Later, the creature takes Justine's dead body from the scaffolds and tells her corpse: ""Forgive me. Forgive me.""

The creature sneaks up into Victor's room when Victor is sleeping and leaves him a map. The map apparently tells Victor where the creature wants Victor to meet him

Victor has an opportunity to shoot his creature with a revolver yet does not during the time when the two are conversing on the top of the mountain. It appears as though Victor's guilt is the reason for his refusal to murder his creature.

Note: The film does appear to also imply that the creature is born a heterosexual. Therefore, the film goes against the idea that the creature developed heterosexual tendencies. Because of this, it would be more difficult for Victor to consent to create a second male creature for companionship to the first male creature because the first male creature clearly wants a female creature and children. [My Note: It is still unclear to me why the children of this creature would need to be hideously deformed unless we assume that Victor has created a new species from the bodies of deceased humans.]

Victor returns to Ingolstadt to create his female being. While there, Professor Waldman visits Victor in the hope of preventing Victor from making a second terrible mistake.

Later, Henry also visits Victor. The film implies that Victor tells Henry everything about his past experiments. Henry tries to dissuade Victor from creating a female creature.

Victor burns his nearly finished female creature in front of his male creature's eyes. One can absolutely tell how upset this makes Victor's male creature.

Victor and Henry take the body of the female creature to a river. Victor disposes the body in the middle of the river. During this time, the creature strangles Henry. Victor is accused of Henry's murder.

Elizabeth and Victor's father take Victor home. Victor tells neither his father nor Elizabeth about his experiments or the creature.

Just before their marriage, Victor wishes to tell Elizabeth about his creature, but Elizabeth says that she does not want to hear anything bad about Victor or Victor's past until after they are married.

After the marriage, while in a country hotel, Victor is again about to tell Elizabeth when he hear someone at the window. Victor looks out the window and sees a hooded man running away. Victor thinks this being is his creature. He ells Elizabeth to stay put and chases after the man with his revolver drawn. When Victor catches up with this man, he discovers that the creature made the man run away as a deco. Victor returns to his hotel room to discover that his creature has strangled Elizabeth.

While holding Elizabeth's dead body, Victor observes the creature through the window. Victor fires at the creature through the glass window and then chases the creature from the hotel into a nearly lake. During this time, Victor is continuously firing at his creature. It is assumed that Victor probably has wounded his creature. However, eventually Victor loses sight of his creature.

Victor returns to Ingolstadt to see Dr. Waldman.

While in Ingolstadt, Victor reads in a newspaper about a monster terrorizing villages. Victor travels to the village on horseback where he finds the entire village attending a funeral service for the people killed by the creature. At this point, it appears that the creature has declared a war, of sorts, on humanity. [Note: This is different that in the novel, where the creature does not harm innocent people, but rather limits his vengeance on those Victor loves.]

As Victor dies, he hallucinates that he sees Elizabeth.

Final scene of the film shows the creature carrying Victor's body into the Arctic wilderness during a blizzard. [Note: The assumption is that the creature dies.]

FINAL THOUGHTS:

While some potential viewers might find (1) this production to drag on a bit, and (2) some of the minor actors to play their roles poorly, I believe that adaptation is worthy enough to purchase, especially if you can purchase it used for five to seven dollars. The adaptation is 4:3 aspect ratio, which also might disappoint some viewers. However, even with these potential negatives, I found the film worthy of my time. It certainly is the best choice currently available and really focuses on the scientific consequences of Victor's creating life.",1281657600,5,8486,5.0049751243781095

  I have never seen the intent of Shelly's story more distorted than in this pathetic misfire. It is a shame that I cannot give this a 0 Stars rating, because that is my true evaluation of it. To transform the monster into a happless, almost hansome anti-heroe was less entertaining than any of the cheepest of the drive-in dirivative trash that came before it. The creature's pathos has always been evident in all the most famous films of this story. This rapidly deteriorated into little more than a blatant sob story with blood. It is the only version I have ever seen that was bad enough to think of as boaring.
  In truth,I was not boared because I could not believe what I was watching. The two best actors in the cast were either under-used, or sleep walking through the entire production.

This one is a perfect example of those statements. If it hadn't been for the creature, I probably wouldn't have liked the movie. I could tell because I got a little bored waiting for the creature part to start. When he FINALLY showed up, I kept feeling like I had missed bits and pieces of the plot from time to time. I don't know much about film making, but I think maybe this one wasn't edited well. I wondered if the book was written that way. I still think the story itself is beautiful and I still think it was told beautifully in this movie. It wasn't as powerful as I thought it would be, but it was tolerable (in a positive way). I thought it would rip my heart out and make me cry for the injustice (and I'm easy to cry. I cry at TV commercials) so I was a little disappointed that it didn't move me more. Also, I think the story is supposed to be about Frankenstein not the creature, but it turned out to be the creature's movie...for me anyway. Even if I hadn't been a Luke Goss fan, his is the only performance I remember. The creature character seemed to tower over all the other characters. Again, I had to wonder if the book was written that way. Maybe I'll read the book.

It's the closest to Shelley's original novel; the few additions made don't detract from the spirit of the novel and don't distort (as Branagh's version does) her themes or characterizations.  What I love most about is that the creature is quite young and, while still horrifying, not so monstrous as to make us forget that Victor intended to create a beautiful being (i.e., you can see the potential handsomeness despite his sickly hue and a few visible scars).  His youth makes it easier to understand that the creature is initially an infant, despite his stature--one abandoned by his ""father"" and left to learn from the random persons and experiences he comes across.  All this makes it easier to empathize with him and to ask the question: Was it his inate nature or the lack of nurture that made him into a ""monster""?  My only real quibble is that while Donald Sutherland gives a fine performance, the difference between his and Walton's age and Victor's takes away from the doubling Shelley intended.

OK, a lot of this review sounds pretty academic.  Let me say that it's an exciting production of Frankenstein, very enjoyable.  My students laughed their way through Branagh's version and definitely thought this was the best one I showed them.",1233964800,18,1401,4.780082987551867

Frankenstein has a timeless appeal to it,and I've always welcomed new versions of the story.
This version is a very well crafted one made by Hallmark Entertainment(!),and is probally the SECOND most faithful version i've ever seen.(The first being Calvin Floyd's ""Terror of Frankenstein""(1976).
The scope of the novel is pursued and an emphasis is made on characters and dynamics,paticularly what makes Frankenstein tick.
Alec Newman makes a very credible monster maker,full of youthful ambition,and eventually sorrow on the horror he has unleashed.
Luke Goss looks effective as the monster,and inspires sympathy,but unfortunately,little horror.
The major setback for this production,like most modern Frankenstein films,is that while the monster has humanity,the horror is sacrificed in the process.
Frankenstein(2003) is rarely a scary version of the story.
It seems filmmakers fear to make the monster....a MONSTER!
That's something i'm glad no one told Boris Karloff when he played the role.
Still,Goss is effective,nonetheless.
The supporting cast is able,particularly veterans like Donald Sutherland and William Hurt(though Hurt's role seems somewhat inconsquential).
Overall,it's a fine production of the oft told classic,and reccomended for serious horror buffs and fans of the great classic.

Luke Goss' facial expressions and voice do a job of acting a sensitive Creature, whose evil side was only born in response to humanity completely rejecting him.

I thought Nicole Lewis did a great job acting the Elizabeth role.  This is a demure, saintly role, and some people might not like the degree of restraint necessary in this role as Ms. Lewis plays it, but I thought she hit it just right.  In this film Elizabeth is not one-dimensional, but shows some spirit and rightly wonders what Victor is up to. The Creature's encounter with Elizabeth at the end is one of the great tragic moments of story telling.

It is difficult for a video to fully convey the many and deep themes in the story, as it must show more than tell, but, strangely enough, my favorite version of the story is the new Frankenstein: The Musical (Music by Mark Baron, Book & Lyrics by Gary P. Cohen & Jeff Jackson).  The lyrics sing the themes to music that for the most part powerfully resonates the emotions.  The concept album is now out of print.  Hopefully a new cast version will be available soon.

It wasn't until I was over 50 years old that I learned that the Frankenstein story is more than the silly monster story that it had become in caricature. Now I believe it is a rich drama/horror/tragedy story.

Victor Frankenstein has everything, in terms of bringing happiness to one's life.  Yet he loses everything, in obsessive pursuit of scientific discovery, to which he then fails to take responsibility for the consequences, and so the consequences come back to haunt him.  Brilliant scientist, but poor on scientific ethics.  What a great story!",1200096000,2,1799,4.783171521035599
2156716,3,B0004Z33DM,"I am not ordinarily a fan of horror-type films but my wife is so, when we saw that this version of Frankenstein was a Hallmark production, we decided to give it a try. For the most part, we were impressed - particularly with the depiction (and performance) of the Creature and with the apparent fidelity to Mary Shelley's book. Much more of a melodrama with occasional horror touches, interspersed with bits of philosophy. The production looked good with the Slovakian locations especially impressive. Some of the first part did seem to drag a bit but Kevin Connor's direction was his usual reliable stuff. The acting, as often happens on these big productions, was rather uneven. I'm not convinced Alec Newman is a strong enough actor to carry a three hour-plus film. But Luke Goss as the very gothic Creature certainly got the viewers' emotions involved.

Overall, quite a good production. I'm glad we sat and watched it (in a single sitting) but there are a few irritating aspects about the production that would make me hesitate to sit through it again. The non-stop background music is frequently unnecessary, intrusive, and not very good. And Nicole Lewis's whiny little girly voice grew progressively annoying - so much so that we actually welcomed her demise. Other bits simply made me wonder: such as what was the great French actor Jean Rocheforte doing in this and why did William Hurt have a German accent when no one else did?

Still, it's probably the best, or at least most faithful, film version of Frankenstein so far. Entertaining without being scary. But there were still a few moments during its running time when I found myself wishing for just a tiny bit of light relief from Marty Feldman.",1180310400,9,1712,4.839590443686006
2156717,5,B0004Z33DM,"I am an English Teacher, and my students and I enjoyed watching the film. It did not contain excessive violence. The actor playing the creature had a very weak voice. The creature referring to Victor as father was creepy. It was a good movie. I would recommend it to other teachers.",1178668800,4,282,4.549019607843137
2156718,4,B0004Z33DM,"It's a little on the long side and the creature isn't quite as wrathful as Mary Shelley's, but this movie comes far, far closer to the book than any yet produced.  Much of the dialogue is word-for-word identical.

Why hasn't the real story of Frankenstein enjoyed the theatrical success of its knockoff versions?  Viewers have been reluctant to embrace a monster who is more intelligent and morally aware than Dr. Frankenstein himself--who feels deeply the crisis of his imperfect creation and subsequent abandonment, who compares himself at one moment to Adam and at another to Milton's Satan.

This version portrays all the creature's tragedy, staged amid vivid scenery and sweeping panoramas.  The naturalism, drama, and lingering suspense of Mary Shelley's classic novel all appear in this version; look for a PG-13 rating and a meager dose of the grotesque (i.e. no heart ripping) in this production.",1178409600,3,905,5.171232876712328
2156719,5,B0004Z33DM,"I agree with (most of) the previous reviewers: This is a very faithful version of Shelley's novel. There is a big difference between the 1931 Universal film and the book; both are classics in their own right. Kenneth Branagh, although a great director, missed the mark in his version. But this version (by Hallmark, of all companies!) have produced, in my opinion, the definitive Frankenstein. It captures the tortured souls of both creator and creature. Mary Shelley's novel was a 19th century novel that blended the Victorian age with gothic horror. And this film version approaches its story in that same way. It's perfect! Now if only when can get Hallmark to do the same thing with Dracula!",1154995200,5,695,4.898305084745763
2156720,3,B0004Z33DM,"About me, I am a huge fan of Frankenstein. It's my 2nd favorite book behind Paradise Lost.

A lot of people have mentioned how this film is so close to the book...I disagree entirely, but rather than slant their opinions I'll just point out some differences:
1. Henry Clerval does not go to Ingolstadt with Victor until after the creation.
2. The monster's murder of William Frankenstein was malicious and was strangling around the neck, not the accidental covering of the mouth turned suffocation in th is version.
3. Justine does not confess to the murder in the book, and she is put on trial in the book, not just dragged out of the cell and hung by a mob.
4. The monster does not recognize William as a Frankenstein from his eyes...the boy has a locket of Victor around his neck when the creature finds him.
5. Lots of attack scenes in this movie between the creature and Frankenstein that never occur in the book.
There are more, but anyways.
  Etc.  (I won't go on, these are all in the first hour.)

That being said, the main characters do an excellent job. Luke Goss is the closest monster to Mary Shelley's there is. He does a wonderful job portraying the monster's depressing, lonely side. Victor also does well, nothing spectacular, but a good job.
The extras are a different story...the mob chase scene is hilarious...its about 40 peasants walking next to the creature with rakes waving tools at it. It will make you laugh when you see it, or get mad because it just interrupts any enthrallment you may have had with the movie. The old man that plays the blind DeLacey (to me) is blatantly using his eyes in his performance. The most unbelievable blind man I've ever seen in a movie.

Con: It is a 3 and a half hour movie that doesn't really get you involved.

Pro: Luke Goss is the creature that Mary Shelley created. That being said the movie is a TRAGEDY, not scary at all. Mary Shelley didn't mean for it to be a horror, but if you're looking for a scary movie this is not it.

2156722,4,B0004Z33DM,"Another classic from Hallmark, beautiful to watch -and to watch again and again that is!

Frankensteins' Monster here looks as grotesque as ever, though a bit different than the usual ""outfit"" feautered in the previous movies about the Shelley-creature. The acting generally works very well, the locations and camera-work could not have been better.

""Frankenstein"" is a TV-movie, keep that in mind when you see it, but I find it just as good (if not even better) than the De Niro-version from a few years back.

Also keep in mind that this is not a scary-movie, it is the story of the tragic fate of a creature ""born"" (or placed) into this world only to be feared, doomed to a live a life in loneliness -only wanting to be loved.

The monster is no zombie, not ""born"" evil -but it becomes a ""result"" of human beings fear of the unknown, yes well -Hallmarks' new classic is highly recommended.",1108684800,4,893,4.632911392405063

A drama of one man's attempt to play God, then abandon the one he had forged in order to escape the consequences of his actions.  Yet, the living and breathing creature Victor Frankenstein helps bring to life will not allow him to simply forget.

""Man or Monster"" was the under-title of the series.  One has to wonder who was the man and who was the monster.  The one who sought to play god, then abandoned his creation, going as far as deciding to kill him before any such murder had even taken place?

Or is it the one who longed for love and acceptance, and only after this is denied does he seek vengeance on the father who thought so little of him, to help bring him to life as a mere experiment, without realizing he was something more?",1099526400,8,773,4.333333333333333

Frankenstein has been my favorite novel since I was 12, I have seen every version that I have been able to get my hands on, and none of them are as good as this one! (Although don't get me wrong, Boris Karloff and Colin Clive did an excellent job in the 1931 version.)  This is the way that Mary Shelley intended Frankenstein to be.  Luke Goss is absolutely amazing!  I would recommend this to anyone who has read the book and subsequently seen the movies and been disappointed (like Kenneth Brannagh's--which wasn't half bad until the ridiculous ending...and the fact that Brannagh himself stared in it when he was way older than Victor Frankenstein should have been.)  It is unfortunate that there was not a great deal of advertising for this movie; I just happened onto it while flipping through the channels.",1099094400,12,914,4.7594936708860756
2156727,5,B0004Z33DM,"FRANKENSTEIN is a three and a half hour epic that recreates Mary Shelley's classic tale of the dichotomy of science vs humanities in a keenly wrought script by Mark Kruger.  For all its length and emphasis on special effects, sets, costumes, flashbacks etc, this film produced by Hallmark for television proves its mettle when viewed non-stop on the recently released DVD.

Director Kevin Connor wisely emphasizes the morality issues in Shelley's novel and does not opt for the usual so-weird-that-it-becomes-comical focus on the manmade monster (a sensitive Luke Goss) of Dr. Frankenstein (Alec Newman). Through a series of flashbacks (the tale opens with on an ice-stranded ship captained by a man (Donald Sutherland) in search of his own scientific truths.  Enter Dr. Victor Frankenstein, ill from his pursuit of the monster he created in his German laboratory under the tutelage of Professor Waldman (William Hurt).  The film flashbacks to Victor's childhood and the impact of the death of his mother (Julie Delphy) that drives Victor to understand 'death' in hopes of being able to reverse it.  We meet his adopted sister Elizabeth (Nicole Levin) who is later to become his love and his wife, and his childhood friend Henry (Dan Stevens) who will follow Victor through the trials of his life.

With tremendous veracity we see Victor's motivation to overcome death in a laboratory that is not eerie but wonderfully life-affirming, a place where he restores life to frogs and dogs killed by accidents.  Victor becomes obsessed with his work and eventually creates a 'man' from the body parts of the dead laying in open graves in the paupers' graveyard.  Using the electrical current from lightning he brings his creature to life - and from this point on the error of his creation pursues him.

The 'monster' is not the freak usually displayed, but a tender soul, hungry for love, for family, for tenderness.  His outward appearance creates the 'bad monster' in the eyes of the public and the monster begins a course of killings, all in response to his need to have his 'father' (Dr Frankenstein) provide a love object/source for him.

Yes, the story and its conclusion are known to everyone. The difference here is the view that man must take responsibility for all his actions and that ignoring the emotional needs of anyone is committing a crime.  All of the actors are excellent, the period evocation is elegant, and the special effects are subtly handled.  Connor has a hard time making his crowd scenes credible: his cast of extras seems to be gathered from people who have no clue how to act.  But given the flaws in a movie too long for one sitting, this film manages to be true to the reasons Mary Shelley wrote this book, a book that is among the most famous ever written.  This is a FRANKENSTEIN that cares more about character motivation than being a fright Halloween film.",1099008000,59,2887,4.899383983572895
