8181884,3,B000NVLGNG,"The performances were all very nice, however, it was not at the same quality as an IAMED performance dvd, which is okay, just good to know.  The performances were kept short, and the dvd seemed a little short.  I loved Mira's performance.  I'm looking forward to more dvd's from them in the future.",1188604800,,298,4.584905660377358
8181885,5,B000NVLGNG,BDSS has nothing on you! I wish I had ordered this instead.  The dancers are very real and not so made up that you forget what your looking at.  I love the classical spin on everything that was done and the fact that not everyone is a size 6.  If this group ever toured the U.S. I think you'd give BDSS a run for their money.  Wonderful and I hope to see more soon!!!,1187136000,,367,3.918918918918919
8181886,5,B000NVLGNG,"This is one of the best performance dvds I've ever seen. The dancers controlled the editing so the angles are perfect, making it possible to see the choreographies from the feet up! Thankfully there are none of those goofy MTV style cuts and wacky camera angles that are so prevalent in other dvds. Great dancers, beautiful costumes and wonderful performances. Bravo!!!!!",1185321600,11,371,5.098360655737705
8181887,5,B000NVLGNG,My wife and I are always looking for fun ways to spice up our marriage. I bought this sort of as a joke and to my surprise my wife loved it! It's helped us renew our interest in each other and I am looking forward to buying her volume 3!!!!!,1184889600,,241,3.84
8181888,4,B000NVLGNG,"This is a great video for dancers!  All the dancers have beautiful costumes and look professional, and the sets are nice without interfering with the enjoyment of the dance.  Some of my favorite dancers are on this DVD: Zaheea and Sandra!  I also learned about some new dancers that are now on my list to watch.  The music was well-selected and there wasn't a single performance that made me cringe (cannot say the same for some other recent releases).  Because the videography was geared towards making the dance easy to watch, it was very easy to take in the whole performance.  The camera did not linger on the face or just one part of the body, but instead showed the whole body.  At the same time, perspectives did change to make it interesting.",1184112000,14,750,4.593984962406015
