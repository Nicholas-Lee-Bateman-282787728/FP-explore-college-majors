8114464,3,B000EU69GU,"Be cautioned that the ""Dancing on Ice"" series is  PAL/Region 2 . Viewers in the U.S.A. must not only have a disc player that can convert from the European ""PAL"" format to the North American ""NTSC"" system(many Denon & Oppo players can do this), but, because the manufacturer of this disc series insists on using the unreasonable region coding tactic(to block the disc from being played outside of Western Europe & Southeast Asia), you must have a modified player that can ignore region coding(I do have machines that are modified). Do a search on the internet for ""Region-Free"" or ""Code-Free"" DVD & Blu-Ray players.

""Dancing on Ice"" is a successful British T.V. series which is a skating with celebrities competition. Some highly athletic British celebrities go through a 12-week ""Crash"" course with Olympic gold medal ice dancers Torvill & Dean, then these celebrities are each paired with a professional skater to perform in a weekly ice dance competition, including occasional wire harness performances. The semi-finalists try to replicate Torvill & Dean's Olympic gold medal-winning ""Bolero"" choreography.

Torvill and Dean have taken the cast of ""Dancing on ice"" on tour several times, and Universal/UK have released DVD's of these tours. These discs are also region coded. If you want to spend the money on a modified DVD or Blu-Ray player, and you like skating videos, then you'll like the ""Dancing on Ice"" DVD series. I've got all the discs, and I can play them.......Whether ITV Video or Universal Video like it or not!",1379635200,2,1528,5.055555555555555
