8241458,4,B0011DZDPC,"This is a good look at Erwin Rommel's life. It is limited by it's duration, yet it certainly informs the viewer of Rommel's legendary exploits in both World Wars. It is a nice addition to add to one's collection of material on the life  of Rommel. Also, it can be very helpful to someone looking for a cursory explanation of the Desert Fox's place in history. Easy to understand and informative.",1313884800,3,395,4.563380281690141
8241459,5,B0011DZDPC,"I enjoyed this documentary immensely!  It shows how Erwin Rommel's blitzkrieg tactics and his leading the ""ghost division"" in France helped Nazi Germany conquer all of western Europe.  It also shows Rommel's falling out with Hitler due to Hitler's intransigence on many issues, especially resupplying his forces in North Africa.  Evnetually Rommmel commits suicide (or is forced to by Hitler) because of his knowledge of the July bomb plot by Stauffenberg.  Overall, very interesting documentary about how even intelligent people can be used for bad purposes by maniacal leaders.",1302134400,5,579,5.47191011235955
8241460,4,B0011DZDPC,"Heroes are oft found in the most unlikely places.  It seems counter-intuitive that a hero might be found within the vile Nazi state military but there he is, as the title implies, like the proverbial noble knight.  A gem buried in the rough of Nazi terror.  Through his life Rommel attempted to balance virtue in arms with private political dissension.  In the end, it cost him his life.  Sadly, the world knows so few that have valued personal honor and integrity as did General Rommel.  The world, much less the Nazi regime, was not worthy of him.  This is a wonderful portrayal of a noble gentleman and a must see for any wishing to understand the dilemma of being good in an empire that has gone mad with hate.",1247443200,11,714,4.488372093023256
