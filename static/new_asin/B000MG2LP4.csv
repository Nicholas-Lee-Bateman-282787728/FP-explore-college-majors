2729853,5,B000MG2LP4,Romola Garai is a wonderful actress. I can't believe she isn't a huge star. I love Alex O'Loughlin also. He is an excellent actor as well as being cute and sexy. The story line was interesting and held your interest.,1206835200,2,216,4.425
2729854,4,B000MG2LP4,"Based on a true story, this movie is about an Englishwoman who was sent to what became the very first penal colony in New South Wales (Australia). The hardships were more realistically depicted than in most stories of this type.  Along the way she finds loves and endures even greater hardships, in her quest for freedom. Highly recommend, but not for anyone under 18.",1203292800,51,368,4.75
2729855,5,B000MG2LP4,"An excellent movie based on real life accounts of Mary Bryant.  I originally  bought the DVD because of other actors in the movie, but Romola Garai was wonderful as Mary Bryant.  It is a very touching story about a poor,young woman arrested for stealing food and sentenced to a life of hard labor in a colony in New Zealand. It is a story of a woman's indomitable spirit and determination to live free.  A must see!",1199232000,5,415,4.421052631578948
2729856,3,B000MG2LP4,"[At the request of a commenter let me preface this with SPOILER WARNING -- if you would be wanting to see this movie for the plot only, don't keep reading.  For those who have some idea of the history and won't be surprised by it -- or who are more interested in it for the history and not mere entertainment, you are safe to proceed.]

I wanted to love this movie... I really, really wanted to love this movie.  Sadly, I don't.

FIrst I would agree with the previous reviewers that they went overboard in showing nudity, sex and violence (particularly the sexual violence).  I had planned on watching this as a family because a review elsewhere had raved about it's educational value.  I'm not sure, having seen it, where that came from.

It raises good questions for the conservatives amongst us -- what would you be willing to do for your freedom?  What extremes would you go to in order to save your family?  Considering the mixed outcome (Mary survives but her husband and children do not), it doesn't give you easy answers.  It raises questions about hubris, about reaching or striving too far... what if they had settled somewhere?  How long would they have gotten along if they had?

It does show something of the deplorable conditions people have been forced to live through (my ex husband's father's brothers were picked up on the streets of Dublin, according to witnesses having done nothing wrong, sent off to Australia by the British and never heard from again.  It raises new questions and appreciation for me of what they went through.)

While you can argue that the graphic depiction is to make a point, it was not necessary -- my 17-year-old son asked me numerous times to please fast forward because he didn't want to watch these sorts of things.  (More power to him.)  The characters could have been more developed.  While Mary is a strong character, she comes off somewhat 2-dimensional.  We never learn enough of her to understand her motivation to risk so much... we learn less of the other characters.  In particular the man Mary has the affair with in order to procure needed items is left a shell of a man, and her interactions with him so obvious that even a desperate man of limited intelligence, no matter what part of his anatomy he was thinking with, would have been able to see right through them.

The story is remarkable, the cast is good, the screenplay left much to be desired and I would say the directing did as well... it could have been, should have been, so much more.",1198281600,9,2508,4.6058558558558556
2729857,5,B000MG2LP4,"If you are a history buff or a fan of Alex O'Loughlin and Jack Davenport, this movie is a MUST HAVE for your collection.

This movie is based on the real life story of Mary Bryant, who was one of the first prisoners sent to Australia.  It skims over this and that, but does a good job of telling the story.

Alex O'Louglin plays William Bryant, Mary's husband and Jack Davenport plays Lieutenant Ralph Clarke, who stives as much for Mary's attentions as for justice for the convicts.

The scenery in this movie is beautiful and the story hooks you in for wanting more.",1197072000,,568,4.4326923076923075
2729858,5,B000MG2LP4,"A gripping drama about a woman's strength and fortitude of survival. The Journey of Mary Bryant is about a woman who is arrested for stealing food due to starvation and is sentenced to serve time in the penal colony Botany Bay. Faced with numerous obstacles, she has the courage and audacity to take control. Magnificent drama and what lengths a person will go to survive.",1196208000,,372,4.7384615384615385
2729859,4,B000MG2LP4,"First off, if you're thinking that this is going to be another british type period drama with just a hint of realism, this isn't the series for you.  Some scenes are VERY graphic and sometimes painful to watch (a woman is severely whipped for an offense while aboard ship....chaos reigns when the prisoners finally arrive in Botany Bay -- rape and violence).  The conditions aboard ship while on the way to Australia are horrendous and graphicly shown.  In other words, this is not a series for the faint fo heart.  As for why the film makers felt the need to show such scenes, I can only surmise that they wanted the audience to experience at least a part of what these prisoners lived through.

Warnings aside, I have to say that I enjoyed the series as a whole.  The actors involved were tremendous, especially Romola Garai (Mary Bryant) and Jack Davenport (Lt. Clarke).  Romola managed to make me both hate and yet feel compassion for her character; a hard feat indeed.  Mary, is manipulative to the extreme.  She fought with everything she had in order to insure the survival of her children, her husband (fellow prisoner played by Aussie Alex O'Loughlin) and herself.  The object of most of that manipulation is one Lt. Clarke, a man most certainly out of his depth and obsessed with Mary.

My one and only criticism of the series is that because of the way that certain scenes were shot and edited, you almost feel as if you should be rooting for Mary to end up with Clarke instead of the husband.

Overall, a definitely worthwhile viewing.  High production values and beautifully shot.  But be warned, this is most certainly not for the faint fo heart.",1190937600,88,1660,4.65979381443299
2729860,4,B000MG2LP4,"I could almost smell the stench in the ship's prisoners' hold.  Romola Garai, the stunning beauty of Daniel Deronda, looks more natural here, smeared with muck and dressed in rags.  Her character is a bit hard to believe (she'll do anything to survive, and pulls off amazing feats) and I wasn't always rooting for her.  But better her than the horrible English officers.  They were either uptight prudes who could severely whip a woman or ambitious snobs who could watch as prisoners get brutally raped.  Some of the escape scenes were extremely tense, and the production values were good.  I recommend this for those with strong stomachs and a love of historical drama.",1183939200,8,670,4.884955752212389
2729861,4,B000MG2LP4,Truly amazing story done with realism and great acting. I would've given it 5 stars except for the incredibly graphic (and needless) depictions of sex acts.,1183593600,8,156,5.038461538461538
2729862,3,B000MG2LP4,"This was a truly passionate film about one woman's journey to freedom: Mary Bryant, who was transported to a penal colony in Australia for stealing (just once) out of desperation & hunger.  Mary Bryant, played superbly by Romola Garai, must do unthinkable things in order to survive the harsh world she now finds herself in. The action in this film is intense and rarely lets up...

Please be aware that the content of this film is an R: there is disturbing violence (including sexual violence), nudity, sex and more.  This one was a bit of a hard one to watch, as the content was very strong and intense.  However, Mary Bryant's story is quite moving, if you are willing to wade through the strong content.  Her passion and will to live are truly inspiring.",1179360000,126,758,4.626865671641791

2729871,5,B000MG2LP4,"An excellent account of an amazing woman, & the people forced into the transportation system. These people, under the most dire and extreme circumstances, never gave up. Mary Bryant was real. She lived. There are several accounts of her life, and I am glad to have seen this one. It is important to remember the strength of those who went before us, and be grateful for it as well. This series does a good job of conveying that feeling.
The acting is top notch. Really very good. The costumes, and the locations both captured the feeling of what was going on. They did not hide the realities of the savage environment of the times, and this should be taken into account as to the age of the viewer. Not for children by any means. So, five stars.

The whole mini series is very engaging, while it is slow at some bits (they are at sea, what do you expect) for the most part it goes rather quickly and you find yourself cheering the main character, Mary Bryant, on. The officer who is obsessed with Mary to a disturbing degree does eat crow at the end but not in a satisfying enough way to the viewer.  The whole thing is  made even sadder by the fact it's based on true events. Of course they have embellished parts and cut out others but it is still sad. However, Mary Bryant is definitely an inspiration and this is well worth the time to watch.",1514937600,2,632,4.172131147540983

Mary Bryant was a truly innocent victim and courageous woman seeking freedom and a better life for herself and her children. The acting is superb, as is the gorgeous cinematography. Some scenes may be hard for some people to watch. This film contains a lot of sex, including mass rape. There are also brutal murders, injustice galore, undue harsh and violent punishment and servitude, and the instability of the human psyche when facing starvation and death. Yet, the authentic love and romance, sensitivity, and sweetness of such authentic characters carries the storyline through with beautiful grace, while also imparting the true essence of such a deeply meaningful and historical drama. A harsh and stark reminder of what so many before us had to endure. Sensual and believable film series. Highly Recommended!",1512777600,,894,5.302816901408451

2729881,5,B000MG2LP4,"Beautifully done. I prefer historical period movies based on fact and this movie is just that. I would like to see the full truth of the slavery these people were forced into and have it shown in a more  harsher truthful way. These people, many were arrested for the simple crime of stealing bread to feed their family and sent to become slaves in the penal colony while the rich lived in splendor. I see many reviewers angry with the ending of this story. SEveral male reviewers are angry that the woman was smarter than the men!  Most of these people don't know the history of how life was at the time of Mad King George. They don't realize that these people lived in abject poverty, the king owned all the land, most of the livestock and the wild animals used for food. People were starving to death in the streets. From my research, about 80% of the slaves sent to the colonies were really innocent, guilty of taking a loaf of bread from those who denied them even the most basic of human needs.

The acting is superb, and the costumes are historically accurate.",1511136000,2,1066,4.456410256410257
2729882,5,B000MG2LP4,"Very pleased with this. I first heard about Mary while watching a documentary years ago about world records.

2729886,5,B000MG2LP4,I was amazingly surprised at how well this was done. I chose it because of the actors. Sam Neill has several good shows on Amazon. If I'm not mistaken the lead on Hawaii 5-0 is in this too but much younger. Amazing story of a woman's will to survive through all hardships and her success arriving from a rather serendipitous direction. Great story! Well worth the time!,1508025600,,369,4.522388059701493

2729894,2,B000MG2LP4,"Beautiful historical story..Actor performed excellently..2 Stars for the story line and acting..I would have given a 5 star... But extreme nudity and open sex scenes making it not suitable for teens or children. This is sad for Amazon, because they have a choice to produce and write wonderful material, but continue to over-sexualize the photography with frontal nudity and soft porn. I have noticed that most of all Amazon produced material has used frontal nudity and heavy sex scenes which are totally unnecessary to the over all story.

2729895,4,B000MG2LP4,"After seeing all three episodes, I am rating this four stars overall. The perfect viewer for this will be a fan of the historical docudrama genre. As another reviewer said it is not of the same quality as Masterpiece Theater. It has the look right, the costumes and hairstyles are nicely done. The ships are convincing. The sets vary. The acting is as good as the script allows. The main character is presented as a feminist in her influence on the men in her life, though not above feminine wiles when it suits her purposes. The few characters that are well developed seem like legends but with clearly exposed human flaws. This could have had educational merit with some deleted content, but is a little shallow overall and has a little too much sex for teens or children. The context of the society creating Botany Bay gets too little attention. Only at the very end do we see the potential of the main character to have an impact on every level of society.",1507161600,2,960,4.554913294797688

2729898,4,B000MG2LP4,"While this is no Masterpiece Theatre production, it is still a well-acted, entertaining mini-series. Romola Garai, Jack Davenport, both English, Alex O'Loughlin, David Field, both  Australian, and New Zealander, Sam O'Neill are the standouts in this film  about Mary Bryant, an 18th Century Cornish woman who stole some food and other items because she was starving. Apprehended by the English authorities, she was sentenced to a life of penal servitude and transported to Botany Bay on the other side of the world  on the continent and country that  would one day be known as Australia.

While on the  harrowing journey across the seas to get there, she meets her future husband, as well as an English red coat who takes a ""special"" interest in her. She lives a number of years on Botany Bay with her husband and her children until famine conditions force her into a daring escape from her penal servitude. This is her story based on actual events.

The film has good production values and a great cast. The script could have dispensed with the torrid sex scenes between Mary and the English red coat, as they seemed almost gratuitous, even though that specific relationship was  germane to the story. Moreover, I did not find Mary Bryant to be a particularly likeable character. Still, the story was intriguing, leaving me  wanting to know more about Mary Bryant and her life from one of the several books written about her. Overall, I enjoyed the film.",1507075200,,1455,4.8582995951417
2729899,5,B000MG2LP4,"You will love this film.  I'm still wiping a few tears away.  You know it's a great movie when that happens.  This film is about a real historical figure, Mary Bryant.  She was a petty thief in England who was caught and sentenced to hanging for stealing a woman's bonnet and some food.  (imagine that.)  Her sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in Botany Bay, the first penal colony in Australia, England's grand experiment of using prisoners to attempt colonization of their new territory.  Mary does everything in her power to save her children from starvation.  She uses her wit, her looks, her charm, intelligence and sheer force of will to get her children to safety.  She meets her husband on board the convict ship that is sailing her to Australia.  She charms the Lt. Clark into helping her survive on the prison ship and then later in the penal colony. The two men vy for her love- whom will she choose?  You will love this prison escape/ romance/ adventure film- for me, it wasn't slow at all.  But then again, I don't mind a good story that takes its time.  This series takes a few liberties with the real Mary Bryant story by embellishing a sexual/romantic relationship between Mary and Lt. Clark.  Apparently, there really was a Lt. Clark serving in Australia during the years Mary was there- but it is unclear whether they were in the same colony or if the two ever met.  In any case, this series is wonderful.  Romola Garai does a great job as Mary and I loved Jack Davenport as Lt. Clark.

Too graphic for children, but the sexual scenes bring to light how privileged many are these days to not have to degrade themselves for theirs' and their children's survival.  Humans do that stuff, and this is a story about humans, after all.  I would also presume, however, that Mrs. Bryant didn't have baby formula, baby bottles, and sterilization equipment at her disposal, so if we were so into the realism, why was she never shown to be breastfeeding her wee ones? A little hypocritical if you ask me.  Mary Bryant was a courageous woman, whose love for her children knew no bounds. If you are afraid of strong women, move along.",1505779200,,681,4.754237288135593

I found it humorous that Governor refers to the indigenous people as ""savages"" and then sentences a man to the gallows, an act that by today's sensibilities is indeed savage.  Make no mistake, this is no comedy.  Most historical dramas are about the upper classes, or as some would put it - rich people problems.  This story does not romanticize the past, and it's all the better for it.

2729923,3,B000MG2LP4,"Acceptable although inaccurate period piece.  Mary's husband, William, was not shot.  He died of fever in a ship's hold after being recaptured.

After Mary's return to Britain, she was represented by a lawyer by the name of James Boswell.  Mary was ordered to be held for the remainder of her sentence in Britain.  Boswell helped obtain a pardon for Mary.  After Mary's release in 1793, she received a 10 pension from Boswell until his death in 1795.  That's why, at the end of the film, Mary was dressed so well.  I doubt there was any Lieutenant.

Overall, it was an OK mini-series.  They added some characters to enhance the story and keep their viewers entertained.  If you want to know more details about the real Mary Bryant, read it on Wikipedia.  There is no record of her date of death which is presumed to be after 1794.

This mini-series has depictions of oral sex, simulated sex, and partial nudity.",1504656000,3,911,4.654088050314465
2729924,2,B000MG2LP4,"If you are looking for an historical drama that is both interesting and informative about a period of British/Early Australian history then don't watch this show. Admittedly I only watch the first episode, but it was enough to convince me not to watch anymore. My main concern with the show was just how unrealistic and silly the storytelling was. The opening scene is a good example -  Mary lived in a fishing village in Cornwall where apparently the whole village was starving. The scene opens with Mary running up to a rich lady in a forest and snatching her bonnet. Magically soldiers appear from behind a tree at that very moment. The soldiers and the rich lady ran after her and wrestled her to the ground (yes even the rich lady tackles her around the legs and wrestles her into the mud..). In fact, Cornwall was not starving at that time exactly because it was a coastal town and had a free supply of fish. While many of those transported were starving (esp the Irish) this was not the case with Mary who was simply a petty thief. Then on the transport boat she was taken into the room of the lieutenant who worshiped her in a pure and celibate way. Again, the history did not reflect that as the typical experience that most convicts had at the hands of the sailors. In one scene on the ship her best friend, another women was given 25 lashes. Again while women were whipped on occasion we can be pretty sure the first time this happened was not to a woman for simply giving backchat to the captain.  However, the part that I found most unrealistic was the appearance of the actors throughout. They were meant to be poor and starving and yet they were all plump and bonney with lovely hair and perfect teeth. It reminded me more of ""Orange is the New Black"" or ""Outlander"" rather than a really gripping and gritty historical drama such as ""Roots"" or ""Prisoner: Cell Block H"". If you are interested in this period of history then please just skip this and instead order Robert Hughes ""Fatal Shore"" on Amazon.com for a good night of reading.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fatal-Shore-The-Epic-of-Australia-s-Founding/dp/0394753666/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fatal Shore: The Epic of Australia's Founding</a>",1504396800,5,2261,4.9317585301837275

She was stronger and more courageous than her male peers.  That is the moral of the story, not exploitation.  Some people are ridiculous.

As a film, it more or less worked, hence the 3 star review.  However, it was overly long and could easily have had an hour cut out.  There were constant shots of the cutter at sea alone in the wilderness (as well as showing the ship later).  Yes, we got it!  They were out in the middle of nowhere!  No need to keep drumming it into our heads.  And, most scenes just went on too long and were too detailed.  If it were shortened, it might rate a 4 star, as the story was compelling enough (though very soap-opery) and the actors were good. Final thing:  I was waiting at the end of the film for a word as to what happened to Mary.

That this fact is ignored in a real events story detracts from any basis in history. Its entertainment with an historic reference ignoring the bigger picture such as illiteracy, therefore a limited knowledge of the world. Perhaps my concerns are too serious for a made for TV production. However, the Irish shipped to America died before finishing their 7-10 years of work to mitigate debt; this includes children. Later when African slaves arrived they were treated terribly yet many of them lived, unlike the Irish before them.

Having said that the story is compelling, the acting good but I felt that Mary Bryant, even as portrayed, was not a likable woman.  It's the old 'the ends justify the means'.

2730017,4,B000MG2LP4,"What are you looking for? I bought this solely because of my mad crush on Jack Davenport and love for historical romances and was not disappointed in his performance.  This, however, is less a romance than one woman's tale of survival--at all costs.  The title character is sympathetic at first, getting caught stealing out of hunger.  She is transported to Botany Bay, the first penal colony in Australia. En route, she learns her best chance at survival is portraying an unfortunate innocent and fooling the handsome (yet ridiculously naive for an officer) British commander of the ship (Davenport).  He falls for it for a while but soon wises up and adventure and seduction ensue.  If you're looking for 4 hours of Jack Davenport in a sexy redcoat uniform, then you'll be pleased (like me!).  If you like to watch movies/read romance books without poking holes through the plot, then you'll be fine. But if you like your ""heroines"" to be likable and your storylines believable (like a high class officer would be so gullible!) and your endings nicely tied up, then you will be disappointed.

That is, made on the cheap and in a hurry. I would think the incredible story of Mary Bryant would compel more careful thought and execution. A white woman could not live in the open Botany Bay weather for three years and retain the lovely ""peaches and cream"" complexion of Romola Garai. I am not a movie technician, but I can assume that the task of a makeup person to achieve the weathered appearance for Ms Garai that would approximate that of a white female settler on the Oregon Trail (with a large bonnet, of course) would be a difficult task, for many reasons. Years in the  Aussie outdoors in the late 18th century would leave its mark. Also, there is a puzzling scene where an extremely famished Mrs Bryant is voraciously wolfing down bread while her (peaches and cream) daughter is daintily spooning soup. Little things like this can and do mar what would have been an A1 effort. And it is also unfortunate that the only subtitling option is Espanol. I was able to grasp about 75 percent of the dialog.

As I watched the last few scenes I felt as if my heart had been shattered! I had difficulty comprehending the fact that this film was based on a true story, and not a chilling nightmare brought to the screen.  It left me with a feeling of profound gratitude for the boundless freedoms and respect for humanity that is our way of life now.
  This is just a prologue to acquaint you with an explanation of circumstances that led to ""The Incredible Journey of Mary Bryant"".
  Mary was a tenacious, strong and determined individual. At age seventeen she was faced with starvation, and in her desperation she was arrested for stealing.  Her punishment was severe and excessive.  Along with many other prisoners she was sent to an island penal colony, where they were to raise food, build shelters and become independent.
  The ship that carried them to the island was a picturesque galleon, a huge vessel with many sails, bearing the name Christine.
  Mary discovered she was pregnant and would need better food and better care. by compromising herself she made an arrangement with a ships officer to share his quarters , She was given good food and a place to give birth and care for her child.  It was born during the passage and she named it Christine.
  There was much distress aboard the ship and one prisoner, a young man, attempted to help Mary at every opportunity.
  To survive the penalty they were given consisted of hard labor, add to that the savage conditions existing among the most dangerous prisoners among them. For three years they labored to raise food, but ultimately failed. The seeds would not grow, and the supplies they were given to start out with were dwindling. Once again Mary was confronted by the same old nemesis, starvation.
  Mary was determined to save her child and escape from the horrific island.  After much pleading she managed to convince the young man and four other prisoners to attempt the treacherous escape she had planned, knowing they would be pursued and the penalty would be death, if caught.
  By stealing supplies and a poorly constructed small fishing boat with only one skimpy sail. they left under cover of darkness.  Following the coastline as far as they could before turning out to sea, they stopped at an island in search of water. A small group of English  settlers greeted them.  Mary and the young man were married and soon a baby boy was born to them.
  They had to flee this safe haven when the pursuers arrived in search of them.  Thus began the incredible journey of Mary Bryant as they turned out to sea. Suffering from unbearable thirst, hunger, the relentless sun, near madness and intolerable grief it soon became a duel with death.
  I am recommending this riveting odyssey to stouthearted, tenacious movie lovers.  I gave it five stars because it is one of the most amazing ,heartrending movies I have ever experienced.",1369612800,2,3064,4.759013282732448

2730111,5,B000MG2LP4,"This film is based on the true story of Mary Bryant's life (although it does take artistic licence with some of the facts).

The whole cast are amazing in this but Romola Garai really shines as the heroine of the title. She's a great actress who I've also seen in a Brit production of Jane Austens Emma (she was a million times better than Gwyneth Paltrow in that part).

Here she plays the part with real fire and also makes you believe totally in what her character is going through.

The rest of the cast are great. Jack Davenport is excellent and Sam Neill is good as always.

The other actor who really stood out was Alex O'Loughlin who plays will Bryant. He was amazing in this and his final scene was just sublime. I've never seen so many emotions cross an actors face in one shot - ever. My heart was in my mouth watching his reactions to what was happening.

The story is genuinely heartbreaking (and some of the more horrible stuff portrayed here really happened, which makes it so much harder to watch).

2730123,5,B000MG2LP4,"This is a made-for-TV 3-hour movie and it's excellent.  An exciting true-life story.  Excellent production values (especially for a TV movie).  First-rate acting.  Actress Romola Garai (who plays the lead) is fabulous as Mary Bryant.  She nails every acting level perfectly, and there's so many levels--frightened, heart-broken, shattered, courageous, tough, sweet, plucky, deceptive, conniving, selfish, a leader, a loving mother, a good wife, a heroine.  She does an outstanding job.  And actor Jack Davenport is, as always, pitch-perfect as a 1700s British officer--he was born to play these types of roles.  The story is very much like Papillon--an incredibly daring, true-life adventurous escape story from an island prison.  You will be routing for Mary and her family.  Some reviews have mentioned the brief nudity and rape scene.  Though this scene may not be suitable for children, rest assured it is brief and fairly mild.  It is not one of those stylistically brutal and intense rape scenes that are hard to endure.  In fact, it's odd they even put the brief nudity and rape scene in, because it's out of context with the rest of the movie which plays like a PG-13 movie.  Overall, highly recommended for those looking for a great period piece adventure story.",1303689600,4,1271,5.136585365853659

2730125,5,B000MG2LP4,"I found Mary Bryant to be an incredible movie.  It was very realistic and totally believable.  Alex O'Loughlin was so good in this movie and I especially loved his portrayal as Mary's husband.  His love for her was very realistic and I found the scene where it was the night of their marriage to be one of the most romantic scenes I have every seen.  It was tender, romantic, believable and Alex was fantastic as her husband.  Throughout the movie he made you believe that Mary was the love of his life and he would die for her if necessary.  He is so expressive with  his eyes and his face that he doesn't even need dialog for you to know how he is feeling.

I found this movie to be my favorite movie and have watched it several times and Alex is just gorgeous in this role.  Love him in period costume and with his hair so curly.  If you are a Alex fan don't miss this movie.",1301529600,,878,4.1726190476190474

This is the most expensive film ever made in the history of the Australian film industry, and it shows. The writing, wardrobe, cinematography, makeup and of course the acting are all award worthy.

2730148,3,B000MG2LP4,"I truly enjoyed this little movie which gave what seemed a quite realistic view on the hardship endured by the convicts and accompanying soldiers a like when Australia was first colonized.

Having read about the many comments of the graphic scenes I must say I was a bit disappointed and surprised as what was shown seemed less graphic than in the average movie of the past 20 years.... a few pieces of bare skin and some indicative 'movements' was pretty much it. Maybe the other reviewers belong to the new wave of puritanism that seems to be spreading particularly in the US...? interested to hear a bit elaboration from those who were so taken a back ?

It was well acted and it was nice to see that both the convicts and soldiers were shown as human i.e. with good and more dark sides forming a more realistic picture than many period films where the characters are often entirely good or bad.

Without disclosing anything was I disappointed with the rather abrupt ending leaving too much for the viewer to assume - considering it is based on a true story it is natural to want to know a bit more as to what followed. This is my main reason for giving 3 rather than 4 Stars",1231200000,18,1178,4.444444444444445
2730149,1,B000MG2LP4,"I stopped watching the film after encountering the graphic, sex-scene.

A well-mannered person, brought up well, with good-taste and morals, who was writing an auto-biography book; would not go into details of sex. Neither should a well-mannered film. A well-mannered film would show them clothed, entering the bedroom, and closing the door, with the rest implied.

They may put a sex-scene in an ""R""-movie, because the ""R""-rating warns the purchaser in advance that the film is ill-mannered. My disappointment was believing I was buying a ""G"" or ""PG"" film, because this film was grouped with ""G"" and ""PG"" films within an Amazon recommendation to buy, and I neglected to check the rating for having bought many DVD's from Amazon's recommendations without encountering this.

The portion of the story I did see was 2-stars; such films never get better. Cover has nice costumes, sets, and scenery, but the mind of the writer is not worth watching.

Better movies are: Captain Blood, Treasure Island, Unconquered, Sinbad the Sailor-1946, Kidnapped, Swiss Family Robinson, Naughty Marietta, and the Princess and the Pirate with Bob Hope.",1228780800,24,1133,5.2430939226519335

This movie was very suspenseful and interesting. It is very graphic though and has scenes I cringed at. That makes you all the more want them to escape. I agree with another reviewer in that you are routing for her but at times don't totally agree with her methods. I was curious to how historically accurate the movie was after watching and read about her online. I saw that they did add some things for the sake of drama to the story and changed various details. I didn't think they should've changed those details just to make the movie more interesting because the real story is interesting also. I think it was very worth watching but its one of the kind I watch once and am finished with because I don't often enjoy movies with much violence or open sex which this has. I was glued to watching this till the end though and even couldn't help but shed a few tears near the ending which I never do. It has some what of a bittersweet ending.

FINALLY a movie/series about a strong, competent, clever, determined and dominant woman in which her strength and will are celebrated, not denigrated as in so many films. This film was made strictly from the woman's point of view and I applaud the filmmakers for keeping that POV consistent. Leave it to the Australians because this is something you would NEVER see from Hollywood despite all their 'PC' song & dance about the 'me too' movement they literally DO NOT put their money where their mouth (voice) is, if they did we'd be seeing at least half of all movies written and produced and directed by women. What hypocrisy. I've been watching streamed movies & TV shows exclusively for the past several months so I've seen hundreds of hours of films, some supposedly 'classic' and award-winning, but I've forgotten them all and I will remember this one.

Romola Garai is electric as Mary Bryant, a real woman who, at 16, was sent as a convict to Australia for reasons we would find absurd today. This, the most expensive TV movie in Australian history, melds her history with fiction, but is accurate overall - I am shocked (and a bit disgusted) at reviewers who dismiss it as 'feminist fodder' and 'oversexed.' That's nonsense: Mary Bryant - so brave, resilient and powerful - can still speak to us and inspire us.  She was on the infamous 'First Fleet' (look it up) and should be properly honored as a founder of New South Wales, which was the seed that became the modern nation of Australia.
