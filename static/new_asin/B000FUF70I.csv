8126802,1,B000FUF70I,"Mary Beth Hughes is given credit for being in Tanya. She is not. that was the reason I bought the D V D in the first place, so I was extremely disappointed. I felt like it was a total waste of my money",1396137600,,201,3.697674418604651
8126803,5,B000FUF70I,The movie is absolutely hilarious. The dialog is exactly what you want and expect from this classic 70's soft porn. Highly recommended!,1346803200,,135,5.181818181818182
8126804,5,B000FUF70I,"Wilbur and the Baby Factory is a decent softcore nudie with lots of simulated sex with voluptuous naked 70's-era vixens.  Lots of ridiculous situations and dialogue.  Worth checking out.

Tanya is a hilarious spoof of sexploitation films with actual hardcore oral sex thrown in.  No anatomical closeups, but you can see that actual oral sex is happening.  An awesome bonus to see Arnold's facial expressions as she is getting eaten out for real.  The downside is that the guy performing the oral sex looks exactly like Meathead (Rob Reiner)from Archie Bunker/All in the Family.  Maria Arnold's perfect body is reason alone to see this one.  What an incredible, curvy body.  Lots and lots of sex in this movie.

Also, as is typical with Something Weird Videos, you get a handful of previews of other classic nudies from the 70's.  More bang for the buck.",1323820800,,853,4.854166666666667
8126805,4,B000FUF70I,"This film is a fun spoof, based on the real-life 70s Patty Hearst kidnapping. In the movie, a young affluent woman named Charlotte Cane, is kidnapped and held for ransom. Her kidnappers are a group of radical revolutionaries, who are holed-up in a grungy hideout, in the Oakland ghetto.

They're a mixed-race bunch, who are committed to camaraderie, and saving the 'people' from the oppressive 'insect pig' capitalists. This band of freedom-fighters, are also dedicated to having lots of sex with each other. There's plenty of juicy sex scenes, including both interracial and lesbian trysts, between the group members. The sex in this film, is very graphic indeed, including showing lots of male full- frontal nudity.

Charlotte gets caught-up in the lustful antics of her kidnappers, and has marathon sex sessions with them all. She enthusiastically enjoys her newly uninhibited sexuality, that the kidnappers have awakened in her. Charlotte also becomes sympathetic, to the radical extremist cause of the group. She even renounces her name, choosing to be called Tanya instead. So, Tanya has to decide if she really wants to return to her former affluent, sheltered existence, when she gets the chance to do so.

If you like 70s sexploitation movies, that emphasis sex over other aspects of plot development, then you'll really enjoy Tanya.",1262476800,,1342,5.203703703703703

8126807,3,B000FUF70I,"It's not often that sexploitation movies take on sociopolitical themes, but these two movies made during the Vietnam era do just that (well, sort of), with mixed results. ""Wilbur and the Baby Factory"" is the goofy story of a jug-eared ladies man (Peter Ford) who dodges the draft by agreeing to participate in a two-year experiment in which he's to father 2,000 children. ""Wilbur"" is a cut above the usual trash culled from the vaults of producer Harry Novak, with a fairly interesting script, higher (but still cheap) production values and a pretty catchy theme song. The sex, however, is closer to what you might find from the nudie cutie era than '70s softcore. Not so in ""Tanya,"" a softcore sex-a-thon inspired by the Patty Hearst kidnapping. Looking like it was filmed in someone's garage, ""Tanya"" offers plenty of sex and self-parody, with Maria Arnold (a.k.a. Aronoff) getting most of the laughs as the empty-headed kidnap victim. When Cinque, the leader of the ""Symphonic Liberation Army,"" attempts to rape her, Arnold innocently responds: ""Don't you know I'm engaged?"" Later, another member of the SLA suggests the kidnapped heiress adopt a new name like Cinque. ""But Cinque's already taken,"" she replies. Both movies on this disk feature Russ Meyer alumni: Stuart Lancaster has a small role in ""Wilbur"" as wheelchair-bound, micro-endowed villain W.W.; and Patrick Wright has an even smaller role in ""Tanya"" as a cop who discovers the SLA's hideout. While not the cream of Something Weird Video's tawdry crop, both movies amusingly--if not always cleverly-- twist the issues and events of their time into sexploitation vehicles that are worth checking out.",1161907200,,1665,5.125
