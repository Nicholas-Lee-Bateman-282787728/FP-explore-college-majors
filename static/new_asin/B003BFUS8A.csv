8393583,1,B003BFUS8A,"The quality of this blu-ray is excellent: a very clear, crisp picture. Audio: Good! The actors and actresses are easy to hear and articulate very clearly Shakespeare's glorious lines. It's also fun to see and hear the audience's reactions to the various characters and events taking place on the stage. (The play appears to have been performed in the afternoon, like most of Shakespeare's actually were.) As to the rest: UGH!!! This is very much a NON-TRADITIONALIST version (ironically, put on at the traditional site of Shakespeare's plays). It has a racially mixed cast--like Kenneth Branagh's ""As You Like It"" but with logic thrown totally (totally!) out the door. (The Montagues are all white but Romeo's black.) Mercutio's entrance in the Queen Mab scene includes his baggy pants falling down and he and Romeo eventually lying stretched out on the floor together.(I guess to not so subtly suggest that Mercutio is gay.)In the portion I watched (I couldn't bring myself to watch the whole thing), there is next to NO attempt at scenery. It's like the director thought, ""It's enough to be presenting the play at the Globe (well, the restored Globe); we don't need anything else!"" Either that or he or she took too literally the Chorus in ""Henry V,"" urging the audience to exercise their imagination. (O, you have to exercise your imagination A LOT in this version!)The actors and actresses all, on coming on stage, flit across it like fairies! Hardly anyone walks!!(It makes for an energetic use of space, but Shakespeare wrote a DRAMA, not a ballet!) In the masquerade scene at the Capulets, the dancers (there ARE a few of them) instead of doing something stately, do something like a jitterbug-hop!!! (What the?) There is no dramatic attempt--at all!--to build up to Romeo suddenly falling in love with Juliet. It just . . . happens! (And ONLY happens verbally. We hear Romeo's words but . . . there's no soul, no SUBJECTIVE correlative at all[to alter T.S.Eliot's phrasing a little].) I could go on . . . but won't. Stick with the Zeffirelli. This version is interesting only in terms of how it CONTRASTS with that version.",1275264000,24,2131,4.889502762430939
