He's stuck in  a rut.",1497744000,,138,5.571428571428571
8729439,5,B0142WFSYY,"The departed deserved many more viewers than it got. Its director won the academy award for direction, and it was well-deserved. The story if unusual, certainly spell-binding, suspenseful, and interest-holding. The acting by all are great. It is, in my opinion, one of the best films.
The local police force wants to prove that the gang leader is corrupt, but, so it seems, he is working with the FBI. They place a man into the leader's gang to help prove his guilt. But they have their own infiltrator, a cop who is helping the gang leader. The film holds our attention throughout. It has lots of tension, such as the two rivals being attracted to and being  attracted by the same woman, and it has several, yes several, surprise endings.",1492041600,,739,4.684615384615385
