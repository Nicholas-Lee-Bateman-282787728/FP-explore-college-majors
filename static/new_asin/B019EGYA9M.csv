8744951,4,B019EGYA9M,I liked this movie. But I have a few problems with it. First off I have no problem with male nudity in movies. There's nothing wrong with nudity. But I didn't get why the nude male ghost was haunting the little boys room. I just thought the little boy shouldn't have been the ghost's target considering he was naked. He should have targeted the mom. The subject matter was just in appropriate for the little boy. Also I didn't get why the kid kept hiding in the dryer or why the police officer shot the naked man & didn't remember doing so. The movie didn't do a good job about explaining everything or trying to tie up loose ends. Other than that it wasn't a bad movie.,1491523200,,670,4.283464566929134
