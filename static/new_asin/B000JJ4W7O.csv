2672489,4,B000JJ4W7O,"My kids love this, and it's a yearly practice in our house to watch it at Christmastime. NOTE: it's a cleaned up version of the story done in archetypical storytelling style to introduce young viewers to the concepts of it. If you're looking for something hyper-accurate to all the Biblical details of the story, then this isn't it. What is does gloss over (mostly to protect young viewers), and what it does show is good and doesn't deviate much.",1389225600,2,447,4.670886075949367
2672490,5,B000JJ4W7O,"Short enough to keep children's attention, simple, true to the story & touching. Great DVD for the Christmas season to Remus us of why we celebrate it.",1380844800,,151,4.62962962962963

2672495,3,B000JJ4W7O,"This is an okay animated version of the nativity story from the Bible.  The animation isn't particularly detailed, but it's all right.  The characters speak in modern English, not King James version language.

If you are looking for a DVD of the real story of Christmas, this will work fine for you.",1234051200,6,299,4.711538461538462
2672496,1,B000JJ4W7O,I did not like this movie.  I got it to show my 2nd grade CCD class.  I showed it to my 4 yr old and 7 yr old first and now will not be showing it to my class.  Most of it was good but I wish they had ended with the birth of Jesus and the wise men coming to see him and then not going back to Herod.  Almost the last scene of the movie is Herod's soldier's ripping apart Bethlehem to kill all the baby boys.  I know this is what happened but it was not the image I wanted to leave my kids with when I showed them a Christmas movie.,1196899200,6,531,3.582608695652174

8150854,5,B000JJ4W7O,"My parents had these movies on VHS growing up and I was so excited to see it available on did. I wanted my kids to learn and know these scripture stories like I did when I was young and these videos helped me do that. They are beautifully animated and it is easy to follow and understand. These have a special place in my heart and when I sat down to watch them with my kids for the first time, they were just as I remembered them as a kid. I will be buying more of these different DVDs as they are available. My kids enjoyed the video from start to finish just as I hoped they would. Highly recommend these if you want to teach your children scripture stories in a way they will not soon forget.",1454284800,2,696,4.050724637681159

8150859,5,B000JJ4W7O,"I have to admit, I was a little skeptical about this movie since it looks a bit old-fashioned, but it really held the kids attention.  It is very accurate, biblically and has a great delivery of the story line.  The kids in Children's Church enjoyed it as well as my own kids.",1390348800,3,276,4.288461538461538
