Instead you get a lot of very well restored black and white documentary footage of California during the 20s and 30s. Obviously the footage of the San Francisco fire is the most dramatic, but for my money its the little events, like the traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge that gave me the most intersting history lessons. It's true that this is not a travel DVD in the usual sense, though I guess the films could have been intended for that purpose at the time. What it really is is just a bunch of neat historical film clips and there is nothing wrong with that.",1152835200,2,644,4.330578512396694
8159700,5,B0007P3546,"Wow!!!!!! I got a real kick out of these films. Of course, they are not travel clips. Most of the footage is documentary about historic events in California history (the building of the modern rail road for example) and are in black and white (as you would expect.)

I loved seeing what people wore to the beach in the 1930s - thank god fashion has changed since then. I'm surprised that some of this footage has survived as long as it has, and would like to see more Cali films from this era.",1146441600,,493,4.301075268817204
