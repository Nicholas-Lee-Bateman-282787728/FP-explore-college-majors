7973645,1,B0000714GL,"About these two motion pictures: THE THIRD MAN is THE definitive British film noir while MR. ARKADIN is one of Orson's weakest.

The issue here (and reason for that one-star rating) is the product itself.
MADACY's gray box series is of the lowest possible quality. Their SLP dubs track poorly and have degraded video of unrestored public domain stock.

Truth is, at that snail's pace speed they could've fit three or four lousy-playing films on a single VHS instead of offering this double dose space-waster.

Best advice to anyone still purchasing videotape: try to locate studio releases or at very least labels that you are certain record at the SP mode.",1253750400,5,657,4.900900900900901
