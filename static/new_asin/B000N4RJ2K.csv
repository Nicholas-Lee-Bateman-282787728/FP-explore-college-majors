8174856,5,B000N4RJ2K,"This is very nicely done. Many biblical narratives are dopey sounding. This is not. The words are all on the screen and the video is all congruent with the message, without low quality acting which would have detracted from the messages. It is a version I do not normally read, so it give fresh insights which I really like - simple conversational language. I put this on with a sleep timed at night and it is a great way to hear an hour of God's Word as I fall asleep.",1387324800,2,469,4.222222222222222
