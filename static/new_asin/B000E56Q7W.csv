2490070,5,B000E56Q7W,"Only available in VHS and out of print at that, this TV production casts Sean Connery's son, Jason, as Ian Fleming in what may or may not be a biographical portrayal.  It has all the action of any of Connery's Bond films, as many beautiful women, and a touching love story on top of all that.  Pity it's not available on DVD, but Bond fans are a different lot these days, and the widows haven't made a Bond film even close to Fleming's character in twenty years. This one would top off the Connery Bond set.",1183507200,2,507,4.270833333333333

2490099,1,B000E56Q7W,Great movie that I enjoyed years ago after hunting down on used VHS. Bought late last year on DVD (it is burned to disc as required) as part of a larger order and when I finally went to play it found disc skipped due to being cracked through centre hole and into data area. Item was still in cellophane and had not been crushed. Unfortunately by the time I went to open and play it I had passed the return period by just a few days. Check your disc for similar damage on receipt to avoid having to buy twice like I will have to now.,1423094400,,532,4.028301886792453

2490112,5,B000E56Q7W,"A good little biopic and a perfect way to set the context for the iconic James Bond. The book ""Fleming"" by Andrew Lycett gives one most of these snippets but they are well executed in this film.
Jason Connery does a good job too.
A lot of the material gets used in the various James Bond Books and some of it is also covered in Fleming's ""Thrilling Cities"" and ""The Man with the Golden Pen"".
All in all I thoroughly enjoyed this film just as I enjoyed the newer one with Dominic Cooper in the lead - ""The Man who would be Bond"".",1412899200,2,528,4.135922330097087
2490113,4,B000E56Q7W,"Originally broadcast more than twenty years ago during the long gap between Bond films Licence To Kill and Goldeneye, Spymaker: The Secret Life Of Ian Fleming has only recently been released on DVD as part of the Warner Archive Collection after having long been out of print on VHS. Claiming to be based on Fleming's life and exploits which inspired the creation of Bond, this TV movie also cast Jason Connery (the actor son of Sean Connery) in the role of Fleming. So is Spymaker a good Fleming biopic or a even a good movie?

As a movie, Spymaker fares decently While Jason Connery's stunt casting is both obvious and far from original, he nevertheless does a fair job as Fleming. Despite both a complete lack of physical similarity to the real Fleming and coming across as wooden in a couple of occasions, Connery does a better than expected turn covering the Bond creator from his school days through the Second World War. The result, while still more of a stunt than anything else, doesn't do the movie any harm either.

More successful is the supporting cast. The biggest highlight of which is undoubtedly a young Kristen Scott Thomas who comes across well as Leda St Gabriel, a character intended to be the Bond girl prototype. The cast also includes former Bond girl Fionna Fullerton who appears for a couple of minutes very early on while Julian Firth and  Marsha Fitzalan do well as characters clearly inspired by the Q and Moneypenny of the Bond films. The supporting cast is nicely rounded out by David Warner as Admiral Godfrey, Patrica Hodge as Fleming's mother and Joss Ackland as General Hellstein.

The production values are perhaps better than average for a TV movie, especially one doing a period setting. The sets and costumes call up much of the movie's period flavor from the wonderful evening gowns in the casino scenes to the weapons and uniforms seen during the film's second half. Veteran TV director Ferdinand Fairfax does a superb job of directing the movie and making what must have been a fairly small budget to good use. The only place where the limited budget becomes obvious in a couple of moments involving special effects shots that don't quite work but the results are good overall.

Despite its subtitle, viewers thinking they're going to get an accurate depiction of Fleming's life must instead take what Spymaker presents with a grain of salt for it can at best be called heavily fictionalized. While it certainly contains many kernels of truth, the script by veteran TV movie writer Robert J. Avrech often takes them and crafts them into bigger events. Examples include the section featuring Fleming covering the Moscow show trial of British engineers accused of sabotaging Soviet factories and a sequence later on where Fleming plays Baccarat against German General Hellstein in Lisbon, an incident based on a real event where Fleming played against a German agent but in both cases are significantly altered.

Indeed, Spymaker draws far more on the cinematic Bond than the literary Bond or Fleming's life. Examples include the entirely fictional characters of gadget master Quincy (played by Julian Firth) , secretary  Miss Delaney (Marsha Fitzalan) and the almost Blofeld like German General Hellstein played by Joss Ackland. Fleming also spends a good deal of screen time in a tuxedo, visiting a couple of casinos and a couple of martinis shaken not stirred are ordered all in Bond film tradition. Last but not least, the climactic (and entirely fictional) castle assault calls to mind similar sequences in numerous Bond films but perhaps none more so than that of You Only Live Twice. There are also moments where the score by Carl Davis evokes some of the John Barry style of Bond music as well.

In other places, Spymaker is closer to life. Kristen Scott Thomas' Leda St Gabriel shares characteristics with some of the woman in Fleming's life around the time the movie is set while a scene where Fleming presents  a rather unorthodox plan to his boss Admiral Godfrey which leads Fleming to ask if he got his memo and Godfrey's response that You send me a hundred memos a week! calls to mind some of Fleming's more outlandish wartime plans. Also, while the aforementioned castle assault is entirely fictional, it does echo some of commando operations carried out by the 30 Assault Unit that Fleming helped to organize (and which itself was the subject of the heavily fictionalized film Age Of Heroes). All in all, readers of Fleming biographies or even those who have seen the Fleming biography extra on the various DVD and Bluray releases of the Bond film The Living Daylights will likely be able to spot a lot of Spymaker's often considerable fictionalizations.

Spymaker then is far heavier on fiction than fact. On one hand, it perhaps tries too hard at times to make connections with the world of Bond films with its mix of fact and fiction coming across at times as forced. What it is perhaps better as is an attempt to do a psuedo-Bond film in a period setting and it's indeed interesting to contemplate that, with a few changes, Spymaker could almost as easily be the origin story of Bond as it is a biopic of his creator. For its faults as a Fleming biopic then, Spymaker could easily be the closest things fans are likely to get to a period Bond film and for that reason alone is worth seeking out.",1407801600,5,5354,4.797180043383948

2490115,5,B000E56Q7W,"I first saw this on TV and taped it. I later transferred it to DVD, but, of course, the picture was VHS quality.  Now finally I have it on DVD and it looks great. One note:  the puritans of America have altered the front cover and deleted the sexy lady that you see on the UK version.  The good news is that the restored the very small flash of skin that was not allowed on American TV.

This is the story of Ian Fleming and you see many hints to what he would use later in his Bond books.  It is well done and stars Sean Connery's son.  It is a very enjoyable movie.",1405728000,5,567,3.9298245614035086

2490118,4,B000E56Q7W,"If you like James Bond you'll like this. I thought the movie was a lot of fun. It's about Ian Flemming the man that wrote the James Bond series. It shows how he came up with James Bond, Money Penney, Q, and M. James Bond is played by Jason Connery, Sean Connerys real life son (which I thought was a nice touch). The only complaint I have is that the Post Office just can't seem to compete with FedEx or UPS.",1400284800,,408,4.049382716049383
2490119,4,B000E56Q7W,"Having just concluded watching a BBC America mini-series called ""Fleming: The Man Who Would Be Bond"" staring Dominic Cooper as Ian Fleming, I thought it would be fun to dig out this similarly themed film.  It was originally made for cable TV, but did show up in a few movie theaters as well.  Interestingly enough Fleming here is played by Jason Connery, the son of, you guessed it, Sean and actress Diane Cilento.  Like the TV series, ""Spymaker"" provides a broad outline of Fleming's early adult life as a well-educated aristocrat with a domineering mother.

At the onset of WWII, Fleming enters the Royal Navy as a commander, and according to the film has an instrumental role in creating espionage units to uncover Nazi plans.  If you are a fan of the Bond films like me, you should have a fun time seeing some of Flemings early encounters with women, playing Baccarat, creating gadgets (with help from his nerdy friend Quincy) and confounding his bosses.  The film also features a 20-something Kristin Scott Thomas as Leda St Gabriel, one of the few women Fleming actually falls for.

The film has several scenes of ""sexy-time"" as Fleming gives the fictitious Bond a run for his money in the bedroom.  There is also enough action to keep it all interesting.  The real question is only how much of Fleming's escapades are actually true.  This is a fun ride and a worthwhile look at the creator of one of the great fictional characters in history.  Alas the film is only available on VHS tape and DVD.  No Blu ray.",1393372800,6,1516,4.657894736842105

2490126,4,B000E56Q7W,"The title to my review alludes, quite obviously, to a comparison with the Shakespeare In Love/George Lucas In Love film-making. Having said that, it isn't so obvious and imposing in this film. This fun, period jape of a movie supposedly tells the story of Ian Flemming and how he came to devise the ingenious Bond character we all know today. For sure, the Casino Royale references are obvious (although I hate the comedy version of James Bond in the Peter Sellers version - utter garbage!) and there are other little tidbits of 'Bond' especially at the begining. This is a fun movie to watch, but I feel this is more of a romatic view of Ian Flemming, with a lot of 'poetic licence' taken. What the hell, it is a lot of fun. The period sets and acting - very stiff-upper-lip-British, old boy - is spot on. Fact or fiction? Heck enjoy the story and who cares!",1282694400,,859,4.477707006369426
2490127,4,B000E56Q7W,"Never had it crossed my mind that Ian Fleming himself was once an agent himself. After viewing this neat TV movie it doesn't surprise me how Fleming was inspired to create his literary hero, soon to become cinematic emblem.

The movie begins with the origin of young Ian Fleming, he was a son of rich parents, he never needed anything, and everything was at his disposal. As we see him transcend to young adulthood we see a very similar persona to that of 007. We see him as a womanizer and a man of wit and class. shortly in the film he is expelled from various private schools due to misadventures with women. His mother decides to put him in a military academy so he can learn a lesson...he ends up doing the same thing; finally his mother decides to put him in a news bureau known as Reuters. While working there he finally accommodates and begins to take his life a bit more seriously.

Trough the picture we see him transform from a young aristocrat into a secret agent spying on the Soviet Union; and the best part of all this is the actor they chose for the part, Jason Connery. Jason Connery is Sean Connery's son; Sean was the first theatrical actor to play 007. Here his son brings the exact class style and vulnerability of his father. Like they say like father like son.

Now the movie is not without being criticized, the movie in the end is more fantasy than fact. Sure many of the things mentioned in the film did occur according to his biographies and interviews but in the end the movie represents a fictionalized version of his life. now that does not mean the movie is not worth it, on the contraire it's highly worth it, due it's story, trauma and the amazing love story between Fleming and a fellow agent. Overall the movie is highly recommended. it's unfortunate that is only available on VHS; and not to mention that it has long since been out of print. I'm sure you can still find good copies here at Amazon for a fare price.

Ian Fleming was a spy in real life. No James Bond collection could ever be complete without this little item. This movie showed how the author of the successful movie series got the inspiration to write the series.

Some of the things in the movie didn't happen, and it was more of a nod to the movies more so than the novels. One thing that is a running gag in the movie is a hat always being thrown on the hat rack, which never actually happens in the novels. So, a lot of people would believe that is what inspired it, but it is just a joke to the movie. Still, it is fun to watch and is very entertaining.
