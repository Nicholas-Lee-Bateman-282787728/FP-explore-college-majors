990225,4,6305223319,"DOUBLE TAP (1997) stars Heather Locklear as FBI agent Katherine Hanson. During an undercover operation, the criminal subjects are murdered, right in front of Hanson. This pattern repeats, as it apparently has many times before, meaning that someone is killing off the bad guys before the FBI can arrest them. He's known as Cypher (Stephen Rea), a hit man, currently working for a mobster named Nash (Peter Green). At least, Nash thinks Cypher is working for him. In reality, Cypher has his own agenda. Hanson and her team must track him down, before he kills every lowlife criminal in the city! Nash makes a final, ""fiery"" appearance. Ms. Locklear is quite good in her far-grittier-than-usual role,and the story is interesting / novel. <> RANT ALERT! <> The only thing I don't like about the movies of the late 90's, is how they ushered in the whole every-scene-must-be-dark syndrome. I mean, unless the characters are standing outside, in full sunlight, they're always cloaked in smokey, shadowy dimness! It's as though no one could afford to provide sufficient lighting! Ugh! <> RANT OVER <>  Not a bad one for movie night, especially for Heather Locklear fans!...",1512432000,3,1166,5.010309278350515

990227,5,6305223319,"Aight...  this is rare...  I am giving 5 stars to this movie...  does it deserve it???  probably not...  should probably be more like 3.5 to 4...  BUT...  here is my thought process...

I recognize at least 10 actors in this flick ( and they all did well )
I recognize that at least10 later movies stole ideas from this movie
Camera work was fine...  Sound was fine...  Special Effect ( limited ) were fine...
I can watch this movie again...  potentially more than twice

I don't want to give away any spoilers and whatnot...  I think this movie could be 1/2 hour longer to be honest, to give more time for character development...  but it was done n 1997...  so...  meh...

Only minor twists / turns in the plot...  but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is a solid flick...  I don't even want to say anything else, because adding more could be potential spoilers...

It's good...  highly recommend for any action / crime junky...  ( not a lot of blood and gore...  yeah, I know I watch more horror... )

How I never saw this movie until now is beyond me...",1510790400,3,1070,4.369230769230769
990228,2,6305223319,"I have a VHS copy I recorded off HBO long ago and love the movie.  However, this Amazon copy has been cleaned up and edited.  I didn't know movies had to come with child-proof caps now.",1508976000,3,185,4.111111111111111
990229,4,6305223319,I watch this movie twice a year. I had a vcr tape prior to receiving the dvd which is great,1439164800,3,91,3.6
990230,5,6305223319,"This is a hard-to-find film and few saw it. It is a great, edgy piece that has psychological twists and turns that are unexpected, packed with action, deep romantic theme of bizarre nature. I think it was panned because Heather Locklear was in it and Hollywood couldn't accept her in more than a tv role; she's too cute and perky. Yet here, she is great and makes perfect sense to the story. This is one of my favorite films in the world but saying that in Hollywood is like saying, ""I read The Enquirer."" when we know --everyone does.",1407456000,3,535,4.414141414141414
990231,5,6305223319,I had been looking for the DVD to this movie forever Im settling for the VHS. Glad I haven't tossed out my old VHS player.,1368057600,,122,3.92
990232,4,6305223319,"Great late night movie with popcorn.  This was an enjoyable movie.  I've watched it about three times and would enjoy having in on DVD.  No, this isn't the best movie you've ever seen, it never had such lofty goals.  Stephen Rea was enjoyable as a hitman with his own quirks, but he was serious and the writers didn't write him making mistakes in order to create more story.  Please release this on DVD.",1353974400,,403,4.465753424657534
990233,5,6305223319,"The last time I saw Heather Locklear in anything was her performance as Sammy Jo in TV's Dynasty. Come to think of it, she was quite wonderful in that role. This film is has the advantage of a 100 percent cast, story, production, etc., and some rather great music. Let's hope to see more of Heather in films of this calibre. She deserves the opportunity, after all these years, to go straight to the top.",1057104000,2,404,4.4
7885332,5,6305223319,"Excellent acting and great plot, just did not go far enough to make the higher level connections. I loved how the truth was here, only the people making the moving probably did not understand. Done a long time ago, now we know. I thought casting was really good, characters were all believable. Well worth the time to watch, unlike most of the garbage out there.",1516838400,,362,4.584615384615384
7885333,1,6305223319,"About 5 minutes was all I could take. Poor acting, directing and camera work. Deserves only one half star.",1515542400,,106,4.631578947368421

7885335,3,6305223319,"The experience of this movie is truly uncanny -- not in any innovative sense, but in the panoply of actors whose careers abruptly terminated about Y2K. In fact, that's the most interesting thing about this movie, the times I paused it to check ""See, wasn't that guy in 'Go'""!!??  Hopefully, most have gone on to fruitful careers cutting ribbons a boat shows and the like.  Man, am I feeling old, lol ;)

Okay, so this movie doesn't really live up to its billing, something that owes to pacing that is waaay slow for a its genre.  No need to go further than that, really.  Maybe only to say that the novelty of using chapter titles for certain scenes and certain other gimmicks are looking about as worn as my Rage Against the Machine t-shirt.",1514764800,,742,4.507462686567164

7885338,5,6305223319,Anything with Heather Locklear gets 5 stars I don't care how bad it is. No really It is not that bad of a movie heck it was made in 1997. Can't believe we're not paying 3 bucks to watch it!,1513987200,,189,3.75
7885339,1,6305223319,"Bad audio and worse audio editing of obscenities.  It's 'R' rated, why would you do that?  Terrible story.  Took me less than 10 minutes to just turn it off.",1513987200,,157,4.344827586206897
7885340,4,6305223319,"I was really surprised by this one. It was a lot better than I thought it would be. The acting was decent, and the plot had a different twist to it, which is always a welcome change over the same old thing all the time. If you like hitman movies, then you should enjoy this one.",1513555200,,278,3.982142857142857
7885341,3,6305223319,Waste of time. Stupid dubbing making this film ready for TV.,1513382400,2,60,4.545454545454546
