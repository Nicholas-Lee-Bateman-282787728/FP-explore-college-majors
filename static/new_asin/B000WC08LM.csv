The Polish Air Force,  like the 5 million Polish-catholics murdered by Hitler and Stalin are constantly and painfully overlooked in History books, here in the USA. Overdue, is the respect to the Poles for their incredible contributions and heroics of WWII.",1219622400,9,390,5.190476190476191
8222105,5,B000WC08LM,"This DVD is a collection of newsreels from the 1940's Battle of Britain. Despite all the books on that epic struggle, I'd recommend this collection most highly because nothing beats watching the news of the day to get a feel for the people the newsreels were filmed for.

You will see footage of actual air attacks that make you cringe in your recliner, and you will feel the fear as airplanes battle each other in the sky, as bombs explode in neighborhoods that could have been yours. More than 60 years later, most of the world was not alive yet when Britain fought for its life and endured a hell of fire, noise, and devastation.

With this DVD you will know what it was like to live through a nightmare from which people felt they would never wake up.",1199664000,10,755,4.424460431654676
