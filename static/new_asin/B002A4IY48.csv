8358874,5,B002A4IY48,"Loved this movie because it is about a group of retired men interested in the opera.  I am retired so I could relate.  I loved the personalities and their interactions with one another.  They were a group of scrappy, crabby old men who could swear up a storm if things didn't go their way.  I also liked the setting of alley ways, narrow streets, etc.",1393977600,,351,4.3538461538461535
