However, the DVDs do NOT have subtitles in Spanish as indicated in the product details. I am upset at this since not everyone in my family is fluent in English, and this is the reason why I bought this edition of the DVD set. Without subtitles they are not able to get the full information shared in these documentaries. I will not return the product, but you should note the lack of subtitles before ordering.",1364774400,4,525,4.536842105263158

3422777,5,B001957A44,"This box set is fantastic!  I am half way through it so far.  I have watched the Planet Earth and the Blue Planet so far and they were wonderful.  I had previously bought and watched ""Life"" which was the best natural history collection I have ever seen.  The only thing I would recommend is to watch this box set before Life as Life is more recent and watching it in the order I did meant that the BBC collection didn't have the same wow factor as Life.",1301097600,,453,4.172413793103448
3422778,5,B001957A44,"amazing box set, a must for everyone, including children, extremely educational for all ages, even the price is a steal. Go for it before it goes out of print.

3422782,5,B001957A44,These are films every child (and adult) should see many times.  I cannot get over all the information available and so lovingly presented.,1261699200,,138,5.0
3422783,5,B001957A44,"I can not begin to express what an amazing collection of outstanding videos the BBC has put together.  Superb quality of picture and sound make this DVD set stand out among any documentaries that I have ever witnessed.  I have traveled to mountains, canoed hundreds of miles down the Mississippi River, and seen some of the most beautiful things on this Earth... This is the next best thing for me.  When I can't be out seeing things first hand, this collection has enough DVDs to keep anyone entertained for days on end.
Each DVD covers a new and interesting subject.  Many things that I will never see up close, and yet- these videos create a feeling that you have seen it.  What an awesome collection.

Obviously, I give this series a lot of praise and have given it 5 stars.  It is expensive to some, but you get so much out of it - for any family too - that it is hard to resist.  I recommend it to anyone and everyone except for tiny infants because of their lack of attention span and their limited capacity of and for English vocabulary.

On a personal note... When visiting my Grandfather, I brought along this set.  He could not believe what he was seeing.  He was taken aback and asked to borrow the rest.  It really is something to see.",1255478400,4,1248,4.401746724890829
3422784,5,B001957A44,"This is an AMAZING DVD set.  When I watch it, I always think of the amount of man power it took to produce something like this.  The educational value of this series is wonderful.  This is something the whole family can watch and enjoy at the same time.  I would totally recommend to any nature lovers out there.  MUST GET!",1252195200,,323,4.316666666666666

3422796,5,B001957A44,"I was a birdwatcher as an early teen and have been able to visit Galapagos among other places in Latin America/Caribbean.  I bought this set for myself and sent a second set to my grandchildren.  So far I only watched Blue Planet and the Life of Birds but expect to watch Planet Earth and Life of Mammals next.  I hope my grandchildren will enjoy these and learn and experience as much as I have.
The filming and commentary is exceptional,",1246665600,,439,4.4625
3422797,5,B001957A44,"This was purchased as a gift for a 16 year old. She was delighted. The best gift ever. We recommend these CD's  for every age. I was fortunate to purchase during a deal of the day, saving a lot of money. Yet, still worth the full pricing. A must have! The bird CD is our favorite.",1243987200,,280,4.0
3422798,5,B001957A44,"I had rented the individual programs in this boxed set and found all of them to be informative, interesting, and entertaining. The excellent and often gorgeous cinematography is a huge plus too. I really wanted to buy them all, but found that they were too expensive on their own. Then I found this boxed set and when Amazon had an earth day sale, it became insanely affordable and I had no choice but to buy it. The packaging for the individual series are quite nice and the box they slip into is sturdy. Overall I'm glad that I waited and sprung for this set. If you love nature programs and you don't have these in your collection, I heartily recommend this set. The amount of enjoyment you'll get will well outweigh the cost.",1243296000,5,729,4.488721804511278

Every nature lover should have these great DVDs, the quality is amazing. I cant watch enough of them.
Thank you BBC.",1243036800,,131,5.0
3422802,5,B001957A44,This is an amazing collection at an amazing price. Your life is not complete without these DVDs. Hours of awe. Just go for it. Planet Earth and Blue Planet are absolutely beautiful. The Life of Mammals and Birds are highly overlooked and are equally amazing. Your life is not complete without this!,1242172800,,298,4.75
3422803,5,B001957A44,Add to your knowledge and have fun at the same time. These are great projects. Thanks.,1241740800,,86,4.4375
3422804,5,B001957A44,Thanks to the upconverting of my LG blu-ray player I viewed this series in almost HD quality. I bought this on a gold box deal for a little over 4 per disc. I think this is one of the best of the many incredible deals I've purchased at Amazon over the years. The entire series is so visually stunning and its bonus is it being highly educational. I think everyone should view it at least once either as a special on TV or rent it from Netflix. After watching the set it made me more convicted to environmental stewardship. My favorite of the series was Life of Mammals only due to the topic. Next was the Blue Planet and I also purchased this as a stand alone set for a friend. Truly this series has something for everyone and may pique your interest in a subject you previously had no interest. I don't see how anyone would be disappointed in this breathtaking series. Enjoy.,1240876800,14,876,4.347560975609756
3422805,5,B001957A44,"Epic, landmark, stunning: there aren't enough superlatives for these wildlife series. They are, very simply, the ultimate. If you, your family, or your children are interested in the natural world -- and we all should be so interested -- then these 17 discs are a dream come true: over 33 hours of the most awe-inspiring yet intimate views of the animals that occupy our earth, seas, and skies, together with amazing facts about their lives, habitats, and diversity.

The four series were photographed by hundreds of cameramen who spanned the globe for more than a decade to uncover the stories of every type of life, from the very small to the enormous, and narrated by David Attenborough, one of the world's foremost naturalists and filmmakers. This bargain-priced compact set is the way to go, for after seeing one of these incredibly beautiful series, you will want them all.

Most famous, and justly so, is the series ""Planet Earth."" Each episode focuses on the biota of a particular biome: mountains, fresh water habitats, caves, deserts, plains, icy regions, jungles, seas, forests, and oceans. The geology and seasonal changes of each zone are explored and documented with magnificent clarity, and exciting supplements take you into the making of the series, the cutting-edge technologies involved, and the astounding patience and death-defying efforts of the camera crews.

""Planet Earth"" is the most recent series, the pinnacle of BBC nature programs, and the most wide-ranging and fascinating. Yet the previous series included in this set -- ""The Life of Birds,"" ""The Life of Mammals,"" and ""The Blue Planet: Seas of Life"" -- concentrate with far more detail on the creatures that occupy specific habitats. They are almost as good as ""Planet Earth,"" which is to say utterly spectacular, head-and-shoulders above every other nature series ever filmed.",1236643200,83,1860,5.172757475083056

8271916,5,B001957A44,"The Great Barrier Reef is informative, the reef is dying, but not as fun as the BBC Natural History Collection series: The Life of Birds, The Blue Planet, The Life of Mammals, Planet Earth I and II. The History Channel's Universe series and the two Cosmos series are also good.

If the above don't sound interesting you might like a couple of space race shows. I spent a month on a space race binge. First I read Space by James A. Michener. Then I watched two movies, The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), and then two great series, From Earth to the Moon (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015). Theyre a great combination.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,1959,5.2492012779552715
