2036217,5,B0001WHYCO,Good old movie (no blood sex or violence but good storytelling and some light humor),1504915200,,84,4.666666666666667
2036218,5,B0001WHYCO,Nice!,1504483200,,5,5.0
2036219,4,B0001WHYCO,"This was very good for the Soviet era. :) Kind of innocent and romantic comparing to modern interpretations. The characters are a bit rigid in my opinion, but that is probably because of Soviet mentality. People got used to hide emotions. Sherlock Holmes is the best, but I cannot stand Nikita Mikhalkov as Sir Henry. The actors real life behavior is so unpleasant that don't want to see him on screen anymore. I wish there was someone else.",1504310400,,441,4.666666666666667
2036220,3,B0001WHYCO,At the midway point the subtitles were replaced with credits. About 15 minutes of the movie has no subtitles and it was at a critical point in the story. I tried skipping forward to find when the subtitles picked up again but then lost interest and didn't watch the rest of the film. A shame as I would have liked to see the whole thing.,1504051200,5,337,4.2
2036221,5,B0001WHYCO,"Best of the best; if, you don't mind reading subtitles. Very atmospheric. As SACD remarked to his mother in a letter [when collaborating with Fletcher 'Bubbles' Robinson [who came up with the essence of the curse and some of the discourse], 'a real creeper'. The Russian interpretation of the Hound is horrifying, no CGI here!",1408060800,3,326,4.945454545454545
2036222,5,B0001WHYCO,"Of all the versions of ""Hound..."" I've seen, this may be the best. (Though I dearly love the Hammer version with Peter Cushing as Sherlock Holmes.) It's very faithful to the original story.  Vasili Livanov is at first a bit different as Holmes, mostly because he doesn't really physically resemble most people's image of the character. His performance, however, is top-notch. Vitali Solomin is a vibrant, assertive Watson. Best of all is Nikita Mikhalkov as Henry Baskerville. Normally, this is a dull, thankless role, but Mikhalkov brings both humor and charisma to the part. The settings are great; Baskerville Hall never looked so gloomy and unappealing. All in all, a great bit of cinematic Sherlock, and highly recommended to all fans of the character.",1337472000,5,757,5.104838709677419
8017397,5,B0001WHYCO,big sherlock holmes fan and had scoured all versions made in this genre but somehow had  missed this russian interpretation by vasiliy livanov. by far the best most human sherlock holmes made and the relationship between and the doctor is believable and touching.,1523318400,,263,5.116279069767442
8017398,5,B0001WHYCO,The best version of Holmes ever. Great acting.,1521072000,,46,4.875
8017399,5,B0001WHYCO,"Superb high quality Russian version with subtitles arranged via the settings icon by the volume control for the movie. High production values, moody settings, the best interior furniture in the castle, and a good job of acting by all concerned. The Hound is especially well done. The pipe of Laura Lyons the sideboard for wine carvings to Sir Hugo's portrait are all first class. Any fan of Sherlock Holmes will appreciate this version and actor. No wonder the Queen of England gave him a medal for his work. One of the top 5 versions of Sherlock Holmes and the Hound. This is in my top 10 of Holmes stories, and this version does it justice. I got so into it the subtitles and foreign language did not get in the way of watching this Holmes in action. The interaction between Holmes and Watson is especially good. I would not have missed it for the world and I bought the DVD boxed set to prove my appreciation of this version.",1518048000,,928,4.497041420118343
8017400,5,B0001WHYCO,Probably the best portrayal of Sherlock Holmes. Livanov's amazing in this role. Great series.,1517875200,,93,5.714285714285714

8017403,5,B0001WHYCO,simply a masterpiece with what the russians had left from their 40 +yrs of tyranny to pay tribute to doyle in such away makes me very proud of this earth and its accomplishments and how all can love to such devotion as to not only create but keep in the very narrow script as even the british would tribute as exemplary acting and writing,1509926400,,338,4.296875
