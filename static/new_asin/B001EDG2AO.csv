8297919,3,B001EDG2AO,"I saw a few moments of Rhys Darby doing stand up and bought this as a gift.  When it arrived, we tried to play the disc only to find that it was an international format that none of our players could recognize.  I was bummed.  But that's no fault of Rhys Darby.  He's fantastic!",1390953600,,278,4.092592592592593
8297920,5,B001EDG2AO,"Hilarious. Rhys Darby is known to many people as Germaine and Brett's manager on the HBO show ""Flight of the Conchords"", but he is so much more than that. This dvd is amazing.",1358208000,,175,4.333333333333333
8297921,5,B001EDG2AO,"My boyfriend and I watched this on Comedy Central, and I purchased it as a gift for him.  It arrived on time and in good condition.  It was exactly what I needed.",1300752000,,162,4.03125
8297922,5,B001EDG2AO,"I have watched this special SO may times and still laugh through it. He is HILARIOUS in his own little oddball way. Im not sure if my having been to australia/nz multiple times effects how much of his humor I may possibly get and love even more due to, but all I know is that i LOVE his comedy!!! His new zealand roots help give his comedy a fresh feeling in his stand-up routine as well.",1267574400,,388,4.118421052631579
8297923,1,B001EDG2AO,"I am sure, going by the clips I have seen on YouTube, this is really funny, but I can't watch it on my player. If you buy this DVD on the Amazon US site, the region flag is not indicated. This is NOT a Region 1 DVD and will not play on US or Canadian DVD players (unless you want to research the region hacks). Oddly enough, the UK Amazon site does indicate that it is Region 2.",1266537600,,378,3.858974358974359
8297924,5,B001EDG2AO,"If you are a fan of ""Flight of The Conchords"", then you will love this stand-up. I would describe this as the Murray Hewitt doing an hour of stand-up. As a performance, this ranks right up with anything I've seen in the past 15 years. I've watched it three times since I've purchased the DVD and have lent it out several times, always to have it returned with glowing reviews. The intro scenes before the actual performance are cheesey, but the stand-up more than makes up for it. Buy this today, you won't regret it.",1255910400,2,517,4.4526315789473685
8297925,5,B001EDG2AO,i saw this on comedy central a week ago and i still laugh about it.  buy it.  its worth it,1251590400,,90,3.45
8297926,3,B001EDG2AO,"I had high hopes for this video, having really enjoyed Rhys Darby's performance in Flight of the Conchords.  The problem here is that while I like him, I just didn't find his material to be very funny in this special.  I think the writing was just lacking something.  At many times it felt like he was right on the edge of something good but never quite got there.  It's too bad, considering he does a brilliant job turning his character in Conchords into such a believably odd person.",1250726400,2,485,4.4772727272727275
