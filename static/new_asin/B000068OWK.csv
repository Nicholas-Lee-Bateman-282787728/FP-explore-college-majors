Moonbase 3 was a British science fiction television programme, which ran for six episodes. It was an ambitious attempt by the BBC in 1973 to create a technically accurate science fiction program.
The narrative was about scientists and administrators who attempt to conduct experiments, while affected with budgetary cutbacks, equipment failures, work stress, personal isolation, and a heartless Earth bureaucracy.

The stories have none of speculative fiction themes such Aliens, space battles and faster than light travel. Instead, the stories are often grey and disheartening. The base is cramped devoid of luxuries. Staffing levels are below par, the technology is undependable, and everyone is under constant pressure to produce results. The one central theme is that outer space is lethal and challenging; any tiny error could bring about disaster.

The audience are shown the lives of men and women researchers on a European moonbase, that at times are inaccessible for weeks at a time, leading to psychosomatic pressure and at times conflict. There was none the more exotic fare offered by the likes of Space 1999 and other Space Operas. It is easy to see why the program was never an audience-winner.

However, the program has some extremely pioneering themes, which are never explored in other television. The programme was noteworthy for its combination of realistic spaceflight procedures, and its strong character-based writing. Moonbase 3, as a compilation series set on a lunar colony that would ""provide intelligent, realistic drama rather than Science Fantasy"". In its search for realism, the show gave off a sense of claustrophobia and isolation that undermined the assurance of its foundation. Although very dated in terms of its looks and assumptions about the future, it remains well regarded in retrospect. The transfer to DVD is not the best; the colours seem washed - but still watchable.

7964484,5,B000068OWK,"This was a too-short-lived, excellent, dark, gritty, hard-sf series about humans living on the Moon in the 21st century. If all you want from sf is flashy effects, cheese and aliens, then look elsewhere. Moonbase 3 is a thought-provoking drama that stands up very very well 30 years later.",1213228800,8,289,4.918367346938775
7964485,2,B000068OWK,"Perhaps not the best example of British sci-fi from the 70's set in 2003 on a European and American manned moonbase, this series debuted in 1973 approximately three years after Gerry Anderson's ""UFO"" and aired one year before ""Space 1999."" Produced by ""Dr. Who"" Barry Letts and writer Terrance Dicks, one would expect great things form this talented team and a series with James Burke (""Connections"" and ""The Day the Universe Changed), as a technical advisor.

Sadly, this is not the case with ""Moonbase 3."" Talky, pretentious, and dull, with laughable special effects along with flimsy sets, ""Moonbase 3"" tries hard to realistically portray the daily life and hazards on the moon, yet manages to fall flat on its face most of the time. Some of the episodes like ""Outsiders"" and ""Castor and Pollux"" are tense and interesting dramas--the former about a manic depressive scientist on the base who contemplates suicide, and the latter, about a nailbiting space rescue from a capsule.

The minatures used on the series are no better than the average kit you can find at your local hobby store, and the characters protrayed by the actors seem to spend the majority of their time fighting among themselves rather than the elements that threaten their lives on the moonbase.  Likewise, the actors portraying the American team are quite laughable with their forced and embarassing ""southern"" accents (Why do the British insist that every American must sound like a untalented and shoddy understudy of Big Daddy in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof?"")

Donald Houston is admirable as the commander of this troupe of generally unknown British actors (with the exception of Ralph Bates from the Hammer horror films), with haircuts that seem more appropriate for a amateur production of Shakespeare's ""Richard III."" Notwithstanding the interesting premise that producer Gerry Anderson would turn into a short-lived and dubious success a year later with ""Space 1999,"" ""Moonbase 3"" is clearly an also ran in the annals of British sci-fi, appropriately regulated to the void of deep space.",1160524800,4,2063,5.094674556213017
