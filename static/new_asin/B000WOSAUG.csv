2988366,2,B000WOSAUG,I was not impressed with this.  I love Denise Austin's workouts but this one I was wishing the whole time it was over. I don't know it wasn't as fun and energetic as her other ones.,1200614400,2,181,4.027777777777778
2988367,4,B000WOSAUG,"For some reason, I thought that this DVD contained four complete cardio workouts, so I was disappointed to find out that it only contained four 10 minute segments (in addition to the warm-up and cool-down, which are each about 5 minutes).  As for the workouts themselves, each segment is a mix of high and low impact, but I work out a lot and mostly do higher impact cardio, so I found this to be more on the low-impact side (for me).  With the first two segments that I did (kick box and athletic intervals), I barely broke a sweat.  The retro aerobics segment starts out on the slow side, but for the last five minutes it's almost all high impact.

I haven't gotten into Denise's DVDs in the past because I found her bubbly personality to be a bit much for me, but on this DVD, she is pretty toned down, as other reviewers have said.  She's still enthusiastic, but not annoying.  And as other reviewers have noted, her cueing is pretty bad (she tells you what she's going to do next as she already has started to do it), but the moves are not so complex that you can't get the hang of them once you do the workouts a few times.  The variety of the workouts is nice as well - if you set it up as a complete 30-40 minute workout, it doesn't really get boring because you switch between different types of workouts.",1200355200,2,1314,4.295546558704453
2988368,5,B000WOSAUG,I really like Denise & don't find her to be annoying.  Her cueing is always off but after you do a workout a few times you know the routine anyways so by then it doesnt matter.  I really love this DVD.  If you do all 4 of the 10 mins workouts  you keep changing what you are doing & don't get tired of the same type moves.  I agree w/a previous reviewer that  it is nice that this one is purely cardio and no weights.,1200096000,,417,3.847058823529412
2988369,5,B000WOSAUG,"I really like her videos and I have been WAITING for a dvd like this from her. I have been repeating her dvds to get an hour out of them and that is difficult and I never got all I could out of my home workouts as a result...not to mention a pain....but it seems that workout dvds are common in they are short...but this one is different. You can add up to four workouts in any order and have them just start over if you want to. Now this is what I am talking about. This will cut my time by a bit and keep my heart rate up!!

If you like Denise's routines but wish they were longer...try this video out! You can even turn the voice off and have only music...I like my own music but it is a matter of preference.",1200009600,,712,3.910344827586207
2988370,5,B000WOSAUG,"I bought this DVD yesterday and I was so excited to try it out.  Denise Austin really toned it down for this one!  She was still smiley and motivating, but she wasn't over the top.  I really like that the workout is broken down into 10 minute segments because it had enough variety to keep me interesed. She's not the most convincing kick boxer, but she pulled it off.  The dance section was MUCH better than her Cardio Dance & Sculpt DVD.  I was sweating by the end of it.  I really like that this DVD is purely cardio and doesn't have weights section.

There are a couple things that other people might not like.  For the high impact moves she would give you a modification for lower impact but no one actually did it (at least that I saw, but I might be wrong on that.)The modifications were really similar to what she was doing or a previous step as she increased the intensity, so she didn't leave people completely in the dark. Her cuing was better, but especially in the beginning she cued as she was doing the move so it was a little hard to follow.  The next time I do the DVD it won't be a problem though.

All in all it was a good, fun workout with lots of variety.",1199404800,21,1176,4.1866666666666665
2988371,5,B000WOSAUG,"I am a guy and enjoy having the option of popping in a video instead of a trip to the gym.  Denise has created a workout where you can mix and match and get a great workout right at home.  Excellent for individuals with busy lifestyles, including us guys!  Go Denise!",1198454400,11,267,4.196078431372549

2988388,4,B000WOSAUG,"I enjoy this DVD because of the variety of workouts, the interval as well as the retro sessions.  Since the DVD will not play in the DVD player because there is no remote, I carry this DVD with me and play on laptop, and it really gives me a blood pumping exercise.  I have lost 2 inches off my waist!",1431302400,,301,4.0

2988390,3,B000WOSAUG,"This cardio DVD is pretty boring with repetitive steps throughout all the 4 different 10 minute workouts, so that all of them appear the same! Do not trust on this alone to lose weight. However this dvd supplemented with a regular walk/jog and the right diet can do the trick!",1429920000,,276,4.54
2988391,5,B000WOSAUG,I love Denise Austin.  I love that the DVDs can be played in a manner to help you customize your workout and her positive attitude will help keep you going when you just want to stop.,1425168000,,183,4.083333333333333
2988392,5,B000WOSAUG,Great for medium fitness level. The change of routines is nice too. No over and over again moves like the old aerobics.  I also like the fact that you can change intensity of workout from beginner all the way up to an advanced medium intensity. If I don't get my running miles in I will do this workout instead.,1423267200,,311,4.271186440677966

2988408,5,B000WOSAUG,I like this DVD because of the variety of workouts 4 x 10 mins workouts + 5 mins warm up and 5 mins cool down.,1410134400,,110,3.44
2988409,4,B000WOSAUG,"I do this routine on Prime video, more than my other videos. The routines are simple and easy to follow, and she makes it fun! She motivates you in a positive way. The sets are broken up into interval sessions, so you get little breaks. Each one is only like 8-10 minutes long, so they go quick and easy to swallow vs a whole 60 minute session, so if you get the DVD you can choose which one to do. Some are more intense than others. For example, there's a dance set that's entirely low-impact, last one is stretch out. I didn't want to do a Zumba or hip hop thing, because frankly those are crazy and annoying to me. This is not that, it gets you moving and I usually modify the routine based on how intense I would like. I can't get mad at her, even though she's Malibu barbie and so cute - because she makes it cheerful and says she's proud of you, you're burning fat. Do what you can, and not like pressuring you. It may be crap because I haven't done anything all week and ate ice cream last night, but I can't help but feel good anyway!",1409270400,,1042,4.112745098039215
2988410,4,B000WOSAUG,I love how it's not complicated and she mixes it up. My heart rate was up the whole time!,1409011200,,89,3.736842105263158
2988411,1,B000WOSAUG,I am surprised that so many people thought this video was easy to follow and good for beginners.  I could not keep up with this workout simply because she changed the moves too quickly and didn't give any countdown to the next move.  I prefer the Leslie Sansone and Jillian Michaels workouts.  I also found Denise Austin's voice to be way too soothing and gentle for during a workout.,1408406400,,384,4.536231884057971
2988412,3,B000WOSAUG,Can be a tad difficult to get the steps down but its a fun workout. It's upbeat and has a good pace to keep you going.,1408406400,,118,3.576923076923077
2988423,5,B000WOSAUG,AWESOME,1407974400,,7,7.0
2988424,4,B000WOSAUG,"Personally, I like Denise Austin.  Her videos have varied moves so you don't get bored and I feel like I had a good workout when done.  They do not involve superhuman moves.  I have seen other reviewers who don't seem to like what seems to be a nice encouraging person with a softer voice.  But if you like the drill sergeant type, that is what Jillian Michael's is for.  I am a 50+ in fairly good shape who wants to stay that way.",1407801600,,431,4.144578313253012
2988425,5,B000WOSAUG,I love Denise Austin after trying her workouts on my Prime instant video set up and now exercise to three of  her dvds plus Mary Helen Bowers ballet workouts also on prime. Denise is fun and I love fun! I had heard negative things about her being over the top peppy so stayed away but then had an injury from doing insanity so by accident thought I would try Denise and I am now hooked as I am working out and having fun and not killing myself. I do not know why people get so upset at people who are happy and upbeat and it is a sad reflection on todays society that people like Denise and myself are criticized and ridiculed by all the mean and unhappy people. By nature I am bubbly and happy and my life is good and Denise adds to that happiness and sets a good example. Maybe if more people danced with Denise there would be less meanness in the world and the cranky would leave us happy people alone. I cannot believe the reviews that really demean her instead of saying hat its not my cup of tea they have to trash her. I highly recommend this and remember that it takes time to learn any routine and when you went to college you didn't walk out of class because you didn't remember everything the first time. Also what a gorgous woman she is especially as she is 57! She looks 30! Love her!,1406678400,2,1297,4.1673306772908365

2988429,4,B000WOSAUG,"I really enjoyed this.  It kept my blood pumping and my mind busy as it was difficult enough for me to have to work at it, but not so difficult that I wanted to give up.  I also really liked that there were four distinctly different segments to this, including both a kickboxing and a dance segment, that made it fun.  The only thing I would have liked would have been a short segment at the end for muscle toning.",1403740800,,414,4.15
2988430,5,B000WOSAUG,I really like these workouts. There are four separate workouts to choose from plus a warmup and cool down. I like the diversity of the workouts and feel them working as I'm moving. Great fun and I will continue doing them.,1403568000,,222,4.439024390243903
2988431,5,B000WOSAUG,i like the workout it challenges me.  some workouts i have done make we worry about getting injured during the workout because of some of the moves but this one does have any sections where I worry about this.  very good!!!,1403308800,,223,4.414634146341464
2988432,5,B000WOSAUG,"Wow, it was my first experience with her workout video and I loved it! I'm on week 8 on my diet now and I have been exercising 10-15 hours a week and have lost a bit of weight. I thought I was fit but man, this workout totally made me sweat. It was great because it has three different segments with kickboxing, aerobics, and dancing. They are all very fun. I am not very good at Latin dancing so I struggled with steps a little but you know what, it doesn't matter as long as you do your best! :) I will be doing this video again!",1403136000,,531,3.97196261682243

2988434,3,B000WOSAUG,"this is a good video, but some parts are a bit too hard for me, so I don't get full value from it.  Also, using it on Prime does not allow me to choose the section I want to do - instead I have to fast forward through the unwanted sections.",1401840000,,240,3.7058823529411766
2988435,4,B000WOSAUG,"It was a fun cardio workout that could be challenging if you pushed yourself.
I did find it a little too happy but not so much that I needed to turn it off.",1401494400,,156,3.757575757575758
2988436,4,B000WOSAUG,"Overall, this is a fun workout video. However, Denise Austin does not cue you well, and the intensity can be lacking at times.",1400889600,,126,4.521739130434782
2988437,5,B000WOSAUG,"I was not a fan of Denise Austin in the past, but after many many years, I've decided to give her a try. Well, I love this workout! I am now a huge fan!  Go Denise Austin!!!",1400457600,,173,3.675675675675676
2988438,4,B000WOSAUG,Love that it's broken into 4 10 minute segments - makes the workout go by quicker!  Another hit from the ever optimistic Denise Austin!,1399852800,,135,4.625
2988439,4,B000WOSAUG,I like the variety of the workout and that I can do 15 minutes or the whole hour as it is divided into four sections.,1399852800,,117,3.72
2988440,5,B000WOSAUG,"I am not a person who is good at exercise videos  (or working out)--specifically because there's choreography but Denise makes it super easy. She goes over the steps slowly and verbalizes as she does the exercise. She is positive and upbeat, which is exactly what I need in order to get into shape after having my second child. Great for beginners getting into working out :)",1399593600,,375,4.681818181818182
2988441,5,B000WOSAUG,I really loved it! It's fun to do all at once or in 10 min cardio blasts through the day.,1399420800,,89,3.5
2988442,5,B000WOSAUG,I enjoy doing this video.  Denise is always upbeat and encouraging.  Lots of variety of moves so you don't get bored.,1397692800,,117,4.523809523809524
2988462,5,B000WOSAUG,High energy and fun. It keeps you moving for about an hour without making you feel exhausted. Worth using over and aver,1396828800,,119,4.454545454545454
2988463,5,B000WOSAUG,This workout doesn't let you become flabby. Keeps you moving without killing you. You can do all 4 @ once if you have time or break it down and do one before work.,1396569600,,163,3.9696969696969697
2988464,5,B000WOSAUG,Denise Austin is a favorite and has proven that exercising and being fit is rewarding. I followed her for a number of years.,1396396800,,124,4.434782608695652
2988465,5,B000WOSAUG,Each short workout can be used to get your blood moving first thing in the morning or combine them all for a full odd workout! Denise is amazing!,1396396800,,145,4.214285714285714
2988466,4,B000WOSAUG,This is a good cardio workout that doesn't require you to do cartwheels and hand stands to get throught it,1395619200,,106,4.35
2988467,4,B000WOSAUG,Not extremely difficult but a good workout.  Fun!  I like the way it has 4 different workouts in one.  Keeps my attention.,1394928000,,122,4.454545454545454
2988468,5,B000WOSAUG,Great workout for all ages.  Denise is very motivating.  I found the moves were easy to learn and the workout could be as easy or hard as you want.,1394668800,,147,4.0344827586206895
2988469,4,B000WOSAUG,"Great exercise/ High impact and lots of fun.
It is based on moves derived from skating, kickboxing, volleyball and so on.",1394582400,2,121,4.809523809523809
2988470,2,B000WOSAUG,"I am in average shape, im a normal person that can do almost any workout video: with that said,here's my review...
PROS
She has good energy and encourages you as if she was with you. But that has more to do with whether you like Denise Austin, which I do. I just don't like this video.
CONS
Choreography wasn't good, some of the moves were either weird or hard to do
Assumes you know dance terms like ""box step"", it would've been helpful if she  showed us how to do it first
The retro aerobics, and cardio dance were my least favorite parts of the video. She rushes to much through the moves.

The funny thing is I noticed how this is the first time I ever saw an asian girl in an exercise video. Why is that? Did it take all these years to show some diversity in exercise videos?? Its about time! I thought that was good.
I like how she picks a variety of people to be in her workouts.",1394150400,,886,4.115606936416185
2988471,5,B000WOSAUG,This a great 1 hour workout for the whole family. Don't have to do exactly what they do on the first day itself. You will get there gradually. Needs patience. Even the kids love it...,1394150400,,183,4.257142857142857
2988482,2,B000WOSAUG,"Jillian Michaels used to drive me nuts - I found her brash and annoying.  However, I recently put my money where my mouth was & started using some of her DVDs and found out that she's an amazing trainer & motivator.
I tried adding this Denise Austin cardio workout to my workout rotation, but it drove me crazy.  Denise Austin just doesn't motivate me - she has a breathy voice and chatters on ""you can do it"" over and over without any real directions or focus on form.  I found that I really need that hard core voice & motivation that Jillian Michaels provides...Denise Austin was uninspiring to me.",1394150400,,601,4.495412844036697
2988483,1,B000WOSAUG,Gave this a try after working out to Jillian for two months.  Denise Austin's personality will make you want to run from the room screaming.  She also probably had too much caffeine before shooting this video because she is going so fast that not even the dancers can keep up.  My heart rate did not come up at all during this workout and I hardly broke a sweat.  It is also too fast to get any kind of form down and she doesn't tell you what is coming up so by the time you figure out what she is doing she's on to a new move and you're behind again.  I will definitely be sticking to Jillian after this one!,1394064000,3,609,4.041666666666667
2988484,5,B000WOSAUG,I can do this workout in my living room and it gets my heart pumping and gives me energy for the entire day.,1394064000,,108,3.739130434782609
2988485,4,B000WOSAUG,"pros:

-I love a lot of her videos and her episodes from Fit TV in the 90's.  Her genuine enthusiasm, good explanations, and encouragement are excellent as always
- good reminders throughout about good form, how to take a 'moving break', etc.  She's a pro, it shows.
- really helps motivate me that she's in great shape in a natural way, which is my goal. She really shows the results of healthy eating and lifestyle.
- fun moves, once you figure out what's coming next.
- fun workout, was fun to do and mixed in new and older moves for variety!!

cons:
-I'm in good shape, yet it's a killer workout without warning you first.  expectations should be set better in the intro
- would prefer less constant changes to the moves.  I'd rather concentrate on good form than wondering about the next move.",1393804800,,798,4.506944444444445
2988486,4,B000WOSAUG,I always liked are workouts. They are not to difficult to follow . I can grow with the the exercise program,1393804800,,107,4.142857142857143
2988487,3,B000WOSAUG,"This workout can get our heart rate up, especially for beginner to intermediate.  The way she jumps through different moves keeps the interest up, but is a bit frustrating if you are new to aerobics.  I will say her cuing is horrible.  A good aerobics instructor will cue up the next move in the 2-4 counts before the next move...not right as you need to do the move.  I found myself having to make up some moves in between to keep my heart rate up.",1393718400,,449,4.247058823529412
2988488,5,B000WOSAUG,"I can see where other people might find it too easy if they are really fit which I'm not.  But as a friend told me once who does P90X, you can make any exercise program more challenging on your own.  That said, I like Denise -- I tried her out after my dismal failure w/Jillian Michaels. Yeah, Denise is too much sunshine sometimes but I think it's genuine (or she's a good actress).  I can overlook that for Jillian Michaels' poor attempt at humor, bullying faade, etc.",1393632000,,470,4.379310344827586
2988489,5,B000WOSAUG,"I used to swim for 1.5 hours almost every day, run, lift weights, bike, and then I had twins.  Kids, life, work, etc really took over after that.  Now, 9 years later I am back to try exercising again at age 45.  I am not very out of shape, I still walk the dog, go hiking with the kids but have not taken time out just for ME to exercise.  I have been doing this cardio-blast program for the last week every day.  First starting with 2 workouts and moving up to all 4.  They are fun and keep me interested and engaged.  The moves are easy enough that a lot of talk is unnecessary to keep up.  I dislike doing exercises/routines where one needs a MFA in dance to understand what is going on.  ""Keep it simple and fun"" is my motto, and that is what this video does.  My knees are bad so I don't bounce or jump but keep my heart rate up by doing marches or something low impact while the cross country skiing is going on.  I look forward to doing this routine and even catch myself doing a few of the exercises throughout my day as the spirit moves me.  Denise is great in this video and it is motivating to know that she was around 50 when this video came out.  Gives me hope that I will get my waistline back!

UPDATE: 4/30/14  After 2-3 weeks of doing this entire workout 4-5 times a week my clothes were fitting more loosely, especially around the waist and thighs.  A little over 1 month after starting my 'muffin tops' (ugh!) had almost disappeared.  The scale indicates I have lost 3 lbs, but I think I have added muscle and shed fat.  My body does look more lean and toned.  I find Denise amusing, goofy and I enjoy spending time with her.

I like that the workouts are 10-15 minutes and then on to something else so you won't get bored. But the moves are very basic and Denise seems a little ""off"" in this video. Like she threw this together real fast just to get a DVD out. I sweated a little....",1391040000,,408,4.243589743589744
2988508,5,B000WOSAUG,"This is a fun workout with a lot of variety. The segments are warm up, kickboxing (pretty low intensity for kickboxing), sports interval training (some volleyball moves, bit of tire drill, and the bow & arrow bit I always think of as 'the Katniss"", yeah i'm a dork), retro aerobics (fun!), dance (with a bit of latin inspiration), cool down.

I'd say its a low/medium-intensity workout. If you are just beginning this is a good place to start. Also good to rotate it in with other workouts which are a bit more difficult, but repetitive (I like Turbo Jam the best).  If you are already doing Turbo Fire or P90x or something like that, this will be like a walk in the park in comparison.",1391040000,,686,4.48
2988509,4,B000WOSAUG,"I really enjoyed this workout! This video is comprised of a warm up, a cool down and four 10-minute workout segments.

I appreciated the amount of variety Denise Austin incorporates. The 10-minute segments cover low impact kickboxing, sports drills, old school aerobics (think Richard Simmons) and aerobic dance. By breaking things up, the workout stays fun and time seems to pass quickly.

Some reviewers mentioned cueing issues. Although Austin's cueing does leave something to be desired, I don't think this presents a real issue until the final aerobic dance segment. Austin's cueing goes downhill here and she wears dark pants which make it difficult to discern what each move should look like!

The terms of intensity, I would say that this video provides a low to moderately challenging aerobic workout. I'm 8 months pregnant and still able to complete this video with only minor modifications. Once baby arrives, I'll likely keep this workout in my queue for days when I desire a lower impact, cardio driven workout.

Enjoy!",1390953600,,1032,5.125

I would recommend this dvd to anyone who is just starting out, or who wants to get that New Years resolution in gear. The work outs on this dvd are easy, and you can set the pace of what you want to do, and how much. Also the price was great for a Denise Austin dvd so win/win.",1390435200,,646,3.7573529411764706

Denise's outfit keeps changing. LOL. You can't help but smile when you work out with Denise. She's like, ""Come on! This is fun, enjoy yourself! do the best that YOU can.""

2988536,2,B000WOSAUG,"This workout is one reason why I stopped using workout videos so many years ago.  I don't disagree that these moves will get your heart rate up; they definitely do.  But Denise insists that you do each exercise at such a ridiculously fast pace that it's impossible to keep proper form to any of them.  Not that she seems to care about form - she gives zero instruction in that area, making this workout an injury (or five) waiting to happen.  The kickboxing and ""athletics""-inspired moves on the surface seem ideal, but they only resemble the actual moves in name.  If you've ever participated in any of the actual activities, you'll recognize the difference (partly because she Denise asks you to do them so friggin FAST).  You feel like you're just flinging your arms and legs around without any precision and without really targeting any of your muscles.  You'd get the same kind of workout from just dancing with like a five-year-old.
Adding to the frustration is the fact that Denise has music going in the background, but she doesn't seem to be listening to it while she's running through the routines - the exercises are constantly off-rhythm, making it really frustrating to the exerciser who doesn't know whether to follow the pace of the music or the pace of the people on screen.",1375401600,,1290,4.732142857142857

My 5 year old wanted to workout with me, so I let her and the first words out of her mouth were, ""Mom, why is this lady talking like that?"" Yes, Denise, in her chipper way, is a bit too chipper, but a lot of people like that, but I am one to like a more direct/tougher approach when it comes to the instructor.  I like a bit more of a challenge in a workout too, so for me, this wasn't a great matchup, but would be a great video for someone just starting their weight loss journey.  I did sweat a bit though, so I know some calories were burned, so maybe if I need to feel loved during my workout sometime, I'll turn it back on ;)",1366502400,,761,3.9607843137254903
2988556,3,B000WOSAUG,"As a caveat; I am not a fitness expert or instructor. I'm a middle age male trying to improve burn some fat & improve my conditioning while traveling (I don't like running).

I can't speak for women, but this is not a great video for men.  (It appears, in retrospect, to have been targeted to women; all the people in the video are women & there are quite a few feminine moves, such as the ""curtsy."")

Certainly, there are men who can move their hips & enjoy dancing.  I'm not one of them.  If you can move like Ricky Martin, more power to you, feel free to dance along.  If dancing makes you feel a little awkward, then I'd recommend trying one of her boot camp videos.

I would categorize this as mild-moderate intensity. It is quite a bit less intense than Denise Austin's Boot Camp, & way, way less intense than P90x,etc.  I think the title of Burn Fat Fast Cardio Blast is a little deceptive.  The intensity level is roughly on par with a fast paced walk.  Any exercise is much better than none at all, but I wouldn't expect the fat to ""burn fast"" with this routine.

While it lacks intensity, it requires a moderate (or better) amount of aerobic exercise type coordination.  A lot of the moves took me some time to catch on - I would typically start to get it down just as it was moving on to the next set.  Other reviewers have pointed out the cues are usually given AFTER the new move has begun, leaving first time viewers, such as myself, in a constant state of trying to catch up.

I would NOT recommend this if you are:
1) Hoping for an intense P90x or Insanity style workout
2) Experiencing serious joint issues (it's moderate impact)
4) Desiring a slow/gradual workout. This one isn't real fast, but requires some coordination & timing (more than p90x, for example).
5) Addicted to pushups & situps (there are none)
6) Wanting to bulk up (the heaviest thing you lift is yourself (when doing squats/knee bends)).

I would recommend this to women (or dancing men) who exercise occasionally but aren't in great shape, who would like a mild workout or who are interested in stepping up to the next level of aerobic video moves. You need to be quite mobile & coordinated.

Its true what they say, your metabolism slows down after age 30, especially for me since I'm not an outdoor enthusiast. Recently I decided to buy a few exercise dvds to help me lose the weight, and decided to look for Denise Austin since I remember doing her vhs tapes when I was a teenager. I am glad I did because I've already lost 5lbs in the first 2 weeks. At first the cardio blast was hard to keep up with because I'm not very coordinated, but each time I do it, I catch on to the moves a little better.

2988579,5,B000WOSAUG,"I almost bypassed this workout completely based on some of the reviews, but I'm glad I didn't!  I did this streaming, but I think it would make a great DVD to own.  I like the way she offers 4 different 10(ish) minute segments that you could mix and match so the video doesn't become boring.  You never have to do 30+ minutes of the same thing.  Yes, she does do the moves quickly, but remember, this is not a class--the faster pace is so that when you go back and redo the DVD you don't get bored with the constant slowed-down explanations of each move.  It may be slightly frustrating the first go round, but as long as you keep moving, it doesn't really matter if you do the moves perfectly, you'll still get a workout.

Others commented that this was low-key, or not meant for anyone in shape.  I don't agree--I've been a fitness buff for years (and even taught classes for a bit in college), so I'm quite fit, but I still got a great workout.  Not every workout has to make you feel miserable to be effective!  This is meant to be fat-burning cardio, and it will definitely get your heart-rate in that zone, especially if you do the moves full out like Denise does.  At the same time, it is still approachable for a beginner, especially since you can choose to do shorter segments.  Overall, I thought that it was a great basic cardio workout for all levels, and is fun enough that you will actually WANT to do it.",1357776000,2,1419,4.337121212121212

Thank you for sending me the DVD of Denise Austin.
Unfortunatelly, I was not be able to use it, as it has only an American Reading Code and not an European One.
I kindly ask you to send me an European Code or to let me know how can I get one.

Awaiting for your answer,

2988591,5,B000WOSAUG,I just want you to know this is an easy work out and fun fun fun it allows you to pick your work out how you want it and how long you spend on it. I think this is very easy to use for anyone I personally use it with my 12 year old son. My favorite is the kick boxing as well as the dance. I am by no means a health nut or in awesome physical shape. this is good for those who are starting bck up exercise. so I LOVE IT.,1296345600,2,419,3.4680851063829787

I love that you have four choices, you can do only one section or all four if you feel like it.  The kickboxing is a great workout and I totally love the Cardio Dance.  I could Mambo all night if it keeps burning off the calories!  I'll buy more of her DVD's in the future!",1295827200,,431,4.023529411764706

I love the different options (kickboxing, dance, retro aerobics, etc.) that this video offers and it really gets my heart beating.  At first, it may seem hard to follow but does get easier with each use.  I also like the fact that you can customize your work-outs so that you never get bored.",1291852800,2,395,4.614285714285714
2988595,4,B000WOSAUG,"This is a good fitness video to have in your collection.  The biggest plus is that the DVD includes 4 different workouts- each of them is 10 minutes long.  This allows you to pick and choose and customize your workout. You can do all 4 or you can do one of them 4 times, or if you're pressed for time, just do 2 of the workouts. Also, the workouts are varied, which I enjoyed. The kickboxing and retroaerobics got my heart rate up the most. The athletic intervals was interesting, but there was too much stop and go to get my heart rate into that fat-burning zone. The cardio dance was fun, but not intense enough if fat burn and weight loss are your goals. Of course, if you're a beginner, the workout doesn't have to be that intense to get results. Overall, I recommend this video to anyone interested in being fit.",1288051200,,817,4.333333333333333

2988597,3,B000WOSAUG,"When I bought this DVD, I had read a couple of reviews that said it was an easy to learn video and not confusing like her aerobic dance.  I like her Pilates video, so I thought I would give this one a shot for some cardio exercise.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT for those who are uncoordinated.  She never lets you know what she is doing ahead of time ,and then she does it quickly and doesn't show you how to do it.  She also strings together whole routines of these moves and doesn't give any forewaring.  I will not be using this video anymore; I'm going back to my Leslie Sansone walking videos!

In the last year, I have been on a journey to lose a significant amount of weight, so I figured I would try this to switch up my workouts.  The sound quality was awful, adding to the frustration I felt trying to keep up the cues that were too quick (in my opinion)",1264550400,3,386,4.133333333333334

I really wasn't into the girlie stuff but tried Denise because I wanted to do something different with my muscles.  I thought she would be too easy after working out with Billy but I was WRONG!!!  She wears me out.  And I love the way she divides her workouts into 10 or 20 minutes.  It seems to make the workout go faster because I don't get bored.  I will most certainly continue to order her DVD's.,1257897600,3,480,4.096774193548387

The dvd's has soem variety for the different dance styles which is nice.  I agree with another viewer that the cueing is totally off.  It took a couple times of using the dvd to know where I was going when.  The moves are easy and the pace a bit slower than I would have imagined.  You really have to put yourself into the workout to get what you need from it.  I liked Denises attitude in the dvd.  She is toned down but still perky.  I need perky sometimes, especially in the morning when I'm try to get the bootie moving.  I was somewhat unimpressed with the studio setup and the backup being out of synch.

Normally I like something that i can pop in, it will give me a decent cardio workout and at the end I feel as if I've accomplished something. If you feel the same, then this is not the video for you. There is no intructional portion to familiarize yourself with the moves before hand, you have to figure it out as you go. By the time I watch to see what foot they're starting on, the full body movement, and get the hang of that move, she's onto the next step, where again, I have to figure out what she's doing. I spend more time watching the video than actually moving. Definately not something you can just jump into and have fun. If all her videos are put together this way, I will definately not be buying another one",1244678400,3,759,4.170068027210885
2988607,3,B000WOSAUG,"I bought this because I needed to do some cardio exercise. This seemed like a good DVD because of the variety and the fact that each segment is only 10 minutes. I like that you can mix and match which segments you want to do, and I admit it gets my heart pumping. But the cues are difficult to follow because Denise jumps into another move without any warning. I feel like I'm not getting the full effect of the workout because I'm concentrating on trying to follow her moves. Also, her routines are only ok. I really enjoy the kickboxing one but the other ones have some weird moves that I have trouble following (especially Cardio Dance).",1242604800,4,640,4.432203389830509

2988614,2,B000WOSAUG,"This was my first Denise Austin video and WOW was I disappointed!  Being new to Denise Austin, I found her a very annoying instructor (her voice sounds like she is trying to be sexy).  Her cueing was terrible (even the other girls behind her made numerous mistakes) and the choreography was a mess.  Her counts were never the same.  I bought this video because after reading many reviews I thought Denise was a great instructor and could really take my body to the next level.  That will not happen with this video.  The first time I viewed it, I tried all four 10  minute sections and I knew this will not be a DVD I use a lot.  The first two sections were pretty good and I worked up a little sweat, then I did the second two sections.  Don't waste your time.  Why do instructors think Mambo's, Grapevines and any other baby step movement will give you a good cardio workout?  The last two sections were a big waste of time.  The good thing about the way this DVD works is you may customize it to play whatever 10  minute interval you want.  So now I play the Kickboxing section twice and the Cardio Interval twice to give me a decent 50 minute workout.  If you want a great Interval Heart Pumping workout try Jillian Michaels.  She makes you feel like you have a personal trainer in your home.",1215129600,,1296,4.3375
2988615,5,B000WOSAUG,"This is a great, fun workout. It will make you sweat and it will give you great results. Denise is fun as always. I know alot of people say that she drives them nuts, but I personaly think she is very good at what she does. This DVD  lets you interchange 4 different workouts. It has a 5 minute warm up and a 5 minute cool down. All the workouts are fun and very easy to learn. I usually do the warm up, 2 workouts then the cool down. Nothing better than staying in my own home and not having to go to a stinky gym and workout!!!!",1213056000,2,530,3.9074074074074074

2988617,5,B000WOSAUG,"This is a good workout for burning fat. Although I have to admit its not for beginers. Denise is not very efficient when it comes to queing, as a result the movements change just when you're getting used to it. However each segment is designed to workout on different muscle groups, plus its good for the heart. I would recommend this dvd for intermediate level.",1210118400,,362,4.584615384615384

I read tons of reviews before deciding to purchase but I am glad I ignored the personal comments about Denise; I actually like her. I believe she is a genuine and upbeat person. I love the kick boxing routine, it makes you pump your heart up... (and works your abs nicely!)If you are really out of shape you may find this one difficult but you can keep it up until you can master the moves; it really worth it! I was not very thrilled about the retro-aerobics dance routine and the latin moves since they require a lot more coordination than the first two routines. I still do these for a change, it just a matter of personal preference; it works out your entire body, no question! The music is not the best but works for the routines. Also it has the option of turning off Denise's instruction so you can only hear the music (I've read lots of people dislike her voice!). I truly recommend this DVD, I do these routines 4 times a week and the rest of the week I do ""Hit the Spot"" -Core and Abs-, also from Denise Austin.",1210032000,,1104,4.212264150943396

2988620,3,B000WOSAUG,"This isn't a bad workout, really, but there are some things you should be aware of when considering whether or not to buy it.  The biggest problem for me was all of the jumping around.  It would be fine in a gym, but I live in an upstairs apartment and just can't make that much of a ruckus.  So if you have the space and can take the high-impact, no problem.  However, if you have bad knees or live upstairs, this workout is almost certainly not for you.

My other problem with this dvd was that the workouts were so diverse in nature, I just couldn't get into a rhythm with them.  It would be wonderful for someone limited on time who just wants to do a section here and there when they can squeeze it in - it would make for great variety.  However, if you're looking to do a longer workout in one segment, I found it very difficult to ""switch gears"" from one workout to the next.

This COULD be a good workout depending on your needs.  For me, it ended up on ebay.",1207094400,16,967,4.128342245989304
2988630,3,B000WOSAUG,"I thought that this was not a great exercise video.  I did like the Kickboxing portion, but that was it.  Everything else seemed too fast, she sped through everything, and kind of looked disorganized.  I love Denise and have about 10 of her DVD's, but this was a disappointment and a flop. I tried it for the first time, and it was my last time.",1206748800,,345,4.276923076923077
2988631,4,B000WOSAUG,"This is one of those exercise programs that let you pick and choose the length of your workout.  It consists of 4 diffrent 10 minute workouts (Kickboxing, Cardio Dance, Athletic Interval and Retro Aerobics) as well as a 5 minute warm-up and 5 minute cool-down.  As a high intermediate to advanced home exerciser, I find this DVD to be a lot of fun and quite effective as a workout.(I do the entire 50 minutes). True, it is not the HARDEST exercise routine out there, but it is still challenging. It packs a lot of variety, you NEVER stop moving and you will sweat and burn quite a bit of calories! I really like the music in this one, and it's great that the DVD comes with a music-only option.  Denise is not the best cuer, so initially there will be some confusion, but within a few repetitions, you will not need her to tell you what comes next. All in all, a fun and upbeat exercise routine!

The cueing is bad; I'm not sure if it gets better later in the workout or if I just got used to it.  Overall, it is fun.",1202688000,,399,4.116883116883117

Not that it is that difficult it isn't - Denise's calls are so far off - she is just about to the next move when she calls the one she is almost done with. Or so it seems. It is a shame this is a nice work out - the 10 segmants keeps the pace and does not get boring. If you do this a few times and get a feel for what Denise is going to do next - you will end up with a very nice workout that can work you into a sweat if you bump the moves up a tad.,1202515200,,514,3.439655172413793

2988635,4,B000WOSAUG,Denise Austin has never been one of my favorite instructions.  Too peppy & poor cueing (she calls late!).  But pure cardio dvd's seem hard to find so I gave this one a try and wasn't disappointed.  I am an advanced to intermediate exerciser and find that if I just modify some of the moves during the workout I can get my heartrate where it needs to be.  I especially enjoyed the retro section the moves reminded me of Denise's early days with some Jane Fonda and Kathy Smith thrown in.  I think if you give this dvd a chance you will get results with doing it.,1202342400,,561,4.254716981132075
2988636,2,B000WOSAUG,"I'm not usually a huge Denise Austin fan (something about her voice and ""perkiness"" just doesn't work well for me especially in the mornings!) but I do have a couple of her other videos, so I decided to give this one a try.  Unfortunately, I should have saved my money.  What I did like about the DVD was that you could mix and match your workout routine before you started the video so you could move from one workout to the next without stopping.  You can choose from a short warm up (10 mins. or less) 4 different 10 min. or so workouts, and a quick cool down (again, 10 mins. or less.)  At the beginning of each workout, she does a ""mini"" warm up, which I think is redundant since there's already a warm up at the beginning of the video and it only serves to allow your heart rate to drop back down (if it got up in the first place.)  The kickboxing routine is a series of kicks and punches, good for someone who has never kickboxed before but not difficult at all.  The ""athletic interval"" training is not true aerobic intervals.  Instead, she teaches various moves that mimic movements from other sports.  The retro 80s workout will not have any of your favorite 80s songs, but it does have moves that are reminiscent of the leotard and legwarmers era.  Lastly, the dance section does have some ""dancy"" moves that you should catch on to easily after just a couple times doing them.  All in all, the variety is good, and it's very easy to follow, but I did not feel like I got a great workout.  My heartrate did not elevate very much at all, and I barely broke a sweat (of course working out in a freezing cold basement in the winter helps that!)  If you are a beginner exerciser who gets bored easily, this is a good video for you.  If you've been exercising for a while and you're looking for a challenge, try something else.",1201651200,25,1832,4.321637426900585
2988637,5,B000WOSAUG,"After having some health issues in 2007, I tried to get back to exercising with advanced dvds right away.  I was becoming very frustrated and a friend suggested I try some Denise Austin to get back in the swing of things.  I used to love Denise but had advanced beyond her workouts.  This dvd is perfect and I am so glad I tried it!  I can do all the segments or just one, depending on how I feel.  Denise's cueing leaves a bit to be desired, but if you like Denise you can look past that because this is really a lot of fun.  She is lower key in this dvd than in some others but still friendly and motivating.  Her personality and enthusiam is just what I needed at this time.  I enjoy all the segments but am partial to the retro aerobics section...I love it!",1201219200,25,761,4.129251700680272
2988638,4,B000WOSAUG,"Denise Austin usually drives me nuts.  I can't handle the whole perky aerobics instructor thing.  However, I took the plunge because I was drawn to the different styles of cardio offered on this DVD and because a lot of reviewers said Denise really toned it down in this one.  Turns out, Denise really DID tone it down.  She's friendly, low-key, and very pleasant in this.  The different cardio sections are very fun, especially the Retro aerobics.  I don't know why I got such a kick out of this one, but it just flowed smoothly with fun moves.  The kickboxing was good, though a little fast moving if you've never done these moves before.  In the interval section, there is a lot of jumping in the last few minutes so make sure to wear a good sports bra!  I couldn't get through the dance cardio, honestly.  But that's no fault of Denise and I knew when I bought the DVD that I probably wouldn't like it.  Dancey cardio is not my thing; I'm too clumsy.  But, since the DVD is chaptered so beautifully, I don't have to do it!

As far as intensity goes, don't expect an over the top sweat fest.  You get out what you put into it, of course, but I wouldn't recommend this to people who are in good shape.  You'll probably be bored.  I'm not in great shape, but not just starting out either and I got up a decent sweat.  It would be a great workout to wear weighted gloves for an extra kick.

The only real negative to this DVD besides the mediocre intensity is that Denise's cueing is horrible.  She mostly tries to cue as she goes (which I don't like...I need them to cue ahead) but a lot of times she's on to the next move before saying anything.  Even her back up exercisers stumble a bit several times.  But, since the moves are simple for the most part I didn't have too much trouble my first time through the DVD.  And successive sessions were pretty much stumble free.

I would definitely recommend this to people who are trying to get into shape or for people who want a light cardio session for ""off"" days.",1201132800,97,2014,4.340482573726542
2988639,5,B000WOSAUG,"I love this workout video! I own 16 Denise Austin workout video's now and I love them all. They never get old because I rotate them daily. The cardio blast segments are great and I can really feel it the next day, which tells me this it's working.",1200614400,3,247,4.166666666666667
3222863,2,B000WOSAUG,I was not impressed with this.  I love Denise Austin's workouts but this one I was wishing the whole time it was over. I don't know it wasn't as fun and energetic as her other ones.,1200614400,2,181,4.027777777777778
3222864,4,B000WOSAUG,"For some reason, I thought that this DVD contained four complete cardio workouts, so I was disappointed to find out that it only contained four 10 minute segments (in addition to the warm-up and cool-down, which are each about 5 minutes).  As for the workouts themselves, each segment is a mix of high and low impact, but I work out a lot and mostly do higher impact cardio, so I found this to be more on the low-impact side (for me).  With the first two segments that I did (kick box and athletic intervals), I barely broke a sweat.  The retro aerobics segment starts out on the slow side, but for the last five minutes it's almost all high impact.

I haven't gotten into Denise's DVDs in the past because I found her bubbly personality to be a bit much for me, but on this DVD, she is pretty toned down, as other reviewers have said.  She's still enthusiastic, but not annoying.  And as other reviewers have noted, her cueing is pretty bad (she tells you what she's going to do next as she already has started to do it), but the moves are not so complex that you can't get the hang of them once you do the workouts a few times.  The variety of the workouts is nice as well - if you set it up as a complete 30-40 minute workout, it doesn't really get boring because you switch between different types of workouts.",1200355200,2,1314,4.295546558704453
3222865,5,B000WOSAUG,I really like Denise & don't find her to be annoying.  Her cueing is always off but after you do a workout a few times you know the routine anyways so by then it doesnt matter.  I really love this DVD.  If you do all 4 of the 10 mins workouts  you keep changing what you are doing & don't get tired of the same type moves.  I agree w/a previous reviewer that  it is nice that this one is purely cardio and no weights.,1200096000,,417,3.847058823529412
3222866,5,B000WOSAUG,"I really like her videos and I have been WAITING for a dvd like this from her. I have been repeating her dvds to get an hour out of them and that is difficult and I never got all I could out of my home workouts as a result...not to mention a pain....but it seems that workout dvds are common in they are short...but this one is different. You can add up to four workouts in any order and have them just start over if you want to. Now this is what I am talking about. This will cut my time by a bit and keep my heart rate up!!

If you like Denise's routines but wish they were longer...try this video out! You can even turn the voice off and have only music...I like my own music but it is a matter of preference.",1200009600,,712,3.910344827586207
3222867,5,B000WOSAUG,"I bought this DVD yesterday and I was so excited to try it out.  Denise Austin really toned it down for this one!  She was still smiley and motivating, but she wasn't over the top.  I really like that the workout is broken down into 10 minute segments because it had enough variety to keep me interesed. She's not the most convincing kick boxer, but she pulled it off.  The dance section was MUCH better than her Cardio Dance & Sculpt DVD.  I was sweating by the end of it.  I really like that this DVD is purely cardio and doesn't have weights section.

There are a couple things that other people might not like.  For the high impact moves she would give you a modification for lower impact but no one actually did it (at least that I saw, but I might be wrong on that.)The modifications were really similar to what she was doing or a previous step as she increased the intensity, so she didn't leave people completely in the dark. Her cuing was better, but especially in the beginning she cued as she was doing the move so it was a little hard to follow.  The next time I do the DVD it won't be a problem though.

All in all it was a good, fun workout with lots of variety.",1199404800,21,1176,4.1866666666666665

3222906,4,B000WOSAUG,"I do this routine on Prime video, more than my other videos. The routines are simple and easy to follow, and she makes it fun! She motivates you in a positive way. The sets are broken up into interval sessions, so you get little breaks. Each one is only like 8-10 minutes long, so they go quick and easy to swallow vs a whole 60 minute session, so if you get the DVD you can choose which one to do. Some are more intense than others. For example, there's a dance set that's entirely low-impact, last one is stretch out. I didn't want to do a Zumba or hip hop thing, because frankly those are crazy and annoying to me. This is not that, it gets you moving and I usually modify the routine based on how intense I would like. I can't get mad at her, even though she's Malibu barbie and so cute - because she makes it cheerful and says she's proud of you, you're burning fat. Do what you can, and not like pressuring you. It may be crap because I haven't done anything all week and ate ice cream last night, but I can't help but feel good anyway!",1409270400,,1042,4.112745098039215

3222908,1,B000WOSAUG,I am surprised that so many people thought this video was easy to follow and good for beginners.  I could not keep up with this workout simply because she changed the moves too quickly and didn't give any countdown to the next move.  I prefer the Leslie Sansone and Jillian Michaels workouts.  I also found Denise Austin's voice to be way too soothing and gentle for during a workout.,1408406400,,384,4.536231884057971

3222922,5,B000WOSAUG,I love Denise Austin after trying her workouts on my Prime instant video set up and now exercise to three of  her dvds plus Mary Helen Bowers ballet workouts also on prime. Denise is fun and I love fun! I had heard negative things about her being over the top peppy so stayed away but then had an injury from doing insanity so by accident thought I would try Denise and I am now hooked as I am working out and having fun and not killing myself. I do not know why people get so upset at people who are happy and upbeat and it is a sad reflection on todays society that people like Denise and myself are criticized and ridiculed by all the mean and unhappy people. By nature I am bubbly and happy and my life is good and Denise adds to that happiness and sets a good example. Maybe if more people danced with Denise there would be less meanness in the world and the cranky would leave us happy people alone. I cannot believe the reviews that really demean her instead of saying hat its not my cup of tea they have to trash her. I highly recommend this and remember that it takes time to learn any routine and when you went to college you didn't walk out of class because you didn't remember everything the first time.

3222967,2,B000WOSAUG,"I am in average shape, im a normal person that can do almost any workout video: with that said,here's my review...
PROS
She has good energy and encourages you as if she was with you. But that has more to do with whether you like Denise Austin, which I do. I just don't like this video.
CONS
Choreography wasn't good, some of the moves were either weird or hard to do
Assumes you know dance terms like ""box step"", it would've been helpful if she  showed us how to do it first
The retro aerobics, and cardio dance were my least favorite parts of the video. She rushes to much through the moves.

The funny thing is I noticed how this is the first time I ever saw an asian girl in an exercise video. Why is that? Did it take all these years to show some diversity in exercise videos?? Its about time! I thought that was good.
I like how she picks a variety of people to be in her workouts.",1394150400,,886,4.115606936416185

3222979,2,B000WOSAUG,"Jillian Michaels used to drive me nuts - I found her brash and annoying.  However, I recently put my money where my mouth was & started using some of her DVDs and found out that she's an amazing trainer & motivator.
I tried adding this Denise Austin cardio workout to my workout rotation, but it drove me crazy.  Denise Austin just doesn't motivate me - she has a breathy voice and chatters on ""you can do it"" over and over without any real directions or focus on form.  I found that I really need that hard core voice & motivation that Jillian Michaels provides...Denise Austin was uninspiring to me.",1394150400,,601,4.495412844036697
3222980,1,B000WOSAUG,Gave this a try after working out to Jillian for two months.  Denise Austin's personality will make you want to run from the room screaming.  She also probably had too much caffeine before shooting this video because she is going so fast that not even the dancers can keep up.  My heart rate did not come up at all during this workout and I hardly broke a sweat.  It is also too fast to get any kind of form down and she doesn't tell you what is coming up so by the time you figure out what she is doing she's on to a new move and you're behind again.  I will definitely be sticking to Jillian after this one!,1394064000,3,609,4.041666666666667

3222982,4,B000WOSAUG,"pros:

-I love a lot of her videos and her episodes from Fit TV in the 90's.  Her genuine enthusiasm, good explanations, and encouragement are excellent as always
- good reminders throughout about good form, how to take a 'moving break', etc.  She's a pro, it shows.
- really helps motivate me that she's in great shape in a natural way, which is my goal. She really shows the results of healthy eating and lifestyle.
- fun moves, once you figure out what's coming next.
- fun workout, was fun to do and mixed in new and older moves for variety!!

cons:
-I'm in good shape, yet it's a killer workout without warning you first.  expectations should be set better in the intro
- would prefer less constant changes to the moves.  I'd rather concentrate on good form than wondering about the next move.",1393804800,,798,4.506944444444445

3222984,3,B000WOSAUG,"This workout can get our heart rate up, especially for beginner to intermediate.  The way she jumps through different moves keeps the interest up, but is a bit frustrating if you are new to aerobics.  I will say her cuing is horrible.  A good aerobics instructor will cue up the next move in the 2-4 counts before the next move...not right as you need to do the move.

3222985,5,B000WOSAUG,"I can see where other people might find it too easy if they are really fit which I'm not.  But as a friend told me once who does P90X, you can make any exercise program more challenging on your own.  That said, I like Denise -- I tried her out after my dismal failure w/Jillian Michaels. Yeah, Denise is too much sunshine sometimes but I think it's genuine (or she's a good actress).  I can overlook that for Jillian Michaels' poor attempt at humor, bullying faade, etc.",1393632000,,470,4.379310344827586
3222986,5,B000WOSAUG,"I used to swim for 1.5 hours almost every day, run, lift weights, bike, and then I had twins.  Kids, life, work, etc really took over after that.  Now, 9 years later I am back to try exercising again at age 45.  I am not very out of shape, I still walk the dog, go hiking with the kids but have not taken time out just for ME to exercise.  I have been doing this cardio-blast program for the last week every day.  First starting with 2 workouts and moving up to all 4.  They are fun and keep me interested and engaged.  The moves are easy enough that a lot of talk is unnecessary to keep up.  I dislike doing exercises/routines where one needs a MFA in dance to understand what is going on.  ""Keep it simple and fun"" is my motto, and that is what this video does.  My knees are bad so I don't bounce or jump but keep my heart rate up by doing marches or something low impact while the cross country skiing is going on.  I look forward to doing this routine and even catch myself doing a few of the exercises throughout my day as the spirit moves me.  Denise is great in this video and it is motivating to know that she was around 50 when this video came out.  Gives me hope that I will get my waistline back!

UPDATE: 4/30/14  After 2-3 weeks of doing this entire workout 4-5 times a week my clothes were fitting more loosely, especially around the waist and thighs.  A little over 1 month after starting my 'muffin tops' (ugh!) had almost disappeared.  The scale indicates I have lost 3 lbs, but I think I have added muscle and shed fat.  My body does look more lean and toned.  I find Denise amusing, goofy and I enjoy spending time with her.  I have added 1 lb weighted boxing gloves to the kick boxing workout, which makes that segment more challenging.  I have tried other workouts, but find myself going back to this one time and again.",1393459200,2,1842,4.1908831908831905

I like that the workouts are 10-15 minutes and then on to something else so you won't get bored. But the moves are very basic and Denise seems a little ""off"" in this video. Like she threw this together real fast just to get a DVD out. I sweated a little....",1391040000,,408,4.243589743589744
3223005,5,B000WOSAUG,"This is a fun workout with a lot of variety. The segments are warm up, kickboxing (pretty low intensity for kickboxing), sports interval training (some volleyball moves, bit of tire drill, and the bow & arrow bit I always think of as 'the Katniss"", yeah i'm a dork), retro aerobics (fun!), dance (with a bit of latin inspiration), cool down.

I'd say its a low/medium-intensity workout. If you are just beginning this is a good place to start. Also good to rotate it in with other workouts which are a bit more difficult, but repetitive (I like Turbo Jam the best).  If you are already doing Turbo Fire or P90x or something like that, this will be like a walk in the park in comparison.",1391040000,,686,4.48
3223006,4,B000WOSAUG,"I really enjoyed this workout! This video is comprised of a warm up, a cool down and four 10-minute workout segments.

I appreciated the amount of variety Denise Austin incorporates. The 10-minute segments cover low impact kickboxing, sports drills, old school aerobics (think Richard Simmons) and aerobic dance. By breaking things up, the workout stays fun and time seems to pass quickly.

Some reviewers mentioned cueing issues. Although Austin's cueing does leave something to be desired, I don't think this presents a real issue until the final aerobic dance segment. Austin's cueing goes downhill here and she wears dark pants which make it difficult to discern what each move should look like!

The terms of intensity, I would say that this video provides a low to moderately challenging aerobic workout. I'm 8 months pregnant and still able to complete this video with only minor modifications. Once baby arrives, I'll likely keep this workout in my queue for days when I desire a lower impact, cardio driven workout.

Enjoy!",1390953600,,1032,5.125

I would recommend this dvd to anyone who is just starting out, or who wants to get that New Years resolution in gear. The work outs on this dvd are easy, and you can set the pace of what you want to do, and how much. Also the price was great for a Denise Austin dvd so win/win.",1390435200,,646,3.7573529411764706

Denise's outfit keeps changing. LOL. You can't help but smile when you work out with Denise. She's like, ""Come on! This is fun, enjoy yourself! do the best that YOU can.""

3223033,2,B000WOSAUG,"This workout is one reason why I stopped using workout videos so many years ago.  I don't disagree that these moves will get your heart rate up; they definitely do.  But Denise insists that you do each exercise at such a ridiculously fast pace that it's impossible to keep proper form to any of them.  Not that she seems to care about form - she gives zero instruction in that area, making this workout an injury (or five) waiting to happen.  The kickboxing and ""athletics""-inspired moves on the surface seem ideal, but they only resemble the actual moves in name.  If you've ever participated in any of the actual activities, you'll recognize the difference (partly because she Denise asks you to do them so friggin FAST).  You feel like you're just flinging your arms and legs around without any precision and without really targeting any of your muscles.  You'd get the same kind of workout from just dancing with like a five-year-old.
Adding to the frustration is the fact that Denise has music going in the background, but she doesn't seem to be listening to it while she's running through the routines - the exercises are constantly off-rhythm, making it really frustrating to the exerciser who doesn't know whether to follow the pace of the music or the pace of the people on screen.",1375401600,,1290,4.732142857142857

My 5 year old wanted to workout with me, so I let her and the first words out of her mouth were, ""Mom, why is this lady talking like that?"" Yes, Denise, in her chipper way, is a bit too chipper, but a lot of people like that, but I am one to like a more direct/tougher approach when it comes to the instructor.  I like a bit more of a challenge in a workout too, so for me, this wasn't a great matchup, but would be a great video for someone just starting their weight loss journey.  I did sweat a bit though, so I know some calories were burned, so maybe if I need to feel loved during my workout sometime, I'll turn it back on ;)",1366502400,,761,3.9607843137254903
3223053,3,B000WOSAUG,"As a caveat; I am not a fitness expert or instructor. I'm a middle age male trying to improve burn some fat & improve my conditioning while traveling (I don't like running).

I can't speak for women, but this is not a great video for men.  (It appears, in retrospect, to have been targeted to women; all the people in the video are women & there are quite a few feminine moves, such as the ""curtsy."")

Certainly, there are men who can move their hips & enjoy dancing.  I'm not one of them.  If you can move like Ricky Martin, more power to you, feel free to dance along.  If dancing makes you feel a little awkward, then I'd recommend trying one of her boot camp videos.

I would categorize this as mild-moderate intensity. It is quite a bit less intense than Denise Austin's Boot Camp, & way, way less intense than P90x,etc.  I think the title of Burn Fat Fast Cardio Blast is a little deceptive.  The intensity level is roughly on par with a fast paced walk.  Any exercise is much better than none at all, but I wouldn't expect the fat to ""burn fast"" with this routine.

While it lacks intensity, it requires a moderate (or better) amount of aerobic exercise type coordination.  A lot of the moves took me some time to catch on - I would typically start to get it down just as it was moving on to the next set.  Other reviewers have pointed out the cues are usually given AFTER the new move has begun, leaving first time viewers, such as myself, in a constant state of trying to catch up.

I would NOT recommend this if you are:
1) Hoping for an intense P90x or Insanity style workout
2) Experiencing serious joint issues (it's moderate impact)
4) Desiring a slow/gradual workout. This one isn't real fast, but requires some coordination & timing (more than p90x, for example).
5) Addicted to pushups & situps (there are none)
6) Wanting to bulk up (the heaviest thing you lift is yourself (when doing squats/knee bends)).

I would recommend this to women (or dancing men) who exercise occasionally but aren't in great shape, who would like a mild workout or who are interested in stepping up to the next level of aerobic video moves. You need to be quite mobile & coordinated.

Its true what they say, your metabolism slows down after age 30, especially for me since I'm not an outdoor enthusiast. Recently I decided to buy a few exercise dvds to help me lose the weight, and decided to look for Denise Austin since I remember doing her vhs tapes when I was a teenager. I am glad I did because I've already lost 5lbs in the first 2 weeks. At first the cardio blast was hard to keep up with because I'm not very coordinated, but each time I do it, I catch on to the moves a little better.

3223076,5,B000WOSAUG,"I almost bypassed this workout completely based on some of the reviews, but I'm glad I didn't!  I did this streaming, but I think it would make a great DVD to own.  I like the way she offers 4 different 10(ish) minute segments that you could mix and match so the video doesn't become boring.  You never have to do 30+ minutes of the same thing.  Yes, she does do the moves quickly, but remember, this is not a class--the faster pace is so that when you go back and redo the DVD you don't get bored with the constant slowed-down explanations of each move.  It may be slightly frustrating the first go round, but as long as you keep moving, it doesn't really matter if you do the moves perfectly, you'll still get a workout.

Others commented that this was low-key, or not meant for anyone in shape.  I don't agree--I've been a fitness buff for years (and even taught classes for a bit in college), so I'm quite fit, but I still got a great workout.  Not every workout has to make you feel miserable to be effective!  This is meant to be fat-burning cardio, and it will definitely get your heart-rate in that zone, especially if you do the moves full out like Denise does.  At the same time, it is still approachable for a beginner, especially since you can choose to do shorter segments.  Overall, I thought that it was a great basic cardio workout for all levels, and is fun enough that you will actually WANT to do it.",1357776000,2,1419,4.337121212121212

I already do strength training on my own twice a week, so I can really appreciate that this DVD is purely cardio because that is hard to find! Once I knew the moves I could make the workout harder on my own.  I can pick between 4 workouts as singles, or do them all together. I really get my heart rate up in intervals and I can really feel this in my core and hips the next day!  Awesome.  And honestly Denise's gentle sweetness is nice in the morning b/c I am NOT a morning person.  It puts me in a great mood, after a great sweat!

Thank you for sending me the DVD of Denise Austin.
Unfortunatelly, I was not be able to use it, as it has only an American Reading Code and not an European One.
I kindly ask you to send me an European Code or to let me know how can I get one.

Awaiting for your answer,

3223088,5,B000WOSAUG,I just want you to know this is an easy work out and fun fun fun it allows you to pick your work out how you want it and how long you spend on it. I think this is very easy to use for anyone I personally use it with my 12 year old son. My favorite is the kick boxing as well as the dance. I am by no means a health nut or in awesome physical shape. this is good for those who are starting bck up exercise. so I LOVE IT.,1296345600,2,419,3.4680851063829787

I love that you have four choices, you can do only one section or all four if you feel like it.  The kickboxing is a great workout and I totally love the Cardio Dance.  I could Mambo all night if it keeps burning off the calories!  I'll buy more of her DVD's in the future!",1295827200,,431,4.023529411764706

I love Denise Austin and have used her video's in the past to lose weight and get toned.

I love the different options (kickboxing, dance, retro aerobics, etc.) that this video offers and it really gets my heart beating.  At first, it may seem hard to follow but does get easier with each use.  I also like the fact that you can customize your work-outs so that you never get bored.",1291852800,2,395,4.614285714285714
3223092,4,B000WOSAUG,"This is a good fitness video to have in your collection.  The biggest plus is that the DVD includes 4 different workouts- each of them is 10 minutes long.  This allows you to pick and choose and customize your workout. You can do all 4 or you can do one of them 4 times, or if you're pressed for time, just do 2 of the workouts. Also, the workouts are varied, which I enjoyed. The kickboxing and retroaerobics got my heart rate up the most. The athletic intervals was interesting, but there was too much stop and go to get my heart rate into that fat-burning zone. The cardio dance was fun, but not intense enough if fat burn and weight loss are your goals. Of course, if you're a beginner, the workout doesn't have to be that intense to get results. Overall, I recommend this video to anyone interested in being fit.",1288051200,,817,4.333333333333333

3223094,3,B000WOSAUG,"When I bought this DVD, I had read a couple of reviews that said it was an easy to learn video and not confusing like her aerobic dance.  I like her Pilates video, so I thought I would give this one a shot for some cardio exercise.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT for those who are uncoordinated.  She never lets you know what she is doing ahead of time ,and then she does it quickly and doesn't show you how to do it.  She also strings together whole routines of these moves and doesn't give any forewaring.  I will not be using this video anymore; I'm going back to my Leslie Sansone walking videos! Kudos to the coordinated out there, but for those who are not so coordinated, stay away from this video.",1285977600,3,697,4.2105263157894735

In the last year, I have been on a journey to lose a significant amount of weight, so I figured I would try this to switch up my workouts.  The sound quality was awful, adding to the frustration I felt trying to keep up the cues that were too quick (in my opinion)",1264550400,3,386,4.133333333333334

I really wasn't into the girlie stuff but tried Denise because I wanted to do something different with my muscles.  I thought she would be too easy after working out with Billy but I was WRONG!!!  She wears me out.  And I love the way she divides her workouts into 10 or 20 minutes.  It seems to make the workout go faster because I don't get bored.  I will most certainly continue to order her DVD's.,1257897600,3,480,4.096774193548387

3223100,4,B000WOSAUG,"Overall, this is a very well-done DVD. What I really like is that you can create your workout routine before you start the video, you move from one workout to the next without stopping.  I like it a lot, I definitely recommend it...

3223101,4,B000WOSAUG,"Denise has been around for ages and so when I was looking for cardio dvd's for my collection I went ahead and added this one.  I switch out my dvd's so I don't get bored and my body doesn't get used to the workouts.
The dvd's has soem variety for the different dance styles which is nice.  I agree with another viewer that the cueing is totally off.  It took a couple times of using the dvd to know where I was going when.  The moves are easy and the pace a bit slower than I would have imagined.  You really have to put yourself into the workout to get what you need from it.  I liked Denises attitude in the dvd.  She is toned down but still perky.  I need perky sometimes, especially in the morning when I'm try to get the bootie moving.  I was somewhat unimpressed with the studio setup and the backup being out of synch.  It seems to be a lower budget set, but it gets the job done.",1246838400,,887,4.045977011494253

Normally I like something that i can pop in, it will give me a decent cardio workout and at the end I feel as if I've accomplished something. If you feel the same, then this is not the video for you. There is no intructional portion to familiarize yourself with the moves before hand, you have to figure it out as you go. By the time I watch to see what foot they're starting on, the full body movement, and get the hang of that move, she's onto the next step, where again, I have to figure out what she's doing. I spend more time watching the video than actually moving. Definately not something you can just jump into and have fun. If all her videos are put together this way, I will definately not be buying another one",1244678400,3,759,4.170068027210885
3223104,3,B000WOSAUG,"I bought this because I needed to do some cardio exercise. This seemed like a good DVD because of the variety and the fact that each segment is only 10 minutes. I like that you can mix and match which segments you want to do, and I admit it gets my heart pumping. But the cues are difficult to follow because Denise jumps into another move without any warning. I feel like I'm not getting the full effect of the workout because I'm concentrating on trying to follow her moves. Also, her routines are only ok. I really enjoy the kickboxing one but the other ones have some weird moves that I have trouble following (especially Cardio Dance).",1242604800,4,640,4.432203389830509

Debbie Siebers Slim in 6 ""Cardio Express"" is way better and only 30 minutes! Dont buy the whole set just that 1 is everything you need to see results.

It is truly hilarious watching her back-ups aerobizers try and keep up with her crazy moves.  It almost appears as if she makes all these moves up as she goes along(like she did on her tv program). When she does cue, it is wrong. Denise is better at pilates and simple toning. Her Personal Training dvd and Hit the Spot Pilates are her two best dvds. Stay away from this one, you won't like it.",1230336000,9,539,4.233009708737864

The option to choose the order, and what segments you want to play is fantastic, it makes it easy to workout a little or a lot without having to stop your workout. Denise really tones it down in this one, she isn't as scarily perky as in previous DVDs that she has done. This really is a great fun workout! Enjoy!",1222214400,,485,4.282608695652174

3223111,2,B000WOSAUG,"This was my first Denise Austin video and WOW was I disappointed!  Being new to Denise Austin, I found her a very annoying instructor (her voice sounds like she is trying to be sexy).  Her cueing was terrible (even the other girls behind her made numerous mistakes) and the choreography was a mess.  Her counts were never the same.  I bought this video because after reading many reviews I thought Denise was a great instructor and could really take my body to the next level.  That will not happen with this video.  The first time I viewed it, I tried all four 10  minute sections and I knew this will not be a DVD I use a lot.  The first two sections were pretty good and I worked up a little sweat, then I did the second two sections.  Don't waste your time.  Why do instructors think Mambo's, Grapevines and any other baby step movement will give you a good cardio workout?  The last two sections were a big waste of time.  The good thing about the way this DVD works is you may customize it to play whatever 10  minute interval you want.  So now I play the Kickboxing section twice and the Cardio Interval twice to give me a decent 50 minute workout.  If you want a great Interval Heart Pumping workout try Jillian Michaels.  She makes you feel like you have a personal trainer in your home.",1215129600,,1296,4.3375
3223112,5,B000WOSAUG,"This is a great, fun workout. It will make you sweat and it will give you great results. Denise is fun as always. I know alot of people say that she drives them nuts, but I personaly think she is very good at what she does. This DVD  lets you interchange 4 different workouts. It has a 5 minute warm up and a 5 minute cool down. All the workouts are fun and very easy to learn. I usually do the warm up, 2 workouts then the cool down. Nothing better than staying in my own home and not having to go to a stinky gym and workout!!!!",1213056000,2,530,3.9074074074074074

3223114,5,B000WOSAUG,"This is a good workout for burning fat. Although I have to admit its not for beginers. Denise is not very efficient when it comes to queing, as a result the movements change just when you're getting used to it. However each segment is designed to workout on different muscle groups, plus its good for the heart. I would recommend this dvd for intermediate level.",1210118400,,362,4.584615384615384
3223115,4,B000WOSAUG,"This is the first time I buy a Denise Austin DVD and I am not dissapointed at all. I read tons of reviews before deciding to purchase but I am glad I ignored the personal comments about Denise; I actually like her. I believe she is a genuine and upbeat person. I love the kick boxing routine, it makes you pump your heart up... (and works your abs nicely!)If you are really out of shape you may find this one difficult but you can keep it up until you can master the moves; it really worth it! I was not very thrilled about the retro-aerobics dance routine and the latin moves since they require a lot more coordination than the first two routines. I still do these for a change, it just a matter of personal preference; it works out your entire body, no question! The music is not the best but works for the routines. Also it has the option of turning off Denise's instruction so you can only hear the music (I've read lots of people dislike her voice!). I truly recommend this DVD, I do these routines 4 times a week and the rest of the week I do ""Hit the Spot"" -Core and Abs-, also from Denise Austin.",1210032000,,1104,4.212264150943396

You have to do it cause you will enjoy every bit of it.",1208217600,,347,4.2727272727272725
3223117,3,B000WOSAUG,"This isn't a bad workout, really, but there are some things you should be aware of when considering whether or not to buy it.  The biggest problem for me was all of the jumping around.  It would be fine in a gym, but I live in an upstairs apartment and just can't make that much of a ruckus.  So if you have the space and can take the high-impact, no problem.  However, if you have bad knees or live upstairs, this workout is almost certainly not for you.

My other problem with this dvd was that the workouts were so diverse in nature, I just couldn't get into a rhythm with them.  It would be wonderful for someone limited on time who just wants to do a section here and there when they can squeeze it in - it would make for great variety.  However, if you're looking to do a longer workout in one segment, I found it very difficult to ""switch gears"" from one workout to the next.

This COULD be a good workout depending on your needs.  For me, it ended up on ebay.",1207094400,16,967,4.128342245989304
3223127,3,B000WOSAUG,"I thought that this was not a great exercise video.  I did like the Kickboxing portion, but that was it.  Everything else seemed too fast, she sped through everything, and kind of looked disorganized.  I love Denise and have about 10 of her DVD's, but this was a disappointment and a flop. I tried it for the first time, and it was my last time.",1206748800,,345,4.276923076923077
3223128,4,B000WOSAUG,"This is one of those exercise programs that let you pick and choose the length of your workout.  It consists of 4 diffrent 10 minute workouts (Kickboxing, Cardio Dance, Athletic Interval and Retro Aerobics) as well as a 5 minute warm-up and 5 minute cool-down.  As a high intermediate to advanced home exerciser, I find this DVD to be a lot of fun and quite effective as a workout.(I do the entire 50 minutes). True, it is not the HARDEST exercise routine out there, but it is still challenging. It packs a lot of variety, you NEVER stop moving and you will sweat and burn quite a bit of calories! I really like the music in this one, and it's great that the DVD comes with a music-only option.  Denise is not the best cuer, so initially there will be some confusion, but within a few repetitions, you will not need her to tell you what comes next. All in all, a fun and upbeat exercise routine! Good job Denise Austin. :-)",1205971200,2,923,4.354651162790698

This video is fun.  It's not that hard though, good for beginners or intermediates wanting an easier day.  The cueing is bad; I'm not sure if it gets better later in the workout or if I just got used to it.  Overall, it is fun.",1202688000,,399,4.116883116883117
3223130,3,B000WOSAUG,I would not recommend this to anyone who is just starting out. Not that it is that difficult it isn't - Denise's calls are so far off - she is just about to the next move when she calls the one she is almost done with. Or so it seems. It is a shame this is a nice work out - the 10 segmants keeps the pace and does not get boring. If you do this a few times and get a feel for what Denise is going to do next - you will end up with a very nice workout that can work you into a sweat if you bump the moves up a tad.,1202515200,,514,3.439655172413793
3223131,5,B000WOSAUG,Denise is not kidding - it is a sizzler.  She combines moves from previous workouts with lots of new action as well.  A great workout. Great job Denise!,1202428800,2,152,4.392857142857143
3223132,4,B000WOSAUG,Denise Austin has never been one of my favorite instructions.  Too peppy & poor cueing (she calls late!).  But pure cardio dvd's seem hard to find so I gave this one a try and wasn't disappointed.  I am an advanced to intermediate exerciser and find that if I just modify some of the moves during the workout I can get my heartrate where it needs to be.  I especially enjoyed the retro section the moves reminded me of Denise's early days with some Jane Fonda and Kathy Smith thrown in.  I think if you give this dvd a chance you will get results with doing it.,1202342400,,561,4.254716981132075
3223133,2,B000WOSAUG,"I'm not usually a huge Denise Austin fan (something about her voice and ""perkiness"" just doesn't work well for me especially in the mornings!) but I do have a couple of her other videos, so I decided to give this one a try.  Unfortunately, I should have saved my money.  What I did like about the DVD was that you could mix and match your workout routine before you started the video so you could move from one workout to the next without stopping.  You can choose from a short warm up (10 mins. or less) 4 different 10 min. or so workouts, and a quick cool down (again, 10 mins. or less.)  At the beginning of each workout, she does a ""mini"" warm up, which I think is redundant since there's already a warm up at the beginning of the video and it only serves to allow your heart rate to drop back down (if it got up in the first place.)  The kickboxing routine is a series of kicks and punches, good for someone who has never kickboxed before but not difficult at all.  The ""athletic interval"" training is not true aerobic intervals.  Instead, she teaches various moves that mimic movements from other sports.  The retro 80s workout will not have any of your favorite 80s songs, but it does have moves that are reminiscent of the leotard and legwarmers era.  Lastly, the dance section does have some ""dancy"" moves that you should catch on to easily after just a couple times doing them.  All in all, the variety is good, and it's very easy to follow, but I did not feel like I got a great workout.  My heartrate did not elevate very much at all, and I barely broke a sweat (of course working out in a freezing cold basement in the winter helps that!)  If you are a beginner exerciser who gets bored easily, this is a good video for you.  If you've been exercising for a while and you're looking for a challenge, try something else.",1201651200,25,1832,4.321637426900585
3223134,5,B000WOSAUG,"After having some health issues in 2007, I tried to get back to exercising with advanced dvds right away.  I was becoming very frustrated and a friend suggested I try some Denise Austin to get back in the swing of things.  I used to love Denise but had advanced beyond her workouts.  This dvd is perfect and I am so glad I tried it!  I can do all the segments or just one, depending on how I feel.  Denise's cueing leaves a bit to be desired, but if you like Denise you can look past that because this is really a lot of fun.  She is lower key in this dvd than in some others but still friendly and motivating.  Her personality and enthusiam is just what I needed at this time.  I enjoy all the segments but am partial to the retro aerobics section...I love it!",1201219200,25,761,4.129251700680272
3223135,4,B000WOSAUG,"Denise Austin usually drives me nuts.  I can't handle the whole perky aerobics instructor thing.  However, I took the plunge because I was drawn to the different styles of cardio offered on this DVD and because a lot of reviewers said Denise really toned it down in this one.  Turns out, Denise really DID tone it down.  She's friendly, low-key, and very pleasant in this.  The different cardio sections are very fun, especially the Retro aerobics.  I don't know why I got such a kick out of this one, but it just flowed smoothly with fun moves.  The kickboxing was good, though a little fast moving if you've never done these moves before.  In the interval section, there is a lot of jumping in the last few minutes so make sure to wear a good sports bra!  I couldn't get through the dance cardio, honestly.  But that's no fault of Denise and I knew when I bought the DVD that I probably wouldn't like it.  Dancey cardio is not my thing; I'm too clumsy.  But, since the DVD is chaptered so beautifully, I don't have to do it!

As far as intensity goes, don't expect an over the top sweat fest.  You get out what you put into it, of course, but I wouldn't recommend this to people who are in good shape.  You'll probably be bored.  I'm not in great shape, but not just starting out either and I got up a decent sweat.  It would be a great workout to wear weighted gloves for an extra kick.

The only real negative to this DVD besides the mediocre intensity is that Denise's cueing is horrible.  She mostly tries to cue as she goes (which I don't like...I need them to cue ahead) but a lot of times she's on to the next move before saying anything.  Even her back up exercisers stumble a bit several times.  But, since the moves are simple for the most part I didn't have too much trouble my first time through the DVD.  And successive sessions were pretty much stumble free.

I would definitely recommend this to people who are trying to get into shape or for people who want a light cardio session for ""off"" days.",1201132800,97,2014,4.340482573726542

8224502,4,B000WOSAUG,"What I liked:  The breakdown of the four workouts into sections that you can mix and match or do all of them in a row. As a advanced exerciser (I have over 50 DVDs in  my library ranging from Insanity to Amy Dixon Breathless Body to Turbo fire), this isn't the most difficult/challenging workout out there.  That being said, I was pleasantly surprised that I did work up a good sweat after the warm up and three of the routines. I liked the kickboxing the best, as Denise throws in some different choreography from other kickboxing instructors.  I like Denise.  She's very motivating.
What I could do without:  I didn't care for the last routine (Cardio Dance).  I think it was just too easy for me, so I did the first three and then did another Denise workout (Quick Burn Interval) for the remainder of the time.  The music is lame IMO, as it is in her other workouts that I own, but I still enjoyed this workout and will keep it in the rotation for days when I'm not up to the Insanity or Amy Dixon Breathless Body workouts!",1501545600,,1026,4.363157894736842
