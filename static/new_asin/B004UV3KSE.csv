4471099,1,B004UV3KSE,"First Universal took three years to release the 8 seasons of Magnum P.I.  Each season box set was different from the other.  The first few seasons were printed on double sided flipper discs which were very deffective.  Now they are releasing a best of on standard definition dvds.  Please Universal I beg you give the fans of this wonderful and iconic show the box set that they and the show deserve.  A remastered COMPLETE SERIES single sided blu-ray box set with extras including crossover episodes, cast interviews, and pop culture trivia about the show.  We would gladly pay big money for quality product.  Don't rip us off again.",1306886400,17,634,4.814814814814815

4471104,5,B004UV3KSE,I love the whole Magnum P.I. series.  I watched it in the 80's and enjoy it now.,1405900800,,80,3.7058823529411766
4471105,4,B004UV3KSE,"These few episodes give a good representation of how fun this series was (still is).  They do tend toward the dramatic with more emphasis on Magnum's Viet Nam past than the series had as a whole.  The first two-part episode is there, setting the tone, and the final two-part episode is there, as is the great Limbo episode.  I do wish they had included my favorite ""Forty"", but I can't complain too much.  Overall this is a great sampling of one of the few great TV shows from the 80s.",1402358400,,485,4.355555555555555

4471110,5,B004UV3KSE,"Take me back to the 80's! good drama! Love the car! Magnum delivers some great performances and it still is safe to have the kids watch shows like these.
If you are looking for all around good entertainment, this is it!",1364860800,2,219,4.365853658536586
4471111,3,B004UV3KSE,"I bought this because one of the Magnum websites said that this had the original broadcast version of the final episode.  It doesn't.  It's exactly like the one on the Season 8 set.  Same ending credits, same cut scenes, same syndicated, 2 part version.  The good part is that it only cost $3.",1358467200,2,293,4.471698113207547
4471112,4,B004UV3KSE,"As a teenager in the 80s, watching Selleck in short shorts wasn't appointment TV. But for classic TV from the era, MPI can't be denied. Picked the set up for $3.99 and it's perfect for me.",1345334400,,188,4.25
4471113,5,B004UV3KSE,"These are simply the greatest TV movies I enjoy watching.
The stories seem to draw you into being part of the show.
I enjoy Tom Selleck as an actor.",1340755200,,148,4.137931034482759
4471114,5,B004UV3KSE,I recieved this as a Christmas present and love it! The first DVD has the first episode which was great because I don't think I ever saw that one.,1326326400,,146,4.068965517241379
4471115,3,B004UV3KSE,"Does anyone know if the episode ""Resolutions"" is the syndicated version or the original broadcast version of the episode?  Any help is appreciated.",1322697600,,147,5.391304347826087
4471116,4,B004UV3KSE,"While I agree with the other reviewers I must say I don't mind having alternate version of the first 2 - two hour episodes. The shorter versions were created for syndicated runs and sometimes in addition to being shorter, the sequence of scenes is jumbled around to fit the time allowed for the episode to air, and in some cases, it makes more sense. I would like to see more of these special sets with the alternate versions but would have included or would like to see included, the 1 hour version of the crossover story arc for Murder She Wrote and Magnum P.I. The first part was called Novel Connection and in the syndicated run, it was cut so that the entire story was solved in a single hour. The single version is not available on DVD and is a rare find on Ebay as a VHS title (I do have it though) The 3rd season of Magnum has the single hour version of another crossover from Simon and Simon, called Ki'is Don't Lie or something close, the crossover episodes of both Simon and Simon and Magnum are included as an extra on season 1 set so it doesn't make any sense that the single hour version of Novel Connection wasn't included in season 7 unless its available as an easter egg....Now I will have to go and look. I hope there are more of these, with the alternate versions as they are still fun to watch and sometimes guess what scenes are cut and/or rearranged.  I think Universal should do the same for Buck Rogers so that we can actually own the pilot for Buck Rogers and not the crappy movie version that was 8 minutes shorter than the pilot. Even if its presented in the future in its 2 part form, that would still be better than not having it at all. I have recorded it off of RTV but the quality is sub-par and since it was aired over the digital stations it has the square box all around it, even on my old 4:3 TV and its tacky.",1309910400,3,1846,4.229461756373937
4471117,3,B004UV3KSE,"I don't think anyone mentioned it (or noticed it) but Don't Eat The Snow In Hawaii is a shorter version of the same episodes from Season One.  The Best of Magnum cut out the part when the sister of the dead naval officer arrives at Honolulu airport drunk.  I believe they have cut out a few minutes of each episode.  Beware.  As a true Magnum fan I need everything, however, as an alternative I do like the compilation and think it's a good idea.  Just wish they include the full versions though.",1309910400,10,496,4.3478260869565215
4471118,1,B004UV3KSE,"i own the entire series and wonder why people would want to buy selected episodes of a series. seasons 2 to 4 were released on flippers and we all know the problems with those discs. i also wonder how this could be the best of when ""all for one,"" a two parter from the fifth season is not included. in that two parter magnum and his buddies go back to Nam in search of pow's.",1308787200,3,375,4.013333333333334
4471119,3,B004UV3KSE,"This 2 DVD release is called ""The Best of the 80s: Magnum P.I.""

Here are the episodes:

Please Don't Eat the Snow in Hawaii - This is the two hour pilot. As an introduction to the series, it serves its purpose well. But I've never considered it to be one of the series' best episodes.

Memories Are Forever - This two hour episode from season 2 is a wonderful, emotionally intense story. That being said, it's not one of my personal favorite episodes.

Home from the Sea - This is my favorite episode of the series. This is the one where Magnum treads water for almost the entire episode. It's from season 4.

Blind Justice - What in the world is this season 5 episode doing here? It's not a bad episode, but there's no way I'd have put it on a best-of.

Kona Winds - This is from season 6. No episode from season 6 is good enough to be on a best of compilation. Has anyone who bought season 6 ever watched the entire season a second time?

Limbo - This is the last episode from season 7, and was originally planned to be the last episode of the series. I certainly won't complain about this beautiful, touching episode being here. However, please be warned that this episode has a major cliffhanger ending, which is not resolved in the contents of this best-of.

Resolutions - This two hour episode from season 8 is what actually ended up being the end of the series. It's inferior to Limbo, and I would not have included it.

My advice if you're looking for an introduction to the series? Skip this compilation, and get season 2, which is my favorite season. Or, if you really don't want to be without the wonderful ""Home From The Sea,"" then season 4 wouldn't be a bad place to start. Or, if you're especially fond of the two hour episode ""Did You See The Sunrise?"" then season 3 could be a good place to start. Any one of those seasons is better than this compilation.

If I was going to make a 10 episode compilation of my own personal favorites, I think it would be these:

No Need to Know (season 1)
J. ""Digger"" Doyle (season 1)
The Woman on the Beach (season 2)
Mad Buck Gibson (season 2)
The Jororo Kill (season 2)
Texas Lightning (season 2)
Black on White (season 3)
The Arrow That Is Not Aimed (season 3)
Faith and Begorrah (season 3)
Home from the Sea (season 4)

Each of these 10 episodes is a fantastic story which stands perfectly well on its own - with no cliffhanger endings or complicated multi-episode storylines - because episodes that do have those things really need to be seen in the total context of their respective seasons, and not on a compilation. So while I very much enjoy episodes such as ""Mac's Back"" (from season 5) and ""Unfinished Business"" (from season 8), I would not include them on a compilation.

Other may disagree with me. Some might say that a true best-of would have to include all of the major plot points regarding Mac, Michelle, Lily, etc. And that is a good argument.

I guess, in the long run, the only ""best of"" that really matters is the one you carry inside your own head.",1308096000,30,3023,4.375
