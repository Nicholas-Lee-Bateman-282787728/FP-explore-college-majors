8182436,5,B000NYAKVM,"I just got into the motorcycle races and AMA Superbike is the best next to the motogp.  I wanted to find out about the rider and catch up with the AMA for the 2007 season. This is the dvd to do it!

It's got all the 2006 action with Mat Mladin and Ben Spies at the helm. Very well done as far as the review goes...they interview the riders about each race and show the footage. So it really keep your attention thoughout the dvd.

Plus, there's extra's with Ben spies, interview with his girlfriend, and Migel and his fiance as well.

A great review to keep you up to date with what is going on in the AMA Superbike world.  And now it's all about the 2007 season with 11 throttle twisting races to go!!!!!",1176595200,2,705,4.154411764705882
