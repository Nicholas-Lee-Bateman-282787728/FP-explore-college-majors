7730170,5,B01E4687AU,"*I received a review copy of this collection in exchange for an honest review

I continue to be impressed with the titles Arrow and MVD are releasing in these Blu-ray sets.  Although I consider myself somewhat well-versed in film, I have to admit I had never heard of the FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION series prior to receiving the release notice.  Needless to say, I was intrigued.  Revenge flicks usually rate pretty high with me, so I was eager to see how good these vintage gems might be.

Im very happy to report Arrow and MVD have scored yet another major hit with this collection.  If you are any kind of fan of grindhouse films or if you simply like female-revenge-flicks, then this is the collection for you.  Crammed full of special features and clad in beautifully rendered packaging, this Limited Edition set is a must-have for film fans and collectors alike.

This collection has an astounding number of Special Features, which are listed at the end of my review, and they are a real treat for those who enjoy such things.  There is an obvious absence of behind-the-scenes footage, but that is probably due to the fact that none exists; these films are so old Im sure none of it was preserved.  But the SF we do get are cool nonetheless.

Each film in the FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION collection is shot well and looks good overall onscreen.  Ive read critiques online that claim the HD transfers are subpar for the Blu-rays, however I have never seen previous versions of any of these films and cannot, therefore, attest to any other quality.  I personally think the transfers look pretty good; there are several grainy scenes interspersed throughout the series, however Im sure this is due to the quality of the original film negatives.

The acting is excellent, with Meiko Kaji portraying the titular role in each movie.  I find Kaji to be a stellar actress, and I regret I have not seen her in anything else that I can recall.  The supporting cast in each film does a good job as well, however I cannot single out a particular performance that shines.

The special effects in the films are well done and look good.  In addition to the blood, we get some decent carnage as well.  One particular gruesome scene that threatened to haunt me shows a naked man with a bloody tree stump rammed into where his genitals should be.  I cringed when I saw this, and I doubt the image will leave my mind anytime soon.

The stories are all separate, however they relate to each other as a continuation of the plotline.  Surprisingly, they do not get old, and they really don't repeat each other.  I was expecting to see a rehash of the previous film as I continued to watch the series, however that didn't happen.  Instead, I found myself continuously engaged as the storyline unfolded.

The FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION complete set is a big win for me, and its another tally-mark on a big list of excellent releases from Arrow Video and MVD Distribution.  I highly recommend this collection, and I cant wait to see what obscure classics they come up with next.  The FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION is available now.",1474502400,,3100,4.661141804788214
7730171,5,B01E4687AU,"Despite some justified criticism towards the quality of the transfers, it does appear that publisher Arrow Video did the best they could with the original prints provided by Toei, and it is my opinion that in the end this is the best presentation available for the Meiko Kaji Sasori movies.
The initial trilogy directed by Shunya Ito (""Female Prisoner 701: Scorpion"", ""Jailhouse 41"", ""Beast Stable"") is among the best pieces of entertainment that came out in the 1970's... worldwide. Surely, these are all exploitation movies, but filmed with unusually superior craftsmanship and inventiveness (we all have to thank Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" movies for bringing these Meiko Kaji works out of obscurity). The fourth entry directed by Yasuharu Hasebe (""Grudge Song"") is vastly inferior to its predecessors, but I gladly accept its inclusion here for completeness' sake.
Of the various extras, the best parts are archival interviews with directors Ito and Hasebe, and the packaging is also worthy of praise.
Which leaves me with my only complaint about this release: the dreadful artwork that fails to capture the essence of these films and is, to put it bluntly, just ugly. Thankfully there are reversible covers with the original Japanese Posters for each individual Blu-ray sleeve, but there is nothing that can be done with the outer box.",1473120000,9,1345,5.202764976958525
7730172,4,B01E4687AU,"Women-in-Prison movies occupy a particularly seedy corner of the exploitation universe, seemingly serving no other purpose than to titillate, torture and shock.  From perverse Nazi prison camps to sweaty Filipino cages, the settings may change but the ingredients are largely the same:  rape, beatings, showers and lesbian sex.  Even for cult film aficionados, WIP movies are a hard genre to justify let alone openly enjoy.  But the Female Prisoner Scorpion series is one of the genre's rare stabs at respectability.

Based on a popular manga, the first film - Female Prisoner #701: Scorpion - introduces Nami Matsushima (Meiko Kaji) who winds up behind bars after being seduced and double-crossed by her lover, a dirty cop with Yakuza ties.  Vowing revenge, Nami suffers through the worst punishments the sadistic guards can dish out while her reputation and fame make her a target for other prisoners.  She avoids one attack in the shower (blinding the warden in one eye in the process), scalds another rival with hot soup and seduces a female cop sent in to gather information.  All without speaking a single line of dialogue.

Directed by Shunya Ito, the film doesn't shy away from all the expected nudity and violence, but it does work them into the plot with a little more finesse.  And Ito's visual exclamation points - including waves of colored gels, theatrical sets and manga-inspired action sequences - elevate the material.  As does the casting of Meiko Kaji, whose cold eyes framed by twin waterfalls of black hair make her wordless anti-heroic performance almost as legendary as Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name.

Female Prisoner Scorpion:  Jailhouse 41, the first sequel, is arguably the best of the series, and certainly the most visually creative.  Opening with a long series of dissolves as Nami sharpens a spoon into a shiv with nothing but her teeth, the film hits the road with nine other inmates on a prison break.  While the inmates attempt to avoid re-capture, they suffer even more injustice at the hands of the outside world, including a tour group gone horribly wrong.

Here the theme of evil, abuse and deception suffered by women at the hands Men shifts into overdrive, kicked off by the tragic and catchy theme song.  Emboldened by the first film's success, Ito lets loose a colorful barrage of experimental set-ups that dig into the minds of its female characters.  Yet in the end, it all falls upon Nami restore order and balance between the species, finally settling the score with the one-eyed warden and avenging her comrades.

Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable finds Nami on the run after hacking off the arm of a detective to escape a pair of handcuffs.  His pursuit eventually leads him to a prostitution ring where Nami has befriended a young hooker pregnant with her brain-damaged brother's baby (pretty out there even for a WIP movie).  Spotted by an ex-con with a grudge, Nami attempts to avoid them both but winds up cornered in the sewers as the authorities close in.

Beast Stable spends the least amount of time inside prison walls of any film in the series.  But it's generally a positive change, with Nami's struggle to survive in the new landscape breaking up the monotony that was beginning to set in.  It also introduces an impressive costume change, draping Nami in a floppy fedora and black coat like an avenging vision of death...and features the most satisfying double-whammy finale to date!

A change in the director's chair (Yasuharu Hasebe) gives the final entry - Female Prisoner Scorpion: #701's Grudge Song - a bit of a different feel.  Split into to distinct halves, the first focuses on Nami's relationship with a crippled ex-revolutionary, Kudo, who earns her trust.  But when they accidently kill the pregnant wife of a police officer, Kudo's information leads to Nami's arrest and transfer to death row.  Meanwhile, the now widowed cop wants to prolong Nami's punishment, hoping for a more personal revenge than the hanging planned by the State.

Grudge Song is the most conventionally plotted film in the group with an episodic feel not so far removed from a weekly TV show (one with plenty of boobs and blood...so more like HBO).  And as surprising as it is to see a human side to Nami's character, it erases some of her mystique and comic book invulnerability.  By this point, the Scorpion films were just running low on ideas.  And for a series with such a nihilistic worldview, going out with a whimper seems somehow appropriate.

No bones about it, Arrow Video's Female Scorpion: The Complete Collection is going to garner a lot of attention, especially as the Blu-ray set is limited to 3000 copies.  But not all of the attention will be good.  There's already much debate about the transfers themselves, which differ from those used in the past, removing some color tinting in flashback sequences and emphasizing a different color palate in others.  There's also a large amount of grain washing over every film, sometimes to the point of distraction.

If this is a big issue for buyers (and for many it will be), I recommend checkout out some screencaps.  Arrow has explained most of the changes and these are new 2K restorations...so the problem must lie in the source prints used.  But for those with no previous copies under the belt The Complete Collection will be a godsend, gathering all four films and an obscene amount of extras in one gorgeous package highlighted by a pair of visual essays from Tom Mes that break down the series' evolution and modern influence.",1471737600,8,5551,4.908896034297964
7730173,4,B01E4687AU,"Based solely on the wonderful lunacy of the storytelling and film-making technique in these movies, I would give this box set five stars.  However, I have to knock off one star for video quality that is really problematic in places.  It never really rises to the level of a typical blu-ray restoration, and in some places it is sub-DVD quality.  Having said that, fans of Japanese film, Quentin Tarantino (especially Kill Bill, Vol. 1 &2), and inspired weirdness should look no further than this box set.",1471564800,4,504,4.837209302325581

8757588,4,B01E4687AU,"These movies are a blast to watch. Meiko Kaji is perfect in the role of the Scorpion.  Honestly, the first movie is good, the second one is better (and rather weird), and the last two are not so good.  They're still fun, though.  I've heard some people complain about misogyny in these movies.  They couldn't be more wrong.  The woman is the hero here, people, and not the only heroic woman!  There is a great deal of misandry, however.  Nearly every male character is a villain: drug dealers, dirty cops, rapists, sadistic jail guards and wardens, etc.  Men are depicted as being very evil.  How is that misogynist?  In these movies, it's okay, though.  They had a point to make about the sexism of the time and they made it.  There's almost a surrealistic feel to these movies, as if these stories are taking place in an alternate version of Japan.  It's just hard to believe that all of these things could take place in the real world.  They get pretty outrageous.",1522972800,,967,4.546511627906977
8757589,5,B01E4687AU,"I decided to get the Arrow Female Prisoner Scorpion The Complete Collection since it was loaded with extras. These include:brand new 2K restorations of all four films in the series presented on High Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD, original mono audio (uncompressed PCM on the Blu-rays) for all films, optional English subtitles for all films, double-sided fold out poster of two original artworks, reversible sleeves for all films featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Ian MacEwan, and a booklet featuring an extract from Unchained Melody: The Films of Meiko Kaji, an upcoming book on the star by critic and author Tom Mes, an archive interview with Meiko Kaji, and a brand new interview with Toru Shinohara, creator of the original Female Prisoner Scorpion manga. I had previously seen the first film, Female Prisoner 710: Scorpion, but I think I was distracted by the misogyny and violence and missed homage to Siejun Suzuki in the see through floor and other artistic elements that were pointed out in the extras which included:a newly filmed appreciation by filmmaker Gareth Evans (The Raid), an archive interview with director Shunya Ito, a new interview with assistant director Yutaka Kohira, and Theatrical Trailers for all films in the series.

Perhaps, Shuyna Ito's second film in the Female Prisoner Scorpion series, Female Prisoner Scorpion: Jailhouse 41 (1972) is more impressive visually and more satisfying plot-wise than the first film. In this installment After spending a year in solitary confinement, Matsu (Meiko Kajji) escapes from prison with six other convicts. In turn they are hunted by the guards led by the vengeful warden who wants her dead at all costs. There are several kabuki or traditional Japanese cultural set pieces throughout the film such as the traditional singing of the old lady in the abandoned village that explain each of the escapee's crimes. The start of that scene has the house being pulled apart that is similar to a scene in the hijacked bus that becomes detached as well. This dismantling of the house calls to mind a similar scene from Shohei Imamura's documentary/drama A Man Vanishes. Kaji is all about her steely stare-very much like Leone's Man with NO Name played by Clint Eastwood-I think Kaji has only one line reading in the film. The Arrow version includes: newly filmed appreciation by critic Kier-La Janisse, commentary from Japanese cinema critic Jasper Sharp who looks over the career of Shunya Ito, a new interview with production designer Tadayuki Kuwana, and the Original Theatrical Trailer.

Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable (1973) is the last collaboration between director Shyuna Ito and his team in the series with Meiko Kaji but it is not the last chapter in the series-a fourth film was made. This one has some ghoulish elements and take place in the seedier areas of Tokyo as well as the sewers of the city as Scorpion wrecks revenge as an escaped convict. I liked the 70s cabaret scenes and seedy reality of Tokyo as it was shown in the film. Kaji shines again in a mostly voiceless performance of the avenging angel of sorts-who will go to great lengths to get her freedom and greater lengths to get revenge. The Arrow extras include:a newly filmed appreciation by critic Kat Ellinger, an archive interview with director Shunya Ito, a new visual essay on the career of star and icon Meiko Kaji by critic Tom Mes, and Original Theatrical Trailer.

I have to say I'm a little sad that I've finished the Female Prisoner Scorpion series after seeing the last installment, Female Prisoner Scorpion: #701's Grudge Song (1973) directed by Yasaharu Hasebe this time. Even though they have created a special comic book universe-this one also gives glimpses of the seedier side of Tokyo in the 70s in which Matsu (Mieko Kaji) escapes into a strip club and is helped by a former student protester . He helps because he has also been tortured by the cops and hold's his own grudge. The cops track her down by getting her unfortunate new lover to confess on her location-she will have another score to settle once she has finished with the cops. This film doesn't has as much visual flair but enough to recreate Scorpion's word especially at the penultimate scene as well as in the strip club. I have enjoyed the informative extras a lot: newly filmed appreciation by filmmaker Kazuyoshi Kumakiri (Kichiku: Banquet of the Beasts), archive interview with director Yasuharu Hasebe, Japanese cinema critic Jasper Sharp looks over the career of Yasuharu Hasebe, a visual essay on the Scorpion series by critic Tom Mes, and Original Theatrical Trailer.",1520380800,,4655,5.019404915912031

8757591,2,B01E4687AU,"I dragged my feet before buying this set based on all the negative reviews about the transfers. But I thought, ""they can't be THAT bad. Arrow is a good company and amazon reviewers can sometimes be a bit dramatic and hyperbolic"". Well, if you already own these films on dvd, there's no reason to buy this set. In an effort to make these old films look hi def, it seems they simply turned the contrast way up. Yes this makes it look brighter but the lighter colors look washed out and there's tons of grain (which the previous dvds don't have) and there's even this strobe effect going on quite a bit throughout. You know when you see a computer monitor on film and they didn't correct it in post production you see these white horizontal bars of fuzziness going up and down the screen? Well, there's a little bit of that going on here. It's shocking how bad it is. Very sad. The first three of these films are fantastic (the third BEAST STABLE is my favorite Japanese film of all time) and they deserved better than this. To amazon's credit, my case was damaged and they refunded me as soon as they saw I'd shipped the box back to them. I didn't watch the extras. I don't care about them so much. I just love the films. I wish they'd put the care and love into the transfers and they put into the design of this set. The artwork is well done and they put some obvious care into the booklet.",1503360000,9,1390,4.2889733840304185
8757592,4,B01E4687AU,"Ill say this over and over again and hope that some get the point. One of the joys of movies on disc is the opportunity to view movies from other countries in the best format possible. Some played at art houses over the years, some at grindhouses and some straight to video here in the US. This rediscovery of some amazing movies by companies trying to restore them to the praise they deserve has led to a boon for movie fans.

Among these is the FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION series of films that came from Japan. Along the lines of the low budget women in prison films made on the cheap for US companies, the series is based on a comic of the same name. The success of the first film led to three more in the series and helped the status of star Meiko Kaji after having starred in the Stray Cat Rock series of films. The tale of a woman wrongfully imprisoned seeking revenge in a world of uncaring men carried on through all four films.

In the first, FEMALE PRISONER 701: SCORPION we are told the story of Nami Matsushima (Kaji), a young woman set up by her crooked policeman boyfriend in order to win favor with the local yakuza. Raped and abandoned she tries to kill her boyfriend only to be caught and sentenced to hard time in prison. There she is treated poorly by the guards, raped once more. Fights with other prisoners also take place but she eventually escapes with revenge in mind.

The second film is FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION: JAILHOUSE 41. It opens with Nami in prison, solitary confinement no less, where she is being tortured by the guards and the warden, Goda. During an inspection she is brought out with the rest of the prisoners, attacks Goda and is once more returned to solitary while the rest of the prisoners are sent to a labor camp. He then instructs his guards to rape Nami before sending her to join the rest. She and several other prisoners escape and avoid capture. Each has a chance to tell their story before they police move in to capture them. As they are either captured or killed, a final confrontation between Nami and Goda is set in motion.

Third in the series is FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION: BEAST STABLE. On the run from the end of the last film, Nami takes refuge with a prostitute in a brothel. The lady in charge of the brothel learns who she is as well as discovering she is the ex-lover of the policeman who killed her lover, a member of the yakuza. She lets them know and an eventual battle between the Scorpion and the yakuza who have framed her for a crime is bound to happen.

Last in the series of films is FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION: 701S GRUDGE SONG. Captured by the police, Nami escapes to find a hiding spot with Kudo, a young man who works in a sex show club. Kudo has a history of problems with the police and that won't help later. One of the women who works in the club and was trying to seduce him and jealous of Nami turns Kudo in to the police. They eventually let him go and follow him in hopes of catching Nami.

As you can tell from the descriptions the movies here were not high art. And yet there are some amazingly graceful shots and sequences in these films. The story of the woman done wrong in a world where men are all users of women is one that resonates with some. The production values are high for movies made on the cheap. The acting, even when viewed through the haze of subtitles, is well done by all.

Arrow Video has released this box set and done an amazing job. Not only are we presented with the most gorgeous looking editions of these films the extras are astounding. Included are: a double-sided fold out poster of two original artworks; reversible sleeves for all films featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Ian MacEwan; a booklet featuring an extract from Unchained Melody: The Films of Meiko Kaji, an upcoming book on the star by critic and author Tom Mes, an archive interview with Meiko Kaji, and a brand new interview with Toru Shinohara, creator of the original Female Prisoner Scorpion; newly filmed appreciation by filmmaker Gareth Evans (The Raid); an archive interview with director Shunya Ito; a new interview with assistant director Yutaka Kohira; the theatrical trailers for all films in the series; a newly filmed appreciation by critic Kier-La Janisse; Japanese cinema critic Jasper Sharp looks over the career of Shunya Ito; a new interview with production designer Tadayuki Kuwana;
a newly filmed appreciation by critic Kat Ellinger; an archive interview with director Shunya Ito; a new visual essay on the career of star and icon Meiko Kaji by critic Tom Mes; a newly filmed appreciation by filmmaker Kazuyoshi Kumakiri (Kichiku: Banquet of the Beasts); an archive interview with director Yasuharu Hasebe; Japanese cinema critic Jasper Sharp looks over the career of Yasuharu Hasebe;
and a visual essay on the Scorpion series by critic Tom Mes.

This box set was limited to just 3,000 so fans will want to make sure they pick one up before they're gone. The extras aside the movies are well worth watching and display a style and genre that few have seen before. It is well worth seeking out to enjoy.",1502323200,,5112,4.561002178649238
