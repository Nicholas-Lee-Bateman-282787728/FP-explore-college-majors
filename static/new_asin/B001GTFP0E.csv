8306972,4,B001GTFP0E,"This is a simple, fun anime that you can't really find fault with. In fact if you like this you may be able to take a step up to the crazier ones that have been put out like Pani Poni Dash, Azumanga Daioh, or the countless others that I or others can recommend but I digress. The main character here is fun to watch, her sidekick (you'll see) makes her even more so and the others reactions to them both are fun to watch too, especially when they realize who they're yelling at. The plot is pretty basic with typical storylines (SPOILER ALERT) like I lied to my mom so please act like I'm the one in charge, ect, ect, ( END SPOILER)  and a slight mystery is added to it that ties the whole story together but it's not so deep that you'll be shocked or put off by it. That being said this is not by any means the best school comedy out there but it is still good enough that you'll want to see the end. So though there are better shows out there if you can find it and have time to kill, new to anime, or have younger kids to mid teens (14 tops I'd guess) it's fun to watch.",1383436800,,1073,3.9906976744186045
8306973,5,B001GTFP0E,"The product I received was absolutely perfect. Brand new, still in the packaging.  I got my product in a decent amount of time and am very thrilled to have it.",1336608000,,159,4.3
8306974,5,B001GTFP0E,"I doubt an over-40 male is part of the target demographic for this show but that doesn't keep me from enjoying it. I found it by accident when it was offered for free viewing on Netflix. What I expected to be a fairly boring show was very engaging, funny and cute. I also liked the Powerpuff Girls and for some reason this reminds me of that show, the sly humor and over-the-top action appeal to me in both shows.

I'm not yet through the whole collection but I've decided to buy it so that when it's no longer on for free I'll still be able to watch it again. It's amusing to see what Rino's puppet will do next, he's pretty much the only continuing 'male' character thus far and he seems to get the funniest lines. The idea of a show about a student council with an assault and espionage squad is so odd that I know such a show would never get greenlighted in the US so I'm glad someone somewhere has original ideas and boldness to carry this off. If you liked the Powerpuff Girls or similar shows, give this one a try and you might enjoy it as much as I do.",1249257600,5,1060,4.145631067961165

8306976,5,B001GTFP0E,"My wife and I watch a lot of anime. We love the greats like bebop or FMA, rahxephon etc. But its nice to have more light hearted ones to break up the drama. That is what we used this anime for and its great for a light hearted fun show.",1238544000,2,236,3.74
