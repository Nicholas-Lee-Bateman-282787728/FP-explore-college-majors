8470517,5,B005FQH7A0,Really breaks it down to scientific unbiased level of viewing Cannabis. A+++,1526169600,,76,5.416666666666667
8470518,5,B005FQH7A0,"For those out there who still believe the science hasn't been done on Medical Cannabis, here is the truth!  This is the best information I've seen to date.  It's bipartisan, comprehensive, and understandable.  No more excuses!  Get yourself educated and then vote whenever you can to legalize this plant.  Cannabis is not a drug....it's an herb and a flower.  It's natural, it's organic, and it's been in use for millions of years by native tribes and cultures around the world.  Doctors, judges, courts, law enforcement, politicians, educators, and anyone who wants to help heal the sick and mentally tortured should watch this film.  Then act to make this natural wonder available to everyone in whatever form is right for their malady.",1504742400,,738,5.041322314049586

8470522,5,B005FQH7A0,"I've seen many documentaries  - as many as I could find, from the '70s to now - on this subject, and this particular film is a standout as far as a balanced, well supported, comprehensive take on this subject.  This video should be required viewing for law enforcement, politicians, the judiciary, and everyone else making money from this bizarre prohibition of a plant. It should be required viewing in high schools, colleges, churches - anyone who claims to care about human well being. Especially doctors. The science is in - you cannot hide behind that red herring any more.

Through this film you can understand the realities of both the plant's power to heal and the desperation of those who have no real alternative - having miraculously survived (many don't) the gauntlet of chemicals masquerading as medicine, these law abiding citizens are labeled criminals for the simple act of ingesting a life-giving plant put here by God, that is mentioned by name in the Bible.

If you want the truth about this demonized, maligned, miraculous plant, watching this documentary is a great start.",1390608000,3,1093,4.956284153005464
