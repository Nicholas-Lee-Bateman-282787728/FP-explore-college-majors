8457120,2,B0054TXEAA,"I found that Chris jumped from topic to topic without good flow.  He assumed we knew some things already (for example massaging the horse down in the cross ties) and did not always repeat a demonstration to ensure it was understood.  Would have preferred to see examples of multiple horses for each of the discussions, rather than single horses.  The framing was not great.  Could not see the placement of the whip at times.  Also, the demonstrations in the stall were not clear due to ""blind spots"".  Probably won't rent the rest of this set.",1402876800,,543,4.663157894736842

8457122,4,B0054TXEAA,Plenty of good information about horse behavior and techniques for effectively interacting with your horse in changing some of those behaviors. I like this guy's approach and philosophy.,1389225600,,186,5.678571428571429
