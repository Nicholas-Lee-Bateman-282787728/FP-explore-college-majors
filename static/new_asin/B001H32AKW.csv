8307752,5,B001H32AKW,"Snapshot of the dawn of electric cars. This documentary was made before the first Tesla was sold or the first Chevy Volt. There are nice interviews with Elon Musk and Bob Lutz. There's also a short drive in a prototype Tesla. At this point the Volt body was still a clay model, but the drivetrain was in some test vehicles. It's a nice bit of history, showing how skeptical the world was before Tesla proved itself.",1492473600,,415,4.473684210526316
