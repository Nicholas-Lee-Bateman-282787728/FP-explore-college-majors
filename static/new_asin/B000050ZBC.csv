7929175,5,B000050ZBC,"Mike Scudder is one of the greatest exhibition free throw shooters in basketball history. He can sink approximately 98% of his exhibition free throw shots. An astonishing fact is that Mike can present this shooting demonstration while giving a nonstop monologue while shooting. Apparently Mike's concentration is so focused that talking while shooting doesn't distract him. Mike's speech dwells on the motivation, philosophy and strategic psychological components of free throw shooting.
  Mike's shooting demonstration is highly motivational. I perform one-person basketball shooting demonstrational shows myself. Mike's advice has been very valuable to me.",1034467200,,658,6.064516129032258
