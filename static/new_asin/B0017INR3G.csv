8266128,1,B0017INR3G,"I bought this used and didn't pay much for it but will likely try to re-sell it on ebay.  I don't plan on keeping it.  It was a big disappointment.  There were scant few interviews with any big name hair/metal bands from the 80's.  Jani Lane did some interview footage, but since he's been kicked out of Warrant, the interview is sort of pointless.  I'm a huge Cinderella fan and the only one they interviewed was drummer Fred Coury who I love, but he had little actual talk time and there were no other interviews talking about Cinderella or any clips of their videos or songs.  There was not a lot of time spent on Poison either.  If they could have cut out all the x-rated clips of naked women dancing, there would have been more time to have put in footage of things that people would have actually wanted to have seen and heard.  It did seem very poor quality overall.  It was a waste of time to watch actually.  I'd give it no stars if I could.",1275264000,3,950,4.256983240223463
8266129,2,B0017INR3G,Be warned this dvd is not what u might think .... Although the box looks Awesome the contents are very different ....  This dvd looks to me to have been made with a camcorder and someone running around L.A filming whoever and what ever looks 80s hahah...  at one point the camera holds on a Girl .( and im thinkn who is she ? ) no context whats so ever ... Dont buy this if u have already seen A HEADBANGERS JOURNEY because u will be very disappointed... this will go into the back of the collection.,1219795200,3,500,4.144329896907217
