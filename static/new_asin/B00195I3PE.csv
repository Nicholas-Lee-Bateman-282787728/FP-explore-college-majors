It captures the struggle between cattlemen and farmers for the land.
Thank you.

3423521,4,B00195I3PE,"This 1958 film is based on much the same story line as was the beautiful Western Classic ""Shane"" but not nearly as well done or as structurally magnificent.  However, this movie does have some things going for it, not the least of which is the portrayal of men and how they deal with their feelings about each other; often cruel, always competitive, affection carefully controlled.  It is worth watching, and the opening song ""Saddle The Wind"" is romantic indeed, for us females, though I imagine male viewers will label it ""a chick flick serenade"".  At least the ones I know will!

Story:  Of two siblings, Robert Taylor (who is R.T. whether as a gunslinger or a Knight) stars as the older brother - mature, sensible after having cast aside his past;  glad to be still alive and with a lot of regrets.  He is determined to prevent his brother from making the same mistakes, and has built a ranch from the ground up in his quest for earned respectability.  Into this volatile mix comes Robert Taylor's little brother, all grown up physically but not mentally, who is not only irrational and dangerous, but downright goofy to boot.  Since he knows his older brother has been a hired gun in his younger years, his type of personality is ripe to think he can not only follow in Taylor's glamorous footsteps, he can be twice as fast, twice as dangerous and is anxious to provide the proof.  He brings a dance hall girl (Julie London) home after a wild weekend in town, and an explosive situation is exacerbated from all sides.  John Cassavetes has the most complex role, and he does a good job as the randy younger brother obsessed with making his mark as the upcoming kingpin of the valley, to be ruled by the gun and dominance.  During the ""street scene"", which was his best chance to bring the character home, his eyes glitter with insane malice.  Of course, there must be a love interest whether one is needed or not, and that falls to Julie London, who manages it because not too much acting ability is required for the role of the saloon girl ""looking for a home."" (but she definitely has a good voice and performs the title song)

It, like ""Shane"" and ""The Virginian"",  is a saga about homesteaders vs. ranchers; the last of the open range, the ""free grass"" without fence, plow or much population.  A comfortable alliance has been struck between Robert Taylor's character and the ""boss of the valley"", ably done by veteran actor Donald Crisp as another big land and cattle king who has more extensive holdings but sees Taylor as a strong backup support because he is growing old.  It is fortunate that this particular cattle baron is also a principled, honest man who wants to bring law and order to the valley in addition to keeping it free and open for stockmen.  Unfortunately, he is put in a position where he must take a stand; free range and the ""old ways"" against more bloodshed, intimidation and violence, and to a man like himself, the choice is clear if not entirely desirable.

It is a very good story line, but some of the writing is more shallow than it might have been with such a viable plot to work with, but that is found in many films of that era.  They were struggling to break out, and it shows in spots.  However, as an avid Western movie admirer, I am always looking for a good old one, one I haven't seen so it was easy to make allowances for that.  The photography is beautiful, set in a valley ringed with blue mountains and picturesque ranch layouts.",1329264000,2,3479,4.541666666666667
3423522,4,B00195I3PE,"John Sturges just re-shot a few scenes in the studio because MGM was afraid that Robert Taylor would look too old under the Colorado sun. A superb western, very modern, mostly thanks to the performance of John Cassavetes. Robert Parrish is definitely a director to rediscover. The ten first minutes, with only a supporting cast, sets the tone of the whole movie. Highly recommended.",1322697600,,382,4.984375
3423523,5,B00195I3PE,"This film has three plots: ranchers vs. farmers, brother against brother, and who gets the girl. Robert Taylor is an ex-gunfighter, who killed five men, who was befriended by a land owner, Deneen, worked for him for some years, and was given part of the land to raise cattle for himself. His raised his brother, who appears to be in his early twenties - the film does not say. The brother is somewhat immature. He was always interested in guns and killed animals as a youngster. He went to town for a couple of weeks and returned with a new gun and a woman he only knew for two days, and wants to marry her. She, a saloon singer, is not in love with him, but is tired of her job, and wants to live on the big Sinclair (Taylor and his brothers) ranch. She is attracted to his older brother, Taylor.

 A gunman arrives in town wanting to kill Taylor. Taylor's brother kills him, but only because the man was distracted.  He now thinks of himself as a fast gun. Then a farmer comes to the valley with papers showing that part of the Sinclair ranch belongs to him. He wants to fence his property in so that he can keep out the cattle and farm it. Taylor warns him to leave, but his brother threatens to kill the farmer. Deneen recognizes that the farmer has a legal right to the land and tells the farmer he will go with him to town to buy the fence wire.

 Taylor's brother kills the farmer and Deneeen tells the two bothers to get off the land and leave the valley. Taylor agrees, but his brother is now out of hand and wounds Deneen. What happens next? Is it at all possible for Taylor to save his brother, or is it too late? Can the relationship between Taylor and Deneen be salvaged and, if so, how? What happens to the farmer's family and his land? What happens to Taylor's land? What happens to the girl?",1300665600,,1807,4.256559766763848

3423526,3,B00195I3PE,"""Saddle the Wind"" is the first of two 1958 Westerns in which Taylor plays a reformed outlaw... He is cast opposite a promising newcomer John Cassavetes... The sexy and flamboyant Julie London provides the love interest but her role is poorly defined and almost working from outside the plot...

Robert Taylor is a personality on screen rather than an actor... He plays here an ex-gunfighter who has reformed and is living and working on his ranch peacefully... But fate will not allow him to retire... Cassavetes, his wild young unstable brother shows up carrying a six-gun, and with a sexy dance-hall singer London...

Cassavetes' intensity did add excitement to the show... He shoots down a tough character and with his killer instinct now waked up, he attacks a group of homesteaders led by Royal Dano and sets fire to their belongings... This battle has much more cinematic electricity than the final confrontation between the two brothers...

Strong landowner (Donald Crisp) imposes himself at this point, and asks the two brothers, now troublemakers, to leave the country...

Shortly after that time, Cassavetes gets into a wild and confused struggle with Crisp's men and is wounded, but manages to escape... Taylor goes out to get him...

With some magnificent Colorado Rockies scenery caught effectively by George Folsey's CinemaScope and Technicolor photography, ""Saddle the Wind"" is modestly effective, humorless Western drama...",1234224000,15,1439,5.293859649122807

3423536,4,B00195I3PE,"I liked this surprisingly deep and serious psychological and social drama disguised as a western. It certainly deserves to be better known than it is. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Steve Sinclair (Robert Taylor) is nowadays a farmer in a mountainous valley, but once he was a valiant soldier and a dangerous gunslinger. During the War Between States he fought for the Confederation and not just in any unit - he was one of the Quantrill Raiders, brave but quite pitiless secessionist guerrillas. The fact that he once rode with Quantrill tells us, that the action of the film takes place probably either in Missouri or in Kentucky (Arkansas is also a possibility). He rents his ranch from the main landowner and real power figure in the area, a certain Dennis Deneen (Donald Crisp), a man already aged but who still wears that crown...

His peaceful life is however frequently disrupted by various incidents caused by his emotionally unstable and gun loving younger brother Tony (John Cassavetes). Tony can do his job when he wants and the film begins when he comes back from the expedition to sell the cattle, bringing a lot of money, as he didn't lose many animals on the way and got for the herd a better price than expected. But he also brings an unexpected guest into the house - Joan Blake (Julie London), a stunningly beautiful saloon girl, who looks for a new start in life and is ready to try her chance even with an immature, (and by the way younger than her), unstable and ultimately not very bright guy like Tony. The same day arrive also to the valley a gunman from Steve's past and a group of farmers, former Union soldiers, who have a claim on part of Steve's land. And then the film really begins.

This is a surprisingly serious and dark movie, in which an almost oppressive feeling of approaching tragedy appears immediately in the first seconds. More than a western this is actually a psychological drama about a community which has to cope with the presence of a dangerous, irresponsible, childish, sociopath  who still is nevertheless precious to many of them Then there is also social drama, about a terrible conflict of interests between farmers and cattle herders, magnified by the fact that both groups fought earlier on opposite sides in War Between States And then thrown in the middle there is also a former saloon girl, who is ready to do almost anything to just feel clean again when she wakes up in the morning

Actors offered a great show here, beginning with Robert Taylor who is very convincing as a reformed killer, a very dangerous man who doesn't have anything to prove anymore and who was very much pacified by a life of hardships... John Cassavetes is AMAZING as immature, unpredictable, gun crazy Tony, who just was born too late to go to war and somehow is unable to live peacefully. Julie London has a smaller part, but she adds a lot to this film, especially in the wonderful scene when she sings to Tony the beautiful ""Saddle the wind"" song

The scenario is strong and the result of the unavoidable final confrontation is both immensely tragic and quite logical. All the tragedies shown in this film are somehow underlined by the incredible beauty of the mountains, with its fields of wild flowers covering the slopes and old trees keeping watch over deep valleys.

I liked this film a lot and I am glad that I bought and watched it. I will definitely keep the DVD for another viewing in the future. ENJOY!",1442188800,,3480,4.685761047463175

The range war is only background for the story of two brothers of much different temper and mind. But there are so many good things to watch. Robert Taylor is powerful, not much talking with great authority. Julie London is very convincing as the girl who realizes it is the wrong brother she lost her heart to and good old Donald Crisp who was in pictures since he filmed with Douglas Fairbanks in the early twenties is a master as an old, wise cattle king. But the film goes to young John Cassavetes as the restless, hysterical, gun eager, cowardly little brother to Taylor. We know he is a great actor but already so young he steals the picture. The final showdown is like the plot a little thin but all in all this film is highly recommendable.",1377043200,2,835,4.428571428571429

The acting style of Cassavetes was a bit too much for me. Maybe the director wanted so. He was really out of bounds. It was not realistic any more. Of course, this is a poor critique! We love traditional westerns, because they are not realistic. Julie London was beautiful, unrealistically so, if you look about her clothes. But it does not matter so much, when the story is O.K. Tragedy ended optimistically, which is always good. Goodness must win. There are better westerns, but one hopes that films like this could be still made.",1359676800,,700,4.563492063492063

3423569,5,B00195I3PE,"Saddle the Wind is the result of a creative conflict between golden era Hollywood and the cool method acting world of New York in the late 1950's.  Both the writer, Rod Serling (of Twilight Zone fame) and John Cassavetes represented the new, ""cool"" world of New York.  Robert Taylor, holder of the record for the longest employment by one studio) represented Hollywood with a capital ""H.""  The director, Robert Parrish, was more on the New York wavelength.

From what I've read, Cassavetes tried to antagonize Taylor with his difficult behavior and, when he failed, got even more outrageous.  The New York crew regarded Taylor as incredibly ""square.""

The result of all this is a fascinating conflict of styles.  Taylor prided himself on not ""mugging"" and here his reserved style worked well as Cassavetes' older brother, a retired gunman.  The pain of a man watching someone he brought up as son, not a younger brother, turn into an unstable, erratic killer is evident on Taylor's craggy face.  The younger brother is in constant motion--he seems to mistake activity for accomplishment.

Through a number of plot twists including disputed land ownership, romance (with Julie London) and brother-to-brother conflict, the film moves quickly and stylishly towards its inevitable end.  The photography is excellent, making the best of the glorious scenery.  Julie London is underused but does what she can.

In the end, New York and Hollywood work well together to make a highly watchable film.",1337644800,22,1491,5.1115702479338845
