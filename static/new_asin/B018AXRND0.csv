8741909,4,B018AXRND0,"Absolutely fantastic over the top gore fest. What a hidden gem!  Never heard of it before. Gritty, low quality video just makes it better. Great story line, great torture and murder. Great effects. Can't give it 5 stars cause of the color filtering at the beginning. But what a great movie!",1524787200,,290,4.686274509803922
