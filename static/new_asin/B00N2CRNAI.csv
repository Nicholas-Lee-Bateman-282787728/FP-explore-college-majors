6608056,5,B00N2CRNAI,"Finally, I get to see all those episodes I missed because my parents thought I was too young to watch them.  Very pleased with this collection and so far, all the discs played without incident.  I had forgotten about how Hitchcock did humorous intros and played up the role of the show sponsors.

6608065,5,B00N2CRNAI,"I grew up w/ these on TV. I forgot how much we enjoy the twist he gives to his endings. And, his dry humor at the opening of each episode. We, my husband and I, are really enjoying them. Hitchcock was a master of suspense and mystery.",1423353600,2,234,4.0

Five great seasons from the Master of Suspense, featuring stories by some of the more famous television writers of the day and starring actors and actresses who have become legends in the annals of pop culture. Bought at a great price, I had happy to pass my Season One that I already owned to one of my best friends.",1416441600,3,338,4.296875
6608070,5,B00N2CRNAI,"Good collection of the 30-minute Hitchcock TV series.  Not much bonus material, but that is not important to me.  Also, all the DVDs played without a problem, which I have found is not always true of box set offerings.  For that reason, I now test all the disks before the Amazon return window closes.",1416355200,8,301,4.537037037037037

8675798,5,B00N2CRNAI,"It is very good.  The picture quality is great.  The best part is that the commercials are removed of course, making it more enjoyable to see.  A bonus is that you can see a bunch of future stars in lead and cameo roles.",1523145600,,220,4.069767441860465

8675801,1,B00N2CRNAI,"I opened the box to look at the DVDs and choose one to start watching. I was horrified to discover that they look like there were used for a very aggressive, impromptu hockey game! Broken plastic, torn and battered boxes that hold the disks, etc. At this price, it really is a huge letdown. Buy at your own risk.",1506988800,2,312,4.305084745762712

8675804,1,B00N2CRNAI,product defect period! the discs have a backside i never knew about until i brought another set on ebay cheaper and that the computer showed me the combined front and back episodes and that the ones in the back some do not play and some make the computer freeze and crash the machine and you cant get the disc even back before it got to the episode that crashes... this happened to the wonder woman set the wanted dead or alive before they rebooted and fixed the problem. Im surprised no one else noticed or complained.,1495843200,,519,4.416666666666667
