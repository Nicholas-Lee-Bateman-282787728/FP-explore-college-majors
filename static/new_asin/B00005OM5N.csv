1641190,5,B00005OM5N,"This is one incredible DVD package of the Corrs at the top of their game. After seeing the Corrs VH1 Live in Dublin performance, I was expecting stripped down versions of the ""In Blue"" material. I was surprised at the full realization of the Mutt Lange touches on ""Give Me a Reason"", ""Radio"" and ""Breathless"" -- full of the full electronic whistles and bells present on that CD. Perhaps the most incredible part of the performance is when Caroline joins Andrea and Sharon up in front for ""Runaway"",""All the Love in the World"" and Thin Lizzy's ""Old Town."" The camera work is top-notch. Beautiful sweeping shots of the entire family and occasional split screen coverage during Sharon's brilliant violin solos. The staging is also dazzling in this large scale event. The ""Live from the Albert Hall"" DVD is perhaps a little more intimate performance, but this is a slice of the Corrs in the big league. Outstanding.",1021334400,11,911,4.808917197452229
1641191,5,B00005OM5N,"I watch the Corrs live in Manila concert here in the philippines and I was pretty excited when I bought this dvd,in here you can find all the latest songs perform live in a concert  bec unlike before you can only find those new songs in MTV video. I especially like when they perform the song ""give me a reason"",""breathless"",""dreams"",""radio"" and so much more,a must have for all those fans of the corrs.",1017187200,4,403,4.52054794520548
1641192,5,B00005OM5N,"Not to much to say about this DVD.  If you are a fan then buy it.  The DTS track is nice to finally have on a Corrs DVD.  Video quality is great and there is really nothing else you  could ask for, except maybe more DVD's available for us here in the States.",1017100800,3,258,3.811320754716981
1641193,5,B00005OM5N,"One of the best live shows I have ever seen on DVD.  The sisters and brother were fantastic.  The sound was crystal clear, it was like listening to a cd but being able to watch them live!  Their singing, and ability to play the various instruments so expertly made me appreciate just how talented the siblings truly are.  Just an awesome concert!",1397088000,,346,4.532258064516129
1641194,5,B00005OM5N,"This recording was clearly made at the height of the band's talents. The musicianship and professionalism of all members of the Corrs was outstanding and the song selection and order of presentation is sure to satisfy any viewer. As well, the incredible beauty of all three sisters only served to enhance the overall presentation.",1388188800,,330,5.12962962962963
1641195,4,B00005OM5N,This concert really showcases the talents of this hardworking family group. I really enjoy the tight vocal harmonies of their Irish based popular songs from this 2000 concert in London. The band members play multiple instruments and are always contributing to the sound in one way or another.,1367366400,,292,5.104166666666667
1641196,4,B00005OM5N,I love this dvd. The sound and video quality of this one is good. I felt this is a good buy.,1300060800,,92,3.4285714285714284
1641197,3,B00005OM5N,"I bought this after a friend sent me a clip of the Corrs performing somewhere. I loved the clip, and hoped to ""get to know"" the band better by getting this full-concert DVD.
Alas, the editing of the DVD video is the tired, way-overused format used for ""music videos"" on MTV. There were at least 5 or 6 cameras, and in the edited final product, no particular shot holds for more than about 3 or 4 seconds. As a result, this isn't a ""concert"", it's a long, long Music Video.
You're whiplashed back and forth between the back of the audience, super close-ups of various of the beautiful performers, close-ups of instruments, etc., with no chance at all to get any sense of intimacy or ""presence"". They also stir in a mess of extra video tricks such as shifting from color to black&white even during the same 3-second shot, going to slow-motion partway through a 4-second shot, and on and on.
The performers are beautiful, the musicianship is wonderful, the musical arrangements are upper-middle-of-the-road for the most part, the audio is great... but the video editing belongs to what some video editors call the ""Look at me!! I'm Editing"" school of MTV-influenced triteness.",1251676800,4,1173,4.783251231527093
1641198,4,B00005OM5N,"The lighting at the stadium was terrific. Songs were stage edited a bit which I don't really like it. And most of the songs in 'In Blue' were to pop for my taste. It doesn't sound too natural to me. The show could have done better with another approach. But it's already in the past, so there's no need to argue.

Nonetheless this is a successful for most of the fans. The sisters dressed pretty. This is their first DVD features DTS and multi-angle in a few songs.  There's a 360 view on 'so young' if you have a pc.",1202515200,,517,4.16
1641199,2,B00005OM5N,The sound is very low. It sound like being muffled. The lyrics are sentimental. The singers are attractive. I found most of the music sound the same.,1183680000,,149,4.555555555555555
1641200,5,B00005OM5N,It's a special DVD for our company. In any kind of event people feel nice with it.,1168473600,,82,3.8823529411764706
1641201,5,B00005OM5N,"The Corrs performance on this DVD is great, not as great as ""Live at Lansdowne Road"" and not as beautful as ""MTV Unplugged,"" but it is a great and it's definitely better than the new ""Live in Geneva.""

Any fan of The Corrs should have the ""Live in London"" DVD in their collection, and if you aren't a fan, it should make you a fan.  Of course that's provided you actually appreciate genuine music that has a melody as opposed to a lot of that ""noise"" that is marketed as music these days.  The Corrs put out real music because they are talented performers, musicians, and lyricists.",1143417600,,582,4.420560747663552
1641202,4,B00005OM5N,"Nice sound and very entertaining; although, their live performance is lacking in comparison to their remastered work.  Live, the voice and band quality just aren't up to par, and the music mixing quality is lacking as well.  The violin solo in excellent! I just love the creative video graphics!",1136678400,,295,5.0
1641203,5,B00005OM5N,"The thought that there are better Corrs concerts out there on DVD is certainly encouraging because ""The Corrs - Live in London"" (a.k.a. ""The Corrs at Christmas"") is pretty good.  There are some clips on the documentary of the Corrs performing at Lansdowne Road that makes it clear how this one is different.  Obviously the audience is not as big, even at Wembley Arena, but the stage is a lot bigger which means the group is spread out much more for this gig (I assume fans know how the Corrs line up on stage so those who want to be on the Sharon side or the Jim side or in the middle with Andrea and Carolyn can purchase tickets accordingly).  The other difference is that the digital photograph shows up great on my television set.

The 116-minute set includes songs from their third album, ""In Blue,"" and is directed by Hamish Hamilton, who would also do the group's Dublin concert in 2002 (he has also done multiple concert films for U2 and Robbie Williams).  There are some points where the director pointedly reminds you he is around, when the images turn to black and white or the close ups of Andrea Corrs became a bit too close, but for the most part you can just enjoy the concert.  Ultimately, you do not even have to really watch this one because just listening to it is pretty good, but special mention must be made that they make it real easy for you to sing along on this one because the subtitles are labeled ""Lyrics,"" and you have probably caught enough concert DVDs where that is not an option, so appreciate this one.

The group's most recognizable songs are here with ""Runaway,"" Breathless,"" and ""So Young,"" along with their covers of Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"" and Tin Lizzy's ""Old Town.""  But the tracks I kept replaying as soon as I heard them were when Andrea picks up her tin whistle and the Corrs go to town on the instrumental numbers ""Joy of Life"" and ""Paddy Cathy.""  After all, the sound of the Corrs is the blend of Irish music with contemporary pop-rock, and those two pieces represent the high energy points in the concert.  I have been to Irish fest in Milwaukee several times and once this type of infectious music gets into your blood you are pretty much hooked for life.  There is also an unplugged section where Carolyn gets out from behind her drum kit and joins her siblings down stage for several numbers.

When you get to the bonus features you can pick your favorite member to watch during the performances of ""Dreams,"" ""Radio,"" and ""Breathless"" (or watch each in turn).  It is interesting to watch how animated Sharon is while singing versus playing her violin, but I must admit watching Carolyn wail away on the drums is captivating.  There is a documentary that gets the group to sit down long enough to talk about their music and touring and a video of the group doing an unplugged version of John Lennon's ""Happy X-Mas (War is Over),"" which they give a simple elegance by virtual of their soft harmonies.  For me that last part is key, because ever since I started listening to the Smothers Brothers I have had a special fondness for sibling harmonies, and the Corrs certainly fit that bill.",1114128000,6,3137,4.556939501779359
1641204,5,B00005OM5N,"This DVD rocks! I'm a new fan of The Corrs and recently bought this DVD because I had heard the audio CDs before and really liked them. Everything is excellent, the image quality, the crispy DTS sound, the lights, the bonus material... not to mention the look of the three sisters (and women would say Jim looks good too).

The song selection is quite good, although I miss 'Erin Shore' and 'Love To Love You'. The black and white thing is discussable, but I think it is not that bad, I mean, not enough to give them less than five stars.",1108684800,,538,4.326732673267327
1641205,3,B00005OM5N,"If you're here shopping for a Corrs concert DVD, then you are already a fan and are probably trying to decide which one to get.  My recommendation would be Lansdowne Road as first choice, followed by Albert Hall, and this one (London) last.  All three DVD's have different advantages and disadvantages.  This one is the newest, so it has more features than the others and it has some of their newer material. BUT, the videography makes for a frustrating watching experience.  A big part of the beauty of the Corrs is that their music and their skill stand on their own.  The ""fancy"" camera work that the London dvd is very heavy on seriously detracts from the enjoyable experience of watching this concert. Lets face it, you don't know or care who produced these dvds and what their video ""style"" is...you buy them to see and hear the Corrs.  If I wanted a music video, I'd be watching MTV. So why, every three minutes or so, do they have to turn black and white?  Do closeups of Andrea's nostrils contribute to my enjoyment of the group?  This concert is shot in a bizarre style.  Lots of very tight closeups (partial faces), frequent cuts, frequent cuts to slow motion and/or black and white, and odd camera angles.  Again, all of this is just distracting. If you must have Breathless and the In Blue hits, or want to collect all the Corrs concerts, then this is worthwhile.  But both Albert Hall and Lansdowne are more enjoyable concerts to watch.  I have a review posted of Lansdowne (far and away the best) if you want my two cents on it. Albert Hall is also a nice DVD, with a more intimate setting, excellent audio, Mick Fleetwood and more traditional video technique. But the London DVD is just too distracting.",1106352000,8,1719,4.5816993464052285
1641206,5,B00005OM5N,I could not take my eyes off this when I saw it at a friend's home a few months ago.  I had never heard of this band.  I immediately went out and bought it.  It is terrific.,1104364800,,173,3.6216216216216215
1641207,5,B00005OM5N,"I first discovered the Coors 4 years ago when ""Breathless"" hit the US charts and I saw their video on VH1.  I've always loved the Irish/Celtic genre and thought the Coor's sound was unique. I bought their ""Breathless"" CD and thought it was okay--perhaps a little over produced.  I questioned whether the band were really good muscians.  Then I bought their ""Unplugged"" CD--which sounds incredible and really shows how talented these siblings are.  Knowing that their CD's can sound over produced at times and that I enjoy their live sound (from ""Unplugged""), I had been wanting to get one of their concert DVD's.  ""Live in London"" was worth the wait.  The sound is great--the lighting awesome-the band is talented--song selection is broad and versatile.  24-25 songs is a quite a few for any concert DVD! The camera shots are well done--alternate camera angles are available on 4-5 songs.  A great buy--I highly recommend it! It's unfortunate the Coors have not been more successful in the US.  They certainly have more musical ability than a lot of the pop acts that have made it big in the US in recent years.",1099958400,,1111,4.8052631578947365
1641208,4,B00005OM5N,"This DVD surprised me alot. I am now wishing I went to the London concert. The DVD quality is excellent, the audio, the 5 camera angles and also the content such as awesome extras like interviews and such. My favourite song to watch is definetely TOSS THE FEATHERS and GIVE ME A REASON. Subtitles for lyrics are an added bonus. I think that a bit more extra features should've been added and it would of been excellent, but still this DVD is excellent.",1097971200,,452,4.457831325301205
1641209,5,B00005OM5N,"Three weeks ago my wife and I had the pleasure of seeing the Corrs perform live in Woodinville Washington.  After watching them perform on a cable special several years ago we became instant fans and had purchased a couple of their popular CD's.  All family members ago blessed with talent, good looks, and the discipline to become excellent artists.  If you enjoy popular music and celtic music you cannot just love this group.  The video was just like the concert when viewed on our thome theater with 5.1 dts.

What surprises me is that they have not become more popular in the U.S.  When asked about the concert, most of our friends and family new little about the group if anything at all.  This should tell us about the strong influence of PR campaigns and promoted airplay, etc.  Every member of this family has a lot more talent than Brittany Spears and there are 4 of them in one group!  Does anybody not know who Brittany Spears is?

I do know that this group is very popular internationally and are more concerned with making good enjoyable music than making publicity for themselves.  Enough of the my statement about American Pop culture.  Listen to the music and watch them perform.  They will put you in a good mood and will have you humming and singing their songs in your head for a long time...",1092873600,2,1312,4.579399141630901
1641210,5,B00005OM5N,"Maybe I'm biased because I've been a hardcore(pardon the pun) and dedicated fan of the band for years, but this DVD rocks! It's the fabulous Irish band live from Wembley stadium in London on their tour for In Blue. It includes a lot of favorite from the band, i.e. Runaway and So Young, and also many others. It's a great DVD with lots of fun moment and cool extras! A MUST HAVE FOR ANY CORRS FAN OR COLLECTOR(like myself).",1085529600,,423,4.367088607594937
1641211,5,B00005OM5N,"It's a shame we don't see more of this group here in the states - America doesn't know what it's missing! This phenomenally talented Irish pop group is simply amazing. I highly recommend their unique blend of traditional and pop sounds. Not to mention, the three sisters are beautiful to boot! I saw this group on Good Morning America and fell in love with them. I now own just about all of their CDs and live performances on DVD. This video is a must!!!",1081209600,2,454,4.416666666666667
1641212,5,B00005OM5N,"Wow, what a very talented, fine group of muscicians.
I just bought this dvd yesterday on this
guys review alone (Reviewer: John Dunning from Friday Harbor, Washington USA ) Thank you very much!.. after
I read what you wrote..I had to go out and get it. (couldn't
even wait on an amazon order!)
I've never heard of this group and got the link
from amazon.. on a prior music selection..
Well, I have watched this practically all weekend, can't get enough of it.
Highly recommended, I could say a lot more.. but
most of it's already been covered in  prior reviews.
Very glad I discovered this group.. not too many
musical artists of the past decade has got my attention like this
one has.  Very alive and refreshing.. and they perform
every song with
such a passion..one of the best concert dvd's
I've seen in a long time..",1079827200,2,820,4.533783783783784
1641213,5,B00005OM5N,"With my Irish background maybe I'm a bit biased. Seriously, though, great concert footage, excellent selection of songs, and the camera work was fantastic. Not a lot of jumpiness with the angles. The specific camera angles on each band member during, Breathless, Dreams and, Radio is quite good.  The sisters are a pleasure to watch and a delight to hear.  Wicked good Dolby 5.1 sound with a subwoofer booming.  Now if only I can get to see them live.",1070582400,,451,4.6835443037974684
1641214,4,B00005OM5N,"This is not a review for the performance of the Corrs on this DVD.  Other reviewers have provided good information.  I bought this DVD because of their reviews.  I would like to share my perception with other people who may be interested in getting this DVD that this DVD has been overdubbed.  An overdubbed concert DVD may please people who prefer the results of overdubbing but I would rather enjoy the impact of seeing the image of the voice and music being actually created.  I am still interested in this group and if they have a DVD that has not been overdubbed, I would like to buy it.  I am inviting those who may disagree with my perception to respond to this review.",1069027200,2,676,4.455284552845528
1641215,5,B00005OM5N,"Caught a couple of their songs while surfin' the cable channels and remembered their name when I came across this DVD in a Frye's store. I was totally unprepared to be so captivated and enthralled with their skills and performance. I went back to the store a week later and bought the Albert Hall DVD and the Best of the Corrs videos, but this one remains my favorite. I absolutely cannot get enough of ""Radio"". Some words and phrases come to mind when I think of each of the girls, with Caroline it's ""Hurt me again, please"", with Sharon it's ""Class, Elegance, Cream"", with Andrea it's ""Bruised rose petals"". I may have to buy a spare disk or two just to make sure that I have a viewable one for the rest of my life, which ain't all that long as I turn 63 in a couple of months. Bottom line, if you have any love of music at all and listen with any degree of passion and emotion, then you must have this disk!!!!",1057536000,4,913,4.222857142857142
1641216,5,B00005OM5N,"When I bought this DVD, I knew it would be brilliant just because it was, The Corrs!!!  I've been a fan of them since 2000 and have bought all of their studio albums and a few imports.  It's nice to see a pop/rock/Irish influenced family band with a positive image having international success.  I watched this London concert and it totally blew me away.  The song selections are great and the picture quality is extraordinary.  I also bought Kylie Minogue's ""FEVER 2002"" tour and it was wonderful as well.  But even though The Corrs don't have the high tech effects, flashy costumes, and dancers, they still deliver.  In my opinion, much better than Kylie.  This is a great DVD for any Corrs fans or any person who loves live music from a great band.  You won't be disappointed.  My whole family enjoyed this DVD and are all interested in The Corrs now.  It's also nice to see ""Irresistable"" Andrea shake her bum and run around on the stage singing on a few of the songs too.  A-Class material without a doubt.  Ireland should be proud.",1049155200,3,1037,4.54054054054054
1641217,5,B00005OM5N,"My thirty-something son, twenty-five years my junior, told me about a group called The Corrs several years ago.  Since his musical taste and mine have never been too similar, I shortly forgot the group's name, and didn't listen to their music.  That was until about a month ago, when I happened to buy The Corrs - Live in London, along with five other concert DVD's to view in our new home theatre.  Wow!  Now I'm a believer and after viewing this DVD for the first time, immediately called my son to apologize for doubting his recommendation.
The video, on a large screen front projection basis doesn't seem to be as good as a movie DVD, but does an excellent job of conveying the energy of this group.  The sound, on the otherhand, is absolutely spectacular, particularly when listened to on the DTS tracks.  The reason is that DTS, unlike Dolby Digital, doesn't use a compression process, which can definitely degrade the subtleties of music like this.  Regardless, the sheer magnitude of this group's musical talent is almost more than I can stand.  They sing beautifully, each play a variety of instruments and have arranged a wonderful group of musical performances that truly blow you away!
I absolutely love the Irish influence evident in the music, and everything about the arrangements themselves.  Anyone that can listen to this music, at a reasonably similar sound level as the original performance would provide, and not start moving their feet or body, isn't alive.  Don't miss the opportunity to own this magnificent music DVD.
Did I say they are three of the most beautiful women (sisters) I've ever seen perform together, plus of course, Jim (their brother)?  And Caroline has to be one of the best drummers I have ever seen!  The final result...you're in for a real treat.",1047168000,31,1790,4.832786885245902
1641218,5,B00005OM5N,"that sums up this concert DVD nicely and I can not recommend it highly enough:
Beautiful music.
Beautiful pictures.
Beautiful people.
Beautiful sound quality.
This London concert was shot in digital video shot and is presented in anamorphic widescreen.  And it's appropriate because it's hard to imagine 3 more beautiful subjects for the camera than Andrea, Sharon, and Caroline Corr (I suppose the ladies might say the same about Jim).
Miles above the trashy norm of flesh, profanity and sleaze in popular music today, the Corrs sing a siren's song that is incredibly seductive, genuine, and entertaining that everyone can enjoy young or old.  That alone represents stellar talent.
It might be tempting to pass the Corrs off as just another girl band.  But you would be missing some very talented and polished musicians and songwriters bar none.  Each Corr wears at least 2 hats (sometimes 3) during a tune and keep a guest bassist and lead guitarist busy as well.
Before I purchased this DVD I liked and was familiar with their songs.  I purchased this DVD mainly because it is one of the few anamorphic widescreen concert videos.  But after buying it I can say that I'm a huge fan.
Who should buy this DVD:
1. Any casual Corrs fan.
2. Any rabid Corrs fan.
3. Any videophile needing a reference DVD for sound and picture (it's that good) (at least the dolby, I have not tried the DTS).
4. Any fan of popular music.",1043452800,24,1416,4.712550607287449
1641219,5,B00005OM5N,"I don't buy recordings of concerts. Very often, they are so staged and over-dramatized that the music is lost amongst the theatrics. This DVD, however, is proof that great concerts can be immortalized on film -- and if you want to experience a great show, the Corrs are a sure bet.
Recorded at London's Wembley Arena in December 2000, this show is packed with energy, adrenaline, audience participation, and, of course, great music. On this DVD, you can experience the passion of 'Only When I Sleep' and 'Runaway', the mysticism of 'Dreams' and 'Forgiven Not Forgotten', the energy of 'No More Cry' and 'So Young', and the overall greatness of 'Breathless' and 'What Can I Do'.
The Corr siblings are amazing performers, and it really shines through at this concert. They are passionate about their music, yet sing with a professional gracefulness lacking in many acts. When Andrea Corr laments about lost love, you believe her, but she doesn't need to smash guitars or take off all her clothes to get her point across. This is a show that I WOULD watch with my parents -- there is nothing hard or obscene about it.
The special features are a nice bonus for those wishing for something a little extra. ""Access All Areas"" is a half-hour documentary behind the scenes of a day in the life of the band, from rehearsals to performace, as well as their thoughts on performing, writing, and traveling as a group. The special camera angles are a great way to view your favorite band member throughout a song -- for instance, I can watch Caroline Corr play the drums without interrupting shots of her siblings. The bonus track, 'Happy XMas (War Is Over)' is a classic holiday song played with a gentleness the John Lennon would've admired.
One of my biggest regrets about living in the United States is that I have not been able to experience the Corrs live. This DVD has allowed me to ""attend"" a concert and feel the passion, excitement, and fun that goes into a live show -- all without leaving my living room.",1040860800,6,2003,4.6770538243626065

The short documentary included on the disc is fun too and includes some snippets from various Corrs music videos that I wish to god they would put on a DVD collection for us poor USA fans that never got to see them!
