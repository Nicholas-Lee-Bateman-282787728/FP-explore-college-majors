When I got the replacement it also had two discs with the UFC 50 label.  Instead of sending it back this time, I put them in the player to check if it was just the label, and the first one is in fact the DVD for UFC 49 but was just mis-labeled.  I guess there must be a batch of these that went out with the wrong label printed on the discs.",1248912000,7,499,3.8155339805825244

UFC 49
First off another reviewer is wrong, the fight where Couture gets a cut really fast is UFC 46: Supernatural.  Not this event.  That's why there is unfinished business as Randy Couture looks to get his belt back.

UFC 50
BJ Penn left the UFC to fight in K1, so the UFC needs to establish a new champion.  Matt Hughes, the most dominant WW Champ to this day (unless GSP can cement a legacy with more defenses), faces off against a young Georges St. Pierre.  Also Tito Ortiz was scheduled to face off against Guy Mezger in their third battle, but Mezger had a stroke, so Patrick Cote steps up from the preliminary bout to fight Ortiz.  This was a good move on Patrick's part that gained him a lot of respect.

Both events contain great fights and you can't go wrong with any MMA purchase if you are an MMA fan.  Support the sport.",1237248000,,858,4.352201257861635
