445624,1,6302261597,I just had to write a review to bring the ranking down a little bit.  This movie is quite simply not funny.  Mel Brooks is trying to make some profound social statement which makes for really bad comedy.  The social statement is so cliche that it was the only part of the movie that made me laugh.,991008000,4,297,4.175438596491228
445625,5,6302261597,"No, this is not your typical Mel Brooks comedy; loaded down with relentless slapstick comedy and sight-gags!  IT'S TEN TIMES BETTER!  Life Stinks, unlike other Mel Brooks movies, has real heart and soul. Yes, it's  funny; but it's also very touching.  In the movie, you get to  ""meet"" some homeless people, who make you realize that; hey, they  have real feelings and personalities too! I don't feel the movie pokes fun  of the homeless; instead, it pokes fun at the rich guy who loses his cloak  of money and then can't deal with the ""realities"" of life -(thus  proclaiming, Life Stinks)!  Again, this movie is NOT typical Mel Brooks, if  that's what you're expecting.  However, if you ARE  expecting a movie that  is wonderfully entertaining and worth viewing over and over again, then you  definitely WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!  BUY IT, AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELF!",950659200,27,862,4.841379310344828

And what does it show to the rest of the world?, how can America be # 1?, when so many people are living in tent cities and shelters from coast to coast...Mel Brooks, what a mensch, I love everything he's done, There will be film study classes about him years from now...

445670,5,6302261597,"This one was released in 1991 and came and went with nary a whimper.  You've got to be kidding me?  You mean people preferred ""Spaceballs"" and ""Robin Hood, Men in Tights""?  Without question this was Brooks' finest effort since ""Young Frankenstein"".  This was Mel with a social conscience and he was mad as hell!  The hospital emergency room scene alone beats anything in Paddy Chayefsky's overbaked ""The Hospital"".  Chaplinesque would be the best descriptive adjective for this film.  Mel was never one to bludgeon one with a message so what he does is subtly tickle your funny bone so you get it.  Mel takes the lead role as a greedy tycoon who agrees to live in the worst Los Angeles slum on a bet with a competitor and he's never been more appealing.  He's matched here by a winsome Lesley Ann Warren as a transient who shelters Mel's character.  The seductively innocent dance sequence that Brooks and Warren have in this film is classic.  Notoriously Mel had a history of not knowing how to end his films, take ""Blazing Saddles"" for example, but here the conclusion is note perfect.  If one knows Mel's history as a filmmaker his debut film ""The Producers"" was dismissed by the critics only to develop a cult following.  Mel would later win the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in 1968 for that film.  The writing in ""Life Stinks"" is on that level.",1512864000,2,1355,4.662447257383966

Void of all resources, if Bolt can live among the homeless for a month, he can develop the area; if not, the other millionaire gets the prime real estate. This is a typical Mel Brooks film with sight gags and off-beat humor. There are a lot of funny moments and a decent plot. Lesley Ann Warren stands out as a homeless bag lady.

I went to a lot of trouble with my computer to watch this and paid money for it. Like I said, it was sort of okay.",1474070400,,370,4.228571428571429
445728,2,6302261597,"Mel Brooks at his best can deliver some clever lines and sharp insight.  Do not look for anything like that here.  Brooks wrote, directed, produced and stars in this stumbling take on modern urban commentary.
  Uber rich Brooks bets his rich buddies that he can survive on the streets of LA in a derelict neighborhood for 30 days.  He agrees to wear an ankle bracelet to make sure that he stays in the neighborhood.  The prize for the bet is the neighborhood itself.  These guys are rich.  Brooks tries to milk the situation for laughs but the situation does not lend itself to humor.  On of the homeless guys, a friend of sorts of the rich guy trying to survive, dies.  Not funny.  The dead guy they called sailor and he wanted have his ashes set out to sea as his last wish.  The best the homeless band can do is to dump the ashes into the languid stream of the LA River, more of a storm drain than a river, in hopes that the water will reach the sea eventually with the ashes.  The homeless folk fail even in this tragic attempt.
  The one bit that worked for me had Brooks punched in the head and knocked over the border of the designated neighborhood, repeatedly.  He would get punched out, fall over the line, scramble back into his proper zone only to be knocked out again.  Funny bit that.  Mentally ill people self medicating with cheap booze and eating from garbage cans, not so funny.
  The cast includes Lesley Ann Warren, Jeffrey Tamber and Billy Bartly along with Brooks himself.  They should have found something else to do.  The public didn't like it either.  The film cost $13 million to make but brought in a tiny $4 million at the box office.  PG-13, One hour and 32 minutes.",1468022400,,1694,4.407766990291262

445730,4,6302261597,"I saw this was coming on TV a few days ago.  I set it to record.  I was born in 85, so I missed Mel Brooks movies.  I knew the types of movies he made, so I set my mind to Brooks.

This movie was different than others I have watched from him.  It seemed a bit darker.  The movie really is him in the slumps.  It has a few actors in it.  There are a hand full of characters that matter.  This did have his humor in it.  But, it seemed to be more story driven than comedy.  I thought it was fun.  Brooks movies are the type I would like to make one day.  Keep in mind; this is different than others of his.

I liked it so much, that the next day, I got it from Amazon.  I look forward to getting it and watching with my grandparents, then my mom and step dad.",1463702400,,757,3.732484076433121

The quality of the blu-ray is fantastic, good presentation for the film itself.

The movie itself isn't one of my favorite Mel Brooks movies, but it's not a bad one.  There are no ""bad"" Mel Brooks films in my opinion.  This one suffers from not being laugh out loud funny in very many places.  It has a lot of heart and a fun/nice story, but it tosses the laughs out the window to make room for it.  An enjoyable film to watch, but don't expect to be rolling on the floor like with many of his other movies.

Still a great addition to the collection and a nice movie to sit back and enjoy.",1442188800,,819,4.2387096774193544

445893,4,6302261597,"Refreshing to see a movie made in Los Angeles instead of always in New York City, even if it wasn't one of the prettier parts of LA.
Life Stinks DOES have funny scenes but it's also a great story about a serious subject: Being homeless and trying to survive without a penny.  There are some scenes that would make anyone with a shred of empathy for others tear up. But this movie conveys so much hope and encouragement to the homeless that its not ever depressing or maudlin. Amid all of the terrible things, good things happen to the homeless folks once in a while. They stick together and help each other just like in real life. Theres a lot of triumph at the end. If you ARE homeless or ever have been, the film will validate you instead of upsetting you.
The funny scenes do NOT make jokes at either homeless or mentally ill peoples expense as some seem to think. (Plenty of digs at crooked lawyers, though) While homeless people really do have to do demeaning things to be able to eat, Goddard Bolts (Mel Brooks) effort to raise money when hes hungry IS funny. Bolt (Brooks) is fond of bragging about his wealth and has a compulsion to keep doing so, even while hes homeless.  He keeps running into a guy whos convinced hes J. Paul Getty, and always has to one up Bolt with his own fictitious stories about his fictitious wealth. Every time they see each other you know theres going to be trouble.  One of the funniest parts is when the evil villain Vance Crasswell (Jeffrey Tambor) gets what he had coming.
While most of the content about homelessness is accurate, Im giving it four stars instead of five because an important part of the story is bogus: At the beginning, Molly (Leslie Ann Warren) COULD pass for a real homeless woman. But as she becomes romantically interested in Goddard her face is perfectly made up with high quality cosmetics, her skin and hair are in perfect condition and shes been seeing a good hairdresser. Shes supposedly been homeless with no income for eight years? I think not!  She wouldnt even really have access to a mirror, or to all the basic hygiene items that she needed like deodorant, toothpaste, a razor or a place to shower every day. Doubtful her teeth would still be in that good of condition, either.  For safety reasons, real homeless women who are naturally attractive have to downplay their looks, anyway. If she had had zero income for eight years she would probably have serious and untreated medical problems keeping her from working or even concentrating well enough to file for disability, thus also keeping her from being ready to succeed in a serious, healthy relationship right off the bat.  These details might seem trivial until we consider that they would probably, in real life, keep the story from ending the way it did.
The few other inaccuracies are minor ones, and the garbage and trash everywhere, people forced to sleep outside and in dumpsters in all kinds of weather, critically ill people going without healthcare, hordes of mice (except the cockroaches and flies are missing,)  the panhandlers, people so hungry they're looking through the garbage for food, are all dead on.
Ultimately, it's an upbeat and entertaining film about a very serious topic. I highly recommend it.",1426809600,,3249,4.689473684210526

And that's great. I love it when an artist does something that is outside of what he normally does. It's not the funniest movie that I've ever seen, but I had some moments in the film where I laughed pretty damn hard, and even some parts that made me feel bad for the characters and their lot in life.

Goddard Bolt (an insulated, clueless member of the 1%) accepts a bet from a ruthless, smarmy competitor...masterfully played by character actor Jeffrey Tambor...that he will survive on the mean city streets of L.A. without his wealth and contacts for 30 days. Along the way, he meets a number of down and outers, becomes self-aware and learns what it's like for thousands who literally have to live hand-to-mouth. Although it can't be classified as one of the great muckraking exposes of the century, it's an engaging and surprisingly thoughtful bit of entertainment which might inspire you to volunteer at a soup kitchen now and then.

When one watches this film, one comes away with a deep sense of the very serious side of the homeless issues--exposure to assault, illness, limited access to medical care, poor diet, estrangement from family and friends, mental and physical stress--so much beyond the misunderstanding and contempt of those who are housed and employed, and who may view the homeless as mere leeches on the backs of those who are more fortunate. Brooks shines a light of recognition and acknowledgment on the invisible and forgotten disenfranchised of this nation. His humorous treatment of a very serious subject makes it all the more poignant.
I owned this movie in VHS, and, as the technology changed, wanted to make certain that this incredible movie should remain a part of my collection.

446002,1,6302261597,"A witless and hollow comedy starring Mel Brooks as a billionaire who makes a bet that he could survive on the streets for 30 days. The beginning gags got a chuckle from me and some of the stuff that followed too like the bit with a piece of corn on someone's face. However, a majority of these gags you can see a mile away; You know that hand on the floor will be stepped on, you see that car will run over that puddle and splash people, and it's like this for most of the film. This is amateur hour. This came from the mind who wrote and directed The Producers '68 and Young Frankenstein ?  Trading Places, an infinitely smarter film, took their characters for granted. They reacted to the situations they were in and they delivered comedy gold.  Here Brooks' character is too lazy even to be funny, he just bums through this picture like he knows he'll get his money back and have a happy ending.

What's just as bad, or possibly worse, is that the film tries to be more than what it is. At one point of the hobos Brooks meets up with dies on the sidewalk and the death is clearly emphasized for pathos. Then the next scene involves a comedic attempt to dispose of his ashes at ""sea"". The awkward nature of lumping in tradegy with comedy didn't work and it happens one too many times in film.

I really am baffled by Brooks' output in the past 25 years. Spaceballs was fun, definetly not close to his early genius, but fun nonetheless but now he can't even accomplish that level of middling comedy anymore.",1290124800,2,1508,4.336879432624113

446015,4,6302261597,"When you name your movie ""Life Stinks"", and the movie isn't a comedy classic like ""Blazing Saddles"" or ""Young Frankenstein"", then you get set up for harsh remarks like ""This Movie Stinks"". And that's too bad, because this is a smaller film with more heart & soul which doesn't try to BE those comedies. This one has a different tone & purpose. It's not a genre parody like Brooks' past work, but one which addresses a real life issue: That of society's division between the wealthy and that of the impoverished. Brooks casts himself as multi-millionaire Goddard Bolt, a callous, uncaring man who sets his sights on bulldozing 2 1/2 miles of Los Angeles' most destitute property--which happens to be the ""home"" of the homeless. But first, Bolt must secure the other half of ownership from his business rival, an even more unscrupulous (and sneaky) man played with controlled oiliness by Jeffrey Tambor. A bet is made based on whether Bolt can survive on these same streets for thirty days (of course, Tambor tricks Bolt out of his fortune during this time). What transpires as survival for Bolt is also a life lesson as he learns firsthand how harsh life is for these homeless people. Along the way, he befriends a feisty bag lady (Lesley Ann Warren, who made a one-note character in ""Victor/Victoria"" hilarious, and works the same magic here), a spindly old man named Sailor (a surprisingly restrained performance from Howard Morris), and a lanky, boozy bum (Teddy Wilson). The dramatic scene when Sailor is left for dead on a sidewalk--and no one seems to care--speaks volumes about society's views of the homeless. Of course, the movie isn't without some wonderful highlights: The joyous dance between Brooks & Warren in a warehouse full of rags; Brooks, having hit rock bottom, in an overcrowded hospital hallway, being repeatedly pumped full of thorazine by an absent-minded doctor; an outrageous slap fight between Brooks & Rudy DeLuca (delivering a very funny performance here as a ranting, delusional bum); Brooks, after finding his rival has broken him, tries to walk out of his former mansion with valued (and bulky) posessions; and a climactic battle between Brooks & Tambor, using cranes in a scene which plays out like a dinosaur fight.
The bottom line: If you want a raucous, rowdy comedy that's belly laughs from start to finish, then watch ""Saddles""; if you want something more genteel & sweet between the laughs, then watch this one.",1256428800,5,2449,4.932203389830509

446021,5,6302261597,"Well, it is like a musical.  Mel Brooks is a theater man (think ""Producers"") and a musical man.
I thought it was great, in fact me and my husband must be old bores because we watched it at least 4 times over the past several years.
It is a great story, even if not as funny as some other Mel's efforts.
I love Mel Brooks.",1208822400,,321,3.9384615384615387
446032,5,6302261597,"Mel Brooks "" Life Stinks"" is a very funny movie, I think Mel Brooks played the part well, one of the other reviews state "" he was making fun of the homeless with this movie"" I have my opion and I don't think this is what he intended to do.  he was just showing that you can take a person from a wealthy family and put them in a situation to see if they can survive, in the end he gave back to the homeless and also married one. In todays society there are a lot of kids that need to see what it's like to do without and they would appreciate what they have. However, the movie was not ment to poke fun at anyone nor to belittle anyone , it was just ment to be funny, and humor is good for the soul.
I've seen this movie about 10 times and now am going to be the proud owner of it, because I am tired of waiting to see it on the television.",1200960000,,839,3.7942857142857145
446033,5,6302261597,"I honestly thought this movie would stink ... It wasn't very popular when it came out .. We watched it on satellite TV and I predicted we would watch only 5 minutes before we changed channels ..Wrong.. Life Stinks turned out to be one of our favorite movies ... . A lot of great themes touched upon, some very real life situations (more than Trading Places did), and over a dozen very funny scenes .. add up to a great movie .. Thanks Mel ..",1190160000,,441,4.2
446034,5,6302261597,"After being criticized for producing mostly spoof movies, Mel Brooks departed from that genre and returned to the semi-real world of his early two films ""The Producers"" and ""The Twelve Chairs.""  ""Life Stinks"" is a Chaplinesque fable that focused on the very real problems of America's homeless.  While it was met with indifference by the moviegoing public and critics took turns hurling brickbats, practically inviting derision due to the title, there were a few perceptive reviewers who recognized that this was Brooks' most sincere and daring effort in years.  Perhaps if the title of this film had been ""Life Is Beautiful,"" it would have met a different fate.  Nevertheless, this film is an important entry into the Brooks canon.  Putting his money where his mouth is, Mel Brooks made a strong social statement as well as an entertaining film.  It's his most personal work since ""The Producers.""",1177113600,7,898,5.074829931972789

If Mel hasn't and doesn't flip your switch, well, you may as well skip this one. Probably not the strongest screenplay ever filmed, but I liked it and recommend it.",1158710400,,316,4.660714285714286

446037,3,6302261597,I think it might have been fun if it was a musical instead of movie. The homeless lady's face was so clean with make-up that she did not look like homeless. Not a very good movie.,1146355200,2,179,4.0
446038,5,6302261597,"I bought ""Life Stinks (VHS)"" and I agree that it has what we call comedy, the comedy is not like Naked Gun theme but a classic touch of the 80's and 90's. I will gladly order it on DVD!

The story is about a millionaire who is interested in gaining profits and likes to play bets with other rich business man. He put him self in a deep hole when he accepted the bet to rip him self of all the luxuries he had for 1 month and spend 30 days with homeless people, in this 30 days the fun part begins!

Whenever I get meloncholy over memories of the old hood, I put LIFE STINKS on and concentrate on the positive experiences and pine.
