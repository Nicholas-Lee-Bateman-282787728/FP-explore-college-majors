6017182,5,B00FPPQYXM,"We are hooked on this lovely series set in Port Wenn. Martin Clunes is fabulous as the Doc. From the moment the opening music for that wonderful seaside town starts, we are engaged. So look forward to each and every episode and have series 1-5. Very excited to preorder series 6, but hoping the producers will continue beyond that!
Can't imagine not having Doc Martin to look forward to. Helps us relax, laugh, and forget any and all woes for an hour.
A wonderfully endearing show!

6017184,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I definitely will preorder this. It will be my treat for Christmas. This series is delightful. I watched 1-5 on Amazon Prime during my summer off from teaching. The humor is actually funny, the relationships are hysterical. I can't wait. Thank you Amazon.",1383436800,54,255,4.953488372093023
6017185,5,B00FPPQYXM,Absolutley thrilled to learn today there will be a Series 6 of Doc Martin.  It tops the list of favorites for most in my group of friends. Hard part will be waiting for the DVD to be available for purchase. Hope the series goes on well past #6!,1382918400,83,244,4.083333333333333
6017186,5,B00FPPQYXM,"THIS 6th AND LAST OF THE SERIES IS THE BEST ONE SO FAR.  IT'S A SHAME WE WILL NO LONGER BE SEEING THE CHARACTERS OF PORTWENN AND THE ADVENTURES OF DR.ELLINGHAM - HOPEFULLY, ALL CONCERNED IN PRODUCING THIS SERIES WILL CHANGE THEIR MIND - WOULD LOVE TO SEE JAMES HENRY GROW UP AND SEE HOW MARTIN RELATES TO HIM.",1382918400,130,309,4.237288135593221
6017187,5,B00FPPQYXM,"A new series of Doc Martin seems to be a treat we can look forward two every two years.  That was how long we had to wait for Season 5 and now there has been a further two year wait for Season 6.  However, the good news is that, whereas for a while it did look like Season 5 was to be the last, Martin Clunes recently said that if Series 6 was well received then the show would continue.  I would imagine that the script writers would not have any problem writing new stories for the gentle folk of Port Wenn almost indefinitely so hopefully Doc Martin will be with us for some time to come.

Doc Martin was formerly a successful surgeon in London before a phobia for blood drove him to his current position as GP in this sleepy Cornish village in the West of England.  With a deadpan face and no apparent people skills, he is not well equipped to deal with the eccentric inhabitants.  It is amazing how often a largely expressionless face speaks volumes!  One wonders how the long suffering Louise manages to put up with him, but clearly she does as this series opens with them preparing at last for their wedding.  However, as we might have expected, things on the day and subsequently run far from smoothly.

As in the last series, child minding arrangements for Baby James are an ongoing issue.  This time the Doc falls out with the regular minder, and her temporary replacement does not prove to be entirely satisfactory.  Meanwhile, when he is drafted in to take the baby to a mother and toddlers group, he does not seem to blend in very well!  Neither does he endear himself with the unfortunate Louisa when he invites her school Chairman of Governors and wife around to dinner - it does not prove to be a perfect evening and this was one of the funnier episodes of the series.  However, often the action revolves around other characters such as Bert or PC Penhale and Doc Martin and family are in the background, although the series does finish on a note of high drama.

You really cannot imagine anyone apart from Martin Clunes playing the part of Doc Martin and Port Wenn provides us with a gentle and charming show which we very much look forward to.  Personally I do hope that Doc Martin does continue as it is certainly among the best of our TV viewing currently.

6017198,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I wish there were all Doc Martins treating us.  He's a no-nonsense, get to the bottom of this, address the issue and move on type of doctor. I like that. So many want a doctor with a great bedside manner, someone to hold their hand. I want a professional who knows what he's doing and does it well.  Martin Clune is so believable in anything he does, whether comedy, for which he got his start, or this comedy/drama of Doc Martin.  Seeing Port Wenn makes one want to find a place like that and move to it as it's so beautiful.  Each of the characters in this series are so good in their roles.  I want the entire series to watch over and over.  Keep filming Doc Martin!",1516752000,,669,4.1875

6017230,3,B00FPPQYXM,"Another British slice of the collapse of civilization.  Village idiots, trashy teens, fat single moms, bratty kids, inept government officials, stupid (and not particularly funny) patients, and the ubiquitous simmering anger of the age.

 Louisa yearns for  the time-honored and beautiful (Martin's word) life of wife and mother, but feels compelled by her neurotic fears to instead force herself into a frenetic life of feminism, compulsive girlishness and psuedo-lover.

As Louisa blindly lives her unachievable fantasy of being wonder woman + virginal fairy princess, she's about 5 years away from menopause and 20 pounds.  Will she face it as a bitter divorcee, or a cherished companion of a man she loves and trust?  Why even make it a choice, strung over 7 series?!  The neglected man who otherwise would have been great, the latch-key child,  the socialized school and clinic,  the coldness of a new night.  Does Louisa, like so many unfortunate victims of her generation, have many ""values"" but no truths?

So... if I'm so critical, why did I watch the entire show?!  I'm madly in love with Dr. Ellingham, of course!  If Louisa won't hang on his every word like a devoted partner, I will!  And so will you!  Enjoy!",1495411200,,1222,4.975247524752476
6017231,5,B00FPPQYXM,"The first episode sets the hilarious tone for the season, as Doc Martin and his longtime significant other approach the alter to exchange matrimonial vows, or will as soon as the significant other shows up.  Meanwhile, PC Penhall organizes his wedding speech, and other Portwenn residents prepare a honeymoon for the bride and groom, one with the potential to turn into the honeymoon from hell.  Suffice to say, Doc Martin's disposition will not be greatly improved by the nuptials and the horrifically hilarious aftermath.  This episode and the season are highly recommended to fans of the series.",1495324800,,598,5.144329896907217

6017234,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I am in love with Doc Martin - seriously in love with the series.  it will be a sad day when it finally ends.  Our station in Wisconsin has just finished airing Series 5.  Series 6 will be some time in the late fall of 2017.  I could not wait that long!  I was so happy that I could buy Series 6 & 7 so I can sit and watch them at my leisure.  The DVD is fine, no problems with it and the series is as much fun as always.  The wedding was a bit strange, too strange,  It would have been nice if they would have let poor Louisa have a wonderful honeymoon, but alas, not to be.  We all hope for the best for Louisa.  I hope when it does come to an end it will be a happy ending.  it would be sad to have it end with Louisa's heart broken.",1493942400,,736,3.6838709677419357
6017235,5,B00FPPQYXM,"'Doc Martin' is one of those shows, I have found that gets better as it ages. However, the first year was very entertaining. There was something a little hit strange about he main character, Doc Martin, played by Martin Clunes, but, since he was a surgeon, that made some sense.

Dr. Martin Ellingham, a London surgeon developed a horrible reaction to the sight of blood. He also dies not have a good bedside manner, and he looks for another job. A GP is needed in a small village in a Cornish fishing village. He had spent summers there and, indeed, loved the area.

Martin was written and created by Dominic Minghella. Martin became the charmless, and insensitive physician, who is a brilliant diagnostician. He is so impossible I felt myself rooting for him. He is an off beat but good man. Once he is in the village, he sets up an office, people come by just to see him, and then they all develop unusual conditions, that he can almost always solve. In the process he falls in love with the schoolteacher Louisa, played by Carolyn Catz. She discovers she is attracted to him, but she doesn't really like him.

Every week a new medical condition is discovered, often including a interesting storyline. Doc Martin gains weight and loves the town. The town is an intricate turn of hillside streets and scenic overlooks. The town characters are the receptionists Lucy Punch and Katherine Parkinson; Ian McNeice, as a plumber ; Joe Absolom as McNeice's son; Stewart Wright and John Marquez as police constables, and Stephanie Cole as Martin's stubborn Aunt Joan. I began to think quite often that Doc Martin has Aspergers. He has all the characteristics. But, it makes no difference, really. This is a character who has soul, a romantic comedy we can all relate to.

6017325,4,B00FPPQYXM,"A Canadian friend with a dry sense of humor recommended this series.  Another friend said she thought it was best only through Season 4.  So I hesitated before buying Seasons 5 and 6 and read the reviews first.  The reviews were fascinating because in some cases the reviewers had nearly opposite responses!  I think both Seasons 5 and 6 are winners and enjoyed them thoroughly.  There is still plenty of humor to go around, and yes there is human drama also but I enjoy the depth and appreciate the compassion with which the writers deal with the character portrayals.  There is something in all of them that reminds us of people we know, and sometimes of ourselves.",1476662400,,667,4.6581196581196584

His steadfast, sometimes maddening, but still loveable character was so endearing, I decided to finally watch Doc Martin. I ended up sick in bed, and spent a lovely two and a half days binge-watching all seven seasons of Doc Martin. The cast is utterly loveable, the storylines not all together deep, but delightful, and you really feel like you could be a part of Port Wenn. I think, though, that six is my favorite season as Doc Martin finally comes face to face with his own weaknesses and has to make a choice.",1463097600,,575,4.538461538461538

I especially like the Doc Martin character, played by Martin Clunes.  Way back at the beginning of the series in Season One, you have a hard time believing that anyone could be as crotchety and anti-social as the doctor.  But, as the seasons go past, you receive very enlightening information about his childhood that helps you to understand his behaviours.  Worth watching.

When Louisa brings breakfast to his office and suggests a weekend getaway, he almost literally pushes her away.  And, at Sports Day, his behavior was dismissive and so callous that I thought the writer took it too far.  However, when Martin seeks advice from Aunt Ruth, she puts things in perspective for him, in that perhaps Martin feels he doesn't deserve Louisa (how could she love someone like him), and so he pushes her away.  This series highlights that human beings are complicated.",1458691200,,578,4.75

6017522,5,B00FPPQYXM,"What a character! Doc Martin is consistently a character but, so is everyone else in Port Wen. Louisa is beautiful as is the town, Bert is loveable and the eternal optimist, Joe is looking for love and determined to be successful at SOMETHING, Morwenna seems to be the most normal and calm of the bunch and Mrs. Tishel is eternally loyal but, not to her husband! When Mrs. Tishell remarks after Doc Martin walks out the door, ""I could just eat him with a spoon!"" I cracked up, which happens frequently when watching.",1453420800,,516,4.559139784946237
6017523,3,B00FPPQYXM,"The historical aspect of Sarah Mccoy's novel. The Baker's Daughter, was well done and original with its presentation of women's roles in WW2 Germany. Elsie's poignant story of a young girl working at her father's bakery was riveting. Women were kept under complete control by the rigid roles imposed by political dogma and male domination. While Elsie is nervous about attending her first Nazi party with a soldier twice her age, her sister Hazel is proud to be a sex worker producing babies for the Nazi Program.
The story's POV switches from Elsie's WW2 drama and fast forwards to 2008 where Reba's journey of self discovery is presented. Because Elsie's story is so humane and captivating, Reba's story comes off as almost frivolous. I found myself jolted when the author regularly dropped the WW2 story to update Reba's worries about her boyfriend and her job. Reba's connection to Elsie in the plot seems a little far-fetched in that she happened to be working on an article about an alternate view on Christmas when she visits the bakery.
Great recipes in the back of the novel and lots of baking insight into German pastry.",1453248000,,1130,4.860103626943006

6017529,5,B00FPPQYXM,"In real life, one might hope to never encounter a person like Doc Martin; but as a character, Martin Clunes plays the dyspeptic Doc to black comedy perfection.  And Mr. Clunes' physical comedy of knocking the Doc around, especially after having seen Louisa, is spot on brilliant.  Mr. Clunes is exceptional in expressing the inner world of the Doc through facial expressions, his manner of walk and other nonverbal means of acting.  Just wish I could have been a script supervisor over the seasons to remove inconsistencies both within the same season and across seasons.  I hope Season 8 is not the end, as Season 6 nearly was.",1452816000,,628,4.787037037037037
6017530,3,B00FPPQYXM,"I enjoyed the first 5 season of this program very much. There are some real ""characters"" in Port Wenn.

I just finished watching this, the 6th season, and to be honest, I didn't like it nearly as much as the earlier ones. The Doc seemed to have crossed the line from crotchety to mean too many times. And, the episodes just seemed a little too dark. Just spoiled all the fun I used to have watching.

The Doc's aunt Ruth is a great character in this season. I liked Aunt Joan (the one they killed off earlier on the show), but Ruth is even better. She seems to fit in with the others much better than the Doc does, and maybe that's the point.

Louisa and the Doc's baby is pretty cute - though it seems obvious that they are using multiple children to play the part - they don't look all that much alike if you ask me. It seems a real shame that the Doc and Louisa can't figure out how to get along better given they have a child.

The ""child minder"" was a great character. His OCD's made me feel a little sad for him. In a way, the Doc seemed to understand him - which was kind of a relief in that it let viewers feel that the Doc could be compassionate.

Mrs. Tischel was back. A little too weird for my taste.

Bert Large was back. A nice and amusing guy. I hear the actor who plays him has lost weight since this season filmed - glad to hear that for his health's sake. He had gotten really really heavy.

Many other favorite characters returned and some new ones debuted.

I hope season 7 will be more like 1-5.",1452384000,,1516,4.115254237288136
6017531,3,B00FPPQYXM,"Love the show, but this season  (or maybe it was the 5th season) seems to have lost its magic. It is turning into the ""Burt Large"" show since he is overly featured. Also, the episodes with Luisa's mom I think has brought the quality down to a soap opera level. There seems to be no charm to Martin's marriage and relationship with Luisa.  Maybe it is the directing, but I wasn't laughing as much as in the earlier seasons. Focus needs to be back on the quirky village folks,  unusual ailments, etc. and  on Martin Clunes.  Luisa just complains about Martin and there isn't any chemistry. Hope it gets a 7th season and gets back to the fun of the first 3 years.",1452211200,,660,4.333333333333333

6017574,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Doc Martin is one of our family's favorite television series! It is an English series but if you think that means dull and dry you have a delightful surprise in store! My wife and I have watched every episode in the first six seasons at least once! Doc Martin is a London surgeon who has a phobia about seeing blood. He decides to move to a small Yorkshire town where he hangs out his shingle as a GP. He falls in love with Louisa a schoolteacher and they have a child named James. The good doctor is irascible and does not entertain fools gladly! He can be rude, abrupt and hateful. He is, though, a good man and excellent doctor ! Martin is surrounded by a cast of eccentrics such as Bert Larger the fat restaurant owner and his son; his aunt who is a psychiatrist; a lamebrain policeman and several others. The stories are warmhearted and will make you both laugh and cry. If you are looking for good clean humor which can be enjoyed by the entire family then I urge you to meet Dr. Martin Ellingham and his
wonderful friends! Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1444867200,,1093,4.639175257731959

6017587,1,B00FPPQYXM,"I like the concept of Doc Martin and have enjoyed past seasons, but this season was a waste for me.
I would have liked to see the union of Martin and Louise'er be productive rather than the predictable disaster.
They are two people in the tops of their field and they should have known better than to marry, or their story should have been one of cumbersome success. The comedic story lines of the other characters wasn't enough to make up for the disaster of the union of Martin and Louise'er.
The only worthy part of this season was when Martin confronted his mother.",1443139200,,569,4.480769230769231

6017601,3,B00FPPQYXM,I adore this series and the actors however this last year the writing is lazy. same old stuff. The first episode is quite disturbing with the protracted and not amusing surgery scene. What ever was the point? I would hope that Martin would by now be developing in character and this year is more of the same grouchiness that mostly has no value to character development.  I love this series and want to see this family and village grow together.,1441065600,,445,4.5625

6017608,4,B00FPPQYXM,"I stumbled on to this show on Netflix this summer and binged on all 6 seasons. I am absolutely enthralled by the undying love between the wounded Doc Martin and the beautiful Louisa. Series 6 takes us on another roller coaster. Pulling the couple apart in a heart wrenching set of episodes.  Many folks have complained that there is no happily ever after for the couple. Happy endings are not the British way as I am told. I think that this season shows that getting married sometimes only exacerbates underlying emotional issues rather than fixing them. Doc's character is struggling with physical and emotional  distress. His mother pops in to confirm that he was unloved and unwanted as a child. Gosh what a hard thing to get over. Martin Clunes is very talented and with almost no dialogue he can show his deep love for Louisa and his absolute despair when things go sideways with just one look... no words needed. Looking forward to Series 7. Hope that there is at least one scene where the Doc finally opens up to himself and Louisa about the lonely childhood her must have endured. I do not expect a happy-go-lucky Doc but maybe a smile and an acknowledgement that everyone needs love, affirmation and the occasional cuddle.  Also want to give a shout out to Caroline Catz and the actress who plays Mrs Tishell. I think their talents bring much to the show.",1440547200,,1364,4.651452282157677

6017630,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Series 6 is a continuation of the success and trials of Doc Martin as he tries to manage  his  medical practice in Port Wenn, Britain and the circumstances involving the raising of  a son, James Henry, along with his love,  Louisa, who desires to continue her career at the local elementary  school.  Characters come and go as they filter in and out of those  lives.  It remains a very moving love story between Doc and Louisa as they cope  with existing challenges and the  facing of new ones !

You know that, deep down, he cares about everyone, but he just can't bring himself to show it. The show really should be entitled ""In Spite of Himself""!  The supporting cast is wonderful, too.  Everyone is a character, in every sense of that word!  Great writing and casting.  I hope the series continues, and that Doc Martin continues to thaw as a family man.",1438819200,,477,4.5

The fictional village of Portwenn makes you feel like you want to pack up and move there and become a part of the community....that's how realistic this show is.

She wants more compliments, attention, etc. from Martin but when does she ever compliment him in return? He has declared his love very eloquently several times. She doesn't reciprocate at all. He has to stay in Port Wenn because she would never leave. She wouldn't consider his reasonable suggestion that she take some time off to be with the baby. She snottily suggested that he could stay home. Everything has to be her way. She's spoiled and needy. She is NOT actually a strong woman at all.",1431129600,,601,4.574074074074074

6017718,3,B00FPPQYXM,"this entire series is delightful and funny but would be 100% better if the producer would eliminate Bert large (Ian McNeice) who becomes a horrible bore, The producer obviously thinks he's wonderful but everyone who has watched this show has the same opinion - get rid of McNeice in any future shows. Like many good series, this is running past its peak of series 1-5 and with 'Bert Large' dominating every scene, it time to toss it.",1430006400,,433,4.636363636363637

6017736,2,B00FPPQYXM,"I thought the first few seasons were rather charming, especially given the location.  However, it has since developed into a plot-weary, flat viewing experience and I doubt I'll watch all of Season 6.  How much grumpier can Martin get?  He's gotten on my nerves and I find nothing about the show that holds me to this series anymore.",1428364800,,333,4.706896551724138

6017739,5,B00FPPQYXM,"These characters continue to evolve in complexity, so this series just gets better and better. Doc Martin exemplifies an expression of Asperger syndrome that some viewers may be familiar with (we live with it). Louisa (Caroline Catz) seems to become less and less accepting of this condition, even forcing him to attend a toddlers' playgroup, to her frustration and demise. Sadly, Mrs. Tishell (Selina Cadell is perfection) appears to be the only villager who understands the Doc, aside from his Aunt, however inappropriate her genuine admiration is. His odious, greedy mother turns up, which only adds to the strain on his marriage. New baby-minder Mike is OCD and thus extremely organized, great for the Doc & baby James, but threatening to insecure, messy Louisa. She preferred the odious Mel. Eileen Atkins is marvelous as the Doc's Aunt Ruth, and the honest friendship between her and young Al Large (Joseph Absolom) is one of the better story features. Wonderfully, Martin Clunes has revealed that a 7th season is in the works, airing late 2015!",1428278400,3,1051,5.08092485549133

Its wide array of colorful characters make me laugh as, though peculiar, they demonstrate the behavior and emotions of real people in the real world.  Doc Martin's curmudgeonly personality becomes rather endearing as the series progresses and his girlfriend/wife, Louisa is beloved by all.  My husband enjoys this series as much as I do.

6017776,3,B00FPPQYXM,"I wish I could give Doc Martin season 6 more than three stars.  I re-watched it recently and found it was even worse than I remember, with Louisa scowling and snapping at Martin, and Martin looking grumpy or downright bewildered, reduced to barely mumbled responses.  What a waste of talent.  I once found this show a charming and refreshing switch from American TV, and I love all the actors (especially Clunes).  But it appears to me the writers simply don't know what to do with Martin and Louisa; and they seem strangely shy about showing the two in any reasonably intimate scenes--remember their ridiculous ""honeymoon""?  And how many medical emergencies--TWO auto mishaps, giving birth, that brain-thingy--must Louisa suffer through just so we can see the Doc demonstrate his passion for her?  I just heard there will be a season 7, and I will definitely watch, but I hope it will be much more worth my while.",1425945600,,914,4.826923076923077

We expect Doc Martin to be neurotic and difficult etc., but Louisa has suddenly become very demanding and mostly unreasonable in her own right.  For the first time I truly don't care if they stay together ... it's all become just too much work.  Hopefully series 7 will put things back on track.  I still like the show, though, I once LOVED it.",1422662400,,476,4.425287356321839

I got so interested that I forgot about time and would sit up to almost 4:00am! I think one morning it was almost 5:00am when I finally went to bed. I loved this show and wished that there was a 7th season!  Does anyone know how I could find out if there will be another season? If so please let me know. I felt so sorry for Martin, he was just so shut down that he didn't know what emotions were. He never had any love or affection from anyone but Joan and his Harpee of a mom!  Wonderful clean show! I would give it ten stars if they would let me. His mom the most selfish person I have anyone I have ever seen.  I found out that there will be season seven! YIPEEEEEEE!

6017907,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I think this is the best season yet.  I feel that Doc Martin is starting to become a little more human.  Of course, as soon as I think that something outrageous happens and he's back to being a curmudgeon.  But then, his horrendous mother appears and I think he is lucky that he turned out so ""well"".  Claire Bloom is amazing in the wicked mother role.  She was right around 80 when she played that role.  Mrs. Tishell returns and is snapping a wrist rubber band like crazy.  What a terrific actress!  She played slightly crazy so well and very crazy even better.  Burt and Al are back.  I liked Burt better as a hopeless plumber.  Pauline, the receptionist, disappeared leaving poor Al alone again.  Aunt Ruth is back and I am warming up to her, finally.  Still miss Aunt Joan.  PC Penhale is also back and as wacky as ever, but I still prefer PC Mylow.

And, of course, the Doc and Louisa are back.  You don't see that much of Louisa in some episodes, but she still suffers in a house that seems much too small for the three of them.  And, she's as adorable as ever.

Loved the school field day when Doc Martin doesn't want to waste any time doling out congratulations and awards.

It seems there is going to be a season seven!  Great!",1419120000,,1237,4.318777292576419

6017976,1,B00FPPQYXM,"The latest season of Doc Martin (okay, Season 7, minus Louisa, is currently showing in the UK) is far from the earlier episodes one came to enjoy.  DC Pennhale is now so silly he could pass for one of the Three Stooges, Bert has gained about 75 pounds, the doc himself has grown meaner and the show now seems to focus solely on Bert's son and his fascination with Moira, the doc's secretary.  In fact, the only saving grace is Louisa who maintains her character and somehow puts up with a husband who even more rude and condescending to her...at times, you want to grit your teeth and say ""get out of this marriage,"" which apparently she does in the next season.  So what happened?  It would seem that the writers have simply run out of material in this small town.  What once made the town quaint and attractive now makes the town simply boring.  The same teenage girls do nothing but roam the streets and giggle, the same pharmacy highlights the latest jars of Selsun Blue, and the same beautiful views of the Cornish coast are, well, the same ones you saw for the past five years (couldn't they at least use a few different angles?).  As for the Doc, well, there's not that much of him since his cases are now rashes and cut feet.  After all, how many people in a small town can get injured?  Sure, today's tv is intense with shows such as Breaking Bad and House of Cards; but Doc Martin used to provide a bit of relief, letting you know that you could take a breath and view a simpler more relaxing life.  Now however, that view is simply one of boredom, as if behind those cute homes the villagers are now tuning into Breaking Bad for their verification of life beyond Port Wenn.  Bring back the comedy, Doc, not the boredom.",1416355200,3,1730,4.391849529780564

6018023,3,B00FPPQYXM,"I loved this series at first. The characters were great, the acting great, and even the medicine was pretty accurate. (Except for no tourniquets used when drawing blood, and two rare diseases i one village eachepisode, alway ending in a last-minute rescue and ambulance call.)
However, as the seasons progressed, I've developed very mixed feelings. I look forward to seeing Season 6, but aproach each episode with some dread. Martin and Louisa seem always to be at odds. Can't there be some hope, more than very occasional touches of love and understanding in the relationship? It's become like a bad soap opera, predictable that they'll have several fights in each episode.

And it's not credible that Aunt Ruth, a psychiatrist, and also Lousia, a head teacher, would not know about/recognize Asperger's syndrome in this modern age. It gets tiresome that it's not addressed and wroked with, and to have his untreated Asperger's (or abusive family of origin) considered ""comedy"" is more than a bit sad.",1414540800,2,1002,5.072727272727272

I love the different actors and characters they play. I love the varied stories within the story. I wouldn't miss it for anything but an emergency. Thank you for providing us with the quality of programming that we look for and value.  I love the British channel on PBS and watch every program I can in the evening. I seldom watch anything else. And Doc Martin ranks up there with the best of them, Sherlock Holmes, Down ton Abby, and Paradise  to mention a few. They bring me comfort at the end of the day and help me forget the worries of the world.

He's arrogant and self absorbed, but this is what makes the show a scream. He lives in the nicest village on earth with the most friendliest people around. Its oil and water. Yet somehow through all this, he succeeds. He grows, in baby steps.

6018139,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I think this was a bit of a ""sleeper"" hit that will continue to be enjoyable for a long time to come.  Martin Clunes has thanked the public around the world for showing such an interest, he genuinely seems amazed.  Well, I think ""Doc Martin"" is a gift to us all.  It is a fantastic location, great acting and each episode is pretty much independent of the one before (with some exceptions).  It is just relaxing, pleasant TV with a kick of English humor.  As far as I am concerned I could easily live in Portwen and let the residents (on the TV show) entertain me for a very long while.

It has it's share of suspense, comedy and the always ongoing plot of ""The Doc"" and ""Louisa's"" relationship.  I don't mind getting 8 episodes every 2 years, it is well worth the wait (the only real problem is that they age faster than seems realistic).

Also as a side note, ""Doc Martin"" obviously has a rotten bedside manner that we have all probably encountered at one time or another yet it shows the example of a doctor doing a complete range of procedures and taking charge of patient care and follow-up with an expertise that one wouldn't expect our of a ""Rural Doctor"" or just a ""Surgeon"" in America.  It is nice to see a doctor that is competent if only on TV.",1410307200,,1255,4.329059829059829

It features multi-dimensional characters of all ages and backgrounds, who deal with personal situations that real people might confront in their own lives.

The writing is superb, the acting is excellent, and the multiple plot lines keep it interesting from beginning to end.

The supporting cast is stellar, but parts became either tired or unbelieveable to me this time around.  I think it's just that I watched these episodes one right after another.  Those who wish to enjoy this season more than I did might perhaps do better to take it in small doses spaced farther apart!",1409443200,,571,4.317757009345795

6018183,1,B00FPPQYXM,I can only reiterate what most other one-star reviewers have said.  This 6th season is a terrible letdown.  I can't believe that the writers/producers would ruin what had been a superlatively wonderful show.  The first 3 or 4 seasons were simply fantastic and we couldn't get enough of Doc Martin.  And then it headed downhill.  In the 6th season it crashed and burned.  I don't know if there is any hope of reviving this series and making it as wonderful and charming as it used to be.  Sad.,1408924800,6,492,4.5227272727272725

I only wish they filmed more frequently and that it came out in the U.S. the same time as in the UK. The show is on my local PBS station, with the same episode being aired twice a week, and I watch it twice a week! I love all the quirky inhabitants of Portwenn. The entire cast are tops in their roles. They all make this show what it is.

BUT season 5 and 6 were real disappointments; enough with the hateful Doc Martin; it's time he lightened up. I think the writers are trying to see just how mean they can make him. That is not entertaining. He was already too irritable for my taste. He said cruel things  to old people and mistreated most of his patients. We did see him have a softer side when he was with Louisa, and when she gave birth to their son, he was wonderful. So, writers, go with that. He can still be irritable to the other people, just let him be endearing when he interacts with Louisa and his son. And the pharmacist, Mrs. Tishell, had her own personality, which was quirky and interesting, but they had to go and let her go crazy. Why? It did not add to the show; in fact it was like a whole other show. Still, as long as they make the series, I will watch it if possible. I'm pretty hooked.",1408492800,,1040,4.3061224489795915

He seems incapable of feeling normal human emotion but as the series develops you build up hope for him.  In addition to Martin there are other memorable (and lovable) characters.  The series is highly addictive in the same way that MASH was so beware! In the real world I would be happy to have him as my doctor because of his skills.  Personality?

When I told him and his wife to try again, they soon found they loved the show and were addicted. All the characters in the little village are interesting.

6018328,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I watched the premiere episode (the wedding) - absolutely brilliant!  Seeing the Doc's facial muscles quiver as they struggled to hoist forth a smile (but didn't quite make it) at ""you are now man and wife"" was priceless. Expanded value on the DM traits we love: understated emotions (except for the long suffering Louisar), calamity to new heights of the imagination, absurd circumstances masterfully maneuvered via godsends of blind luck and then back to 'normal' as if nothing much to fuss about. I also watched episode 2. The new season sees interesting development of Pauline's character (Katherine Parkenson) - fantastic! Plus the perpetually itching Al Large, still itching.  The ever practical and sage Ruth Ellingham showing up at all the right moments, and baby Ellingham who seems to be already showing some physical manifestations of his DNA, yikes!  Louisar is still the weak link, with her perpetual victim posture, whining and expecting the impossible..  The couple's dynamics seem vastly unrealistic. Doc offers his heart and slowly acquired self awareness in exchange for Louisar's grating demands for total transformation.",1405987200,,1140,5.387640449438202

6018333,5,B00FPPQYXM,"If you like British humor how could you not love Doc Martin. Talk about a character. Martin Clunes is an incredible actor. His role as Doc Martin will keep you in stitches. I hope he does many, many more series.",1405728000,,211,4.3
6018334,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I started watching Doc Martin on my local PBS station and at first I didn't care for the gruff, rude, impersonal doctor. But something kept me coming back and after awhile I began to see the humor in his demeanor. The awkward love story between the Dr and ""Louiser"" also attracted me. Before long I had seen the first five seasons.
 If you are a Doc Martin fan, this season will not disappoint you. It started out a little slow, but by the end, I knew so much more about Martin as a  person and found him so much more sympathetic. He's not self -centered, just walled off as a means of self protection from his monstrous parents.  As a nurse I was amazed at how accurate much of the medical content of the series is. Eileen Atkins is wonderful as Aunt Ruth Ellingham.
The town of Port Wenn (actually the Cornwall village of Port Isaac) provides a very scenic background for this wonderful British drama/comedy. British television continues to surpass American tv in every way!!. I hope there will be a Series 7.",1405728000,,1011,4.483695652173913

6018345,3,B00FPPQYXM,"Being a bit aspy myself, with an aspy husband, I love Doc Martin, and I get it.  I'm just sick of Louisa leaving him every time you turn around.  She knew who and how he was before she married him.  She had plenty of time to think. If she wasn't up to it she shouldn't have made the commitment, and it's not like these people aren't late middle aged (old enough to know better.)  But it's only been weeks, not even years or months, and she has to take the baby, (HIS baby, too) and go ""think about it.""

 ""Why does everyone have to be happy all the time?""  Exactly.  Oh, He can't hand out sports prizes properly, I can't take it anymore.  Just stop.  As a female I'm allowed to ask: When did females turn into such wimps?

There is more and more a trend on tv for very old people to still be having teen-aged angst over relationships.  It's always ""complicated"", or they ""need space"", or they're not ready.  If you're not ready for family life by the time you're forty, then when?",1405382400,,980,4.232432432432432

6018387,3,B00FPPQYXM,"If I was asked to give a prognosis for ""Doc Martin"" in its sixth season, I would say, ""the patient is basically healthy...although perhaps as it ages, it is growing somewhat repetitive (in that Doc Martin has a conflict with someone and winds up saving their life over and over).  The one thing that I would prescribe ""amputation"" for is the character of ""PC Penhale.""  I quite simply hate the character.  He comes across as so hapless, pathetic, incompetent, and ridiculous, watching scenes with him in it where he is ""acting out"" are like fingernails on chalkboard.

This isn't the fault of the actor playing him..it's just that ""PC Penhale"" is a character who would more belong in a slapstick comedy (maybe the ""Thin Blue Line"" or something).  He doesn't belong in ""Doc Martin"" because while that show is a comedy, it's a comedy with strong dramatic elements and serious story lines (and is not too hard to believe could be a story about real life characters).

Every time Penhale bumbles onto the scene, I cringe because I know that he's going to act in a witlessly incompetent fashion.  And it beggars belief that a small town would put up with its only police officer being an ineffectual twit of such magnitude.  So if you're reading this, screenwriters, PLEASE write him out of the story and bring someone in who is more plausible (like the police officer who was in the first 15 or so episodes).",1404518400,2,1404,4.678861788617886

6018390,5,B00FPPQYXM,"The whole Doc Martin series is great! Not just one season or one show, but every show and season has drama with comedy liberally mixed in. I often laugh out loud at some of the things that come out of Doc Martin's mouth. He isn't mean, but he could sure use some sensitivity training.",1404432000,,284,4.277777777777778

We were soon addicted so we started from the beginning and watched all the way through season 5 on a streaming service.

6018398,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I don't understand why everyone who's left a negative review has written about this season being sad. It's really not. Without spoiling anything, at the end of the season we know things will work out. And as far as Doc martin being darker as the seasons go by, that's normal, a good show will have character development, just because you don't like the development of the character doesn't mean the show's awful, it means you don't like shows with authenticity. Sometimes people get worse before they get better, that's what the show displays.  it clearly states, as part of the plot, that his emotional problem with blood's worse. So obviously we'd expect the character to be in some distress and a bit ruder;",1404172800,,710,4.772357723577236
6018399,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I absolutely loved this season. Doc keeps getting nastier and nastier and I can't wait to see if and how he and Louisa work their problems out. for awhile I found myself disliking him because of his lack of compassion towards anyone, including his family.  But this season shows a break in that tough character of his.  I found myself understanding him better, and seeing some cracks in that exterior of his was intriguing.  I'm hoping that we'll see some changes in the Doc during season 7 of the series.  I find his relationship with Louisa and James Henry so interesting. I can't wait for season 7!!!!",1404172800,,604,4.616822429906542

6018409,5,B00FPPQYXM,"The taciturn, urbane London surgeon who, through an ironic onset of haemophobia, has apparently resigned himself to a self-imposed exile as a general practitioner among the rustic population of a small Cornish fishing village. The child of a very dysfunctional family, Dr. Martin Ellingham (Martin Clunes) has never learned the social skills necessary to interact with ordinary people like those he encounters on a daily basis in his general practice as the only doctor in this small, close knit community of Portwenn. Lack of a bedside manner notwithstanding, the doctor has found love, at last, in the presence of the headmistress of the local elementary school, Louisa Glasson (Caroline Catz). In the 5th season, after a brief night of unplanned passion, Louisa discovers she is with child, and in the first episode of Season 6 Martin and Louisa tie the knot, but after the birth of little James Henry. As episode follows episode in the 6th season in develops that Louisa has all the requisite maternal instincts to be a good mother but, like many women who have discovered that juggling professional career with marriage and motherhood, she finds her several roles to be very demanding. Louisa has her moments of frustration, especially with a husband who hasn't quite got the hang of marriage, let along parenthood, but they are trying to cope. Over the years some of the cast has changed and the comedic drama that is the essence of ""Doc Martin"" may have suffered just a bit in its spontaneous humor and its depth of human frailty. Nonetheless, ""Doc Martin"" continues to be a most enjoyable series. In the medium of wry, or dry humor, it is hard to find better examples than those produced for stage, screen or TV by British screen or playwrights.",1403827200,,1753,4.905723905723906
6018410,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I love the series, Doc Martin. This season is a little different than the rest. Not as quirky, more dark. Anyhow, I still love the characters and the show.",1403827200,,155,4.379310344827586

6018415,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Doc Martin is an excellent doctor in all ways except one.
 He can't stand the sight of fresh blood.
Much to his discomfort, this unmasks him as a human being.
I would pick him for my doctor in a minute because he is a human being, very
intelligent and knows his stuff backward and forward, able to grasp every medical problem in a whizz
and - most importantly - he cares deeply about all of it.
He even cares about his patients!
Marvelous actor, surrounded by other wonderful cast members. The series shines out like a lantern in the murky waters of
 other new TV shows. I wish it could go on for ever!
Where do they get these A Number One actors?
I love it!!",1403654400,,659,4.222222222222222

6018419,4,B00FPPQYXM,"We missed the show during the season, so wanted to see the big event of the wedding.  That said, the episode was not one of my favorites and seemed even more contrived and ridiculous than some of the others.  But then, I guess it wouldn't be Doc Martin if things went well,, would it?  And of course, there was the requisite medical emergency which the Doc with the help of Louisa handled brilliantly.  Sure wish we had a real Doc Martin on hand.",1403568000,,446,4.337349397590361

 you should buy",1402963200,,152,4.392857142857143
6018440,4,B00FPPQYXM,"Season 6 is a  good continuation of season 5.  However, Season 5 was never up to the standards of the earlier shows.  I have seen only 1 & 2 of Season 6 and there was some disjointedness.  Still, I will continue with the season.",1402876800,,228,4.113636363636363

6018442,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Big BBC fans. Doc Martin is not for everyone, British humor can be very subtle. Would recomend to anyone that likes a good laugh.",1402876800,,129,4.416666666666667
6018443,5,B00FPPQYXM,"This series is simply a work of art, and includes mastery in areas like cinematography and original musical score, but particularly in the effective development of the lead and supporting characters.  We have long memories at our house -- in ""Doc Martin"" we see elements of the ""Andy Griffith Show"", ""House"" and even a bit of ""Monty Python""'s British humor.  These were great TV shows -- I think the comparison to ""Andy Griffith"" is a particularly fitting tribute -- ""Andy Griffith"" included amazing development of unforgettable supporting characters, and Doc Martin is probably even better.  Can you imagine characters better than Deputy Fife or Floyd the Barber?  Try ""Doc Martin"", you may find Bert Large or PC Penhale even better!  The premise in the show is a bit like ""Green Acres"", but only in a superficial way.  A highly intelligent, well trained and accomplished city dweller moves to the country.  But ""Doc Martin"" and ""Green Acres"" quickly go their own ways once the premise is established.  ""Green Acres"" was part of the CBS wave of ""country"" situation comedies in the 1960s.  But ""Doc Martin"" is an original as far as I can see, although I don't know a lot about British TV series.

The sixth season is in keeping with the quality of the five others.  The characters continue to develop.  Doc Martin's personality has evolved over six seasons -- but all these great serials have this in common.  The writers continue to focus the characters and situations, and the result is delightful and unforgettable.

These classic episodes will grow on you with repeated watching.  Each episode is its own masterpiece -- stands on its own and fits in with the series.  Amazing!  All of this while we learn about comic life in Cornwall, and hear the British country accents.  Charming!!",1402876800,,1788,4.883720930232558

6018453,5,B00FPPQYXM,I love Doc Martin and find that the life he has is real and his character is real. We aren't all cookie cutter people and that's what make the story so good. I find that it is funny and touching and dramatic all at the same time. Bravo for not making the story line go as one would expect. It's brilliantly directed and the scenery is worth seeing. Seeing someone say exactly what he wants to say is rather refreshing as well.,1402531200,,426,4.2073170731707314

I had watched the first five seasons through three times prior to buying season six. If it were an option, I would pre-pay for season 7 (and 8, etc.) to insure that this show continues.

6018475,5,B00FPPQYXM,"It's a cute and quirky little show.

Martin Clunes does a wonderful job playing the grumpy and socially inept main character. While he is the main focus of the show, the other characters are strong enough to carry their own story lines without involvment of the main cast.

My only complaint is the length of time between seasons.  This is a British show, and their seasons are quite a bit shorter than American shows (ten or less episodes for the BBC compared to 20+ episodes for a typical American show), and they, sometimes, can put a show on hiatus for a few years before the next season begins, and you forget some of the relevant story lines in that time.

At this point, it's not clear if there will be a season 7, but I look forward to seeing Doc Martin and his neighbors if they return.",1401926400,,795,4.387755102040816
6018476,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Doc Martin could have gone the way of a comedy, but its central character is an immensely damaged, intelligent, serious man, and he could not be comic and be who he is (and yet Martin Clunes, who plays Doc Martin, is a comic actor.) With that said, there are funny characters and situations throughout the series. So you've got a lightness surrounding this main character which keeps the show feeling slightly, sometimes more than slightly, amusing. With the end of the 6th season, I am looking forward to seeing whether the doc can emerge from the emotional prison that his upbringing helped create.",1401926400,,600,4.834951456310679

6018483,4,B00FPPQYXM,"Season 6 was a pleasant surprise when compared to season 5. Last season was somewhat of a disappointment in that he seemed to become more determined to become less human. There was also little  development and the loss of a key character ,shortcomings that were somewhat corrected this season.

6018490,5,B00FPPQYXM,Um....who doesn't love Doc Martin???? I love this series and am so glad to have this. The characters are all so loveable which explains why this show is so addicting.,1401667200,,166,4.566666666666666
6018491,4,B00FPPQYXM,"Between Hulu and Amazon, I have watched the full 6 seasons of the Doc Martin TV series over the course of the last 4 months.
After 6 seasons I do find myself wondering if I even want Doc Martin to grow and change out of what has made him so successful as a doctor and a failure as a father and husband.  The pursuit of impersonal perfection that drove him to be the doctor you want to have at your side in a medical crisis is admirable.  But in writing this character this way, as an intelligent and driven individual, how can it be that he reaches this state of life apparently devoid of compassion for not only his fellow man but for his own newly found family?  In that sense it seems somewhat contrived that he cannot open up more to the beautiful Louisa considering the trauma they have already undergone.
Were it not for the robust characters that flesh out the environment of Port Wenn, enduring Doc Martin's lack of even desire to change, yet alone any actual deed, I would have turned off after the 3rd season.  But the cast of supporting characters from the Doc's Aunts, to his receptionists, to Al and Bert, and the two constables they've gone through, let alone Mrs. Tishell, have kept it interesting.
So I find myself almost addicted to things like what kind of ridiculous behavior will the Penhale the PC display in this episode.  Will Mrs. Tishell relapse into her previous obsession, will Louisa continue to put up with Doc Martin's clinicality in all matters public and private, will Al and Morwenna ever work it out or will Morwenna be gone in the next season as part of the revolving door of receptionists?
I find some British series, particularly their character studies like this show, to be repetitive in social theme as though intended to portray the stability of English society against all odds as a mark of superior civilization despite the low comedy in a lot of them.  In that sense Doc Martin continues this trend - but if that observation is true then why do I keep coming back for more?
I don't really have an answer, but I keep coming back.
Season 7 will be the make or break for me.  Either Doc Martin learns to be likeable in some way, at least to Louisa, and compassionate for his patients in some small ways or he's basically a lost cause after 6 years.
I had the opportunity to see an interview on the web with Martin Clunes which brought home to me how well he carries this part.  In the interview he appeared to be a polar opposite in personality to the character he plays.  He was outgoing, jocular, and enthusiastic.  Had I not watched that interview following Season 5 I might not have watched Season 6 because of how relentlessly unchanging the character was portrayed.  But knowing that Martin Clunes as an actor is playing a part quite different than himself means to me that if the writiers elect to grow Doc Martin then the actor will be able to carry it off by being more of himself in the part.",1401667200,4,2943,4.472014925373134
6018492,5,B00FPPQYXM,Classic.  Well developed relationships.  Sight gags didn't detract from story.  Couple maturing with time.  Hoping for more of the same quality.,1401667200,,144,5.714285714285714
6018493,5,B00FPPQYXM,Season 6 doesn't disappoint.  I love this series and love Cornwall.  I must admit though I keep waiting for Dr. Elingham to become a much nicer guy.  I'm sure since Louisa left him it's coming.,1401667200,,193,4.457142857142857

I have the feeling the powers that be don't want the show to continue. Best way to do that is to turn off the viewers. As if having to wait two years for the next series isn't bad enough.

Doc Martin is such a misfit in society but he has an abiding love for his profession and dolts on being perfect to the benefit of his patients even if they don't quite get his personality.  We can hardly not like him even when he is being just plain stupid, but funny at the same time, with his social skills which he has very few of but deep in his core he wishes he could be liked and learn to like other people too but people perplex this brilliant man with the short temper and quirky ways - he keeps trying though to figure it all out.  After you meet his mother in one of the episodes you start to get a picture of how Doc Martin evolved into who he is.

6018528,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys English comedy/drama.  However, it is best to watch Series 1 to 5 to understand the entire story.  It's my favorite English program - a doctor with no sense of humor and a sour personality, once you see it from the beginning, then you'll understand why.  Although he is unusual, he is really funny.  There is no other show like it.  It gets better as time goes on.",1400716800,,408,4.386666666666667

Thankfully we have Amazon streaming and so for $1.99 we were able to see the conclusion as soon as we found out we missed the last 15 minutes. As for the show it is a really interesting, funny ( in a British way ) and several wonderful character studies. Highly recommend it.",1400544000,,444,4.235294117647059

6018541,3,B00FPPQYXM,This series made Louisa (now Doc Martins wife) a domineering shrew. Her behavior was a complete turn off and spoiled the series for me.,1400371200,,135,4.666666666666667

I watched her in another show, Murder in Suburbia, and thought she was great there as well.  Both of the receptionists are so quirky.  I will watch Doc Martin until they end the series; then I'll probably repeat them on my own!",1400198400,2,400,4.410958904109589
6018547,5,B00FPPQYXM,Doc Martin is one of the classic British comedies.  Series six completed my collection of the two movies and series one through five. Quality is excellent.

6018550,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Doc Martin is a gem. American TV tends to glamorize sex, drugs, and alcohol this show does not. The characters in this show are ordinary people with ordinary problems. Set in a small village in Cornwall, England where every body knows everybody, the stories are generally upbeat and heartwarming. Don't be surprised if you find yourself laughing out loud.",1400112000,,355,5.033898305084746
6018551,5,B00FPPQYXM,We love this series.  The season is too short!  It is easy to order through Amazon.  Thank you for asking.,1400112000,,106,4.2
6018552,3,B00FPPQYXM,"I started watching the Doc Martin series on Netflix (2-5) out of curiosity and quickly became addicted.
I loved the way the Doc's face showed his real emotion despite his harsh words and generally bad attitude.  The beautiful little town, the scenery and the quirky characters keep you wondering what would come next.  Do not judge the whole series based on this season!!
  Had to buy this Season 6 just to continue watching as it isn't available anywhere else but ended up very disappointed by it.  It is very dark and the emotion from the Doc that you saw in the previous seasons seems to be missing.
There is no romance or kind words between his long suffering wife and him and the last episode does not hold out any hope for them fixing their marriage.  I know that they are filming Season 7 and that it will be release in 2015 and I hope the producers can fix what they broke in Season 6!",1400112000,2,893,4.381818181818182

6018555,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Before purchasing something like this, I generally read 5-10 5-star reviews and a similar amount of the 1 or 2-star reviews.  I've read the reviews and I don't understand the negative ones.  Season 6 seems to me to be in the normal progression of a sit com.  It's funny, engaging and entertaining. Now, I don't have any fantasized relationship with the characters in the show.  I don't ""know"" them.  I don't expect anything from them except to entertain me for one episode at a time.  I'm not a literary critic.  The ""progression"" of the characters may not be ""intrinsically consistent"" but I don't care about such things when I'm watching a sit-com.  It's entertaining.  If I ever met a character like those in the show, I probably wouldn't be friends with them.  But I like watching the show.  Some of the other reviews made me concerned about the quality of the DVD's.  Those concerns were unfounded.  The DVD quality is great.  I don't know what other people were expecting (maybe it's not HD) but there was nothing to distract me from enjoying the show.  It looks like the episodes I have watched on the BBC channel on my Time Warner cable.  I recommend the product.",1400025600,,1171,4.639024390243902

6018557,5,B00FPPQYXM,"My husband and I just recently found ""Doc Martin"" on the PBS channel and we were hooked.  We ordered the early seasons so we could know who's who and why in the upcoming episodes.  It is a show that encompasses some of the beautiful southwest coastal topography and the quirky nature of small town 'anywhere' England.  The character studies and the humor and occasional pathos of the pompous, insensitive, yet somehow lovable Doc Martin draw us in episode after episode.  Now that we have finished watching all five seasons we are wrapping it up and sending it on to my son and daughter-in-law for their enjoyment.",1400025600,,614,4.764150943396227

6018559,3,B00FPPQYXM,"I've really enjoyed DM series.  I've watch ALL the episodes many times each.  But, I marvel at how the doc's character just refuses to grow up!  This 6th. season is much worse than any of the others.  The other reviews have pointed out that the doc is just SO bad.
Well, of course he is.  1st.  The doc needs to get some serious mental help!  2nd.  Doc's married and has no idea how to be a good husband.  He's of course has never had any role modeling.  3rd.  His wife, is out of sorts because she won't cut the doc any slack; she seems to expect him to stand up and fly-right just because they're married and have  a kid.  Neither of the people have a clue on how to care for a baby.  Neither wish to give up jobs to care for a life they brought into the world because they were stupid.  Both characters think the other should be doing better... even though the doc gives a good impression that he really doesn't care. 4th.  The little Mrs. Doc decides it's all too tough so shucks, guess I'll just have to get away from it all.  Just have to have some time away from the Doc.  5th.  NO ONE IS MAKING ANY EFFORT TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE OTHER!!!  NO ONE TRIES TO SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS, LIKE ADULTS, WHAT ARE NEEDS, HOPES, DESIRES, FEARS, EXPECTATIONS, ETC...
But, I guess if the characters did that, there would be no show. If you leave the comedy behind then try to get some meat into what's going on.

And then there is the chemist.  She used to be my favorite character.  She was really funny.  Now, she's just a worn-out poor, broken-hearted , mis-understood used-up lady.

It's a good show, but not nearly as good as the first 5.  I get the feeling that they are running short of material so have resorted to leave the comedy and go for the dysfunctional foibles of the cast/characters.",1399939200,,1791,4.271641791044776
6018560,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I fell in love with this show months ago and had to order all the seasons.  A sleepy little seaside village of Port Wenn with idiosyncratic characters makes it so very different from other shows.  The characters and their predicaments are hilarious, heartwarming, and realistic.  The viewers escape into brilliant writing and production.

Despite his brusque exterior is a man of depth and brilliance.  Doc Martin leaves the audience spellbound once again with his portrayal of a gifted physician who just can seem to get love, even when it is staring him in the face, right.  It leaves the audience keeping hope alive for both Martin and Louisa, whose love is interwoven with dysfunctional parents, a need to be loved and understood, and an undeniable chemistry.  Will their love survive this round?  Will Martin grow to be the man Louisa so desperately needs?  I'll definitely be waiting.....",1399852800,,894,5.0272108843537415

Of course not this much quirky behaving people can possibly be in one small town, but, oh well, they have to keep writing the series. While this does not get our ""excellent"" rating, it is close to it. And, as we always make note, it makes you wonder why on earth the junk on US TV cannot do better. Those shows don't approach some of the good series in the UK.",1399075200,,473,4.096774193548387

6018594,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I hesitated in buying series 6 after reading some mixed reviews, but finally pulled the trigger.  I'm glade I did. Series 6 falls right in line with series 1-5, and I found it very entertaining just as the first 5 were. I think people need to remember that Doc Martin's humer is not terribly silly, mostly, and not slapstick. It's humor is more suttle and even a bit dry. But in it's way, very funny. So as for series 6, go for it, especially if you liked the previous series.",1399075200,,476,4.288888888888889
6018595,5,B00FPPQYXM,My least favorite season. They could do SO much toward helping us understand Doc and also create funny situations with the community that the fans would NEVER tire of but this season was too dark. Not to say I don't watch them over and over because I really love this show but this season does not leave me feeling as happy and comfortable as the other seasons. One truly bright note is the relationship between Al and Aunt Ruth. Its WONDERFUL and I beg the powers that be to elaborate on that lovely friendship. Its a relationship you never see portrayed on TV or in film..in fact you rarely see it in real life either. A younger man who has a proper platonic love and respect for an older woman and vice versa. Its the highlight of this season in particular. Both of these actors are just superb. I'm hoping that season 7 will have more of the comedy than the drama for Martin and Louisa.,1398988800,,890,4.367469879518072
6018596,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Doc Martin never fails to be a wonderful show! He has begun to ""think""
about his responses to his wife and baby and seems to
be more caring of their feelings. I love all the characters.
I will watch this series over and over--it's like Frasier, you
always laugh and see people you have known in the cast of characters!!!
I hope it continues for many more seasons.",1398988800,2,363,4.352941176470588

6018598,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I've bought Seasons 1 through 5 of the ""Doc Martin"" series and watch it on Channel 2 every Wednesday night.  Doc Martin is very gruff and does not suffer fools gladly.  I was so happy when Season 6 finally came out!
Even though Doc Martin is a bit of a lost soul, he really grows on you.  I look forward to seeing what's new with the people in the little Cornish village of Port Wenn every week.  It's really the town of Port Isaac and it makes you want to go there and spend some time there, to relax and look out at the vast ocean and the beautiful scenery.  Just when you think you know what's going to happen, you often get a surprise.  The characters are quirky and you feel like they're friends of yours.  This is an excellent series!  I hope it continues for many years to come.

All the other characters are brilliant as well,  but my three other favorite characters, which I feel really also carry the show, are his aunt Ruth, Mrs. Tishell, and PC Penhale.  In fact, I wish they had bigger roles in the show, but all of the characters are necessary to this great show.",1398556800,,454,4.5
6018620,1,B00FPPQYXM,"Doc M was our favorite series ever. We watched every episode 10-15 times. Bought advance vdeo of season 6, and were extremely disapponted - extremely! It's a pathetic failure. I would never recommend season 6. Very sad. I guess the hip writers got too fat and lazy. How they could sacrifice such a profitable franchise . . .",1398470400,2,324,4.603448275862069

6018622,3,B00FPPQYXM,"If the doc continues this sad storyline I don't think I will be able to stay with him. He acts too aweful, looks too aweful, obviously feels awefully aweful too. Currently here is little comedy in this comedy. The rest of the cast is doing it's best but they can't do so much without Martin. I can only hope he's begun a healing process.
""Your childhood traumas have followed you way too long Dr. Ellingham. You have finally stood up to your miserable mother, thank God! Quirky and eccentric are one thing, NUTS is another.

6018638,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I've now watched seasons 1 through 5 over again from the beginning and just finished with season 6 which aired last year.  What a treasure.  Martin Clunes is simply superb as the angry short tempered and eternally  frustrated GP in this small English coastal town filled with maddening and hilariously obstinate and quirky characters.  But then so is everybody in the cast here, including Caroline Catz who is the charming and attractive female lead.  The fictional village of Portwenn (beautiful St. Isaac in Cornwall)  is a real character in the ongoing drama with its winding streets, and views of the blue sea ---  and the unique  Ian McNeice is especially captivating as Bert Large, a lovable though fallible pillar of the community.  Stephanie Cole as Doc Martin's Aunty June is unforgettable  and so is Eileen Atkins as yet another loving and interesting aunt.  Claire Bloom does a great job now and then as Martin's ghastly mother.  But I love all the cast truly.  If you haven't tried this series, it's a pleasure to marathon it, let me assure you. There's something safe and comforting about it, though it is always surprising and entertaining.  And I so hope we will see a season 7.  We must have a season 7!!!!  Makes me want to get on a plane for Port Isaac and rent a little house overlooking the bay, and never return to the real world.",1398124800,25,1351,4.685106382978724

6018640,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Addicted to Doc Martin, but as these series progress, the character becomes more and more unlovable, until now he's gone from amusingly, innocently blunt (My favorite scene  ""Can I stop you right there?"" ) to simply deliberately unkind & offensive.

6018654,5,B00FPPQYXM,Thoroughly enjoyed the  Doc Martin Season 6 presentation.  It showed a sobering trend for the show;  less comedy and more real life experience.  I still enjoyed (anticipated)  PC Penhale's hanging on the barn hook but found a much more serious nature of the show.  Brilliant acting by the entire cast;  each role is perfectly filled..Looking forward to the next continuation.  JM,1397865600,,379,5.098360655737705

6018657,5,B00FPPQYXM,"The video is great and well worth the price, but I must admit to being upset with the process.  I was searching around on the Amazon Instant Video Web site and wanted to find out what the the price would be and how to download it when I was shocked to find out that I had purchased the HD with a ""One Click"" feature I had not signed up for.

I now have the Doc Martin Season 6 downloaded to my iPad and I can't return it nor could I stop the purchase once I had clicked the wrong button on the Instant Video site.  I thought the purchase would be similar to any on Amazon.com where I would be asked for some payment details and a chance to order the thing from my 'cart'.  It didn't work that way. Since I had never signed up for the 'One Click Purchase' option on Amazon.com I was really surprised that I had ordered the download while trying to get more information.

I suppose I am at fault for not figuring out how that purchase site worked.  Beware of that One Click purchase feature.  My mistake cost me about twenty dollars.  Frankly, I feel just a bit ""taken"" in this situation even though I probably should have known how the download Instant Video process worked.  I can only conclude that buying from the Instant Video site is REALLY instant and I will be very careful if there is a next time.

I just have to remember all purchases on the Instant Video site are made instantly as soon as the BUY button is clicked or tapped.",1397779200,2,1436,4.208029197080292
6018658,3,B00FPPQYXM,"The series was wonderful, season 6, not so much. Doc Martin's charm was that his awkward social skills did not match his depth of feeling. In the last season he became more ridged, and less loveable. It seemed as if they just wanted to abruptly tie up the series and move along. (Hint) Maybe they can add a season 7 to make us feel better? A happy ending opposed to an abrupt ending would have been nice.",1397779200,4,404,4.259740259740259

It is quick, never a dull moment in good old Portwenn...I absolutely love it all. I cannot wait to see next episode. You just have to love him...but then he does something stupid..and poor Louisa has to learn all of his quirks..But when his son looked at him and smiled, I almost wanted to cry knowing that his father never had the love and attention that he is getting..: (  Absolutely recommend it to anyone..",1397606400,,536,4.254901960784314
6018669,4,B00FPPQYXM,"Can't ANYTHING go right for this guy?  I've watched every season of Doc Martin, but this year I'm less sympathetic to his
complete lack of social skills AND his desire to acquire any.  His poor wife will tire of the effort it will take to remain in that marriage
and love a man that may be brilliant, but is so badly damaged.  She is pouring herself into a black hole that will never be filled.
I'm not sure I can continue watching this train wreck...I feel deeply sorry for Louisa who is representative of so many women in
relationships with others that simply can't or won't give what is needed.",1397606400,,597,4.409090909090909

6018671,5,B00FPPQYXM,"It really is addictive. Every time I re-watch an episode I catch things in the background and still laugh at all the stupid things Dr. Ellingham just can't fathom. I've even thought of visiting ""Portwenn"" for season 7 filming. a must have if you also buy the 1-6 plus two movie set.",1397520000,,282,4.4423076923076925

6018673,4,B00FPPQYXM,"I began watching 'Doc Martin' on PBS before I moved to San Carlos and then realized I could get Series 1-5 on Hulu on my laptop. With every episode I enjoyed the story more and more, and was aware Season 6 would come out in 2014. Knowing that the story wasn't over I have waited anxiously and as time went on I had no access to it until I saw it on Amazon. Now that I've watched it, I'm sure the story isn't over so here I am, waiting for Series 7. Just what has been causing the Doc's blood phobia, and has Louisa run out of patience to love this seemingly unlovable, sometimes intolerable complex man? And will Martin ever truly learn to be a better husband as he promises? I'm hoping the saga will continue because  my questions aside, the 'Doc Martin' episodes have colorful and entertaining characters I'll enjoy forever.",1397433600,,826,4.398692810457517

6018683,5,B00FPPQYXM,Well worth the wait.  So disappointing that he is still unable to mellow a little.  I feel the grumpiness is overdone.  There were earlier scenes when he smiled a little as when Roger Fenn was in hospital and he told him about his phobia.  Looking forward to series 7 when hopefully with Louisa's help he learns how to be a husband and father.,1397260800,,343,4.396825396825397
6018684,4,B00FPPQYXM,"This whole series is funny without trying to be.  The actors, direction, scenes are all well done!  Series 6 is a little darker and not quite as funny and this may be because we are very familiar with most of the characters.  IMHO one of the best comedy/dramas of all time.",1397260800,,273,4.313725490196078

6018688,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Can only say that when this series is over, it will a sad, sad day in television history. This series has been one of the most engaging, humorous, enjoyable shows that we have ever watched.

6018690,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I stumbled upon the first season before it aired in the USA on PBS.  I fell in love with the picturesque fishing village and the quirky locals. Doc Martin is a cranky thing that is truly trying to be a decent, caring husband and father; so naturally, I fell in love with his character all over again in this season. This series continues to be a quirky, clever and moving show that I will re-watch  time and time again.",1397088000,,419,4.291139240506329
6018691,5,B00FPPQYXM,"My wife and I have watched all the seasons of Doc Martin and have thoroughly enjoy it. It's quirky and off-beat and is a refreshing change from the run-of-the-mill programming that profliferates other channels.

6018701,5,B00FPPQYXM,"My wife is absolutely addicted to Doc Martin. So, in order to keep peace I have taken to watching the episodes with her and find myself caught up in the character development and anticipating what will happen next. Now that we have come to the end of season six, I find we are both anxious to find out what will happen all the way around. There are too many loose ends to not come back for another season and tie it all up with a great big ribbon of finality. It has been an extraordinary experience watching Martin Clunes, whom we just watched in a documentary about dogs, morph into the character of Doc Martin. Really amazing acting all the way around. If this is the final season, thank you all for a wonderful ride. If not, we'll be cued up for the next series of adventures in Cornwall.",1396915200,3,792,4.322147651006712

6018705,5,B00FPPQYXM,I enjoyed it very much. It is funny and it keeps me awake while watching.  It is a family movie. It doesn't use profane words. A lot of action. The movie is addictive. Different and plenty of humor. I chose five stars because it is a great series!,1396828800,,247,4.145833333333333

6018708,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I am a long-time fan of Doc Martin. It was great to watch all of Season 6 at one time, because I have missed some segments. I had heard some disparaging reviews about this season, stating that the Doc remains as sour as ever, even after marrying Louisa. However, I found that there were changes that moved the series forward in terms of relationships and story line. I just wish we didn't have to wait so long gor season 7.",1396828800,,423,4.3
6018709,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Love this series and somehow I missed all of season 6.  I have my DVR set but it didn't pick it up.

6018710,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Doc Martin is so different from other shows, it's like having fresh mango sorbet after a heavy pasta meal.  Love the scenery, the characters, and the town.  The evolution of Doc Martin's character from an almost autistic persona to struggling to connect with Louisa is brilliant.",1396828800,,279,5.043478260869565
6018711,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I just couldn't wait for season 6 to come to our local public television station. I watched the whole season as soon as I got it, and was very happy I did. If you aren't a Doc Martin fan, you will become one if you watch. I just recommend starting with season one so you don't miss the developing relationships with the interesting town characters.",1396828800,,348,4.369230769230769

6018713,5,B00FPPQYXM,I didn't realize Season 6 was out.  Was happily surprised to stumble upon it on NHPR.  Now I have to catch up with the first six of 2013 that I missed.  Hilarious.,1396828800,,163,4.03125
6018714,2,B00FPPQYXM,"Martin Clunes has said they would quit when they had run out of NEW ideas, well that time has come.  They will spoil it if they do another series, they have run out of ideas, everything is painfully slow and exaggerated.",1396742400,3,220,4.365853658536586
6018715,3,B00FPPQYXM,"I didn't care for the first episode, because the scenes of the blood were over the top, for this kind of show. Really, the script made little sense, either.",1396742400,,156,4.413793103448276
6018716,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I know it is controversial, but Martin displays many of the characteristics of a man with Asperger's syndrome.  Many with the syndrome are brilliant, but they are ""mindblind"" in that they cannot put themselves in another's shoes, and thus don't anticipate how their words will ""feel"" to others.  They have very deep feelings themselves, but can't express them.  They have one or just a couple of obsessions that make them experts and these obsessions are relaxing to them (solving medical problems and working on clocks in Martin's case.)  They tend to be honest, well-meaning people who speak their mind and offend the heck out of others unknowningly.  Louisa has no idea of what causes Martin to behave the way he does, but she suspects that he truly is well intentioned.  Social situations, sensory overload (noise, smells, etc.) cause those with Asperger's to shy away from social situations.  They are draining for those with the condition.  The love story between Martin and Louisa mirrors the love and frustrations of many thousands of relationships between those with undiagnosed Asperger's and a person who is neurologically typical (NT) like Louisa.  The lack of emotional connection for Louisa, and the constant noise, lack of alone time, and emotional demands of living with an NT (Martin) are tearing at seams of a love relationship that is real but which cannot mesh.

(And yeah, I know that some think that Martin is the way he is because his mom was cold and crazy, and his dad abandoned him.  Nah.  That was not pleasant or helpful to him, but he was raised by his wonderful Auntie Joan.  His quirky (and grumpy) personality comes from a portrayal of rare neurological issues.)

The show initially did not present Martin in the description above.  He was originally meant to be a very professional man, somewhat floundering and clueless, in a small, provincial town.  Clunes took the character elsewhere starting in the 2nd or 3rd season (I can't remember) and molded Martin into the beloved character that we all enjoy watching.

I love the show!",1396742400,9,2064,4.953488372093023

I personally think that they should have stopped after Series 5 but their decision to continue is a big disaster.  The first episode was horrible (brainless) and the rest is a futile attempt at finding or building a plot where there is no material.  Every episode is worse than the next to follow.  Only the one where they bring his mother back is worth watching and I truly feel sorry about it because as I said before I was a big fan of the show and at times even obsessed with it.  By the way, I think it is time to retire Burt.",1396310400,3,636,4.056

Dr. Martin is so completely rude, nasty, unfeeling, harsh, insulting, etc., etc., that it becomes ""not funny"" in my opinion.  But he so ghastly that every now and then I break down and watch a few episodes to see how he's getting along (and he's always just as horrible as ever).  I bought the wedding episode from season six to see if they actually got married this time and it was actually funny in spots and was also the first time I ever saw any glimmer of tenderness in his interaction with Louisa.  Maybe he'll become a slightly less obnoxious person but I sort of doubt it...",1396310400,,636,4.410256410256411

6018743,5,B00FPPQYXM,"One of my favorite shows. I enjoyed this season and look forward to the next season of Doc Martin and his lovable and irritating ways.

6018744,5,B00FPPQYXM,"This series has remained consistently excellent for six seasons. The Brits definitely have a handle on TV comedy. In addition to witnessing the strengths and weaknesses of the two main characters, we look forward to watching the foibles of the dumb cop, the crusty restauranteur, the endless stream of ditsy receptionists, the picturesque beauty of a Wales fishing village and it it's quaint residents. Much as we'd like to see it go on forever, that just doesn't happen. Sooner or later every great television show runs out of steam or quits before it does. Never a question of if but rather when. I will stay tuned until that decision is made.",1396224000,,645,4.81981981981982

6018755,2,B00FPPQYXM,"We waited what - 2 years? - for the new series, but the first episode was a huge disappointment.  The long-awaited wedding was over in a few minutes and the honeymoon was just frustrating, tedious, and aggravating.  Did they get new writers who had no experience with comedy? Nothing funny about Louisa wandering around in the dark and muddy woods in her wedding dress.  Episode 2 was a little better, but where is the lighthearted humor we enjoyed for five seasons - for free with Prime?  Not worth the per-episode price - we'll wait until it's on Prime or PBS to watch the rest of series 6.",1395964800,5,592,4.5046728971962615

6018759,5,B00FPPQYXM,"This intelligent British series has charmed me with it's tongue in cheek sense of humor and amazing village atmosphere. It is almost as much about the Cornish coast as it is the grouchy doctor and his colorful cast of patients. Martin Clunes is well known as a comedic actor but he brilliantly portrays this uncomfortable, grouchy, and somewhat sad medical genius who finds work as a general practitioner in a beautiful but tiny seaside village after his blood phobia causes him to end his career as a surgeon in London. All the characters involved are so well developed and the cast includes some legendary actors in British television.
 I wish that American television could be this thoughtful and smart.",1395964800,,706,4.932773109243698

We can't wait to see what happens to Doc and everyone in the sleepy little village.  Wish we were there right now!  This is truly a delightful series and well worth our time watching.  I know we will watch the whole series over and over again.,1395878400,,346,4.276923076923077

The video that I bought from Amazon Instant Video, which, by the way, came in handy at just the right time when we had company, was a great FIND.  Season 6 Episode 1 is exceptionally entertaining.  It has drama, suspense, comedy and heart.  We loved it.",1395878400,,391,4.375
6018763,5,B00FPPQYXM,I don't know how anyone so antisocial can be so darned fun to watch but this has become one of our favorite programs.  All the characters fit in so well and the scenery is wonderful.  Makes us want to just pick up and go to Port Wenn...  And being able to watch the 'behind the scenes' clips helps so much.  We can see for ourselves that Martin isn't the ogre he portrays on screen.  Somehow that makes me feel better.,1395878400,,418,4.175

6018766,5,B00FPPQYXM,"This show does such a wonderful job of character development of unlikable people.  It is impossible not to develop compassion when you learn about why such unsavory characters are suffering, including Doc Martin!",1395705600,,212,5.424242424242424
6018767,2,B00FPPQYXM,"Spoiler Alert.

I must agree with everything the 1- and 2-star reviewers said.  The series just felt totally flat .  Not simply the writing or the acting or the downer of all the storylines (except for Bert's successful romance), but it did not have the same verve and liveliness of past shows.  It felt ""off.""

Last season, Doc was really unkind to Louisa.  I didn't have too much sympathy this season b/c didn't she know by now what was getting into?  But, like many an ill-fated love affair, I guess they have to run the thing into the ground to finally let it go.  (Not that I'm convinced that this is the last season.)  Now, Doc and Louisa just seem like crabby roommates.  She looks worn out by him, and she's not as buoyant as she used to be.  Of course, I don't blame her.  It's painful to watch them interact.

In addition, so much of this series was total retread.  Everything's happened before!  Louisa's gotten fed up before.  Doc's gotten all gloomy and spaced-out before when she leaves.  Doc's come back on his knees.  Louisa's taken him back.  Plots like P.C. Penhale getting into trouble on his ""wilderness"" trek more or less happened before with P.C. Mark Mylow back when he got the snake bite.  We had an OCD person before (that young schoolteacher)--although I did like Mike, the nanny--a fresh face, a smile whenever you'd see him (despite his troubles).  We already had a couple of close-calls with crazy people when Doc gallantly saved the day--though when he was rescuing his Aunt Ruth from the stalker, there was no suspense at all.  His really awful mother stopped by earlier for a first round of humiliation and for us to get hit over the head with ""why he turned out the way he did.""

I agree with the 1-star reviewer who said that these character need to change somehow, grow.

All that said, however, I did more or less binge-watch it over the course of a few days, even with a little anticipation, just coz I got into the Portwenn state of mind.  And of course I will watch any future series, too.",1395705600,7,2028,4.5054945054945055

6018777,5,B00FPPQYXM,Doc Martin is addicting. So well done that's maybe why only 6 or 8 episodes are produced at a time. Can't believe how many days that translates until Season 7 is available. Rates right up there with the classics from the UK.,1395532800,,224,4.357142857142857

6018784,4,B00FPPQYXM,"There are painful moments, and episodes where we wish the writers would allow a bit more humanity to the old Doc, but we have enjoyed it immensely so far; the townsfolk are nutty as can be, the medical aspect is interesting sometimes, and Louiser and the Doc are a constant source of tension surrounding a love of a strange sort. I thought this would be the series in which we would find the Doc thawing and becoming more human and able to understand Louisa and their baby but the writers have opted to keep his non-ability to understand all others at a high pitch. That's the humor but he began the series less anti-social than he has become. Something has to humanize him and if not a wife he loves (in his sort of way) and a young son, then what? I think keeping up his anti-social behavior in the world- at- large and becoming more understanding and mellow at home might be a better way to carry on. Then this thawing can grow slowly to encompass the bigger world and he can become a better man although probably never a completely social one. If he remains static then divorce will be the only option and that would kill the series for me.",1395360000,,1144,4.375586854460094

6018788,5,B00FPPQYXM,Tragically this is the latest season - we will have to wait for what will seem like a lifetime for the next series.

6018789,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I love Doc Martin, and even though some of the quirky characters have come and gone--they have been replaced by very competent and equally quirky, however different, characters over the years. I do not care if there is a year break in between seasons, just so long the Doc comes back.....Season 6 will not disappoint, perhaps as some reviewers has mentioned, it is not the same as the prior ones--the writing has matured and the characters are growing and changing, but a true fan will appreciate the growth and just love seeing them (and the beautiful surroundings) all again and again ~ Long live Doc Martin....",1395273600,,613,4.7924528301886795

6018791,3,B00FPPQYXM,"As a fan of Doc Martin, I just had to see it, but I have to say that this season fell flat.  There was no character development of the doc, his girl or their relationship.

6018802,3,B00FPPQYXM,"Season 6 of Doc Martin was rather disappointing to me. I thought that after the Doc and Louisa got married he would be a bit more communicative with her as well as kinder and gentler. But rather the opposite was true. By the end of the season, Louisa is ready to leave him and I don't blame her! Martin is slowly coming to the realization that he needs to change to keep Louisa, but the question is......CAN HE? I certainly hope that IF there is a Season 7 we will see Doc Martin showing some improvement in his interpersonal skills with Louisa and all the folks of PortWenn!",1395187200,,575,4.333333333333333

6018817,3,B00FPPQYXM,"I would guess I am not the only dyed-in-the-wool fan of Doc M. that might say/write this: season 6 is very disappointing. I would also guess that others have said this: there was MUCH TOO MUCH jammed into the first episode!! I don't even want to take the time to watch the second episode. Oh, dear. I NEVER thought I would write/say that about one of my used-to-be-absolute-favorite shows. Too bad.",1395014400,,398,4.619718309859155
6018818,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I really enjoyed this series and hope it has more to come. I have had doctors like him in my life and so I know they do exist, without the humor of course. Plus, we know for sure that we have had characters like these in our lives as well. All I can say is that I would miss him if he wasn't around to make me laugh my way to wellness...",1395014400,,337,3.6944444444444446
6018819,5,B00FPPQYXM,Once you start you can't stop. Characters are wonderful and believable. Love the dry British humor. Hope they bring back for one more season.,1395014400,,141,4.916666666666667

6018823,5,B00FPPQYXM,"We discovered Doc Martin a couple of years ago and have watched all the past seasons on Roku through Amazon Prime.  Love the series - the setting, writing, the actors are wonderful.  Would love to go to Port Isaac someday!",1394928000,,222,4.525
6018824,5,B00FPPQYXM,"The generation of three or four ""situations"" and usually a happy solution for most reminds me of the Northern Exposure format.
The Doc Martin character is much better than Joel was and the acting and locations are just about as good. Most people should have a good feeling at each chapters ending.",1394928000,,297,4.730769230769231
6018825,5,B00FPPQYXM,This series continues to be funny and heart warming.  Keep hoping that Doc will soften up a bit for Lousa's sake!  He shows signs!,1394928000,,130,4.375
6018826,3,B00FPPQYXM,"I truly love this series. I was hooked the very first episode.  But after watching series six I was disappointed.  I felt they made Martin just a little to much.  The school scence where Martin was giving out awards was over the top.  It just about ruined it for me.  I will probably watch series 7 if they have one, but with not as much enthusiasm as before

6018828,5,B00FPPQYXM,"This quirky, dedicated doctor has entertained my husband and myself for many seasons.  Season 6 does not disappoint, with the real wedding finally taking place.  We love the scenery, the hills and dales, as much as we have come to love the characters.  The quality of the actors' performances is exceeded only by that of the writing, and the acting is superb.",1394841600,,359,4.758064516129032
6018829,5,B00FPPQYXM,A great combination of humor and serious story lines.  I hope they plan on a season7 become they really left us hanging on what will become of many relationships.,1394841600,,162,4.586206896551724
6018830,5,B00FPPQYXM,This series continues on our local PBS channel and I purchased this series 6 from my brother as a Christmas present.  He and I both enjoy watching the situations Doc Martin gets himself into and the actors and actresses are all first class.  Good British humor with a stiff upper lip,1394841600,,283,4.529411764705882

6018835,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Although, in my opinion, the season opener was a bit silly, the season as a whole was engaging. Greater depth of characters....loved seeing ""Auntie Ruth"" developed more. And may we please see a Season 7?",1394755200,,203,4.828571428571428
6018836,5,B00FPPQYXM,"For years we have enjoyed the antics of the various inhabitants of Portwenn, esp Martin.  I was worried that parenting and marriage would somehow take away from the humor and human pathos of this remarkable comedy.  But watching Martin & Louisa stumble along makes our own attempts look like huge successes.",1394668800,,307,5.0
6018837,2,B00FPPQYXM,"The instant video kept stopping and starting--called customer service and the technician was very helpful, but unable to tell me how to improve the site.

6018838,1,B00FPPQYXM,"Wow--watching Season 6 was painful. There are few rewards and little humor. The Doc regresses to a more miserable and introverted state of mind than ever, and of course, the relationship between him and Louisa suffers to the breaking point and beyond. I kept watching in hope for a little reward in the final episode, but to no avail. Skip this season and pray for a better one next time (if there is a next time). If this turns out to be the final season, what a lousy way to end a fantastic series.",1394668800,12,500,4.329787234042553

6018854,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Love Doc Martin!! This show just keeps getting better. Usually , a little medical tip is picked up each episode. All of the actors are just amazing. Everything just seems to flow. I love that it seems so real, and no touches or gaudiness from Hollywood. This is such a great and believe able show. Thanks also to PBS for airing this, I even watch the reruns.",1394409600,,358,4.358208955223881

6018856,5,B00FPPQYXM,As a Doc Martin addict I simply couldn't wait for season 6 to come to the US.  The season 6 is great but sad in the end. Please let there be a season 7 so Dr Ellington have time to make things right with Louisa,1394409600,,210,3.6666666666666665
6018857,5,B00FPPQYXM,"The product is excellent.  Well packaged, not a knock off or pirate copy - obviously a genuine original. The quality of the dvd was very good and had no difficulty playing it.  Doc Martin is a British series. If you like it, like we do, this is superior - if you don't like British humor, then stick to the gastly American comedy shows.",1394409600,,336,4.317460317460317
6018858,5,B00FPPQYXM,"The series has the humor to which we have become accustomed, but it is somewhat darker than the previous series have been. Don't expect the belly laughs that some past episodes have provided but the humor is still present.  We like the way that the series is more true to life than the typical TV fare... it gives the humor that edge that sometimes occurs in our lives.",1394409600,,369,4.426470588235294

6018871,2,B00FPPQYXM,This is my least favorite series of a show that I love. Why build up to the marriage over five seasons to have Doc Martin regress to a zombie like character that drives Louisa away?  He was always kind to her (in his own way) before.  Hopefully this will get resolved in the final series next year.,1394323200,4,298,4.2105263157894735

6018879,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Doc Martin is a light comedy with a plot that hooks you.  I warn you it is addictive.  Great acting, great characters.  I enjoy the DVDs because you get all the extras with them.  Which is the advantage to watching them on DVD instead of netflix.",1394236800,,246,4.282608695652174
6018880,5,B00FPPQYXM,"After six series it hasn't gotten stale. Doc always finds new ways to tick people off and PC Penhail gets more stupid all the time. Remember, it's not a real doctor show.",1394236800,,170,4.34375
6018881,5,B00FPPQYXM,"This has been my favorite television series ever. I don't want it to stop. Maybe if enough of its fans beg for it, the producers will give us another season.",1394236800,,157,4.266666666666667

6018886,3,B00FPPQYXM,"Down from five, because in the first episode of the season they were going for slapstick, but missed the mark. The laugh track type of humor (no laugh track, of course) was a departure from their
otherwise consistently charming work. I have now seen the second episode of season six, and am happy to report that the show was back up to their four or five star rating.",1394150400,,367,4.411764705882353
6018887,5,B00FPPQYXM,"The first series was a bit wild and crazy but I loved how the show took the time to show how much Doc Martin loves Louisa and his baby James.  Martin Klune nailed this one.
It s great to have the show back and I look forward to seeing the next 7 episodes. Doc Martin is a gift from acrss the pond. Thank you England.",1394150400,,316,3.8615384615384616

6018889,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Finally, Season 6 is available, and we have really missed regular visits with Doc Martin.  The same hopelessly funny curmudgeon, who imaginatively responds to weekly medical crises. I don't know what we will do when the series is finally retired, watch reruns, I imagine.",1394064000,,271,5.159090909090909

6018893,5,B00FPPQYXM,"As always, this series is filled with surprises in every episode.  Loved that it concentrated on the core 'family' this season and wasn't as fragmented with looney tunes folks coming out of every nook and cranny.  The actors are as superb as always.",1394064000,,249,4.767441860465116
6018894,5,B00FPPQYXM,It's a fantastic show. It comes on pbs so don't feel like you should buy it from here. We missed this episode and we didn't want to miss any,1394064000,,140,3.8620689655172415
6018895,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Season six was another great, but too short, season of the everyday life of Doc Martin and the citizens of Portwenn. I love this series, and hope that it continues for at least another season, to wrap things up nicely.",1394064000,,218,4.475

6018898,5,B00FPPQYXM,"This is another great series of Doc Martin.  It was sad to see it end.  The story line would obviously have to go in a different direction, but it ended well.",1394064000,,158,4.064516129032258
6018899,4,B00FPPQYXM,Although Doc Martin may not be suitabe to some people's senseabilities; But it is to me. Humor in alternate forms should not offend us but challenge our appreciation to the many ways directors and actors extend themselves to entertain us.,1393977600,,238,4.975
6018900,4,B00FPPQYXM,"I always anxiously await a new season of Doc Martin, and this one did not disappoint.  I gave it four stars instead of five because of the way the series ended.  It was so sad.  I hope another season will be produced in which Doc Martin gets the psychological help he needs.",1393977600,,274,4.230769230769231
6018901,2,B00FPPQYXM,"I have been a long-time fan of Doc Martin.  However, the writing for Season 6 leaves something to be desired.  The characters have always been a little over-the-top, which has previously made them fun and interesting.  However this season the characters are characters of themselves and the show has become simply corny rather than clever and funny.
I won't waist my time on this series after watching a few shows.  I bought the entire series and want a refund on the remaining shows.",1393977600,4,484,4.795180722891566

6018903,4,B00FPPQYXM,It is such an odd town with odd people but they play well together.  It all seems natural to them.  It is even funnier to see Doc Martin be so up-standish but in real life he is the complete opposite.  Episode 1 was just hilarious.,1393977600,,231,4.088888888888889

Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys the British drama/comedy genre, or close studies of human nature in general. What a rare combination of character development and consistently good storytelling. It makes me think of ""Northern Exposure"" across the pond, with its cast of quirky characters who never fail to delight people of all ages.

Start with Season 1 for the best understanding of the characters and continuity!",1393804800,,562,5.0978260869565215

6018926,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I chose to give a 5 star rating because Doc is portrayed as human, like any ordinary  persons  with flaws... His flaws fit right in with the episodes, that, to me, deal with situations we all experience from day to day that we solve  by applying  the practical approach to life i.e. learned in bible class, self help books. OPRAH, life.  He learns a lesson and moves on.  I luv this show.  Hope it is available forever...

6018928,3,B00FPPQYXM,"Although we have been enjoying all of Doc Martin and his many odd friends, patients and neighbors we were really really disappointed with the last episode of Season 6. Their was no happy ending for Louisa and Martin. He just left her in hospital with tears in her eyes. I would have liked there to be a romance blossom between Al and Rowena.
So I now hope there will be another season which just might make up for the letdown.",1393718400,,426,4.3375

6018931,5,B00FPPQYXM,Loved the sixth installment of Doc Martin. Enjoyed every episode. The new characters were very entertaining. I sincerely hope that there is going to be a season seven.,1393718400,,167,5.0
6018932,5,B00FPPQYXM,"The people in this movie have almost become like neighbors. This series is well written, wonderfully acted, and the scenery in the background is breath taking. I love this whole group, from grumpy Doc Martin to Bert, who is always trying to make money, and never really succeeding. As for little James Henry, this is the most darling little boy I have ever set my eyes on, in a series.  I understand there is a multiple birth, concerning the child, or children playing James Henry, so that there is always the right baby for the scene, be it crying, sleeping, happy or cranky.
With this series, I would start at the beginning with series 1 it is best to do it that way, and far less confusing.",1393718400,,693,4.456692913385827
6018933,4,B00FPPQYXM,"Am I the only one tired of Louisa? The acting is great, no complaints there, but her character is so selfish .... she constantly, without exception, treats Martin not as he is, but how she feels the ideal man should be, and then gets all mad when he's not that ideal man. Well, she KNEW who he was when she married him, yes? Why can't she take care of him, for goodness sake? Listen to him, pay attention to how he expresses love, rather than pining over the fact that he doesn't express himself the same way everyone else does. She aggravates me. EVERY time she asks him to do something, all series long, Doc Martin ends up saying ""yes"" and giving her just about whatever she wants (with the exception of the refused chat-and-breakfast). In contrast, every time he asks something of her, the answer is ""No, you must do things MY way because that's how things are done!"" Very very poor way to treat your significant other, if you ask me. She never gives, but rather takes, takes, takes, never even tries to be understanding about how he feels, and then blows up because he's not giving her everything else she wants, too. GRRR.

Perhaps I'm so sore about this because my own spouse is very quiet and subtle with emotion and expressions of love. You have to learn to really listen to those kinds of people, and stay a step ahead accommodating their feelings in order to help them feel loved. And no matter who you marry, you have to adapt your life a little to what they like, what they don't like, and how they feel about things. I mean, forcing Martin to go to story time at the library? Really? Although this was a hilarious and priceless scene for the series, it made it clear how very low Louisa was treating him.
I mean, when he points out that the baby is only 6 months old and might not be benefiting a whole awful lot from interacting with other kids his age at this point in his life, Louisa brushes him off and stomps all over him until he gives in -- she couldn't possibly be bothered with actually listening to her husband and certainly can't be bothered with CONCEDING that he might have a POINT. Louisa, you can't stomp all over the spouse you love and married, just because they neither express themselves in heated, emotional arguments nor in romantic declarations of warm fuzzies. You gotta watch and listen to them extra carefully and take their feelings into consideration even if they don't want to do things ""just like everyone else."" Sheesh...
Not to mention that every time he DOES try (like when he invited people to dinner) she slaps him down again because he doesn't read her mind and do everything exactly the way she wants it....

Any wonder why Doc Martin is increasingly reserved towards her? Hahaha. I was sooo hoping that the final conversation between Ruth and Martin was actually going to be between Ruth and Louisa. Or that at LEAST Martin's mother would give her an emotional slap. But it was not to be, sadly....

Doc Martin is as reserved and subtle as ever, which I love. Unfortunately he is not quite as cute and touching with his baby boy as I'd hoped, but he is still awfully fun to watch, as father, as husband, as doctor, and as a community member. I still love all the subtleties of his character. I still love how he treats everyone at Port Wenn. Still love all the supporting cast and I think Bert does a particularly shining job this season. Bert provided all the heartwarming moments that were more or less missing from the Martin-Louisa interactions.",1393632000,,3500,4.517350157728707

After waiting so long for Martin and Louisa to get married, it turned into a disaster, the rest of this series followed, every episode was worse than the previous. The writers made Martin so unlikeable I can't help but wonder, what did the people who gave this 5 stars watch?  What a disappointment!",1393459200,10,469,4.517647058823529

As the series progresses, the characters are developed more deeply than before and I could see the relationship between Louisa and Martin grow.  It's wonderful to get more insight into Martin's personality and to see his vulnerabilities while his love for Louisa and their son is shown.

He is an amazingly knowledgeable doctor who came from London to be the doctor for a small village. His lack of civility and social capabilities is astounding and yet endearing.  You can't help but empathize with Martin as he puts up with some very strange characters. At the same time, you often feel the urge to throttle him for being so impolite to the townspeople, especially his special girl, Louisa.

6018976,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I have  the complete series of The Closure and wanted to keep watching the team of actors in the spin off series Major Crimes
I have series 1-5 of Doc Martin so I am a fan.

I am afraid I won't be ordering much from you any more because of the exchange rate.  It is too expensive for a pensioner like me",1393113600,,303,3.8548387096774195
6018977,5,B00FPPQYXM,"What statement of persona, a Doc who
can't understand the feelings of people,
but wants so badly to be normal, but  a
hell of a Doctor, lots of humor, and delima,
really love the show.",1393113600,,184,4.257142857142857
6018978,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Really enjoyed series 6 and hope the series continues. Another one of those British comedies that you simply fall in love with, both the charters and the charming English settings.",1393113600,,180,5.033333333333333
6018979,3,B00FPPQYXM,The first episode is great and showed what they could have done with the rest of the season.  Martin is allowed to make a joke and Louisa shows her nutty side.  It seems like the two main characters will finally find common ground against a world that will never understand their love.  But then the writers fall back into the standard formula and around we go again with Martin never saying the right thing and Louisa always distracted when he does start to speak up.  The series ends with yet another breakup and reunion.  Come on writers!  Let these characters grow!,1393027200,13,569,4.584158415841584
6018980,5,B00FPPQYXM,"This series will just grown on you.  He's always saying stuff that is so insensitive and yet he's obviously good at what he does, and he also cares.  We would kindly say he has no ""bedside"" manner.  :-)  Give it a try.",1393027200,,218,4.119047619047619

6018983,3,B00FPPQYXM,"It was not as good as earlier seasons.  It was much darker.  It's time for Doc Martin to grow a little bit.  Enough with the tension between Martin and Louisa.  The ending of season 5 led me to believe there had been a breakthrough, but, instead, the situation between them appears to be getting worse.  The writers need to find a way to keep Martin's irascible character without destroying Louisa in the process.",1393027200,3,413,4.602739726027397

6018985,5,B00FPPQYXM,"If you're a fan of British TV, you'll appreciate this quirky series. I won't recap the story line or characters - others have done that very well. Suffice it to say that if you like idiosycnratic, eccentric and peculiar characters, you'll love this. I would suggest strongly that you start with the first series - the stories build on each other and if you start with Series 6, you'll know nothing of the history of the prickly doc and various relatives and townspeople. LOVED this whole series. Recommended.",1393027200,,508,4.784090909090909

6018987,4,B00FPPQYXM,"There is just not enough TV like this out there. The small town characters are quirky, yes, but they also reveal universal themes about relationships. This season examined how and why people need one another, the masks we wear, the truths about ourselves that we don't want to see, the danger of self-delusion, the consequences of not reaching out, knowing our own vulnerability. All this medicine comes in a cocktail of humor and beautiful seascape. That said, I am a little tired of the theme of Doctor Ellingham's inability to come out of his dour shell, paired as he is with the most lovely and giving woman in the village, Louisa. I do root for them to stay together, but this season found myself wanting to tell Louisa -- ""just dump him, he'll never get it."" Another season will perhaps allow the crooked dynamic of this marriage either to transform or end completely. Which would break everyone's hearts. The writers better figure out a way to move this plot device along. It's getting old.",1392940800,,997,4.735632183908046
6018988,5,B00FPPQYXM,Missed the first few episodes of season 6 so I was able to get caught up thanks to Amazon. Thanks for offering it through Roku.  Just discovered this show last year.  PBS has discovered another fantastic show from Great Britain.,1392940800,,228,4.675
6018989,5,B00FPPQYXM,"When you think you have Doc Martin figured out the series delivers a twist that gives you hope for shared happiness, but then..... well watch and see :-) A great tease of a TV show in the best sense of the word, whose actors deliver great characters you root for because none are perfect in that cliched USA way.",1392854400,,312,4.305084745762712

6018993,5,B00FPPQYXM,"We're still loving this series.  Perfect entertainment for cold, snowy evenings and food for chuckles and smiles.  What a character!  He is going to change, isn't he?",1392854400,,166,5.074074074074074
6018994,5,B00FPPQYXM,This show is absolutely wonderful. The people and the settings are unusual and capture my interest. I only wish Doc Martin would loosen up and change his personality a little now that he has married the woman he loves and has his precious son. He should be opening up just a little as a result of these huge changes in his life.,1392854400,,328,4.306451612903226
6018995,5,B00FPPQYXM,"We have enjoyed following Doc Martin from the day he arrived in Portwenn,  He is extremely rude and I don't know how people live with him, but I still keep watching.  In Series 6 he seems to be softening,  I don't know how much longer they can milk this storyline.  Sometimes it gets totally ridiculous, but we will still see it to the end.",1392854400,,340,4.265625
6018996,5,B00FPPQYXM,"If you haven't watched Doc Martin, you are missing it!  The cranky doctor has a practice in a small coastal town in England.  He'd really rather not be there, and the whacky cast of patients and main characters drives him crazy.  Lots of very funny moments, and many poignant ones also.  You'll enjoy some great scenic shots of the town, the surrounding country and the sea.",1392854400,,374,4.621212121212121

6019005,4,B00FPPQYXM,It's a bit dreary after so many episodes with the Dr. being such a putts all the time without let up. But the characters are amusing enough that it's worth watching. Didn't care much for the earlier episode with the seventy plus year old aunt in sex scenes.,1392768000,,257,4.375
6019006,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I feel in love with this show watching with my mom... which led me to the internet to watch them ALL.
And I did but couldn't fine season 6 until I came to Amazon!!  It is a wonderful show.  Funny British humor!!",1392768000,,211,4.0
6019007,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Very enjoyable series, hoping that UK will make another one, to at least clear up the loose ends - too many left open",1392768000,,117,4.130434782608695
6019008,5,B00FPPQYXM,"After watching the earlier series 1-4 and then the fifth series we were delighted that a Series 6 was made!  We didn't wait for the TV to carry it and bought our own DVD of it so we could watch it on our time.  Absolutely loved it!!  With new writers, we weren't sure how it would turn out.  It definitely kept us in the story line then entire time.  I hope there is a series 7 and beyond!!",1392768000,,390,3.948717948717949
6019009,4,B00FPPQYXM,"We like the combination of low brow, high brow, and uniquely British humor and travel advertisement for Cornwall.  Characters are quirky but all somewhat likable.  Great way to escape for an hour.",1392768000,,196,5.09375
6019010,5,B00FPPQYXM,This is a fun series to watch..the scenery of the little town in Wales is lovely.  The doctor has lots of issues and even tho it is a slow moving story the characters grow on you.,1392768000,,179,3.9722222222222223
6019011,4,B00FPPQYXM,The first three episodes of Season 6 are among the best Doc Martin episodes of all time. It is rare enough for a long-running series to maintain its quality. It is even more rare for that show to be even better in its most recent season. Very highly recommended for fans. And a great way to introduce your reluctant friends to the series.,1392681600,,338,4.380952380952381

This is for the entire family and we all enjoy the storyline.",1392681600,,129,4.2
6019013,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I watch this show with my children (not too young though), lots of blood and sudden accidents due to the nature of the show, but for the humor and entertainment value, this is top notch.  Martin Clunes is a phenomenal actor and plays this part excellently.  The beauty of the English countryside is also pure escapism...",1392681600,,320,4.696428571428571
6019014,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I love the series.  If you have watched the first series until know, you can see the development of the good doctor.  You can see how he changes through the years.  Wonderful supporting actors/characters.  Love Carolyn Cats as the Doc's frustrated wife.  I did want one more episode to tie-up some loose ends, but I guess it opens it up for another series (which I hope there is)",1392681600,,379,4.514705882352941
6019015,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I have DVR'd the entire series but I simply could not wait to be able to see all of Season 6.
This is terrific.  I think some of the very best episode of the entire series sit in Season 6.
I have been a fan of Marty Clunes since Men Behaving Badly.  He is terrific.  All the much more so because you know in real life he is a happy, animal lover with a smile that brightens the room. ENJOY!",1392681600,,390,3.85
6019016,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Every time the producers of this series choose to film another season (they don't film every year), I am on pins and needles waiting for it to be released on DVD!  The original cast is brought back year after year which draws the viewers into the up and down relationship between ""Doc Martin Ellingham"" and his new wife ""Louisa"".  This series is similar to a soap opera in which each episode links to the next.  The doctor's gruff nature combined with the quirks of the townspeople offers a brand of comedy not found in most American television.  Very enjoyable!  Recommendation:  Watch the seasons in order to really understand the storyline.",1392681600,,643,4.8

6019020,5,B00FPPQYXM,To finally see Martin and Louisa get married was worth every minute.  I only wish it had turned out better on the honeymoon side of things but this is the relationship they have always had.  One of my favorite shows!  I would recommend everyone see this series from the beginning.  The characters become your friends and I believe that is the magic of this series.  I never miss an episode if I can help it and I did miss this one so I bought it and watched hours before the second aired.  That's how important this show is to me.  I absolutely love it!,1392595200,,553,4.259615384615385
6019021,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Frankly I haven't had time to view this; however I have so enjoyed Series 1 through 5 that I can guarantee that this will be a winner as well.  The more I rerun the first 5 series, the funnier they become.",1392595200,,205,4.0
6019022,4,B00FPPQYXM,"I read quite a few reviews here after watching Ep. 1 of Series 6, because I was so disappointed with that episode. And I found several reviewers that agreed with me and then they went on to say how bad the entire Series 6 was and how they couldn't understand all the five star reviews. However, I continued to watch the entire series, and I did end up really enjoying it. I do have a few gripes: I wish Martin had been more like what he claimed he wanted to be at the end of Series 5 (when he said he didn't want to be like his parents). However, that proclamation seems to have been forgotten by the writers of this series, as he seems to be as impenetrable and unemotional as ever. I also think that the last episode was too much of a cliffhanger to be a finale. The last episode of Series 5 would have been a good finale, as things seemed to be all wrapped up. However, the end of this series leaves too many questions unanswered. I do hope they write at least one more episode to tidy up the story, somewhat. Don't leave us hanging, Doc Martin!!",1392595200,,1049,4.172413793103448
6019023,5,B00FPPQYXM,I would certainly recommend this for Doc Martin lovers! Martin and Luise get married in the first chapter!!!! The entire DVD is worth it!! Will be waiting for Series 7,1392595200,,167,4.6
6019024,5,B00FPPQYXM,Have been following this quirky series from the beginning. Sort of sorry we bought this complete season as we sat down to a marathon of watching over a weekend and now can only wait and hope that there will be a next season. Damned Brits put out the best programming! Excellent!,1392595200,,278,4.470588235294118

6019031,5,B00FPPQYXM,We love this series.  They could never produce tooooo many of these episodes.  Three cheers for the genius behind it and those whp act in it.  They are the best.,1392508800,,161,4.3
6019032,1,B00FPPQYXM,"The negative reviews in the UK were on target. I am mystified that there are so many 5-star reviews on Amazon because the producer, writers, directors, and actors succeeded in only one thing--ruining an entertaining series.

Season 6 is unrecognizable as a continuation of the series. Let's remember how season 5 ended. The doctor was beginning to show a little humanity and express other feelings besides disgust and anger. In season 6, he is more of a jerk than ever.

Not only do we have him at his insufferable worst throughout season 6, the writers have thrown in one after another preposterous, silly, and mean character and episode. A stalker. A crazy man with a gun living in the woods who Martin and Louisa happen upon at night in their wedding clothes. A severed carotid artery. Martin throwing up. The return of the crazy pharmacist and the nails-on-blackboard reappearance of Martin's mother. It's like an American soap opera at its worst. AWFUL.",1392508800,15,958,4.907407407407407

6019053,5,B00FPPQYXM,"The entire Doc Martin series is mesmerizing.  Martin Clunes nails his character. A fantastic doctor even though he gets sick at the sight of blood.

A bit more serious with their marriage....they left it as a cliff hanger so I sure hope they make another season!

Season 6 just began on PBS, & I didn't record this first episode, therefore, Amazon to the rescue.

6019064,5,B00FPPQYXM,Doc Martin is a little known series from American Public Broadcasting.  It is a story about a quirky doctor who leaves London for a tiny seaside community in England.  Most of the residents have their own unique personalities.  I suggest you begin with Season 1 if you have never seen it.  Every episode will have you laughing while still being touched by the storyline.  The acting is terrific led by Martin Clunes who perfectly portrays the enigmatic doctor.  I wait impatiently every year for the new season to begin; I hope it continues for many more seasons.,1392076800,,563,4.752577319587629

6019068,4,B00FPPQYXM,"well, i only watched the first episode in which martin finally marries the woman who has had his baby--so i won't give the storyline away here, but the series is fresh and sort of quirky too. 'doc' is usually brash and unflinching when dealing with his many patients, who have numerous medical conditions, but there is NO doubt that he really does want what's best for them even if he has trouble conveying it to them. i would like to see an 'american' version of this series premise, but the 'brits' have beat us to punch on this one.",1391990400,,535,4.414141414141414

6019078,5,B00FPPQYXM,"This set also includes some interviews you will find informative. Everyone in the village is expecting Doc Martin to change
and this is part of what makes the scenes so funny and touching at the same time. Who or what will finally ""get through"" that hard exterior and bring Martin off his high horse? Maybe he's beginning to mellow?  Maybe next season. Or the next, maybe. I really hope he doesn't lose his edge, he is what he is.
The producers left the series open for another season, and of course we encourage
them to keep on as long as they can make it as good. This show is truly a labor of love.",1391904000,,601,4.271929824561403

6019083,2,B00FPPQYXM,"It's a good series gone tired.  It's still charming but unbearably repetitive, and, worse, the two principal actors have gotten so much visibly older that it's lost its underpinnings of young woman & mature man--now it's mature woman and old man.",1391904000,5,246,5.0

6019088,5,B00FPPQYXM,"This series has been so good, so well-written and acted. Love the character of Doc Martin, he's so frustrating sometimes, you want him to just get out of his own way.

6019121,5,B00FPPQYXM,I love this series.  I watch it weekly and have felt badly when I miss even recording it.  This year I decided to order the whole series.  I started and could not stop watching it.  Each time ends compelling you to watch the following program.  The season ended the same way.  Can Doc Martin who obviously loves and values his family come through?  Doc Martin's medical heroism and the town characters and their lives all add to the entertaining drama.  When can I order Series 7?,1391385600,,480,4.5

The characters are real and we see in this series the beginning of the transformation of the Doc. The series ends' leaving you wanting more and giving the producers and writers  plenty of opportunity to carry this forward. Some of the off camera interviews indicate this may be a possibility.

6019144,2,B00FPPQYXM,"I enjoyed series 1-5 very much.  However, series six showed a dramatic change in each and every actor's personalities. Everyone seemed to go to the dark side. Martin was more brisk than ever and the relationship between Louisa and Martin became very sad and hopeless. I also felt shortchanged by the continuance of only eight episodes and the likeliness of a two year wait for a possible series 7. What is with that? With the concluding episode (episode 8) what is left?  Although the majority of reviewers appear to remain happy with the Doc Martin series, I felt, like a few other reviewers, very disappointed with this latest release.",1391040000,10,637,4.834862385321101

I meanwhile ordered all the episodes and have watched them twice and each time I pick up more bits that I overlooked the first time.  The acting is superb in all episodes and the area where it is filmed is beautiful.  Having lived in small towns I've known some of these very characters and know they exist in real life.  After becoming familiar with this series I then looked up other productions where Martin Clunes appeared.  I found him early on in a bit part in Jeeves and Wooster which I already owned and then ordered other films in which he'd appeared.  I have enjoyed every one of these episodes and hope they can continue for a while longer.",1391040000,,800,4.445205479452055

6019151,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I really enjoy watching Doc Martin. Season 6 was the best! I honestly appreciate that the program is clean. There was one episode I thought was AWFUL and it almost stopped me from watching altogether. Trying to explain aunt Joans unsavory, over dramatized behavior with her artist lover was just too much for this momma. I am very pleased there has been no more scenarios like that one. We need more family friendly programs. PLEASE make season 7. It's true, in the US we wait a long time to see it, but it's worth the wait.",1390953600,,524,4.46875
6019152,2,B00FPPQYXM,"I tried but failed to make it through the whole episode of Season 6/ Episode 1. It seemed so rote and uninspired.

6019153,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Although Clunes' character has become less likeable in series five and six, that is probably necessary in order to understand the reasons for much of Doc Martin's behavior.

6019158,5,B00FPPQYXM,"The title sums up how I feel about the Doc Martin series. I have all six seasons plus the two movies and love each and every one of them. I truly hope Martin Clunes and the rest of the cast come back to do more seasons and I hope they don't make us wait two years each time.

The setting of Portwenn (Port  Isaac) is gorgeous. The main character, Doc Martin, is a lovable and irascible curmudgeon of a guy. He truly cares about his patients but can't seem to remember their names. It's funny just to see how he mangles the names of his patients, sometimes calling them by the wrong name several times and never getting it right. You have to be a Doc Martin fan to appreciate that and I am unabashedly a big fan. Doc seems to get irritated by the slightest little thing, including a tenacious little dog, but this is just part of the story. The illnesses he treats are real and I actually learn something from watching.

Each time I watch the DVDs, I get something new out of them. I must have watched each DVD five or six times already!

The other characters are equally enjoyable. The show sports two beauties, Louisa (Doc's love interest) and Morwenna (his cute and perky receptionist). His previous receptionists, Elaine and Pauline, were fun to watch and I was sad to see them leave the series.

Ex-plumber and now restaurant owner, Bert Large (played by Ian McNeice), is so funny he could have his own spinoff. Of all the characters, Bert is actually my favorite. I crack up each time I see him. He even fell asleep on the floor of Doc's surgery in the middle of a procedure!

The dedicated but totally inept PC Penhale tries so hard but always manages to bungle things. The actor who portrays him, John Marquez, totally nails it. You have to wonder what will he screw up this time?

Even the growing friendship between Martin's Aunt Ruth and Bert's son, Al, is interesting to watch and makes you wonder what will happen next. Even the lovelorn chemist, Mrs. Tischel, elicits a laugh. On top of a great cast and great stories, Doc Martin has interesting guests who manage to bring out the best (and worst) in Doc.

My only complaint is that I sometimes have difficulty understanding those English (Cornish) accents. The producers could work on that.

In short, I love the whole series. I hope the players and producers  read this and the other comments and decide to make more. And more. And more. I have not enjoyed a series as much as I have Doc Martin since Monk went off the air.",1390953600,,2488,4.4483516483516485

6019160,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Doc Martin is different from most of tv - The lead characters are interesting , some I like - others are annoying - Doc is the most interesting and the most obnoxuous - but manages to convey that under all that nastiness, is a good man with a kind heart - he needs help.

6019167,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Being an enthusiast of British tv and movies, I was happy to find such an original series
via one of my local PBS stations, here in New York back in 2012.
I have seen every episode of Doc Martin up to and including Hazardous Exposure from the new Series, No. 6,
and have recommended all of Doc Martin series to several friends for the humour, originality, intellect, eccentric storylines and the character interactions, which are some of the best in modern tv.  The stories have cheered me up, during a long illness.
From the first episode of Series One, Martin Clunes' exceptional acting and funny mannerisms as the local GP of the small, endearing fishing village of Portwenn(Port Isaac in real life), are so very interesting to watch that even people who had never seen him before in tv or film, were hooked.  The landscape is stunning, and the village itself is another star in the show.  With exceptional acting by Caroline Catz, Ian McNeice, Stephanie Cole, Katherine Parkinson, Joe Absolom, and many others, Doc Martin is among my favourites, from the UK, and this is coming from years of enjoying fine British shows.  I have recommended Doc Martin to many people and will continue to do so!",1390867200,,1198,4.7451923076923075

Quality of recordings on DVD were first rate.",1390867200,,198,4.9393939393939394
6019170,5,B00FPPQYXM,Love this show.  We watched the first series and became fans..  The scenery alone is worth watching the show.. It is situated in the port city of Port Wenn (Port Isaac in real  life).  If you watch it you will become a Doc Martin Fan.

6019173,4,B00FPPQYXM,"The Doc Martin series is one of the better TV comedies I have seen. It is not a hip smarmy grabass half hour frolic so  popular on today's TV.. If you enjoyed the antics of Basil Fawlty the pompous owner/manager of Fawlty Towers You will enjoy the irascible Dr. Martin Ellingham the brilliant  GP  without  a shred of bedside manner in a small Cornish town populated with eccentrics.
Sadly , even very good shows reach a point where new ideas do not come easily to the writers'  . Season 6 was not on a par with earlier seasons. It would not  surprise me if season six is the last of the series..",1390867200,,596,4.276785714285714

6019179,2,B00FPPQYXM,"I was intensly disappointed at how the series ended. It really was disappointing all the way through.

6019183,3,B00FPPQYXM,"This was not up to the standard of excellence in the prior 5 seasons.  The wedding episode was just absolutely deplorable.  Also, Martin should have evolved into a more normal being by now.  The fact that he seems so emotionally constipated that even the birth of his son doesn't humanize him, takes the humor out of his testiness.  Since I have been such a huge fan of the season, I stayed with it and watched all the episodes, but I didn't laugh once.  It was all too predictable.  And Louisa dismissing him at the end - I don't care  what happens to any of them at this point.  The scenery is luscious, though.",1390867200,2,613,4.3628318584070795

6019185,3,B00FPPQYXM,"Doc Martin 6 has been my least favorite series.  Starts off with a slapstick episode and then descends into dark, serious drama.  Much of the charm, lightness, and humor of the earlier 5-star-rated series rapidly disappears.  The idea of the producers to make Martin grumpier and more unreasonable as time goes on becomes rather grating.  One hopes to see the slightest signs of personal growth and enlightenment as a character develops, but this series (except perhaps at the very end) leaves us disappointed in this regard.  And much the same with the other characters who largely remain unchanged, even those who've had harrowing experiences.",1390780800,43,645,5.163461538461538

6019187,4,B00FPPQYXM,"I have loved all of the comedy and charm and intrigue of this series.  It is getting me through 40 below F temeperatures this January, BUT if this series ends with Martin and louisa splitting as she oves over to Spain, then where is the promise of huan love or transformation?  I think that a show can be comic and tragic at the same time, and this show has been  ---but it would be aweful to have it end on the tragedy of love so close but so far.  Please let us have a season 7 and please let us see some change.  Glum not to end on in Janaury, especially when I have to go to work now and work with couples as a psychotherapist.

The consequences of their surprise ""honeymoon"" in a cottage......and Louisa drudging through mud in her wedding dress.. I won't say anymore.  I recommend all of the series, as they are so hysterically funny.

I knew exactly who she meant. She was hooked. I told her to get the entire series on Amazon. It has to be watched from beginning to end, not in the middle which is sometimes how it appears on PBS.

6019195,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Doc Martin is a truly unique British series. If you are not familiar with prior episodes it may be difficult to pick up the threads of this comedic drama.

6019200,5,B00FPPQYXM,"It feels that good ol' Martin is slowly, slowly changing in a believable, consistent way, becoming more lovably complex.  And of course Louisa is fabulous.  And I love having Eileen Atkins in the show.  And ooh that baby is good ;)",1390435200,,231,4.585365853658536
6019201,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Another great season of Doc Martin.  If you haven't seen any of the Doc Martin series, I highly recommend it. Another great British show, mostly comedy, but there are serious issues dealt with in the series.  I think most Americans would get the humor within the show. Basically the Doc is a fish out of water in many ways. Many times there is humor in that.  I do not want to give away the story plots of the season for those who have not seen it.  Season 6 has not appeared on PBS yet in America.  I hope they continue with a Season 7.",1390435200,,537,4.125

 great acting too.",1390435200,,117,4.523809523809524
6019206,5,B00FPPQYXM,Do Martin has a series of recurring characters who each have their weaknesses and strengths. The close knit but quirky village is delightful to watch. There is a surprise around every corner.,1390435200,,191,5.0

6019209,5,B00FPPQYXM,I absolutely love this series! Doc Martin is a real character and I mentally keep scolding him for being so churlish but if he weren't it wouldn't be so funny. Thanks for having this available.,1390348800,,193,4.542857142857143
6019210,5,B00FPPQYXM,"It was so nice to reunite with Doc, Louisa and all the people of Port Wein after too long an absence. This is a series in which you really grow to care for all the characters, even curmudgeonly ol' Doc Martin.  Sad to think this is the final season.",1390348800,,249,4.081632653061225
6019211,5,B00FPPQYXM,Best thing on tv! You just can't wait for the next episode.....please have a season 7!!  And then a season 8!,1390348800,,109,4.190476190476191
6019212,5,B00FPPQYXM,"We have watched all the Doc Martin series back to season 1 on Netflix.  Enjoyed it tremendously.  We knew that season 6 had been released but Netflix didn't have it.  We got a Roku for Christmas and found it on Amazon.  It wasn't part of our Prime subscription so we had to buy it but seeing it in HD (the ones on Netflix were not), it was worth it.  The town of ""Portwenn"" (it's actually Port Isaac - we want to go and see it) is just beautiful and the sound quality through my surround system is excellent.  Definitely worth the money.  If you have a Netflix subscription, go back and see the first 5 seasons and then treat yourself to this one.  Highly recommended.",1390348800,,668,4.288
6019213,4,B00FPPQYXM,"I love how the BBC combines talented actors with brilliant writers to consistently supply quality, entertaining content. I also appreciate how the actors look like normal, everyday blokes who you might actually run into on the streets of London or, in this case, on the steep steps and narrow winding streets of the small seaside fishing village.

Doc Martin is a crabby but brilliant old bugger who can infuriate even the nicest, most forgiving person in the village; yet because he can diagnose what ails ye in nearly an instant, followed by a cure, he is tolerated in the small hamlet where he is the only doctor. As episodes continue, viewers and villagers come to realize Doc Martin's lack of bedside manner is not entirely his fault. Nor is his social deficit something he can easily change.

Enter the school teacher who, while she can become just as infuriated with Doc Martin as the rest of us, recognizes both his brilliance and his vulnerabilities. Over the course of several episodes, she works to expose the softer-ish side of Doc Martin, and in so doing saves his life--by introducing him to the fun bits that can be part of daily living.

Sprinkled in are the brilliant additions of Doc Martin's aunts, eventually both main characters' estranged moms, a revolving door of wacky but warm receptionists, and a village of lovable lunatics, from the bumbling plumber turned restauranteur and his affable son to the off-balance pharmacist.

Reading this glowing review might make one wonder about the missing star....

Unfortunately not all the characters contribute to the forward progress of the series. Barney Fife and his antics on ""The Andy Griffith Show"" drove me crazy as a kid; the constable in this series gets more bumbling with time, which beyond annoying the audience, also takes us out of the story and reminds us we are watching a fictional series. I blame the writing on this one.

While it is only one character who pushes the idiocy too far, the series is a top-notch dramedy (drama meets comedy) that entertains and will have you laughing, cringing and possibly even crying throughout.

Enjoy!

6019214,3,B00FPPQYXM,The first episode was so painfully awkward I was embarrassed to watch it. The subsequent episodes were better but the whole season left me feeling sad. Although there are humorous moments they are not as naturally done and the lightheartedness is more contrived. Martins mental health issues leave a dark cloud over the entire series that instead of being amusing borders on medical malpractice. Please fix these issues. The development of the other characters is what saved this season!,1390348800,2,487,5.177215189873418

Port Whenn is delightful and Doc Martin is a brilliant doctor and such a toad of a man.  This is well worth viewing.  My wife and I are on Season 6, the 5 seasons are exceptional as well and I encourage watching all of the seasons and enjoy the funny story of a London surgeon who can't stand the sight of blood that moves to quaint Port Whenn in Cornwall to become their village GP.

6019229,5,B00FPPQYXM,You either love it or hate it. I find that I love it. It is just my speed and a perfect series to get caught up on with all of this cold weather. I would encourage a viewer to dive into the previous series as doing so will give you a greater appreciation. Cheers!,1390176000,,263,3.888888888888889

6019231,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I really do like this series and it seems it just gets better and better.  He is so hateful and not able to express his feelings yet at the same time is admired by all who know him.  He is a great doctor.  We have learned a lot about medicine since we started seeing this program.  His funny ways are delightful and yet knowing his past, we all forgive him.  I would like a doctor who is so truly honest about his patient care. This series must continue!",1390176000,,454,4.113636363636363

Can't wait for season SEVEN! We need more programming like this!!",1390089600,,118,4.95
6019235,3,B00FPPQYXM,"This series has become too hard-edged for me. The wedding episode was harrowing; the sports day prize-giving, appalling. The way the Doc treats his wife and his receptionist is extremely ill-mannered and often downright nasty. The hospital ending didn't redeem it for me. His wife is well rid of him. Blaming his parents for his total lack of consideration for others is just a yuppy cop-out.

It was interesting that the cast talked about the series as though it was a comedy. However, although there were some comic moments mostly related to the minor characters, Series 6 is a depressing description of the breakdown of a disastrous marriage. If there is a Series 7,  a happy reconciliation as a result of a complete change of the Doctor's personality just won't be credible.",1390089600,9,778,4.886363636363637

6019250,4,B00FPPQYXM,"It seemed to take Doc a long time to find his voice this season. The snarky and snarly looks were there, however, it seemed as if his lines were few and far between. Some of the loose story lines didn't seem to get resolved; i.e. the alcoholic school board chairman who fell off the building. Did the gymnasium ever get approved for the school?
I was quite happy to see Bert Large finally get a partner. Somehow they fit. Maybe she'll be a good influence on him if he doesn't go to prison for electrocuting the D.J.
Louisa is so long suffering, so it was great to see her finally stand her ground and deliver an ultimatum. The whole disaster at the field day and her accident following was gruesome. It was Doc at both his worst and best. I found the scene where he locked the other surgeon in the closest far fetched though. And how did he get operating privileges so quickly. I'm  a hospital administrator, and trust me, it's not going to happen in a week, much less a couple of hours.
Mrs. Tishell returning doesn't add to my enjoyment of the show. Not so with Ruth. Eileen Atkins is a British treasure and adds so much depth to the show. I love her surrogate mom relationship with Al Large. The two of them are my favorite characters. They are people I would have a lot of respect for in real life. Honest and self-aware.",1390003200,,1325,4.342741935483871

6019253,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Wonderful plot twists.  The author is realistic in having the heroine leave Doc Martin. No one could put up with that quirky personality

6019277,5,B00FPPQYXM,"It is rare that a comedy series captures the audience in the way Doc Martin has done.  Each season is a welcome treat and an escape from the seriousness of the world to a world where there is a silliness with style,  From the music to the scenery, every frame of the series is a delight to watch, and amusing without having to forfeit IQ points to get the humor.  I recommend getting every series and watching the characters bloom.",1389744000,,431,4.3625

6019291,4,B00FPPQYXM,"I ordered this as a gift for my wife, since the new season (aka series) wasn't available yet on PBS or Netflix.  Very happy with it.

The only caveat: When viewed on a standard definition TV (or 4:3 SDTV mode on an HDTV), the picture is clearly squashed horizontally, making everyone look thinner than normal.  On our HDTV, we put the set in ""wide screen"" 16:9 mode, and everything looked normal, without any noticeable loss of picture quality. Our DVD player doesn't do any up-conversion.",1389657600,,489,4.729411764705882

ARE a fan, then this is a treat.  I do miss the suspense of wondering if, when, and how the Doc and Louisa will have meaningful romantic moments, will they get married, or even end up living in the same town, etc. But it is a joy just to see the old gang again.

6019308,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Doc Martin is maybe my favorite series.  The 6th season seemed not as fresh but I think it's hard to beat earlier episodes and can be repetitive though I think they are on to something if they are having Martin trying to change his difficult personality.  I certainly would not stay married long to him if I was Louise.  Maybe for the baby's sake they'll work harder at their relationship, and not be so totally career oriented.",1389571200,,428,4.532467532467533

6019316,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Doc Martin is superb.  Well written, great cast and superb performances by all of the characters, Doc Martin deliveres each episode and season.  Laced with the typical English humor, we get a chance to learn about how Doc comes to be as he is; no sentimentality plagues this series; instead, the script writers allow Doc Martin to evolve until we are laughing, shaking our heads and waiting for Doc's next run through the China Closet.  A great joy to watch and some of the best entertainment I've seen in years.",1389484800,2,512,4.666666666666667

6019332,4,B00FPPQYXM,"I absolutely adore the scenery and story line of the ""Doc Martin"" series.  I absolutely hate that there is no guarantee of a Series 7.  Series 6 was wonderful, yet I dreaded coming to the end of #8, and after watching each episode, I was saddened by the ending.  Hopefully, with all the millions of viewers begging, pleading, hoping and wishing for a Series 7, the producers and cast will give us at least 2 or 3 more.  Fingers crossed.",1389398400,,436,4.4125

6019334,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Whereas we found Series 5 a bit hard edged and not as much fun (Louisa seems to always be quite cranky and mean to Martin), Series 6 seems to have found itself again., Everyone seemed to be back to their old selves with Portwenn just as quirky as ever. This is a show that is always fun to revisit. The characters seem right out of small town anywhere. Rather than regurgitate what everyone else has written, if you are a fan of quality British comedy, ""Doc Martin"" is one of that genre: quality writing, production, interesting characters, never takes itself too seriously, and so on. Claire Bloom, appears again as Martin's stiff, loveless mother, leading to a rather terse confrontation about why she is really in Portwenn.

Have fun and enjoy a few hours with the Portwenn citizens!",1389398400,,786,4.695652173913044
6019335,4,B00FPPQYXM,"I received and watched the Series 6 of Doc Martin.  I love the Doc Martin shows,
but was somewhat disappointed in this one. Doc Martin was grouchy the whole time,
even on their wedding day.  He should have shown a little joy on that day.
And, why do you have the Louisa character show such childish behavior?  It didn't make sense
for her to ask the Doc to give out chlldren's awards when he had patients to see. She is not a
young squirt. Her anger and peevishness is just as bad as Doc's bad attitude.
I understand you have made him see the light and want to change. (Hope for the next series)
Another thing, the actors should put some color on their hair because they are aging too fast for
the story line.",1389398400,,709,4.237037037037037

series is sooo good.",1389398400,,297,4.303571428571429
6019341,4,B00FPPQYXM,"Glad to see a new season and hope the series will continue. We've watched the first 5 seasons several times and are glad to have added season 6. Doctor Ellingham is still Dr. Ellingham (if not more-so), Louisa is still Louisa even if now Mrs. Ellingham (but we'll miss Edith since Martin is now married). PC Penhale is a stitch as always. Mrs. Tishell is very conflicted - still. Other regular characters seem like old friends - Al, Bert, Aunt Ruth, Morwenna, James Henry (all of the James Henry's are cute;-), etc. Some new characters are being introduced and hope they stick around. The wedding and much of the honeymoon were great. The trip to the library was classic. But there seems to be more ""dark"" situations this season.

Two former characters are ""dead"" and one character I thought we'd never see again was back. Wish there had been more emphasis on the school-age kids like in previous seasons, but I enjoyed season 6, glad I own it and will watch it again several times. Most importantly, the last episode leaves LOTS of loose ends and situations that MUST be resolved in at LEAST one more season. Please. Can't wait!!",1389398400,6,1130,4.65
6019342,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Somehow several of the episodes didn't seem to be quite up to earlier series, but the first (of eight in this series) and the eighth were really great and as good as any in the earlier series.  Still our favorite English program.
Only complaint was that the box stated so many bonus minutes in addition to the minutes of Doc Martin.  The ""bonus minutes"" proved to be trailers for other shows.  Had to fast forward through them to get to Doc Martin.",1389398400,,448,4.439024390243903
6019343,5,B00FPPQYXM,"What can I say? Martin Clunes is outstanding and never cracks out of his character, never! Doc Martin quietly pushes his way through life insulting and bulldozing all the normal expectations of polite behaviour. In this new series, his life with Louisa and his son force him to develop empathy that he has never shown before! But the excitement never stops and he is always ready with a terse ""Shut up!' for patients, policemen, parents, anyone in his way. He does not suffer fools gladly, but we love him!",1389398400,,506,4.696629213483146

6019345,2,B00FPPQYXM,"I was somewhat disappointed with the series. Or, maybe it was what Amazon provided. Each episode seemed to be missing some important information needed to make the plot complete. After each episode I had the feeling I slept through some of the program! Maybe when it's shown on PBS it will be a complete program. Do I have to wait two more years to see the next season, or is this the end?",1389398400,2,389,4.342465753424658

If you're a fan of House you'll love this quirky show about a grumpy TO, in a little village full of rather unique people. The Doc is a genius, he can diagnose, many people with a glance. He is rude and can also alienate people with a glance. Then there is his love, Louisa who defends him around every corner. You have to feel for her, Martin is sometimes so clueless as how to talk to people he will insult them without knowing he's doing it. Martin Clune is amazing as Doc Martin I highly recommend this show. One of Britain's best!",1389398400,,593,4.2105263157894735

I was on the edge of my seat at points while watching #6 and at one point actually jumped when something very unexpected happened.  The producers do a great job at depicting a person close to death or not breathing.  It really looks real.

6019353,4,B00FPPQYXM,The first five seasons were outstanding.  This last season was still very good but had some lapses in story line that I did not care about though you still have to like the quirky characters in the show.,1389312000,,203,4.342105263157895
6019354,2,B00FPPQYXM,"My husband and I enjoyed Seasons 1-5 very much because the characters were quirky, lovable and laughable but Season 6 was not only boring, it was painful!  Poor Louisa was put through the wringer until it was unbearable.  We had such high hopes during the first episode but our great expectations were slowly, but surely, ground down to nothing with each painful episode.  No laughs at all.  I truly do not understand the 4 and 5 star ratings, especially the one that described it as 'light-hearted'; but in reading some of them, they sounded contrived, like maybe they were paid to write glowing reviews or maybe they were trying to get them to make more episodes since Martin Clunes said he would only consider more seasons if Season 6 was a success.
I had come up with the word 'gloomy' to describe season 6 in general but after reading some of the one to three star reviews, I agree with other descriptive words used such as 'tired', 'dull', and 'hopeless'.  I actually felt sorry for the actors to be in such a listless production.  We should have stopped watching at the end of Season 5's wonderful, happy ending.",1389312000,7,1119,4.626262626262626
6019355,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Finally married, but in typical fashion and with the normal mishaps.  The best thing about this episode is that Martin and Lousisa stay prefectly themselves, despite a honeymoon they'll never forget.  I laughed all the way through but its got its touching moments too.  You know they'll never have a boring life, but they were made for each other.",1389312000,,347,4.8474576271186445
6019356,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Better than ever!  The writing for this season is absolutely enjoyable.  With some series they seem to drag on and get to be same-old-same-old, but not season 6.  Martin and Louiser :) are now married and so new issues and challenges make for a whole lot of new fun.  Martin Clunes is brilliant as usual and there are a few new characters that fit perfectly.  If you're a Doc Martin fan, I think you'll not be disappointed.  If you're not a Doc Martin fan, what's wrong with you?  It's one of the best TV shows anywhere, anytime!!!",1389312000,,531,4.412371134020619

I don't usually buy TV videos but couldn't wait for series 6.
I think the writing in series 6, episode 1 was mediocre at best. From the time Martin and Louisa reached the caravan, it was all downhill.  I was surprised at the attempt at comedy, Louisa with the shotgun and Martin with his third fall. But the one thing that was really bothersome was Martin's tag-line, ""Oh, for God's sake"" given to the recluse.
The quality does get better as the episodes progress. Episode 8 is the expected cliffhanger. Kleenex alert.",1389312000,,637,4.6371681415929205

6019364,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Doc Martin Series 6 follows surgeon-turned-GP doctor, Martin Ellingham in the small fictional Cornish village of Portwenn. The doctor himself, played by the talented Martin Clunes, still hasn't adapted to life in the close knit community. Clunes captures the curmudgeonly spirit of the misplaced ""Doc"" to a T. His short retorts and general tactlessness elicit giggles without trying too hard. Series 6 does step away from the issues of the citizens of Portwenn and the doc's practice to focus more on Martin and his new status as a husband and a father.  Of course matters of the heart aren't easily expressed, but the silent pauses speak volumes -- more than loads of dialogue ever could. Clunes is absolutely perfect in the role.

Louisa (Caroline Catz), school headmistress, is Martin's polar opposite. They clash at every turn yet they are both likeable and it is easy to understand the frustrations they have with each other. Additonal supporting characters include officer PC Joe Penhale (aka British Barney Fife) played by John Marquez, as well as a kind-hearted but tough-as-nails, Dr. Ruth Ellingham (Eileen Atkins), and the plumber turned restaurateur, Bert Large (Ian McNeice). Somehow the doc's secretaries practice managers always end up being loud, quirky women and the latest, Morwenna Newcross (Jessica Ransom), makes for the perfect foil to the all business Martin. The brilliant, star-studded, supporting cast make this series complete.

Doc Martin is a light-hearted drama fitting for those who like British humor. If you don't mind the occasional peek at a boil or the drawing of blood, this series will pull you in and leave you in stitches (no pun intended). A word to the wise, don't watch the series at night unless you plan on waking the house with sounds of laughter! Simply put, Doc Martin is British TV at its finest.

6019371,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I found this season to  be a little tougher to watch than the previous five, as it was a little more intense, but all the elements that make Doc Martin great are in it so don't register that as a complaint. Truly one of my top two series of all time. Perfectly cast and set. The shows are good in order but honestly you can watch any one in any order and enjoy it. The absolute best of British humor, drama, and charm. Can't wait for another season! Bravo!!",1389139200,,457,4.134831460674158

6019380,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I found the previous season (series) of Doc Martin too angst laden with not enough humor, so was unsure if this show had perhaps ""jumped the shark.""  No worries, however:  Season 6 was one of the best yet, and moreover, left us at a place where I fully expect they'll make Season 7, and hope they'll keep making this show forever!

A few notes:  I find the chemistry between the actors playing Ruth Ellingham and Al Large so strong I almost wish they'd make them a couple--or maybe that she'd adopt him!  And in the behind-the-scenes piece, Martin Clunes continues to astonish with the way he becomes ""the Doc"" in a second when the cameras begin to roll.  He's just an amazing actor whom I never tire of watching.",1389139200,,713,4.488372093023256

There is no chemistry between Martin and Louisa and all the other characters are just bumbling along and not really doing anything.  My guess is that the writing is at fault.  Doc Martin has been my favorite series ever and it disappointed me this time.  We haven't watched the last episode yet but I have a hunch that the Doc has a sickness.  We all know what a great doctor he is and how he can diagnose something quickly so I'm wondering why he is sending out lab test vials and seems to be constantly checking his blood pressure and heart.  I hope there isn't something seriously wrong (physically) with him but we will find out tonight.
One week later and I am upgrading to 4 star (if I can.)  The final show did finish the season more like the other seasons.  We both thought it ended well and are looking forward to season 7.",1389052800,2,968,4.269230769230769
6019400,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Martin Clunes is marvelously gruff in this fun romp through England's Cornwall.  Filmed in Port Isaac, the fictional town of Portwenn plays host to Doctor Martin Ellingham's reluctant present as the town's GP.  Arriving from London as a renowned and accomplished surgeon, this particular GP has an open secret- he's terrified of blood, as it renders him violently sick at the sight of it.  Played for comedy-drama, Clunes is brilliant as the ""fish-out-of-water"" Doc Martin (as he's called by the locals, also well-played by the likes of Ian McNeice as the Bert Large, Joe Absolom as his son Al, and guest starring some of England's best), the gruff, blunt, and all-too-likable town's GP.  Showing not-too-thinly veiled contempt for the people who's medical needs he's charged with ministering, he navigates his new surroundings and challenges with dismissive rudeness, but always with the best medical care he can provide.  Which is substantial.  Just watch, and enjoy!",1389052800,,969,5.259740259740259

Like maybe they all feel like they should have quit at Season 5. The story line is pretty much the same. Cranky Doc Martin, as to be expected. Louisa surprised at his mannerisms, although she should know how he is by now. Bumbling Burt, broke as usual. Etc...

I'll probably watch the rest of the season in hopes of an interesting plot twist or character(s) development but I'm not overly optimistic, given I'm through episode 3 already.",1388966400,4,566,4.53921568627451

I wish there were more then 8 episodes this season and I wish there was another season to look forward too-- I can't help but root for Martin and Louisa.",1388880000,,405,4.4
6019419,5,B00FPPQYXM,"There is nothing that I dislike about this series except that there are only 8 episodes in the season. I cannot wait to see what happens about Doc Martin and Louisa's marital situation and relationship. It is all about communication and admitting we are all vulnerable in this life. The suffering occurs when we bottle it all up and don't admit that we need connections with others. His worsening fear of blood, his mother's unexpected visit, accidents and other situations is just so interesting and well written. This series has the right mix of humor and reality. I love it!",1388880000,,577,4.78

6019422,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Doc Martin has been a great series! It continues with this sixth season. In fact with the same actors and a couple of new ones, the stories are better than season five and that's saying something. I wish they wouldn't wait two years to bring out the new season but it was worth the wait as it turned out. The town of Port Wen is as beautiful as it's always been. My only dislike is that season six will come to an end. I hope I don't have to wait two more years for the next season.",1388880000,,482,3.979381443298969

6019431,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Love, love  loved every episode of this program from the  start to the last minute of  series 6.  Could they possibly make a 7th? Probably best to stop while it's still great, rather than watch it get way too silly.  Best series in a long time!",1388793600,,244,4.217391304347826
6019432,5,B00FPPQYXM,I love the Doc Martin series.  Martin Clunes is brilliant in it.  And Caroline Catz and all the cast  are great.  Sometimes I wish Martin would just give Louisa a hug and a kiss instead of a criticism about something.  But that's the Doc.,1388793600,,238,4.318181818181818

6019435,5,B00FPPQYXM,I think the Doc Marin series is comical with a sarcastic flare. The humor is clever too. Its a light hearted romantic comedy definitely worth watching. :),1388793600,,154,4.7407407407407405

6019445,4,B00FPPQYXM,"I was somewhat disappointed, but can't bring myself to give it only 3 stars. How about 3 1/2? Port Isaac (Wenn) was beautiful. The side stories were generally very good, as well as the supporting actors. the first story was enjoyable. It was nice to see Clair Bloom have a significant part. Caroline Catz is a fine actress. But I thought Martin Clunes' portrayal of Doc Martin was overdone. His character was just too flat and without much interest. I like Clunes very much, but perhaps he tried too hard to be the grumpy old Doc. I know he was trying to portray a man who is depressed and troubled. I suppose he did, but I thought it was so underplayed that it left the others to pick up the slack, and even Caroline had to struggle to relate. There was little to relate to Doc as opposed to past series. I also felt a bit ""used"" at the ending. Either they will leave us hanging with no ending, or we are being set up to wait another 2 years for ""Series 7"". And will that be more of the same? How long will they do this? I'm 67. Will I die first? I won't get the next series until I know more about it. I say give us some resolution. And if not, how about a more interesting Doc?",1388707200,8,1180,4.1347826086956525

Not to say that I shall not watch it again, after I watch Season 1-5; I just love him sooooo much, along with the variety of nuts who inhabit his life.  This season allows him & Louisa to settle in a bit......?  Great, good & wonderful...where is Season 7?",1388707200,,381,4.053333333333334
6019449,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Martin Cllunes, Caroline Catz and the rest of this cast are brilliant. The first episode was a tad over the top, but I still loved it.  Port Isaac, as Port Wenn, is a sight to behold!  Loved the scene where Al and Morwenna meet up on Cornish Singles dating service....we stayed in that hotel just a week or two after filming. It's the Longcross in Trelights, and is a lovely place to stay.  HAard to imagine anyone who would not enjoy this great series!",1388707200,,453,4.369047619047619

6019451,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I gave the 6th series to my wife for Christmas, and we spent several evenings watching the episodes and features.  There are a few twists in the love lives of characters we've grown to love.  The dreaded pharmacist, Mrs. Tishell returns, as does Martin's monster-mother.  I love his Aunt Ruth, who squares of and let's Martin's mother have it, full blast, right to her face.  Without spoiling the series for buyers, there is a very real looks at the severity of Martin's bitter childhood, and how wanting it to go away can't make it ""go away"".  Some good study of how to and how not to talk to a child.
5 stars, all the way.  I hope the series continues to develop.",1388707200,8,665,4.409836065573771

Plus the location photography is beautiful. Cornwall is one of my favorite places in the UK.",1388707200,,264,5.162790697674419
6019454,5,B00FPPQYXM,All the of Doc Martin is fun with characters that will feel like friends.  The scenery is beautiful & makes you want to go for a visit.  This is a Doc that in the end we probably wish was our own.,1388707200,,196,3.7560975609756095

6019458,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Never ,never have I enjoyed the Doc Martin series,more.  This character and the characters in this little
town make you laugh  and cry  with  their antics.  Doc. is a character you will love with his crankiness.  I don't want the series to end at Season  6.  Please keep it going... It  is the most entertaining tv show on
tv...",1388707200,,328,4.423728813559322
6019459,3,B00FPPQYXM,"I used to howl with laughter at every episode of Doc Martin.  The newest season, not so much. There is more sadness that does not turn into laughter.  His mother is a case in point; she is so cruel and self-involved you want to physically shake her, hurt her.  While this portrayal of his mother helps one understand why he is so emotionally wounded, it is not funny.  The psychotic pharmacist has also lost her edge; something about the writing does not work.  The actors carry their roles, but something is missing and it's too bad.",1388707200,3,534,4.520833333333333
6019460,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Season 6 is loaded with more quirky characters from Port Wenn and Doc's family.  Doc and Louisa face and sturggle with the problems of many new parents who have careers.
The cast usually take a break between season. So fans might have to wait 2 years for season 7.  Nothing has been scheduled yet.
Don't binge, watch and enjoy each episode.  Make it last, who knows when we'll know what happens next!",1388707200,,400,4.527777777777778

It is suspense-packed and a little sad, especially not knowing when and if the show will continue.  I highly recommend this and all of the Doc Martin series.  I forgot to mention in my review of Series 1-5 that a few movies upon which the series is based is included with that package.  I haven't watched them yet, so I still have something to look forward to as I await Series 7.  I highly recommend this wonderful show to anyone who loves dark British comedy laced with suspense and romance.",1388620800,,585,4.481132075471698

6019469,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Doc Martin Season 6 picks up where Season 5 left off. I watched one episode after another over two days--and enjoyed every minute. Quirky, snarky Doc Martin is back up to his old tricks--working medical miracles while leaving a wake of dazed and offended patients. His personal life takes center stage as he struggles to balance family with work and his social deficiencies. Funny, sweet. sad and wonderful!",1388620800,,407,5.0

6019471,5,B00FPPQYXM,Best show ever.  If you've never watched this show - catch up on Netflix - from the first episode you will get hooked.  My brother is cursing me as he's been getting no sleep due to binge watching this showfair warning - it's addictive.  It was going to end with Series 5 but Martin Clunes signed on for Series 6I'm hoping there's Series 7.,1388620800,,340,4.28125
6019472,2,B00FPPQYXM,I have loved the Doc Martin series ~ til now.  Series 6 is a major disappointment.  The writers have lost their touch or new writers don't have the talent to write like the earlier material.  Most of what makes many of us love this series and the characters in it is missing in Series 6.  The first episode was just plain dumb and the second not much better ~ and so it went.  I never ever thought I would get bored watching Doc Martin but I did. So so disappointing!,1388534400,7,467,4.144444444444445

6019475,5,B00FPPQYXM,"What can I say about Season 6 that won't let the cat out of the bag?  For you Doc Martin devotees out there, hes a bit older-looking, and seems unrelentingly grumpier and this season holds some alarming and unpleasant developments with a cliff-hanger at the end (Naturally!).  Youll have to get this season so that you can champ at the bit awaiting Season7. Certainly, if you're a devotee, you don't need my advice to order this.  Do it now, why wait any longer delaying the viewing pleasure?",1388534400,,492,4.632183908045977

6019477,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Season 6 has Doc Martin more grouchy and loveable than ever, and the support cast is still great. Bert's chin is larger, Constable Penhale more awkward, and Louisa is still putting up with the doc. The HD offering on Amazon (watched the earlier seasons on Netflix) makes viewing even more enjoyable, well worth the extra $1 per episode.",1388534400,,336,4.810344827586207

Season 1 thru 5 were better, I still like season 6 most of the actors are still in the show, a couple of new additions.
Don't get me wrong I still enjoy watching Doc Martin, maybe it's because Doc Martin is married now and has changed a little.",1388534400,,448,4.160919540229885

Married life is a bit different for Louisa and Martin; Martin's mother is hilarious/pathetic; and Al becomes the new love interest (I've been rootin' for Al for 6 seasons!) so I'm happy.  The new pharmacist is entertaining, and the medical emergencies continue to gross me out periodically.  It's just part of the package.

Series 6 brought back some of the melody and coherence of  the earlier series and Martin and Louisa regained their human appeal. But I still think Louisa's character has gone out of whack--it's time we see more of the reaching out to Martin, the maturity of understanding, that she had before-- the balance between that and her need  to feel he really loves her just isn't there so too often she comes across as silly and petulant--I mean, the guy is a mess, right? and she already knew that-- so let's move on! As usual, Penhale and Mrs Tishell bid fair to steal the show--they're inimitable.

This episode showed that the characters have definitely settled into each other more and it was hilarious and sweet.  I know I'm wishing for the impossible but I would love this series to continue forever!",1388275200,,377,4.769230769230769
6019497,4,B00FPPQYXM,"After viewing only the first episode of Series 6.........I think the Doc, logically, should be making at least some minor progress in becoming a more sensitive individual. More insight into his childhood and the lack of bonding with his parents could make for some interesting drama. Not that we want him to become a completely different person and lose his uniqueness, but it would be nice to have a bit of satisfaction in his losing some of his abrasiveness and becoming a father unlike the one who raised him. Shouldn't we see a little softening of his persona due to,  hopefully, his developing relationship with Louisa? I for one would consider the series to be less than satisfying if he always remains as incorrigible as the day he first arrived in Port Wenn.",1388275200,,766,4.7593984962406015
6019498,4,B00FPPQYXM,"While I enjoyed Series 6, there was less humor in this series.  There were a few high points, however, some of the episodes did not seem as well written as previous episodes.  My opinion is that if there is a series 7, Doc Martin should work very hard with a therapist.  Watching him try to be nice and very slowly getting it would be a lot of fun.  He needs to relax just enough so that he and Louisa can have something more than a two-dimensional relationship.  There would be a lot more room for humor and new types of frustration in such a series.  The townspeople of Port Wenn are wonderful and could have a series of their own. If you have not watched Doc Martin, you should start with series 1 and watch them all.  It is really top television.",1388275200,3,750,4.23943661971831

The late for the wedding followed by the honeymoon from hell all seemed a bit too forced, almost slapstick at times. The final episode was actually the best and it hints at a possible season 7. I hope so. It seemed overall that once Doc and Louisa got married the absurdity of their relationship was a bit too unreal. The final episode seems to hint at humanizing the character of Doc just a bit. I really hope there is a season 7!",1388275200,,600,4.2631578947368425

6019506,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Series six (6) of ""Doc Martin"", to me, had more of a serious ""tinge"" than the other five (5) series did.  Don't get me wrong, there were loads of humor supplied by the very eccentric inhabitants of the beautiful seaside village of Portwenn and by Doc Martin's total lack of ""bedside manners"" along with his unapologetic rude manner--why I love the series.  PLUS Mrs. Tishell (the pharmacist)  is back from the asylum.  However in Series six (6), Martin has far more to deal with such as the inconveniences of marriage and fatherhood plus his awful mother.  Series six (6) is wonderfully written, acted and directed.  I just love ""Doc Martin"" and do hope it continues.

Several of us who are fans work in a healthcare environment, and have occasional lunch sessions where we watch an episode and then talk about the doctor.  We all love Doc Martin and find him exasperating at the same time!  And while we don't actually know any of our colleagues that have quite the reaction he does to injury or illness, we do watch out for what could be called the ""Doc Martin syndrome.""  There are touching moments that make the viewer feel good, truly sad moments that will make one cry, and then some of the wildest bits one could ever imagine happening in a small village setting.....it is all part of the story.

6019520,5,B00FPPQYXM,We have been looking for this sixth season for over a year. There's just something about this awkward Doctor interacting with a wide variety of local characters that is very compelling.,1388016000,,185,5.0
6019521,4,B00FPPQYXM,"When I first sat down to write this review I was taken aback by the negative comments claiming the producers had ""jumped the shark"" or made major changes that ruined the show.  In reality Series 6 is simply a continuation of the story arc started with Series 5 and that apparently will continue with a future Series 7.  I'm not going to give anything away but suffice it to say Martin's domestic bliss hits a major bump in the road, and not in a particularly humorous way.  Anyone watching the previous episodes in chronological order would know that Martin is evolving from the one dimensional character we met in Series 1.  Not everyone will approve of the direction they've taken, but to assume the show would remain static was simply naive.  As in the previous series there's 8 episodes on 2 discs running about 45 minutes each, along with additional video of cast and crew talking about the series, themselves, and Port isaac.

Much like his American TV contemporary, Dr. House*, Martin was initially portrayed as an uncompromising loner who seemed totally out of his element as a village GP.  From the outset much of the hilarity stemmed from Martin's inept interactions with the odd assortment of patients who crossed his path.  Even though Clunes had been playing versions of this character for several years, the TV series was reaching for a larger audience and needed to establish Martin's quirky side before they could embark on the ensuing narrative of how he overcomes his problems.  It's my opinion that this is what Clunes had in mind all along and the first 3 series were setting the stage for the larger story now being played out.

Much of the criticism appears to come from those who would prefer to have that one dimensional character in a series of comedic vignettes and would probably consider any dramatic narrative to be a negative.  Again, the same criticism was leveled at ""House"" when they began to expand the character's personal history and found similar familial disfunction and early romantic failures.  Had Martin simply continued seeing wacky guest stars with odd complaints it would have soon devolved into a pastiche of itself.  One way or another Martin was going to move on, otherwise what would be the point of the show, that he was simply a pathetically unhappy character?  I think they've made some choices that have worked rather well and a few others that haven't.  The path they're on may not suit everyone but it's infinitely more interesting than just leaving him as a cranky, miserable village doctor.

Another criticism involved a couple recent cast changes.  These  were largely the result of the bi-annual production schedule and beyond the control of the producers.  All the actors, including Clunes, have other commitments and occasionally conflicts arise.  Unlike American television actors who usually devote their energies to a single role at a time, Brit actors commonly juggle multiple roles during the calender year due to the abbreviated number of new episodes UK television airs each season.  As a result cast changes are not that uncommon in UK productions.  Some shows roll on without a hitch while others fall from grace.  Examples abound, but popular UK shows such as Midsomer Murders, Foyle's War, and New Tricks have all had characters replaced or eliminated over the course of their run.  John Nettles had 3 different sergeants with little effect, though his own departure (along with his entire family) brought a slew of negative commentary.  Many fans of New Tricks feel the show has diminished in quality after cast changes, while Foyle's War carries the additional burden of doing without the backdrop of WW2 and moving only some of the original characters into the post war espionage series.  In ""Doc Martin"" both Stephanie Cole and Katherine Parkinson had other acting jobs and the Doc Martin producers had little choice but to replace their characters.

In conclusion, this set continues the story arc that began in Series 5 and ends with an unresolved episode which bodes well for a future Series 7**.  If you were expecting a return to the antics of the earliest episodes you'll probably be disappointed.  I personally thought this group to be the best of the entire series with truly excellent performances by just about every cast member (especially Claire Bloom's ongoing role at age 82 as Martin's hideous mother, and Caroline Catz's most compelling Louisa yet) but rated it with 4 stars to allow for the possibility that it might not suit all tastes.

*  Before anyone gets too worked up about one show stealing from another, both debuted in the fall of 2004 and both featured UK based actors of roughly similar background. The Martin character first appeared as Dr. Martin Bamford in the theatrical release ""Saving Grace"" and in two modest UK television movies in the early 2000's.  By all accounts the Gregory House character was drawn from the annals of Sherlock Holmes and owes much to Conan-Doyle's original characterization, including a penchant for self medication with narcotics.

**  Clunes stated in a recent UK television interview that the series will continue only as long as the ratings remain at a high level.  Despite the  beautiful production values this is an expensive show to produce with a large cast and crew encamped on location for a minimum of 8 weeks per season. Funding for new episodes has always been dicey as numerous less costly productions compete for slots on the network's schedule.  As with the cast changes future episodes are further complicated by the bi-annual schedule which means cast and crew won't know if they have a job for at least a year down the road, leading some to seek more near term employment which can complicate their availability if future episodes are ultimately scheduled.",1388016000,5,5811,4.941358024691358

It would be so very nice to see the Doc Martin, Louisa and James all together and making a real go of marriage.  That's what marriages are suppose to do - for better or for worse - right?

Make him the only GP in a picturesque Cornish seaport village, paint in a cast of accident-prone, loveably oddball locals and drum up a medical mystery or two and you have 'Doc Martin.' A relatively simple formula, yes, but when pulled off with such dramatic charm and depth as this series has, also a very good show (4 1/2 stars). Be warned, though: Season 6 is a little more schizophrenic in tone than those prior regarding the principals, now Dr. and Mrs. Ellingham, who run the gamut (and gauntlet) from moments of silly situational humor to soul-crushing personal and family crisis, the latter presented-- particularly in the last few episodes-- darkly and seemingly without resolution. Even having traded in some of its intrigue for pathos, however, the program maintains high marks as high-minded, warm-hearted entertainment. 4-plus stars.",1387497600,5,911,5.204081632653061

You can almost see a yearning in her eyes every time Martin starts to perhaps show some emotion, but then of-course he ruins it.  Martin will always be incapable to love anyone until he loves himself first and at the end of the 6th season there appears some hope for change!

6019564,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Doc Martin is a lovely series from season one to six you can always expect an awkward and misperceived Dr. Ellingham.  However, series six proves unsettling, stirring and shows Martin Clunes exceptional acting range better than in any of the other series.  Deeply and convincingly introspective and increasing lonely Dr. Martins transformation from the awkward grips of his narcissism and superiority to those in Portwenn into a man of softening conviction and bewilderment of his place in his new shared life.  Dr. Martin is now aware of his increasing introspection, detachment, and continues to make no excuses for his historical defects.  However, this season he settles quietly to look upon others now with a bit more acceptance than ever before.  Clunes proves that Dr. Martin can be exceedingly deep, detached, yet present and aware of his own character defects -- A great metamorphosis from Dr. Ellingham's ego.  Hes vulnerable and is so aware of his wildly abusive childhood that he steadfastly leaps on his mothers misfortune like a hungry lion without empathy for his prey.  His internal torture is palpable more so then in the other seasons.  All around Dr. Martin has become quieter, lonelier, yet more accepting of others but still separated from the pack with deliberate signs of strength and weakness.  Brilliant series  Im not sure if they should go another round or not, but I would watch another season for sure.",1387238400,10,1431,5.076923076923077

6019572,4,B00FPPQYXM,"Doc Martin is back and he hasn't changed a bit.

At the end of season five we saw Martin profess his love for Louisa.  I was looking forward to seeing season six with the hope that Martin had improved in sharing his life and feelings with Louisa.  I wasn't expecting miracles, just a gentle crack in his unfeeling faade, some kind of indication of Martin making an effort to reveal and share his feelings with Louisa.  The audience is shown glimpses of his love for her but he still withholds them from Louisa.

Episode one begins with Louisa's and Martin's wedding.  I was trying to figure out how much time was to have passed between the end of season five and the wedding.  The best I could come up with was six, possibly seven months? At one point, Louisa comments that James Henry, their son, is nine months old and I think he was eight weeks old when they finally named him at the end of season five.  The reason for my doing this was to help me understand how their relationship had progressed to the decision to marry.  I hoped that they had had enough time to work out their ""problems"" with Louisa being sure she could live with the Doc.  Their ""relationship"" had already ended disastrously twice.  Surely, Louisa knew what she was getting into?  Unfortunately, it became immediately clear on their honeymoon that Martin is the same ol' Martin.

Because of this, I spent the entire time I watched feeling sad and frustrated that it was more of the same old thing.  I guess I had gotten my hopes up for a sign of warming in Martin.  I understand how his overall demeanor could not be completely altered because that would take away from the premise of the show's original concept. Maybe, I had just forgotten how impossibly rude and well, mean, Martin was to everyone.  I kept wondering why in the world Louisa married him. It wasn't funny anymore.  The overall humor of the program had begun to wear thin for me in season five.

This installment brought more insight into the reasons for Martin being so detached and cold.  We meet his mother and his incredibly troubled childhood is elucidated even more.  Neither of his parents showed any interest in him at all.  Guess what?  They were cold and detached.  Sad.  The only light he had in his life was his Aunt Joan.  When his attachment to Joan was noticed by his father, (Joan's brother) he parted them. His father was a cruel man. I understand the emotional damage that Martin suffered and as a result how he closed himself off to feel nothing.  In doing this he insulated himself from hurt but sadly, this protective barrier also kept him from opening himself up to meaningful relationships. However, he has an obviously brilliant mind and cannot be ignorant about how his behavior toward and treatment of others resembles that of his parents toward him.  Surely he understands that if it was wrong for his parents to treat him thus then it is equally wrong for him to imitate them?  I don't mean to sound harsh but I just thought that the writer's had brought him to these conclusions at the end of season five?  It's time they write some progress into his condition.

The saving grace, for me, of this program is Portwenn and its citizens. The views! Oh, I want to go there!  What an absolutely gorgeous setting. Also, thank goodness for the quirky characters that are plentiful, which populate the small fishing community.  They are always good to Doc Martin even in the face of what I consider his cold and churlish behavior.  Anywhere else he might have been run out on a rail.

Returning is Bert and Al Large. For me, Al really shone. I'm delighted that his character took such a front row seat.  Aunt Ruth Ellingham returns and is absolutely marvelous, she seems to be able to reach Martin when no one else, including Louisa, can.  Mrs. Tishell returns from the mental institution where she was treated for her delusions, which led to her kidnapping James Henry.  Is she cured of her obsession with Martin?  Morwenna, the new receptionist, while she's not Pauline, she has her own kind of moxy.  I liked her.  She is given a possible love interest. The ever nice and somewhat daft PC Joe Penhale continues to reach out to Martin in friendship and continues to be rejected.  A wonderful addition is another love interest, for Bert! A particularly interesting thread in the episodes is a child-minder afflicted with OCD. He fits Martin's sensibilities of order but as you can imagine drives Louisa crazy.

The last two seasons my love for this series began to wane.  Martin made me so sad. His rudeness got on my nerves.  At the end of season five my hope was renewed that the story line would include some progress and improvement in Martin's desire and ability to relate to others. He could still be impatient but with a crack or two in his armor?  A sign of some softening?  Yet, once more we see Martin coldly shutting Louisa out and by the final episode is saying, to Ruth (not Louisa) that he wants to change.  The cliffhanger is...will he?

I give this season four stars.  The supporting cast saved it for me.",1387065600,5,5085,4.5842572062084255
6019573,5,B00FPPQYXM,"This season is not funny. I don't think it's meant to be. What we see is the sadness in the characters' lives. In no particular order: Martin and Louisa can't figure out how to live with each other. Penhall is more aware of how silly he is, and that makes him sad rather than slapstick funny. The OCD nanny Martin hires turns out to be AWOL from the army and turns himself in. Martin's father dies and he doesn't learn until 2 weeks later.

I don't think the show suffers from this, because this sadness has always run under the surface of the comedy. Maybe it needed to be aired more fully if the show were to avoid becoming tired. I do think it runs the risk of becoming a soap opera now, but probably a much better one than Downton Abbey.",1387065600,,741,4.21830985915493

I was so enthralled and thrilled at the final episode.  All of the plateaus of former seasons were reached and then some.  I just have to say to the writers, producers actors and the entire crew who made this wonderful project possible, thank you and I hope you can make it all go on for at least another season.  I am hooked on this show and don't believe that in my 53 years, have ever enjoyed any television as much as this program.  Thank you all so much!!!",1386979200,2,638,4.188524590163935
6019578,4,B00FPPQYXM,"First, allow me to say that I personally love the Doc Martin Series.  I have viewed them all at least 3 times.  Series 5 ended well and with hope that Louisa and Martin might actually connect. So, Series 6 presents a very different Martin.  Very stiff and nervous at his wedding (understandable for him), he continues to decompensate into himself.  After all the self awareness he exhibited at the end of Series 5, it was very strange to see him so cold only 2 weeks after his wedding.  No kisses, no kind pats, no talk of the night before being good or great...nothing.  Louisa seems to try, but again runs away from him, thus confirming his fears of inadequacy. It is frustrating for me because there are no insights into Martin, via flashbacks or conversations.  His very frigid mother (Clare Bloom who is terrific) shows up and Louisa just lets it happen. The audience is supposed to surmise the reasons why Martin is so isolated.  Near the end of show 7, he looks as if he getting catatonic.  I like the way the writers have included more time to the other characters.  Aunty Ruth is really good this series, (as opposed to series 5 when she looked out of sorts and uncomfortable.)  Al and Aunt Ruth have very good scenes.  Bert needs to loose some serious weight or he may not be back for Series 7.  I saw him mouth breathing in the manner of a COPD patient.  He seems truly seriously in trouble.  Louisa, my favorite character, is not so perfect as she is portrayed.  She leaves when things get tough, even though the man she has recently married has some very obvious problems.  Finally at the airport, she confronts Martin's mother about her not telling him that his father has died.  That reminded me of the old Louisa in Series 1 when she told the young doctor off about spreading stories about Martin. Louisa's mother ran away.  I wonder when the writers will allow Louisa to make the connection that she just can't run away from life. This series is written following the old formula:  Martin is a dick, Louisa gets hurt and mad, Louisa leaves, Martin has an awakening (cries, pouts, whatever) runs after Louisa and saves her.  This time, though, Louisa missed the boat entirely.  She needed to tell her husband that whatever is the problem, they could work it out as man and wife because she loves him.  There are so many other possibilities with all the wonderful characters in this series, that the ""old formula is not necessary.""",1386979200,11,2446,4.585253456221198

6019593,5,B00FPPQYXM,"Currently one of the best humor/drama series out of Britain. A top show due to quirky characters portrayed by excellent acting. The writing is excellent, providing every episode with a collection of plot threads that incorporate the entire populace of fun-loving ocean-side villagers. You'll laugh at everyone from street girls to the related pair of Doctors.
Doc Martin's romance with Louise who runs the local school has always been tense, funny, and part of the ongoing main plot. Martin Clunes and Caroline Catz lead every great episode, but numerous side situations keep the story fast-pace and emotion scrambled. The perfect cast for this oddball mix of villagers is the driving force behind why this is a modern classic series. They even throw in guest stars. I own every series, and will always get the next.

SDH SUBTITLES for all 8 episodes.

6019597,5,B00FPPQYXM,"I love this whole series.  I was put onto the series this year by my brother and was hooked from first one.  It's maddening, heartwarming, funny and so very English humor.  Doc Martin at times you want to hate him and then he does something that makes you like him a bit more.  His love hate realtionship with his girlfriend, the local constable and receptionist is classic. He has some very interesting patients , all so lovable at times.  I've watched the series twice and it's something you'll watch over and over and if you have those people in your life who love good TV, this is the series for you.",1384473600,78,604,4.405405405405405

8617733,5,B00FPPQYXM,"This show is hilarious, brimming with characters we all recognize from our own friends, neighbors, and acquaintances. I've become hooked on the show, immersed in the scenery, experiences, and exploits of every episode. I can't stop watching. I must admit that I've fallen in love with Doc Martin, the show and the character, so the final episode of Season 6 brought me to tears watching as he silently dealt with rejection by the most important person in his life (other than James). Netflix ends the show with Season 6 so imagine my devastation at the prospect of not being able to continue my binge. Alas, I have Roku and the ability to add the Acorn TV channel. The binge continues with Seasos 7 and 8.",1518480000,,705,4.648
