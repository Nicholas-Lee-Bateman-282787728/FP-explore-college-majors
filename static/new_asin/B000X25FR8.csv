Nadie te querr como yo (1972) is about a young, carefree woman, Isabel (Hilda Aguirre), who lives with her stern paternalistic father who wants her to marry a respectable, young upper middle class childhood friend. Isabel thinks he is boring and wants to do her own things. She further infuriates her stern father when she decides to devote herself to the nunnery. Her open minded grandmother (Sara Garcia) tells her to follow her heart. She also has a rather odd and liberal aunt, who always is talking about her writing. Isabel (Hilda Aguirre), also startles the Mother Superior by singing songs for coins and she also wants to setup social welfare programs.

In the city, there are also a bunch of young male loafers who play pool and smoke all day, talking about the rich or the uselessness of life. Javier (Andrs Garcia) is included here, he's lazy, lethargic and has no goals. There's also a song sung by one of them with a guitar. Javier (Andrs Garcia) is walking one day when he sees Isabel (Hilda Aguirre) before she is going to the nunnery, driving by in a car. He thinks about her from that point on.

One day, Isabel (Hilda Aguirre), is singing a song while riding on her bicycle along the forest road. Javier (Andrs Garcia) is also walking in a daze, and starts to harass her, stealing her bicycle and out of nowhere, rapes her.  It was extremely done, without provocation and is a really unexpected scene.

Isabel (Hilda Aguirre) does not contact the police after the rape, but informs her Mother Superior at the nunnery, who wants to hide her away and give the baby to a family. Isabel does not want to do that and quits the nunnery. She moves back to her family, but can not stay for long because of her stern paternalistic father, who wants to hide her in the room and give the baby away. She breaks with her father and moves with her liberal aunt.

Isabel (Hilda Aguirre) then finds Javier (Andrs Garcia) at places in the town, at his work, or walking, and only smiles to him. He becomes embarrassed and runs away each time, but then confronts her, telling her that he is ""useless and mean"". ""Call the police if you want,"" he tells her. She tells him that she only wants him for a father of the baby because she sees kindness in him.

Isabel (Hilda Aguirre) has to ultimately marry the young upper middle class childhood friend, and they are at the church with their families for a wedding.

Eventually on that same day, Javier (Andrs Garcia) decides to leave the town and is awaiting the train at the station, when a ragamuffin child asks for some money. He tells him that he doesn't know his father. That leads Javier (Andrs Garcia) to have a change of heart and he quickly runs to the church where Isabel (Hilda Aguirre) is at the altar and calls out to her and they run away together laughing. Happy music is played.

I thought the subject was handled rather strangely, since a rape is a serious thing and Isabel (Hilda Aguirre) wants to marry her attacker without even knowing him. Still, it was a nice little low budget Mexican film.

Andrs Garcia (Chanoc (1967), Tintorera: Killer Shark (1977), Manaos (1979)) didn't have much to do, but he reminds me a bit of Paul Newman. Sara Garca was a Mexican actress from the ""Golden Age of Mexican cinema"". Hilda Aguirre (La hermanita Dinamita (1970)) was also fine to watch.
