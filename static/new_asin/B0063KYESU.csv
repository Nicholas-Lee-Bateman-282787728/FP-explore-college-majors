4944024,5,B0063KYESU,"On December 7th, the Japanese attacked the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor.  In this well-done program, the events of December 7-8 1941 are examined.

First of all, as noted in the program, information traveled much slower 70 years ago than it does now, so it was hours later before FDR began to fully understand how damaging the attack really was.  Panic gripped the White House.  FDR believed that the Pearl Harbor attack was the precursor to a Japanese invasion of the Hawaiian islands.  Our military, grossly underfunded and undermanned for years, was now thrust directly into war.  Interestingly, there was an America First rally going on in Pennsylvania while the attack was going on, but the speaker refused to believe that it was real.

Several interesting facts about FDR are brought up in the film.  For instance, FDR was suffering from nasal congestion while preparing his speech to be delivered to Congress on December 8th.  Since no antibiotics were available, FDR was given cocaine to shrink the swelling of his sinuses.  FDR also had to wear leg braces due to Polio.  The documentary shows how FDR's assistant had to put the braces on his legs; a process which took 30 minutes.  Then, FDR had to walk into the Senate chamber to deliver his now famous ""Date Which Will Live in Infamy"" speech.  He had great fear of falling while walking to the podium.

The attention paid to FDR's speech was very interesting to me.  Many of FDR's cabinet, especially Cordell Hull, wanted FDR to give a long speech, explaining in great detail the losses incurred at Pearl Harbor.  FDR wanted to deliver a shorter speech which would galvanize the nation.  FDR delivered the shorter speech, and it has become one of the most recognizable speeches in American history.

I've read books on Pearl Harbor for over twenty years, and I've seen numerous documentaries as well, and this documentary is one of the best I've seen.  Relying on input from history professors and other scholars, this program delves into that first 24 hours of war for the Americans.  Not to be forgotten are Churchill's impact on events and Douglas MacArthur's fateful blunders in the Philippines.

I highly recommend this fine program.  If you're interested in learning about the events immediately after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, then don't miss ""Pearl Harbor: 24 Hours After"".",1355875200,5,2359,4.9189873417721515
4944025,5,B0063KYESU,"I have read everything concerning Pearl Harbor and every December 7th we watch Tora Tora Tora. Last December the History Channel showed Pearl Harbor, 24 hrs after,I was totally taken aback. Who ever thinks about what truly happens within the first 24 hrs of anything. Even, if you think about it, do we really know what happened in the first 24 hrs after nine eleven? I thought I knew everything there was to know about the bombing of Pearl and the after effects. This has opened my eyes to new information,and to do new research. So, yes, this is a must movie to watch after Tora Tora Tora. And don't keep this to yourself, let everyone know about the 24 hrs after, anything. Keep history alive.",1355702400,,696,4.531746031746032
4944026,5,B0063KYESU,This captured an entirely different view on declaring war in 1941. It shows what makes a pivotal leader. I will be using this to meet several learning targets in my classroom.,1349740800,4,175,4.67741935483871
4944027,1,B0063KYESU,"The program is sadly misleading. The facts, quite clear now to informed people, are that FDR worked to provoke the Japanese into declaring war. One has to go back to August, 1941 when he met Churchill at Placentia Bay. Churchill risked crossing the Atlantic since he was bent on bringing the US into the war. Stalin was in full retreat before Hitler's invasion and it was almost certain that Hitler would be in Moscow by Christmas. If Russia were taken out of the war it would be curtains for the UK. Hence Churchill convinced FDR he had to bring the US into the war. The only way this could be done, given the anti-war sentiment in the US, was to provoke an attack that would cause a 180 degree change in US opinion. So FDR went back to Washington and told the navy to create a plan to provoke Japan into an attack. This was centered on the US shutting off US oil that Japan needed for its war effort. By December this was successful and Japan had determined that it was going to have to invade the Dutch East Indies (lots of oil there) and to do this it needed to neutralize the US fleet that could cut its communications with the East Indies. Roosevelt knew this was in the works and made sure that the the military in Pearl Harbor were kept in the dark about what was about to happen. So when the attack took place it was no surprise to FDR and a great relief to Churchill. This is all spelled out in various books by excellent historians that are ignored by this misleading program. One presumes one still can't tell Americans the truth about Pearl Harbor. PS FDR was completely justified in his scheme since otherwise the UK would have had to surrender to Hitler. FDR's provoking Japan into the attack was the right thing to do. But to try to claim that it took FDR by surprise is silly nonsense, reflected in this deceptive program.",1345248000,,1839,4.395894428152492

4944040,4,B0063KYESU,"Very educational for middle teens on up. Knowledge of our history (good and bad) as a society helps us advance and hopefully know better than to repeat our worst mistakes. It's unfortunate that so many young adults here in the U.S. and worldwide believe that WW II and the many atrocities committed by Japan and Hitler's Nazis never could have happened, despite what their parents and grandparents say.",1420848000,,402,4.926470588235294
4944041,5,B0063KYESU,"Its amazing how umprepared we were for the attack by Japan, and how quickly a united nation can respond. In June 1942 only seven months after the attack , at the Batt;e pf Midway we got our revenge. After Midway, the Japanese were on the defensive until the end of the war.",1416614400,,273,4.269230769230769
4944042,5,B0063KYESU,I have seen this program on The History Channel and found it very interesting in everyway. The new information shows over the years how  at the time of the attack panic on Pearl Harbor there  would be at a high level panic for  everyone. I am glad that President Roosevelt did not change his speech to Congress,1410480000,,310,4.4035087719298245

4944045,5,B0063KYESU,"Absolutely loved this film for myself as a total history nerd, but worked really well with my high school students as well. Covers different perspectives in the 24 hours afterwards, and demonstrates how chaotic things were and how information was so hard to come by - something which students today wouldn't think of. Will definitely be showing this again in the future.",1368576000,,370,4.983870967741935
4944046,5,B0063KYESU,Only the bombing of the World Trade Centers and the Pentagon had the impact of Pearl Harbor.  Particularly impressive is the response of President Roosevelt and his determination to WALK  to the podium where he would ask the joint houses of Congress for a declaration of war.
