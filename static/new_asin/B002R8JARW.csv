8378490,5,B002R8JARW,I've got the girls version of this - Jingle Belles - and have seen clips of this one.  They are both hilarious - great for the background at your holiday party (or if you're lonely on Christmas Eve :-)).  I tell people about them all of the time.,1256601600,,246,4.104166666666667
8378491,5,B002R8JARW,"I was not expecting much, but this is not only perfect for a bachelorette party I'm throwing soon, but it's also got a regular fireplace feature without the boys for my home (don't exactly want the kids to see these boys prancing around).  The guys on this are HOTTTT.  And they are not in the yule log screen every second--instead, they come in from time to time with gifts.  So funny!  I'm getting my husband the girls' version.",1256083200,,430,4.4743589743589745
8378492,5,B002R8JARW,"This DVD is great!  It is a new take on the traditional fireplace DVD - except here, there are some really great looking guys involved!  The guys come in and out and add a log here and there, sit and have a glass of wine, and walk by with Christmas presents.

I had it on during a wine club night with my girlfriends, and everybody loved it.  We chose the option not to use the Christmas music and just used the crackling noises (although we'll be turning the Christmas music back on for our Christmas party!)

The guys are in excellent shape and look really good!  I think my gay friends would like it too.  Also, the DVD isn't lewd or sexual -- it's very classy and well done.

I would definitely suggest it as a novelty gift for the Christmas season this year.",1254873600,,763,4.25
