The fun seeing the different types of personalities that clashes on a regular bases will keep you in stitches. I never new that British tv could be so great. Every night when they were shown on PBS this show was first, Keeping up Appearance was next. Certain days they would show ""AS TIME GOES BY"", Vicar Of Dibley, Police comedy starring the man who played Mr. Bean, The elderly couple show ""Waiting to die"", Then the show about the dentist and the crazy kids. I like Ms. Marble,Ms. Fischer, Mr. Pigeon other detective stories and my latest love ""The D ABBEY""",1386547200,,725,4.458646616541353

7824847,5,6302359708,"If you're a newcomer to ""Are You Being Served,"" this is an excellent start. If you're already a fan, you should recognize these titles immediately. It has three of the early episodes including one of my favorites, ""Big Brother."" I bet I've seen some of the AYBS episodes 100 times or more and never tire of them. This is downright silly comedy that never outdates itself. Highly recommended.",1209168000,,391,4.764705882352941
7824848,5,6302359708,"""Are You Being Served?"" is a great British sitcom that found a new life on PBS here in the U.S. It isn't as easy to find as it used to be, though. Fortunately, some of the shows are now available on video. As with many of our own classic sitcoms, this one brings together a wonderful ensemble of quirky characters. The venue is Grace Bros. Department Store and the characters comprise the staffs of the mens and womens counters and their supervisors.
As with any series, each viewer will choose his/her own favorite episodes. IMO, the episodes on Volume 1 in this series were all excellent and that video is a great one to start with if you're new to the shenanigans that go on at Grace Bros. This collection, Volume 2, is definitely a worthy follow-up. These three episodes are as funny as those on the first tape and give the new viewer a solid grounding in the zany group dynamic that runs through the entire series.
As near as I can determine, the producers of ""Are You Being Served?"" have released just seven tapes of three episodes each. Why they haven't simply released all of the episodes in order as they were originally shown is beyond me, but so far these 21 are all you can get (along with an eighth video made up of clips loosely strung together). We can only hope that all of the episodes will be made available in the future.
This is really funny stuff, and I highly recommend this video and its predecessor to anybody looking for a good laugh. I love this series and know several other folks who feel the same. Pay a visit to Grace Brothers, you'll enjoy the experience.",1010966400,3,1586,4.453608247422681
