3652453,5,B001J66JZ4,"Robert was a funny kid, and has a compelling life story. His comedy is just one aspect of real person. The mischievous kid, the short military career, the musician, the son, brother and friend... the tragic end. You should help fund this documentary - [...]",1358467200,,257,4.733333333333333
3652454,5,B001J66JZ4,"What can I say....This was one of, if not the funniest sets I have seen Robert Schimmel do on DVD. My ribs ached afterwards, & at times I found it hard to breathe from laughter. He is a master of stand-up & I found it very uplifting too. Go get it now!",1266105600,,252,3.8653846153846154

3652456,4,B001J66JZ4,Good video of some of his funny moments. I have seen him in person four or so times. This is not his best performance but funny none the less. Definitely worth the purchase.,1260057600,,173,4.2727272727272725
3652457,5,B001J66JZ4,"I just watched this the other night.  I laughed so hard, well, you know how the sentence ends!  I hope he plays live in my neighborhood, because I'm going.
This is comedy at it's best!  He talks about real life and topics that many can relate to!
Get a group of your friends together for this viewing!  You'll all be wailing!!!  This is just hillarious.",1241740800,,353,4.369230769230769
3652458,5,B001J66JZ4,"Not since George Carlin has there been a comedian of this caliber.  Although this DVD isn't as good as his previous ""Unprotected"" DVD, it's damn close.  His humor is a bit racy, but if you're not bothered by that style, this is definitely something to check out.",1241136000,,262,4.553191489361702
3652459,5,B001J66JZ4,"After hearing Robert on the Bob and Tom show, I decided to give him a try.  I love this dvd, even after watching it for the third time today.  He is a little raunchy, but it is true funny.  I would not buy it for your parents, but yes by all means share it with your adult children.  Robert's story is one of inspiration, and reminds us like he says everyone gets into the storm, it is those that choose to dance in the rain that survive.  BUY this DVD!!!!",1234656000,5,456,4.022222222222222
3652460,5,B001J66JZ4,"I was fortunate enough to see this DVD yesterday and I just wanted to say, somehow Robert gets FUNNIER as time goes by.

""Robert Schimmel: Life Since Then"" goes off the scale for FUNNY.

Has a lot of great extras, too!

If you want to laugh till you practically DIE, get this DVD!  :-)

3652461,5,B001J66JZ4,"Great to have Robert Schimmel back! He is blue...and dirty and driven by sexual desire and able to express it in the most funny and original way. Schimmel faced cancer 8 years ago and is back to pick up where he left off with his gut splitting takes on marriage , divorce and sexual mores. Schimmel hits all the right notes for the adult viewer/listener and even manages to be a bit serious and heartfelt at times.  The bonus 20 minute deli interview is a big plus as is the short 5 minute making of.",1231891200,7,500,4.2631578947368425
