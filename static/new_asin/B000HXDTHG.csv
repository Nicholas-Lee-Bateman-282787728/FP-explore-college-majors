8363931,5,B000HXDTHG,"While the description says it's in English, it's not. Therefore make sure you have the subtitles turned on. The acting is pretty good, the storyline engaging, the drama enough to keep you hooked. Definitely Good enough to Ignore the need to read, while I might not watch it again because of that part, you never know, I just might if I can't find anything else when the mood strikes me. :)",1506988800,,389,4.492957746478873
8363932,4,B000HXDTHG,"I was in the Philippines for two years in the late sixties and was regaled, several times, with stories of the ""White Lady"". At the small base near San Miguel, there were watch towers. A marine was admitted to the infirmary with a broken leg and the story he told was quite interesting. It seems that a woman, dressed in white, began climbing the tower in which he was keeping watch. After repeatedly warning her as she climbed, he opened fire with his M-16, emptying the magazine. The woman continued to climb, apparently unphased by the hail of bullets. He jumped from the tower and broke his leg.",1506816000,4,599,4.555555555555555
