1341279,5,B00004R8UO,I was very impressed with the service of this company and I would purchase from them again.  Thanks So Much!!,1250726400,3,109,4.45
1341280,5,B00004R8UO,"My older children used to watch these shows on TV. Then they stopped broadcasting the show. Every home, in fact every elementary school should have and use a copy of these stories. Each story has a character building theme and stories from many cultures and religious traditions to convey those messages. There has never been a more critical time than now for  children to learn about character.",1239580800,17,395,4.895522388059701
1341281,1,B00004R8UO,"I loved watching Adventures from the Book of Virtues growing up, and was excited that episodes were finally available on DVD (I have many episodes on VHS).  But I was incredibly disappointed to find that the voices have been changed on these DVDs!  No character sounds the same as they did in the show's original airing.  I compared my old VHS to the DVDs and the voices are completely different, even the guest stars.  I checked the end credits of the episodes, and the voice talents listed on the DVDs are completely different from those on my VHS tapes, which were the same as the ones I recognized from their original airings on TV.  Why this show was redubbed, I don't know, but I find it very jarring to listen to.  I'll be sticking with my old VHS tapes until a better DVD release than this comes along.

It's a great show, and for kids who've never seen the original, they'll never know the difference and I highly recommend the show, but for old fans and collectors, save your money unless you don't mind voice changes.",1224460800,35,1028,4.494623655913978
1341282,5,B00004R8UO,"I love this series!  I bought it for our six-year old daughter to teach her about virtues which are hard to come by in today's society.  She loves them and watches them over and over.  A great alternative to all the ""junk"" our children watch today.",1223856000,15,248,4.3478260869565215
1341283,5,B00004R8UO,I bought this to hopeful use some for guidance lessons. I loved this tv show as a child and can't wait to use with my students. I have watched a couple episodes already. :),1395964800,,172,4.088235294117647
1341284,5,B00004R8UO,"It's so hard to compete with the cultural garbage surrounding our kids nowadays. These wonderful cartoons are a good antidote. My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter loves them and they even help calm her when she is having a meltdown. I remember some of the stories from my childhood and it's great to be able to share them. If you have kids or grand kids, get this series!",1393977600,,367,4.411764705882353
1341285,3,B00004R8UO,This turned out to be a little more religious than I had bargained for.  At least the one I bought.  Too preachy.,1393372800,,113,4.090909090909091
1341286,5,B00004R8UO,"This collection of stories is invaluable.  It helps teach children about developing positive virtues like honestly, reliability, friendship while at the same time using scenes from history to reinforce the lesson being taught.  I'd recommend this to every family who values positive virtues.",1375574400,3,291,5.744186046511628

1341288,5,B00004R8UO,I watched these on PBS in the '90's when I was a kid I was really excited to find them on DVD to share with my nieces and nephew. They teach great moral lessons in a fun and memorable way.,1361232000,2,188,3.725
1341289,5,B00004R8UO,"I have purchased all of the episodes of the ""Book of Virtues"" series for my niece & nephew (4 & 7 yrs).  They love them and watch their 'learning shows' repeatedly.  My sis said it gives them a calming & loving message.  Enjoy...",1349827200,3,229,4.27906976744186

1341295,1,B00004R8UO,"So I am a super fan of the book of virtues. I try to tell the stories to my little girl. I bought this set to try to do it in a television format. First of all I understand it was developed in the 90's so I'll give them grace for the ""transformer"" type of animation. But then I put in the faith dvd, and after the comical intro I see a little girl crying. And the very first thing is ""I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S DEAD"". Now I understand some elements of faith will speak to life after death, death, etc. But I wasn't willing to have that conversation with my daughter at that point. Realistically they could have picked some different elements to teach the virtues. I quickly went to menu and went to the next one. And it started with someone's house being burnt down, and the kid saying ""its not my problem."" Which was their way of going into the story of the good sumaritan. Which I think is a great story... until I realized that with what I had just seen with the fire... that it could be that we see the Jew dad getting beaten and robbed on his way to summaria.

In the book of virtues... the author uses the forward to say sometimes in order to illustrate virtues, you have to expose the vice. The vice is clearly exposed in these videos, and because of the unthoughtful presentation and my own feeling of being slimed... I gave this set of videos a bad review. Maybe this is more of a PG-13 show (if you can get them to watch it, which i think they would have more self respect.)",1347321600,,1480,4.174825174825175
1341296,5,B00004R8UO,"While some of these episodes force you to confront moral choices, the reality is that children today face such choices daily (just read the newspaper). These are outstanding videos that tell stories from both ancient western and eastern civilization presented in a throughly modern manner. Outstanding product!",1336780800,6,310,5.617021276595745
1341297,1,B00004R8UO,"I sure hope that this product is different from the one I have been watching on Netflix. In episode 2 titled Honesty, there is the story of the ""Indian Cinderella"". In it, two older sisters put on scary masks and attack their sleeping younger sister with a hunting knife, slashing at her hair violently. They then force her out of her bed at knifepoint and it is implied that they burn her face on hot coals to disfigure her so she would not be considered as a bride for a warrior.. I fell off my couch trying to turn it off before my child saw anything. I understand the importance of a good lesson but really, is it worth that level of graphic and implied violence in a child's show?",1334016000,8,685,4.276923076923077
1341298,3,B00004R8UO,"My kids (ages 9 and down to toddler) seem to enjoy this series...some.  As adults, my husband and I find it sort of painful and tedius to watch them with them.  The plots are somewhat ""flat,"" predictable, and not very interesting...for us.  As I said, my kids watch them.  But they don't go back to them over and over as they do with some other shows.  Not great.",1332288000,,363,4.279411764705882
1341299,5,B00004R8UO,"My boys are 7 and 9, and they love this video.  It is a nice break from some of the ""stuff"" they see on TV.  It uses humor, but the lessons are quite clear.",1309651200,,156,3.5588235294117645
1341300,5,B00004R8UO,"it is nice to find children's movies that teach them values and helps them learn to be better people instead of all the violence and negativity that is portrayed in other children's movies.  i feel they don't need any help in that department, but in how to be a better person and get along with people.  My kids (ages 2-5) love these movies.  Highly recommended.",1266192000,6,362,4.538461538461538

'Adventures from the book of Virtues' is no exception! I love it. The beautiful messages and thoughtful lessons are a must for children then and should be now. Children today need shows like these instead the garbage that's out there now. I love Aurora's voice and the animation is perfect.

1341302,5,B00004R8UO,"These are amazing stories that help reinforce values that are positive for our children to learn.  I was disappointed though that there were only 8 virtues in the boxed set.  I had taped the series on PBS long ago and I can safely say that there are over 20 different virtues presented in the series and I was expecting the set.  That said, I would highly recommend this boxed set as a great starter set and look for further releases on DVD.",1255824000,28,441,4.353658536585366

Though it's not graphic and is, of course, true to the original tale, my son became very upset when we watched it.  I'm not writing this as a complaint about the episode or series, just to warn other parents of young or sensitive children who might react the same way.",1486080000,2,434,4.538461538461538
