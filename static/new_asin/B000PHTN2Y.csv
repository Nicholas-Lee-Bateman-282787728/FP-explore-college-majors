8191412,5,B000PHTN2Y,Excellent film! Love it! Next to zero nudity. No sex. Still most of the content is not suitable for most audiences. An excellent script indeed!!,1481587200,,144,4.8

Depressed and looking for a way to get over what happened, he goes to his best friend Tommy, a loud-mouthed movie producer for help.

Tommy gets the idea that they take a trip south of the border for the weekend to see what interesting drugs they can do and how many Mexican girls they can get laid with. Brady agrees and off they go! Things start out pretty wild for the most part but things take a turn for the worst when they meet 2 girls who aren't what they seem to be, who drug them and hold them captive in a seedy, deserted motel room. Brady's birthday becomes a living nightmare when it's discovered that the 2 women are associated with one of the most dangerous drug cartels in Mexico and holding them both for a ransom. With time steadily ticking, Brady with Tommy will have to find a way to escape and make it back across the border or it may just be the last birthday he lives to celebrate",1479945600,,1062,4.231527093596059
8191414,5,B000PHTN2Y,"This film grabbed me by the ***** and never let go for the whole ride! Somebody should give this director mega millions to make movies forever. In fact, he should do a remake of Gremlins! And Steven's certainly going to be nominated for Best Supporting Actor - no doubt about it.

Bonus: This movie doubles as an entertaining film AND a do-it-yourself guide to the best birthday present you could ever give a friend, too.",1478217600,,421,4.613333333333333
8191415,1,B000PHTN2Y,"You have got to be kidding me.  What a picec of crap.  Can I give it a -5 stars? This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Stupid, ridiculous photography, ugly untalented actors.  You name it, it is soooo bad.  Give me my money back.",1358553600,2,233,4.0
8191416,5,B000PHTN2Y,"This movie gave me a lot of mixed emotions, about this psychedelic thrill ride of a man's trip in hell.  Creepy, yet turned on from beginning to end.  Can't believe these artist came together and made this movie work from beginning to the end.  The Actors weren't doing it for the money, but for the love of film making, and that made it worth every penny I paid for the DVD. The music rocked, editing better than some movies I've seen lately, and the vision of the movie had a message.  Death and the trip you take going to the other side is a tricky situation.  Grade A quality product, clear audio, sound great, all in all...  It's a keeper.",1357603200,,644,4.325
8191417,2,B000PHTN2Y,"I would like to rate this higher than 2 stars, but I couldn't hear half of it.  The producers need to work on their sound recording technique.  It was still a great movie, though, I watched it all the way through, even though I missed half of the dialogue, because it was captivating and different.  I found the visual effects distracting, at first, but I started liking them after a few minutes, because they really added to the other-worldly aspect of the film.  It is worth the rental price, and to tell you the truth, I hope these guys make more horror movies, because I think they have something interesting to say, and they really add something unique to the genre.",1354060800,2,671,4.520661157024794
8191418,5,B000PHTN2Y,"I thought the film was great. i JUST FINISHED WATCHING THE MOVIE I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT, IT IS ARTSY, AND THEN ABSTRACT IN MY OPINION ALMOST LIKE A ANDY WARHOL PAINTING,  2 THUMBS UP, I LIKED THE CHARACTERS JOSH, CASSIE AND MIKE. I WISH ALL THE BEST IN MORE OF YOUR MOVIE MAKING  ""PETERMAN""",1350086400,2,290,4.254545454545455
8191419,3,B000PHTN2Y,"This movie traced the relationship between a man (Koo) and a woman (Liu) who were soul mates and yet couldn't commit to one another despite their affection and love for one another. Liu had the problem of commitment because since she was a girl, the people that she cared about would leave her (un)intentionally. Therefore, she had this defence mechanism of not committing herself emotionally to anybody so as not to get hurt anymore.  Koo had this problem of commitment and over the years knowing Liu, he would be going out with various women.  They both had the best friends in a hairdresser who's this movie's narrator.  The hairdresser loved Liu but Liu wasn't interested. This on and off relationship would carry on for years and we got to see them transforming from university students into matured adults. The name of the movie was where every year, no matter what happened, Koo would ring her to sing the song to her.  One day, it just so happened that Koo called Liu to say that he was getting married & only years later, we found out the reason why they would forever remain as lovers separated by life circumstances.  Was it tragic or was it just the way life planned its path.  This movie wouldn't be suitable for somebody that yearned for instant gratification but it would suit somebody who could sit through hours just to get the essence of feel of the movie as in ""In the Mood for Love"" even though its aesthetic presentation is nowhere near as in the latter description.  A commendable movie and a movie that's starred by arguably two of the biggest stars in Asia right now.",1179878400,,1591,4.620567375886525
