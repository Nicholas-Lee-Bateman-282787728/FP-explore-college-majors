2655065,5,B000ICM5SU,"This moive is about the Cheetah Girls going to Barcelona for a tour. The

charters name are Keely Willams,Sabrina Braon,Adrian Baylon,and Raven Smoney. The Cheetah Girls 2 took place in Barcelona and New York. The movie is on at night on the Disney Channel. I liked it very much. I liked the movie because they have good singing and dancing. I'd also think they wear pretty clothes and hair styles. They sing some songs in different lanuguages. I think all ages would like this movie if they like to dance. These people would like this movie because they liked to dance a lot.",1160611200,2,576,4.592233009708738

2655158,5,B000ICM5SU,This is the second movie in the Cheetah Girls movie. In this film the girls travel to Spain and enter into a music contest. The backdrop for the movie is stunning and the music (including songs in Spanish) are truely wonderful. Perfect of any Disney fan.,1354838400,,254,4.543478260869565

2655160,1,B000ICM5SU,"We are here to serve others, not to please others.  Whether you serve as a social worker, teacher, hairdresser, or short-order cook, we all serve.  At least that is my belief.  This film, although visually entertaining and fun to watch, also communicates a wealth of Disney falsehoods to our youth.  The principal falsehood I wish to attack here is that the road to success in life lies in pleasing the world.

I suppose that for entertainers like the Cheetah Girls, pleasing others is part of what it means to be successful in life.  The success of an artist today is measured by how many people buy the records and attend the concerts produced by the artist.  Success in our society is the capitalist success.  But that is not the case for most of us who choose other career paths.  What is success, say, for a teacher?  Or a bricklayer for that matter?  For a teacher it would be having educated students that can perform well on standardized tests.  For a bricklayer, it is in building good walls that can shelter human beings for a very long time.  In short, the rewards of a job well done for both of them.

At different stages throughout the movie, the Cheetah Girls perform for important-looking executives who can't even detach their cellphones from their ears as they watch the girls perform, before then pronouncing their approval by advancing The Girls to another level in the competition.  The viewer can then observe the Cheetah Girls going bananas over this approval.  I, for one, was horrified by this because it clearly sends the message that success in life is about, to use American Idol parlance, ""Wowing the pants off Simon.""  I hope that the sexual connotations of that quote are not lost on anyone.  It is, in essense, a sexual disempowerment when a woman comes to believe that her success depends on making a man ""hard"" for her, but that is exactly what is going on in this movie.

It is a disempowering belief to have when you think that you absolutely have to go around pleasing others.  Can you imagine your child operating under such a belief?  Imagine your daughter thinking she needs to please others in order to be successful in life.  How soon before she becomes pregnant?  Fourteen?  How soon before she has a mouth full of herpes?  Twelve?  Don't worry.  You can always teach her to call them ""cold-sores.""

The movie also misrepresents Spanish culture to a great extent.  A spanish guitarist is seen performing rythm and blues style music for the Cheetah Girls.  The Cheetah Girls themselves are treated as larger-than-life celebrities, as if they were Cher, Madonna, Lady Gaga, and Tina Turner on tour together.  A bit of a stretch for a Disney generated act.  Also Spain is a very white and pretty racist country.  If I was an African-American pseudo-celebrity, Spain would not be my first choice for a country in which to try to ""make it.""

Life is about service.  To teach our kids anything else is a gross diservice to them.  That Disney is attempting to communicate sexual disempowerment to our young girls is quite creepy in itself, and something that should put parents on guard against anything that comes out of Disney.",1290729600,,3164,4.720292504570384

2655171,5,B000ICM5SU,"I love the Cheetahs and was highly anticpating the movie. I was excited when I saw the name of the director, Kenny Ortega, the man who gave us the Famous High School Musical. So I was expecting a lot to say the least.

Well I was very pleased to see that was not disappointed. The Story line was good. The music was HOT and the film location (Barcelona)was Cheetah-lious!!

I was also happy that the script did not try to box the characters in the way they were from the 1st movie. Its apparrent in style, dress and manner that the Girls have grown as individuals and as friends...

All I can say is ""Is a Cheetah girls 3 on the Horizon?""",1168560000,7,638,4.213114754098361

2655180,5,B000ICM5SU,"This sequel to the cheetah girls movie is awsome. I think that this is one of the best movies this year. In the first movie there are four girls that try out for a talent show at there Manhatan school in New York. The girls succeed,but then Jakal Johnson comes back to the school he went to when he was young...now he's a record producer. He offers The Cheetah Girls a demo and when they accept his offer one of the cheetahs doesn't want to do it. The girls get into an argument and don't talk to each other for a while. But when one of the girls are on there way to the talent show there's chaos. The power ends up getting cut off,and messes up the talent show. The girls end up getting back together and are friends again.

  The Cheetah Girls 2 is  about the girls going to Spain for a contest.

And when the girl get there there is a Girl names Marisol who is a spanish singer. She is in the contest and her mother ends up getting in the way(or at least she tries).Marisol doesn't like what her mother is trying to do and hangs with the cheetahs...

  But in the end it still is CHEETAH LICIOUS",1163289600,2,1098,4.122065727699531
2655181,2,B000ICM5SU,"I find this movie to be a really good young people's movie.  There is a lot of a somewhat realistic fantasy mood here.  Good songs, good dancing.  The fact they went half way around the world for a different backdrop is also a positive.  This at least has some young people looking for the location of Spain, just to be informed.

Inspirational in a way to send a message you can make it if you try.  Not just singing and dancing, but translating in to anything you might attempt.  Work for your goal, and be willing to work hard.

But there is just one very big glaring misstep, no a dilibrate oversight.  Here we have four very lovely young ladies, of color, but there are purposely no young men of color in any major role in this movie.  Why?  Socially in the 21st century Disney has deleted a part of our society.  From ""The Cinderella Story"" starring Brandy, to the ""Cheetah Girls 2"".  No young men of color.  Shame on you Disney.

There is an old saying, ""It is not what you say, it is what you do"".  What you have a habit of doing sends a very, very negative message to all our young people.",1160611200,8,1098,4.257281553398058
