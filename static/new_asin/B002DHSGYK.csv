3910518,5,B002DHSGYK,I've seen this on the History Channel. It is incredible what can be done with technology and silent film. I can only hope that more is done with this type of footage. Most will not like this video as it 'humanizes' Hitler and makes him seem like a normal person in everyday conversation.,1249776000,11,287,4.433962264150943
3910519,1,B002DHSGYK,"I would rate this item a zero star, but you can't go that low! Somehow, I bought this be mistake. Who would want to hear the voice of Adolph Hitler, a miscreant who the world would have been better off if he had not been born!
Save your money and don't buy it even at this rediculously low price. It is not even worth a buck. It is completely worthless. I am sure that only the skinheads will buy it, and others of their ilk! Join them if you want!",1247961600,6,448,3.988888888888889

8365213,5,B002DHSGYK,HISTORY CHANNEL dvd  and packaged like it.  Very interesting subject matter on giving voice to Hitler's home movies.,1486339200,,116,5.388888888888889
8365214,3,B002DHSGYK,"They show the same clips and over and over and what they do decipher in the end is something anyone with common sense would gather from watching the clip. A tiny bit of insight, but overall - not the best Hitler video for those studying this part of WWII history.",1485043200,,263,4.28
8365215,4,B002DHSGYK,A hiden part of history. Good to watch.,1459728000,,39,4.0
8365216,3,B002DHSGYK,"Surprisingly unbiased for a western program, although some of the usual western propaganda. Overall not too bad and some nice new technology.",1357516800,,141,5.454545454545454
8365217,4,B002DHSGYK,"This has a great perspective. It shows how words can be heard even when there is no sound, and how they do it. It is too bad there isn't more film to see and hear more.",1353888000,,168,3.6944444444444446
8365218,5,B002DHSGYK,"Update: I have received only negative votes for this review. I'm not sure why. I suppose I should make it clear that I am not defending Hitler here. He was a monster in a very real sense. I was only trying to get across the idea, which I do hold to, is that the same capacity to be a Hitler is in most, if not all, of us.

Some people see a demon lurking behind every wall. The danger for people who try to think rationally through things is to see no demons at all.

To watch the private videos of Hitler, knowing that lip-sync experts have added words to those silent movies, one is shown that Hitler was actually a sane person. At least it would seem from the videos that Hitler was able to hold normal, sane and even lighthearted conversations. That he was not simply an obsessed maniac, but a rational and logical human being with feelings and a certain soft side towards those whom he loved.

A great book to go alongside this would be Stanley Milgram's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Obedience-to-Authority-An-Experimental-View-Perennial-Classics/dp/006176521X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View (Perennial Classics)</a>, which studied the effects of malevolent authority on ordinary American citizens.

I would also recommend:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Extravaganzas-Of-The-Third-Reich-DVD/dp/B0000DINLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Extravaganzas Of The Third Reich [DVD</a>]",1338681600,,1511,6.046728971962617
8365219,5,B002DHSGYK,"You won't ever find a better documentary about Adolf Hitler.  You'll even find out a thing or two about yourself.  This film stays objective to the very end.  It covers the films most have seen, but few have heard, until now!  Prepare to hear the voices from the past.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Private-Voice-of-Hitler/dp/B002DHSGYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Private Voice of Hitler</a>",1318723200,4,438,6.767857142857143
8365220,2,B002DHSGYK,"There is precious little here of interest to any serious student of history.  Most of the film tells us things that most historians already know.  And when we finally get to the actual words of Hitler, revealed by lipreading, they are mundane.  So, what little gems did we think came from him in private?  There are far more revealing films about the fuhrer, e.g., Leni Riefenstahl's ""Triumph of the Will"" and a dozen or so other productions.

I did have some interest in the technique respecting the revelation of how lips are read.  Thus, I give this 2 stars, none for the other content.",1300838400,,589,4.615384615384615
8365221,5,B002DHSGYK,Amazing technology and applied human skills come together with in-depth research to add another dimension to a fuller understanding of the man who so negatively impacted the last century.  A must-see for anyone with an interest in World War II history.,1299801600,,252,5.146341463414634
