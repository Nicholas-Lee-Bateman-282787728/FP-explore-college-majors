7868444,4,6304306938,"Having seen several films by Claude Chabrol (-IE- ""Les Biches"", ""Le Boucher"", ""La Rupture"", ""La Crmonie"", ""Merci Pour Le Chocolat"") before having viewed this one -- ""Le Beau Serge"" seems like the work of another filmmaker.  Technically this was the first film of the French New Wave.  As such, it features (1) some very good black and white cinematography (the snowy scenes towards the end of the picture are especially beautiful); (2) crude and quirky provincial characters that are well delineated; and (3) an excellent score by mile Delpierre; Chabrol cleverly and effectively used the orchestrations of this score to highlight dramatic moments and character appearances via musical punctuation.  Yet in spite of everything I like about this picture -- Its style is not yet Chabrol to me.  Although there is an innocence about this film that is refreshing -- Especially in contrast to the sinister direction Chabrol would take to create his unique murder-mystery-thriller-type genre (albeit always tinged with humour).

Secondly -- This picture seems like a companion piece / bookend to Chabrol's second feature, ""Les Cousins"", in which Grard Blain and Jean-Claude Brialy are once again cast as the leads.  However -- ""Les Cousins"" exhibits a big leap forward in Chabrol's style -- It offers up some verve in terms of its sophistication and polish.  It is obvious that Chabrol learned a lot from ""Le Beau Serge"" and applied that knowledge to ""Les Cousins"".  In closing: Besides the leads in ""Le Beau Serge""-- Brialy (Franois Bayon) and Blain (Serge), both of whom are well-cast and outstanding in their roles -- There are other excellent performances in this film; notably Bernadette Lafont as Marie, the coquettish, seductive ""stepdaughter"" of Glomaud; and Edmond Beauchamp, a genuine character actor, who plays the ""stepfather"" Glomaud with serio-comic aplomb.

7868445,5,6304306938,"Monsieur Chabrol's first feature film is entirely impressive.
His early directorial genius is lucky enough to have utilized the dazzling, acting abilities of the handsome Blain and Brialy in their primes. In an interview, the actor Brialy comments that in this story the relationship of the two friends is ambiguous-- and I quite agree. There's more than just plain, innocent friendship between the two. I see a double meaning in their interactions, sensing some homosexual undertone. Maybe there has been no actual physical intimacies
but solely emotional or pyschological. I have seen a few Chabrols and admire this director's capacity to challenge me such as the magnificent movie--Le Beau Serge--which I recommend to everyone who truly loves cinema.",1324684800,,753,5.389830508474576
7868446,5,6304306938,"When discussion is brought up among cinema peers of nouvelle vague (The French New Wave), its easy to think of names such as Francois Truffau, Jean-Luc Goard, Eric Rohmer, Jacques Rivette.  Individuals, colleagues and contemporaries who each worked for Cahiers du cinema before they became filmmakers.

But there is one man that was a colleague who may have not received the prestige as his contemporaries but is respected for his contribution towards cinema with his thrillers but also years of cinema as part of his oeuvre.  The man I am talking about is Claude Chabrol.

While debated of which film kicked off the French New Wave, many regard Chabrol's 1958 film ""Le Beau Serge"" (Handsome Serge) as the film that began the Nouvelle Vague. Feature films created by contemporaries of Cahiers du Cinema that went on to become filmmakers.

In fact, Francois Truffaut had given Chabrol the biggest compliment in 1958 for his directorial debut on ""Le Beau Serge"" saying, ""Technically the film is as masterful as if Chabrol had been directing for ten years, though this is his first contact with the camera.  Here is an unusual and courageous film that will raise the level of French cinema"".

If there is one thing that can be said about Chabrol, although his name is not as well known as Truffaut or Godard in America, and while ""Le Beau Serge"" is a long awaited release for a Chabrol film from the Criterion Collection, he still remains the most prolific filmmaker among his contemporaries who nearly has released a film every year since 1958 starting with ""Le Beau Serge"" and ending in 2009 with ""Bellamy"", a year before Chabrol passed away.

For cinema fans, many have been wanting the Criterion Collection release of a Claude Chabrol film on DVD for a very long time but finally, the Criterion Collection will be releasing two Chabrol films, ""Le Beau Serge"" (1958) and ""Les Cousins (1959) on Blu-ray and DVD in Sept. 2011.

""Le Beau Serge"" is written and directed by Claude Chabrol and would star Jean-Claude Brialy (""A Woman is a Woman"", ""The Phantom of Liberty"", ""Elevator to the Gallows"") and Gerard Blain (""Hatari"", ""Les Cousins"", ""Le Mistons""). The film would also feature the beautiful cinematography of Henri Decae (""The 400 Blows"", ""Le Samourai"", ""Elevator to the Gallows"") and long-time Chabrol editor Jacques Gaillard.

VIDEO:

""Le Beau Serge"" is presented in black and white (1:33:1 aspect ratio) and immediately upon watching this film, you start to realize how beautiful this film looks, from the symmetry of objects to the chose angles and shots of the characters as they walk towards the camera, away from the camera or trying to incorporate the city into the film.

And as Henri Decae had shown in the 1956 film ""Bob le Flambeur"", his cinematic style can be seen the following year through ""Le Beau Serge"", ""Elevator to the Gallows"" and ""The Lovers"".  Beautiful cinematography and following the direction of Claude Chabrol who wanted to capture the look and feel of the city of Sardent in his film.

The film is over 50-years-old and on Blu-ray, the Criterion Collection did a wonderful job in making the film look absolutely beautiful.  Black levels are nice and deep, contrast and showcasing the whites and blacks are beautiful and for the most part, ""Le Beau Serge"" doesn't have any artifacts, edge enhancement nor did I detect anything negative in terms of overall picture quality.  The film looks fantastic on Blu-ray!

According to the Criterion Collection, the new digital transfer was created in 2K resolution on an ARRISCAN film scanner from the original camera negative.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using Revival Flame, and Smoke, while Digital Vision's DVNR system was used for small, grain and noise reduction.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Le Beau Serge"" is presented in monaural French with English subtitles.  Dialogue is clear, subtitles were easy to read and for the most part, the vocals were cleared and detected no hiss or crackle during my viewing of the film.  If anything, I really enjoyed how Emile Delpierre incorporated music to this film, especially the quick music cuts whenever Serge or Glomaud are shown on screen.

According to the Criterion Collection, the original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from a 35 mm optical track print. Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD. Crackle was attenuated using Audio Cube's integrated workstation.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Hauntingly beautiful.  These are the two words that I describe Claude Chabrol's debut film ""Le Beau Serge"".

An incredible feat. for the Cahiers du Cinema critic who produced, wrote and directed the film and I don't know if I can categorize the film as a psychological drama.

The late Francois Truffaut described the film as a chess game and perhaps if you see the film in that perspective, it does make sense.  You have Francois (Brialy) who once lived in a small village now from a big city who comes back into town.  Francois is actually a nice man, non-intrusive nor does he flaunt to anyone that he is better than them because he lives in the city.

But for the villagers, it's a preconceived notion that because he was able to move away from the village, he thinks he is better than they are.

I put myself in the shoes of Francois, also coming from a small town and having lived in the city and I know there are moments when I was younger in which I have flaunted to friends in town about the fact that the city is fun for its close proximity to shopping, beaches and as a young man, there were a lot of women.  But looking back at it now, it was so trivial, so much of commodity fetishism in boosting one's ego of the have's to the have nots.

But I look at the situation that is presented in ""Le Beau Serge"", he doesn't flaunt but his presence in the village, wearing his nice clothing in front of those who are barely surviving and not so happy with life but have accepted their life in the village as final.

This is where I identify with Francois because when you go back, you want to help your friends, especially those you feel have so much potential to be something bigger.  In the case of Serge, he is a man that had so many dreams, wanted to leave the village like Francois but got a young woman pregnant and found himself married and stuck in the village he desperately wanted to leave.  He has kept this burden of having his first child dead at birth but knowing that the right thing to do is stick by your wife and living life to provide for one's family but in his case, drowning all the sorrows away through drinking heavily.

I've known to many people like Serge in my life who live their life as is...miserable and unhappy inside but are traditional.  While Francois had left the city and his big advice to Serge, ""to leave his wife"".  It may seem quite harsh but it is logical that if a man is unhappy with his marriage, you leave.

But with Serge, he knows with a baby along the way...he can't leave.

But it's the return of Francois that enhances Serge's negative and jealous emotions.  You would think that there would be an ebullient sense of emotion but with each meeting between both Francois and Serge, you feel this ominous feeling that things are not right.

We see a scene with Serge wanting to tell Francoise of why he became a drunk.  Why he lives this lifestyle.  Why he is so miserable but if Francois only solution is for Serge to leave his pregnant wife, it's unacceptable.

And for Francois, he had forgotten how things were in his village and many who see potential within him want him to leave because he is better off than being back at home where many men do not aspire to be bigger, they just live life as is, even if its a life of effete, a lack of vitality that one can not escape.  Life is what it is...you just live it, repeat it.

And of course, Francois seeing this...he wants to make a difference.  But can he?

""Le Beau Serge"" is a magnificent feat. for Claude Chabrol as his debut film.  While his future in cinema may not have been as lucrative nor historic in comparison to his other contemporaries, the fact is Chabrol is a filmmaker who did things his way, his style and he continued to create films in 1958 with ""Le Beau Serge"" through 2009, a year before he died.

""Le Beau Serge"" is a film that is mature but perhaps is also a film that brings Claude Chabrol back to his village of Sardent and is in someway a self-discovery of his present life and his past.  The film is not autobiographical but it's a film that Chabrol was proactive in making sure the village of Sardent, what he saw in terms of life was captured onscreen.  And of course, the cinematography is quite beautiful and it helps to have one of the best cinematographer's in French cinema at the time, Henri Deca.

The film also has elements of Chabrol's life as he also wanted to become a priest at one time and help people.  The film was raw in the way that Chabrol created a film with a small cast and worked in familiar territory, his hometown with a potential of many extras alongside him.

But through its visual beauty and its complex characters but accessible storyline, ""Le Beau Serge"" is a film that started the Nouvelle Vague era of film critics of Cahiers du Cinema taking up the mantle of becoming filmmakers.  He inspired his contemporaries because he was able to go through his own filmmaking route and create this film with his own personal vision without having to follow any big studio or producer.  It was his film, no ifs, ands or buts.

Surprisingly, ""Le Beau Serge"" while adored by film critics, it was delayed to the point that when it was released in theaters, his second film ""Les Cousins"" would be released a month later and it was his second film that would actually become the commercial hit.

While ""Le Beau Serge"" doesn't break any new ground, nor is it remembered as a non-traditional film when compared to Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows"" and Godard's ""Breathless"", in 1958, it's the fact that he was a man who had creative freedom to do what he wanted and capture the raw feel of his village onscreen with beautiful lighting and awesome performances by Brialy and Blain that make ""Le Beau Serge"" worth watching.

Once again, I applaud the Criterion Collection for bringing Claude Chabrol films to their collection but also giving both ""Le Beau Serge"" and ""Les cousins"" the Blu-ray treatment.  The Blu-ray release looks fantastic and the addition of the documentary of Chabrol returning back to Sardent and watching these classic interviews is priceless!

Overall, if you are a Chabrol fan, a cinema fan or brand new to cinema and want important films in your cinema collection, then ""Le Beau Serge"", the first film of the French New Wave is definitely recommended!",1323993600,7,11761,4.7302599313388916
7868447,4,6304306938,"After watching Chabrol's Le Beau Serge its clear why this isn't the film most people think of when they think ""New Wave."" In fact this is really more neo-realism or neo-naturalism albeit with splashes of melodrama.

Truffaut and Godard's early works are full of an iconoclastic energy and hugely charismatic stars playing characters who seem to be reinventing life while Chabrol's early efforts are about the impossibility of escaping our connections to the past, in this case our provincial past.

In Le Beau Serge a young cosmopolitan named Francois returns to his country village after being away for ten years. Even though he finds that his old friend Serge and the locals do not really want him there he stays perhaps as much out of a sense of guilt as out of a sense of compassion for Serge and the other villagers who at least in Francois's view seem to have resigned themselves to fates that are somehow beneath them and this is precisely the kind of condescension that annoys everyone when Francois comes around. Even though at the beginning of the film we think this is going to be a story of Serge's redemption by storys end we see that it is a story of Francois' redemption as well. The fates of Francois and Serge seem to be intertwined in some not altogether explainable way.

In Les Cousins, Chabrols second film, a country boy ventures to the city to live with his more sophisticated cousin only to find that he'll never be able to escape the provincial world that formed him. But again the fates of the two cousins seem to be intertwined in some inexplicable way.

The fact that both of Chabrol's first two films star the same two actors in very similar symbiotic relationships reinforces the idea that these two films are to be viewed together.

This theme of symbiotically joined couples is one that Chabrol will revisit throughout his career and is the central theme of his last film, Inspector Bellamy.

These works are new wave only insofar as they dispense with the usual social and cinematic decorums. Godard's new wave was about razing cinema to raise political consciousness, Truffaut's about challenging oppressive (educational and cultural)traditions, but Chabrol's is about a sincere depiction of the social pressures and psychology of young men in competition with each other which can in moments so easily lead to sociopathology.

Later in his career, Chabrol will examine the sociopathology of the bourgeoisie in revolt against itself. And this revolt will more often than not take the form of adultery that ends in murder. But at this early stage Chabrol seems most interested in the sociology of status. Both of his first two films feature the passage or failure of exams as a deciding factor in how one views oneself and how the rest of one's life will play out. Early failure can be devastating, but, in Chabrol's world, so can early success.

The strange thing about Le Beau Serge, especially in comparison with Breathless or Jules et Jim, is its austere setting and themes. At this point Chabrol seems more spiritually akin to Bresson than to either of his new wave counterparts. Les Cousins is set in Paris but its themes are decidedly dark which seems to be the side of human nature Chabrol is most fascinated with. This fascination with the dark and pathological side of human nature remains a consistent theme throughout the rest of his career. What changes throughout the sixties is his attitude toward that dark side. By the late-sixites he develops a rather clinical approach to the recording of pathological behaviour; a clinical approach with a strange almost comic twist (the strange smile that forms on the directors face and your own being  a reaction to the inevitability/unavoidability of the human folly that he records).",1317513600,5,3774,4.884375
7868448,5,6304306938,"I feel that ""Le Beau Serge"" is a very sweet and well thought out film.  It tells a story of a young student (Francois Bayon) who returns to his countryside hometown to recuperate.  Upon arrival, he runs into a drunkard whom he recognizes to be his childhood friend (Serge).  Francois' friend Michel tells him how Serge is on the verge of self-destruction after failing to get his architectural degree.  Later, both friends are reunited and have an opportunity to catch up on old times.  Francois observes Serge's inconsistent and erratic behavior and tries to help him mend his way.  Along the way, Francois meets Serge's wife (Yvonne) and her sister (Marie).  Francois has a brief affair with Marie before finding out she is raped by her ""father"".  One night during the village dance, their affair ended with everyone humiliating and ridiculing Francois.  Serge, angry with Francois for coming to his life while he's at his lowest point begins to despise beat him up in public.  After the incident, Francois realizes that the people in the old village he used to remember are no longer the same.  His conversation with the village priests destroyed all the innocent illusions he initially had.  While the priest advises him to leave the village, Francois vows to stay on to help Serge and his family mend their lives.
I believe ""Le Beau Serge"" was Chabrol's first feature film.  He later went on to make another feature ""Les Cousins"" which might be intended to complement ""Le Beau Serge"".  Chabrol engaged actors Jean-Claude Brialy and Gerald Blain for both films with their roles and situations reversed.  I first saw ""Les Cousins"" before ""Le Beau Serge"".  Jean-Claude Brialy, being a brilliant actor that he was, gave out a stellar performance in both films.  He's so good that I could not identify him as Jean-Claude Brialy anymore. Instead, I was so taken in by his acting ability that he became a sly, cunning snake whom I hated so much (Paul) in ""Les Cousins"" or a gentle, sensitive and wonderful young man whom I fell in love with (Francois) in ""Le Beau Serge"".
You have to watch both films to appreciate a surreal, mocking quality and ironic effects that Chabrol wanted to create. I love both films very much.  Chabrol has an amazing eyes for details (scenes, storyline) as well as depth for the films' dialogues, story lines and plots. If I have a choice, I think the title of this film should be changed to ""Le Beau Francois"" instead :P  Once again ""Le Beau Serge"" is a beautiful film that deserves many stars.",1052784000,24,2521,4.767281105990784
7868449,3,6304306938,"Credited as the first feature of the French New Wave, Claude Chabrol's first film as writer/director has little of the controlled tension that defines his best work. This study of a village which witnesses the return of Francois, who left 12 years ago to seek a future in Paris, has Chabrol's customary exploration of the class divisions in French society, with the prodigal son the bourgeoisie, and the villagers the pagan primal proletariat. Francois is determined to ""help"" his friend Serge and the lifestyle Francois clearly disapproves of. However the idea that these people need help is a sign of superiority and impertinent presumption, signified by Serge's wife's claim that Serge wasn't disatisfied with his life until Francois returned and pointed out that he should be. Chabrol makes Serge's wife pregnant, with her first child born mongoloid and dead, so that the condition of the unborn child symbolises the future, at least as seen through Francois. Chabrol's dialogue has occasional lapses into exposition which betray him as a novice storyteller and odd bursts of melodramatic music, and the only New Wave touch is the use of a torch to light one scene, where it points straight into the camera. Chabrol presents the bleakness of the village with Serge walking drunkenly through the cemetary, a lone dog walking the streets, and a gang of school children travelling to and from their school. His scenes of violence have an immediacy compared to the exchanges between Francois and Serge. and a romance between Francois and Serge's half-sister, and Chabrol provides memorable images - an overlap of Francois' face and falling snow, an ominous slow closing of a door, a long closeup of a woman crying, and cutting from Serge's wife in labour to Francois falling and Serge being dragged along the ground. There is also an interesting dance sequence, which shows the villagers in a more sophisticated environment, and also featuring two women dancing together for one to interpret as you may.",985737600,8,2003,5.091185410334346
