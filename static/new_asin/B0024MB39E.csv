Each volume in this series gets progressively longer and more in depth about a more complex effect.

Volume one ""Introduction to make-up effects"" demonstrates: Gelatin make-up, Cotton and latex make-up and Wax build up make-up. and comes in around 30 minutes.

Volume two ""Basic foam rubber appliance""  demonstrates everything from the Design, full face life casting and Mold making, Sculpture technique, how to work with Foam rubber, finish work, make-up application and artificial teeth.  All in about 45 minutes.

Volume three ""Cable controlled mechanical mask"" demonstrates: full head life casting and mold making, making a fiberglass underskull, designing and fabricating the foam rubber skin, sculpture techniques and cable controls, even a little bit about costuming.  Coming in at about 60 minutes this is by far the most informative tape in the series and the best value for money, it works as a stand alone tutorial or if you can only get all three as a pack makes up for the shorter volumes.

I urge people though to look around and find a good price, you shouldn't pay much more than about $[...] for all three.  Don't give in to the scalpers who are trying to sell it them for hundreds of dollars!  If you can't find it here check out [...]
