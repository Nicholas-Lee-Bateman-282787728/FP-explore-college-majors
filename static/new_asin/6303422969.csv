639806,5,6303422969,"Its hard to describe a film like this. You don't watch it instead you(not to sound like a stupid hippy) you experience it,of course if your not repulsed by the concept that gay love is just as important as straight  love. I have to admit out of all the films I have ever seen, this is the  only one that really affected me. Not only did it open my mind to sexuality  but to art as well.with the help of River phoenix's true performance and a  series of strikingly executed visual conceits van sant hones in on to some  of the key elements that swim their way back and forth american society in  the 90's. Alienation, indifference, and most of all a sense of detachment  from one's environment. From first viewing the film will appear to be quite  abstract, but its actually quite simple . It transcends its period and is  able to look back on it observingly, even before it truly happened. Made in  1991 'my own private idaho'beautifully encaptures its time and makes us all  glad that the 1990's are finally over.",947808000,,1014,4.456521739130435
639807,4,6303422969,"Just finished watching the video and am mindblown.  Wouldn't say it's a GREAT movie ... the Shakespearean angle didn't quite work for me. But it clearly portrays the depth of vulnerability, the at-once jaded and innocent  quality of the street kids, especially Mike (Phoenix).  I have  the feeling  River's death was probably hastened by playing this role. It's hard to  imagine how any actor, especially a young one, would not be deeply affected  by portraying the extreme abandonment and feeling of being unlovable that  this role required, especially if he wasn't emotionally stable and/or  lacked a strong support system.  But for all its grittiness, its graphic  depiction of the screwed-up-ness of the world, this movie left me with a  feeling of compassion for all of us humans ... the deep wounds we sustain  and our desperate attempts to find meaning.  This is not an easy movie to  watch; it won't make anyone happy and may actually leave you depressed, but  it may also break your heart open and make you want to tell someone that  you love them.",928713600,4,1057,4.848314606741573
639808,5,6303422969,"This movie has some of the most interesting characters and innovative cinematography I have ever seen. The camera techniques used in this film are mindblowing! From the dreamlike beginning and end, to the shocking  flashbacks of Pheonix's character, the creative and minblowing camera  techniques continue to boggle the mind throughout the film...but the most  creative experiment (in my opinion) is how in the sex scenes Van Sant shows  different angles of the characters holding poses.  But don't think that  cool camera effects are what this movie is all about! There is a great  story and brilliant cast of characters! Not to mention the dialouge(from  Henry IV part 1)! See this film and also see Drugstore Cowboy (It has a  William S. Burroughs cameo!).",916531200,2,759,5.105691056910569
639809,4,6303422969,". . . or at least ought to be.  Mike (River Phoenix) is adrift, motherless, fatherless; caught up in the male hustler's ethos in which cash-for-sex is the only thing that distinguishes him from the despised  faggot.  In a desperate bid for love he approaches his friend and  fellow-prostitute, Scott (Keanu Reeves), casting away this amulet.  However, this desperate life of suffering is not real for Scott; an  alternate role awaits him as the successor to his father, the mayor of  Portland, Oregon.  The script does loudly suggest a parallel between Scott  and Prince Hal/King Henry V, and between Bob Pigeon, Portland's prince of  thieves, and Sir John Falstaff.  Bob, Scott's former lover, and Mike too,  endure rejection by Scott as he assumes his rightful place in polite  society.  Will Mike ever awaken fully? Will he grow suitable scabs to  conceal his wounds?  Is survival worth the trouble?",915235200,2,902,4.993243243243243

640051,5,6303422969,"River Phoenix really brings it in his riveting performance as a young homeless prostitute who can't seem to put together the pieces of his life. This is Gus Van Sant's best movie, in my opinion. Full of unseemly characters that are all too convincing, with the exception of Keanu Reeves who's way out of his league in contrast to Phoenix. We only have to wonder what made Van Sant want to place Reeves in such a forceful movie? Fortunately, not much is asked from Reeves as the rebellious rich kid who plays a prostitute for the sole purpose of offending his father. His character is as flat as Reeves acting. At least Van Sant gave room to River Phoenix to carry the film from the opening setting all the way back around to the final shot.",1465257600,2,740,4.448529411764706

640055,5,6303422969,"This is without a doubt my favorite film of all time. It encompasses what it means to be an heir in modern American society. Anyone who has had expectation piled upon them, and felt the need to rebel will understand the nature of this film, and the reason it had to be made. I have watched this countless times, and I get ever more insight with every viewing.

Many will not understand this, but most people have trouble balancing a check book or understanding algebra. For someone with sufficient intellect, this film is genius. It beautifully encapsulates the nature of modern American urban existence on the fringe, and more importantly, describes why such an existence can be appealing to someone born of privilege, and why someone can both love it and return to the privilege that is their birthright.

For anyone who has slummed it for a period, or enjoys living in different social groups, this is a perfect example of creative genius. I cannot recommend it strongly enough.",1460246400,4,981,4.798816568047338

640057,5,6303422969,"""My Own Private Idaho""(1991) is directed by Gus Van Sant(Drugstore Cowboy, Good Will Hunting, Finding Forrester). The film is about two street hustlers, one (Mike - River Phoenix) of whom has narcolepsy and is continually falling asleep wherever that may be, and the other, Scott (Keenu Reeves), who comes from a well to do family. The film has an intriguing mix of quirkiness and various film techniques, to the breathtaking shots of the natural world that the two pass through. Mike's search for his mother takes them all the way from Portland, Oregon to Rome, Italy.

This blu-ray set comes with a 68 page booklet with essays by Amy Taubin, JT Leroy, Lance Loud, and reprinted interviews with Van Sant, Phoenix, and Keenu Reeves. This is a new, restored 4K digital transfer. This disc has audio commentary with the director and some features, including the making of the film, an interview with film scholar Paul Arthur, a conversation between the producer Laurie Parker and River Phoenix's sister Rain, deleted scenes and an audio conversation between JT Leroy and Jonathan Caouette.",1457481600,4,1087,5.038888888888889

640060,5,6303422969,"This story is like a stream-of-consciousness biography of the two main characters.  It's poignant at times, funny at times, and very sad at times.  Overall, it's a moving story about the unrequited love of the narcoleptic hustler, Mike, for the rich young rebel, Scott.  It's character-driven rather than plot-driven, but the fine cinematography and the unquestionably excellent acting of River Phoenix carry the movie.  Keanu Reeves is adequate, but nowhere near the brilliance of Phoenix.  Still, he's less ""wooden"" here than in other films of his I've seen.

The new 2-disc Blu-ray DVD set in the Criterion Collection is well worth the price.  In addition to the movie, there are lots of extras on the second disc, as well as a booklet containing some interesting interviews.  You can't go wrong with this one.",1456704000,8,813,5.06015037593985

The BD is an improvement in many ways (textures, detail, tonal range, etc), but there's something I actually miss, although some people who've reviewed this title tend to consider in a rather different light: I first saw this film when it was theatrically released in 1991, and I miss the ""Kodak palette"" yellow-ish hue of the DVD transfer, because (as far as I can recall) it was consistent with the visual experience of the old 35mm projection. So, the blu-ray transfer is far better in many respects, but I think it actually differs from the original film, and makes for a somehow different experience. I miss the yellow of those wide time-lapse shots in the middle of nowhere. Now, that's as far as I remember, and that shouldn't hold you back from getting this little gem of early 90s cinema.",1446768000,19,942,4.709090909090909

640169,3,6303422969,"My Own Private Idaho is an interesting mix of acting, directing, setting, and subject matter. It is an interesting watch but the elements don't cohere very well or make for a solid movie. The main problem is that little is done to first establish an emotional connection to the main character. Because of that, the rest of the film lacks in dramatic impact. Things happen, the film ends, and the impression is that while the film was decent enough, it could have been better.",1444003200,,475,4.666666666666667
640170,5,6303422969,"My Own Private Idaho is Gus Van Sants tale of two young street hustlers: Mike Waters (River Phoenix), a sensitive narcoleptic who dreams of the mother who abandoned him, and Scott Favor (Keanu Reeves), the wayward son of the mayor of Portland, Oregon and the object of Mikes desire. Scott has taken to hanging out with the street boys, his mentor the self-dramatizing Bob (William Richert), with a British accent and cape. As they navigate a volatile world of junkies, thieves, and johns, Mike takes Scott on a quest along the gritty streets and highways of the Pacific Northwest in search of an elusive place called home.

For those who know their Shakespeare, similarities between this film and Henry IV, Part I: will be apparent, but its the exploration of the tender, twisted relationship between Scott and a far more vulnerable kid named Mike that resonates. Mike is one of lifes misfits  the result of a broken, incoherent upbringing in Idaho. At key moments, he simply collapses into a languorous dream state. Scott is not really a homosexual; hes testing himself at the furthest limits of degradation, rebelling against his affluent background in order to enrage his father. Mike is just seeking warmth and shelter, but falls in love with Scott, who cannot truly return his love. The road picture takes the boys from Oregon to Idaho and then to Italy, as each one restlessly longs for his notion of home.

Director Van Sant uses hallucinatory dream sequences, dark humor, cinema verite confessions with male hustlers, artful sexual posing, and impressionistic effects to emphasize the troubled state of Mikes mind. The film showcases both actors in a way they had never been seen on screen before. Even though the characters are complex and not typically heroic, both Phoenix and Reeves infuse them with humanity and pathos. Phoenix, in particular, is simply amazing.

Bonus extras on the newly restored Blu-ray edition include a 2005 audio conversation between Van Sant and filmmaker Todd Haynes; the 2005 documentary The Making of My Own Private Idaho; deleted scenes; Kings of the Road, a 2005 interview with film scholar Paul Arthur on Van Sants adaptation of Shakespeares Henry IV and Orson Welles Chimes at Midnight; reprinted interviews with Van Sant, River Phoenix, and Keanu Reeves; and a booklet containing critical essays.",1443916800,11,2341,5.05699481865285

640275,5,6303422969,"A couple of weeks ago I was going through some movies on my computer. I came across the movie ""Sneakers"" I was instantly reminded of River Phoenix. It's been over 20 years since he left. I had forgotten how much I loved him. I would always get such a warm positive good feeling from him when I saw him in a movie. I had seen a handful of his movies when he was here, ""Indiana Jones"", ""I Love You To Death"", ""Running On Empty"" and ""Sneakers"". I still haven't seen ""Stand By Me"" to this day. I looked up all the movies that he had made and this one ""My Own Private Idaho"" I had to see it since it was gay themed as I have a lot of gay themed movies in my collection - ""Making Love"", ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""The Trip"" and so on. I never remembered hearing about this movie when it came out in 1991. This movie will be forever my favorite for River Phoenix is absolutely beautiful in it as Mike Waters, a homeless narcoleptic who's in search of his mother that abandoned him and who comes to terms with his sexuality and falls in love with his best friend, Scott Favor played by Keanu Reeves who also gives an awesome performance too as a rich man's son rebelling against his family and travelling with Mike for kicks. It is especially heart wrenching for me when I hear the pedal steel guitar play ""America The Beautiful"" and seeing River's character Mike Waters looking down the long endless lonely road. It is heartbreaking for me at the end of the movie as he's lost his love and best friend, his mother abandoned him, he's homeless and then two guys steal what he has left, his bag and his shoes while he's asleep. It will always bring me to tears. But then there is a glimmer of hope. A kind person scoops him up in his car or so it seems. The movie's visuals are very haunting with the music with scenes of salmon going upstream, rolling clouds and sunset, barns falling from the sky and scenes of the Pacific Northwest and Italy. There are some funny parts in this movie too. Two of my favorite scenes are River's character Mike doing the little Dutch boy scene and scenes with Hans, the gay flaming German guy. When I hear this music ""America The Beautiful"" in this movie it is a tearful reminder for me of how we profess this country to be the greatest country in the world and at the same time we are so cruel and hateful to some of its people and combined with fact that River, this beautiful human being has left us. He did so much for us on social issues with animals and people at his young age. It saddens me today that young people and not so young people aren't aware of some of the most hateful and cruel legislation some of these conservatives are trying to pass today in the name of the Christian religion. They have no concept. They are constantly on their smart phones texting and talking about the Kardashians unaware of dangerous and cruel hateful things that are trying to be passed by our so called compassionate and very ignorant higher-ups. For if River Phoenix was here today he would be very aware of this and be standing up for people's basic rights. He was a very compassionate intelligent young man. I also thank his parents so much for his upbringing and making him aware of these things. I will always remember River Phoenix, not mainly for his acting, but mostly for his compassion for animal and human rights and the environment. All issues that are important to me. I will also remember his music. I'm a musician myself and understand his passion for music. ""Across The Way"" performed by River's band, Aleka's Attic is a masterpiece. To director Gus Van Sant-You made a masterpiece in ""My Own Private Idaho"" with River shining his brightest, and to River Phoenix- You are the greatest River of them all and may all your tributaries spread throughout this earth and beyond.",1431907200,,3806,4.4308131241084165

My Own Private Idaho was the result of three projects coming together. The first was a modern adaptation of Henry IV called Howling At The Moon, which was about street kids in Portland and was told entirely in William Shakespearean verse. The second was called In A Blue Funk, and was about two Spanish cousins, living on the streets of Las Vegas, who decide to go to Spain after seeing their last name on a Spanish map and wanting to find out about themselves and their family. The third was actually titled My Own Private Idaho and was about an early version of the Mike character as a hustler who gets picked up by a German auto parts salesman and ""kept"" at his house. Gus Van Sant had trouble finishing the scripts, so he merged them together into the finished form.

Reeves' wooden acting is appropriate in this context and allows the scene to work.

640589,4,6303422969,"There is a simple beauty about `My Own Private Idaho' that doesn't instantly catch the eye.  In fact, it took me a few viewings before I settled down on it.  The film is carried quite effectively by a very strong performance given by River Phoenix (such a sorely missed talent), but there is a delicacy to the entirety of the film that I think adds more weight than a mere performance could.

It has flaws, but they are forgivable.

The film tells the story of two friends, Mike and Scott, who bond over their respective struggles.  Scott is a child of wealth who forsakes his father's fortunes for the life of a street dweller; a mere act of rebellion he intends on exchanging for his inheritance at a later date.  Mike is not so calculated.  Mike is eternally lost in the struggle to find himself.  He has a shady recollection of his past.  He suffers from narcolepsy that springs itself on him when his memory is jogged and stress enters the equation.  He is desperate to find his mother, more or less looking for some sort of closure.  He lacks love in his life and yet he is aching to express his true feelings for Scott.  Mike and Scott both sell themselves for money, but they each have a different idea of what that means for them and their future.

Like I said, the film is not perfect.  I have a few issues with the way the script was constructed (parts of the films first section seem overdone and parts of the final section seem rushed) and I felt that the Shakespearian dialog was, at times, awkward.  I feel that Keanu Reeves is probably the worst actor in the history of cinema to become `famous' and his performance here (while possibly his finest ever) can be a distraction, especially since his take on the character seems uneven.  While I understand that there are aspects of his personality that are not revealed in the outset of the film, Reeves should have understood how to layer the character so that the revelations wouldn't seem so off-putting.  That said, the film has a slew of redeemable factors that make up for the issues I have.  Gus Van Sant is one of those directors who has a vision.  At times I don't think it translates as well as he wants it to (`Good Will Hunting', `Psycho') but then there are times when his vision is beautifully rendered (`Elephant', `To Die For').  Despite its flaws, Van Sant really creates something cohesive with `My Own Private Idaho'.  It is a nice mix of the dark comedic tones he would later perfect with `To Die For' with the dramatic tensions he would later water down in `Good Will Hunting'.  While I found it a tad clunky in scenes, overall his tone is nicely rendered.  The imagery is staggering.  Van Sant understood how to immortalize his mood with the camera, whether it be studying the sweat on Phoenix's face or glazing the Roman countryside.

And then there is River Phoenix.

The delicate and haunting performance that Phoenix manages to deliver has, by many, been labeled one of the best in the history of cinema.  After many viewings I must agree.  There are no real dramatics used (unless you count the pits of narcoleptic seizers) to grab you.  Instead, Phoenix burns from within, creating a quiet and harrowing character in Mike.  There is a moment in the film, at a campfire, where Mike reveals his true feelings for Scott.  The way that Phoenix handles the dialog (and the sheer fact that he wrote the scene himself) shows how much he understood this character.  That understanding translates well to the audience, for they feel the pain in his soul.  It is a soft performance, but it speaks volumes.

I also wanted to mention that James Russo's brief scene as Richard, Mike's brother (?) was outstanding.

In the end I recommend this film without hesitation.  Could it have been cleaned up a bit?  Sure, but beneath my reservations lies a beautifully sincere film that deserves your attention.",1278028800,5,3880,4.603498542274052

They had done a film before this together and their deep affection for each other and their friendship is clear - it shows through. It may have been working with his good friend, River, that made his acting so great in this film. They worked well off each other - and it showed.

640594,4,6303422969,"I had bought the original version of ""My Own Private Idaho"" on VHS a number of years ago. (It was probably within a year or two of first seeing it). Essentially, it describes the lives of teens and young adults struggling to survive on the streets of an area (which I, of course, am forgetting now) in Oregon.(More than anything, the focus is on young men who are gay or heterosexual trying to survive as street hustlers, having sex with strangers for money. It's gritty, intriguing-there are numerous characters, many of which have small roles and I didn't recognize them from anything. The two main roles of Scott and Mike are played by Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix, and, I believe this was performed beautifully by the both of them. (The bassist from the group Red Hot Chili Peppers, Flea, plays a small part in it as well.) As much as I love so many things about the movie, it did feel sort of, unfinished, perhaps with the way in which it ended, but, perhaps it was meant to end on that note. I don't know. For the most part, though, a pretty amazing film that should not be missed!!",1220140800,2,1090,4.455
640595,5,6303422969,"What a stunning film.

Lush greenery and slow drives across rural America collide with the gritty slime and sensuality of the big city in this epic film that propelled both Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix to cinematic glory. While other reviewers might concentrate on the story, I wanted to point out just how *gorgeous* this film looks on any format. The director had an eye for the environment, to be sure, and his overhead shots (especially the poignant climax) should be lessons in film-making to any aspiring film student.

The breakthrough performance here is by River Phoenix, whose character goes from stiff hustler to gooey eyed boy-in-love, all the while nursing specific medical ailments. His portrayal is multi-layered and flawless, and he is going to forever be remembered for this role. Keanu Reeves is cast as a slightly more world-wise character who is torn between his feelings for his friend as well as his obligation to himself. Yes, many people have said that this is a movie about `nothing', but what a beautiful movie about nothing it is.

The Criterion Discs do special justice to the film because this is actually a movie that should be seen on a big screen. On a television set, some of the more soaring visuals are reduced to pretty sights that don't pack a punch as much as they could. If you have a big screen, this film is made frame-for-frame for such a format. I highly recommend this film to both old and new viewers - despite the great storyline, the visuals in this film are just breathtaking.

640696,4,6303422969,"I know this review gets a little self-indulgent, but if you'll allow me to get autobiographical for just a second, you'll see why I do.

When River Phoenix breathed his last in front of Johnny Depp's Viper Room on Halloween morning in 1993, I think I was just the right age to feel a certain frisson in his passing that wouldn't have been there a year or two either way. My friend and I came home from a snowy night among trick or treaters to graphic news accounts of Phoenix's passing, and for reasons that made perfect sense to us then, we went out and got this movie on video. Ultimately we ended up buying it and watching it shall we say A LOT till about the end of the year, when new misfortunes came along, eventually in the next spring taking the form of Kurt Cobain's suicide, which trumped all previous newsworthy events in our young lives.

Well, recently I got My Own Private Idaho on DVD, motivated more about nostalgia for ninth-grade and a weirdly River Phoenix obsessed fall than out of remaining affection for the movie itself, but you know, after watching it from my perspective of today, this is a lot better film than for all my sentimentality I'd remembered it being. From its re-telling of Shakespeare with a modern boldness unseen by anything else until Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio's Romeo+Juliet a few years later, to its in-your-face trip into the living hell of junky male prostitutes living homeless in circa 1990 Portland and Seattle, Gus Van Sant's quirky film seems even more an achievement now than it ever did back in the day. In viewing My Own Private Idaho, you get to hear tales of life on the streets as told by real-life hustlers, and you get to see a pre-A-list Keanu Reeves act in his own unique and inimitable style. But above all, to be honest, the ghost of River Phoenix still haunts this movie, and always will. To view it from an all-knowing hindsight and understand that according to so many THIS was the project that introduced the one-time clean living son of hippies to the quick thrill of hard drugs...that hasn't ceased to deliver a punch, even in a more jaded decade such as this one.

If you haven't seen My Own Private Idaho, see it; it's destined to be a classic one day. If it's been a while, see it again. It holds up well and it should tell you something about how much you've changed with time.

The direction is mellow and passive in rich oranges and pastels with shots framed on the subject matter in bare form.  The film never bows down to a perfect ending nor does it make victims or violators of the characters.  It was a breakthrough art film that has aged well and avoided stereotypes immersing itself in the human characteristics everyone shares.",1151366400,8,688,4.756302521008403
640700,3,6303422969,"Look, that part where the hustlers and low-lifes hang around in their abandoned building and quote Shakespeare and jump around making theatrical gestures, that part's just terrible. Especially when the Shakespearean lines are punctuated by profanity, come on, that's just a sign of a bad screenplay. Sure, you can use a seedy setting to illustrate a Shakespearean theme. But actually lifting whole passages just creates an air of artificiality, it forces the symbolism and looks really silly. Some years ago, I knew this guy who really wanted to be a film maker, more than that, he believed in art and wanted to make thoughtful, meaningful art films. But the thing was, he had nothing to write about, so he'd just take bits and pieces from Shakespeare's plays or other far superior stories, and then he'd move them to a modern setting and add lots of trendy pop culture references. That's what this reminds me of, even when the actors caper around and recite the lines, it's like a film student's idea of what Shakespearean acting is like.

Well, so much for my attempts to avoid turning into an insufferable film critic. But in my defence, this is a big part of the film. If you take out the references to Henry IV, that's like half the dialogue. Which is a pity, since the rest is actually pretty good. The part where they all sit in a breakfast joint and two of the guys recount their sleazy exploits is right on. They don't try to play the story for its shock value, they speak very matter-of-factly, like they're speaking half to themselves. The writing is very convincing, it's like all the best parts of Drugstore Cowboy. The mumbled campfire confession by River Phoenix's character is powerfully understated, even though the film doesn't really set up his attraction to Scott.

Actually, much like Drugstore Cowboy, the strength of the film really isn't in the dialogue, acting, or cinematography. Keanu Reeves can barely read his lines, but he has a face that's absolutely perfect for the role of Scott. It's a handsome face that always carries this smug, self-satisfied expression, completely oblivious to anybody else's feelings. When Phoenix's character makes that mumbled confession, Scott just looks bemused, and even his sympathy has a half-bored tone. I don't know if it was supposed to come across this way or not, but you can read his whole personality in that expression.

Phoenix, too, is perfectly cast. He barely has any lines, and maybe that's a good thing, since his own face says much more than the screenplay. In keeping with his character (the film helpfully defines narcolepsy in the beginning), he always has a heavy, sleepy look. He hunches his body like he wants to curl up and make himself invisible. This, more than anything else in the film, shows his character's helplessness. But he's not overly sympathetic, as can be seen from his hostile posture in the presence of just about anybody else. He's someone who hates himself and, by extension, everything around him, and thus lost all interest in life a long time ago. Maybe it's only logical that the one person whom he says he loves should be a man who identifies himself as heterosexual, despises his friends, and has no remorse about abandoning them.

Also like in Drugstore Cowboy, the camerawork is not especially prominent, although the scenes of Idaho look desolately pretty. The scenes are usually filmed at short range, so most of the rooms look really small and it's impossible to really get a feel for the setting. The one time when Van Sant hits upon an effective gimmick is the part at the beginning where he shows the covers of various [...] magazines animated with the film's characters. It's artificial, and it features a declarative monologue by Keanu Reeves, but it is also a very concise and complete exposition of his character, and his face on such a magazine is a fitting metaphor for his personality. Also, during the sex scenes, Van Sant finds a way to convey the point without dwelling on it, by showing very quick montages of still images of people entwined in various positions and suchlike.

But the symbolism doesn't really hold much water, either in the Shakespeare quotes or even in the film's central theme of the protagonist's quest to find his mother. The one scene that could develop his backstory, where he brings Scott to visit his brother, plays out like a bizarre tangent to the rest of the film. Although this sub-plot provides an occasion for the campfire monologue, it's kind of hard to see why Scott even bothered to tag along all the way to rural Idaho. (The chance to go to Italy, which comes up later on, would probably appeal more to his type.) And the opening shot of the protagonist with his mother is, well, kind of simplistic, as she repeats the stock phrase, ""It's going to be all right."" And, I don't know, but I just don't see how Phoenix's character really wants to find her, it's more like her absence provides him with a reason to drift aimlessly rather than the other way around.

So, I'd say this is a conflicted film. It still has all the good parts of Drugstore Cowboy, but there's a lot of diversions now too, and they only grow from here. In the end I probably would only recommend it for one of River Phoenix's few dramatic roles.",1150243200,9,5280,4.752453653217012

What journey? A journey straight to hell.  The best parts of the film are its title and the shots of the long roads of desolate Idaho, echoing the desolation of the characters; and of teaming Portland, Oregon, just another busy industrial city with its dens of iniquity and ridiculous gratuitous violence.

I enjoyed seeing actor Phoenix's depictions of the brain disorder narcolepsy, dropping dead asleep in his tracks, a metaphor for the lost dead soul of Phoenix. If only Gus Van Sant could have made debauchery intriguing, instead of tormenting, and left the viewer to contemplate, ""Why on earth?""

Nevertheless, I saw this in the theater when it was first released, and my opinion hasn't changed: Phoenix is as good as you've heard and the film absolutely has it's moments--- many wonderful moments.

Then there's Keanu.

Who tried to marry this guy to Shakespeare? He's way out of his league with this kind of material. And these sections of the film, especially the group exchanges in the broken-down tenament house, seem badly edited, those conversations unclear in terms of point and plot--- and I've seen the movie countless times.

It's a shame Van Sant went down that road (the characters, specifically Keanu, breaking in and out of classical speech, which simply doesn't work), because there are many things about this picture that are really terrific... So view it with this in mind.

...and this: after the first couple of viewings of this hauntingly-odd picture, the flaws just seem to melt away and don't matter so much.

And you can almost always tell a (potentially) good flick when it manages to inexplicably capture the zeitgeist of its era; in fact, I'm not sure I've ever seen one that evokes the very-late 80s/very-early 90s as vividly. (So did ""Midnight Cowboy"" for ITS era, so maybe male hookers is all that's really required. Go figure.)

But this one's a bit beyond that, which demands some praise ...and caution.

This film is basically about two young men, Scott, played by a very young Keanu Reeves who likes to break out into stints of Shakespearean dialogue in the telling of this modern day tragedy. Scott comes from a wealthy family but acts like a homosexual vagabond just to pi$$ them off.

Mike, played by River Phoenix, gives an excellent performance as a homeless, narcoleptic, male prostitute who's in love with Scott but can't seem to make their relationship happen. Scott constantly comes to his rescue whenever sleep forces itself on Mike.

Against these characters Portland, Oregon lives, they travel around, looking form Mike's mother, who'd abandoned him as a child. Mike has never gotten over the trauma of this and anytime he's asked to have sex with a woman, his mind reels back to images of his mother and he goes into one of his narcoleptic spells (stress-related).

But after finishing the film (I was able to finish watching it) I wondered about its message. What was the point of showing us these damaged people? What were the film makers trying to get across to the audience?

The movie begins half hearted and detached, like the characters themselves, and culminates into an emotional downpour that climaxes during the campfire scene, which to this day is some of the most intense acting I have experienced (River).  The two characters (River and Keanu) move from being detached emotionally and sexually, perverse, to intimate and close, to once again, detached and separate.  The movie leaves you with an overwhelming feeling of despair over the things in life which lead us away from all that is pure and intimate (power/social status and money).  This pattern of association then dissociation embodied in the character Keanu plays is offset by the purity of River's character who stays true to his sense of self, and ultimately suffers, and possibly disappears from existence at the conclusion of the film.  The schism inherent in the American aristocracy is exploited in full depth.  The wealthy lie with the poor as it conveniences their need, but turn their backs in fair weather.

640789,5,6303422969,"My Own Private Idaho, a drama loosely based off of William Shakespeare's ""Henry IV"", parts one and two is a hearty look into the lives of some boys out on the street. What comes from Shakespeare's play is the concept of a young man avoiding following his father's footsteps as a government leader by keeping disreputable company and then abandoning his friends after inheriting his father's fortune, picking up a wife in a foreign country, and starting a political career. But that's not the only focus of the film, you see. The two main characters in the story, Mike (River Pheonix) and Scott (Keanu Reeves), are observed as their relationship crumbles once Scott leaves the hustler lifestyle. My Own Private Idaho isn't about being a male prostitute, though, even if there is some great documentary-like pieces of their lifestyle scattered within.

I thought it was very well-rounded and had some wonderful characters, especially Mike, the homosexual narcoleptic searching for meaning. He was often unpredictable and gets the viewer truly engaged in the film, or at least he got me into it. The settings and transitions were rather haunting, as well. There are re-occurring themes of being on the go and oblivion perfectly expressed by the scenes of Mike laying in the middle of a completely deserted road in Idaho. He keeps telling himself how familiar it all seems...so familiar.

Well-acted and scripted and brilliantly directed (with fine use of colour, recurring motifs and bold credits), Idaho possesses a rare, dream-like quality. The music too is excellent, particularly in the perfect first and final scenes. You'll never listen to The Pogues' ""The Old Main Drag"" without thinking of this movie and of its central figure: Mike appearing from the left of the frame with only a black bag and a stopwatch, of the fireside scene, and of the final line: ""This road will never end. It probably goes all... around...the world...""

Whatever you think about Keanu Reeves, River Phoenix, Gus Van Sant, or Portland, this is an intelligent, thought-provoking, and inspirational film of the 1990s. Though some may not be able to appreciate it (just don't ""get it""), I highly recommend My Own Private Idaho to those looking for something with a different scope on life.",1123200000,8,2266,5.037333333333334
640790,4,6303422969,"Having just seen this movie once 14 years ago, it's a more enjoyable experience to watch it again, because I can understand and relate to this movie better than I did when I was a teen. This film is very similar to the recent Mysterious Skin, except it's not sexually daring enough, but it succeeds as a great ""coming of age"" gay drama. This movie belongs to River Phoenix, beause he gets to deliver the more heavy duty sexual and emotional scenes, while Keanu Reeves often times seem very fake dued to his mediocre undertrainned acting skills. Udo Kier was very good in a supporting role, he played one of the two hustlers(Phoenix and Reeves) client.

The film chronicles the street life and friendship of Mike(Phoenix) and Scott(Reeves), and how they gradually fade away from each other's life at major pivotal points. Scott is about to inherit a lot of money and business from his dying father and he must abandon the street life by his 21st birthday, and return home to become a good son so he can redemn his status. Meanwhile, Mike is falling apart emotionally, and he continues to turn tricks on the street and abuses cocaine. He's depressed and longed to find his mother who had abandoned him when he was an enfant. His father tells him that someone else is his biological father, and gave him the information of his mother's whereabout. He would journey across  the state and all the way to Italy in hoping to find her....

This film has one memorable whimsical and sexy moment when Mike and Scott fantasized about being on the cover of some porno magazine covers along with numerous other sexy hustlers on various covers, they start to talk on the covers. The Shakespear style group scenes didn't feel right for this movie, since the individual scenes were more captivating.

  To compare it to some films of similar theme:

It's a bigger story than ""The Basket-Ball Diaries"" in scope and execution.

640883,5,6303422969,"Well, here's a nice treatment of a weird classic.  Brilliant and bizarre, ""Idaho"" is both deliberately and incidentally campy.  Its extras are terrific, and its visual poetry receives terrific color and clarity.

The story of a pair of young hustlers, which opened the mainstream arts to the very subject of male prostitution (the film ""Johns,"" the novel ""Sarah"" etc.), seems to be passing the test of time.  How quirky is this film?  An early scene features oral sex being performed by a stocky aging john on a handsome but drowsy Mike Waters (River Phoenix).  We learn about Mike's narcolepsy, a condition which has him fainting into sleep at moments of stress.  This gives Gus Van Sant's tendency toward abstract cinepoetry full reign, and he depicts Mike's dreams of shooting stars and salmon swimming upstream, of houses crashing to the road.  Mike, the trailer park product of his mom and brother, is loveless and lost and seems not to mind disappearing into his lush dreams full of symbols of seeking home.

Then there is Scott Favor (Keanu Reeves), a slumming aristocrat who enters the world of hustling as a gesture of rebellion against his father, the staunch and proper mayor of Portland.  He becomes Mike's guardian angel and companion in the hustling trade and then his partner on a vain search for Mike's mother.

Along the way, some pretty colorful characters crop up.  Back when Twain wrote Huck Finn, picaresque meant escapes and scrapes, chases and searches having to do with violence and action.  Since sex is the new violence, road pictures like ""Idaho"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" feature erotic rather than pugilistic encounters.  The coked-out Bob Pigeon playing Falstaff to Scott's Prince Hal.  The clean and clownish Daddy Carroll, who's erotically stimulated as Mike tidies his apartment dressed as a little Dutch boy:  ""Scrub little Dutch boy...faster!...harder!""  A German performance artist who dances with a lamp before engaging Scott and Mike in a little light S&M.  Strange but funny scenes that make hustling look sort of entertaining.

But the less famous cast, including real street kids from Portland, are caught in their hang-out spot discussing the dangerous and less savory aspects of selling one's body.

Van Sant clearly adores the quirky individual and the poetically rendered wide open space.  He uses music very well here, as is necessary in a strangely plotted hallucinatory film.  Folk western yodeling fills the opening scene with ethereal beauty as Mike walks alone on black ribbons of empty potato-belt highway.  A crooned Rudy Vallee love song ""Deep Night"" makes an ironic comment on the shallow liasons of prostitution.  Madonna's ""Causing a Commotion"" bubbles in the background as a red-headed hustler describes being beat up by his john.  These song choices, stylistically all over the place, nearly define the term off-beat.

This 1991 film catches famous director Van Sant in the midst of a transition between gay art film of the Jarman/Fassbinder/Cocteau/Pasolini variety where boy-love is celebrated and satirized to his mainstream pictures like ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""Finding Forrester"" where it's sublimated and coded.

In a way ""Idaho"" is a beautiful mess--a cinematic carnival with talking centerfolds (Keanu Reeves!), confessions of incest, gritty street kids...cribbing Shakespeare(!), clouds in swirling slow motion, utter theatricality, utter naturalism (Mike's moving fireside chat with Scott), and a futile quest with no pay-off but the journey itself.  To me, that's pay-off enough.",1111622400,8,3548,5.253996447602131
640884,5,6303422969,"Gus Van Zant's films have been incosistent to say the least. It borders on sheer shameless commercialism (Good Will Hunting and Pyscho), of which he parodies so well in ""Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back"", and on abstract objectivism (Gerry, Elephant).

Essentially a treatise on true love and friendship. But throw in a few interesting elements (gay prostituition, narcolypsey, hillbilly yodelling, bumpy Pacific Northwest roads and highways), and a couple of teen idols (Keanu and River), this makes a wholly new original film.

""My Own Private Idaho"" speaks of lost dreams, loneliness, the heart-aching yearn to be and feel at home that could only be reached through the sub-consciousness of one's fantasies and dreams. Phoenix's character, Mike Waters, whose narcolypsey provides a convenient plot device to feature his inner most desires as well as an excuse for voice-over narration. Not that I mind, since you don't come across many movies whereby the main character suddenly collapsed and fall into a deep sleep.

This movie displays the most impressive utilization of Shakespearan text transplanted into contemporary context. Who could have thought that degenerate lowlives like street hustlers, drug dealers or even Keanu Reeves could spout out such lyrically beautiful lines so effortlessly, when one expects ghetto lingual fraca.

This little indie film that was released way back in 1991, was at last given a breathe of life, in the form of DVD, courtesy of Criterion Collection. Featuring an astonishingly new transfer, this film never looked any better in any other home video format. Not to mention the bucket loads of extras on the 2nd disc! I am personally overwhelmed. Once again, Criterion has proved itself as the benchmark leader in setting the standard for all DVD releases to follow.",1111622400,4,1805,5.256944444444445
640885,5,6303422969,"Existence originates from a biological father and mother that conceive offspring which they nurture into childhood and later adolescence.  Eventually this teen turns into an adult who often is a reflection of what the child acquired or missed during the years of parental rearing.  Thus, existence is the accumulation of what the parents have provided for their beloved child.  My Own Private Idaho depicts Mike Waters' (River Phoenix) existence, as it shows that he desires to experience fond childhood memories.  The internal desires appear in Mike's dreams, as he often falls into sudden slumber that habitually crawls upon him through his sleeping disorder, narcolepsy.

The story opens in a remote location in Idaho, along a rarely traveled highway, where Mike stands and waits for someone to pick him up.  This moment has symbolic value to Mike's existence, as he seems to be stuck somewhere in his own development while he waits for someone to save him from his isolation.  Yet, no one comes to his rescue as his narcolepsy takes control of him and puts him asleep.

For much of the film Mike seems to be asleep while dreaming of his mother and his youthful years.  Dreams generated through his narcolepsy create an imaginative haven of warmth and motherly care.  In essence, the narcolepsy gives the impression that it is a defense mechanism for Mike, which appears to be triggered during stressful situations.  The narcolepsy also has a symbolical value as it shows his innocent search for motherly affection and his vulnerability, which can be compared to a child's defenselessness to exposure unless someone is taking care of the child.

Despite the condition that Mike possesses, he drifts around in Seattle making his living as a male street prostitute that sells his body to those who want to buy his company for a few hours.  The few hours provides a small opportunity for him to receive some form of affection, which he desperately needs.  When an older woman picks him up for the services that he provides he has a narcoleptic attack since the woman reminds him of his mother.  Two young men that are also visiting this woman carry Mike out.  One of these men is Scott Favor (Keanu Reeves) with whom Mike eventually falls in love.

The second time Mike meets Scott is in the arms of him, as Mike is recovering from a bout of narcolepsy in Portland.  In Portland the audience gets to meet a wide range of characters that all have a dark and muddled past from which they all seem to try to escape.  One of these characters, Bob Pigeon (William Richert), brings to mind Charles Dickens' Fagin from Oliver Twist who is the leader for a group of young thieves, which is cleverly woven together with a Shakespearean touch.  The combination of Scott and Bob brings to mind two infamous characters, Prince Hal and Sir John Falstaff, from Henry IV.  This scene seems to be out of place, yet it somehow the director Gus Van Sant pulls it off and makes it credible.

Scott, the son of the wealthy Mayor of Portland, provides a similar image, as Prince Hal does in Henry IV.  First he is supportive of his friends, as he set out with Mike to find his lost mother whom he has not seen for many years.  Along the journey they begin to drift apart, as Scott begins to embrace his roots in the aristocracy of Portland.  Mike is left to his own device, as Scott turns his back to the world in which he learned about belonging, human cruelty, and love.

Van Sant gives the story an artistic touch through Shakespeare, wonderful mise-en-scene, and how he frames each scene, which provides a vision that travels on a path between slumber and consciousness.  Emotions drift with the characters' actions, as they help in building a mutual foundation that rests on their unstable backgrounds.  Backgrounds without nurturing love and affection seem to leave people in a state of sadness, melancholy, and despair while trying to find their own existence through others.  Van Sant delivers this notion together with several other ideas to the audience in a complex, dark, and disconnected tale of belonging, love, rejection, and much more, which leaves the viewers in deep contemplation.",1111536000,4,4178,4.820476858345021
640886,5,6303422969,"Van Sant skillfully legitimized everyday existence with Mala Noche (1986) and Drugstore Cowboy by presenting fascinating explorations into street life. These films never exploited or romanticized their rather seedy subject matter, but viewed the characters impartially, leaving it up to the viewer to make a value judgement. My Own Private Idaho is arguably his best effort to date because it is his most personal project, a labour of love that shows a filmmaker at the apex of his powers.

My Own Private Idaho didn't break any box office records or win any Academy Awards, but it has endured. For a film that made so many studio executives nervous, it does not go for the shock value of its subject matter. Van Sant presents his hustlers as real, three-dimensional characters with humanity and the capacity for tenderness and humour. What could have become exploitive trash in the hands of a lesser talent, becomes a touching, poetic quest for family and identity that aspires to a level that most films only dream of attaining.

In lieu of an audio commentary, the second DVD features a two-hour conversation between Gus Van Sant and filmmaker Todd Haynes (Far From Heaven). This track is loaded with many wonderful insights into how the film was made.

""The Making of My Own Private Idaho"" is a retrospective documentary that features the insights of key crew members, editor Curtiss Clayton, directors of photography John Campbell and Eric Alan Edwards, and production designer David Brisbin. They gush about working with Van Sant and what a personal, unique project, unlike any other they had done before or since.

""Kings of the Road"" examines the elements of Henry IV and Orson Welles' Chimes at Midnight (1965) that Van Sant integrated into his own movie. Film scholar Paul Arthur speaks in rather academic terms in this informative extra.

There is also an engaging conversation between the film's producer, Laurie Parker, and River Phoenix's younger sister, Rain. The two women do not dwell on River's tragic death but rather focus on his work.

A real treat for fans are six deleted scenes that include more Shakespearean-influenced dialogue as Scott stages a mock encounter with his father as played by Bob (Richert). Another scene finally reveals who exactly picks up Mike at the end of the movie.

Also included is an hour-long conversation between JT LeRoy and Jonathan Caouette. They talk about their impressions of the film and about the authenticity of its depiction of street life. Van Sant makes an appearance and answers some of their questions.

Finally, there is a 64-page booklet with an insightful review by Amy Taubin, Lance Loud's excellent on-the-set article (originally published in American Film magazine) and interviews with Van Sant, Phoenix, and Reeves (that originally appeared in Interview magazine).",1110758400,10,2836,5.123376623376624
640887,5,6303422969,"The setup is simple - one poor boy (the narcoleptic Mike) longs to find the comforts of a family, while his rich best friend (son of the mayor,Scott)rebels and does anything to escape his.  But then you realize the movie is about male hustlers who somtimes speak Shakespeare, and the story is told in a fractured way to mirror Mike's condition.  The film was cobbled together from three scripts, and also improvised at points (most notably at the campfire scene).  It was a film Van Sant wanted to make for a long time, and it's a loving portrait of street kids from Portland.  It's also the best Keanu Reeves performance to date, and the most moving performance of an actor who left us too soon - River Phoenix.  It's more about creating a mood than telling a story, and it was probably the harbringer of the entire ""grunge"" movement of the early 90s.

The Criterion edition has a beautiful transfer along with a rich soundtrack.  The movie literally looks better than it did even in theatres.

640979,5,6303422969,"Being fairly new to the world of 'art-house' movies, i first found this a little confusing, and i was concerned that this strange approach would hinder the emotional impact of the film, rendering it yet another overly stylish, powerless and incomprehensible piece of modern film-art. I had also heard that it was extremely shocking and controversial. However, i began to understand Gus Van Sant's language, and it soon seemed completely natural. The claims regarding its explicit sexual nature have been, fankly, grossly exaggerated and probably the result of mild homophobia. The camp fire scene is the most memorable, with River Phoenix's perfomance as Mike, subtle and shining as usual, bringing to mind the very similar camp-fire scene in ""Stand by me"". Having only seen Keanu Reeves appear in such films as 'Speed' and 'the Matrix', in which he hardly demonstrates any power or skill as an actor, it came as somewhat of a pleasant surprise to see his humorous and striking portrayal of Scott. A sensitive choice of music contributed to the mood, both in the comic, nostalgic steel-string guitar to the gentle folk song that plays as Mike vows through tears to find his mother (by the way, does anybody know what that song is or how to find out?). I was slightly disappointed and depressed by the ending, which is extremely inconclusive, but i suppose movies don't always need a conclusive ending to make them good.

640981,5,6303422969,"When *My Own Private Idaho* hit the rental shelves of the local movie theater way back in the early 90's, its reputation spread immediately among the young and restless of my small, conservative home-town.  The consensus was of near-unanimous disgust, with common descriptions including ""sick,"" ""depraved,"" and that age-old chestnut ""Confusing"" with a capital ""C.""  And yet my opinion was, typically, not that of the consensus. My artist's spirit identified with the wanderlust-yearning and puckish wonder inhabited in the vagabond Scott and Mike - a somewhat-sheltered mind's nave lust for that opposite of its own experience. Although I certainly found myself shocked by the depiction of homosexual prostitution, the romantic tone and Shakespearan prose-play helped to penetrate (so to speak) this gutterpunk-fantasy firmly into the deepest reaches of my life-thirsty cerebrum; if anything, I found the homophobic snarls of my teenage compatriots in regards to this film more disturbing - on an immediate, reactionary level - than any fantastical degradation the film itself presented.
Immersed in that heady sensation of nostalgia and curiosity, I looked forward to a mature re-viewing of this art house masterpiece: of filtering Van Zant's intentions through an adult lens.  Accordingly, I found that which impressed me most as a child seemed less important to my current mindset, and vice versa - no longer was I wholly enraptured by the wide-shots of empty highways and the plethora of bizarre chance encounters (elements so common to life on the road): having Kerouac'ed my way across the world, I must admit to preferring my own experiences to *Idaho's* hodge-podge questing.  Consequently, the depiction of street-life squalor, early 90's-era Portland style, resonated far deeper this time around: a bell-toll for the doomed.
River Phoenix shines in perhaps his defining role as Mike, a homeless narcoleptic endlessly conking out in moments of stress, shivering and twitching in ecstatic remembrance of mommy dearest and sharecropper-esque glory (decrepit farmhouses and dust-bowl potato-sprawl): several scenes, including his breakdown at the fire and romper-stomp at the funeral, shine with a quicksilver talent so brilliant that it easily transcends the drug-addled ghost Phoenix was already beginning to become.  As for Keanu Reeves... well, I've always been of the opinion that he is the most underrated of H-wood's golden A-list, a man with deep presence and charisma, hampered by a stoic demeanor and tonal limitations.  I must admit I found it rather disconcerting to see Neo preening on the cover of a porno-rag: still, Reeve's subtle reactions to Fat Bob and Mike's outspoken coat-tail riding; his recitation of Shakespeare, Henry V style, with a cowboy twang thrown in at the pivotal tension-trigger; and finally his ascension from rebellious naf to ""master of the universe""-Reeves gives an outstanding performance, among his very best (though this may come across as an oxymoron to some - so be it).
Moreover, the very tools that romanticize *Idaho's* ne'er-do-well protagonists -- Celtic rhythms, lurid colors, Ye Olde English capering - also flip-side emphasize the constant-trauma and grimy exploitation of the LCD rent-boy's raw existence, with suffering only alleviated via spurts of snorting, drinking, mischief and, perchance, a miraculous stranger's unexpected generosity.  As Fat Bob and Mike's illusions of wealth-an eternal party utterly devoid of street-life cost-unravel, the subsequent denouement is immeasurably augmented by the early 'warmth' of the film, and the steady chill that seeps through the cracks, numbing body and mind, overwhelm its progression until abrupt collapse upon the desolate highway of the ending.
A few noteworthy scenes: When Fat Bob coldly warns Mike about ""Living on yer [arse],"" the horrific undercurrent ramifications cut the usual tongue-wag riffing like a knife.  Likewise, near the movie's conclusion, when Mike slumps into his ump-teenth narcoleptic fit on a filthy concrete street, the camera pans to Scott newly-settled in his seat of mobile power, enforcing the inevitable destiny of these lost souls, harlots high and low: one elevated to the highest reaches of society, the other forever abandoned to the cold stone and cold hands of the Outskirts.
*My Own Private Idaho:* a paean for the lost and lonely, the gutterpunk romantic in us all.  Five stars.",1074470400,139,4427,5.4605263157894735
640982,3,6303422969,"Mike (River Phoenix) is a scruffy, narcoleptic street hustler who never had a home. Scott (Keanu Reeves) had a privileged upbringing as the son of a wealthy and respected man, but committed himself to exploring life's seedier side until he reaches the age of 21, when he will inherit his family's money and responsibilities. The two young men are best friends, often hustling and stealing together on the streets of Portland and Seattle. Mike's desperate search for love leads them to Idaho and beyond in pursuit of Mike's mother, whom he knows only as a distant memory.

""My Own Private Idaho"" presents an unusual and abrupt mix of numerous storylines and characters that don't always mesh. Writer/director Gus Van Sant based one of the storylines on Shakespeare's ""Henry IV"". Van Sant's Scott is analogous to Shakespeare's Henry, Prince of Wales. Scott's thieving streetwise mentor and facilitator, Bob (William Richert), is analogous to Falstaff. And Mike could be compared to Poins in ""Henry IV"", but only in that he and Scott are good friends and partners in mischief. Van Sant has gone so far as to use some Shakespearean dialogue, which is better incorporated than I would expect in a movie about modern hustlers, but it has some awkward moments nonetheless. So at the same time we have Scott being Prince Harry, we have a road movie, a pseudo-documentary in which hustlers recount their first ""dates"", a drama about the relationships that develop in the sexual underworld, and the story of Mike's search for someone to care for him, in between narcoleptic episodes. A peculiar aspect of Mike's character is that, whenever a scene is on the verge of an emotional climax, Mike falls asleep. I have never seen a movie in which scenes are not allowed to play out because one of the participants konks out at the first twinge of stress. It's simultaneously funny and tragic , as we come to understand that nothing will ever be resolved for Mike.

Keanu Reeves does some of his best work in ""My Own Private Idaho"". He imbues Scott with such energy and charm that we can easily understand why everyone finds this young rogue irresistible. And there is that shrewdness beneath it all that he borrows from Prince Harry. River Phoenix gives a one-note interpretation of Mike. That note is Needy. It may be all that is required in this role. We need only understand that Mike needs love. Anything beyond that is probably superfluous.

""My Own Private Idaho"" is disjointed in both its visual style and its themes. It meanders between too many disparate elements that never congeal. Its many stories are not actually dependent upon one another. Some of the film's scenes have such impact that they are stuck in my mind as I write this, but most run together. Keanu Reeves' performance is the best thing about the movie. So I recommend ""My Own Private Idaho"" to his fans and to his detractors.",1074384000,4,2887,4.828282828282828

The only thing that might be considered a problem with this movie is the ending.  I personally wanted Scott to pick Mickey up at the end and say he was sorry he left for a an annoying Italian girl and a father who was a jerk.  Who could ever leave that beautiful man?,1072051200,2,527,4.127450980392157
640984,5,6303422969,"Most people seem shocked when I tell them that ""My Own Private Idaho"" is one of my favorite movies ever, though I don't see why. One of Gus Van Sant's lower budget films, this melancholic adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Henry IV"" to the American West (chiefly Portland, Oregon and all around the western states) follows the adventures of a road-tripping prodigal son of wealthy and powerful politician (played to perfection by a reflective Keanu Reeves)and his best friend, a narcoleptic prostitute (a visionary performance by the late River Phoenix).
""My Own Private Idaho"" is a marvel: dreamlike, eerie, haunting, constantly engaging, often surreal. There are a handful of films I have seen that completely transport me out of the feeling I'm seeing a film: this is one of them. The film's first haunting image of River Phoenix, alone, on a desolate stretch of Western highway, taken by his sickness, has to be seen to be believed; the eerie ""Riding the Prairie"" is a perfect complement to this movie about two strangers in a very strange land, journeying among the hustlers, hookers, con-men, schemers and bon vivants in the modern American West.
The plot is loose and rangy, and like its subjects, Van Sant uses it as needed to move the story along: Phoenix's character wants a reconciliation with his estranged mother, and certainly peace with himself. Keanu, sensing debauchery and fun, tags along, and the movie rambles about with them, taking note of their adventures and their pursuers (particularly delightful and outre is their awkward and funny tryst with an older woman, spoiled by Phoenix's narcolepsy, and a splendidly funny turn by Udo Kier as Hans, an unbearably kinky German john who simply will not be left behind).
For all its strangeness, there is a rich, empathetic core at the heart of this movie. Interviews with the film's young, hip, pierced and tattooed street prostitutes are funny, free-form, almost documentary in style, and often surprisingly moving, but the film is not hackneyed or saccharine; Van Sant has too much respect for his characters to ever stray into preachiness or movie-of-the-week (""this week: battling child prositution!"" tone is not to be found here) territory.
The cinematography of ""My Own Private Idaho"" is lush and alluring, and the story and travels of its young and naive (albeit experienced) protagonists are fresh and intriguing enough for Van Sant to have neglected the tie-in with Shakespeare. That said, the allusion to Keanu as a treacherous Prince Hal, ready to sell out his friends to take up his destiny, doesn't harm the movie, and even accentuates its tragic tone---not to mention that indie-director William Richert is amusing as a latter-day Falstaff.
""My Own Private Idaho"" is certainly not for everyone, and to many will seem contrived and inaccessible. But for the discriminating viewer who welcomes the opportunity to have River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves serve as tour guides into a strange and unsettling landscape, it will very likely prove unforgettable.",1058572800,91,3025,5.125506072874494

641095,3,6303422969,"Very loosely based on Shakespeare's Henry IV part one, MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO actually incorporates great chunks of the Bard's play into its script--and the result is an film with an experimental edge that doesn't really come off.
Keanu Reeves is the son of a wealthy and influential man who has become a street hustler largely in order to infuriate his wealty and influential father--and hence director Gus Van Sant's recourse to HENRY IV.  His closest friend on the street is River Phoenix, a narcoleptic prostitute who dreams of finding security by reconnecting with his trailer-park-trash mother.  Together the two go off on a road-trip spree complete with a Falstaff figure and interspersed with takes on other teenage boys plying their bodies on the street in order to survive.
Reeves gives one of his better performances here and the supporting cast is very good, but the heart of the film belongs to River Phoenix, who works miracles with the pathos of his role.  It is largely due to his performance that the film is able to hold our attention.  But the adoption of Shakespeare's lines, particularly since the film skips in and out of them from portion to portion of the film, seems extremely out of place, and the film as a whole never seems to find a cohesive visual style. Worse still, one is never entirely certain what point Van Sant is trying to make, and the uncertainty doesn't seem intentional on the director's part. Final thought: interesting, but slightly pretentious and and not entirely successful.",1024185600,59,1519,4.898832684824903

This is probably the movie which inspired me most. It is shockingly sensible, outrageously characterized, immensely involving and fascinatingly dialogued. Needless to say, the acting is superb. Both Keanu and River present themselves as the most realistic couple I have ever seen on the big screen. Gus Van Sant is a camera wizard who really put a spell on me w/ this movie.  I am one of those who do not like a movie just because of the happy ending. However I felt so emotionally close to Mike that I remained quite sad at the end. I wished that he'd find a real friend to help him coming out of his numerous and continous disillusions and mishappenings.
What I liked most in the movie? The fact that it moves to our southern europe (Italy). The Shakesperean literature was maybe a bit out of place, but it certainly helped the characters to gain some kind of 'bright' background - something which could not have been showed otherwise.",997401600,3,1037,4.7292817679558015

I've been an admirer of both River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves, and this is definitely there best  work.  The movie was less to me about male hustlers and more  about the beautiful friendship between Mike (Phoenix) and  Scott (Keanu's character).  My two favorite scenes in the movie are 1).  The campfire scene where River's character soulfully and painfully shares his love for his friend...braving rejection.
It was incredibly believable and River's emotions were overflowing with reality.  It appeared to me that both River and Keanu had developed a strong bond in this movie.  It showed in this very beautiful scene.  2) The trailer scene where River's character meets with his older ""brother"".  It was so heartbreaking!  It was pretty obvious to me where Mike (River) developed his narcolepsy...incredible scene.  I give Gus Van Zant a standing ovation for this movie...well done!",991785600,9,969,5.056962025316456
641099,3,6303422969,"The title is inspired and River Phoenix does an excellent job in a very demanding role.  The eclectic script is okay, but I found Gus Van Sant's stagy direction a little distracting at times and the embedded messages annoying: Yes, street urchins are human too; and yes, a man may love a man over and above sexuality, even if he is gay; and indeed, one may find poetry in the most wretched streets and even among the most desperately lost.
On the other hand, what is a disease? and what is society's attitude to what it perceives as diseased? and what is the value of an open road and sky blue vistas? are questions tantalizingly expressed.  They really make the film.
Henry IV comparisons?  They were slight, and anyway, let's not get Falstaff spinning, and leave Mistress Quickly alone--please!
By the way, I'm sure Van Sant did not intend to suggest that narcolepsy is a result of incest, but some narcoleptics might squirm a little after the trailer scene, and I don't think Idahoans appreciate being made to look like in-bred bumpkins.",989971200,8,1040,4.7032967032967035
641100,2,6303422969,"Van Sant's pretentiously artsy revision of Prince Hal's tale fooled some of the public (by featuring a couple of attractive adolescent boy actors?) & most of the critics (gay adapted Shakespeare is doubly bulletproof?) very nicely. But it's empty underneath, finally as simple-minded/self-indulgent as the more honest (thus more obviously terrible?) adaptation of ""Even Cowgirl's Get the Blues"" that would follow. The neo-realistic straight businessman & gay hustler milieu is barren, excludes the mix of bright curious variations essential for the rise/fall of a Falstaff (or any other complicated human being). We get types, caricatures instead of characters. Does anyone know anything about bikes? Or anything else? Nope. That's fine, & rushing idle youths into adult duties CAN be one of the harsh facts of civilization, often. But is incuriosity itself beautiful/smart/funny? The ethos is NOT new. Shakespeare himself did wonder about feckless ignorant boys taking over The Globe in ""Hamlet"" (though this should be & usually is edited out, cut). Van Sant's peripheral punks describe their horrors blithely, as badges of honor, while his leading punks plot betrayal (rich white kid) or project immense vague troubled sensitivity (poor orphan). Bob/Falstaff must be denied, per the original, but the fool/prince connection is weakly made, spoken not realized, unconvincing. ""My Own Private Idaho"" is juicy boys on the road to nowhere. Again. Still. A more generous gentle viewer might try harder to believe any of this?",989452800,8,1522,5.480851063829787

River Phoenix portrays a person with Narcolepsy and I know this sounds really bad, but it makes him appear to be like this little puppy, you just want to cradle him. This movie has a darker feeling to it, and its definitly a movie for people who don't like mainstream movies.  Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers is also in it, he's awesome, that's all I have to say! All in all, River Phoenix was beautiful in this movie, there are just no words to define his soul in his movies, and in life...",983232000,4,645,4.366666666666666
641102,4,6303422969,"MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO is an incredible film that really has it all: two charismatic stars, a unique mix of comedy and tragedy, some beautiful imagery, fantastic dialogue, a story that manages to move along at a pretty good clip, and a terrific ending that is open to interpretation. What else could you want?
At the core of the movie is the relationship between Mike (River Phoenix) and Scott (Keanu Reeves), who are working as street hustlers in the Northwest. Mike is a lonely character, emotionally vulnerable as a result of his dysfunctional upbringing and often physically vulnerable as a result of his narcolepsy. He is a lost soul, a drifter desperate for love. Scott, on the other hand, is calculating, merely toying with street life until he inherits the life laid out for him by his father's wealth and power. Still, Scott does seem to have a fair amount of genuine affection and concern for Mike, often taking care of him during his narcoleptic attacks and going along with him as he hits the road in search of his mother. The heart of this movie is the contrast between these two and the bond between them, despite their obviously deep divisions.
River Phoenix turns in my favorite performance of his tragically brief career, and really carries the movie while Keanu Reeves, although his character is nearly as interesting as River's, more than holds his own as well. What keeps this from being a five star movie is Gus Van Sant's incorporation of Shakespeare into the script. It's a cheap gimmick that adds very little to the movie and really only serves to label the movie as a knock-off. I think most of the people who saw this movie would have seen the HENRY IV parallels in Scott's story without having the ACTUAL dialogue dropped on our heads. Still, it's ultimately a minor complaint and absolutely no reason to stay away from the film. River Phoenix's performance alone makes this one a must see.",982368000,13,1915,4.736526946107785

He is not pretentious like Brando  nor flamboyant like Nicholson, but he is human...tragic and flawed, funny  and sad, lost and searching for an identity,a home, or someone to  love.
The character in the movie always finds himself lost on a road to  nowhere that seems to be endless and permanent. Dreamy images of his youth  haunt him, and he depends on his best friend for love and companionship as  he searches for his mother and for meaning.  The movie shows Phoenix caught  between a past that he still clings to and a future that is uncertain,  while he is in the present searching for answers to his loneliness, love  and companionship.",969321600,7,907,4.439024390243903

Keanu Reeves as Scott Favour, brings the right lines to the  movie. I can't imagine anyone else playing it like he does...Scottie is a  devious deviant, his hidden agenda is for him alone to know...
River  Phoenix as Mike Waters had the part down pat, playing it with achingly good  flair.  You want to help him find his mother and end the loneliness and  unknowingness he feels. His narcoleptic episodes and bizarre flashbacks  give pace to the movie and helps the tale before us to unfold.

A few weeks later I saw him in RUNNING ON EMPTY and realised that this was t h e protagonist for my generation. In MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO he plays the hustler Mike Scott longing for normality(""I never had a normal dog"") and the supposed safety of a long-lost mother. River Phoenix excells in his best role(with Birdlace in DOGFIGHT), but he is helped by a strong cast including Keanu Reeves(his best ACTING role until he chose a wise careerchoice by accepting the actioners SPEED and THE MATRIX), Udo Kier, William Richert and Flea. Director and screenwriter Gus Van Sant has spiced this little film with symbolic touches that enhance this product, made for little money and with no apparent happy ending. Unfortunately, it seems that Gus run out of ideas after this film(note the use of clouds in his EVEN COWGIRLS SINGS THE BLUES and Marion`s showerscene in the remake of PSYCHO). And GOOD WILL HUNTING? It lacks the great style of IDAHO and his art-house films.

The issue of gay hustling is something a lot of people shy away from because they're scared of what they don't know or they're uncomfortable in  dealing with their own inadequacies about the subject.  But if you can step  through that issue then you won't be disappointed with this film.  River  Phoenix won the Best Actor Award from the National Society of Film Critics  for his performance in this film and he certainly deserved it.  The whole  film is mainly about acceptance and just wanting to be loved.  It's as  simple as that.  A few notable scenes are around the campfire between River  Phoenix and Keanu Reeves and in the trailer home between River's character  and his estranged father.

Rivers had recently finished ""Jimmy  Reardon"", if I remember correctly, and ""Stand By

Me"" was  still fresh in many people's minds.  So here comes a quirky, scruffy,  unappealing character, and his slumming, pretty boy buddy  (Keanu Reeves  before he becomes a big ticket). The scripting and camera work are artsy  (think: Fellini crossed with David Lynch), and altogether bold.

I realized very quickly that my focus was on how astonishing River Phoenix was (and his mesmerizing hair that seems always to be WILD and perfect) and how much of a loss it was to the world for him to die just a young, young man. So much talent and potential lost.

Unfortunately after the movie was over I had to do a Wiki search to figure out what the plotline was because it jumped around so much, had such an odd script and was truly just all-around weird. This movie actually gives A Clockwork Orange a run for its money on the weird scale.

One positive thing I have to say though is that I briefly felt pure nostalgia when I saw River sitting aside the campfire. It took me back to a few years prior to this role when he played Chris Chambers and the heartfelt, heart-stopping scene he and Gordy shared in Stand By Me.
