5963160,5,B00F1FVKVC,"I watched this series from the very first episode on TV when it first aired, all the way to the end, and absolutely LOVED it!  Love the show, the characters were so real and the script was awesome!  Sure miss it on TV each week!  Glad to have it on DVD now, so I can watch it all over again!  It was fun to see Lacey Chabert grow up on the show!!  She was young when it began, and grew into a beautiful young woman by the ending.  :)",1384560000,2,433,3.808988764044944

5963173,1,B00F1FVKVC,"Has anyone else noticed that it is not permitted a female on tv to actually be satisfied with anything ever for more than 2 minutes or so?  They hook up, they agree on terms, but within minutes they are saying, ""Charlie, we need to talk.""  ""Evan, something is wrong with you and I don't have the love or time or patience to bear with it.""  It's always the guy who needs to fix something and become the female's perfect partner.  Or else.  Or else she'll move to New York.  She'll find a new guy to fix.

We never see this happening the other way around.  Guys are constantly jumping through hoops to stop the whining.  They are chronically dissatisfied as well, but it's not allowed to blame females anymore, so for them it's the job.

The old wisdom was that the things of this world never do satisfy, and the way to happiness is through ignoring the endless clamorings of the flesh, making a vow, taking a stand, getting through the hard times together.  When did females become so weak, so unable to bear the slightest hardship?  Is this what liberation has brought us to?  Can we be strong, decent, faithful people when we have so much choice, when it's so easy to complain and move on?

This show is extremely demoralizing and depressing, perhaps because it so accurately portrays the spiritual vacuum most people live in.  Scary, scary, scary.",1400889600,,1349,4.5625

5963178,1,B00F1FVKVC,"Disc 3 of 5 won't play. This occurred with first shipment and the second ""replacement"" set. I tried on a DVD player, PS3, and a Dell Inspiron... What gives?! I can't be the only customer receiving this problem, twice now!

UPDATE: Amazon has been more that helpful in this matter; however, after 3 deliveries now, the same issue occurs. I did figure out a fix around the problem though. As the actual menu interface is faulty, you can select the 'menu' button on your players remote control and it tricks the DVD into thinking it's already playing all episodes in a row, you just have to skip through to get to individual episodes. Frustrating, but after over a decade wait for this last season to be released, it is better than nothing.",1391385600,8,737,4.583333333333333

8611520,5,B00F1FVKVC,"Party of Five Season 6 on DVD was awesome like the previous seasons. It dealt with all kinds of issues. Marriage, domestic violence, drugs, drinking, moving on, going to college, finding a new identity or career, and a sense of finality. The Salinger's were involved in all the episodes and they were great. I will miss this show as it was such fun to watch. The episodes are 45 minutes long. I loved the theme song, ""Closer to Free"" by Bodeans. The last episode was quite long. and it was memorable to see what happens to all the cast. A 5 star show.",1487721600,,551,4.359223300970874

8611524,3,B00F1FVKVC,"LOVE the show, but these dvd(s) are a pain.  Impossible to fast forward or rewind between frames.  You have to go through the entire episode forward or backward all over again.  Each season's discs are set up differently, so can't remember which seasons were the worst, technically.  Didn't stop me from watching, as it's such a great show, but major tech nuisance.",1433548800,,365,4.838709677419355
