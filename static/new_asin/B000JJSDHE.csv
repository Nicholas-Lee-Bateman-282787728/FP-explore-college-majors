8151314,5,B000JJSDHE,This is a gem of a dvd!  Both the Karloff and Price episodes are wonderful! And the quality of this dvd couldn't be any better!,1425340800,,127,4.08
8151315,5,B000JJSDHE,"It was a delightful idea to have these two tributes included on the same DVD. Yes, Boris Karloff and Vincent Price have genuinely scared the pants off of us for several decades.  Most people don't know that they appeared together in two movies, both starring with Basil Rathbone.  I refer to Universal's ""Tower of London"" (1940s) and the hilarously funny ""Comedy of Terrors"" (1960s).

In real life, both of these gentlemen were gentlemen and so very unlike the characters they portrayed during most of their screen and TV careers.  They maintained a passionate for interests outside of Hollywood.  Vincent, with his love and knowledge of art as well as Native American Art preservation, and Boris, with his love of a small performing arts company in Alaska.

With regard to the show on Boris Karloff, several segments were used in the Biography ""The Gentle Monster-Boris Karloff."" The full segments are seen here.  This DVD and the Biography DVD are, indeed, bookends on Boris.

Vincent Price's  performances during the years at Twentieth Century Fox were rich indeed --""Laura"", ""Dragonwyck"", and ""Leave Her to Heaven"".  In later years, he did a mixture of hammy camp and hammy horror; but his performances throughout were always first-class.  He is shown with his second wife, Mary, and children by both marriages. There was a third marriage several years later when he appeared in an English movie.  He later moved to England, where he was host of the highly-acclaimed PBS series ""Mystery.""

It is to good to relive the times when both of them were still with us.  Thanks, Ralph Edwards, for preserving ""This is Your Life"" for those of us who saw it originally and for those of us who never had the opportunity to do so.",1240876800,5,1722,4.8728522336769755
8151316,5,B000JJSDHE,"This is a must see for any Karloff or Vincent Price fan. Taken fronm the popular television show ""This is your Life"" this dvd contains both Boris Karloff's and Vincent Price's entries from this series. The show's premise was to surprise their subject, usually with the aid of a friend/collegue, bring himback to the studio, and on stage review  his life with the aid of significant people from the his or her past. Highlights for Karloff include Jack Pierce, while Vincent Price had many of his co-stars in the studio audience. Both shows offer a glimpse of the artists as people, by their reactions to the events happening around them and the interviews with their non-celeberity friends. Both shows are entertainng to watch. The dvd quality is surprisingly good and the price should suit most budgets.",1178409600,9,803,4.904411764705882
8151317,5,B000JJSDHE,"I wish someone would take the mantle that the late Ralph Edwards left.  I discovered so many little tidbits of information, while watching ""This Is Your Life"" Boris Karloff and Vincent Price.  For instance; I didn't know that Boris Karloff helped keep in existence, an Anchorage, Alaska Community Theatre Group, by performing with them and donating his acting pay and more, to building them a theater.  I didn't know that Vincent Price helped out American Indian causes.  Donating money to the Sioux Indian tribes, concerning their art, etc. That's what I like about viewing the THIS IS YOUR LIFE programs. You find out so much, that probably wouldn't be shown in just a regular documentary on that person.",1168300800,10,706,4.9576271186440675
