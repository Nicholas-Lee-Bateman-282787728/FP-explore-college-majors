WHY IS THE DVD IN PAN AND SCAN, WITH THE OVERTURE CUT ?????? STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE. TRY TO LOCATE A COPY OF THE LASERDISC VERSION.

2320843,3,B0009U7LOE,"After the success of 1973's ""Tom Sawyer"",producer Arthur P.Jacobs reunited almost all of the same team for this follow-up musical version of another Twain classic. They made a good try at it,but the movie is not nearly as good. The big problem is
J.Lee Thomopson's warm but leisurely direction,which slows down the film's pace and makes it at least fifteen minutes too long.
The Shermans provide another solid and reasonably faithful adaptation,but this time their score,although tuneful,is not as good. Still,there are things to enjoy here,primarily good performances from a top cast(Jeff East and Paul Winfield are excellent).Overall,the movie provides an evening of good family fun.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-Sawyer/dp/B0009UVCS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom Sawyer</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-Sawyer-1973-Movie-Soundtrack/dp/B0002M5T3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom Sawyer (1973 Movie Soundtrack)</a>",1319414400,,1003,7.581196581196581

All those unrealistically cleanclothed happy black faces bobbing up from their cotton picking singing happily was a turn-off right fromthe start. (U|I didn't go any further.) Of course, if you like musicals.................",1242950400,,389,5.09375

2320846,3,B0009U7LOE,"After the success the Sherman Brothers had turning Mark Twain's classic Tom Sawyer into a musical, they set their sites on Huckleberry Finn.  While it is enjoyable, it has some serious flaws as well.

The movie follows the story pretty closely.  Huckleberry Finn (Jeff East) is being raised by the Widder Douglas (Lucille Benson).  When his abusive Pappy (Gary Merrill) returns, Huckleberry decides to run away.  He's joined by Jim (Paul Winfield), a slave who is running away to freedom before he can be sold.  As they try to make it to freedom, they encounter two families caught in a feud and the conmen known as the Duke (David Wayne) and the King (Harvey Korman).

For the most part, the movie manages to capture the spirit of the book with the right mix of drama and comedy.  The Duke and the King especially steal the show, and their songs are the most memorable.  The rest of the songs are a mixed bag, nothing too exciting but nothing that horrid, either.  My biggest surprise is that the ballad ""Freedom"" which starts the movie was more power on the reprise at the end than the first time it showed up.

The book is very episodic in nature, yet somehow manages to tie it all together.  The movie never quite does that, however, really helping that feeling that few of these events aren't connected.

But the worst problem in my opinion is the ending.  They leave out my favorite episode, the attempt to rescue Jim.  In stead, they change the ending to make it bittersweet yet powerful.  Still, I think the book's ending was better.

For those keeping track, Jim is still the real sympathetic character he is in the novel.  But we do get a couple uses of the ""N"" word, which are fitting for the time period and the original novel.

This isn't really a bad musical, but it's not outstanding either.  It's a good way to be introduced to a classic American novel, but it will never replace that work.",1212364800,,1906,4.55
2320847,4,B0009U7LOE,"Seriously, this is the best Huck Finn movie available. The songs are wonderful, the characters are interesting and funny, and the actors are tremendous. You get a true feeling of solidarity between Huck and Jim and if your like me then you might have a tear in your eye at the end.

The transfer is really good, but I did notice some video distortion (snowflakes) during the ""a matter of honor"" scene. If it didn't have the distortion and there was some special features I would have given it a 5",1145836800,13,496,4.450549450549451
2320848,3,B0009U7LOE,"The musical version of Mark Twain's classic is enjoyable, but does not capture the depth of the book.  Literary satire is hard to capture on film.  The score is nice but actually seems uneven. Harvey Korman is fey beyond belief, but the rest of the cast does a nice job.  Jeff East makes a great Huck.  I wish East did more in the 1970's, except the young Clark Kent in ""Superman"".  Paul Winfield is always great, and plods along with a simple script, unworthy of this great talents as an actor.  The big disappointment is that MGM released this DVD in pan and scan.  What's the point of DVD technology, especially with the growing number of widescreen TV's available today, to replicate what's already been done on VHS?  I think it's pure laziness.  Disney is doing the same thing to new releases like ""Boatniks"", and ""In Search of the Castaways"".  That is a crime!  Even laserdisc technology of 10 years ago had all this stuff in widescreen.  Hopefully, MGM will get on the bandwagon soon!",1123804800,9,991,4.6

8066671,2,B0009U7LOE,"It worked once, so it should have worked a second time with this sequel to the much better musical, Tom Sawyer.  But problems plagued this ill-conceived adaptation start to finish.  The producer died halfway through the filming.  The director had difficulty with synchronizing the musical aspect of the movie.  Robert Sherman needed an operation while they were still working.  The actors were hard to handle.  Roberta Flack refused to sing the song Freedom as scored, threatening to sue if she didn't get her own way, resulting in no release of the soundtrack.  The acting is wildly uneven (Gary Merrill was overly dramatic; Korman and OConnell were sappy/silly as the slapstick comic relief).  The music was somber, almost a dirge, a lot of immediately forgettable tunes.  The lighting made many scenes difficult to see (dark on dark on dark).  The ending was abrupt (as though fed up with the whole thing); so they might as well just quit.  In turns it was grim, awkward, and tragic; wildly uneven to say the least.  And not all that entertaining, more to the point.",1470614400,,1069,4.877777777777778
