2323786,5,B0009UZG2I,A worthwhile purchase; the price was very good with shipping.  Frantic is the bette of the two features.  Great direction with good suspense.,1320105600,,141,5.086956521739131
2323787,2,B0009UZG2I,"I am a great fan of Harrison Ford BUT...FRANTIC was a mishmash of nonsence involving drugs and unbelievable characters including Ford. Ford's character came off as pretty pathetic and the supporting roles were without merit (no wonder, the dialogue was silly).  Not a keeper for me.  PRESUMED INNOCENT was carried by Ford and watchable.  The plot is about Ford who is investigating a murder when a series of events puts him under suspician of committing the crime himself. Worth watching once, only because of Harrison Ford.  Just my opinion - others may like it. I can't remember FRANTIC being in the cinama houses at all.  I am sure it was paired with PRESUMED INNOCENT on dvd to make some money.  Sorry folks!",1309564800,,712,4.795081967213115
2323788,5,B0009UZG2I,"Two OK films.  Anything with Harrison Ford is usually good.

2323789,5,B0009UZG2I,"How can you go wrong with two Harrison Ford DVDs for virtually no money? You can't, that's how. At least, as long as, like me, you could care less about pan and scan or full screen or any of that jazz.

OK, OK, I have to admit that, although the plotting of Presumed Innocent is cracker jack, what's with the music? John Williams really mushed up what was shaping up to be a taut courtroom thriller with a flaccid, trance-inducing score that detracts from the story. Just watch this movie and think how much better it would've been with a more muscular, tension-filled score. Plus, it's got Raul Julia being supercool as the suave defense attorney.

And Frantic: I love it. Harrison Ford is just great in this. I love how he uses the commanding and imperious gestures and arrogant finger-snapping of a internationally respected heart surgeon, and I love his impatience throughout. There's something about his fish-out-of-water thing that he does during his dance with Michelle Seigneur that is so compelling. It's true, Seigneur isn't going to win any acting awards for this one, but at least there's some sense of honesty and integrity in what she's doing. I love the slow, deliberate pacing throughout and I love the look of the film, with all those washed out blues and gray and whatever-the-hell color Harrison Ford's suits are. I've got to agree with other reviews of Frantic, though: the more you find out about why Ford's wife was kidnapped, the less interesting it gets.",1218499200,6,1478,4.792156862745098
2323790,4,B0009UZG2I,Yes it's a 2 disc set unlike the other Warners Double Feature titles I've bought that are a one DVD flipper disc. Haven't screened the movies yet but from the back cover it says that Frantic is full frame with no other info. Presumed Innocent is a flipper with fullscreen on one side and 1.85 widescreen on the other plus the package says it has the trailer..,1180224000,11,359,4.373134328358209
2323791,5,B0009UZG2I,Great seller.  Very fast shipping.  Great deal for the money. Very happy with it.,1420761600,,81,4.714285714285714

2323793,5,B0009UZG2I,"What a great combo pack of Harrison Ford movies.  2 classic 80's films, that showcase one of our most beloved American actors.  Frantic, being shot entirely in France, makes you feel like you are there with them the whole time.  Great price and 2 awesome HF movies!",1408924800,,265,4.595744680851064
2323794,4,B0009UZG2I,"Did he do it?? hmmm - this has such a twist at the end...good viewing. Harrison Ford's part in this movie was perhaps
not my choice for him - but he still played a great part.",1391817600,,175,3.888888888888889
2323795,5,B0009UZG2I,This is a great movie duo and certainly an asset to my vast collection. Arrived faster than a speeding bullit too!,1359331200,,114,4.476190476190476
2323796,5,B0009UZG2I,"I already owned these two movies, but they were in the ""snap cases"" and I am replacing all my dvd's in my collection that are in those types of cases.  The double feature pretty much ensures that I'll get a ""keep case"".  Harrison Ford is one of my favorite actors, and Frantic was okay to own.  But I really loved the Presumed Innocent movie.  It was suspense filled, and I never saw the ending coming.  Great movie.  Delivery was on time and in perfect condition.",1358467200,2,464,4.4
2323797,5,B0009UZG2I,"WE mostly think of Harrison Ford in an action-adventure movie, or in a role fighting, crooks, robbers, spies,..mostly bad guys. PRESUMED INNCOCENT is my favorite of the two in  this twin set.  It will  have you guessing to the very last minute. I think it was a great film. However Ford's  X-rated one night stand scenes ,are  pretty wild,the young lady shows up murdered the next morning and he has to prove he didn't do it....so don't have this playing with the kids around for more reasons then one. You'll see what I mean. FRANTIC,is a frantic paced entertainer. But, nothing like.. PRESUMED INNOCENT. Hitchcock would have loved it.",1346803200,2,636,4.798165137614679
2323798,3,B0009UZG2I,"Both of these movies are great movies, and the price was even better but my review has more to do with the fact that one movie had both standard and wide screen versions, but Frantic is the Full screen only version. I wish the Amazon description had provided that in more detail or I would have purchased these movies separately.",1330646400,4,329,4.5
2323799,5,B0009UZG2I,This is the DVD that I wanted at a good price.  It shipped quickly to my home and worked fine was in good condition.,1326672000,,116,3.8333333333333335

8067253,2,B0009UZG2I,"The video quality on Frantic is ridiculous -- you'd almost think someone happened to catch an antenna broadcast on a tube TV and recorded it with their cell phone.  Very, very weird that they would even release something this sketchy.",1515456000,,234,4.85
