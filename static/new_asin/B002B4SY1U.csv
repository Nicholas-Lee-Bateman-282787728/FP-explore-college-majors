8360668,5,B002B4SY1U,"Love this workout! Had the original VHS and had to get the DVD.  The Firm really does work as advertised, you will see results after 10 workouts!",1513555200,2,145,4.37037037037037
8360669,5,B002B4SY1U,"This has become one of my favorite workouts.  I've been a ""Firm Believer"" since the age of 16 (I'm currently 28), working out 5-6 days every week without exception, when my mom introduced me to the Firm series.  My focus is and has always been more strength training than cardio, and I gravitate toward the older Firm workouts (like this one) because they have that focus, as well.  I'd consider myself an advanced exerciser, and this workout still provides enough variety to maintain my muscle definition.  This workout is good for all fitness levels!  Highly recommended.",1441843200,4,573,4.927083333333333

8360671,5,B002B4SY1U,"This workout is quite refreshing and challenging by giving you cardio, sculpting, and abs with a total run time excluding warm up to be  37 min.  I loved it",1407283200,4,156,4.344827586206897
8360672,5,B002B4SY1U,Awesome! Just the right amount of challenge. Choreography is easy to follow without being boring. Great  for both the advanced and novice exerciser.,1373846400,4,148,5.434782608695652
8360673,5,B002B4SY1U,"This is another DVD I found at Amazon that I once had in VHS. This DVD actually works the entire body but is a little less intense than Volumes 1, 2, 3. This Dvd is great for beginners, but with the different weights one could make this very advanced. I am very thankful I was able to find these fabulous workouts on DVD! Thanks Amazon!!!",1310083200,9,338,4.2153846153846155
