8755188,1,B01D95GVXC,"I bought this for my son, who is obsessed with horses (he has a type of cerebral palsy and has been doing hippotherapy for 12 years).  The horses in this video are the opposite of ""noble"".  They are fly-infested and tied up or penned in dirty stalls.  The audio is annoying after about 10 seconds.  I would have preferred to hear natural sounds of horse whickers, neighs, and hoofbeats.  On this DVD you hear bird calls.  ""All About Horses A-Z"" is so much better, although also amateur.  This is one of the most disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon. I can't give zero stars, so I will say the one star is for prompt delivery (my guess is they have a zillion of these in their basement)",1471219200,,694,4.375
