It was great acting and Jimmy Fallon who is usually to much for me was really great at acting and just being the character that he was playing. Drew Barrymore acted the way she always does there was nothing to different about the acting but it was great. I would watch this movie over and over again. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a wonderful made romantic comedy.
Bull Durham- Is a great baseball movie that I do not get tired of seeing,it is set in Durham, North Carolina about the Durham Bulls. There for the name most of the stuff that is in this movie is something that always happens. I found that it is just greatly written and the plot is great. It is a movie for all baseball fans.
What is great is you get 2 great movies for the price of one and unlike most movies where one is great and the other one is so so these are 2 great movies so you can't go wrong.",1247529600,,945,4.141304347826087
