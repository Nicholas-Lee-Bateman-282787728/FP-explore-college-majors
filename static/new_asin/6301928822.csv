7816712,5,6301928822,"This colorful and fast moving film from director Jim McBride about an only slightly corrupt cop in the ""Big Easy"" and the pretty Assistant District Attorney sent to investigate the department is filled with cajun spice and atmosphere. The lines between right and wrong are blurred like a rainy windshield in this lightning paced and very sexy cop film.

Dennis Quaid gives a terrific performance as Remy McSwain, a second generation cop who sold out early on in his career, accepting it as the norm but not letting it hinder him from doing his job. When the prim but sexy Ellen Barkin arrives on the scene in the form of D.A. Anne Osborne, he attempts to wine and dine his way out of trouble as the bodies start piling up in an apparent drug war.

The charged encounters between Remy and the shy Anne blend seamlessly with some very brutal crime scenes and a lot of New Orleans' music to propel this film at a breezy and very enjoyable pace. When Remy's own corruption is exposed, their relationship becomes more complicated when he tampers with evidence and gets off. But her comment to him that he is no longer one of the 'good guys' causes him to take a serious look at himself. When cops are discovered to be behind all the recent drug trouble, the answers will hit far too close to home.

A very unique cop thriller that manages to maintain a light and breezy ambiance throughout, this is one of the most memorable films of its kind. Its spicy flavor goes down easy and makes you crave more. A supporting cast that includes Ned Beatty, John Goodman, and Lisa Jane Persky, offer fine support in this very seductive and one-of-a-kind film you must see. Worth owning in any format.",1302825600,,1683,4.566225165562914
