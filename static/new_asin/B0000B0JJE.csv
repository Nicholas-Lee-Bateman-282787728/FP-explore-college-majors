Genre: purported comedy.

If you want an example of extremely bad film making, this is it. If you're looking for something to entertain you, look elsewhere.  It's like sitting through a slide show of your Uncle Bernie's recent visit to the zoo's penguin exhibit--with a droning explanation of why you should be laughing at each slide. This movie does NOT fit into the ""it's so bad, it's funny"" category.

I didn't see any evidence of anyone in the cast having acting experience. The scenes are dominated by people talking over and falling over each other, mugging as if everything should be funny. The writing (or, more likely improvising) is weak.

I didn't see any evidence of anyone in the crew having film experience.  The picture is bad. The sound is distorted. (If these things were intentional, it didn't work.) There is nothing commendable here, except possibly their success in getting it on DVD. Fortunately, bad DVDs waste fewer resources than bad VHS tapes.
