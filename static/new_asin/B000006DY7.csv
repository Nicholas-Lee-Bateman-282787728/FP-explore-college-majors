Due to a misunderstanding, the Department of Children's Services wants to put Hector in an institution. But before they can act, Hector mysteriously disappears. The other children claim that Hector was kidnapped by his imaginary friend which he calls a Bunyip. Will they find Hector? Will Hector be taken away from the people he loves?
