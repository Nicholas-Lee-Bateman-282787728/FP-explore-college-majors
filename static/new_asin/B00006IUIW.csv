Alex's drive, dedication, and passion comes through the music and is clearly heard in all he does.  The acoustic versions of The Calling's music in this video is stunning and not to be missed.",1367625600,,325,4.47457627118644
7969466,5,B00006IUIW,"This is a fantastic live music dvd, fantastic and beautiful songs sung by Alex Band! Definitly worth buying for any music lover! :)",1354233600,,131,4.739130434782608
7969467,5,B00006IUIW,"I love The Calling, and when I saw this I thought it would be a great gift for my wife who lives music. I was surprised by the personal insights of the band members and the music sounded great in the historic and special locations throughout Italy.

I loved this setup so much I've also purchased other Music in High Places products with other artists that I like. It's like a music CD, videos, and artists interviews in one.",1325289600,,425,4.379746835443038
7969468,2,B00006IUIW,"I have the Goo Goo Dolls and Collective Soul for The High Places series and they are far better than this production.  Sound and video quality were both very good but at times it just came off as phoney, canned in applause, staged MTV video. It just was not done nearly as well as the the earlier mentioned.
Was hoping this would have been a classic for the collection but I wouldnt be surprised if i don't watch it again",1238025600,,421,4.2625
7969469,4,B00006IUIW,"Rather then 2 hours of a band standing on a stage singing songs, this DVD collection takes the viewer on a journey, a tour of Italy, as we follow ""the Calling"" with lead singer Alex Band through the city scapes and countryside of Italy.  Just short of 1 hour, the collection includes the bands popular songs including ""Wherever You Will Go"" (my personal favorite), ""Could It Be Any Harder"", ""Unstoppable"" and several more for a total of 8 performances (if you count the bonus track in the DVD extras).  The extras themselves are so-so, with the exception of a ""music only"" section which allows you to simply sit back and watch all the performances without the chit-chat and extras in the full feature.  This is a really nice extra!  The performances are captured throughout Italy, all acoustic in style.  Worth adding to your collection.  A 5-star rating would have required better extras, including some of the studio version videos.",1105401600,2,934,4.8427672955974845
7969470,5,B00006IUIW,The Calling as a band are evolving and the evolution shows in this magnificant DVD featuring music videos and interviews with all the band members. The setting of many of the songs is set out so enchanting throught out their travels in the beautiful lands of Italia. It's a DVD that is worth buying and doubly worth watching over and over.,1104969600,,339,4.573770491803279
7969471,4,B00006IUIW,"It would have gotten 5 stars, but they cut Sean off the cover. I honestly bought this DVD for Sean Woolstenhulme the curly haired guitarist who left the band soon after this was made. The guitar playing is amazing, and the locations are beautiful. The clips of the band just hanging out are also funny, esp. the scooter incident!",1053820800,,329,4.593220338983051
7969472,2,B00006IUIW,"I love The Calling. I play their CD all the time. I was really looking forward to this DVD but I was more than a bit let down. I think Alex Band has a beautiful voice but when he performs live he sounds so weak and amateurish. He totally misses half the notes in each song and completely avoids any difficult notes. He really needs a vocal coach. You can see on his face that he knows he sounds bad. Also, he's a bit stiff when he performs. He puts his hands in his pockets because he doesn't know what else to do with them and 99% of the time he just stands in one place. He's no Elvis. I do LOVE their music but this band is best heard on a CD and not in concert.",1050451200,3,665,3.8613138686131387
7969473,5,B00006IUIW,This is one of the most beautiful performances I have ever seen on DVD.  I could watch it over and over again and never get tired of it.  This band will go far!!,1045008000,6,161,3.8484848484848486
7969474,5,B00006IUIW,"This DVD is the best. Lots of songs played live. You get to see The Calling with their fans, and jocking around. Beautiful place,for the shooting of the video. 58 min. of lots of fun. If you love The Calling, this DVD is for you.",1035417600,,229,4.111111111111111
