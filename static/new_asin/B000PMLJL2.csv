2827090,4,B000PMLJL2,"I love the show.  Basically an entertaining romp around the world that explores drinking cultures.  Each episode follows the same formula, Zane (the host) introduces the country, eats local food, goes to a few watering holes and drinks local brews or liqours, wakes up the next day and tries the local hangover cure.  In between, you get history lessons on the location and/or drinks.  Very entertaining show that I recommend to anyone.

Now the disappointment, I contacted MOJO initally about the DVD set.  I inquired if it would be HD-DVD or Blu-Ray discs.  Well, I was very disappointed when I heard it would be regular DVD.  Okay, I accpeted that.  I understand that they could sale alot more in the regular DVD format.  But it not being widescreen is amazing to me.  The show is shot in HD!  How do you not put it in a widescreen ratio?  That is baffling to me.  Considering the fact that most people who will even know about this show will be used to seeing it in HD, seeing it in 1.33:1 will be weird.

Regardless, I am getting it because I love the show and I want to show it to a few of my alcoholic friends.  Give this show a chance.  I think you will like it.",1185926400,2,1170,4.367441860465116
2827091,3,B000PMLJL2,"For a show that airs on an HD only network I'm confused as to why the DVD doesn't even support wide screen format.  I was really looking forward to purchasing this, but now I may just hang onto the episodes saved to my tivo.",1185321600,14,224,4.090909090909091
2827092,4,B000PMLJL2,"We first discovered this show on MOJO when we subscribed to the HDTV section of our cable.  Zane Lamphrey is great.  The show is funny, yet informative.  What a great way to learn of other cultures and see where you would like to travel to and drink!

2827139,5,B000PMLJL2,Zane Lamprey is the hilarious host of this show. Heard it recently got picked up by Nat Geo channel. Excited to see more of this,1414540800,,128,4.16

2827141,5,B000PMLJL2,"This is one of my all time favorite shows. Not only is it informative, but it's a drinking game to boot!

Invite a few friends over, have everyone bring some foreign booze, and laugh as everyone gets pissed in the classroom.",1394409600,,224,4.463414634146342
2827142,5,B000PMLJL2,"Pros

  1) This is the only way to get the product
  2) I love the show

Cons

  1) The video is not really acceptable even for a DVD (truly sub-mediocre video quality)
  2) The originals were in HD, this sucks.",1392940800,,211,4.025

2827164,5,B000PMLJL2,"I've been a fan of Three Sheets for years now. Zane is a great host, and there are countless drinking games embedded in the show, if you decide to watch with friends. Otherwise, it's just a great show about drinking cultures all around the world.",1375142400,,246,4.488888888888889
2827165,5,B000PMLJL2,"I love this show. I've probably seen every episode 3 or 4 times. It's a shame it was canceled, but Zane is coming out with a new show just like Three sheets the fall 2013 called Chug. I can't wait for it!",1370649600,,204,3.880952380952381

2827167,5,B000PMLJL2,I loved this show when it was on the air and I love this show now.  It is indeed the worlds greatest drinking show.  It is like Anthony Bourdain's No Reservation but instead of food it's about alcohol.,1349827200,,201,4.2631578947368425
2827168,5,B000PMLJL2,"Zane Lamprey hosts this fun travel show that centers itself around the various drinking cultures the world over.

I've been a fan of this show for years.  Zane is a very personable, likable, and knowledgeable host who knows how to get the most out of all of his experiences.  Fearless, he will try almost anything (type of food, drink, sport) for the show.  He knows how to interview the people in various locations and really bring out their personality and fun side.  This show is great to watch before traveling anywhere as each episode offers a plethora of fun finds off the tourist path as well as drinks, insights into each regional drinking scene (tosts, games, different types of alcohol, how it's made, where it originated, and the necessary local hangover cure). He also samples the local cuisine and engages in their activities.  Three Sheets is fun, well rounded, educational, and something that you can watch again and again - especially before you travel to any of these fun spots!

(ps - the re-watch value is great.  I've seen plenty of the episodes multiple times.)",1330214400,,1082,4.8108108108108105
2827169,3,B000PMLJL2,"I waited a long time before buying this, because I knew the first season was so short.  The price for it is more or less the same as season's 2 and 3 (which I've owned for some time).  The bottom line on this product is that it's only for a hard-core fan of the series.  As mentioned in previous reviews, the resolution is lacking.  If you have a high-def television, you will notice artifacts and a minor amount of fuzzyness.  I rate all of these shows as some of the best in the series, but I wish they'd work on a blu-ray version of the entire show.",1317686400,,552,4.121495327102804
2827170,4,B000PMLJL2,"So glad this show came out on DVD, because when watching it on cable, you always wished for another episode to follow!",1281571200,,118,4.409090909090909
2827171,5,B000PMLJL2,"Three Sheets, Zane Lampry, Belgium..AWESOME!  Three Sheets is by far the best ""drinking"" show on television.  It is not only hysterical, but very informative as well.  Zane is able to blend knowledge and humor into a perfectly delightful must watch weekly television show~! Seriously, this is without a doubt the most engaging show on television.  In Three Sheets, Belgium, Zane goes to a few local bars, drinks a few drinks,  meets a crazy American who believes he is the true ""beer hunter"", hangs with the monks and finishes with a chocolatier.  The only thing better than having Three Sheets, Belgium, on your television is owning all 4 seasons of Three Sheets!  Watch the show...It's a good show..really!",1260835200,,708,5.0
2827172,5,B000PMLJL2,"No wide screen is not much of a big deal, I also have them recorded, but now you can ""play all"" with no commercials. Plus the fact that I don't know if FLN is playing the older 3 sheets, this may be the only way to get to see them.

The SHOW is great and entertaining so that outweighs the non-widescreen IMHO, so I would go for it. The others (season 2&3) are in wide screen BTW.

2827186,5,B000PMLJL2,"Zane is the one of the best host ever.  His style is more dry and to the point, but that's right up our alley.  I have learned many new things from his show.  I have watched all of his shows on MOJO and really wanted to have the series on dvd. If you like dry humor, drinking and far off places this is worth a watch.",1229212800,,317,3.772727272727273

It's a great purchase to have on hand when you have friends over and there's nothing to watch on t.v.  Just pop in the DVD and you and your friends can enjoy watching Zane Lamprey be himself and learn knew cultures, food, and spirits all the while broadening your mind and tastes.  It really is an education on how other cultures and nationalities view the fine art of spirits.",1206662400,,490,4.247311827956989
2827223,3,B000PMLJL2,"I completely agree with the comment from Oxford, OH....Three Sheets is a HD show, but why is the network so cheap as to only produce the DVD in standard format?  I was really excited when I got this as a gift (with Season 2 on the way), but now I am asking myself why I just didn't DVR the marathon on St. Patty's Day to be able to watch it in HD.  Plus, there is no extra commentary and the cursing is even still bleeped.  What the f&@k?  With that said, Zane, you rule and make the DVD watchable regardless.",1206230400,10,509,4.06
2827224,5,B000PMLJL2,"Very entertaining as well as informative.  You have so much fun watching that you do not realize how much you have learned about other cultures (through booze) until it is over.  Oh, it is also very funny...",1205539200,,207,4.5675675675675675

2827227,3,B000PMLJL2,"This is one of my favorite shows on television.  Zane is hilarious and each show has an odd and entertaining blend of booze/comedy/travel show.  I gave this DVD only 3 stars however because there was obviously very little effort put into this set.  With how much content is available on DVDs today, the lack of extras, commentary, or better inserts with this DVD is a stark contrast.  I would still recommend buying the set, but really hope that future releases come with the extras we are all accustomed to seeing.  More content and I would have loved to give a 5 star rating.",1196121600,6,577,4.563106796116505

2827232,4,B000PMLJL2,"This is the GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH!!!  Yeah, Wringling Bros.  I said it.  Zane Lamprey travels the globe taking in the local drinking cultures and ultimatly hangover cures.  It's fun, ""Zane""y and actually quite educational.  But it is NOT a drinking game...  Heh.

The Only reason this did not get a 5 out of 5 rating with me is it is in Standard TV format.  Three Sheets is originally broadcast on an all HD channel called Mojo.  But unfortunatly Mojo overlooked the HD Format all together.  This was very disappointing, especially because I do have a Blu-Ray player and was really looking forward to an HD title from them.

The show is great regardless!  But in HD, the sites and sounds are that much more sharp and crisp.",1187136000,4,724,4.5703125
