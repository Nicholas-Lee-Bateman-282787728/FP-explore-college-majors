5198053,3,B008ZDCGJM,"A little bit disappointed in this one after the reviews I had read.  It is okay, but I wonder what it would have been like with Mitchum rather than Mature since Mitchum and Russell had such great chemistry on the screen.  I wouldn't buy it again, that is for sure.",1419984000,,264,4.26
5198054,5,B008ZDCGJM,Surprisingly good crime drama with a good cast. I liked the 50's scenery and  the interesting helicopter vs  car chase with good performances by all.,1393718400,,149,4.92
5198055,5,B008ZDCGJM,"Again, I enjoy the older movies and the acting is superb.  Content of scripts is clean and can be watched by a mixed crowd.",1384560000,,123,4.125
5198056,4,B008ZDCGJM,"1.  There's a lot of actual 1950s Las Vegas film footage interspersed throughout the movie --- gives the viewer a chance to see what the Strip looked like ""once upon a time"".

2.  The climax features a great helicopter/car chase.

3.  The movie introduced two Hoagy Carmichael standard tunes: ""My Resistance Is Low"" and ""I Get Along Without You Very Well"", both sung by Russell, both with an assist by Carmichael.  The latter song's  melody is also heard throughout the film as a love theme.",1375488000,8,491,4.705882352941177
5198057,4,B008ZDCGJM,This was a good film in the film noir tradition. I enjoyed it Jane Russell was as beautiful as ever.,1365206400,3,100,4.05
5198058,4,B008ZDCGJM,Las Vegas story is an example of 1959s cinema.  I wish Vincent Price did not play the bad guy in this movie.  Victor Mature and Jane Russel play an odd pair.  I guess I really don't have much else to say about it.  It is what it is.,1364169600,,232,3.7708333333333335

8532984,5,B008ZDCGJM,I wanted this film as it was filmed where my family lived when we moved from Massachusetts.,1471824000,,91,4.411764705882353
8532985,5,B008ZDCGJM,"Great movie for anyone interested in old Las Vegas sites.  Old cars, old clothing styles, old police uniforms all from back in ""the day"".  Jane Russell with plenty of snappy lines and Victor Mature playing the hard nosed detective with  a soft heart for Jane.  What cop wouldn't?  You might have thought that Robert Mitchum would have would have been a better match for Jane because of their screen  history but, Vic fits the bill just fine.  Not a big budget production but a really good cast in a vintage Vegas setting.  I'd watch it again.",1466467200,,542,4.572916666666667
