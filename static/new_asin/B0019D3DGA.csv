3433160,4,B0019D3DGA,"This was a pretty good best of the bloodiest brawls dvd. They didn't show the best bloodiest brawls, they only show the bloodiest brawls from the end of 2005 till now. It starts out with some of the participants talking about their experiences in these matches. It soon moves on to where Jarrett & Rhino start talking about their match at Turning Point & then that leads into the matches.

1. NWA World Championship- Turning Point 2005
Jeff Jarrett vs. Rhino
This match starts off in the ring for about 5 minutes then moves to the outside where the majority of this match takes place. They fought all in the crowd and Jarrett takes a brutal shot to the metal wall by the entrance area. Rhino even sets up a table infront of the tunnel and gores Jarrett right through it but the table doesn't really breaks. Lots of interference in this match which took away from the match. Brutal but not all that bloody. 4/5

2. Lethal Lockdown- Lockdown 2006
Sting, Ron Killings, AJ Styles, & Rhino vs. Jeff Jarrett, Scott Steiner, & America's Most Wanted
This was good but this too wasn't all that bloody and violent. There were some good spots but the true highlight of this match is when Styles splashes Storm through the table on top of the cage, and that was for sure a pheonomenal moment in the match & in TNA history. The match kind of dragged on in the beginning but it really got picked up when Sting entered the ring. Pretty good lethal lockdown but not all that gory and bloody either. 4.5/5

3. Six Sides of Steel for the NWA Tag Team Championship- Bound for Glory 2006
Latin American Xchange w/ Konan vs. AJ Styles & Christopher Daniels
Now this is what I'm talking about. Styles, Daniels, & LAX manage to have a pheonomenal match and still have violence to take place as well. This match was very violent. LAX brings out a fork into the match and uses on Daniels and that was a very gory site to see. There were some good double team moves used by Daniels & Styles in this one. Styles crossbodys Hernandez from the top of the cage which was very pheonomenal! This was just an awesome match, I really loved this one. Pheonomenace. 5/5

4. Barbed Wire Cage Match- Impact November 2006
Rhino vs. Christian Cage
This is another one that was just bloody and brutal. Christian really bleeds in this one and it was a lot. Cage was able to cut the barb wire from the top to escape but he never is able to. Christian takes a brutal gut buster on top of one of the steel chairs which it looked like it broked Cage's ribs. Very brutal, Christian really takes some punishment in this one. 4/5

5. Match of the Decade- Genesis 2006
Kurt Angle vs. Samoa Joe
I was shocked that this match was on here, but Angle really does bleed a lot here. Angle takes a hard head shot to the ring steps by Joe which busted him open. This match really turned into a brawl when Angle got cut opened. There were some great impact moves and some submissions too. Angle even trys to german suplex Joe for a third time but drops Joe in mid air which looked like it broke Joe's neck. Some very close near falls & counters as well. This was my favorite match on this dvd. I really loved this one a lot. Great match and the fans are very into this one as well. Pure classic right here. 5/5

6. Late Rites Match- Destination X 2007
Sting vs. Abyss
This was TNA's version of a casket match but the casket was set up inside the ring instead of outside. Sting & Abyss takes some hard shots in this one. Sting takes one hard shot to the head with the candlestick holder while trying to stinger splash Abyss in the corner. Sting also takes a hard chokeslam on top of the casket. The crowd did chant BORING at times but it wasn't really boring at all. Pretty brutal match. 4/5

7. Texas Death Match- Sacrifice 2007
James Storm vs. Chris Harris
Now this match was very bloody. The match goes directly into the crowd as soon as the match starts and lasts out there for about a good 10 minutes. Harris does a crossbody from the top rope all the way into the crowd on Storm. Harris takes a viscious shot to the head from a steel chair by Storm. There were 2 good table spots as well. This match was very bloody and physical. 4.5/5

8. No Disqualification- Slammiversary 2007
Abyss vs. Tomko
This match got physical and violent in a hurry. Tomko really upped his game in this one and he really dishes out some punishment onto Abyss in this match. The thumb tacks, broken glass, and barbed wire bat all gets introduced early. There was one sickening spot where Tomko took a piece of glass and just ripped Abyss' forehead with it. The match did get clipped at one point but it was only after Abyss jumped off a scalfold onto Tomko but aint much is clipped. The match felt a little short to me but it is worth a watch. 4/5

9. Barbed Wire Massacre 2- Against All Odds 2008
Judas Mesias w/ James Mitchell vs. Abyss
Now this match wasn't as good as the Abyss/Sabu match but it was still very bloody and violent in its own right. There were some viscious spots with the barbed wire and the bard wire boards. Abyss chokeslams Mesias onto one of the boards but it doesn't breaks. Abyss wins after he hits the black hole slam to Mesias on the barbed wire board. Abyss really deserved this one. 4.5/5

This was a pretty good violent dvd. I haven't seen the other Bloodiest Brawls dvds from TNA but I would recommend on getting this one, not a bad collection of matches.",1217462400,3,5409,4.346534653465347

8273530,3,B0019D3DGA,"Barbwire Massacre, Lethal Lockdown, Barbwire Cage, Texas Death, any stipulation you put on a match when you find them in this collection of TNA's Best of The Bloodiest Brawls: Scars and Stitches, you're assured of one thing there will be blood. This DVD shows some of TNA's best and most violent matches from late '05-early '08 and features comments from various stars about the hard hitting contests they've been involved in.

-Turning Point '05, World Heavyweight Title Match, Jeff Jarrett (Champion) vs. Rhino: These two had a rivalry dating back to Bound For Glory in October and this was the final clash where Rhino was seeking revenge against Jarrett who cheated to win the title back a couple months ago. This wasn't a bad match, not really bloody though, starts with some early wrestling, then went all over the Impact Zone. Rhino got plenty of shots in, Jarrett resorted to dirty tactics to gain the advantage, even sent Rhino off some staging through a table. When it looked like Rhino would win there was tons of interference from Team Canada members, Rhino hit the Gore but Jeff kicked out. Jarrett hits a Stroke off the second rope onto some chairs and covers to win. 6/10, for the constant interference.

-Lockdown '06, Lethal Lockdown Match, Sting, AJ Styles, The Truth & Rhino vs. Jeff Jarrett, Scott Steiner & America's Most Wanted: Much better than the previous year's Lethal Lockdown match, it's done War Games style so one man from each team starts out and a random coin toss determines which team will have the advantage. Chris Harris and AJ Styles start out and the match stays pretty hard hitting until all are in the ring then the roof lowers with weapons for everyone. It's nothing terribly bloody, some blood just not a lot, the closing minutes are bedlam, Styles and Storm end up on top of the cage and Styles hits a splash onto Storm through a table. It ends when Sting locks on the Scropion Death Lock on Harris and he taps out. 7/10.

-Bound For Glory '06, Six Sides of Steel Match for the World Tag Team Championship, AJ Styles & Christopher Daniels (Champions) vs. L.A.X.: After a couple months of feuding with some pretty intense contests this was a way to end the rivalry and what an end it was. Some great tag wrestling by both teams, weapons get used like a fork by Homicide and the blood flows in this cage match. All four men took some hard shots against the cage wall, AJ hits a huge dive off the top onto Hernandez, later Hernandez tries a splash from the top of the cage but misses. It ends with Homicide hits the Gringo Killer on Styles and covers to win the titles. 8/10. L.A.X. and Konnan beat down both men afterwards.

-11/16/06, Impact, Barbed Wire Cage Match, Christian Cage vs. Rhino: After a few good brawls this was the blow off to their feud, where each guy won earlier matches to gain access to weapons during the bout, such as bolt cutters, a straight jacket, chairs but Rhino could call for the key to the cage door. Cage was bloodier than I've seen him in ever, he gushed a good amount and Rhino bled some also. It was a pretty brutal cage match and the end was well done as Rhino hits the Gore, sending Christian through door to the outside. So Cage wins but doesn't look like a winner. 8/10.

-Genesis '06, Dream Match of the Decade, Kurt Angle vs. Samoa Joe: Kurt's first official TNA match and it had a ton of intense build-up, maybe too much in fact cause as good as it was it didn't match said hype. Don't get me wrong its good stuff, both these guys can go, are intense strikers and know plenty of submission moves but one thing that brings it down is at one point Angle suffers a concussion that seems to kinda cut the running time short. There's plenty of hard hitting offense, both trade momentum and go for their big finishers but neither man stays down or will submit. However Kurt is finally able to lock on the Ankle Lock and Joe is forced to tap out thus ending his near 18 month undefeated streak. 8/10. Joe does offer him a handshake and asks for a rematch but Angle just walks off.

-Destination X '07, Last Rites Match, Abyss vs. Sting: It's a casket match where you call for the casket to be lowered, place your opponent in it and have it raised. The old style candle sets on the ring posts and the smoke and stuff when the casket is lowered do get crapped on by a lot of people, even the fans chant ""Fire Russo"" a few times. Don't get me wrong there's some good shots with chairs, Sting takes a candle stick shot that busts him open big time, then takes a chokeslam on the casket. But this was a fairly mundane bout outside of some weapon usage, Sting gets Abyss in the casket and closes the lid to win. 5/10.

-Sacrifice '07, Texas Death Match, Chris Harris vs. James Storm: The former AMW teammates face off in this brawl that made up for their horrid Lockdown Blindfold Match in a huge way. They fight through the crowd, all over the Impact Zone, trash cans, tables and other weapons get used. They both bleed big time, especially Storm and the close nearfalls keep the crowd into it. Chris Harris ends up taking this one to end this bloody battle. 9/10.

-Slammiversary '07, No DQ Match, Tomko vs. Abyss: This is a decent one here, since it's two bigger men featured this is a straight up brawl, they hammer each other and there's some good weapon use. There's an odd point where after Abyss takes a fall onto the stage that some clipping occurs then the brawl resumes. Abyss does end up taking this one. 6/10.

-Against All Odds '08, Barbed Wire Massacre 2, Abyss vs. Judas Mesias: After his debut in Sept. of '07, Mesias suffered an injury in Mexico that kept him out for a while we have this final clash that's not nearly as good as Abyss' Barbed Wire match vs. Sabu. However it is still violent as barbed wire boards got used, along with chairs and the barbed wire around the ring came into play as expected. Abyss ends up hitting a Black Hole Slam and he covers to win. 7/10.

So does it compare to the '06 release of ""Best of the Bloodiest Brawls Volume 1""? No it doesn't, there are some good matches to be found here but in all honesty once you watch them once you may not pop it into your DVD or Blu-ray player again.",1361923200,,6206,4.435964912280702

8273535,4,B0019D3DGA,"NWA Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. ""The War Machine"" Rhino - This match was the sterotypical formula of a Jarrett match. Wrestling, a big brawl throughout the arena, and an overload of outside interference. The match with the wrestling & brawling was actually very well but the match took a turn for the worst when ALL members of Team Canada kept interfearing in the end to cost Rhino the match.
(Turning Point '05)

Lethal Lockdown Match: Sting, AJ Styles, Rhino, Ron Killings vs. Jeff Jarrett, Scott Steiner, American's Most Wanted - This match was set under the old school War Games rules & was a very unique match. First Chris Harris and AJ Styles would start the match, then every two minutes either a member of Jarret's or Sting's army would enter to help their team. When the final member entered, the roof of the cage would lower, along with a cache of weapons hanging from it & that's where the match gets interesting as AJ Styles & James Storm go to the top & AJ hits a splash from the celing of the room through Storm & a table. Sting ends up winning for his team in the end
(Lockdown '06)

Six Sides Of Steel: NWA Tag Team Champions AJ Styles & Christopher Daniels vs. L.A.X. - Words won't do this match justice as it doesn't top their previous matches but it ranks right up there with their previous matches which were all classic tag team quality with a good amount of violence thrown in. Look out for AJ's flip dive off the top of the cage.
(Bound For Glory '06)
[Also available on ""Best Of TNA Tag Teams Vol. 1""]

Barbed Wire Cage Match: Rhino vs. Christian Cage - This cage match had various stipulations in that Christian & Rhino had certain objects (key to the cage, bolt cutters, straightjacket, chairs) that were given to them through the cage when they asked for it & the only way to win was escaping the cage.  In a nutshell, this was a match that had Christian constantly trying to win the match by escaping while Rhino was more focued on revenge which resulted in Cage being the bloodiest I've ever seen him.  Look out for the ending which Mike Tenay put best ""Christian may have won the battle but Rhino won the war.""
(""Impact"" Oct. '06)
[Also available on ""Christian Cage: The Instant Classic""]

Kurt Angle vs. Samoa Joe - The match was a disappointment in most people's eyes because they were expecting the type of dream match Angle had with Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania 21 in which they put on a 30 min. rollercoaster of a wrestling clinic. However, this heavily resembles Angle's WrestleMania 22 match in which it didn't go long (less than 15 mins.) but in that entire time, they went high impact & there wasn't a slow moment which left you wanting more as Joe's undefeated streak came to an end. It didn't live up to the hype but in that case, it was an enjoyable failure.
(Genesis '06)

Last Rites Match: Sting vs. Abyss - This was a glorified casket match but the catch is that the casket is lowered from the ceiling (complete with special lighting & smoke as it's lowered) and you must put your opponent in it & have it raised back up to the ceiling. With fake tombstones & electic candelabras surrounding the ring, this was a wrestlecrap match in the making right alongside WWE's Kennell From Hell & WCW's Chamber Of Horrors. I'll give it some credit as Sting took a chokeslam right ontop of the casket that dented the top of it (which got the only positive reaction from the crowd thoughout the whole match) along with being busted open & bled buckets like I haven't seen for as long as I can remember...including the WCW days. This honestly was just one of those enjoyable trainwrecks...don't know how else to put it.
(Destination X '07)

Texas Death Match: James Storm vs. Chris Harris - Their first match at Lockdown was one of the worst matches that year...but after this one, you'll forget that match happened because this heavily made up for it & more. This was under old school Death Match rules where you had to score a pinfall & the loser has a 10 count to get to his feet or lose. They started brawling in the crowd right from the start and went back into the ring with both men heavily bleeding throughout the match & taking some punishment like both men going through tables, being hit with their finishing moves, dueling trash can lips, and even Jackie Moore & Gail Kim getting involved. The fans described this match perfectly...""This Is Awesome.""
(Sacrifice '07)
[Also available on ""Best Of 2007""]

No Disqualification Match: Abyss vs. Tomko - This match was different than most Abyss ""hardcore matches"" in that it wasn't a non-stop weapons spotfest but a normal brawling type match between both men as thumbtacks, shattered glass, and a barbed wire baseball bat all came into play at one time or another.
(Slammiversary '07)

Barbed Wire Massacre 2: Abyss vs. Judas Mesias - The match is exactly what it was advertised to me, bloody & brutal as both men hit the wire various times cutting Abyss' arm & Judas' chest in the beginning. Other weapsons like barbed wire wrapped chairs & boards were used to at various times like Abyss getting chairshots to the head, getting crotched on the chair after trying to hit a running splash, Judas being dropped onto one board & put through another, Abyss being speared into a board before being black hole slamming Judas for the win. A violent brawl.
(Against All Odds '08)

In the end, I felt like this didn't match the 5 star quality that the previous volume of ""Bloodiest Brawls"" did in terms of hardcore violence but for the most part, the quality in the matches are here & it's something I would recommend checking out.",1217980800,4,5612,4.563058589870904
