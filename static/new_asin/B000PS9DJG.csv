8193011,5,B000PS9DJG,"""what could I want?"" were Tommaso's last words in the film to his mother and those last words set the tone for the film for this lead character. It's based on Pasolini's novel of the same title and I believe the script in the film remains faithful to it.
I read that the film has gotten bad reviews and many consider it to be nothing but mediocre. I feel perhaps those judgements were made because those critics would've perferred for Pasolini to have directed the film himself. I mean it is his story afterall. But I think the people involved in the film have done a great job. They truly captured the essence of the 60's in terms of politics and the way life was back then for the poor living in Rome.
It's a great film. Check it out if you have the chance.",1211587200,2,759,4.241379310344827
