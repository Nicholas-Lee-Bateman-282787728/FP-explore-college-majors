3891452,4,B002ASABF4,"GOODBYE SOLO is an Indie drama about friendship, despair, & hope.  Savane, a talented newcomer to the big screen, portrays Solo, a taxi driver who aspires to be part of the American dream.  As a Senegalese immigrant who grew up in a society where family & friends are the hub of one's attention & energies, Solo finds it inconceivable that life in urban North Carolina (Winston-Salem) is so different from that in his homeland.

As the film begins, Solo engages in friendly conversation with his passenger William, a sullen middle-aged customer who will become a prominent figure in Solo's life.  Within minutes the chatty Solo receives a sizeable deposit from his no-nonsense rider as a down payment for a trip several days hence that will significantly impact both men's lives.

As the story unfolds, William and Solo will come to know more about each other during the next several days than either might have considered possible when they first met.  Their seemingly chance encounter and hastily agreed upon trip will provide viewers with a revealing look at these 2 men as they struggle with each other's different views about the meaning of life, death, family, & friendship.

Rahmin Bahrani masterfully directs both men through a series of interactions that builds gradually & suspensefully to an emotionally impactful climax that seems at times inevitable & then again becomes elusive.

Fans of this genre who patiently watch the 2 main actors (Savane & West) reveal their respectively nuanced characters will find this movie both thought provoking and rewarding.",1251244800,4,1570,5.10546875
3891453,4,B002ASABF4,"Though it owes a major debt to ""Taste of Cherry,"" which the director has openly acknowledged, Bahrani's third feature is another impressive piece of work. It's better than ""Chop Shop,"" which mostly succeeded on the strength of its atmosphere despite its failure to offer a satisfying ending, and almost up there with ""Man Push Cart,"" his amazing first feature. Again, one of Bahrani's constant themes, the immigrant experience in the ""land of opportunity,"" is a constant. But the center of the film is the brief but intense relationship of a Senegalese taxi driver in Winston-Salem, NC, and a gruff, alienated old man who seems to be preparing for a mountain-top suicide. Youth and hope versus old age and disappointment, the American dream vs. its failure; family love versus family dissolution, the joy of friendship versus its price, trying to change life versus accepting what is are all deftly woven through the narrative. Like Kelly Reichart (""Old Joy,"" ""Wendy and Lucy""), Bahrani tells us little about his characters apart from what we observe ourselves, and leaves great blanks for viewers to fill in themselves. Some will likely find this infuriating, but it's true to life. We seldom get to know fully many of the people we meet. Still, you get to know the affable Solo and taciturn, embittered William very well, thanks to the script, direction and performances. The way they affect each other's lives will deeply move you if you take this film to heart.",1251244800,29,1465,4.983673469387755

Wonderful character development and gritty but good low light cinematography (in North Carolina) work really well in holding the audience... wondering which way each character will go. It's about lost and found dreams, unexpected kindness, and how some people need to control their destiny.

3891466,5,B002ASABF4,"I saw GOODBYE SOLO when it debuted on my local PBS station in 2009.  This great independent film remained with me; leaving indelible unanswered questions about moral ethics, because the story about Solo touched on a myriad of conflicting philosophical issues of conscience when we are faced with tackling life's challenges.  The film definitely left a lasting impression on me.  In fact, it's now three years later, and I'm not sure I was able to reconcile whether or not the main character, Solo chose the 'ethical' course in the end.  In this regard, GOODBYE SOLO was an excellent film because it begs us to ponder our sense of values, specific to 'situation ethics' when confronted with issues of conscience, which might be at odds with cultural/social and religious values we revere.

The main character, Solo is a taxi driver who lives in Winston-Salem, NC; an immigrant from Senegal who is by nature an optimist and gregarious.  Affable, hard working, and assertive, Solo is determined to succeed despite the challenge of trying to keep his troubled marriage from falling apart.  Yet Solo remains upbeat, while driving a taxi and attending aviation school in hopes of attaining a pilot's license.  This creates further fractures in his marriage because Solo's ambition to become a pilot is based in his desire [and determination] to return to his home in Senegal - his pilot license serving as evidence and proof of having attained the American Dream.  Amid the ongoing tension is Solo's demanding job and long and irregular hours driving a taxi he doesn't own.  These challenges of balancing a busy work schedule, aviation school, and becoming a father during a trouble marriage present Solo with dilemmas.  Yet, Solo's life becomes even more complex when he picks up a distraught weary passenger; an older man named, William.

It is the relationship that Solo develops with the troubled [and at times ornery], William which becomes the catalyst that gives depth to the film, specifically when coping with moral dilemmas amid everyday challenges.  Also, Solo's relationship with William - especially how the two men learn to interact, serves [indirectly] as the fodder for the narrative subplots about marital problems, career aspirations, stress of low-income jobs, and the light of hope which allows us to endure our everyday battles.

I purchased GOODBY SOLO as a gift for my sister, because it offers a great portrait of the human experience which is universal to us all  - the struggle we often face when examining our  moral conscience in the battle of deciding 'what we ought to do' versus 'what we ought not do'.

Senegalese taxi driver Solo asks a customer one dark night, after he books a one-way journey to a local mountain. The silent response says it all.

Goodbye Solo is a low-budget indie film, written by Iranian-American director Ramin Bahrani (Man Push Cart, Chop Shop). It is, at it's heart, a rough-around-the-edges odd-couple/buddy movie that follows the charismatic Solo (Souleymane Sy Savane) as he attempts to befriend depressed ex-biker, William (Red West), and tries to motivate him to live again (or at least to understand why William is contemplating ""jumping"").

Solo is a charming character, perpetually incandescent -- despite him struggling to keep his own life in order -- who you instantly take a shine to. In fact, it is this warmth -- juxtaposed with West's authentic depiction of a fifties wildchild (he was the best friend and bodyguard of Elvis) in world-weary decline -- that pulls you straight into the story from the first shot. At times you could be forgiven for viewing this as a simple buddy movie (the intriguing interplay between the two characters (both superbly played: one young, brimming with life, the other old and running on empty) is enough to merit viewing in itself); however, there is always that darker edge, that feeling something isn't quite right, as William's character slowly unravels, and you (like Solo) are increasingly made aware that he might actually do it.

Solo's America (small-town, North Carolina) is a modern America, viewed with a gaudy, backstreet realism (street-vendors try to sell pirate DVD's to toddlers, sex is often (though not explicitly) alluded to, and many (in fact nearly all) characters smoke); I really appreciated the director's talent in portraying this story with an authenticity that well-suited the setting and the characters. It is a very well-rounded and mature meditation on age against youth, on Western decline and immigrant integration, that left me wanting to see more of Bahrani's work.",1295308800,,2008,5.172307692307692

Those are my takeaways from Goodbye Solo and I took them away satisfied and intrigued (some will not be) and ready to watch it again in a week or so.

3891473,5,B002ASABF4,"Set in the refreshingly unfamiliar locale of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, ""Goodbye Solo"" is a perfectly realized human drama that, without question, ranks among the finest films of recent years.

Solo (short for Souleymane) is a cab driver from Senegal who becomes buddies of sorts with one of his regular fares - a cantankerous older gentleman by the name of William, who apparently has no family or close friends and whom Solo begins to suspect might in fact be contemplating suicide.  Now Solo must decide how deeply to insinuate himself into the life of a man who obviously cherishes his privacy and who keeps all his emotions and thoughts buried deep beneath the surface of a taciturn, sometimes even resentful,  exterior.

Without resorting to hyperbole, I can safely say that not only does Souleymane Sy Savane deliver the most astonishingly compelling performance I've seen in ages, but, in Solo, he has created one of the most fully actualized characters in recent memory as well.  We literally can't take our eyes off Savane as he brings to extraordinary life this gregarious, highly energetic and shrewdly observant individual who's been blessed with a seemingly infinite capacity for optimism, for seeing the good in other people, and for caring about his fellow man.  And it is the openhearted frankness, the complete lack of guile that Savane brings to the role that turns Solo into such a believable, fully-rounded and unforgettable character.  Solo may be stuck in a nowhere job at the moment, but his innate intelligence, personal drive and infectious way with people ensure he will not be there long.  Even the camera can't seem to resist Savane as it edges ever closer to his face as the movie races towards its artful, poetic and bittersweet conclusion.

As the moody and enigmatic William, Red West provides just the right note of internalized understatement to serve as an effective counterpoint to the life-affirming and extroverted qualities that flow so naturally from Solo.

Written and directed with unerring artistry and truth by Ramin Bahrani (Bahareh Azimi served as co-writer), ""Goodbye Solo"" is not only a genuinely great film in its own right, but in Souleymane Sy Savane, it contains a performance that truly is one for the ages.

I must admit that these stories build well and held my interest because of my anticipation that ""good will win out"" but then die at the end. Rent these other videos and see if you can feel the pain, hopelessness and unrelenting struggle of ""poor struggling immigrants trying to succeed in a thankless world"".

Ultimately it is, in my opinion a story about cultural differences and attitudes towards life that many new immigrants have.

3891477,2,B002ASABF4,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Set in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, 'Goodbye Solo' is about a happy-go-lucky taxicab driver from Senegal who one night picks up a passenger who offers him $1,000 to drive to a secluded site in a state park on a date about two weeks in the future. The driver ends up inviting the man to briefly stay over at his house, where his pregnant wife and stepdaughter are living. In the real world, I can't imagine any dutiful husband, allowing a total stranger into his house, as the new found guest could easily turn out to be some kind of criminal who might do harm to the family.

Once you're willing to suspend your disbelief over the cab driver's willingness to trust a passenger he knows virtually nothing about, 'Goodbye Solo' draws you in as it chronicles the relationship between the cab driver and the enigmatic passenger. The passenger is played by a great character actor, Red West. In real life, he was part of the 'Memphis Mafia', working as a bodyguard for Elvis Presley for many years and later collaborating on a tell-all biography. West is about 74 years old now and has great, tough-guy, weather beaten looks along with a deep, menacing voice.

The plot follows the driver Solo (breezily played by Souleymane Sy Savane) as he attempts to befriend the belligerent William. Before the climactic trip to William's final destination, Solo drives William to the same movie theater on a number of occasions; there, Solo notices William taking an interest in a young man behind the ticket counter. When Solo asks William if the young man is his son or someone related, William angrily lashes out, stating that it's none of his business. The angry mantra is repeated ad infinitum but Solo cannot take the hint. Finally, after prying one too many times, William slugs Solo in the face and tells him he doesn't ever want to see him again. Through his persistence, Solo manages to force a reconciliation and convinces William to allow him to bring his stepdaughter with him as he drives William to his fateful, final destination.

There are moments when Solo appears to be making headway in breaking down William's resistance to softening up. William appears to take a liking to the stepdaughter (at least that's what he indicates in a notebook which Solo gets his hands on and briefly flips through) and seems to enjoy playing pool with Solo. But William's 'senstive' side is rarely on display. It's obvious at the end of the movie that William wants to end his life but we never find out why. The film's scenarist has been teasing us as to William's motivations and only provides scant clues (such as an entry in the notebook that the young man at the movie theater is his son).

The problem with 'Goodbye Solo' is that there's no payoff. William disappears (presumably having jumped off a mountain) and we know about as much about him as we did when we first met him. The sub-plots (Solo's attempt to become a flight attendant and his estrangement and eventual reconciliation with his wife) are mere distractions. The central mystery, who is William and why is he trying to kill himself, is never answered.

Today, there are too many films where screenwriters don't know how come up with a satisfactory ending. For all its good intentions, Goodbye Solo fits into this category.

3891482,3,B002ASABF4,"This film sounded like another indie drama/Sundancy type movie, so I had low expectations going into it.  It was better than I expected, but it's still weighed down with enough problems.

The director of this film, Ramin Bahrani, said he was inspired by Kiarostami's masterful Taste of Cherry.  There are definite ""homages"" to Taste of Cherry here (long driving shots, and a dispatcher that's heard and not seen), and sometimes they're obvious, but the film isn't a blatant ripoff of Kiarostami.  The script is rather plodding and obvious in many respects, the character played by Red West is cranky and ugly without being sympathetic at all, and it makes you wonder why Solo likes the old man so much.  The film doesn't have much of a flow to it, either.  It plods along from plot point to plot point.  The subplot of Solo's troubled marriage feels like a screenwriter's convienence, and while the director ends the film on an ambiguous note, it still feels sloppy.  Kiarostami's Taste of Cherry had a very ambiguous ending, but Abbas's film was much more coherent and poetic than Goodbye Solo is.

The two best aspects of this film are the wonderful cinemtography by Michael Simmonds and the lead performance by Souleymane Sy Savane.  Simmonds's cinematography is some of the best I've seen in an indie film.  It's really quite stunning at times, especially in the finale, which has some breathtaking shots.  The performance by Souleymane Sy Savane as Solo is absolutely wonderful.  He manages to take some of the mundane dialogue and situations and make them better than they are written.  He has a wonderfully engaging presence on screen, and he really makes the film as good as it is.  I really hope to see in something in the future, as I think he's going to be a superlative actor.

Overall, Goodbye Solo has some great cinematography and performances, which make it worth seeing.  It's not entirely successful, but it's a decent rent.",1252281600,2,1942,4.854103343465046

Set in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the film is clear from the first scene that one of the characters intends to commit suicide. Although they are strangers, the other man, a Senegalese cab driver, intends to prevent that from happening. Like a well-written short story, that simple premise is the taut thread that runs through this film to its end.

Firm believers in less-is-more, the filmmakers report in the commentary that only the actors playing the two central characters knew what the film was about. Around them are characters oblivious to what's at stake and being played by performers whose performances are thus wonderfully natural. Diana Franco Galindo is especially affecting as the young step-daughter of Solo. Just as fine for this reviewer as director Ramin Bahrani's ""Chop Shop"" and ""Man Push Cart"" - and each of them is a gem. The commentary on the DVD will be especially instructive for indie, low-budget filmmakers, as Bahrani and screenwriter Bahareh Azimi focus a great deal on the production of the film.",1252022400,12,1202,5.070707070707071

Not much of a  plot, tedious, acting tiring.

8360228,5,B002ASABF4,"This is one in multitudes, an exceptional, exquisite film, whose storyline and lead are mesmerizing. Solo (Souleymane Sy Savane), a 32-year-old Senegalese immigrant taxi driver, with the heart of a saint cum urban hero, the zeal of a torchbearer, and charisma of a prophet, hears something he doesn't like. He picks up a 70-year-old man, William (Red West), in their hometown of Winston-Salem, who wants to book him for two weeks hence, for a one-way ride to a certain mountaintop in Blowing Rock National Park. This news ignites Solo's inherent goodness and propels him into savior-sleuth-distractor mode to upend any plans of William's to do himself harm. Solo perseveres, his dogged determination unrelenting. The rest remains to be seen. All the acting is excellent, including that of Diana Franco Galindo and Red West, but Savane is an art form unto himself. The writing, directing, filming, editing are exceptional -- easy, fluid, and immensely profound, all at once. The cinematography belongs to Michael Simmonds, with stellar editing by Ramin Bahrani, whose writing (along with Bahareh Azimi) and directing are so right. This is a monumental film, exquisitely and simply told. But I could shout from the rooftops how good it is!",1488931200,3,1237,5.19
