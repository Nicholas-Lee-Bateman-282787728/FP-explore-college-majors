8736257,4,B000PY4ZB6,"This is an introduction to the power of the Gayatri mantra.  It's about a young man who fulfills his fathers wishes to go to the city of Benares in India to learn something of Indian spirituality.  He arrives at the Sanscrit University in Benares and is shown many things.  It is enjoyable to watch even though the acting is not the best. This is an informative introduction for someone who is unfamiliar with the Gayatri Mantra.  The video of the city is very nice, the holy Ganga river and the views of the city are thought provoking.",1436140800,,536,4.494845360824742
