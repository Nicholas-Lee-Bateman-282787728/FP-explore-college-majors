4581235,1,B0055TGVTK,"Five minutes of video about the parks. 53 minutes of video about small towns. Lots of video with the camera pointing down as if the director thought it was cool to show video from a helicopter. There were whole sections showing parking lots, lakes, marinas and native tribes. You may think I am exaggerating but seriously, someone took a video about Utah and decided to rename it National Parks. We thought maybe they had put the wrong DVD in the box.",1356652800,2,451,4.580246913580247
4581236,2,B0055TGVTK,"I am very disappointed with the quality of this DVD vs. the PBS presentation. Panoramic views were virtually lost as all four sides of the film are truncated destroying the panoramic effect of depth and distance. Secondly, the music was so loud at times I could barely hear the narration. I did not have that problem either while viewing on public television. I've viewed this DVD on a large HD screen and small HD laptop screen. Both screens confirm that this DVD of Utah's National Parks fails to capture the film's quality ""as aired on public television.""",1326758400,4,558,4.762886597938144

8458813,1,B0055TGVTK,"Was not at all as advertised.  Maybe 10% the DVD was actually about the five parks, the rest was about the rest of Utah.  Very disappointing.  The the parts on the DVD  about the parks, very was inadequate.",1434758400,,206,4.342105263157895

8458816,1,B0055TGVTK,"If you want to see aerial movies of towns in Utah, this is the movie for you. 1% of the movie has to do with Utah's parks. (I might be exaggerating a tad, but not much.)",1419120000,,169,3.7222222222222223
8458817,1,B0055TGVTK,"There was a manufacturing label error and I didn't get Utah's National Parks. I received Utah-Portrait. It is good but not what I ordered. I decided to keep it, but I'm afraid to reorder Utah's National Parks with the chance that there will be an error again. I've never had a problem with Amazon before and have been ordering for years.",1415750400,,337,4.540983606557377
