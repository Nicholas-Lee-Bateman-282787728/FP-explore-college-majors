4526127,2,B0051T47HC,"I can't believe I paid for $14.99 for this.  With the previews, I thought I was getting a fresh Thai martial arts + dancing + popping movie, but it turned out to be the lamest martial arts movie ever.  You know, the low budget kung fu type where all you see are flying kicks and more kicks.  Not much hand to hand b/c these kids don't know real martial arts.  Also, can we find better looking actors and actresses?  I mean, geesh....  And OMG, what an unoriginal storyline, so friggin boring!  This is one of those low budget first time movie types for whoever produced it.  I don't know much about Thai pop-culture, but if these kids in this movie want their careers to excel, then they're seriously mistaken, b/c this is the type of movie that will ruin any start-up Thai actor.  Poor acting, poor action scene, low-budget, average looking actors at best = a poor movie!!!!!  Let me sum this up by saying that this movie is again unoriginal and boring.",1321056000,,954,4.46242774566474
4526128,2,B0051T47HC,"Ok, I'm going to name three movies that are better than BKO: Legendary Assassin, The Man From Nowhere, and Detective Dee. Bangkok Underground could've possibly been better if the director himself did not insert himself into the movie as if presence meant anything to anyone. The action at best didn't get good or believable until the end! For those of you that see this movie you'll probably be thinking that it reminds you of Tekken, Mortal Kombat, or Street Fighter in the sense that you might be watching a game show. Even in English this movie sucked on the terms that it was filled with a bunch of characters that shouldn't have been there. The movie itself started out as a flick about getting a chance to be in a movie then stumbled miserably into a cheap kidnapping/brawl to the death flick. What made it so bad was the fact that as the movie went on it kept introducing characters that no one had seen before. Also there were some surprises that weren't much of a shock. It would be better to rent this but don't buy it unless you're using it as a distraction to create a quick exit out of a room!",1320624000,,1106,4.426470588235294
4526129,5,B0051T47HC,"Thai Martial Arts films either tend to be weak on plot or too plot/theme-centric to be completely enjoyable (Ong Bak 3). The best of them tend to view their plots as merely incidental: getting Hero A to Position B to fight Villain C. This is one of those films... to the extreme. If you want your martial arts movies with a strong plot and emotional resonance (Really?), then you should look elsewhere. What you will find here is a wacky, intense, jaw-dropping spectacle where martial artists fight a giant, ax-swinging, flaming psychopath that could be Jason Voorhees' Thai cousin, a lunatic in a car, an asthmatic sadist, and probably the most insane ""under a tractor trailer"" fight you'll ever see. You'll finish watching this movie wondering how nobody DIED while making this film. And really, what more encouragement do you need than that?",1318723200,16,844,4.909090909090909
4526130,2,B0051T47HC,"Most martial arts and action films share one thing in common; the action scenes are usually pretty well developed while everything else is either weak in comparison or just flat out poor in quality. This is especially relevant when it comes to foreign action films. One could make the argument that you don't go into a film like this for Oscar-worthy performances or a thought provoking story and that is true, but when you come to the realization that your dog that spends all day chewing on its groin probably could've written a better story or when you've seen better acting come out of that geriatric man plagued with tremors when he greets you during one of your shameful trips to Wal-Mart then it becomes a bit of an issue. That is actually a great way to describe BKO: Bangkok Knockout; a shameful experience that's about as entertaining as chewing on your groin.

The story is pretty atrocious. It's almost on the verge on pain inducing. It's that bad. Two fight groups square off for a chance to go to Hollywood and make it big. If ""So You Think You Can Dance"" was actually ""So You Think You Know Martial Arts"" then that is exactly what we'd have here. The team you're expecting to win does and they go off to celebrate, but oh no! They're drugged and wake up the following morning in a strange place without their cars or cell phones. It turns out that this is what they were competing for. This is the show they were so desperate to be a part of. It's like The Running Man filled with two dozen people who can't act, but can fight like CRAZY. Now our winning team, team Fight Club, are just trying to survive the endless supply of fights, challenges, and mostly just struggle to survive this hell they've been tricked into participating in.

BKO tries to throw a few twists in near the end of the movie, but it's nothing you can't see coming a mile away. Not only that, but it's done to death. Oh, did you not like that the first time? Here's the same twist two more times to make it really redundant. The last one involves a character you don't even care about. There's this character in the movie who's a wedding singer and is basically a Thai version of Pat from ""Saturday Night Live."" Is it male? Is it female? You won't care. You'll just want to see this THING have its face shoved through the hood of a car. Then there's this fight scene that involves a man in drag who's also addicted to pain that is just incredibly peculiar. It's as if they were aiming for it to be entertaining, but it came off as if it was directed by Buffalo Bill. That may sound intriguing at first, but once you get that lotion in that basket and he tucks it in then it's mostly just sad.

The acting is about as pleasant as nails on a chalkboard. Even when everyone acts and talks in their native language, every scene is littered with overacting. Then to make matters worse those scenes are dragged out so the torture lasts even longer. But then they decide to throw a bunch of English dialogue in there spoken by people who can barely speak it. It's all just very underwhelming and its ridiculous charm runs thin extremely fast.

BKO does deliver some entertaining fight scenes, but it feels like an eternity before we ever actually get to that. A few exciting things are teased, but nothing really fully gets underway for about forty minutes. We have too much of the lame story to experience in the mean time. But it becomes very clear that not everyone in the cast is as skilled of a fighter as some of the others. The two women who try to keep up with the men are pretty bad in comparison, especially the actress who plays Joy. Her fight scenes are sloppy, slow, and/or very obviously sped up to try and keep up with the pace of the rest of the film. However most of the fight scenes are worth seeing. The cage fight is easily the highlight of the film while Lerm's fight with the man in the iron mask is pretty incredible, as well. There's a fight involving water, an axe wielding man who gets lit on fire only to continue fighting., and a Mad Max inspired car that has about a dozen people get shoved through it in all of the crazy mayhem.

If you loved Ong Bak, then this may be worth looking into for the rather jaw-dropping action sequences. Otherwise you probably won't really enjoy it too much. The story is terrible, the acting is worse, and the dialogue just makes you wish you could knock yourself out from experiencing it any further. Then to top it off the women can't act or fight and there's this really annoying man-girl that gets on your last nerve. BKO: Bangkok Knockout does have some good buried deep within its layers of nearly unbearable inadequacies, but does the rubbish it shovels down your throat in the meantime make the entire journey worthwhile? You'll have to be the judge of that.

Special features are pretty slim. There's a Making of BKO: Bangkok Knockout featurette that's about fourteen minutes long. It's mostly just a good portion of the cast talking about how things came together for them to be part of the movie. Things discussed in the feature include the meaning of the title, diversity of fighting styles, the movie taking two years to develop, this being the first action movie for Spuksorn Chaimongkol (Joy), Kerttisak Udomnak (Wanchai) doing his own stunts, Pimchanok Leuwisedpaiboon (Fern) discussing action scenes, Chachapol Kulsiriwoottichai (Pod) telling the story of how he seeked out the part, Tanarit Wongsuwan (Pom) talks about incorporated all of his training into one fighting style, Sarawoot Kumsorn's (U-Go) water fight being unrelenting, and Puchong Sartnork (Eddo) participating in free running and using that as part of his fighting style among many other things. A Behind the Scenes featurette is a little over ten minutes in length and is mostly an in-depth look at many of the big fight scenes in the movie while they're being filmed. The cage fight, the fall, Joy being tied up, the pole fight, Pod and Joy's fight with the ninja, the rumble scene near the end featuring everybody, and the man catching on fire are all in there. What's interesting to notice is that all the fights look to be real. Every punch, every kick, every fall taken was actually taken by the actors. Injuries seem to be minimal and usually just involve somebody taking a kick improperly or their finger bleeding. Lastly, a one and a half minute trailer rounds out the twenty seven minutes or so of special features.

BKO: Bangkok Knockout is rated R for violence and strong martial arts action and some language. It's available in languages English and Thai with English or Spanish Titles, is available in 5.1 Dolby Digital sound, and presented in widescreen with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1. It is approximately 106 minutes long and should be available in both retail stores and most online retailers now.",1314748800,6,6840,4.5924713584288055
4526131,5,B0051T47HC,I saw a screening of this film at Otakon 2011. Just a great Thai action flick in the tradition of Ong Bak & Born to Fight. The stunts and action set pieces will have you jumping for joy. This flick puts every western action movie made in the last 20 years to shame. I am very much looking forward to what the Thai action film makers come up with next.,1313107200,11,351,4.0285714285714285

doesn't get much better than this. Its a fight tournament style movie

Muay Thai action is similar to Ong Bak, but there is way more actual
fighting than Ong Bak, and it is more brutal with a darker feel.
Production values are excellent, and there aren't much special effects

4526136,5,B0051T47HC,"This is another Thai martial arts film. Thailand has really taken up the slack in recent years while Hong Kong has fallen to making a lot more retreads.

Bangkok Knockout has a style all it's own and really takes the action to another level. I won't bore you with the plot details, as with any martial arts film the plot is just an excuse to make more action and this movie does not disappoint.

Specific to this version: This is the Asian imported edition. Uncut and uncensored in the original audio language with English subtitles. That's the way martial arts movies should be watched.

The US release has some cheesy dub voice, they can really pull you out of the movie, plus the US version usually costs more.",1310774400,,713,4.5546875
4526147,5,B0051T47HC,"I've always felt that an action movie that pays a lot of attention to storyline and detailed subplots can actually make the action more effective, and I still do.  But BKO: Bangkok Knockout (original title - Khotr Su Khotr So) is a reminder that sometimes, it can really be cool to just go with a simpler plot structure, a basic establishment of a few characters to root for and a few to root against, and just let the action start flying.

Basically, the story is this: a group of teams formed from MMA clubs and so on have been competing in non-lethal, friendly (for the most part) challenges in order to get a contract to be the stunt team on a big Hollywood movie.  Once the rounds and done and one team is the winner, they're at a celebratory dinner when it suddenly becomes clear that the people sponsoring the tournament have something quite different in mind.  They're not producing a movie at all but a real-life fight-to-the-death scenario in a vacant building for the enjoyment and betting of a few extremely rich clients.  With the building surrounded and a warning that they'll be gunned down if they try to escape, the organization also abducts one of their friends, Joy, (played by the GORGEOUS Supaksorn Chaimongkol), who I gather is a recent sign-up to the club because she's not part of the group who thought they were heading out to make a movie, and hold her for ransom.  Adding even more incentive one of the club members later learns that his mother and little brother have been taken prisoner as well.  The group now has to fight their way out of a building loaded with video cameras recording their every move and broadcasting to the organization's clients, defeat the various adversaries sent their way, clear the building and try to rescue the hostages.

And what a 'fight their way out of the building' it is!  This movie features some of the most spectacular hand-to-hand combat sequences ever put on film.  These are incredible even by the standards of Asian martial arts showcases.  Are they ultra-realistic in every way?  No, not really, and they're not really supposed to be.  Are they incredibly dynamic shows of skill, athleticism and fight choreography that'll have the viewer flinching back from the screen as kicks and elbows and lead pipes sail through the air?  Yes, that's what they're going for and that's what you get.  You've got likable protagonists, interesting villains and a couple of kind of 'in-between' characters.  The  production values, which sometimes suffer in Thai movies from low budgets, are in this one handled very well.  And if you've ever thought about how cool it would be if a movie took one of the Asian action phenoms and put him up against a masked, practically indestructable, Jason Voorhees/Leatherface-type character, it's right here.

All in all, a thrilling and highly memorable action extravaganza, and essential viewing for anyone even vaguely interested in Asian action movies.",1419033600,2,2952,4.8562874251497

4526153,3,B0051T47HC,"Let me introduce myself as the martial-arts-movie-fan that didn't like the Thai-film ""Chocolate"" (2008).  Yep, that's me.  I also thought that while ""Born to Fight"" (2004) had some exciting stunts, it was mostly boring and poorly handled.  However, of the other Thai-flicks I've seen, I was quite fond of ""Ong Bak"" (2003), ""Raging Phoenix"" (2009),""Dynamite Warrior"" (2006) and I LOVED ""The Protector"" (2005).  I am happy to report that this film belongs in the category of the latter.  Oh, it's dumb and, as I've mentioned in my reviews of some of the aforementioned titles, I have absolutely no problem with dumb... but there IS an art to it.

Several small groups of martial artists enter a stunt-competition for a chance to go to Hollywood for Dr. Duschanon (Kazu Patrick Tang, the bewhiskered protagonist from ""Raging Phoenix""), who masks his real intention of selecting them to fight for the gambling amusement of the Eurocentric Mr. Snead (Speedy Arnold).  Our group of heroes, known as Fight Club, wins the competition and after celebrating, wake-up stranded with headaches, little memory of the previous night, and no vehicles or cell phones.  They should've known it was a put-on!  What the hell would Hollywood want with real martial artists and stuntpeople?  They'd just be slowed down so that they could be bested by the likes of Shia LaBeouf and, God forbid, Nicolas Cage.

In order to motivate the team to fight, female member Joy (Supakson Chairmongkol) is abducted, as she happens to be the mutual love interest of the teams' two top practitioners, leader Pod (Chatchapol Kulsiriwoottichai) and capable Pom (Tanavit Wongsuwan).  As they set out to find her, they are attacked by (mostly) masked opponents and seemingly impossible odds.  Odds that no one on earth would gamble on except for the small handful of super-rich morons that Mr. Snead has gathered, who view the results from the back of a furnished semi-trailer!  So that's what elite members of oligarchies do in their spare time! I knew it!

Yes, this is a silly movie and, apart from the plot, does have an intentional sense of humor.  The flick takes a lot of simple elements from many American films, such as ""Saw"" (or ""Cube"" or ""Predators""), ""King of the Kickboxers"", ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Death Race"" and ""Friday the 13th"".  Considering that the little boy's name is revealed to be Ping, I guess I'd have to consider ""Lethal Weapon IV"", as well.

The fights are inconsistent but incorporate a variety of styles and when they're on, WOW!  Just past the 30 minute mark, there's a fight inside of a fenced cage that's as well-done and creative as any I've ever seen, immediately followed by a teriffic one-on-one.  A large portion of the finale is marred by slow-motion but even in lesser action scenes there are usually scattered moments of cringe-inducing gasps, except for director Panna Rittikrai's (""The Bodyguard"") celebrated but painfully slow brawl.  Other than that, the film's only real enemies are a couple of annoying characters (none of which are as bad as I've had to put up with in old-school kung fu) and stupidity.

The DVD from Magnet/Magnolia boasts the excellent widescreen picture-quality I've come to expect from their releases, though I still view from the obsolescence of an old-school television, so, what do I know?  Special features include a ""making of"" and a ""behind the scenes"" that are brief but cool. Spoken languages include Thai & English with subtitles in English & Spanish.  If you truly enjoy fights and stunts this needs to be seen, especially if you don't mind when logic hits the ""eject"" button.  Recommended.  Whether or not it's highly so depends on individual tastes.  3.5/5

4526154,4,B0051T47HC,"In tuning in to BKO: BANGKOK KNOCKOUT, you'll run into an exhausted premise and endure extended spells of dubious acting and cliched dialogue. And yet you ought to stick around. Because the action sequences, when they finally surface, are damn spiffy. The filmmakers had a flashbulb ignite overhead: ""Hey, since we don't have Tony Jaa,"" they reasoned, ""why not get a a bunch of Tony Jaa types?"" I don't know any of these nine cats showcased here, and their acting may fall in the not-trying-all-that-hard category. But their martial arts chops are strong, brother. To differentiate between them, it helps that each character specializes in a different fighting discipline. But, no, I won't even try to drop the actors' names. Watching the film, I pretty much referred to them as ""the black-clad capoeira dude"" or ""the slick Chinese boxer"" or ""the beefy Muay Thai guy."" And then there are those two chicks who sometimes can fight capably but then are sometimes relegated to the roles of hapless damsels-in-distress.

The story takes its sweet time getting to the meat of things. In Thailand, fifty contending martial arts teams vie for the chance to work in Hollywood, except that, now, the contestants have been narrowed down to two competing clubs: the ""Stunt for Life"" and the ""Fight Club."" What they don't know is that there's no Hollywood gig. Instead, the winning team is drugged and forced to engage in an underground death match against a army of martial arts goons. The bouts are staged in a sprawling warehouse, with the action captured by strategically situated cameras. As an incentive, one of the team's womenfolk is abducted and, throughout the film, is dragged around the warehouse to draw in her would-be rescuers. Of course, there's the evil American behind it all. Of course, we can't do without the exclusive club/trailer hosting a select group of wealthy, ethnic stereotype gamblers, all champing at the bit to place their death wagers. This is a standard plot of the kung fu flick. I'll say this: once the plot is established and thirty minutes deep, the pace picks up to a fever pitch. But that's probably a kinder way of saying that this sucker doesn't have much in the way of story development.

BKO: BANGKOK KNOCKOUT is co-directed by Panna Rittikrai who directed BORN TO FIGHT and who was the stunt coordinator for ONG-BAK and CHOCOLATE. Given that he was a star of Thai action cinema of the '70s and '80s, it's not too weird that Panna would get back in front of the camera. He plays the quietly imposing big bad who stands pat for most of the film. But we all get an inkling that should this grizzled old master spring into action, the good guys are in for a painful shellacking. Too bad they saddled Panna's character with asthma.

Once it gets going, the action doesn't relent. This is a ridiculously talented bunch of young martial artists/stunt men turned actors. The moves they execute are wicked, eye-widening stuff. The wild, hurtful stunts would make Jackie Chan yearn for his youth. Maybe my favorite action set piece showcases the mad gymnastics performed by cage match antagonists (one of 'em a parkour specialist) who brawl all over the surface of chain-linked fences. There's also an alarming scrap that takes place under a moving truck. The film's third act also features a massive, hectic free-for-all as our tired and battered protagonists face attackers erupting out of the woodwork. Sometime after, Panna Rittikrai finally gets into the act and demonstrates that he still has the skills and swagger to take out an entire fight club and make it look effortless. Listen, go check out BKO: BANGKOK KNOCKOUT. It's worth wading thru the lame stuff to get to the insane fighty fights. The quality of these fights earns the film 3.5 out of 5 stars. There's also the added thrill of watching various fighting techniques pitted against each other.

The DVD's bonus stuff:

4526155,3,B0051T47HC,"There was a time when Chinese martial arts films ruled. It was from these films that others took interest in martial arts and brought them into US and European films. The Japanese brought excelled at Samurai films and those too were given a western flair. But both of these oriental disciplines are falling in decline when it comes to martial arts action by the country of Thailand and its rising star Tony Jaa. And Panna Rittikrai, who directed Jaa in two of the ONG BAK films, has assembled a cast of martial arts stars for his newest film BK: BANGKOK KNOCKOUT.

Critics of the film are quick to jump on the fact that the film has the smallest of plots and that the acting is atrocious. Since I don't speak Thai I would say that I can't condemn the acting. Face it; there is much that is lost in translation. As for the plot, sure it's rather simple but many martial arts fans are seeking action as opposed to story and they won't be disappointed here.

So the simple story is this: a teacher has assembled groups of martial arts schools into a contest. The winner has the chance for the entire team to be taken to Hollywood to star in his next big production. We, the viewers, know that something isn't right from the get go. A cigar smoking bad guy named Mr. Snead keeps pushing the teacher to get things going and if he isn't involved in something illegal then you haven't noticed many bad guys in movies.

A team is selected and goes out that night to celebrate. They get a little bit rowdy and a little bit drunk and almost find themselves in a fight with the caterer and his crew. But things settle and they enjoy the rest of their night. The problem is when they wake in the morning they discover they've been drugged and taken somewhere.

The setting seems like an abandoned set of buildings, mostly factories. The group wanders a bit until they're attacked by someone driving a heavily enforced car. Herded to a special building, they find the ""teacher"" waiting for them. Standing by him is the caterer. The teacher informs them that they are now part of his production, a fight between two opposing forces. The caterer is an expert martial arts fighter whose team will take on this group to see who is best. To make sure they perform, he kidnaps one of the girls from the team, a love interests between two of their best fighters.

Back to Mr. Snead. From a luxuriously outfitted trailer, Mr. Snead is hosting a party of extremely wealthy gamblers who will bet on the outcome of the fights they will witness. The stakes are high and eventually they move from simple fights to battles to the death, all the while betting on who will win.

So there's the set up. The plot. Incredibly simple and yet before the movie ends we discover a traitor in the midst of the good guys and a more dangerous combatant than we expected from the bad.

But it's not the story here. And there is no way to describe the fight sequences in detail. But they are there and there are tons of them, everything from a Jason Voorhees killer with an axe to a cross dresser who's more deadly than you'd expect. The fights are non-stop action and the sort that leaves you amazed at the stamina of the combatants to be able to run and fight like this for nearly 2 hours.  Then again, it's only a movie. But an action packed one at that.

No break out stars are seen here and director Rittikrai states in the extras that what he wanted to do was make a spectacular action film that would feature not one but a number of martial arts stars to be together in one film. He accomplishes what he set out to do here with each member having their own special scenes throughout.

If you're looking for a movie with just action, little plot and enough great stunt work to hold your interest then you won't find many movies that will foot the bill like this one. It's unrelenting action from start to finish and might possibly result in being the first exposure to one or two more Tony Jaa like stars.",1332201600,,3970,4.41120218579235

8453264,5,B0051T47HC,"This is concrete proof that it isn't necessary to have sequels for one off films that are this great. This movie by far is one of the absolute best of it's kind by any generation's standards. Tony & Jeeja are the best male & female solo performers of their generation. That being the case this group of up & coming stars definitely out performs any team deemed as a worthy comparison. They're not household names yet like the two solo acts previously mentioned, but hopefully if they all keep working together they could be the next ""Venom Mob"".",1438560000,,545,4.571428571428571

8453266,4,B0051T47HC,This was just a really fun action with a bit of twist to the story. Think SAW if you will but instead of deadly traps the people must fight each other in some underground sport for the super rich to bet on. The basic plot is some martial artist were tricked into thinking they won a competition that will take them to Hollywood but are really kidnapped & forced to fight others in various pre selected conditions. The plot is good enough to hold your attention & by the end you will be rooting for the heroes. There are also several twist in the story that I won't spoil but I thought were kinda well done. The fights is where this film really shines they are both great & exciting to watch. Some are also very creative & use the environment very well. Id highly recommend this film to action & martial arts fans.,1426204800,,813,4.285714285714286
