3827245,5,B001XCWNOA,"Please see my review of Season 1. Season 2 is a continuation of the first season, and yes, it is even better. Felicia Day who wrote both seasons' episodes and is also its star, finally received corporate backing, so now it's on firm financial footing, and a Season 3 is in the works.

Season 2 takes off where Season 1 ended with the conflicts of The Guild (an online gaming group), which were cause by the guild meeting in the real world, waging on. Codex's troubled personal life gets more and more complicated. The ending of Season 2 is a real shocker that has a mythical quality you won't want to miss.",1242691200,,606,4.410714285714286
3827246,5,B001XCWNOA,"I wrote in my first review of Season 1 of The Guild how charming and spectacular the show is; not to mention, how shocking it is that the show has come so far as to be released on DVD.  Everything about the first season can be repeated here, kind of negating a need for a review.

Season 2 begins pretty much right where Season 1 ends.  Codex talks to her webcam, summarizing the events that happened after the first Season.  The story that follows deals mostly with a server outage for their game, forcing the members of the Knights of Good to deal with the real world.  What makes the second season so much better than the already excellent first is that, now that we've been introduced to the characters, they can be given room to grow.  Much more character development is given in this season and the show allows each character to have their individual storylines and key moments, splitting screen time a bit more evenly.  The witty writing and the hilarious situations that arise are still here, except I found this season even more humorous than the first.

The story climaxes at a hilarious party that leaves on a bittersweet cliffhanger of an ending.  So it's a good thing that Season Three is just around the corner.  If you haven't given The Guild a chance, go out and watch it now.  It's hilarious, witty and a perfect celebration of MMO geek lifestyle, but it can also be appreciated by people who have no knowledge of the lifestyle.  It's the rare beast that can cater to both the culture and those not in it.",1241654400,10,1522,4.494545454545454
3827247,5,B001XCWNOA,"Television is going the way of the dinosaur and the Guild is the first of many scripted series on the Internet and is definitely the most popular.  Buy the DVD, watch it on line ([...]) or download it on xbox 360.  You will not regret it.",1240704000,,238,4.1521739130434785
3827248,5,B001XCWNOA,"I've spent 10 years working in the game industry and a good chunk of that time was for G4TV. When I first saw The Guild I realized that it was exactly the type of programming that a videogame-centric network needed. It understands its audience, it's genuinely funny, the characters are fun and lively, and I dare any geek not to fall in love with Felecia day's Codex. Season Two sees this show get the funding it deserves and the team behind it proves that they know what they're doing on everything from a production standpoint to the story. Funny, heartwarming, charming, and geeky, it's everything a geek like me would want.",1240617600,14,627,4.657657657657658
3827249,5,B001XCWNOA,"The original season of The Guild, which took online gamers by storm on YouTube, poked gentle fun at its target audience. But any mouse-clicking geek watching could tell that producer/writer/star Felicia Day was one of them. The game references, the acronyms and slag, and even the archetypes of each member of The Guild are instantly familiar--but fortunately the show expanded on the archetypes to create characters that offered real humor and a few surprises.

Season Two does everything the first season did, only better. Codex -- the character name an Ultima reference if you're an 80s computer gamer like me -- still delivers her webcam opening monologues; Zaboo still tactlessly pursues an unwelcome relationship; Vork still lives only for the game, tracking each penny of his expenses to maintain his frighteningly cheap lifestyle. But we learn a bit more about each character this time, as the story builds from what we saw in the first season and actually includes several threaded subplots as well. The primary focus is on love and lust, with a dose of betrayal and revenge for good measure. To Felicia Day's credit she's willing to evolve the characters' relationships and shake up the status quo by the end of the story.

The production value is far higher than in the first season. While some fans complain they miss home-spun feel of the YouTube videos, I thought it was great to see production quality matching network television sitcoms. There are more locations revealed, the most fun definitely being Vork's scary home in a bad part of town. I watched the season in HD Video on my X-Box with a nice sound system, and the show looked and sounded great.

In short, anyone who enjoyed the The Guild is in its first run will find lots to love in Season Two. The characters, relationships, and humor from the original is all there--with a larger world with additional people for the Guildies to play off of. With a great price, bonus features, and the knowledge you're supporting the future of the show a DVD purchase would seem to be a no-brainer!",1240444800,39,2061,4.849431818181818
3827250,5,B001XCWNOA,"I've loved this web series since its debut and the DVDs have been pretty great.  It's weird that they are DVD Rs, but no big deal.  They work in our DVD player and PS3 so no worries.",1265155200,,182,3.891891891891892
3827251,5,B001XCWNOA,Absolutely Fun-tastic!  I've never seen such bold originality anywhere on the boob-tube.  Hilarious to watch and I believe that families with WOW addicts might use this series as intervention material.  My hat's off to Felicia Day for taking the courage to make this project a reality.  I look forward to future projects Felicia Day churns out.  May the series live long and prosper!  Sub-Scribed!!,1260316800,,398,5.140625
3827252,5,B001XCWNOA,I bought this at the same time and watched it in the same evening as season one -- this was as good if not better than the first season.  While keeping true to the comedy that made me enjoy the first season (gamers will just get it when they watch it) they actually did a great job developing the characters further.  The end of the season was both epically hilarious and left you hanging (and craving) for season three.,1253404800,,420,4.30379746835443
3827253,5,B001XCWNOA,"I'm serious! Don't get this. Instead, get the new disc that collects all the content of Season One and Season Two. It is cheaper and more convenient. While I dearly love this show, there is not a lot of content. It would be much nicer to have all the content on one disc than having to switch from one disc to another.

THE GUILD is one of the most successful direct-to-Internet series yet produced. It was created and is written by and stars Felecia Day, who starred, along with Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion, in what is by far the most successful Internet-first project ever, DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG. The series concerns a group of people who would normally have nothing to do with one another, but have been drawn together by playing World of Warcraft together. For though who have never played WoW (I suppose such individuals exist), one of the things that you can do in WoW is form guilds who quest together. From personal experience I can attest that you end up forming online friendships with people you normally would not spend much time with. If you have played WoW, the show has lots of subtleties that will seem familiar and fun. I've intentionally avoided meeting anyone that I play online with, but these poor souls decide to meet in person. (Though I never join guilds for person reasons. I detest PvP [Player versus Player] and WoW is structured so that if one member of a guild fights a member of another guild, all members of each guild are thereby opposed to one another. Since I could not find a way to be a member of a guild and not PvP, I played solo, which luckily isn't that hard to do in WoW. BTW, I stopped playing WoW after maxing out several characters because of the staggering amount of time that gaming can absorb. Never going to get that book written playing WoW.)

The Guild consists of: Codex (her online name), played by Felecia Day; Zaboo, a Hinjew (half Indian/half Jewish) who stalks Codex; Vork, an early middle-aged loser who lives in his dead grandfather's house (he lives off cashing his granddad's social security checks, and who is also a world-class tightwad and the titular head of the guild); Clara, the mother of three toddlers that she neglects to play online; Tinkerballa, a cute Asian girl who is so obsessed with gaming that she plays Gameboy while also playing WoW; and Bladezz, a long-haired teen who is not the most popular character on the show in Season One. This exceedingly odd collection of individuals unhappily linked with one another provides a host of funny moments that shouldn't be missed.

Felecia Day has pretty much established herself as the hottest female actress on the Internet. Though many knew her from her Season Seven appearance on BUFFY as one of the Potentials, most of her work has been away from either film or television. DR. HORRIBLE made her on online star, a status that was quickly reinforced by the beginning of THE GUILD. She also starred in the great, though unaired episode of DOLLHOUSE ""Epitaph One,"" which many regard as the best episode of DOLLHOUSE. But again, unless you watch it on DVD, you won't see it at all. Most recently she has become even more popular due to a music video based on THE GUILD ""going viral."" If you haven't seen ""Would You Like to Date My Avatar?"" do so immediately. Starring Day and the rest of the cast of THE GUILD, with music written by Jed Whedon (the brother of Joss), it is a delightful send up of online socializing. The song is infectious, the performances delightful, and the lyrics witty. And it completes the whole DR. HORRIBLE-""Epitaph One,"" and music video trilogy. Jed Whedon co-wrote DR. HORRIBLE and ""Epitaph One"" with his wife Maurissa Tancharoen, and Maurissa is one of the performing dancers in the music video (she is one of the female dancers who back up Tinkerballa). And Felecia Day starred in all three. She is so adorable that I'd love to see her translate her online and DVD success to film and TV. Until then, we have this delightful online series. Do yourself a favor and get not this DVD, but the new one that collects both Season One and Two.",1253318400,,4106,4.637362637362638
3827254,5,B001XCWNOA,"Once again, Felicia and friends deliver great entertainment for geeks and n00bs alike. The budget has noticeably increased from Season One but it has not dumbed down any of the inside jokes and quick banter. Guests for this season were a good fit and well played and returning cast had expanded backstory for their characters.

Great fun and worthy of repeated viewings.

Thank you, Felicia.",1253232000,,391,5.0
3827255,4,B001XCWNOA,"Excellent DVD!  The interviews, extra footage keeps me hooked on this show!  Great job guys!",1252800000,,92,5.066666666666666
3827256,5,B001XCWNOA,"The second season of a brilliant show and it doesn't disappoint. A great show well worth the money, I just wish the episodes would come out quicker as the long waits leave you hungry for more.",1252540800,,192,4.361111111111111
3827257,5,B001XCWNOA,"The second season of ""The Guild"" picks up shortly after the events covered in season 1 and it is still one of the cleverest series I have ever seen. This season has 12 episodes (there were 10 episodes in season one) and they retain the same basic format where each one opens with Cyd setting the stage talking to us on her webcam. The episodes are fairly short, but they are packed full of good acting and humor that almost anyone who spends time on-line will be able to relate to. Felicia Day is great as Cyd Sherman (an ""On-Line Game Addict"") and her alter ego ""Codex"" (cleric/healer) who mixes her real life with her on-line life. Her problems and the individual neuroses of the other characters (both live and game characters) are explored in greater detail, often with actual laugh out loud results.

This is a very good series and the DVD is reasonably priced. While the entire series can be found on-line, I bought the DVD to support the show.

It should be noted that there is a good bit of adult content and innuendo that makes this in appropriate for younger audiences.

Highly Recommended!",1248825600,,1100,4.573604060913706
3827258,5,B001XCWNOA,"The Guild is a comedic gem lovingly directed at and about geeks and gamers, but the cast is so great together and Felicia Day (Codex) is so charming and lovely that this show would be hard for anybody NOT to love. Filled with in-jokes and geeky subtext, every episode is an absolute riot to watch over and over again. The second season is every bit as clever and hilarious as the first but with even better production values.",1247616000,,425,4.461538461538462
3827259,5,B001XCWNOA,"Is there anything Felicia can't do?  I haven't seen her try bull riding or playing baseball - maybe one of those is her Achilles' Heel.  When it comes to writing a web-series she created, acting in that web-series, singing in someone else's web series (Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog) or acting on a regular tv show (Dollhouse episode #13), she doesn't seem to have any peers.  The Guild is laugh-a-minute hilarity about a group of online gamers who have had the misfortune of meeting each other in real life.  It's mostly about Felicia's character, Codex (who does a preamble vlog to begin each episode), but it's also about the other five members of the Knights of Good guild - a more flawed group of people you've never met.  Of course, it's their many flaws that make them so incredibly interesting and funny.  The main storyline revolves around Codex's attempts at either having or avoiding a love life.  The other characters have their own problems that they are trying to cope with.  That these six completely different personalities all wound up in the same guild makes for insane interactions between them as their expectations of each other are often way off the mark (Yes, Bladezz and Tink, I'm especially thinking of you two.)  I won't go into specific storylines, as that would give away too much.  Just go ahead and buy it - you'll enjoy it.  Oh, I forgot to mention the killer extras - the commentaries and other extras aren't online and they make the dvd worth buying all by themselves.  I definitely recommend this one very highly.",1246147200,,1548,4.7565543071161045
3827260,5,B001XCWNOA,"This is a no-brainer.  The Guild is a wonder web series that revolves around the lives of a group of on-line gamers.  What makes this series so wonderful is that it is clear that it is written by someone who is 'writing what she knows.'

The true delight in the show comes from the group dynamic.  Ms. Day has taken the players that she has played with and has somehow boiled them down to 5 personalities, the likes of which everyone runs across in the gaming realm.

The real treat on this DVD is the extras.  There are quite a few.  Two excellent commentary tracks, gag reels, and...well, I don't want to ruin it all but I also found an Easter Egg (hilarious).

It is funny because even though you can watch all these episodes for free online or via Xbox Live, I would still recommend that you pick up this DVD.  It is a must have.  The way the series Spaced captured a very specific time period of pop culture, The Guild captures the present period.  Kudos to all who worked on this and made it possible.",1242691200,,1007,4.303191489361702
3827261,5,B001XCWNOA,"Felicia Day plays the part of Syd Sherman, who begins each webisode with an entry to her video blog, and the remaining 4 minutes (+/-) depict her struggles to lead the normal life that any shy, too-nice-for-her-own-good, child-prodigy, gamer-girl would like to lead.

This is a good series about how the lives of Syd and her five guild mates' lives become more entwined with each webisode.  Like any good comedy, there are running gags, and quirky routines that flow throughout that make the series so much more enjoyable as a whole, than a single webisode viewed here and there.

As a geek and part time gamer, I've met some people like these characters online in the MMORPG that I play, and find the enactment of guildee interaction and guild drama classically hilarious!  I believe everyone will embrace ""The Guild"" and its cast as everyone has embraced those on ""Big Bang Theory"" (CBS - Mondays).",1242691200,,900,4.824675324675325
3827262,5,B001XCWNOA,"By far one of the best creations on the web.  The Guild is what tv creators used to aspire to be: original and entertaining.

3827263,5,B001XCWNOA,"The Guild Season 2 continues to follow our favorite Guildies in thei misadventures.  Everything you liked about Season One, but more so.  It's funnier, more touching, looks amazing and I think if you say it's name backwards it may grant you magical powers.  In all seriousness, The Guild is a wakeup call for the Hollywood Studio System.  Web content from ""amateurs"" is smarter and funnier than any sitcom that's made it through the Hollywood meatgrinder in years.  The Guild's talented staff are fulfilling the promise of new media, one episode at a time.  Watch your back, networks!",1242691200,,584,4.969072164948454
3827264,5,B001XCWNOA,"Despite my review title, I wasn't surprised at all when I saw how awesome The Guild Season 2 is. I had watched Season 1 soon after it ended and I've been following the Guildies since then. Waited a few months (but it felt like long long months) to Season two and I had VERY high expectations. Well, it was even better than I expected.

Season two upped the game. The video quality is beautiful, so colourful and shiny! Episodes are longer, which means more awesomeness per episode. The cast grew and we had the addition of the gorgeous and lovely Michele Boyd (Riley), the super cool Fernando Chien (Wade), and the also cool Brett Sheridan (George). Plus, the most awesome extras ever.

The main characters are even funnier than in Season 1, the story arcs were great and it all ended up in an amazing and surprising season finale.

I haven't actually got the dvd yet (long way from the US to Brazil, but I'm patiently wait to get it on my mail box), but from the little extra content we've seen online, I'm absolutely sure the dvd extras will be awesome as well.

Buying this dvd means you have on your home the dvd of the best web-series ever (and let's face it, even one of the best series - between web and tv - that is out there nowadays) and means that you are supporting the SUPER AWESOME cast and crew that work so hard to do this.

As a fan of many things, I have to say that being a Guild fan is one of the best fan experiences I've ever (and probably will have) have.

So huge thanks and congratz to this brilliant cast and crew!

3827265,5,B001XCWNOA,"If we lived in an age that appreciated screwball comedies, Felicia Day would be a big movie star--she's hilarious both in her own right and reacting to the even crazier characters who populate The Guild. In Season 2 of this terrific show (first shown on the web), she has once again created a slew of painfully funny situations and given her talented cast terrific material. But there's also real humanity here, as the characters struggle to figure out how to live in the perilous world that exists outside their computer screens.

I love this show, and I think a ton of other people will too.",1242691200,,593,4.647619047619048
3827266,5,B001XCWNOA,"I put off checking out ""The Guild"" for months because I assumed it would go over my head, not being a gamer. I was wrong. It's hilarious. And it can appeal to a broad audience. I even got my 67 year old dad hooked! Most DVD reviews review the series instead of reviewing the DVD itself. Suffice it to say the series is excellent but I won't go further into that.

The DVD package is impressively well-done given the budget constraints an indie production like this has. There are brief cast interviews. However, what's unique is brief interviews of the crew and extras as well. Our starstruck culture conveniently forgets that film is a collaborative medium. While we see the people on camera, there are loads of folks off-camera who contribute as well. It was interesting to get to know what some of their jobs are as well as seeing the way The Guild's quality material has attracted passionate fans that are willing to pitch in to help the series succeed (whether as extras, crew, donors, etc.).

There are gag reels, the script, audition footage, the Ep 1 table read, & fan art. The Ep 1 table read and audition footage gives you insight into how lines are re-written even up to the moment of filming and how line reads change as the actors become more familiar with things. From the beginning, The Guild has tried to be accessible to an international audience. With the help of fans, they've provided subtitles in several languages. There's also a cast commentary and creator/director/producer commentary. Though you can watch the series free on MSN Video (if you don't mind prostituting your eyeballs and putting up with the annoying interface), they've given you enough extras to persuade you to pony up for the DVD. And, really, the DVD is offered at a very reasonable price.",1242691200,4,1782,4.726688102893891

8347633,5,B001XCWNOA,"Zaboo's mother has been defeated, but the battles for the Knights of Good are not over. ""The Guild - Season Two"" throws a bunch of new problems at our favorite gang of gaming nerds -- the woes of romancing a neighbor, guys engaging in guy time, and the devastating threat of server down time! It's even funnier than the first season.

Codex and Zaboo move into a new apartment, since Zaboo's mom got her evicted from her old one. But her apartment comes with a bonus: a sexy stuntman that Codex desperately wants to impress. At the same time, she manages to unload Zaboo on Vork as his new roommate, despite the fact that Vork is completely insane (his house looks like a ""before"" picture from ""Hoarders"").

Meanwhile, Tinkerballa (Amy Okuda) uses her feminine charms to get stuff from Bladezz, and Clara gets POed at Vork after she fails to get a cosmetic orb. Then the Guild is hit by a terrifying threat: four hours of server downtime! How will they cope with four hours of the real world? One word: PARTY. Several words: wild party that will involve fighting, kissing and betrayal.

""The Guild - Season Two"" is actually even more fun than the first season. It has the same basic story -- personal conflict within the Guild -- but the writers mix it up with some wildly different subplots. The biggest one would be Codex awkwardly trying to have a ""normal"" romance, especially considering how neurotic she is at the best of times.

The rest of the time, we're bounced between a trio of lesser subplots that are there just long enough to be hilarious. The dialogue practically overflows with hilarious dialogue poking fun at the many social defects of the gamers (""When I visited Codex today, she was interacting with another male. It was akin to a mating ritual. Had they been baboons, her nether regions would have been slightly swollen and ruby red""). And all the subplots come to a boil at the extremely disastrous party.

Felicia Day is even more entertaining in this season, since it has her attempting to interact normally with non-gamer people -- some of whom are almost as weird as she is (Hot Stuntman makes her puke with his zombie makeup). Meanwhile, we see just how nasty Clara can be (and what a party animal!), and get a look at just what a freakshow Vork's life is.

""The Guild Season Two"" is dork magic at its absolutely best -- socially awkward people, massive misunderstandings... and squab. And yes, it leaves you waiting to see what's next.",1331510400,,2463,4.650574712643678
8347634,5,B001XCWNOA,"Having gotten character development out of the way, the second season of The Guild is able to focus on what every fanboy wants: more of Codex (Felicia Day).  The outside world finally intrudes in the form of a handsome stuntman named Wade (Fernando Chien).  Convinced that Zaboo (Sandeep Parikh) is ruining her chances at a date with Wade, she offloads Zaboo to Vork (Jeff Lewis).  Hilarity ensues.

Vork's mannerisms and precise accounting of everything he does is reminiscent of gamers in desperate situations we all know. It's precisely why these gamers play so often.  Vork's own pathetic rings true: his grandfather passed away and Vork lives off of his social security checks. When Zaboo moves in with Vork, it's like the odd couple for the millennial generation.

Meanwhile, we get more insight into Clara's (Robin Thorsen) family. Clara's children derail her quest to retrieve an orb that allows editing a character's appearance, an ability undervalued by the men but coveted by the female gamers. Tinkerballa (Amy Okuda) wins the orb in a bid, setting the hilarious Clara on a revenge streak against Vork that involves multiplaying, lying to her sister, and leaving her husband to take care of the kids. As if that weren't enough drama, Bladezz (Vincent Caso) has fallen to Tinnkerballa's considerable charms and plans to woo her with gifts.

When the game goes on hiatus for hours, it's time for a boys' and girls' night out. What starts out segregated by gender eventually collides in a ping-ponging spiral of egos, alcohol, and hurt feelings. Or to put it another way: comedy gold.

The Guild has one finger on modern dating insecurities and another on gamer culture.  Day knows exactly where to aim her barbed pen. Jokes about first-person shooters (FPS) and massive multiplayer online role-playing gamers (MMORPGs) are, pardon the pun, dead on.",1282348800,,1858,5.045751633986928
