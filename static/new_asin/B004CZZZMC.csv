8424411,2,B004CZZZMC,"BOTTOM LINE: Soupy tries his hand at carrying a feature film on his own... and is stabbed in the back by a lame script & listless directing. BIRDS DO IT is only marginally recommended for die-hard Soupy Sales fans, and those with a masochistic curiosity to see the late comedian in his only starring role. I advise everyone else to steer clear. It would've been better to have lived out my life simply wondering how good (or bad) this film curiosity was without ever actually seeing it. Regrettably, I now know the pitiful truth. Rest in peace Mr. Milton Supman. If only all existing copies of this truly awful film had been buried with you. I felt that BIRDS DO IT laid a big egg so I give it ""The Bird."" 2 STARS

THE STORY: Wacky hijinks ensue when a well-meaning but inept janitor working at NASA is accidentally gifted with the power of flight.

THOUGHTS: I want to preface this review by stating up front that I am a fan of Soupy Sales. He was a truly talented comedian and I have very fond memories of watching the ""new"" version of his classic TV series as a kid when it aired in Detroit back in the early 1980's. The man had a genuinely funny sense of humor and terrific comedic timing. With that being said, this film, (his only starring vehicle), was unbelievably PAINFUL to sit through. It was more like enduring some kind of cruel audio/video torture experiment than watching a movie. The paper-thin premise might have made an amusing episode of a lesser 30-60 minute anthology-type TV series. However the threadbare idea was stretched & padded into what basically amounts to an 80minute surefire cure for insomnia. Even Don Knotts would've passed on this one. (The Reluctant Astronaut is the most hilarious film EVER made, in comparison.) Heck, I've been to funnier funerals.

Now about this film...
After finally getting a chance to check out this obscure curiosity, I have to wonder how it didn't completely destroy Soupy's career. Director Andrew Marton had no clear vision for the story and apparently had no idea how to instruct his actors. We see Soupy run the gambit from straightforward acting & traditional comedy delivery one minute, to breaking the fourth wall and shamelessly mugging for the camera the next. So sad. Soupy deserved better, and so do you. Half of the film's (seemingly endless) running time consists mainly of footage of an obvious Soupy stunt double, flapping his arms and flailing about while strapped into a bulky flying harness poorly disguised under a suit jacket, supported by two thick cables which are clearly visible in 90% of the shots. Sadly, these scenes of ""zany"" hilarity just seem to go on FOREVER!  And to make things even more excruciating, a ""wacky"" musical theme (courtesy of composer/audio torture specialist Samuel Matlovsky) repeats endlessly during these scenes; over & over & over & over again. Ack!  It made me want to jab my eardrums with an icepick. This film is a perfect example of bad comedy. Even young, easily-amused children will be bored to tears. Poor Soupy is at the mercy of a truly awful script & a clueless director. Worse still, he is surrounded by (otherwise talented) actors who have all done much, much better work and apparently signed onto this groan-inducing yawnfest just to pay their rent. Producer Ivan Tors made some pretty decent family-oriented films during his career, and he should have known better. A colossal pie-in-the-face to Tors for foisting this cinematic atrocity onto the movie-going youth of the mid-1960's.

THE DVD: Nothing particularly special about this MOD (Manufactured On Demand) release from Warner Archives. Decent picture & sound. No bonus goodies.",1419379200,4,3663,4.862179487179487
8424412,4,B004CZZZMC,"Let's face it: You're not even going to be looking at this listing unless you're a bit older and a Soupy Sales fan.  While this is obviously a dated comedy, it's still pretty funny and has a lot of subtle snark. And if you like Soupy Sales, you get to see him a bit more sedate than on his TV show. There's a couple of cool cameos and a nice look at Miami Beach in the mid-sixties.",1401235200,,381,3.948051948051948
8424413,5,B004CZZZMC,"1966 film Birds Do It is a great entertaining film . Also for Tab Hunter fans,  he looked terrific in this and plays two parts. I originally saw this at the theatre and loved it. Nice that it is available on DVD.",1358726400,,212,4.0476190476190474
8424414,3,B004CZZZMC,"Having conquered tri-state-area afternoon TV; starring on Broadway in Come Live With Me; promoting a huge Rock and Roll Show at the Brooklyn Paramount (with Little Richard and his guitarist Jimi Hendrix!); cutting a few very credible pop albums; it made sense for Mr. Sales to pack his suitcase for Hollywood!

Tell ya the truth - I couldn't make heads or tail(feathers) of this one, as I watched while rearranging my apartment clutter. But I took serious note of a fine performance by the man, much of it in the style of Harold Lloyd, or any number of classic film comedians you can name. The movie provides alot of action, special effects, and just when things get a little too quiet - wham! bam! - the viewer gets a friendly pie in the face...and asks for more!

The cast is well-chosen and they get the most out of the light script...Tab Hunter even getsto play two roles.

The old fans will love the cameo by TV sidekick, the irrepressible Frank Nastasi, a man of a 1000 faces and voices.

Could have been alot funnier but there are occasions where you gotta believe Soupy got his 2-cents in!! (Listen for familiar catch-lines!).",1324598400,,1134,4.626865671641791
8424415,5,B004CZZZMC,"I'm so glad to see this(1966) movie on DVD!!This is a great comedy curio starring Soupy Sales as a Janitor at NASA who dreams of being a scientist when he starts experimenting in secret there he becomes negatively ionized enableing him to fly and becomes irresistable to women. If you like Don Knotts(Another Great West Virginia Comedian) late 60's movie""The Reluctant Astronaut"" whose character also starts out similiarly as a janitor at NASA and both have the same reknowned supporting Actors Arthur O'Connell,you'll definitely enjoy this one!!",1306368000,6,546,5.287356321839081
