8126828,1,B000FUTVOG,"This is the worst pink floyd DVD in fact the worst DVD that money can buy. Its a collection of old TV interviews badly recorded and cobbled together, there is no link between the interviews or subject matter it just changes mid sentence to another subject making you think the disk has jumped its so bad my 12 year old has done better with youTube uploads. DO NOT BUY THIS unless you have have money to burn. Rgds",1205366400,,413,4.3076923076923075
8126829,4,B000FUTVOG,"From the DVD title I thought I was getting interviews from the DSOTM era, not quite so. The DVD is more like a very fast journey through the entire life of the Band (up to Momentary), with a lot of very short interviews of the band members,mainly Gilmour, Wright and Mason, and Joe Boyd, Peter Jenner, some journalist etc. Roger appears only a couple of times at the end of the DVD(except for some comments from him from a radio interview) . The longest interview is of Nick Mason reviewing DSOTM, and it was done around the time the Band was about to release Momentary Lapse of Reason, it's indeed very interesting as is the rest of the DVD. I think the hardcore fan will like this product very much, the audio and video quality are not the best, but as it is an interviews DVD that's not that important. Is it worth the price?, for me , a hardcore fan, it is, I felt disappointed at first but then I got to like it very quickly and very much  because of how interesting the comments of the members are, for example Rick's comments on Animals and the wall and David's on The Final Cut to name just a couple.",1182384000,4,1108,4.276190476190476
