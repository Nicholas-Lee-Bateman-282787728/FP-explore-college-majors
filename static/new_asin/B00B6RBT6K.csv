8563405,5,B00B6RBT6K,"A far away Spaghetti Western in Epic Kazakh style! This film has been nominated, and won various prizes and awards for the bold ""Gettysburg"" & ""Braveheart"" scale in the open, big sky of the high east. This is a must see, for those interested in different cultures and different history than our own repeated civil war, WWI WWII movies. I felt as if I was peering in on hidden history, enthralled with the skill of these people practically born on horseback. The plot is solid, being foreign, it may take a moment to absorb the full scale. A rewatch with friends made me appreciate this even more. This is not a simpleton, spoon fed no brainier, feeding you every clue while insulting your intelligence. It's nicely done, and the story line moves right along, leaving you yearning for more when it's over.
I think this is what makes it so grand. These original cowboy class people have been wronged and pushed too far, so they must fight for justice and freedom, creating history in this remote part of the world. It reminds me of ""Genghis Khan To The Ends of the Earth and the Sea"" (which is another MUST SEE). I will say, watch this and you will not be disappointed! I searched for this all over the web, singing up with Amazon just because they had a subtitled copy.",1420156800,2,1268,4.517391304347826

This movie could be about the Japanese cousins in their midst.  Don't trust them, don't expect that you can profit from any alliance with them.

They have OFFENDED the Americans.",1409443200,,249,6.967741935483871
8563407,3,B00B6RBT6K,"""Warriors of the Steppe: Myn Bala"" (2012) is a historical movie from Kazakhstan. Set in the early 18th century, the story follows the life of a young warrior Sartay (Assylkhan Tolepov), whose parents were killed by soldiers of the Zunghar Empire when he was a little boy. Seven years later, grown-up Sartay and the Kazakhstani people, hitherto forced to live under the oppression of the empire, stand up and fight for their freedom.

Don't expect gory combat scenes of ""300"" here. While describing the rebellion of young warriors using guerrilla tactics against the Dzungars, the Kazakhstani film emphasizes the process of how the oppressed clans overcome the difference in their opinions. The film also depicts the rivalry between the warriors Sartay and more aggressive Taimas (Ayan Utepbergenov) as well as a romantic subplot, but none of them is really interesting.

More impressive is its authentic locations including the beautiful steppe against the background of snow-capped mountains, as well as the production designs and costumes. Fight scene is few and far in between, but, while the blood is restrained, the brutality is still displayed.

This is Kazakhstan's entry for Best Foreign Language Oscar consideration but failed to be nominated. With a faster-paced narrative and more action sequences, things could have been different, I think.

Those who like this movie may also be interested in a similar-themed film, ""Nomad"" (2005), starring Kuno Becker, Jay Hernandez, Jason Scott Lee and Mark Dacascos, and directed by Sergey Bodrov and Ivan Passer.",1381968000,,1563,5.315789473684211
8563408,2,B00B6RBT6K,"It's a B movie loosely based on the history of Kazakhstani people. In the early 18th century, many of them were slaughtered by the Dzungars (a Mongol tribe descended from Genghis Khan). It's basically a revenge movie. However, its shoe string budget hinders its execution. Consequently, the fighting scenes look primitive. They did not have excitement and the sense of urgency. The acting is not engaging.",1376438400,,405,5.151515151515151
8563409,4,B00B6RBT6K,"If one can excuse the inexcusable political plug in the credits which is so awful it is laughable, this is a well made and well acted film. Technically the picture and sound is excellent and the costumes magnificent. An unusual venture into an offbeat part of the world.",1372464000,,270,4.645833333333333
