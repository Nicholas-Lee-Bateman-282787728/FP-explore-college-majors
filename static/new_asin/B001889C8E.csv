8268761,5,B001889C8E,"As said before by other reviewers, this set doesn't present the best of silent comedy, but obscurities of interest mainly for collectors and already silent film fans. As such, it deserves the five stars.

Said that, the set presents films which, with some isolated exceptions, are truly hard to find and which have never been before on DVD. One of the exceptions is Harold Lloyd's ""Don't Shove"", already on ""Smiles & Spectacles - The Harold Lloyd Treasury"" DVD. Prints are mostly fine, considering the rarity of these items, and in some cases fragmentary. An odd case, however, is Paul Parrott's brilliant short ""POST NO BILLS"", which appears here in a badly shaped and slightly truncated print (the beginning and the end are missing, along with some scenes in the middle). This is worth noting becausa a complete and sharp print of this short is already on DVD on Lobster's outstanding collection ""Retour de Flamme"" (Saved from the flames), VOL.6. This sole fact makes me doubt if some of the not so good prints here do exist in pristine form in some archive, but probably not even the producers of this DVD would be able to answer to that. In any case, we must be thankful for the effort of giving us so many rare items, many of which are also, besides its interest for collector, very funny films indeed.

The Sidney Chaplin shorts are very interesting to watch, as well as his feature ""Charley's Aunt"", which appears here in a complete and sharp print.

Fragmentary are the rare Harold Lloyd's Luke comedy ""Luke Joins the Navy"" (1916), the obscure Snub Pollard item ""Whirl o' the West"", on which Pollard appears with clean face! and the fake Chaplin ""Oh! Shoot"" (1923).

The rest of the set had already been commented. All in all, a great set with obscure items mostly not to be found elsewhere else (some of them appeared on Looser Than Loose DVDs, but these you have to buy on their own site from collector Dave Stevenson, who provided with many of the prints for this set).",1293753600,,1980,4.681034482758621
8268762,4,B001889C8E,"With the major output of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Harry Langdon and, to some degree, even Roscoe Arbuckle now being available on the home video-market in their own exqusite DVD sets, one could think that the mission to have all ""valuable"" silent comedy titles restored for future generations was accomplished. However, one thing anyone who holds these clowns holy (or close) can confirm, is that silent comedy is an interest that is likely to last for life once you get hooked. When you think you've seen it all, Laughsmith Entertainment releases yet another set of rarities which puts beyond doubt that such is not the case. Volume 2 of AMERICAN SLAPSTICK is in several ways even more pleasing than the first volume, and should satisfy buffs of silent comedy longing for more laughs. The set spans 22 years of film history in all, the earliest title being from 1915 and the latest from 1937.

Consisting of three discs in all, the show begins with five of Harold Lloyd's earliest film appearances as the ""Glasses character,"" as well as an excerpt from an older ""Lonesome Luke."" Naturally, Lloyd was at the very beginning of his rise to superstardom at this point, and the lovely, ""regular boy"" of his later films is not that lovely here; he's pretty one-dimensional, as is the universe that evolves around him, but no less do the films provide quite a few worthwhile laughs. The next film, DODGE YOUR DEBTS, is one of the few available films starring Harold's real-life brother Gaylord Lloyd, displaying him as yet another unfortunate tax-collector in the history of silent comedy. This short is not only fun to see to observe the physical resemblance between the two brothers, but also quite a worthwhile comedy in its own right.

Further into Disc One are a few films starring `Snub' Pollard, all of which are amusing, but ultimately feel somewhat like `Snub' Pollard himself; a competent performer, good fun for a while, but not too engaging beyond that. I'm grateful that more of his films are made available, but Pollard himself is hardly more than a tool for the gags in most cases, and as he unlike Harold Lloyd never progressed into anything more (or less), three films at a time like here feels appropriate.

The next three films starring James Parrott, brother of the more famous Charles ""Charley Chase"" Parrott, are a long-awaited treat to fans of Chase in search for a more comprehensive study of the brother's skills. A more surprising gem is A FRESH START starring the forgotten Jimmie Adams and Lige Conley, which provides plenty of clever gags in an action-loaded short. KID SPEED displays the more famous, but often neglected Larry Semon, a comedian I have, at best, mixed feelings about; although clearly a very capable gagman, Semon tends to be a bit too ""mechanical"" for my taste. Even so, I encourage the efforts to make more of his films available.

The final two films on Disc One may be the foremost reason why I bought this set in the first place; that is, two films starring the (once again) all too often neglected but brilliant ""poor soul comedian"" Lloyd Hamilton, in JONAH JONES and BREEZING ALONG. Few of Hamilton's films surive today, and even fewer are accessible to the public, so I'm very glad to have these two titles included here. Unfortunately, by the time BREEZING ALONG was made in 1927, Hamilton's often difficult personal life had diminished his creativity somewhat compared to just a few years before, but his talent is still evident.

Disc Two is all Chaplin, though Charlie isn't really in any of the films. First out are a few of the ""Chaplin Cartoons"" of the 1910s by Sullivan/Messmer, before we get to see yet another, pretty amusing film starring the best of the many Chaplin-impersonators, Billy West. However, the real treat of this disc is seeing Chaplin's brother Sydney starring in three shorts as well as a feature (being the only one in the set). In the short CAUGHT IN A PARK, Syd manages to throw in quite a few clever gags, along with his own energetic performance, in a Keystone-farce which otherwise would've appeared as rather standard procedure. Disc Three consists of the decent Billy Bevan-short BE REASONABLE, Neal Burns in CALL THE WAGON, an early talkie appearance with Louise Fazenda, and others displaying more obscure names. Sure enough, some of the films are funnier than others; while there is much ingenuity, some films appear pretty standard. Nonetheless, I was never bored while watching, which is the most important thing.

As for the presentation, this is where Laughsmith satisfies to an even more astonishing degree than in the previous volume. Each performer is provided with a short, narrated presentation before his/her work is shown, making it even more intriguing to observe and enjoy the individuality of their skills. The booklet inside includes an introduction by historian David Kalat, president of All Day Entertainment, and a fascinating essay by Steve Massa in which both the performers and their films, as well as silent comedy in general, is studied at closer distance. As to the films themselves, they are generally as sharp as one could expect from films of this era; of course there are scratches in most of them, and a few segments are even badly damaged, but I'm just glad these films are made available for us to see at all.

Those of you who have yet to check out the major work of Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd I'd advise to hunt for CITY LIGHTS and SAFETY LAST! first, but if you are well acquainted with such gems and still hungry for more, this set is essential. Being familiar with the genre, you are probably aware that even though the VERY best is already seen, what remains can be quite a joy as well.",1249430400,7,5728,4.820956256358087
8268763,4,B001889C8E,"If you love silent film, if you find yourself drawn to archival collections of rarely seen movie gems and especially if you have a taste for broad comedy - you'll enjoy this new set from Facets.

There are two shorts from the `30s at the very end of the set - but it's essentially a collection of silents. And, because this is a silents set, you'll want to know that the audio track is entertaining. You'll hear some Scott Joplin here and other piano riffs from long ago. Some silent DVD releases in recent years have gone out of their way to enhance the audio experience, including offering multiple audio settings for the films. This is a single standard soundtrack -- nevertheless, lots of fun and well performed.

Here's what I think is most intriguing about this collection:

I reviewed this 3-disc set in the same week that the Seth Rogen comedy, ""Pineapple Express,"" hit theaters and I got hooked on jotting down all the comic bits in these silent comedies that I had just seen in the new Rogen comedy. In fact, a clever film student could take the script of ""Pineapple Express,"" listing all the slapstick bits one after another - and edit clips from silent films to fill the same script, virtually start to finish.

It's remarkable, really. Here's an example: In one fight scene, Rogen and his nemesis wrestle with Rogen's bulky figure half bent over a low counter, flipping around and tangling together. That's standard business from silent film. In this collection, it's Harold Lloyd fighting over the counter in a general store.

One bit after another, they're all here. Before I was done, I stopped jotting down the corresponding scenes because there were dozens.

What's more, in this set of comedies, you'll meet some rarely seen comic heroes - like Lloyd Hamilton, who is basically a Seth Rogen from the silent era. Like Rogen, Hamilton certainly didn't cut the typical figure of a leading man. Yet, he was attractive to the girls in his films, largely because of his loveable, hapless, persistent style. Like Rogen, his trademarks were a pudgy figure, a puzzled expression alternated with a confident smile, and his big round face. In ""Pineapple,"" Rogen plays virtually the entire film in an ill-fitting suit, which was a Lloyd Hamilton trademark, as well.

This new collection is great fun - plus, if you've a taste for cultural history, you'll make all sorts of connections while you're chuckling.",1218067200,3,2415,4.818840579710145
8268764,3,B001889C8E,"I just received my copy of the three-disc set.  I like the general way in which they have presented the material.  Excellent musical scores composed for each film are worth noting.  The organizing of each section is also thoughtful: by studio, star or genre.  The quality of most of the films is not first rate however.  When compared to the quality of KINO or Image Entertainment or even Lobster Films, these films are slightly out of focus and look like copies from videos at times.  I'm no expert in this area, but like the first box they put out, the quality is only fair.  On the other hand they have some real gems assembled, few if any of which are to be found on other discs (though I do have some on VHS).
This is a nice filler for the collector, with Gaylord Lloyd, Alice Howell and Anne Cornwall among others to be discovered and enjoyed.  just wish I didn't have to squint a tad to do it!",1217548800,6,900,4.315476190476191
8268765,4,B001889C8E,"Prominent in this assortment of silent comedies are Harold Lloyd and his brother Gaylord, along with the usual cast of Hal Roach players. Charle Chaplin doesn't appear here, but is represented by imitators like Billy West. Also, his half-brother Syd stars in three of these. There's a few with female headliners, some from Lloyd Hamilton Corp (Educational Studios), and several nearly-forgotten Hal Roach releases. Two 1930s sound shorts complete the program.

Due to this material's obscurity, AMERICAN SLAPSTICK, Vol. 2 will best appeal to silent movie fans looking to give their collections depth. For anyone just starting a silent comedy library (and who prefer DVD multi-packs), recommended are the more mainstream artists available on these 'budget' sets:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-BUSTER-KEATON-COLLECTION/dp/B000LC3IR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE BUSTER KEATON COLLECTION</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SMILES-SPECTACLES-The-Harold-Lloyd-Treasury/dp/B000KGH0DO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SMILES & SPECTACLES - The Harold Lloyd Treasury</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CHARLIE-CHAPLIN-51-Features/dp/B0009PLLPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CHARLIE CHAPLIN - 51 Features</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LOST-AND-FOUND-The-Harry-Langdon-Collection/dp/B000WC8CLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LOST AND FOUND: The Harry Langdon Collection</a>.
