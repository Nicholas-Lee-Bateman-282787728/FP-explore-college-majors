All of the books ""reviewed"" by the posters are from Leisure Arts.  Coincidence?  I think not.  Because of these false reviews I will NOT purchase anything from Leisure Arts.

2554463,5,B000F7MG1E,"Crochet Stitches in Motion (DVD) is wonderful. I am a complete novice at crocheting. I find it very easy to follow at all times. I am left handed so I really have a hard time learning any stitches from anyone because of this. Anyone who really has a hard time following someone else's instructions, I suggest that you purchase this. It's just great and very reasonable. You can learn at your own pace.

2554466,5,B000F7MG1E,This DVD is absolutely fantastic! The stitch-alongs are wonderful and I just love all the different projects.  The best part about it is that you will learn soooo much that after a while you'll be able to personalize each of the projects or go into a completely different direction and make something completely all your own.

2554467,5,B000F7MG1E,"Crochet Stitches in Motion was perfect for a newbie to crocheting like me because the ""Basic Refresher"" section brought me right up to speed.  This dvd has a ton of projects and the step-by-step instructions makes it sooo easy to learn even the more challenging patterns.  Even though I've only had this dvd for a few weeks I feel like I've learned enough to venture out and explore my own project ideas.  Crochet Stitches in Motion is a tremendous resource, go and buy it NOW!",1159488000,,477,4.588235294117647
2554468,5,B000F7MG1E,"Crochet Stitches in Motion is a great DVD with stitches for all skill levels.  It has 12 pattern stitches with a great Stitch-Along so you can learn them at your own pace.  The Fashion Show was really cool because you can see the finished products in different forms for extra ideas.  In addition, there's 8 bonus projects that really allow you to explore your creativity.  This DVD is a ""must have"" for crocheters because you'll learn everything from a simple single crochet ridge pattern to challenging multi-chain patterns.  I learned so much and now I'm making different Hats and Afghans for all my friends.",1158883200,,611,4.836538461538462
2554469,5,B000F7MG1E,"I was recovering from surgery and had lots of time on my hands. I was watching lots of DVD's (movies mostly) was getting tired of that. I came across these crochet Leisure Arts DVD's and thought I'd  give them a try. I crocheted a while ago and figured this would be a good time to get back into it. This DVD has a ""basic refresher"" section which was perfect. Everything came back and I was ready to dive into the 12 pattern stitches.

Wow! This is so much fun!! The act of crocheting was so relaxing and it felt great to be creative. There's a nice selection of projects to make with the stitches you learn and you may even feel daring enough to make up some projects of your own.

I loved this DVD so much, I also bought ""Crochet Fashions In Motion"", which I also reviewed.",1154563200,35,775,4.222972972972973
2554470,1,B000F7MG1E,I am familiar with the basic crochet stitches.  I wanted to learn how to create the stitches from this dvd.  I watched for a while and tried working along.  I could not keep up with the teacher.,1346630400,,194,4.1891891891891895
2554471,4,B000F7MG1E,I finally bought this after checking it out of the library too many times. This is a great DVD. I really learn more and more the more I watch it. There are lots to this DVD too. I use my laptop so it allows more flexibility to move around on it. I recommend it to new crochet-ers because the lessons are fun. The way she teaches is great. It is just a great DVD.,1320019200,3,362,3.9054054054054053
2554472,1,B000F7MG1E,"I thought that since the title says ""crochet in motion"" and the description says you sit shoulder to shoulder with the crochet expert that you would actually watch the person making the stitches.  I have the ""I Can't Believe I'm Crocheting"" with Melissa Leapman also by Leisure Arts and you actually get to watch Melissa making the stitches.  In this DVD, all of the pattern stitches and extra projects are in writing.  You do not get to watch someone making the stitches. Since I am a beginner, I did not find this DVD to be any easier than trying to read a pattern.  If I knew how to read and understand the pattern, I would not have needed to purchase the DVD.  There are still several terms that I just do not understand.",1291593600,59,725,4.421052631578948

2554475,3,B000F7MG1E,"My husband bought me the ""I Can't Believe I Am Crocheting in Motion"" DVD last year. I Learned everything about crocheting that a beginner needs to know. I knew nothing about crocheting. Thanks to the DVD my husband bought me I have crocheted a scarf and a granny square mini purse. Thanks to Melissa Leapman's great teaching. I was excited about watching ""Crochet Stitches In Motion"". I figured since it was the same DVD series that Melissa would be the instructor but she is not unfortunately.

I Found this DVD at my local library. I popped the DVD into my player as soon as I got home. I was disappointed by the instructor. She is not as precise with instructions as Melissa Leapman from the ""I Can't Believe I Am Crocheting"" DVD.

The instructor did not seem very professional. I found her voice annoying. She sounded to sweet. From the way the woman talks it sounds as if she is talking to kindergarten kids.

The instructor does not give helpful hints along the way like Melissa did. Also Melissa acted as if she was sitting next to you from the way she talked.

I knkow for a fact that I am not purchasing this DVD. IF I need to see it again I will check it out from my library. This DVD is not worth the $20 it costs. Now if Melissa Leapman had been the instructor it would be worth the price.

If there is another Crochet DVD released for the in motion series I just hope that Melissa is the instructor. I wish this DVD would be redone with Melissa as the teacher. I would buy it then.",1219104000,21,1494,4.321428571428571
2554476,5,B000F7MG1E,"I took a private crochet lesson a few weeks ago after my Aunt taught me the basic stitches.  The place I took lessons from is almost an hour away from my house, so I can't just jump in the car and go for help.  I bought this DVD in hopes to refresh my memory.  I didn't expect it to be as wonderful as it is.  It was like having private lessons and I can pause and rewind when I need to.  I was working on a baby afghan, basically just working double crochets to practice tension and after doing a practice swatch of one of the stitch patterns, I pulled out all the stitches and started over.  I can't wait to check out what other stiches and it is great to have an encyclopedia of terms and such on the DVD!",1217980800,2,708,3.9858156028368796
2554477,1,B000F7MG1E,"There isn't anything on amazon where EVERYONE gives an item five stars. Someone, even those who like items, often have a suggestion to make it better and give it a few less stars. It seems pretty odd that all the reviewer would be reveiwer for only one company and each one would give a five star review.

2554479,5,B000F7MG1E,"I bought this DVD and was only crocheting a granny square at the time being. Yet this wonderful DVD taught me a lot more stitches and was so very helpful in my opinion.
I wish they would come out with more on just stitches like showing how to on 100 stitches etc with nothing but stitches on the DVD
