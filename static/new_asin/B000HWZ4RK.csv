2646988,5,B000HWZ4RK,I used to love this show when I was a kid.  It had everything action comedy and great animation.  I can not wait to own this DVD because they are the Gummi Bears!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1158192000,2,191,4.757575757575758
2646989,5,B000HWZ4RK,"I used to wake up at 7:00am before school to watch this show. I absolutely love this show, it is one of the best cartoons of the early 90's, and to finally have it on dvd is nothing short of a miracle. Thank you whoever is responsible. Watch this show, especially if you love classic saturday morning cartoons!",1157846400,5,310,4.362068965517241
2646990,5,B000HWZ4RK,"Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears finally gets its well-deserved DVD treatment.  I think that Gummi Bears was the first of Disney's syndicated animated shows in the 80s, and paved the way for later classics like Duck Tales and Tale Spin.

I came across recordings of these shows a short while ago and watched a lot of them.  Even though the show is nearly twenty years old, I was struck by the quality of the animation and the voice work, which included veteran voice actors like June Foray (of Rocky the Flying Squirrel fame) and Paul Winchell (best known by people my age and younger for his work as Tigger).

The rich fantasy setting of this show and the detail put into the Gummi Bears and the remnants of their old society are impressive.  I think most impressive was that the fact that this show was not made to market action figures, like so many other shows of the 80s.  All of the Gummi Bears are distinctive and each has their own appeal, and the other heroes and villains are likewise well-developed and fun to watch, whether it's Cavan and Princess Calla or the villain Duke Igthorn.

There is a lot of humor and heart, enough to please adults as well as children, which is always the mark of a great program.  I actually still remembered one episode from nearly twenty years ago, ""For A Few Sovereigns More"", which surprisingly had a great reference to Clint Eastwood that made me laugh harder as an adult than I did when I was a kid.

Overall, this is a great series that is possibly even better now than when it was first released, and one that is definitely worthy of owning.",1156809600,88,1596,4.494809688581315
2646991,5,B000HWZ4RK,"Okay I'm not going to waste time on how great this series is. It started what is widely known as the ""Golden Age"" of Disney television cartoon series. Gummi Bears started it all. The quality of this series is undeniable. Gummi Bears paved the way for other ""Golden Age"" series like the Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, Ducktales, Chip N' Dale's Rescue Rangers, Talespin, Darkwing Duck, Goof Troop, and Gargoyles.

Gummi Bears spread over many seasons taking our Gummi pals from the simple world of medival Gummi Glen to places far from home.

Great fun!

Great adventure!

Great animation!

A true piece of Disney magic!

Unlike many other shows of the time, this is timeless family entertainment.",1156809600,8,695,4.897435897435898
2646992,5,B000HWZ4RK,"Finally!!!! Gummi Bears is on DVD!

It should have been released with DuckTales, if not before then.  Thankfully, Disney is releasing it.

Gummi Bears had superb writing and was the perfect show for a kid.  I could never get over how sharp the animation was.  This cartoon would be the vanguard for the Disney Afternoon.  Before it played in the Disney Afternoon, it aired on Saturday mornings.  It was always my number one goal to catch it at 10 or 11 AM.  Gummi Bears held its own among other great hits of the 80s.

Lets hope they start DVD 1 with the very first episodes and don't mess it up like they did DuckTales.  I think DuckTales and the others sold well enough for Disney to realize there is a market for their late 80s and early 90s cartoons.  These years were the golden years for recent Disney animation.  None of the new cartoons or any of the late 90s cartoons hold a candle to the Disney Afternoon originals.

I think Disney heard the consumers and made the right choice.  If it sells, they'll probably release the whole series.  Thanks Disney (or whoever in the Disney bureaucracy made this possible)!",1156377600,39,1119,4.525

2646994,5,B000HWZ4RK,I would buy the series but there's actually six seasons instead of three. But overall this is one of the series other than the Smurfs that Disney's put out,1453161600,,155,4.379310344827586

Well, for starters, it's the first syndicated cartoon series that Disney made and the absolute best! Watching these episodes brings me such a cascade of memories that warms my heart and fills me up with nostalgia. I've read that 3 more seasons were made, but I've looked everywhere to purchase them...to no avail.

2647131,5,B000HWZ4RK,Brings back good memories. I loved gummi bears when I was a kid. Saturday morning cartoons were the best. Great.,1372550400,,112,4.65
2647132,5,B000HWZ4RK,"I used to watch Gummi Bears for a bit when I was really little.  I didn't constantly watch it like Ducktales or Rescue Rangers, but it really stuck with me.  More so than Care Bears, which I remember was on around when I watched Gummi Bears.  I remember five times as much about Gummi Bears as I do about Care Bears, which should say something.  The only reason I watched Care Bears a few years later was the plethora of VHS tapes for it, while the Gummi Bears didn't even get one single episode released here.  What I would give for that ratio to be reversed.  But enough Care Bears bashing, I got this DVD the day it came out & it held up so well, my whole family liked watching it with me!  Even my dad, who didn't remember this show & couldn't get past the fact that it should be about candy bears sat down & watched one of my favorites (Gummi In a Guilded Cage) & admitted it was good, & watched most of the other episodes.  This is easily one of the greatest cartoons to come out of the 80's, heck it's one of the best ever.  It was the first Disney cartoon show & paved the way and influenced many others (Like I kid you not, Gargoyles.  Greg Weisman said so himself on the commentary for the first Gargoyles episode).  I often find it unfairly labeled a little kid's show, while Ducktales is aimed at the same age group & is praised as a classic.  They aren't terribly far off for Ducktales, but I like this show better as the character relationships are much more entertaining (in Ducktales my favorite character interactions were always that of Scrooge and Launchpad, but here I'd be hard-pressed to decide whether I like Grammi & Gruffi's bickering, Cubbi & Cavin's friendship or Gruffi & Gusto's opposite views more), the adventures more exciting, & the history of the Gummi Bears being one of the most fascinating things I've ever seen in a cartoon.  And let's not forget the good animation and the all-star voice cast.  Lorenzo Music, Paul Winchell (except for the last season), June Foray & even Bill Scott, the man who voiced Bullwinkle, in one of his last roles (as Gruffi & Toady, but he died after the first season, though the guy who replaced him was perfect) all provide voices.  I was not surprised when I learned that instead of churning out 65 episodes at once they made that many over 6 seasons.  They took their time making these and it really shows.  Here's a review of every episode from the first 3 seasons, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.

1.  A New Beginning:  Cavin, a knight-in-training in the Dunwyn Kingdom, is left in the woods after a group of ogres run off his human allies.  There, he stumbles into the home of the fabled Gummi Bears while trying to find his Great Gummi Medallion, which was left to him by his grandfather.  When learning of an incoming attack by Duke Igthorn, Dunwyn's disgraced knight turned traitor, Cavin must convince his new friends to help stop this enemy while promising to keep the Gummies' existence a secret.  B

2a.  The Sinister Sculptor:  A sculptor changes all the Gummies except for Gruffi and Grammi into statues with magic dust.  Meanwhile, Gruffi and Grammi are frequently fighting and don't want to work together.  King Gregor then buys the statues for Princess Calla.  So it's up to Gruffi, Grammi and Cavin to turn the others back to normal.  A

2b.  Zummi Makes It Hot:  The Gummis are nearly out of Gummiberry juice so Grammi needs to make more, but the spigot is stuck so Zummi, Grammi, Cubbi, and Cavin go to the pumping station to fix the problem.  A

3a.  Someday My Prints Will Come:  While exploring an ancient storeroom of the Great Gummis, Tummi discovers a mechanical decoy used to make dragon footprints, but accidentally starts the ignition on the machine and begins bouncing all across the land. The footprints then attract a real dragon.  The first episode I ever saw.  It totally won me over & to this day it & the second one are 2 of my favorites.  A+

3b.  Can I Keep Him?:  Zummi gives Cubbi a whistle from his old treasure chest while Sunni is having trouble babysitting Cubbi.  The whistle attracts a brine dragon, which takes Sunni and Cubbi on an unexpected adventure to Drekmore Castle.  A+

4.  Gummi In a Guilded Cage:  Sunni is kidnapped by a flock of ugly bird-like creatures known as Carpies, whose king wants her for a song bird.  The male Gummis must use their new flying machine to get to the top of the mountain and rescue her.  A+

5a.  The Oracle:  While trying to sneak out of his new diet, Tummi finds a stone ogre oracle and uses it to trick Duke Igthorn and the ogres with it.  A

5b.  When You Wish Upon a Stone:  Cavin is having problems with knight training, so he and Cubbi explore several solutions against a giant guarding a wishing stone.  C

6.  A Gummi By Any other Name:  Zummi makes a magic hat for Sunni, which can change her appearance to anyone she wants by speaking that person's name, and Sunni turns herself into Princess Calla to enjoy the comforts of royalty.  Coincidentally, the real Princess Calla is kidnapped by Igthorn while going outside Dunwyn's castle walls.  When the two princess contestants meet in a Drekmore tower cell, what will happen once the true princess exerts her right of existence?  A-

7a.  Loopy Go Home:  Despite Gruffi's objections, Cubbi finds a wolf cub and raises it.  A

7b.  A Hunting We Will Go:  With a vicious wild boar on the loose in Dunwyn Forest, Calla, Sunni and Grammi must warn King Gregor, Sir Tuxford and Cavin before they end up being hunted themselves.  A-

8a.  The Fence Sitter:  A bird threatens the Gummiberry bushes and nobody will listen to Cubbi's ideas to get rid of it.  A+

8b.  Night of the Gargoyle:  Duke Igthorn sends a cursed gargoyle to King Gregor.  The gargoyle comes alive at night and starts trying to destroy things - including the king himself.  A

9.  Secret of the Juice:  Grammi believes it is time to teach another Gummi Bear how to make Gummiberry juice.  Sunni is chosen as the most eligible candidate, but is more into fashion and spending time with Calla.  The Ogres kidnap Grammi and take her to Castle Drekmore, where Duke Igthorn attempts to coax the recipe for Gummiberry juice from her.  A-

10a.  Sweet and Sour Gruffi:  The Gummies try to sweeten Gruffi's sour disposition by magic, but the conditions of the spell they use turn this affair into a two-edged sword.  D

10b.  Duel of the Wizards:  The pompous wizard Don Gordo will not accept Zummi's help in finding his missing magic key, so a battle of magic ensues.  This is much better.  I recommend that after watching The Oracle, skip to this one & never watch 5b. or 10a.  A

Disc 2

11a.  What You See Is Me:  Tummi learns through his new friend, the blind shepherd Trina, that the handicapped don't always need help.  A

11b.  Toadie's Wild Ride:  Duke Igthorn catapults Toadie into the forest, where he accidentally makes his way into Gummi Glen and begins snooping around.  When Tummi, who has been caught eating the other bears' picnic lunches and lying about it, sees him, no one believes him when he tries to tell them.  A

12a. Bubble Trouble:  Sunni finds a baby cliff dragon with a hiccup, and a swig of Gummiberry juice only aggravates the problem.  C-

12b.  Gummi In a Strange Land:  A Slumber Sprite puts Gruffi to sleep, requiring Grammi and Cubbi to trek across hostile terrain to find the sprite and keep Gruffi from suffering nasty accidents.  A

13.  Light Makes Right:  The Gummies find a Gummiscope, a gigantic machine that harnesses sunlight as a means of long-range communication, that could allow them to make contact with the ancient Gummis across the ocean - but it can also be used as a weapon, causing Duke Igthorn to use it as a laser to intimidate King Gregor into abdication.  Great episode until the ending, which was a little unfair.  A-

14.  Up, Up and Away:  Chummi Gummi comes to Gummi Glen in search for other Gummis. When he finds them, he offers to take them to the Great Gummis.  Cubbi wants to leave with him so he can become a knight, but Chummi's flying ship presents another opportunity for Igthorn to claim rulership over Dunwyn.  The perfect episode to start off season 2 with.  A+

15a.  Faster Than a Speeding Tummi:  Tummi cleans up his act and learns faster is not better - especially when it's done with uncontrollable magic.  A

15b.  For a Few Sovereigns More:  Duke Igthorn hires a bounty hunter to catch a Gummi Bear. When he refuses to pay, the hunter locks up Igthorn, the ogres, and Cubbi.  A+

16a.  Over The River and Through the Trolls:  Trolls try to hijack a shipment of gold protected by Sir Gawain.  A

16.  You Snooze, You Lose:  Igthorn puts Dunwyn to sleep, leaving only Calla, Cavin, and the Gummi Bears to protect the castle.  A+

17.  The Crimson Avenger:  Cubbi's first appearance as his alter ego the Crimson Avenger.  I loved the idea of the Crimson Avenger, & despite 2 major logic breaks concerning Cavin & Calla I still enjoyed this episode.  A-

18a.  A Hard Dazed Knight:  Duke Igthorn sneaks into Dunwyn Castle and hands King Gregor a magical egg that turns the king into a crystal statue.  Igthorn then says that he will destroy the egg unless the people of Dunwyn accept him as their new king.  Gruffi and Calla use a mechanical knight to infiltrate Igthorn's castle and retrieve the egg.  A

18b.  Do Unto Ogres:  Sunni creates a growing potion while Toadie is cast out by Duke Igthorn. The two meet to unexpected results.  A

19.  For Whom the Spell Holds:  Zummi finds a section of the Great Book of Gummi that contains advanced magic spells.  However, this also signals Zorlok, an evil wizard whom the Great Gummis had imprisoned in a subterranean prison, that he can find the unlocking spell then be free to inflict violence on all Gummi Bears the world over, then conquer the world.  A+

20a.  Little Bears Lost:  There is a thief in Gummi Glen, so Zummi and Grammi team up to find the rat.  Unfortunately, a botched spell keeps them trapped in diminutive size.  C

20b.  Guess Who's Gumming To Dinner?:  Sunni goes overboard trying to impress Calla for the Gummi holiday of Fall's Farewell.  I personally skip from Gummi In a Strange Land to this episode.  A+

Disc 3

21.  My Gummi Lies Over the Ocean:  When Tummi builds a boat, Gruffi tries to convince him to dismantle it, but reluctantly agrees to one trip.  This trip takes an unexpected turn when they end up on a volcanic island inhabited only by another Gummi Bear - an artist by the name of Gusto.  The first appearance of Gusto, who is not only my favorite character but one of the most seamless cast additions I have ever seen in any TV show.  The perfect episode to end season 2 on.  A+

22a.  Too Many Cooks:  A famous Taffy maker (candy maker) pays one last visit to Dunwyn before he retires.  Tummi, Sunni and Cubbi manage to get a hold of his secret recipe, but their efforts to replicate the chef's favorite are not crowned with success - not theirs, anyway.  B

22b.  Just a Tad Smarter:  Toadwart's smart and bossy cousin Tadpole arrives at Drekmore and initiates a coup d'tat among his fellow Ogres. Seeing the new change of command a greater threat to them and the Gummiberry bushes, the Gummies do something highly unexpected: help their long-standing nemesis.  A+

23a.  If I Were You:  Igthorn tries to infiltrate Gummi Glen by magically switching places with Tummi while the bears plan Tummi's birthday surprise.  A-

23b.  Eye of the Beholder:  An ugly witch named Marzipan who can turn herself into a beautiful woman enchants Princess Calla and all of Dunwyn into doing her bidding, and King Gregor into making her his queen so she can rob Dunwyn's treasury.  It is up to Sunni to break Marzipan's spell.  F

24a.  Presto Gummo:  Tummi wants to learn magic like Zummi.  A bored Cubbi uses stunts to fool Tummi into thinking he is an actual magician.  But when Igthorn captures Tummi, Cubbi must think of a way to free Tummi, when Tummi proposes the idea of sleight of hand.  A

24b.  A Tree Grows In Dunwynn:  The trolls have escaped from the dungeon of Castle Dunwyn and are looking for stolen gold reserves.  When they see the gold was stored in an apple tree meant as a gift for King Gregor, the trolls take the Gummi Glen Gummis as hostages.  A

25.  Day of the Beevilweevils:  Tummi builds what he thinks is a bee-caller, but it instead attracts beevilweevils, insects that devour the Gummiberry bushes.  Tummi and Gusto then go on a dangerous mission to locate a replacement Gummiberry sapling.  A+

26a.  Water Way To Go:  Sunni and Gusto meet a mermaid, Aquarianne, and her sea beast guardian, Finwithit.  When Igthorn captures Aquarianne and uses Finwithit to attack Dunwyn, it's up to Sunni and Gusto to save her - and Dunwyn.  A+

26b.  Close Encounters of the Gummi Kind:  When Gusto invents a decoy to lure ogres away from Gummi Glen, it fools the ogres, but also attracts the humans, who start looking around the forest.  It is up to Gruffi and Gusto to save the glen.  A+

27a.  Snows Your Old Man:  While trying to find out why winter is still persisting in Dunwyn alone, Tummi, Sunni and Cubbi encounter a mischievous frost giant named Chillbeard who wants to have a good time by making it snow.  B

27b.  Boggling the Bears:  Sunni saves a squirrel-like shapechanger, a Boggle, from a hungry wolf and takes it back home. But a shapechanger - not to mention a whole family of them - tends to make a rather tedious pet!  B

28.  Knights of Gummadoon:  When the castle of the knights of Gummadoon appears, Cavin is imprisoned as a spy.  The Gummies only have until sunset to rescue him, as the castle only appears once every hundred years, but they also have to contend with Duke Igthorn, who plans to capture the castle.  This should have been the last episode of the season.  A+

29a.  Mirthy Me:  A Gigglin causes a practical joke spree in the Glen. Will this stop the dam from being built in time to stop the water from flooding in?  F

29b.  Gummi Dearest:  Cubbi is mistaken for a baby griffin and Gruffi has his hands full with a baby griffin. Can they get out of the situation without making the mother griffin too angry?  B

So out of 29 episodes there's only one bad episode per disc, which leaves 23 episodes ranging from A- to A+ & 3 other good ones besides.  Just remember to save the Knights of Gummadoon for last so you can end the set on a high note.  Everybody should get this as it's a wonderful cartoon to show their kids, and maybe if enough people buy it then they'll release seasons 4-6 in one big 36 episode box set.  Until then, keep on bouncing Gummi Bear fans!",1372291200,,14644,4.513596323247798

2647185,5,B000HWZ4RK,"This show is utterly, completely awesome and incredible.  This is the moment where Eisner took the studio that just did The Black Cauldron and DARED to go once again into Fantasy land (this time in the realm of violent, crime drama, horrendously tacky television).  This show and the absolutely fabulous fantasy bears who are the main focus in many ways SAVED DISNEY.  The reason why you watch Pixar films today and even productions like The Little Mermaid owe much to the awesome bears of Gummi Glen.  This show became a success on several levels.  First, it established what would become known as The Disney Afternoon.  In doing so, Disney trampled right over the ambitions of another network called Nickelodeon.  There is even an episode later in the series with ""Mysterious Cities of Gold"" innuendo that I found amusing (with Cubbi doing peace gestures).  Second, this show saved Disney as a relevant brand.  Recovering from the box office disaster of The Black Cauldron, Disney found TELEVISION footing with the bears.  Networks (NBC, ABC) fought each other to broadcast this show during the 80's and early 90's.  It is because of this that movies like Little Mermaid and The Lion King were created, with the bears as a guiding force.

Gummi Bears, the series itself tells the tale of a tribe of culturally advanced bears who are trying to get in touch with both their surviving relatives and ancestors.  It is very much a FAMILY show with the bears forming a tribe of unique individuals who are thrown together to be a family.  The world around them is a breathtaking Fantasy world full of adventure and danger.. the danger often taking the form of one of Disney's most cleverly aggressive villains, the Duke Igthorn.  Duke Igthorn is a singular figure (anti family) that commands an army of ogres with the goal of controlling not only the Kingdom, but eventually the entire world for only his singular enjoyment.  He is very much a HUMAN MAN, with flaws and brilliant moments.. indeed, one of Disney's more interesting villains.  The bears often use their power as a family to save not only themselves but their ""extended"" human family (extremely cute Princess Calla, Cavin, King Gregor).  Throughout the course of the series, the bears overcome the past hate between them and the humans while experiencing incredible adventures.  Btw, this DVD has possibly the greatest menu music ever devised, rivaling tracks by Lemon Jelly in terms of pure bliss.

It is interesting to note that Disney was very brave in going BACK to Fantasy after The Black Cauldron.  It was a tremendously risky move but with the Gummi Bears IT WORKED.  The reason why is because anyone who is a fan of Tolkien, Lloyd Alexander, or Fantasy as a genre could watch the show and believe it might be part of that world.  It also fit the time very well, kids with their new Nintendo systems and a copy of The Legend of Zelda would be EXACTLY the type of demographic that would watch Gummi Bears.  Indeed, after playing Final Fantasy XI for several years, I watch Gummi Bears with a new appreciation.  Fantasy is alive and as a genre it did save Disney in that most unlikely of places, tacky crime drama, talk show wasteland of television.  In carving out the Fantasy niche, television reeled back, suddenly aware of the wholesome goodness that suddenly populated its landscape.  As characters like the achingly endearing Cubbi, the crazy Zummi and burly Gruffi ventured forth, television found that it would be forever changed.  Indeed, The Disney Afternoon resonates even to this day.

As a side note, great soundtrack for the show Disney.  If there is ever a Brave 2 or something along those lines, a Gummi Bear cameo would be much appreciated!
Btw, as rumor has it, the event that saved Disney was triggered by Eisner's son requesting Gummy Bears one day.",1358121600,2,3833,4.825421133231241

2647232,5,B000HWZ4RK,"The minute I pop in the DVD and hear the theme song, I'm immediately transported back to my childhood. I'm resting on the floor on my belly; propped up on my elbows; a plate of chocolate chip pancakes in front of me.

Meet the main Gummis:
Grammi-the matriarch that isn't exactly culinarily capable. She is courageous and unafraid to speak her mind, much to the frustration of Gruffi.

Gruffi-he may have a gruff exterior but inside, he's a soft-hearted Gummi. He likes everything organized and is very protective of his family and Gummi Glen.

Sunni-sometimes acts before she thinks. She tries to find clever ways to make the Gummis' lives easier. But she has to learn the lesson the hard way: Easier doesn't mean better. She mostly dreams to be like her best friend, Princess Calla.

Zummi-an adorable auto dyslexic that tries his hardest to be a master magician like the Ancient Gummis but due to his problems of mixing up his words, the spells sometimes turn on him. He treasures the Great Book of Gummi and studies from it every day.

Cubbi(a.k.a. the 'Crimson Avenger')-young and energetic, he aspires to be a great knight someday and often hangs out with his best friend, Cavin. Both pretend to be adventurers, thwarting the bad guys of Dunwyn.

Tummi-a softie through and through. Though a bit slow, he makes up for it with a big heart. His biggest weakness is when Grammi makes his favorite dish: leftovers.

Gusto-an artist and sculptor and the most eccentric of all the Gummis. He prefers to live in a cave behind a waterfall instead of Gummi Glen. He was found on a sinking island in the 3rd disc, ""My Gummi Lies Over the Ocean"". His constant companion: Artie Deco, an intelligent toucan who has no problem critiquing Gusto's work.

After the Gummis fled over the ocean from the jealous humans, these 6 Gummis were the only ones left in the land of Dunwyn. They were the keepers of Gummi Glen until it was safe enough for the rest of the Gummis to return.

The Gummi Bears do their best to avoid humans but along the way, they made two trusted friends--Squire Cavin and Princess Calla. The fact that they avoid most humans does not stop these Gummis from protecting Dunwyn Castle and all who live there from Duke Igthorn, a  bitter ex-knight who wants nothing more than to steal King Gregor's throne with the help of some imbecilic ogres and one mini ogre named Toadwart. From failed catapults to botched magic, the Duke's plans are usually foiled by the Gummis with help from their human friends along with their Gummiberry Juice that gives them a super powered bouncing ability. At other times, his devious plans are useless due to the failings of his dimwitted army of ogres. Due to their failings, the Duke not shy about his harsh feelings and disappoiontment towards them. One of his favorite ways to ridicule is in reference to their lack of intelligence and inability to comprehend the smallest of tasks.

Through many adventures, close calls and finally meeting other Gummis from Gummadoon, the Gummi Bears stay loyal to their family and close friends. Each episode gives us a lesson in morals and values while making it a joy to watch. You don't feel lectured to; you're just having fun.

I highly recommend this animated Disney classic.",1330819200,2,3258,4.736749116607774

I love it, and I convinced my BF to watch it with me and he too thought it was a really great cartoon.  I'm happy to have it in my collection now, because I can put it on when kids come over and its something they've never seen, yet will appeal to a lot of ages.  I feel like cartoons nowadays lack the ""moral of the story"" that cartoons always had when I was growing up - this series is heartfelt, uplifting, funny, really well-drawn, and almost always has a lesson to be learned, that helps children understand right and wrong, the importance of family and friends, etc.  Just typing this makes me want to go pop a disc in and watch an episode or two...

Our world is now much different and media is much more available, but this series is a classic that my children love just as much as I did (and still do).  We sit down every Saturday morning and watch two or three episodes.  There is adventure, and castles, and knights, and ogres, and most importantly a great set of personalities in each of the Gummi Bears.  My boys are 3 & 5 and it is good for both their ages.  The younger one tends to reenact some of the Gummi Bears and their adventures, cultivating his imagination.  The older boy just really loves to watch and figure out what is going to happen.  There is also some Great Gummi inventions that they love to see and we have tried to recreate (also see Rescue Rangers for this kind of thing).

All in all, they not only do they enjoy the shows but we get some quality bonding over something we both share... a love of all things Gummi.",1301443200,,982,4.357142857142857

2647249,5,B000HWZ4RK,"My five year old little princess loves the Gummi Bears! At first, the Ogres scared her a little bit, so we watched the first couple of episodes together. But then she found out that they are really dumb and kind of funny and now she wants to be be Queen of the Ogres! Or one of the Gummi Bears. Or a knight. Or a real princess. Well, for now the Gummi Bears have taken over the top spot in her video list from Tinkerbell ... for now ...
Needless to say that the Gummi bears is one of the least appreciated Disney classics - but they are so funny. There is a certain amount of violence, like in a Bugs Bunny movie, so this might not be the right thing for toddlers. You might want to wait until they are mature enough so that you can discuss with them what they saw. And discuss it, you will, because with 47 episodes, that is a lot of input for those little minds. I made the mistake to let her watch the first disc at once, and she would not quit talking and asking question about what she saw for a whole week ... but it is totally worth it, she enjoys the stories very much.",1300406400,2,1077,4.037383177570093

2647251,5,B000HWZ4RK,"I remember watching Gummi Bears on tv while getting ready for school when I was little (it was already in reruns by then, I was born after it aired the first time but that's beside the point). Needless to say I was excited to see this dvd set. I ignored the more ""grown up"" part of my brain that was pointing out how childish this was and bought the set. I love it. I don't know about everyone else out there, but I know when I'm sick or stressed out or anything like that I just want something that's fun, not too serious and flat out childish even depending on my exact mood. This certainly fits the bill on that for me!

As for the set itself: I find it helpful that the two segments within an episode are separated from each other. It allows you to pick and choose which one you want to watch. This is good because it is inevitable that there is going to be an episode where you liked on segment, but not the other. Having them separate is more convenient.
I wish Disney would release the rest of the show, but I'm very happy to have at least this much of it.",1299456000,,1063,4.110576923076923

Not sure why people are saying there is poor quality. The quality is just fine. It is much better than I was expecting (I had watched a few episodes for free online, and they had scratches, just like an old VHS).

I won't go into reviews of any of the episodes, I haven't watched them all yet, and you can look up individual shows if you really want...

2647277,5,B000HWZ4RK,"Gummi Bears is a great series for both children and those of us who are kids at heart.  It's a cute, funny, clean, and well animated series.  Each episode is fun to watch.  I don't remember watching Gummi Bears while growing up, but I remember knowing it was on tv at the time.  I have been trying to gather a collection of clean cartoons I grew up with for myself and my little boy to watch.  I did some research on YouTube and read reviews and decided to give this series a try since I already have DuckTales, Darkwing Duck, and TaleSpin.  I am not disappointed at all.  I am greatly enjoying these shows and I know my son will too when he is old enough to understand them (he's only 14 months old right now).  Gummi Bears to me feels like the Smurfs for some reason and that's a good thing since my wife and I love the Smurfs.  Gummi Bears is a humorous and clean series in a fantasy setting with castles, wonderful lands, cute magic, cute dragons and funny knights and of course the loveable Gummis!  Oh and the ogres are so nutty! lol  I did notice as some were saying about the picture quality of the first episode or two but it wasn't that bad at all and not worth avoiding this wonderful series for.  The following number of episodes I have watched so far have had good picture quality for a show of it's time and still well worth buying.  I'm watching it on a 42"" Plasma and the quality doesn't bother me one bit.

2647279,1,B000HWZ4RK,"I'm not going to say much about the Gummi Bears that hasn't been said before.  It's a great show and a lot of fun for the kids (and adults too).  However the quality of these DVD's is terrible.  More accurately it is completely unacceptable and if I had known it was this bad, I would never have bought the pack.

The content has been massively compressed in order to squeeze 47 episodes onto 3 discs.  With the low cost of DVD's I think 5 or 6 discs would have been in order.

The compression is far worse than what you might see from your cable or satellite provider.  I have never complained about the compression on a set of DVD's so this should be an indication of how bad it is.  I still don't believe this is from Disney!

Buy this if you're desperate, but if you don't enjoy watching shows with horrible, distracting artifacts in the picture, avoid this at all costs.

2647307,2,B000HWZ4RK,"I have made a similar review for TaleSpin, Volume 1, which I had ordered along with Adventures of the Gummi Bears, Volume 1, under the same order number.  The long and short of it is that the product is great, but the vendor (Supermart) was extremely unprofessional.  I received Adventures of the Gummi Bears a month after I ordered it.  It put a real damper on my Christmas when I couldn't give my sister the gift I had been promising her for weeks!

I had ordered the DVD sets (TaleSpin and Gummi Bears) on December 5th, 2009, expedited shipping.  When December 18th rolled around, and neither product had arrived, I made several inquiries with Amazon and wrote Supermart three emails requesting the products' tracking numbers.  Amazon was great; they were fully prepared to refund me for my purchases.  Supermart, on the other hand, responded two days later to only one of my emails, explaining that they had forgotten to transfer my order number to their database (e.g., they forgot about my order), and that they were postmarking it that day.  On Christmas Eve, I received the TaleSpin DVD set, and Gummi Bears was still missing.

I waited a few days, but Gummi Bears still hadn't arrived.  So I made another round of inquiries, sent another three emails, and searched on the internet for more information on Supermart (the vendor gave Amazon only its email address, and nothing else).  Supermart responded three days later, informing me that they would postmark my purchase within two to six business days (it turned out to be six), and giving me no explanation whatsoever for the holdup in product delivery (in other words, they forgot about my second purchase - I can't think of another reason).  I must have received the product on January 6th (I was out of town when it arrived, and it was postmarked on the 4th), a month after I had ordered it.

Moral of the story:  AVOID THIS VENDOR.  I have read reviews about Supermart from other customers, and some of them were given the same runaround that I was.  In addition, the vendor is not responsive to any inquiries that you make of it, and its responses are short and terse, which leads me to believe that they are automated.  They don't provide Amazon with any contact information, other than their email address (I had to search online to find a phone number), and they don't provide Amazon or the customer with tracking numbers for their products.  The products they sell are very nice, but you might have to go through a lot of hassle to get them.",1263340800,,2511,4.681093394077449

In this DVD comes 42 episodes of these heros, and the way they related to the medieval times.  You get about half of all the episodes on these DVDs.

Except my little sister missed not having anything to watch when she came home from school. We don't really like her watching a lot of the shows on the Disney Channel these days for many reasons, but mostly because they seems aimed at older teens.

But I could sympathize with her, since I remember my after school television shows so fondly, especially the Disney Afternoon. Luckily, Disney is awesome enough to put many of those shows on DVD, so we are watching them together now - that way I can relive my childhood, and she can see something entertaining and generally wholesome.

We just finished watching Gummi Bears, and aside from having the catchiest theme song, it's so much better than I remember! It's got the medieval fantasy thing down, genuinely funny moments, well-developed characters, and the voices are so fantastic.

2647333,5,B000HWZ4RK,"""Adventures of the Gummi Bears"" is about a group of bears (believed to exist only in the imagination) that attempts to right any wrong doings. Most of the episodes are about the gummi bears fighting Duke Igthorn and his band of ogres who attempt to take over Dunwyn castle.  They do so with the help of their human friends Cavin and Cala.  I used to watch this as a kid and loved the humor and storylines of each episode.  Even as an adult, I still find the series very enjoyable.

The DVD set contains 47 episodes.  The footage does not appear to be digitally restored and there are no special features included, but for the price that is being charged, these DVDs are well worth it.",1238371200,2,684,4.396825396825397

The characters are memorable and the theme song sticks in the back of your brain.

My daughter is addicted to the series and always asks when we are going to watch a few episodes.

The show has wholesome traditional family values (such as being honest, getting along with family, dealing with boredom/loneliness, helping others, valuing your history and culture, respecting people who are different) that any culture, race, creed and religion can value.

A must have in any family's DVD library.

Grape juice is now a favourite drink for them, not to mention the singing and bouncing!

Apart from the Gummys, one of the most amusing characters is Toady-Igthorns faithful little ogre. He gets bullied and verbally abused endlessly by his bigger colleagues and boss, but still remains loyal throughout. I always have a good laugh with his witty lines.

I remember so clearly being in school just thinking of going home to watch the Gummi Bears, the cartoons were so creative, funny, and entertaining. I actually liked Gummi Bears more than cartoons like the Transformers, GI Joe, and Masters of the Universe!

The Gummi Bears taught great lessons in very plain and simple terms... through the humor and exploits of each of the 6 characters, Zummi (the Paternal bear), Grammi (the Maternal bear), Gruffi (the responsible & serious bear), Tummi (the all-around helpful bear), Sunni (the young female/teenage bear) and Cubbi (the little boy/adolescent bear).

Through each bear the storytellers taught lessons of how different generations of family members could learn from each other and find ways to show their love and care.

I'm not embarassed to say that I was still watching re-runs of the Gummi Bears when I was in the 9th Grade... and when I saw the DVD set at Best Buy... I didn't hesitate to get it (it was the last one on the shelf so I wasn't the only person happy to see this DVD set!).

I'm looking forward to watching the Gummi Bears with my children one day. Gummi Bears is a shining example of what great Cartoons Disney's animation department is capable of doing.

Now that I am much older, knowing that the juice won't make me bounce like the bears, it was still a great experience to watch them. The DVD set gives you the opportunity to watch the 20-30 minute-parts back to back. The arrival of the DVD coincided with a holiday. I closed myself at home for two days to watch it.

Though the series are twenty years old, I ve seen that none of todays modern ones are comparable. It has a quality of its own. The characters and the stories become more and more exciting as you watch them. You may want your children to get the feeling behind it while they are growing up. As adults, I hope you still have the chance to get it.

Believe it or not, I wanted Mom to prepare me the ""old gummiberry juice"" while watching the DVD and it really made me stronger. It has been a few days now but the music is still on my lips. I am really looking forward to the next volume.",1177372800,,1172,4.064935064935065

The ancient Gummi Bears had fled the land when humans threatened their way of life. A small group of Gummis' were left behind to tend the Gummi home in hopes that the ancient gummi's could return. The tales take you through various adventures the bears face, some are against a tyrant that threatens the glen, while others dive into magical possibilities. Accidental spells, unusual creatures, nifty gadgets of all sorts, and monsters of plenty show up in the day to day lives of these bears making for a great series.

This has been one of my all time favorite animated series when I was growing up. The stories, action, and adventures throughout inspire young adults to become honest and caring individuals. I am delighted that Disney has produced the series in DVD format. If they make the remaining episodes available I will be first in line to purchase them. I hope to see some of the Care Bears, Ducktales,  and My Little Pony series sold on DVD to complete the wonderful 80's style of animation. This is a must buy for all ages.

The animation is superb, the story is wonderful, and some of the characters(Cubbi and Sunni) are cute!

I'm not happy because all they had on the DVD were episiodes of the TV series only no bonus features whatsoever, not even interviews with the original voice actors, I know bill Scott is dead but June Foary is still around along with corey burton.

I had originally been looking for some Care Bears movies for my two daughters (age 2 and 1) because I had remembered enjoying them.  But the second I saw the Gummi Bears DVD, all looking for the Care Bears stopped.  I had always enjoyed the Gummi Bears more than the Care Bears when I was little.  And it appears that my daughters enjoy the Gummi Bears greatly, as does my husband (who didn't see it when it was on TV) with the subtle adult humor of Duke Igthorn.

It's nice to remember a time when Saturday morning cartoons (or afterschool cartoons, whenever you happened to watch) were actually ANIMATED and not just panning still shots with mouths and eyes moving.  I can still watch cartoons from that era (e.g., Beetlejuice, Ghostbusters) and be entertained.  The new stuff is... well... not good.  Anyway, buy this if you like good cartoons.

If you love Disney morning cartoons from thw late 80's and 90's this is the show for you.  In the flavor of the Snorks and Smurfs it's short and sweet.  This set has everything when it comes to episodes.  It doesn't have much in the way of extras.  But for the price it's a steal what you do get.",1173484800,2,348,4.0588235294117645

I do have a problem with the DVD though. There are too many episodes on each disc leading to compression. A dual layered disc can only hold 4 hours of material with good picture quality, if the running time goes over that then picture quality suffers. The first two episodes in particular look pretty bad, in fade ins and outs the picture is actually pixellated. If you do a search for the first episode on youtube, you will actually find a version on youtube with a better picture than on the DVD. Now that is wrong! Splash the cash a bit Disney, if this had been a 4 disc set, there would be no problem! I know i wouldn't mind spending a couple more dollars if it meant better picture quality!",1167523200,36,915,4.319767441860465

While the set is devoid of featurss, it houses 2 years worth of episodes and half the show's run on TV. 47 Episodes total are here in 3 Discs. And who cares if they're not re-mastered or enhanced in any way. These were brought to DVD just as how they were supposed to be enjoyed, just like they were when they aired.

I don't know why the show isn't included on Toon Disney. It's by far one of their best cartoon series, if not the best. It's original and a nice harmless show with adventure and fun for kids. It's sad that I'm 28 and I still find it entertaining lol. I also like that there's a whole season on each disc. Now if only they released the next volume soon, really soon lol. Watching the show now it just seems unappreciated by Disney. I think it's the best series they ever had, it was so good they should make a movie instead of making sequels to each Disney movie that ever came out. I mean we don't need a Sword in the Stone sequel.",1163721600,2,951,4.010526315789473
2647460,5,B000HWZ4RK,"Finally Gummi Bears has come to DVD and they do not disappoint.  Included on Volume 1 is the first three seasons of the show.  There are 47 episodes on the DVD, however it actually comes out to less because they consider the an episode with 2 stories in it that run around 15 minutes to be individual, not one half hour episode.  They do play them as one episode however, with the opening song, two episodes, and then the credits.  Don't get me wrong though it is still a great work on DVD.

I won't review episodes, since all are incredible, for myself the DVDs leave little or no need for improvements.  I don't necessarily need extras as much as other people, so the lack of them doesn't really disappoint me.  Each disc holds around 16 or so episodes and includes a play all feature.  That is plenty for me.  So sit back and enjoy one of the best series Disney has come out with, definitely better than the new series coming out today.  Do yourself a favor and turn off the cable and pop this DVD in instead.",1163548800,6,1012,4.306878306878307

2647463,5,B000HWZ4RK,"For my generation (GEn X) when someone mentions Gummi Bears we don't think of the candy, but we think of Disney's Gummi Bears.  When Saturday Morning Cartoons were must see TV for all children the anchor for many years was The Smurfs and The Gummi Bears.

During that time when Saturday Mornings was a cartoon extravaganza their were many very forgetable shows, but every once in a great while a show would come along that was so original, so unique that you just had to look.  Gummi Bears was one of those shows.  Actually Gummi Bears is just one of several shows that Disney made and is now releasing on DVD.  The others you can buy now Tailspin, Chip & Dale rescue rangers, Ducktales, & to a lesser degree Darkwing Duck are all part of a great run of cartoon shows that Disney made for TV that were excellent.  Gummi Bears was kind of the front runner to the other shows because it was the second Disney TV cartoon show produced.  The first was ""The Wuzzles"" which was the most unique by far.  They only made 13 episodes of The Wuzzles before one of the key voices died, so the show was cancelled.  Gummi Bears came after that and set the standard for quality children's cartoon television for the 80's and 90's.

The central characters are a family of bears living in Gummi Glen, a forest in Europe during the times of knights and princesses.  Each one has a personality so unique that each could have had their good show, but together they fit so well it is a GREAT show.

For any family that has children and want quality entertainment you will not find anything better than this DVD collection.",1161388800,7,1601,4.463917525773196
2647464,5,B000HWZ4RK,"Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears was long overdo for the DVD treatment. Gummi Bears was the first true mega-hit for Disney when it came to syndicated animated shows in the 1980s. By far it was also one of their longest running animated shows during that time period. For some reason I could never understand Gummi Bears just vanished slightly after Disney changed or completely removed it's afternoon cartoon lineup. There were times would appear on either ToonDisney or the Disney Channel, but even those were rare and there was no consistancy. Mostly it was almost as if the show never existed.

As others have said, even twenty years old, this show, through superb quality, excellent voice work by some of the best in the business during the 1980's and early 1990's, has become a timeless classic.

A fantasy tale set in a Kingdom that always seemed so familar but was never one so real that you could pinpoint the area of the world it would be in real life, has such rich details of character and setting. Never did Disney forget who the Gummi Bears were, or what had happened to their society. Always if there were ruins seen one time they would be there a second time and each gave a hint at something that had once been a far greater in size society then even the human kingdom that 'currently' exists in their world.

Perhaps being in the mid 1980's to early 1990's Gummi Bears was partly spared the idea that a show has to be made to sell a toyline based on the show. True other shows in the 1980's were basically made to sell toys, and I think one show during this time was only made because a company had a toy line they wanted to sell. Gummi Bears though, still being on the early end of idea that the show only exists to sell the toys for the show, was allowed rich characterization, and such vast ideas of how their world can look. There didn't seem to be the concern that now seems to fill most animated shows of, being stuck in how something looks by the question ""can we make this easily into a toy"".

For those that remember growing up with this show this timeless classic is one to collect and share with your own children. For those that have never yet had a chance to see this wonderful world the Gummi Bears live in, please give it a chance and I fully believe once you do, you too will understand why for so long fans have been longing to see this day when Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears finally makes it to DVD.",1161388800,17,2449,4.399558498896247
