8460570,1,B0057FGCOQ,"This was shockingly a bad buy. I love blink 182, it's my all time fav band but I already had this DVD and did not care for it so why would I want a second copy? Answer is I don't. This DVD is just blink 182: punk poets but with a deiffernt synopsis and front artwork other than that its the the exact same documentary which I will add is a pointless documentary having not a single interview with the band or members of the band and not a single blink 182 song in it.",1375315200,,467,3.9263157894736844
