I would welcome any of his movies remastered ,as in this collection & wish more of his movies were added to it.  It is good entertainment , the plot is serious & as usual, good wins over the bad. Frog adds the humour to it in his unique way & the songs are good.  I enjoyed the movie & recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Gene Autry. I have been a fan for over 70 years & still enjoy all his movies as much as I did as a child. After all, it is Gene's personality that wins the day. Hope you enjoy it too.",1287014400,,605,3.7109375
8080557,4,B000AYEIKO,"An early black & white movie with both Gene and 'Frog' looking so skinny both are in bad need of a meal.

This western has a plot as thin as broth using cattle and medicine shows as its main thrust. The cattle, having contagious Texas cattle fever, are attempting to cross a country line in spite of a quarantine law being put in existence.  County sheriff Ed Miller and a deputy are later shot from their saddles by the 'black hats' and of natural course Mr. Autry will run for the open office, as no other stalwart citizen is without fear of doing so.

But wait a minute, shortly before being duly elected temporary sheriff, Gene is being accused of shooting and killing the previous sheriff. But the election goes off as scheduled and our man is the winner. From here things move very quickly, as events oft times do in a B western, with our boys last seen heading down the trail in the aforementioned medicine wagon singing one final song, ""...heading back to my guns and guitars"". Well, Gene is riding in the wagon, with Frog running behind trying to catch up.  Yeah, I know I left out a few things, but that is why you want to see this one for yourselves.

If you enjoy the earlier westerns (1930's & 1940's) you will enjoy this 58 minute job, but if you don't care for those movies, or land sakes alive, not even Gene, then you may be adrift with this one.  Myself I enjoy these older westerns made before I hatched (1943) finding them full of great entertainment.

This early Autry venture certainly has a lot of singing and tap dancing along the way; and later some stray bullets, but as always, the 'black' hats give way to the 'white' hats as you just knew they would.

Smooth trails, pards.

Special footnote, Orvon Gene Autry was an American performer who gained fame as The Singing Cowboy on the radio, in movies and on television --- Discovered by film producer Nat Levine in 1934, he and Burnette made their film debut for Mascot Pictures Corp. ""In Old Santa Fe"" as part of a singing cowboy quartet; he was then given the starring role by Levine in 1935 in the 12-part serial ""The Phantom Empire"" --- Shortly thereafter, Mascot was absorbed by the formation of Republic Pictures Corp. and Autry went along to make a further 44 films up to 1940, all B westerns in which he played under his own name, rode his horse Champion, had Burnette as his regular sidekick and had many opportunities to sing in each film --- Autry became the top Western star at the box-office by 1937, reaching his national peak of popularity from 1940 to 1942. His Gene Autry Flying ""A"" Ranch Rodeo show debuted in 1940 --- Gene Autry is the only celebrity to have five stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one in each of the five categories maintained by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce --- Radio, Films, Recordings, Television and Live Theater.

2. Smiley Burnette
Date of Birth: 18 March 1911 - Summum, Illinois
Date of Death: 16 February 1967 - Encino, California

Second special footnote, Lester Alvin (Smiley) Burnette an American singer-songwriter who could play as many as 100 different musical instruments, was a successful comedy actor in Western films over three decades --- The popularity of Burnette's Frog Millhouse character, with his trademark floppy black hat, was such that when Autry left for World War II service he did sidekicks duties with Eddie Dew, Sunset Carson and Bob Livingston, plus nine other films with Roy Rogers. After leaving Republic Pictures in 1944, Burnette became the sidekick to Charles Starrett at Columbia Pictures in the long Durango Kid series. Starrett starred in the series from 1944 until 1952, and that pairing resulted in more than 50 films. After the Starrett series was over, Burnette joined Autry for his final six films, all released by Columbia Pictures in 1953.
