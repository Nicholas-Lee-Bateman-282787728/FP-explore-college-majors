4653587,3,B005CKIE6U,"Half way through this show the Flash software stopped working and insisted that I pay it money. I thought this was a 30 day free trial, but it is not free at all and the videos are not playable on my TV, neo box or Nexus 7. What a joke of a service!",1392681600,,249,3.7169811320754715
4653588,3,B005CKIE6U,"A mercifully-short doccie about one of the weirder* telescopes in use today: two four kilometre vacuum laser tubes that are positioned at right angles to each other to detect the gravity waves postulated by Einstein. The tubes are so sensitive to vibration that in order to eliminate all signal ""noise"" (like, say, a moving car only 500 miles away) the telescope is twinned with an exact copy on the other side of the continent. The scientists don't waste their time with signals that were only detected by one of the telescopes. The experiment uses the same right-angle format as the famous Michelson-Morley experiment that spectacularly failed to discover the ""ether wind"" and as a result set the table for relativity, particle/wave duality, quantum physics et al.

The documentary shows some of the discoveries that they have made, like records of two neutron stars absorbing each other, and the passionate scientists even describe the signals by singing them. The subject, the intelligence going into it, and the discoveries being made, are beyond fascinating.

So why just three stars? Because, like every other damn science documentary made in America, it is written to the level of a standard 7th-grade science ""education."" Is there no market for a science doccie that some people might not understand? The science being done here is marvellous: why not let us hear about some of it, both barrels?

*But not the weirdest telescope, which title might go to the enormous tank of baby oil, buried 2/3 of a mile underneath Japan, detecting neutrinos. That one has done its most significant work so far while pointing straight down. Oh brave new world, that has such telescopes in it!",1391385600,4,1703,5.056939501779359
4653589,4,B005CKIE6U,"Okay, so I remember reading when I was younger about gravity waves.  They seemed to be almost conjecture with research into them just beginning.  So now, in this documentary, I got to see how much progress has been made.  I had no idea that a gravity wave telescope existed.  Really quite fascinating.",1374969600,4,301,4.730769230769231

4653592,3,B005CKIE6U,"Not the worst 21 mins of Amazon Prime viewing I've had. If you want to learn more about gravity wave experiments, research Stanford's Gravity Probe B experiment. It was launched into orbit to look for gravity waves on the shuttle. It uses many of the same principles demonstrated in this video.",1415750400,,294,4.784313725490196
4653593,3,B005CKIE6U,"um, the NSF executive producer for New Dimensions has displayed an unwelcome degree of impatience in covering this LIGO experiment ...

he didn't wait an extra year in order to report on the *RESULTS* of the experiment!

this rush to production defeats the whole point of the NSF (instead of, say, NOVA on PBS) engaging in long-term R&D --the LIGO facilities were ""12 years in the construction"" the narrator is at pains to gravely inspire us with the resources that have been invested in this project (which cost how much BTW? ... just askn' lol).

Amazon should insist that all the documentaries that it purchases include an epilogue with the denouement of the story (the cost of tacking on a 5 minute rostrum isn't really very different than adding the commentary tracks to a DVD; it certainly is not on the same order as the complete digital re-mastering of celluloid).

The incremental editorial effort required for a quickie-style update is something that should be taken as a given for -digital- library titles; otherwise the depreciated value of these orphaned digital assets should be reflected in the rental/purchase prices - which is to say they should be remaindered in the Dollar bin, hmpf!",1413158400,,1202,4.935643564356436

4653598,4,B005CKIE6U,"This is the first program produced by New Dimension Media that I have (knowingly) watched. It seems that their catalog includes a range of topics. Each episode is formatted to fit within a half hour time slot, so the degree of depth is mostly limited by time. No doubt that will be enough to whet your curiosity if the subject interests you.",1399161600,,341,4.516129032258065
4653599,4,B005CKIE6U,I had never heard of this fascinating way to look back at our origins - the beginning of the universe.  It's worth the time it takes to learn a new twist on our world.,1395014400,,167,3.911764705882353

8465526,3,B005CKIE6U,"For when it was first published, it would've been a 4-star rating. Even at only 20 minutes, it would be worth investing $30 just to promote decent documentaries.  However, rating as of today, with the known discoveries by LIGO (black holes coalescing; neutron stars colliding), it gets 3 stars. It most certainly could have been updated with minimal effort, even if only with some news clippings or video from public new sources.",1521417600,,429,4.958333333333333

8465531,4,B005CKIE6U,"There was an article from Nature.com in September 2015 that LIGO had detected gravity waves but apparently it hasn't happened yet.

Anyway, 'Einstein's Messengers' is a cool program that first reminds us that gravity is NOT two objects attracting each other, as we often think, but rather, gravity is the result of an object with mass distorting the space/time fabric around it. We learn that when really massive bodies interact, the resulting space/time distortion spreads out in ""waves"" similar to a pebble dropped in a pond. An article in Space.com from May 2013 states the idea eloquently:

""When two extremely dense objects, such as neutron stars (stars so dense the protons and electrons in their atoms collapse to form neutrons) or black holes, orbit each other in binary pairs, their interactions should create ripples in the fabric of space-time called gravitational waves.""

This is what LIGO is trying to measure, and the program explains how they are going about doing that.

The program was produced in 2007. If you google ""results from LIGO"" you get a Wiki article nicely detailing the history and evolution of the LIGO project, with a notation that the latest sensitivity upgrades ""... will be further enhanced until it reaches design sensitivity around 2021"". The search string also uncovers several links to blogs and articles covering LIGO, such as the aforementioned space.com essay.

Good luck LIGO scientists. Keep it up!",1453420800,,1442,5.145299145299146
