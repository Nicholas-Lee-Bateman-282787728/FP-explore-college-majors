8325779,5,B000UU4LGO,this lady is amazing. her techniques are amazing. i learned this craft years ago but what i learned does not compare to her techniques. major difference in the outcome of the rugs you make. Would love to see her do one for the square rug.  Well worth the price.,1459468800,,261,4.326530612244898

I didn't want to put a lot of money into a rug until I was more experienced, so I made mine with strips of old blue jeans.  I was very pleased with the outcome,  but did make some modifications to make it work.",1372550400,3,365,3.8266666666666667
