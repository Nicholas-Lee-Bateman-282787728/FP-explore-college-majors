We weren't able to watch it with the dvd player because I didn't know different regions couldn't play with certain dvds but is able to watch it on the computer just fine. Thank you!,1360454400,4,300,4.280701754385965
3003132,1,B000XJF07G,I wouldn't even give it 1 star actually. My granddaughter was really disappointed that she couldn't get it to play as she loves Peppa Pig. I would buy all of them for her if they play on they on their dvd player. I'm very disappointed and so is she.,1359590400,,249,4.1020408163265305

My 3 year old daughter LOVES Peppa Pig.  I bought this DVD so she could watch it in the car.  Got it at the house, opened it up, was all set to watch it with her (she was jumping up and down and saying Peppa Pig and snorting like the show), only to see ""unsupported"" on my screen.  Search on google...this will only play in non-regionally coded DVD players.

Since I didn't have one of those, I went to the more extreme method of ripping the DVD using Slysoft's AnyDVD and burning it to a DVD+R I had at home.  Voila!  Now it works in every player but my PS3 (no big deal)

Videos are very cute and my daughter LOVES them!  Very good buy...just took a little longer to get them to work than expected.",1326672000,16,915,4.055865921787709

3003179,2,B000XJF07G,We could not play it on our DVD as it is rated for Region 2 and the US is Region 1 (which I confused with Region 2).  The vendor was willing to take it back but it had to go back to England and would have cost me more to send back than to keep.  Would like it if Amazon would set those DVD's aside in a different location so we don't see them offered in the US.  Quite disappointed with that situation.
