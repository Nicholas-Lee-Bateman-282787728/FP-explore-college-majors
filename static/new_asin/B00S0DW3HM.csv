6938051,5,B00S0DW3HM,"We just watched it this evening, and my husband both really enjoyed it, of course we both really liked Steve McQueen!  We've been watching reruns of Wanted dead or alive, so this came at a good time.",1429574400,2,199,4.378378378378378

6938053,4,B00S0DW3HM,"A pretty  in depth documentary on a rather complex man. Interviews with ex-wives and family, give the film an official documentary feel. But, after viewing this well done documentary, you are more apt to think of Steve McQueen, as an egotistical jerk, rather than the King Of Cool.",1429574400,,281,4.854166666666667
6938054,2,B00S0DW3HM,"Couldn't get past the first 20 minutes of this Film. After the 500th time someone on camera told me how cool Steve McQueen was, to an overly annoying music track under the effusive adjectives, I got tired and clocked out.  Was hoping this would cover his life and his career in a meanful and entertaining way.  But the direction of this thing, the editing, and the need to tell me how awesome he was over, and over, and over, and over again was just undoable.  If this thing got better and actually turned into a real piece on the man and the complicated(ok he was cool I get that part) individual he was I wish they would re-edit and make this watchable.",1429401600,8,655,4.352459016393443
6938055,5,B00S0DW3HM,"I caught this on Spike TV last fall and was happy that SHOUT factory issued it on Blu Ray.  It features great film footage and , high quality McQueen interview footage (what little there is).  McQueen is remembered and praised by an interesting group of talking heads  that for the most part I respect (with the exception of a Sports Illustrated model ).  The documentary moves fast through his life and while not revealing anything terribly new .... it's a very  high quality film about a film  icon.  There is bonus footage as well.. about 15 minutes on his love of cars and another 5 on a long lost film project that turns out Narrator Robert Downey Jr has now optioned.  Mcqueens' ex wives, kids and grandkids are featured in the doc as well as some of his co stars and behind the scenes folks. Of particular interest is Norman Jewison , who directed McQueen in The Cincinnati Kid and The Thomas Crown Affair.  The documentary that you can get for FREE as part of the Bullet film Blu Ray is almost identical to this however so if you have that and aren't a big fan you may save some bucks , but if you are a big fan .... then I recommend this very well done documentary.",1429056000,9,1174,4.348623853211009

6938094,2,B00S0DW3HM,"Firstly it has been a pain to watch because of buffering over and over again despite me having a great network that has no problems with Netflix downloads. It is irritating to see McQueen's son trying to look cool by wearing sunglasses throughout his interviews. Dialogue from actors, actresses and even movie stunt people whom didn't know McQueen and in some cases weren't even born before he died has no value what-so ever.

6938114,3,B00S0DW3HM,"Would have made a great one-hour documentary, with the limited amount of actual Steve McQueen interview footage out there. Gary Oldman is a great actor, but what possible connection does he have to Steve McQueen? Same question for about half the on screen persons interviewed. The worst offender is Marisa Miller, a freaking Sports Illustrated model!! Was she dating the Director or Producer? There's absolutely NO reason for her to be in this.",1440892800,,444,5.095890410958904
6938115,5,B00S0DW3HM,"The same can be said for I Am Steve McQueen. I enjoyed watching it and  he offered a lot of himself but he grew up on the streets at a time when they used such crass phrases as ""yah man"" ""it was a gas"" etc.  Steve used that in his everyday speaking which dated him and also showed his lack of education. For want of the right word or phrase he used ""hippie"" type speaking. This reminded me of the reason I did not like Mark Twain's writing because he wrote it the way they spoke and I do not like it. This is also a one time viewing & the books served me better but that does not take away how well it was done.",1440374400,,611,3.8412698412698414

6938130,2,B00S0DW3HM,"Very little new information, and shallow.  It was very slow paced, and as much as I love Steve McQueen, this doc made me fall asleep.
Chad McQueen sported these obnoxious sunglasses during all of his interview segments which were just annoying.  No, they weren't ""cool""... just annoying.  The interview subjects were sincere, but the pace was just slow, slow, slow.  I love documentaries, and was very disappointed in this one.",1436572800,2,427,5.057142857142857

6938135,5,B00S0DW3HM,A man who really lived! I really enjoyed this documentary of Mr. McQueen's life it was the first time there was any footage of him as Steve  McQueen and not acting with a script. It showed how much he was loved by his family especially his children. I'm glad his son Chad did this. Loved the story how McQueen called his son Chad over and had him jump in on McQueen's lap for  a ride in his race car and took his hands off the wheel for a few seconds when safe. You really see how SM was loved by most who knew him. You see his grand children and how much he loved his family and how much they loved him. He was a success in many ways. Alot due to Neile Adams. She. Loved him..took care of him..gave him the family he so needed and gave him the initial direction which led to his blossoming into what was stored inside him. He really was loved.,1434412800,3,844,4.047904191616767

6938152,5,B00S0DW3HM,"I was a little afraid that this documentary would be a little overboard with clichs and shallow observations about McQueen and how ""cool"" he was. While there is certainly some of that going on (the worst of it being from some model who gets more than enough screen time to talk about how attractive she thinks he was), there is a lot more here than I expected.

Allowing for an error margin of one or two, I believe I have seen every documentary released on the man. You basically get the same story from each, with a few more (or less) details here and there. There are only so many ways to tell the same story. Thankfully, 'I Am Steve McQueen' really seemed to put in effort to give fans something new. There were several pieces of footage I had never seen before, including several segments from and interview with Steve, and an audio clip or two. He has been gone for 35 years now, so any little extra piece of this complex puzzle is rare and goes a long way.

This documentary is visually very appealing, and the overall production is well done. The beginning and end, if I remember correctly, have some annoying music pretending to be ""hard rock"", but that is personal taste, and honestly I didn't notice too much. Its also not all about cars and style. Steve's character is treated with some balance, as there is time devoted to his love for children, as well as his generosity and concern for the boys at the Boy's Republic.

Aside from the big stars who provided input (Pierce Brosnan, Gary Oldman and Randy Couture), it was great to see new interviews with Chad McQueen, Ali McGraw, and Neile Adams.

'I Am Steve McQueen' doesn't cover every single little thing (his conversion towards the end of his life and search for reconciliation are not mentioned, for example), but it isn't meant to, and nor could it be done in the amount of time (I think its a full 1.5 hours).  It is well put together, and would definitely be a fun introduction for newcomers or casual fans. For those who are already familiar with the ins and outs of Steve's complex character, I say the high production value, as well as unseen or long-forgotten footage make it worth the price of admission.

I commend Spike TV for taking on the task of paying some tribute to this well-beloved Hollywood Legend.

-Cheers

PS - The DVD also includes two bonus features. One is primarily about the cars McQueen owned, which includes some footage that was also used in the main feature. I'm unsure about the other, as I didn't have time to get to it yet, but its nice to have extras when the documentary alone delivers plenty.",1432857600,12,2598,4.524520255863539
6938153,4,B00S0DW3HM,In the movie Beautiful girls 1996  Timothy Hutton explains that his family haven't liked anybody since Steve McQueen died. This documentary kind of proves the point by reeling on a bunch of creepy admirers of the late actor who make him look good by contrast. Still the hi def is good so if you can stomach the guff worth watching.,1432512000,,331,4.516666666666667
6938154,3,B00S0DW3HM,"I am a film school grad and I edit documentaries for a living so I love this genre. I found it hard to believe a boring film could be made about McQueen. I could not even finish watching this film.  Just not well crafted and felt like it was ""phoned in"". The film clips are deployed in a ""paint by numbers"" fashion rather than to illustrate, add texture or to enrich the overall story.  Compared to ""Everything or Nothing"" the James Bond doc which is thoroughly entertaining and expertly edited;  apples to apples EoN is head and shoulders above this effort.",1431993600,,558,4.5049504950495045

8696717,5,B00S0DW3HM,"Well, some of you folks just are plain ""sissy punks"" criticizing Steve's son, Chad. The ""Cooler King,"" McQueen adored his children and lavished his love and affection on them. Maybe, his son found it difficult to reveal his eyes, which are the ""windows to the soul."" What a tough act to follow, I can't even imagine being his son. How could you live up to that persona? Furthermore, the actors of today can't even compare to McQueen's masculine presence. They are just plain skinny fairy men, who can't even use what they have to convey what McQueen could do with just one glance. He oozed confidence and sexuality, while having a boy-man charm that you knew he fight hard for you and/or die trying. I think that was portrayed not only in his real life, but captured on film and in bios, and I don't appreciate that people have to find fault with his child. Furthermore, if you want to know the real McQueen get the ""Wanted the Dead or Alive,"" series, and watch it with your children. It has lots of tough sentimental action and morals too. I sent Steve McQueen a letter in the early sixties and I have an autographed picture signed by the man. He drove by me in 1976 while I was hitchhiking in Malibu and despite his notorious womanizing, he didn't perve or be anything less than a gentleman, in fact he mouthed I was ""jailbait,"" and did not stop. To me, he is a person, that made it despite the odds and cards stacked against him. Watch ""The Sand Pebbles,"" if you can't see the strength of character in this man, as well as his loyalty to his friends, on and off screen. That's the McQueen you need to know, not some fabricated deduction of your ideals, fantasies, jealousies, and criticisms. He had just about everything any All American Male could want. He was a biker, hippie, cowboy, parent and husband, tough guy, happy-go-lucky sensitive charmer that died way too young and experienced his life to its fullest capacity. Can you say you've done that?",1482019200,,1957,4.5625
