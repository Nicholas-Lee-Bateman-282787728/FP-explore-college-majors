I purcased this collection some years ago directly from MILL CREEK on a (Believe It Or Not) $10. for ANY 50 pack!  I also own the 250 Pack Western Collection that Most of the Mill Creek Western Packs are made from.  Whatever Collection you own, I can only hope that you enjoy it as much as we do!  The movies vary in quality, acting ability, and that really does not matter real! y.  I enjoy watching them ALL, just as they are.  I am looking forward to getting ""Cowboys and Bandits"" Soon!  I am glad that AMAZON carries these Fabulous Collections.  By the way, None of these movies are included in the Giant WESTERN 250 Collection.

Western movies were very popular in theaters from the 1930s to the 1940s, and on television in the 1950s and 1960s. Most people over fifty remember them. Younger people may also find them entertaining and educational. They had a message: those who do right win in the end. These movies defended small ranchers against the big landowners who wanted their lands. Others defended people against criminal gangs with ""collective security"". The right to keep and bear arms was well-recognized. Small movie studios were threatened by big movie studios with their cartel of theaters. Was it changing tastes or economics that caused their decline? Few people under fifty have ever seen horses used to work the land. Many were set in modern times and showed telephones, radios, and automobiles.

The newer westerns in the 1950s changed to personal conflicts from property conflicts. ""High Noon"" was an example of personal conflicts (with a hint of business conflicts). One movie noted how an increase in settlers disadvantaged cattle men since they could no longer graze their cattle on publicly owned range land. Government land were given to homesteaders, people who would earn the land by working and developing it. Laura Ingalls Wilder's books told about homesteading on the prairie and pioneer life on the frontier. Building a railroad into Texas ended the long cattle drives to the cow towns of Kansas. Store owners did more business with 500 families living year around than from 1,000 transient cowboys.

These movies were popular before big corporations began to put small owner-operated stores and farms out of business. One way was to cut off small business owners from wholesale distributors. If banks ""red-lined"" small businesses they could not get the loans needed for running their business. There were no government loans for farmers and ranchers then. Many of these films were produced by small studios who operated on a low budget. Later they were shown on television during the 1950s to fill up their broadcast schedule (the way some older TV shows are recycled today).

These western films had very little padding and there is more action than in some longer big studio productions. Some have songs and dances for entertainment. The stars are: Roy Rogers, Johnny Mack Brown, Buster Crabbe, James Newill, George O'Brien, Tex Ritter, Bob Steele and many others who are little remembered today. Some were real cowboys (Tim McCoy, Hoot Gibson) or rodeo riders (Ken Maynard). The formula of the ""Three Mesquiteers"" seems to have inspired the ""Range Busters"" and the ""Rough Riders"" (they were undercover investigators who fought gangs of criminals). The titles on each of the twelve single-sided DVDs follow.

Unlike previous MCE and TREELINE boxes which consisted of flip-discs, their movies are now issued on single-side, dual layer DVDs. Transfer quality of these unrestored films depends entirely on source material. None are pristine studio quality but rarely are they so bad as to be unviewable. Certainly, the price is right for such a large offering of less-common works.

There's genuine obscurities among these vintage 1930s and 40s programmers as well as old faves like Bob Steele, Harry Carey, the Texas Rangers, Crash Corrigan, Tex Ritter, Hoot Gibson and Roy Rogers.
