2168729,4,B00065EAZK,"I bought this DVD after my 20 month old loved the other ""Nursery Rhymes"" dvd from Baby Genius. His reaction to this one was the same. He loves it so much that he wants to play this atleast 3 times every day. Personally I didn't think the video was that great and music for some was quite different to the audio cds that I have. But my son enjoys it.

Overall I think its a great value. I bought it from walmart for under $7 and I think its unbeatable. Especially comparing it with Baby Einstein DVDs.",1143072000,2,500,4.154639175257732
2168730,1,B00065EAZK,"I got this video from a friend, and was hopeful that my kids would love it, as they love to sing along to children's songs.  I put in on a few times, but it didn't hold their attention.  The bonus music cd is nice, but the video could be better.",1140134400,18,245,3.88
2168731,5,B00065EAZK,"We bought this video for our 18 month old.  She loves it!  She's learning to sing along.  She loves to watch the children playing on the video, she has a smile the whole time.  The songs are ones I remember growing up with so I can sing along with her.  They aren't annoying like some children's CDs can be so our family enjoys singing in the car with her.  I highly recommend this CD/DVD for toddlers.",1137196800,,402,4.223684210526316
2168732,5,B00065EAZK,"Our daughter absolutely loves this DVD and we also have the CD in the car.  She is only 18 months old and knows most of the songs and can relate to real objects as well. (example - bus, muffin, boat, etc.)  Very educational and great for kids.  I must add that she hasn't been interested in the other Baby Genius videos we got her that don't have songs or talking in them.",1129852800,7,372,4.138888888888889
2168733,4,B00065EAZK,My Son is 20 months and he loves this dvd. he watches is 2-3 times before he goes to sleep. Sometimes if i needed few min break like taking shower and taking out the trash. he'll keep still and watch without moving an inch from his seat. The only thing is it's only few songs on a 33 min dvd. i wish there's more but i also have the nursery rhymes baby genius and he likes it too.,1128038400,3,380,3.8846153846153846

2168735,5,B00065EAZK,My 12 month old HATES the car.  She has hated it since day 1.  We have a DVD player in the car and play the Baby Einstein videos for her.  She will tolerate them for a little while. She received the BG video as a birthday gift.  She LOVES it. She has watched it over and over again.  She has never been so quiet in the car.  This has totally saved me! I can't wait to get more.  I highly recommend this DVD!,1124236800,10,407,3.8313253012048194

2168748,5,B00065EAZK,My 1 & 3 year old LOVE these. Cute classic kid's songs with live action videos of kids running around and playing. I don't really understand the appeal but I don't question something that occupies them while I make dinner :),1470009600,,224,4.487804878048781
2168749,3,B00065EAZK,"My son likes this DVD, unfortunately much of the singing is out of tune (kids and adults) and is not in sync with the kids mouths in some places.  If you like to watch with your kids, this may be irritating.",1467590400,,207,4.048780487804878

2168770,4,B00065EAZK,"My kid was minorly distracted by this.  The muffin man was awesome.  I felt kinda bad for him because it looked so awkward for him to do the scenes, but he powered through it and I get a kick out of his performance.  This wasn't for me though, it was for my kid and she was pretty indifferent to the muffin man.  I'll show it to her again when she's old enough to appreciate it.

As a baby distraction, the Baby Einstein series worked quite a bit better. If you can get this on the cheap it wouldn't be horrible to add it to the distraction rotation.

Would have only given it 3 stars, but it has a 'Repeat Play' function that some baby video's lack that's worth a star.",1458691200,,670,4.115384615384615

I was first introduced to Baby Genius when our kids were very small, they are toddlers now and still enjoy ""Favorite Children's Song"".

This DVD utilized animation with actual situation that are recognizable to children.  They are not only enjoying a DVD but learning at the same time.  It's fantastic.

I recommend this DVD to all of my friends and family with small children!",1454544000,6,562,4.842105263157895

2168780,5,B00065EAZK,"I got this for my 18-month-old granddaughter for Christmas. Right from her first viewing, she was hooked! She has sat and watched it quietly for 20 minutes at a pop, which any parent/grandparent can tell you is unusual. Toddlers of that age are busy, busy, busy, flitting from one activity to the next. But she will sit mesmerized while watching the video, which shows young children engaged in various activities, such as singing, dancing, doing cartwheels,marching, and playing on playgrounds. The songs are instantly recognizable, such as Pop Goes The Weasel, Do You Know The Muffin Man?, Yankee Doodle, and The Wheels On The Bus. These are classics for a reason; they're catchy and singable.

But I believe the most compelling reason that it has made such a hit with her is that the filming is done in relatively short clips, for the most part. The camera moves from subject to subject, staying around 3 seconds or so. This creates less potential for boredom for toddlers. Plus, there is a variety of bright colors that also keep attention. There are some cartoon characters, adorable animals that drop in throughout, including one sketch of DJ the dinosaur conducting some of the others, while singing clever words to Mozart's ""Eine Kleine Nachtmusik,"" so that your toddler even gets a smattering of things classical.

It's clear that the producer of this video knew what toddlers like, and what will stimulate toddler thought processes. I'm sure my granddaughter will be watching this over and over for a very long time.",1451520000,4,1526,4.95703125

Now even he watches other shows, this is still among his favorites.

2168788,3,B00065EAZK,I bought this thinking it was new from Baby Genius. Well the release date is deceiving. This is the same as the Favorite Songs DVD which we already owned. Now I am stuck with 2 DVDs with the exact same music (albeit minus 2 songs from the first DVD). I am very upset at this.

For example they sing: 'She's Coming Around the Mountain' - But shows a train.....probably should of used horses or a stage coach at least.

I know, they had to add stuff to make most of these songs longer, kid friendly and what have you. Oh well the odd ball words they added make the wife and I laugh.",1378771200,,458,4.313953488372093

I would say that she likes this one, but not as much. I think it skews slightly older than the nursery rhymes so she might grow into this one down the line. But nicely made with classic songs (with the exception of the first song, ""Wheels on the Bus."" This one is sung by someone who is completely tone deaf and I can't take it! But all of the others are really well made. No idea what happened with that song.)",1364947200,,551,4.257142857142857

2168832,1,B00065EAZK,"Our daughter soon lost interest in most of the songs compared to Baby Signing Time DVD.  Of course music DVD and sign language DVD are different, but this product is such a scamped work that has randomly shot play scenes of the same children (overly caucasian) and repetitious animations that do not even match the lyrics. It's annoying that they feature same girls and boys that it makes me think they must be the sponcers' children. Many of the songs are not really for kids, and are sang by so-so singers. I find it nothing attractive about this product. I recommend Baby Signing Time DVDs (even if you are not into baby sign language) for their quality and baby-friendly, interactive original songs.",1349913600,25,703,4.762295081967213

He will get excited when he hears them on other programs or when we sing them.
