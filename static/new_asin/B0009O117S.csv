It begins in 1950 Chicago. A crippled man talks to a young boy. Its Christmastime, we see people on the street. A woman sings while she plays the piano in a bar. Nicks mother Nellie works as a waitress, she smiles as she serves customers. The cook is a former boxer. Merry Christmas. Why are some people real nice? Nick and his mom have surprise visitors. Its like having a family. They talk about their pasts. This is not a good place for a young boy (West Madison Street). Years later Nick Romano is grown. He had a fight, he got a challenge. He studied the piano and shouldnt risk his hands, says Nellie. He cant work after school because he must practice the piano. The judge talks to Flora, she needs a fix now. Nellie works as a B-girl.

She meets a man there. At home Nick gets a telephone call in the hall. George meets him as he leaves. Nick is ambushed! The police take them all in. Franny goes to a flophouse to find Judge Sullivan. A man pays Nicks fine (he knew his father). Nick auditions for an important man, a lawyer. He will get Nick an audition for the Conservatory. The story continues with more information about the characters. We learn about Louies real business! [Does a smiling stranger always mean well?] Nick returns home and finds a surprise! Hes got to grow up sometimes says Louie. Nellie orders him away. Dont get me mad he replies. Nellie talks about her past to Nick. She feels bad and wants a sweet drink. Nick rejects the visitors who want to help him.

The next day Nellie goes to see Louie for a fix! Were not finished he says. Back at home Nellie cooks her powder. Nicky discovers her drug use! He runs off and borrows a pistol. [This tells about the right to keep and bear arms in Chicago then.] Nick visits Louie and makes a threat, but is put in the back room! Nellie and the Judge visit Louie to find Nick. They leave. Flora tells them what happened. The Judge attacks Louie, who shoots him! Its too late he says, and tells Nick to go away before the police come. The Judge didn't leave a big estate. Nellie will take the cure and finish it. Nick meets his girlfriend. A better future? We hope so.

This monochrome movie uses Skid Row in Chicago as the background. Was it prettied up? Could a drug dealer operate without contacts and protection? Beware of any friendly stranger  who offers free samples, even if he is a friend from school or the neighborhood. Karen Ann Quinlan took a pill offered by someone at a party, then spent the rest of her short life in a coma. Or watch the movie D. O. A. for an example why you should never let your drink leave your hand.",1449100800,,2647,4.328629032258065

8064333,5,B0009O117S,It's an old black and white movie so it wasn't perfect (not the seller's fault) but the movie works fine.  I was grateful to find a copy.  I always loved the movie and hadn't seen it in years.,1314316800,5,192,4.026315789473684
8064334,5,B0009O117S,"Nick Romano's father is killed in the electric chair and his mother and surrogate family band together to ATTEMPT to take care of the young lad who is a sweetheart.  I say ""ATTEMPT"" because as the plot moves along, it becomes clear the adults cannot even care for themselves, let alone care for the young Nickie Romano Jr.  The movie opens with young Nickie walking West Madison Street in Chicago distributing homemade Christmas cards to the main players in this graphically real flick. What a delight as a young boy.  (See also ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" starring Frank Sinatra.)  Shelley Winters is great as Nickie's Mom, tormented by her way of life and her desire to care for her son.  Burl Ives is fantastic as an old alcoholic lawyer/""Judge"" in love with Shelley Winter's character, Nellie.  Ricardo Montalbon, young and debonair is the villain and is cool, suave and debonair and hooks Nellie and others on heroine.  James Darren is the teenage Nickie, with a 28 inch waist, oh to be young again!  ;-)~  !  Jean Seberg is an upclass uptown girl living in a penthouse with her father and in love with Nickie.  Her character is a little too gushy and probably the only one not aging well with this flick from 1960, but, that's a minor irritant. The price of admission is worth it for this flick just to see ELLA FITZGERALD sing and play piano.....WOW!  There is a character who has lost his legs up to the knees and rides around on a little skateboard he pushes with his arms.  He sells newspapers from a little shed and is probably, ironically, the happiest character in the story.  The characters are well developed, and since this is also taken from a William Motley book, I imagine the characters are even developed further in the book. Read the reviews of Willard Motley's book ""Knock on any Door"" as well:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knock-on-Any-Door/dp/0875805434/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knock on Any Door</a>",1209168000,21,1975,4.9817073170731705
8064335,5,B0009O117S,"This is a great movie.  Shelly Winters, Burl Ives and James Darren are all well cast.  Jean Seberg is good as James Darren's love interest.  Ella Fitzgerald does well in her role as the drug addicted singer and Ricardo Montalban is deliciously rotten as Louie the pusher.  Fans of the Young and The Restless will recognize Jeanne Cooper as Fran the street walker.  Please release to DVD perhaps in the wide screen format.",1207353600,17,421,4.712328767123288
