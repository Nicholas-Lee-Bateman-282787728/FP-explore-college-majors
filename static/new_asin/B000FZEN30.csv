8127637,5,B000FZEN30,My special needs granddaughter was interested in listening to this CD,1423785600,,69,5.363636363636363
8127638,4,B000FZEN30,"This DVD uses signs, gestures and imitation skills to introduce children with learning disabilities to the art of signing with music.  A Board Certified Music Therapist demonstrates each sign to be used, then sings the song while signing.  This would be a great DVD for educators and childcare providers to introduce themselves to the importance of signing, so they can later sing and sign with the children left in their care.",1311984000,,427,5.0
8127639,1,B000FZEN30,This movie is lying a bit with the title...Yes they are signing songs...but the signs she uses are not true ASL signs. If youare looking to teach your children sign language this is not the movie for you!  I am VERY DISAPOINTED WITH THIS!,1224288000,,238,4.409090909090909
8127640,1,B000FZEN30,Video did not contain many signs.  My child did not like it.  It did not hold his attention.  I would not recommend it.,1217894400,,119,4.086956521739131
8127641,1,B000FZEN30,"Dont buy this it is very boring. and not woth the time or money. Unless you want to here for the billionth time why signing is good. However, if you are planing to buy a sign video you most likely already know that.",1191283200,,215,4.023255813953488
8127642,5,B000FZEN30,"Early Childhood Instructors have ""Signing Songs"" DVD in their check out  library. I checked it out and wound up buying it. It is up beat and my kids are learning along with me. Early childhood instructors also told me that if you don't learn another language (Spanish, or sign language) at an early age it becomes harder to learn when you are older. Also the part of the brain that is stimulated when you learn languages is the part of the brain that math skills are learned- so that part of the brain is stimulated! Great news! I don't feel bad about having them watch this video since it is educational. We enjoy this one!",1179532800,,624,4.426086956521739
8127643,2,B000FZEN30,"I was eager to learn about this video early in the fall.  My children received the DVD as a Christmas gift.  After listening to the introduction I was elated, I agree with everything she says, (it's all in the editor's note on the product).  Then the songs started and she showed the gestures for the songs.  My goodness, I was vastly disappointed with the bare minimum of what would be signs.  There are seven songs on the video and I think there might be an average of three signs per song.  Twinkle Twinkle Little Star has two signs that she shows in the introduction, one the opening and closing of the hands (from a fist to an open 5 hand) then she does shoe the sign for star, but in the song portion only uses the first sign, for the whole song.

I know children are far more capable than the signs used in the video.  I have children with special needs and at 2 years of age they knew more than 70 signs, at 2 1/2 more than 115.  Of those signs many are in classic children's song including Twinkle Twinkle.

The only reason the video is not a 1 rating is because it did in fact hold my childrens' attention, even though they were signing more at home watching the video than there were signs in the movie.  To boot they were a bit confused as to why the lady on the video wasn't signing as much as they were.",1169251200,8,1317,4.186507936507937
