4390673,4,B004J7CPHG,"I did order A Midsummer Night;s Dream Live in Maastricht for a total amount of almost $40.  The seller was Ivan Pinto Castro.  Researching amazon.com,I found the same Dvd listed for close to $20.00 . I do not understand the difference in pricing.  This DVD is one of the best ones I have bought.
The only thing I do not like on most of Andre Rieu DVDs is the constant repetition of songs. With so much beautiful music and songs, this should not  happen as often as it does.",1338768000,,473,4.280898876404494
4390674,5,B004J7CPHG,"I JUST RECEIVED THIS DVD.  AS USUAL HE PLAYS TO HIS AUDIENCE. IN DOING SO HE HAD TALENT FROM MANY PLACES IN THE WORLD, AS WELL AS HIS USUAL ORCHESTRA.  THERE IS NO OTHER SHOW THAT COMPARES TO THIS ONE.  I RECOMMEND THAT YOU PURCHASE THIS DVD.  THE PHOTOGRAPHY IS SURPURB.  THE AUDIO IS EXCELLENT.

4390675,5,B004J7CPHG,"My wife and I attend this concert series last summer.  We saw six concerts from our hotel room overlooking the Vitroff, two on the main square and one at the MECC.  It had been 30 years since we were last in Europe and this was our first time Holland.  What an experience!!  This concert was more like a pep rally for the Dutch national football (soccer) team and Andre had whipped the audience into a frenzy.  The DVD was filmed two days before the finals between Holland and Spain and it does a very good job of capturing the level of excitement.  The  concert itself was up  to Andre's high standard.  My favorite part is when Carmen came onto the stage wearing the form fitting RED dress for her rendition of ""Habenera"".  I swear that I heard some heart pacemakers going into overload.  I got slugged in the arm and was ""fined"" 300 Euros in an Amsterdam Quilt shop the next week by my wife for my comments concerning Carmen's curvy figure.  It was worth it!!  This is my FAVORITE DVD (I have 25) and is a definite BUY!",1314835200,7,1022,4.343915343915344
4390676,5,B004J7CPHG,"I've collected several of Andre Rieu's concert DVDs since first hearing the music via an e-mail forward...this DVD has been the best of the bunch...the singing of Ave Maria by Kimmee from South Africa is truly beautiful.  She definitely makes the song a prayer, you must hear it.  And the childrens groups performing both ""our"" music and their native African music, definitely makes your body move, some move more than others, but everyone seems to get into the beat!  Then there's DJ Otzi, who seems to be a European crowd pleaser, and the audience participation proves it...they loved his performance...so did I  But, it is true that different folks like different things, and music is no exception.  There always seems to be something in every Andre Rieu concert to speak to the different music tastes.  I hope you enjoy all of it...I sure did!",1314230400,12,847,4.847222222222222

4390703,5,B004J7CPHG,We simply love all of Andre Rieu's videos.  Never have been disappointed in any of them and wish he'd offer a lot more from his various tours.  Have often purchased extra copies of his DVD's to give to friends.  Most of them have never heard Andre Rieu and they all have come back and told us how much they have enjoyed them.  A good way to introduce Andre Rieu's music to others.,1391299200,,380,4.236111111111111
