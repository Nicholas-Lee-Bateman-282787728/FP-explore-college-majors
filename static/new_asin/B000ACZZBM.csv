8077841,4,B000ACZZBM,"They did a great job at restoring some of the old films. Nine different movies are included on the disk. I got this for if nothing else the chance to see ""Duck and Cover"" again. I remember seeing that movie when I was in grade school in the early/mid 1960's. Now seeing it as an adult, I'm surprised that the film was almost 10 years old when I saw it! I grew up in those 'home shelter- civilian defense' days. I remember my mom sending me and my sister to the local, Redlands California, Police department to pick up all the handouts about making your own home shelter. WOW, what a difference 40 years made! For a historical, and often hysterical, look at all the things we DIDN'T know, watch this. I'd say rent it over buying but it's hard to come by which is why I went ahead and bought mine!",1243814400,,795,4.2368421052631575
