3136854,5,B00150N8EY,"I was bored and flipping through cable channels the other night when I came across this delightful gem of a movie. Even though it is listed as a Christian romance, the religious touch is very light and the romance is enjoyable. Although this appears to be a low budget movie (no big name actors, etc.), it is still a good movie to watch, own or rent.",1245196800,2,350,4.318181818181818
3136855,5,B00150N8EY,interesting film. Man seems to be a beast; but is misunderstood. Girl falls in love with him and they live happy ever after.,1234137600,,124,4.434782608695652
3136856,1,B00150N8EY,"I am happy to see that this video has been discontinued.  ""A Christian Romance"" it is NOT! This is simply the classic romance story with a few ""God wants you to be happy"" phrases thrown in. But God wants us to glorify him, which is what really makes us happy.  In the movie, there is no mention of living for Christ, indeed no mention of Christ, just a God who could be anyone/anything.
Please do NOT buy this video wherever you might be able to find it.  This video does not show what constitutes being a Christian.  Show video makers that you want real Christian stories, not fake ones.",1227744000,11,588,4.36697247706422

3136858,5,B00150N8EY,"This movie is a very enjoyable and likeable romance.  It is a present-day telling of Beauty in the Beast and I think every girl nowadays will commiserate with the working-girl portrayal of Belle.  It is very clean, suitable for all ages, and makes for a nice evening.  The acting is rather amateurish and the lines delivered too quickly at times, sometimes in acting things have to be spoken and enunciated more deliberately than in everyday speech.  However, the movie is a pleasant one and I think anyone will enjoy it.  It actually inspired me to call my gruffly old boss and say ""Hey!""  It makes for a great girl's night out!",1214524800,6,629,4.621621621621622

3136942,3,B00150N8EY,"It is a sweet story, although not very believable. The actor who played the beast overdid it a lot, and I don't think that anyone who behaved that badly would be able to keep a single employee.  Not even the beast in the original beauty and the beast story behaved that abominably.  I don't know what the director or the actor was thinking.  .",1522800000,,343,4.328125

3136972,4,B00150N8EY,"Good Christian romance.  Slow start and apparent overacting at the beginning are the only reasons I give this 4 stars rather than 5.  The movie steadily improves throughout with a wonderful ending.  I say ""apparent"" overacting because the story is trying to track the classic fairy tale, which requires portraying behavior that is so extreme that it equals the physical beastliness of the fairy tale's Beast.",1517270400,4,408,5.151515151515151

It seems like now days the movie makers think its not a romance movie if it doesn't show the sex scenes. It is much more romantic without showing everything.",1516060800,,377,4.1506849315068495

3137122,2,B00150N8EY,"What type of Christian movie shows a woman slap a man? If they left out the physical abuse and the religion it would have been a much better movie. The religious aspects were corny, forced and made my 4 star go down.",1499817600,,216,4.166666666666667
3137123,5,B00150N8EY,Great movie!  Would have liked to have seen a little more with the ending though.,1499385600,,81,4.4
3137124,5,B00150N8EY,"Yes, as other reviewers have mentioned,  the acting is sub-par... in the beginning. After a while, though, the characters become more comfortable with their on-screen personas and the stiltedness eases. Stephanie Wood, who plays Belle, is excellent from the beginning. She really is the star of this production.
Regarding the movie, though, I thought the interpretation was excellent! Very well done transition to a modern day scenario. It IS written from a Christian perspective, so that might put people off who do not follow that particular faith, but there's no Bible punching in this movie. They do discuss death and loss from a Christian perspective, but in such a way that it is a normal discussion between a believer and a non-believer. (The cheesy ""bad things happen to good people"" should never have been allowed into the final copy, though. Fire the editor! LOL)
As in the original novel, Belle goes to the ""Beast"" aka Eric Landry, to plead for her father and agrees to work for Eric to pay off her father's debt. Her sweet nature and caring personality seep into the cracks in Eric's hard heart and make him aware that he cannot turn his back on the world. The ""rampaging villagers"" ended up being Belle's suitor, Craig (or Greg, I wasn't sure!) who, rejected by her, causes trouble for Eric to get her to leave him. This succeeds in driving Belle away, but not, as he hoped, into Craig's arms. I won't give away the plot by telling you what he does or how it is all resolved, but it does follow the original novel fairly faithfully.
Overall, I chose this as I needed a feel good movie to watch as I was doing manual labor (stuffing goodie bags) and I thoroughly enjoyed it once I got past the very still first half hour. Recommended, especially for families of younger children, Christian families of all ages, and anyone who still believes in the magic of true love!",1498176000,4,1880,4.696969696969697

3137126,4,B00150N8EY,Enjoyable and has great hope factor. This movie would have been better if the main characters had actually went to church or studied the Bible together.

Given a higher budget - a few different actors, particularly the wanna be boyfriend, it could have been sweeter.  I felt the two main characters did a pretty good job, the woman who played Belle, did a nice job in this movie. She was definitely the best actor and I would watch her in other movies.

It just goes to show you a woman can be beautiful without ducklipping every line and running around naked. Big personal pet peeve btw.

The only thing I wish was during the scene with Eric and Belle talking about his wife. I wished she had said God does not kill people the devil does. It is a common misnomer.",1487203200,,504,4.315789473684211

God's wants to transform us into Christ-like character and while happiness often comes as a result of pursuing holiness,  seeking happiness in the absence of obedience to God does not make us ""good people"" and certainly does not gain us entry into heaven.  There is no mention of Jesus or the Gospel of salvation at all in this movie and there is no illustration of the disciplines of faith other than one scene when Belle is shown reading the Bible.  There is false characterization of churches as being the main source of negativity (""he's a beast, everyone at church says so"").  The main male character who supposedly had his heart transformed by God never even opened the Bible.  This movie had the opportunity to offer true hope to people who are seeking joy and meaning but instead if only offered a false doctrine.  How disappointing.",1484870400,3,954,4.704819277108434

3137621,1,B00150N8EY,"I remember watching this movie when it came out..saw it and hate it. The acting was sooo bad, you rolled your eyes so many times you may have a seizure.

I swore never to see it again..but I was bored and saw it and I could not remember much about it ( my brain protecting itself blocked it out) so I watched it again and it is all coming back. The flash backs for horrible plot, horrible acting, horrible everything!

Belle the good for everything, good daughter, good sister, good christian person who thinks good about everybody. Goes to school, goes to work, cooks, cleans, watches the siblings and also works longs hours with the ""beast""

The beast..rich guy who loses his wife like 10 years ago..now he yells at everybody, his poor maid just sort of grew deaf to all his nasty behavior. Then here comes belle, talking about God and goodness. All of the sudden he sees the light ( cue hallelujah) but some desperate boy with a crush..just ups a calls a power company and uses his name to get belle's dad in trouble.

This is where the bad acting really starts...she runs and tells him off and the beast is devastated.etc etc etc

Just really bad acting, abusive, lying, bad bad. I would recommend avoiding this train wreck unless you are into sappy romantic movies and have 20 cats..you won't like it.",1472860800,5,1306,4.516949152542373

It is sweet and a decent option if you've already binge watched all you favorite shows and there's nothing on tv. It pretty much ends there though. Not sure if it was the acting, the writing or the low budget camera work a combination of the all 3, but I can't say that it was a GOOD movie, it was just ok.

3137861,1,B00150N8EY,I have to agree with other reviewers about the bad acting. It's pretty bad. How bad? So bad.,1459814400,3,92,4.166666666666667
3137862,1,B00150N8EY,"This is a feel-good movie soured by 1940s sexual stereotypes. The hero of the story, Belle, turns around the life of a hate-filled man (""the Beast"") by showering him with sympathy and understanding. That's about the only good thing to say about this movie. Unfortunately, Belle exists in this movie only to serve men, and this movie basically says that is the role of a good woman.

We learn at the beginning of the movie that Belle began serving her father when her mother (his wife) dies. She drops out of college in California, returns home, and helps with the raising of her younger siblings and working part-time. Then, to save her hapless father from being fired from him job, she takes another job as an indentured servant to ""the Beast,"" a wealthy man whose mission in life early in the movie is to make people unhappy.

Since Belle has a good heart, she showers the Beast with kindness and respect even though he treats her like dirt, criticizing her and requiring her to perform menial jobs so he doesn't have her father fired from his job. Later, we learn the Beast is so hate-filled because he lost his wife in an automobile accident.

Belle then pours on more kindness and they fall in love. The Beast then rescues her from what promised to be a dead-end, poverty-ridden life and takes care of her in luxury and style. Ah, yes, women can't survive without a rich and powerful knight to rescue them.

A weird side story of this movie is a stalker-like friend of a friend who professes his enduring love for Belle and insists she eventually will grow to love him. Instead of putting great distance between her and this creepy guy, she is constantly nice to him -- only until she learns she has his father fired by making a fake phone call to his company. This subplot reminds us, the viewer, how it is best for women to be nice to men even when they are possessive stalkers.

As other reviewers also point out, the acting in this movie is of the high-school-stage caliber. If the acting were more honest and heart-felt and the story more realistic, I would have given this movie 2 stars instead of the one.",1459382400,9,2117,4.531413612565445

It was also really disturbing how Belle felt the need to be ""nice"" to a man who was legit stalking her and creepy intense during their interactions. Let's not confuse true Christian virtue and kindness with the inability of a grown woman to assert her boundaries. Kind of unhealthy. Overall, this movie was a real dud in my opinion.

It is obvious this was low budget.  You can usually tell when a lot of money was spent on a movie and this definitely was not one of them. However, despite that, it was a great movie.  First off, I love the character of Eric Landry and how he transforms during the course of the movie.  He was almost impossible not to love by the end of the movie.  The only thing that really bugged me was the character Craig.  I did not like him at all...I thought he was annoying and stalkerish.  I realize he played a part in the plot though, so although he annoyed me, he did add to the plot development.  I liked that this was a clean movie, but yet romantic and sweet.

3138041,4,B00150N8EY,"I love the plot of this movie. Then again I can't resist any Beauty and the Beast story. I love them all! It is my favorite fairy tale. Why? Because it is the most unrealistic fairy tale yet the only fairy tale I wish would be true. Think about it, Cinderella gets a prince because of her outer beauty, Rapunzel gets a prince by having beautiful hair, even in Disney movies, Ariel acts like a brat to get what she wants, Tiana and Naveen work hard to please each other, etc. These are fairly realistic situations. How many times does someone ""Fall in Love"" with someone because he/she is hot? Or tries too hard to make somebody happy? Or demand what they want? Let's face it, assuming you have a normal and non-abusive family, your parents are the only ones who will love you even when you do something wrong. No one else. Yet Beauty and the Beast demonstrates the impossible: Unconditional love. Love that lasts even while a person is cruel, mean, bitter, or beastly. I can guarantee that a mother will love her son while he's in prison, but the wife will be quick to want a divorce. If Belle were real, she would not do that. She would be the rare or unrealistic wife that stays. In fact, the Beauty and the Beast stories that I find to be more realistic are ""The Hunchback of Notre Daame"" and ""The Phantom of the Opera."" The ugly guy or the cruel guy just never get the girl and vice versa. I hate to say the truth sometimes, but humans are cruel. We only care about people if they treat us kindly. The reason I love the unrealistic fairy tale is because I want to be like Belle and I wish there were more Belles out there. Unfortunately, this kind of behavior is seen as too happy, too sweet, and too ""nice-nice."" I'm sick of reading comments like those because they only support and prove my point. If you love someone unconditionally, it's viewed negatively because society believes that there is such a thing as ""too nice."" Oh please! Perhaps faking to be nice, but not actually being nice. Then if your viewed as a mean person, you're viewed negatively by being hateful. No one can please anybody! However, I can say I'd prefer ""too nice"" over just ""nice,"" ""mean,"" or ""too mean."" I think a rating should be based on movie quality and plot, not because something is ""too nice."" In my opinion, that's annoying to read and not very helpful.
In my regards to my rating of this movie, I give it a 4/5 stars because I loved the plot and would watch it again, but the acting, quality, and even some realism, was very poor.",1449273600,3,2523,4.3931623931623935

3138203,4,B00150N8EY,"Never a good thing when the most powerful man in the community is universally referred to as ""The Beast."" Eric Landry (Matthew Reese) is a cutthroat business consultant. He advises CEOs on how best to implement improvements into their companies. Eric Landry isn't much interested in self-improvement, never mind that he is without fail this spiteful and mean-spirited ogre.

Credit an apprehensive Belle Watson (Summer Naomi Smart) for not cowering in front of this terror of a man. When her repairman dad accidentally breaks an expensive vase in Eric's household, Eric threatens to call her dad's boss and have him fired. Belle instead works out a deal with Eric that allows her to temp as his unpaid assistant until the debt is paid, if only he would rescind her dad's termination. Never mind that she also attends school and works part-time at an orthodontist's office. Luckily for Belle, Eric had earlier that morning fired his assistant (or was it that she happily quit?). Belle's got her even-keeled temperament and a strong sense of empathy and she's got her faith. She's about to be tested.

Since it's just you and me talkin', I confess to sort of having fallen in love with Summer Smart during this film. I had never seen her before, but I was gobsmacked by how good and kind and patient her character is. She anchors this low-budgeted film, much more so than her co-lead, Matthew Reese, who ends up sort of likable by the end but whose early turn as a jerk is so over-the-top it didn't convince me. Plot-wise, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST: A LATTER-DAY TALE sticks fairly close to the fairy tale. Besides its being a modern-day retelling, the biggest shift is probably in the decision to not physically maim or bestialize Eric. The most profound element in the original fairy tale is that Belle was able to see something worthwhile underneath the Beast's terrible surface. Here, Eric may be a colossal tool but he's also good-looking. I've heard from the ladies that they were actuall sad when, in the Disney film, the Beast transformed into a handsome prince. Also, there has to be a suspension of disbelief with regards to that, in real life, folks would actually get so creatively pretentious as to come up with a nickname like ""The Beast"" for Eric. Probably we'd all be fine just calling him a scumsucking jackwagon. Under our breath, of course.

To quote my goofy local pastor: ""I'm not a very religious man."" I'm usually cautious around films with messages. Except that this film is really good and quite moving. Belle exudes such a warm sense of spirituality. I don't find the talks about faith to be at all preachy. There's something tender about Belle's gradual reformation of Eric, a man who used to believe but since has lost his way. Again, Summer Naomi Smart is so good and so appealing. She represents that strong role model for girls. As Belle, she stands up for herself; she stands by her values and beliefs; she's not obnoxious about it. Sometimes, it's all about casting the right person for the role, something you can't say about unsubtle lead actor Matthew Reese who chews scenery even when there's no call for it. Speaking of casting coups, the actor who plays ""Craig"" (the ""Gaston"" of the film) generates a creepy vibe from the moment he steps in front of the camera. He makes Gollum seem wholesome. But this movie isn't much about him.

The writers missed a great opportunity to convey how the Lord walks with us through hardship and is always there to comfort and help. She conveyed a religion, but no knowledge of who God really is - that He is a relational God who loves us. The only thing I liked was that this movie was clean. :)",1429401600,,607,4.3628318584070795

I regret that the credits are not easy to read, so I have not yet identified the actors. That's too bad because the lead actress is stunningly beautiful, and very talented. The lead actor is good, more on the Bill Pulman side. They develop a really lovely dynamic. Belle's friendship with Anna is very realistic. I did not catch the actress's name, but she's charming. The sister isn't a bad choice. The father and little brother less so. It is one of those movies that become like a favorite song. The music is nice, just not memorable. This definitely is on my ""favorites"" list. Five stars is a little high, but 4 didn't seem quite enough. I will pay attention to the credits and find the actors names (Stephanie Woods and Matthew Davis). They deserve the recognition. I would love to see more of this kind of work.

On reading other reviews of this movie, I see lots of other people find the cousin creepy--and he is. BUT he makes the storyline more believable to me. It was this kind of guy who used to hang around me! I just can't imagine why, other than her friendship with Anna, why she
didn't give Craig the gate after the ice cream incident!

I thought it was going to be a cute ROM/COM and since a movie doesn't need to have sex and profanity in it for me to enjoy it I started to watch it. Understand I have watched some bad movies all the way though... I couldn't even get past all the setup.
If you watch this be prepared for cheapness. They seem to think moral lessons shine forth in contrast to dull (and bargain basement) scripts and bad cutaway scenes. Looks as if a film school dropout was sleepwalking though this... maybe the script put him to sleep.",1424563200,2,594,4.409090909090909

3138465,4,B00150N8EY,I really liked the overall message of this movie in that there is redemption for lost souls and that love can be found if you dig deeper to get beyond the hearsay and gossip mongers.  This is a quiet little gem even though the acting is rather flat.  It does not just portray Christians as saved individuals with an everpresent smile on their faces.  These characters were real and some quite flawed and even spiteful.  I think this movie is worth a watch.,1423440000,,456,4.457831325301205

If I were a Christian parent, I wouldn't let my kids within a hundred miles of this video just because of that character. Still, there are some near-to-good performances (the younger sister, the coworker) and, except in a few places, it doesn't beat you over the head with religion. Faith and goodness are qualities best shown, not preached. I wanted to give it two-and-a-half stars as I didn't dislike it, I just didn't think it was very good quality. One advantage it does have over a lot of Christian romances is that it respects its female characters for their brains and work ethic as well as for their piety. It would have greatly benefitted from losing the Craig character altogether.",1421020800,2,830,4.852112676056338

3138490,1,B00150N8EY,The acting in this movie is painful. It is some kind of cross between made for TV movie and low play. I watched a HS made web series that had better acting than this. Even if the message is good or the idea is good with acting and presentation this bad how can one really look past it. I am very picky about movies but I must agree I would rather watch a dry documentary. I think it is great they wanted to make a Christian type film but seriously at least they could have tried to make it believable. I cannot think of anything that kills a movie faster than poor acting. It feels like the filmed it with a home video camera. Either than or they shot it at the wrong speed.

The acting is not believable, there is no real development in the characters they just change because that's the story line, the script is not realistic and the story line, even following the classic fairy tale, fails because the characters actions don't really ring true to reality.  I wanted this movie to have some redeeming value but it didn't.  While it predictably had a happy ending, it had so much more potential.  The last animated version was a better movie.  If Belle had not lost faith in the Beast then it would make more sense that he would want to change and be more like her.  And why make the guy who wants to date Belle such a wierdo?  Why not just allow her to not like him because she doesn't connect with him based on interests or something.  I hope no one actually pays to watch this movie!",1418947200,,992,4.324324324324325

I did appreciate the G-rated script as without sex it made the focus on love feel more natural and hinged on personality than lust.

My one beef *spoiler* is for the portion of the story where Belle is sent back into the world away from Beast, in this version it happens because the Beast is set up.

In reality, I do find it hard to believe they would end up together at the end. A good relationship is ""you and me vs. the world"" but at the first test of that Belle ditched the Beast. I know it was the only way to keep the plot true to the original and change up the whole ""her dad gets sick"" thing typically used, but this just made me feel Belle was a little too feckless.

But after I got use to his over the top cockiness I did not mind it so much anymore. The message to this movie was spot on. It touched on a few good points to remember. Bad things happen to good people all the time. I know this first hand working 14 years doing rescue work. Life is hard, it's brutal but then there is so much good about life. There's love, companionship, laughter and sadness. Yes, sometimes sadness is good and sadness CAN heal and strengthen oneself. At my station we have a brotherhood, a fellowship that is unmatched or rivaled. Same with this movie. Relationships take time to build, but if you have the courage and foresight you can build it into something fantastic. It does not have to be perfect or appear perfect. As long as you and whomever you decide to love is happy that is all that matters. I really enjoyed this movie. I think you will as well.

There are thousands of movies out there with sweet, romantic stories that are well made and entertaining.  This is not one of them.  Don't waste your time unless you just want to see how badly a movie can be made.",1409356800,,296,4.425925925925926
3138689,5,B00150N8EY,I liked Belle and the Beast. Watched it with my sister. We both agreed that it was good. It was not preachy but nice and sweet. Added it to my list of. Films to see over and over. I watched it 5-6 times this week. Acting not stellar but ok. I recommend this one thumbs up. A different and funny take on Beaty and the Beast.

3138692,3,B00150N8EY,"At first a little unbelievable with the cheaply made filming, but the story is very interesting because of the integrity of Bella and what she is willing to endure from another human being because of her belief system. It's believable and shows what love, patience, understanding and persistence can accomplish along with faith in God and another human being!",1409097600,,359,5.101694915254237
3138693,3,B00150N8EY,"This movie would benefit by a script edit and better direction. It drags in the middle and could use a few more twists and turns to the plot. Still, it was okay. The main actors were appealing. They didn't make Belle too good to be believable. The Beast was over the top horrible, and his transformation rather too sudden, but he was appealing, nonetheless. Good use of secondary characters, especially the younger sister.",1408924800,,422,4.794520547945205
3138694,5,B00150N8EY,"I enjoyed this movie because of how it brought the old ""Beauty and the Beast"" into real life, but sometimes, the attributes, such as ""beast,"" are not skin deep, but are inside the person.

The beast is a rich man who treats everyone as beneath him. He has no compassion for anyone, employee or stranger. He seems to have no friends. The Beauty is the daughter of a man who would be fired from his job because of an accident (knocking over an expensive vase at the beast's home), who bargains with the beast to allow her father to keep his job.

While they work together, the beast learns what it means to be human, to grow up and become a man instead of a beast, and along the way, things and circumstances allow others to benefit, while jealousy rears its ugly head with other people who THOUGHT they were Christian, but were merely trying to get things back to the way they were, when they were in control of Belle instead of letting her be in control of her own life.

This is a wonderful movie. I will be watching it again.

CAVEAT EMPTOR: This has been filmed as a type of ""Christian Parable"" but though it has been billed as a Christian Movie, they do it in a subdued way, so even non-Christians can enjoy the movie without feeling that they are being pressured by the content. I was pleasantly surprised that the plot overwhelmed the message.",1408838400,,1349,4.405622489959839

The acting and soundtrack was extremely amateurish.

However, as you get further into the storyline, the acting improves by leaps and bounds and the script becomes utterly charming. You just have to suffer through the beginning until it gets going. It gets much better, I promise. Overall, it is a very clean movie, which let's face it, is pretty hard to find anymore! Only the narrator is very preachy at all, and since this even says in the first frame or so that it is a Christian movie, it isn't nearly as preachy as it could have been! There are parts of the story that are really predicable, but at the same time, it is so sweet and charming that you will find yourself grinning like a goofball and cheering them on anyways! It's probably not going to win any awards, but it is definitely worth watching! I would have given it 5 stars, but the acting and script in the first few minutes really are pretty awful. When you see how good it is in the end, you'll wonder how they ever went along with those first few scenes. Also, if you like this, you should see Fireproof, that's a wonderful movie too!",1406678400,,1157,4.3119266055045875

It was a tad bit cheesy, I admit, but that didn't make it a bad movie. And, it was a completely clean movie that can be watched by the whole family. My 9 year old sister and 7 year old brother watched with me (the very first time I watched it!), and I didn't have to worry about any words, or scenes, which would be inappropriate for them. And we loved the bloopers. I thought it was a very good movie, especially since it's hard to find a good, clean romance movie, and it's hard to find Christian movies.

He was able to turn his professional loss around but the personal tragedy still haunted him. it affected both his personal and professional lives. Belle had a personal loss too but trusted God with it. She helps Eric to see how much better his life could be if he would do the same thing. What really inspired me about this movie is that it showed that your perspective on a ""trial"" really does make a difference! Eric not only wants Belle  but more importantly wants God!

3138903,5,B00150N8EY,Nice sweet modern day story! When I was growing up I loved Beauty and the beast. That version of course was kind of depraved since he was in fact a beast and who can fall in love with an animal? In this version he is just a nasty man. I love Belle she was really sweet and beautiful and only thinks of helping others! Love the ending and the characters!,1403395200,,353,4.057142857142857

I should have read the reviews first because I only made it to the part where ""beast"" throws the Bible in the hot tub and Belle says, ""But...that's God's word!""  Wah wah - movie over.  I didn't expect a preachy spiritual movie.  There should be a warning!

I'm a sucker for fairy tales and while this movie stuck to the B&B story line, it really was hard to like the Beast for most of the story. Most other B&B story lines have the Beast grouchy but still trying to vie for 'Belle's' attention. This one, not so much.

3138952,4,B00150N8EY,"Though not uncommon for a Christian film, the first few minutes are very cheesy. Eric, the beast, acts out - yelling and throwing tantrums at his staff - in the beginning of the movie in an unrealistic/fake/cheesy fashion at the beginning of the film. Watching how subpar the first few minutes were made my wife and I want to turn the film off. However, it was a late Friday and we didn't want to spend time finding another movie, so we held on.

We're glad we did. While the acting throughout the movie was remained a slight bit over the top, the message was a very good one. A modern day ""beauty and the beast"" twist, tying in faith in God and the importance of being kind and loving to others.

All around, it's worth watching. It's a feel good, so you've got to be in that kind of mood, but the message is well worth it.",1400803200,,824,4.24203821656051

3138958,4,B00150N8EY,"I really enjoyed this movie. I consider myself a film gourmet though occasionally some mind candy in the form of a light romantic comedy is great. Additionally I am not Christian ( jewish) and don't typically watch movies that a labeled as christian ....not that there is anything wrong with that category.....i like to keep an open mind....I rate movies based on what I think they tried to achieve and if the chemistry of tbe actors along with the goals works, I usually like the movie. This movie was highly predictable and both Belle and tbe "" beast"" are very attractive actors....It could have been more interesting perhaps if the actor playing the beast did not look like a Macy's model (ie someone who is fit, clean and attractive without the Jude Law gourgeousness)....But I digress.... What I liked about it was that the characters had challenges and conflicts, there were a few more surprising twists than I expected and the message of having patience and empathy for people, not giving in to obstacles and working hard are universal themes that are true and appealing. I liked that this movie made me feel good at tbe end, just like a good fairy tale should and that if someone watched it with their kids, there would be no moments of regret on the part of tbe parents......and for tbe Christian message of GD and faith......they were not too frequent and not too preachy....so while not a plus for me, not enough of a negative not to recommend this cute movie as a very light and pleasant time.",1400371200,,1505,4.661654135338346

Is there any good in him at all?

Beauty and the Beast in modern days, this Christian romance is sweet and often humorous.  There were so many times when we just laughed and laughed.

The idea of the story is that God wants us to be happy. Sometimes bad things happen to good people, but that doesnt mean God isn't there or that He doesnt care.

It unfortunately was just very low budget, poorly directed and most importantly should have had way better (and much less cheesy) writing.  Super super unrealistic dialogue and story line between Belle and the Beast character, when it seemed like they were going for realistic.  Here are some examples from the movie that I don't think are healthy messages, when the whole point of this movie seems to be that it is a healthy message movie.  Way too creepy with the other guy stalking Belle - that did not flow or make sense with her strong character to allow a creepy guy to treat her the way he did. She says she is being ""nice"", but she doesn't seem truly nice to him, the nice thing would be to be honest not to keep leading him on for as long as she does, which is what causes a 'big problem' later on -if only she'd been straight with him at the start of the movie (not that the movie shows that it was her actions that led to it - she is depicted as the sterotype 'perfect girl').  She also becomes suddenly harsh and unreasonable to the ""Beast"" character and can't even hear an explanation, even though her character was super 'patient' through most of the movie with both the Beast and the creepy guy.  Not a good heroine example for young people watching the movie.  So bizarre and horrible writing and actions for her best friend character, not a good friend at all who unrelentlessly pushes the creep on Belle over and over  - oh and her dad situation is so bizarre as well -  weird movie!

3139023,3,B00150N8EY,This  retelling of Beauty and the Beast felt kind of corny. The broken vase leading to threat of termination which lead to Belle to the rescue was sweet gesture but not believable.

I know the acting isnt' the best, laughable, but really it's better than something I'd put together.  If you are lookiing for a cute kinda romance that doesn't use profanity or God's name in vain, this is a fun movie to watch.  No it's not an oscar (SPOILER SPOILER esp. the kiss at the end hahaha - yes laughable) but if you are just looking for a cute movie this is it.  And I thought Belle's feelings of being insulted, esp. with the circumstances of the job, was believable.  I'd be like that totally.  You can't let every rude comment make you fly off the handle.  and that wannabe boyfriend was just creepy, I wish something worse happened to him for what he did, but it's just a movie.",1395705600,,800,4.322147651006712

The two lead characters Belle (nod to the Beauty character in the traditional fairytale) and Eric Landry (Beast) are engaging together, and the film does a decent job of weaving Belle's faith and beliefs as an important part of the story without coming across as ultra-religious.  It's not meant to be an Oscar contender:  this is a ""chick flick"" suitable for family viewing.  Recommend when looking for a feel good romantic story with character.",1394150400,,593,5.082474226804123

She literally saves Erik from his downward spiral.  I only hope that one day the makers of this movie will make a sequel.  I want Belle and Erik to get married and have some little Landry's and that they will build a happy life together.  I hope ugly, stupid Craig gets his comeuppance in the sequel, should there be one. He broke the law!  He is without a doubt the most goofy, idiotic young man on the planet.  In fact, he is probably from another planet.  You will love this movie if you purchase it.

3139055,2,B00150N8EY,"Unfortunately, I am exactly the type of person to watch just about anything before I pass judgement. I love romantic movies and generally like them as long as the story flows well and the characters are likeable enough.

This would not be considered a romance by any stretch of the imagination, nor does it lend any sort of similarity to the tale of Beauty and the Beast. This is a story about a cranky man that yells for no apparent reason and a girl that for some reason is less susceptible to emotions than others. The characters are menial, the story even worse, and there is no acting worthy of even being called a ""film"".

If you can make it through the entire film once, I applaud you. If you can bear to watch it multiple times, you must not watch movies very often, let alone romances.

And I would hope no one mentions that it is poor quality because of the Christian nature of the film. Watch End of the Spear... enough said.",1393113600,,936,4.367816091954023

I kept trying to avoid the explanation, but I finally had to answer my daughter's questions about what they were referring to as ""the bottle"" and alcohol.  Really didn't want my kids to have to associate drinking with being a problem, particularly since practically every adult they know and love drinks alcohol (albeit responsibly).

It is a great message to kids who feel so much worldly pressure to be rich and successful. At what cost is that kind of path going to lead us. It is clear; it is not the best path to choose.  Anyone who has lost a loved one or an important relationship will relate to this story. Where is God? How could Jesus do this to me? But God always seems to send us at least one person who won't give up and will show us what love and faith are, again. There is always someone out there who loves us for who we are, good or bad, and that person is like an anchor in the storm.  With those lessons aside, this film will tug at your heart strings, in a good way. You will definitely find the beast, the beauty and a very good villain in this film.  I did not have any preconceived ideas before watching.  So I was pleasantly surprised to find a good story, good twists and very good acting. Just my humble opinion, but I give it two thumbs up.",1390867200,,1089,3.9907834101382487

Even though religion and the belief of God was in play, that common belief got the man believing in others and he did not fall prey to the evils in his past.

Christian produced material lacks creativity and scripting ability far too often. The religious message becomes heavy-handed and the acting... I've seen better by amateurs (Christian amateurs) on the community theater stage.

I finally had to gong this one. This adaptation failed to deliver and the religious message really destroyed the delivery method.

Look, it does little good to preach if those to whom you preach tune you out. This is why Christians are supposed to ""witness""- not preach. People will listen to the tales, the parables but few want to hear preachy speeches.

Show- don't tell the tale. Let the parable do the work for you.

This piece just labors the tale and that's a shame. It could have been an enjoyable piece that also left a message about relationships.",1376179200,5,900,4.933774834437086

In that one, his PHYSICAL being was the beast, but his core was in fact also gentle beauty.  In this film, the male lead is perhaps physically attractive, but he is at core - personality over appearance - a wretch.

Belle and the Beast: A Christian Romance uses the Bible as the book for their religion. Beauty and the Beast: A Latter-Day Tale uses the Book of Mormon as the book for their religion - plus it has a few extra clips during the movie.

I think they made ""A Latter-Day Tale"" first and then changed the movie to appeal to a difference audience; and therefore, had to cut a few scenes to put in the bible. It all depends on which one you prefer. The rest of the movie is the same.

I like ""A Latter-Day Tale"" better and will definitely watch it again.  See my review of Beauty and the Beast: A Latter-Day Tale.",1369785600,2,759,4.286713286713287

You could see his progress back to humanity and that made up for some of the other faults.

The camera shots, set design, wardrobe and make up looked like a middle school play shop design. This is a TBN production it seems, but I expected much more from them than this.

The story is pretty typical.  Belle ends up in an agreement where she has to work for ""The Beast"" to save her dad's job, he is the primary wage earner and a widower.  I won't give more plot points or spoilers, but I'm sure you get the gist of the movie.  I do think it is worth your time if you want to watch a good family type of movie.

I think it hit its low point when Eric tells Belle about the horrors of being trapped in a car with his dead wife, praying for her to be alive but knowing she was not.  Belle's response:  ""Some times bad things happen to good people.""  Eric didn't even blink.  He should have thrown her in the lake.  THAT would have improved the movie a lot.

I had no clue what I was getting into with this flick, but it didn't take me long to figure out that this was a Christian film that I could honestly say I truly enjoyed. My goal is to review all of the Christian movies I can find. As I watch them, I always have a critical eye upon them which usually spies out unrealistic or contrived situations/plots, cardboard characters, poor acting, etc, forcing me to deduct style points and feel bad that I can't extol the virtues of the film and recommend it highly to everyone. It feels so good to run across a film with a good Christian message that delighted me all the way around.  I can't believe that this story only got three doves from the Dove Foundation.

Eric comes across initially as a rude and arrogant man, who buries himself in his work to cover the pain of his past loss. Belle's father, because of a careless accident causes Belle to be forced to work for Eric.

Over a period to time, like all things, a fondness starts to develop between Eric and Belle. The plot in this film is not very thick, so to inspire some excitement Belle's young admirer is used to bring in some intrigue.

I am not advocating the traditional model of a relationship in which the the man is the head and the woman a mere submissive puppet; I appreciated Belle's confidence and independence.

3371621,5,B00150N8EY,"Yes, as other reviewers have mentioned,  the acting is sub-par... in the beginning. After a while, though, the characters become more comfortable with their on-screen personas and the stiltedness eases. Stephanie Wood, who plays Belle, is excellent from the beginning. She really is the star of this production.
Regarding the movie, though, I thought the interpretation was excellent! Very well done transition to a modern day scenario. It IS written from a Christian perspective, so that might put people off who do not follow that particular faith, but there's no Bible punching in this movie. They do discuss death and loss from a Christian perspective, but in such a way that it is a normal discussion between a believer and a non-believer. (The cheesy ""bad things happen to good people"" should never have been allowed into the final copy, though. Fire the editor! LOL)
As in the original novel, Belle goes to the ""Beast"" aka Eric Landry, to plead for her father and agrees to work for Eric to pay off her father's debt. Her sweet nature and caring personality seep into the cracks in Eric's hard heart and make him aware that he cannot turn his back on the world. The ""rampaging villagers"" ended up being Belle's suitor, Craig (or Greg, I wasn't sure!) who, rejected by her, causes trouble for Eric to get her to leave him. This succeeds in driving Belle away, but not, as he hoped, into Craig's arms. I won't give away the plot by telling you what he does or how it is all resolved, but it does follow the original novel fairly faithfully.
Overall, I chose this as I needed a feel good movie to watch as I was doing manual labor (stuffing goodie bags) and I thoroughly enjoyed it once I got past the very still first half hour. Recommended, especially for families of younger children, Christian families of all ages, and anyone who still believes in the magic of true love!",1498176000,4,1880,4.696969696969697

God's wants to transform us into Christ-like character and while happiness often comes as a result of pursuing holiness,  seeking happiness in the absence of obedience to God does not make us ""good people"" and certainly does not gain us entry into heaven.  There is no mention of Jesus or the Gospel of salvation at all in this movie and there is no illustration of the disciplines of faith other than one scene when Belle is shown reading the Bible.  There is false characterization of churches as being the main source of negativity (""he's a beast, everyone at church says so"").  The main male character who supposedly had his heart transformed by God never even opened the Bible.  This movie had the opportunity to offer true hope to people who are seeking joy and meaning but instead if only offered a false doctrine.  How disappointing.",1484870400,3,954,4.704819277108434

3372118,1,B00150N8EY,"I remember watching this movie when it came out..saw it and hate it. The acting was sooo bad, you rolled your eyes so many times you may have a seizure.

I swore never to see it again..but I was bored and saw it and I could not remember much about it ( my brain protecting itself blocked it out) so I watched it again and it is all coming back. The flash backs for horrible plot, horrible acting, horrible everything!

Belle the good for everything, good daughter, good sister, good christian person who thinks good about everybody. Goes to school, goes to work, cooks, cleans, watches the siblings and also works longs hours with the ""beast""

The beast..rich guy who loses his wife like 10 years ago..now he yells at everybody, his poor maid just sort of grew deaf to all his nasty behavior. Then here comes belle, talking about God and goodness. All of the sudden he sees the light ( cue hallelujah) but some desperate boy with a crush..just ups a calls a power company and uses his name to get belle's dad in trouble.

This is where the bad acting really starts...she runs and tells him off and the beast is devastated.etc etc etc

Just really bad acting, abusive, lying, bad bad. I would recommend avoiding this train wreck unless you are into sappy romantic movies and have 20 cats..you won't like it.",1472860800,5,1306,4.516949152542373

A little corny for real life but it was entertaining. Definitely a chick flick. Good for all audiences with squeaky clean language and no sexual  content.

It is sweet and a decent option if you've already binge watched all you favorite shows and there's nothing on tv. It pretty much ends there though. Not sure if it was the acting, the writing or the low budget camera work a combination of the all 3, but I can't say that it was a GOOD movie, it was just ok. I probably won't go back and re-watch this one, but I don't feel like watching it was a total waste of time either.

I like the faith-based aspect to it and that it was romantic.  If you're looking for a film with gratuitous sexuality, move on because you won't find it here.

3372358,1,B00150N8EY,I have to agree with other reviewers about the bad acting. It's pretty bad. How bad? So bad.,1459814400,3,92,4.166666666666667
3372359,1,B00150N8EY,"This is a feel-good movie soured by 1940s sexual stereotypes. The hero of the story, Belle, turns around the life of a hate-filled man (""the Beast"") by showering him with sympathy and understanding. That's about the only good thing to say about this movie. Unfortunately, Belle exists in this movie only to serve men, and this movie basically says that is the role of a good woman.

We learn at the beginning of the movie that Belle began serving her father when her mother (his wife) dies. She drops out of college in California, returns home, and helps with the raising of her younger siblings and working part-time. Then, to save her hapless father from being fired from him job, she takes another job as an indentured servant to ""the Beast,"" a wealthy man whose mission in life early in the movie is to make people unhappy.

Since Belle has a good heart, she showers the Beast with kindness and respect even though he treats her like dirt, criticizing her and requiring her to perform menial jobs so he doesn't have her father fired from his job. Later, we learn the Beast is so hate-filled because he lost his wife in an automobile accident.

Belle then pours on more kindness and they fall in love. The Beast then rescues her from what promised to be a dead-end, poverty-ridden life and takes care of her in luxury and style. Ah, yes, women can't survive without a rich and powerful knight to rescue them.

A weird side story of this movie is a stalker-like friend of a friend who professes his enduring love for Belle and insists she eventually will grow to love him. Instead of putting great distance between her and this creepy guy, she is constantly nice to him -- only until she learns she has his father fired by making a fake phone call to his company. This subplot reminds us, the viewer, how it is best for women to be nice to men even when they are possessive stalkers.

As other reviewers also point out, the acting in this movie is of the high-school-stage caliber. If the acting were more honest and heart-felt and the story more realistic, I would have given this movie 2 stars instead of the one.",1459382400,9,2117,4.531413612565445

It was also really disturbing how Belle felt the need to be ""nice"" to a man who was legit stalking her and creepy intense during their interactions. Let's not confuse true Christian virtue and kindness with the inability of a grown woman to assert her boundaries. Kind of unhealthy. Overall, this movie was a real dud in my opinion.

It is obvious this was low budget.  You can usually tell when a lot of money was spent on a movie and this definitely was not one of them. However, despite that, it was a great movie.  First off, I love the character of Eric Landry and how he transforms during the course of the movie.  He was almost impossible not to love by the end of the movie.  The only thing that really bugged me was the character Craig.  I did not like him at all...I thought he was annoying and stalkerish.  I realize he played a part in the plot though, so although he annoyed me, he did add to the plot development.  I liked that this was a clean movie, but yet romantic and sweet.

3372538,4,B00150N8EY,"I love the plot of this movie. Then again I can't resist any Beauty and the Beast story. I love them all! It is my favorite fairy tale. Why? Because it is the most unrealistic fairy tale yet the only fairy tale I wish would be true. Think about it, Cinderella gets a prince because of her outer beauty, Rapunzel gets a prince by having beautiful hair, even in Disney movies, Ariel acts like a brat to get what she wants, Tiana and Naveen work hard to please each other, etc. These are fairly realistic situations. How many times does someone ""Fall in Love"" with someone because he/she is hot? Or tries too hard to make somebody happy? Or demand what they want? Let's face it, assuming you have a normal and non-abusive family, your parents are the only ones who will love you even when you do something wrong. No one else. Yet Beauty and the Beast demonstrates the impossible: Unconditional love. Love that lasts even while a person is cruel, mean, bitter, or beastly. I can guarantee that a mother will love her son while he's in prison, but the wife will be quick to want a divorce. If Belle were real, she would not do that. She would be the rare or unrealistic wife that stays. In fact, the Beauty and the Beast stories that I find to be more realistic are ""The Hunchback of Notre Daame"" and ""The Phantom of the Opera."" The ugly guy or the cruel guy just never get the girl and vice versa. I hate to say the truth sometimes, but humans are cruel. We only care about people if they treat us kindly. The reason I love the unrealistic fairy tale is because I want to be like Belle and I wish there were more Belles out there. Unfortunately, this kind of behavior is seen as too happy, too sweet, and too ""nice-nice."" I'm sick of reading comments like those because they only support and prove my point. If you love someone unconditionally, it's viewed negatively because society believes that there is such a thing as ""too nice."" Oh please! Perhaps faking to be nice, but not actually being nice. Then if your viewed as a mean person, you're viewed negatively by being hateful. No one can please anybody! However, I can say I'd prefer ""too nice"" over just ""nice,"" ""mean,"" or ""too mean."" I think a rating should be based on movie quality and plot, not because something is ""too nice."" In my opinion, that's annoying to read and not very helpful.
In my regards to my rating of this movie, I give it a 4/5 stars because I loved the plot and would watch it again, but the acting, quality, and even some realism, was very poor.",1449273600,3,2523,4.3931623931623935

Then i looked into it further and discovered it's a Mormon movie. Ahhh. ...that explains it. Mormons are not considered Christians by the evangelical Christians and their  beliefs do not align with the  truth of the Bible. ...hence the lack of a decent message in this movie. I don't like the misleading use of the word Christian on their title and really don't like the fact that I supported their cause by being another number that watched this film.,1443225600,3,587,4.735294117647059

3372700,4,B00150N8EY,"Never a good thing when the most powerful man in the community is universally referred to as ""The Beast."" Eric Landry (Matthew Reese) is a cutthroat business consultant. He advises CEOs on how best to implement improvements into their companies. Eric Landry isn't much interested in self-improvement, never mind that he is without fail this spiteful and mean-spirited ogre.

Credit an apprehensive Belle Watson (Summer Naomi Smart) for not cowering in front of this terror of a man. When her repairman dad accidentally breaks an expensive vase in Eric's household, Eric threatens to call her dad's boss and have him fired. Belle instead works out a deal with Eric that allows her to temp as his unpaid assistant until the debt is paid, if only he would rescind her dad's termination. Never mind that she also attends school and works part-time at an orthodontist's office. Luckily for Belle, Eric had earlier that morning fired his assistant (or was it that she happily quit?). Belle's got her even-keeled temperament and a strong sense of empathy and she's got her faith. She's about to be tested.

Since it's just you and me talkin', I confess to sort of having fallen in love with Summer Smart during this film. I had never seen her before, but I was gobsmacked by how good and kind and patient her character is. She anchors this low-budgeted film, much more so than her co-lead, Matthew Reese, who ends up sort of likable by the end but whose early turn as a jerk is so over-the-top it didn't convince me. Plot-wise, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST: A LATTER-DAY TALE sticks fairly close to the fairy tale. Besides its being a modern-day retelling, the biggest shift is probably in the decision to not physically maim or bestialize Eric. The most profound element in the original fairy tale is that Belle was able to see something worthwhile underneath the Beast's terrible surface. Here, Eric may be a colossal tool but he's also good-looking. I've heard from the ladies that they were actuall sad when, in the Disney film, the Beast transformed into a handsome prince. Also, there has to be a suspension of disbelief with regards to that, in real life, folks would actually get so creatively pretentious as to come up with a nickname like ""The Beast"" for Eric. Probably we'd all be fine just calling him a scumsucking jackwagon. Under our breath, of course.

To quote my goofy local pastor: ""I'm not a very religious man."" I'm usually cautious around films with messages. Except that this film is really good and quite moving. Belle exudes such a warm sense of spirituality. I don't find the talks about faith to be at all preachy. There's something tender about Belle's gradual reformation of Eric, a man who used to believe but since has lost his way. Again, Summer Naomi Smart is so good and so appealing. She represents that strong role model for girls. As Belle, she stands up for herself; she stands by her values and beliefs; she's not obnoxious about it. Sometimes, it's all about casting the right person for the role, something you can't say about unsubtle lead actor Matthew Reese who chews scenery even when there's no call for it. Speaking of casting coups, the actor who plays ""Craig"" (the ""Gaston"" of the film) generates a creepy vibe from the moment he steps in front of the camera. He makes Gollum seem wholesome. But this movie isn't much about him.

The writers missed a great opportunity to convey how the Lord walks with us through hardship and is always there to comfort and help. She conveyed a religion, but no knowledge of who God really is - that He is a relational God who loves us. The only thing I liked was that this movie was clean. :)",1429401600,,607,4.3628318584070795

I regret that the credits are not easy to read, so I have not yet identified the actors. That's too bad because the lead actress is stunningly beautiful, and very talented. The lead actor is good, more on the Bill Pulman side. They develop a really lovely dynamic. Belle's friendship with Anna is very realistic. I did not catch the actress's name, but she's charming. The sister isn't a bad choice. The father and little brother less so. It is one of those movies that become like a favorite song. The music is nice, just not memorable. This definitely is on my ""favorites"" list. Five stars is a little high, but 4 didn't seem quite enough. I will pay attention to the credits and find the actors names (Stephanie Woods and Matthew Davis). They deserve the recognition. I would love to see more of this kind of work.

On reading other reviews of this movie, I see lots of other people find the cousin creepy--and he is. BUT he makes the storyline more believable to me. It was this kind of guy who used to hang around me! I just can't imagine why, other than her friendship with Anna, why she
didn't give Craig the gate after the ice cream incident!

If you watch this be prepared for cheapness. They seem to think moral lessons shine forth in contrast to dull (and bargain basement) scripts and bad cutaway scenes.

Still, there are some near-to-good performances (the younger sister, the coworker) and, except in a few places, it doesn't beat you over the head with religion. Faith and goodness are qualities best shown, not preached. I wanted to give it two-and-a-half stars as I didn't dislike it, I just didn't think it was very good quality. One advantage it does have over a lot of Christian romances is that it respects its female characters for their brains and work ethic as well as for their piety.

Even if the message is good or the idea is good with acting and presentation this bad how can one really look past it. I am very picky about movies but I must agree I would rather watch a dry documentary. I think it is great they wanted to make a Christian type film but seriously at least they could have tried to make it believable. I cannot think of anything that kills a movie faster than poor acting. It feels like the filmed it with a home video camera. Either than or they shot it at the wrong speed.

The acting is not believable, there is no real development in the characters they just change because that's the story line, the script is not realistic and the story line, even following the classic fairy tale, fails because the characters actions don't really ring true to reality.  I wanted this movie to have some redeeming value but it didn't.  While it predictably had a happy ending, it had so much more potential.  The last animated version was a better movie.  If Belle had not lost faith in the Beast then it would make more sense that he would want to change and be more like her.  And why make the guy who wants to date Belle such a wierdo?  Why not just allow her to not like him because she doesn't connect with him based on interests or something.  I hope no one actually pays to watch this movie!",1418947200,,992,4.324324324324325

3373065,4,B00150N8EY,"This is a very sweet and intelligent romantic drama. An excellent modern twist on an old fairy tale surprisingly the few mentions of God didn't offend this atheist. I did appreciate the G-rated script as without sex it made the focus on love feel more natural and hinged on personality than lust.

My one beef *spoiler* is for the portion of the story where Belle is sent back into the world away from Beast, in this version it happens because the Beast is set up.

In reality, I do find it hard to believe they would end up together at the end. A good relationship is ""you and me vs. the world"" but at the first test of that Belle ditched the Beast. I know it was the only way to keep the plot true to the original and change up the whole ""her dad gets sick"" thing typically used, but this just made me feel Belle was a little too feckless.

Still it's sweet, wholesome, and amazingly cute.",1417305600,3,891,4.260355029585799

But after I got use to his over the top cockiness I did not mind it so much anymore. The message to this movie was spot on. It touched on a few good points to remember. Bad things happen to good people all the time. I know this first hand working 14 years doing rescue work. Life is hard, it's brutal but then there is so much good about life. There's love, companionship, laughter and sadness. Yes, sometimes sadness is good and sadness CAN heal and strengthen oneself. At my station we have a brotherhood, a fellowship that is unmatched or rivaled. Same with this movie. Relationships take time to build, but if you have the courage and foresight you can build it into something fantastic. It does not have to be perfect or appear perfect. As long as you and whomever you decide to love is happy that is all that matters. I really enjoyed this movie. I think you will as well.

The main actors were appealing. They didn't make Belle too good to be believable. The Beast was over the top horrible, and his transformation rather too sudden, but he was appealing, nonetheless. Good use of secondary characters, especially the younger sister.",1408924800,,422,4.794520547945205
3373191,5,B00150N8EY,"I enjoyed this movie because of how it brought the old ""Beauty and the Beast"" into real life, but sometimes, the attributes, such as ""beast,"" are not skin deep, but are inside the person.

The beast is a rich man who treats everyone as beneath him. He has no compassion for anyone, employee or stranger. He seems to have no friends. The Beauty is the daughter of a man who would be fired from his job because of an accident (knocking over an expensive vase at the beast's home), who bargains with the beast to allow her father to keep his job.

While they work together, the beast learns what it means to be human, to grow up and become a man instead of a beast, and along the way, things and circumstances allow others to benefit, while jealousy rears its ugly head with other people who THOUGHT they were Christian, but were merely trying to get things back to the way they were, when they were in control of Belle instead of letting her be in control of her own life.

This is a wonderful movie. I will be watching it again.

CAVEAT EMPTOR: This has been filmed as a type of ""Christian Parable"" but though it has been billed as a Christian Movie, they do it in a subdued way, so even non-Christians can enjoy the movie without feeling that they are being pressured by the content. I was pleasantly surprised that the plot overwhelmed the message.",1408838400,,1349,4.405622489959839

However, as you get further into the storyline, the acting improves by leaps and bounds and the script becomes utterly charming. You just have to suffer through the beginning until it gets going. It gets much better, I promise. Overall, it is a very clean movie, which let's face it, is pretty hard to find anymore! Only the narrator is very preachy at all, and since this even says in the first frame or so that it is a Christian movie, it isn't nearly as preachy as it could have been! There are parts of the story that are really predicable, but at the same time, it is so sweet and charming that you will find yourself grinning like a goofball and cheering them on anyways! It's probably not going to win any awards, but it is definitely worth watching! I would have given it 5 stars, but the acting and script in the first few minutes really are pretty awful. When you see how good it is in the end, you'll wonder how they ever went along with those first few scenes.

My 9 year old sister and 7 year old brother watched with me (the very first time I watched it!), and I didn't have to worry about any words, or scenes, which would be inappropriate for them.

at how people can embrace each other, even when someone seems embraceable.

why someone acts as they act and you never know how your interaction may help
someone else.",1404000000,,327,4.620689655172414
3373367,4,B00150N8EY,"I rented this film today and just finished watching it. The summary said it was a modern take on the old fairy tale. It was much more than that! It was a glimpse into the life of a successful businessman who had a terrible personal loss and professional loss. He was able to turn his professional loss around but the personal tragedy still haunted him. it affected both his personal and professional lives. Belle had a personal loss too but trusted God with it. She helps Eric to see how much better his life could be if he would do the same thing. What really inspired me about this movie is that it showed that your perspective on a ""trial"" really does make a difference! Eric not only wants Belle  but more importantly wants God! Yes the ending was corny, but I love corny endings especially these days with all the violence,sex and bad language movies normally have.",1403913600,,870,4.506329113924051

That version of course was kind of depraved since he was in fact a beast and who can fall in love with an animal? In this version he is just a nasty man.

I should have read the reviews first because I only made it to the part where ""beast"" throws the Bible in the hot tub and Belle says, ""But...that's God's word!""  Wah wah - movie over.  I didn't expect a preachy spiritual movie.  There should be a warning!

Eric, the beast, acts out - yelling and throwing tantrums at his staff - in the beginning of the movie in an unrealistic/fake/cheesy fashion at the beginning of the film. Watching how subpar the first few minutes were made my wife and I want to turn the film off. However, it was a late Friday and we didn't want to spend time finding another movie, so we held on.

We're glad we did. While the acting throughout the movie was remained a slight bit over the top, the message was a very good one. A modern day ""beauty and the beast"" twist, tying in faith in God and the importance of being kind and loving to others.

All around, it's worth watching. It's a feel good, so you've got to be in that kind of mood, but the message is well worth it.",1400803200,,824,4.24203821656051

Additionally I am not Christian ( jewish) and don't typically watch movies that a labeled as christian ....not that there is anything wrong with that category.....i like to keep an open mind....I rate movies based on what I think they tried to achieve and if the chemistry of tbe actors along with the goals works, I usually like the movie. This movie was highly predictable and both Belle and tbe "" beast"" are very attractive actors....It could have been more interesting perhaps if the actor playing the beast did not look like a Macy's model (ie someone who is fit, clean and attractive without the Jude Law gourgeousness)....But I digress.... What I liked about it was that the characters had challenges and conflicts, there were a few more surprising twists than I expected and the message of having patience and empathy for people, not giving in to obstacles and working hard are universal themes that are true and appealing. I liked that this movie made me feel good at tbe end, just like a good fairy tale should and that if someone watched it with their kids, there would be no moments of regret on the part of tbe parents......and for tbe Christian message of GD and faith......they were not too frequent and not too preachy....so while not a plus for me, not enough of a negative not to recommend this cute movie as a very light and pleasant time.",1400371200,,1505,4.661654135338346

Is there any good in him at all?

Beauty and the Beast in modern days, this Christian romance is sweet and often humorous.  There were so many times when we just laughed and laughed.

The idea of the story is that God wants us to be happy. Sometimes bad things happen to good people, but that doesnt mean God isn't there or that He doesnt care.

It unfortunately was just very low budget, poorly directed and most importantly should have had way better (and much less cheesy) writing.  Super super unrealistic dialogue and story line between Belle and the Beast character, when it seemed like they were going for realistic.  Here are some examples from the movie that I don't think are healthy messages, when the whole point of this movie seems to be that it is a healthy message movie.  Way too creepy with the other guy stalking Belle - that did not flow or make sense with her strong character to allow a creepy guy to treat her the way he did. She says she is being ""nice"", but she doesn't seem truly nice to him, the nice thing would be to be honest not to keep leading him on for as long as she does, which is what causes a 'big problem' later on -if only she'd been straight with him at the start of the movie (not that the movie shows that it was her actions that led to it - she is depicted as the sterotype 'perfect girl').  She also becomes suddenly harsh and unreasonable to the ""Beast"" character and can't even hear an explanation, even though her character was super 'patient' through most of the movie with both the Beast and the creepy guy.  Not a good heroine example for young people watching the movie.  So bizarre and horrible writing and actions for her best friend character, not a good friend at all who unrelentlessly pushes the creep on Belle over and over  - oh and her dad situation is so bizarre as well -  weird movie!

3373515,2,B00150N8EY,Actors handicapped by poorly written script. Poor chemistry between leading actors. The production was rather amateurish. But I watched the whole film because the leading actress was quite captivating.,1396569600,2,201,5.9655172413793105
3373516,4,B00150N8EY,This is a good movie. I recommend this movie to anyone because it shows the value of patience. There is tolerance in patience. This movie shows that in the right person patience makes one stronger and capable in a world we cannot control.,1396396800,,238,4.558139534883721

3373520,3,B00150N8EY,This  retelling of Beauty and the Beast felt kind of corny. The broken vase leading to threat of termination which lead to Belle to the rescue was sweet gesture but not believable.

I know the acting isnt' the best, laughable, but really it's better than something I'd put together.  If you are lookiing for a cute kinda romance that doesn't use profanity or God's name in vain, this is a fun movie to watch.  No it's not an oscar (SPOILER SPOILER esp. the kiss at the end hahaha - yes laughable) but if you are just looking for a cute movie this is it.  And I thought Belle's feelings of being insulted, esp. with the circumstances of the job, was believable.  I'd be like that totally.  You can't let every rude comment make you fly off the handle.  and that wannabe boyfriend was just creepy, I wish something worse happened to him for what he did, but it's just a movie.",1395705600,,800,4.322147651006712

The two lead characters Belle (nod to the Beauty character in the traditional fairytale) and Eric Landry (Beast) are engaging together, and the film does a decent job of weaving Belle's faith and beliefs as an important part of the story without coming across as ultra-religious.  It's not meant to be an Oscar contender:  this is a ""chick flick"" suitable for family viewing.  Recommend when looking for a feel good romantic story with character.",1394150400,,593,5.082474226804123

She literally saves Erik from his downward spiral.  I only hope that one day the makers of this movie will make a sequel.  I want Belle and Erik to get married and have some little Landry's and that they will build a happy life together.  I hope ugly, stupid Craig gets his comeuppance in the sequel, should there be one. He broke the law!  He is without a doubt the most goofy, idiotic young man on the planet.  In fact, he is probably from another planet.  You will love this movie if you purchase it.

3373552,2,B00150N8EY,"Unfortunately, I am exactly the type of person to watch just about anything before I pass judgement. I love romantic movies and generally like them as long as the story flows well and the characters are likeable enough.

This would not be considered a romance by any stretch of the imagination, nor does it lend any sort of similarity to the tale of Beauty and the Beast. This is a story about a cranky man that yells for no apparent reason and a girl that for some reason is less susceptible to emotions than others. The characters are menial, the story even worse, and there is no acting worthy of even being called a ""film"".

If you can make it through the entire film once, I applaud you. If you can bear to watch it multiple times, you must not watch movies very often, let alone romances.

And I would hope no one mentions that it is poor quality because of the Christian nature of the film. Watch End of the Spear... enough said.",1393113600,,936,4.367816091954023

It is a great message to kids who feel so much worldly pressure to be rich and successful. At what cost is that kind of path going to lead us. It is clear; it is not the best path to choose.  Anyone who has lost a loved one or an important relationship will relate to this story. Where is God? How could Jesus do this to me? But God always seems to send us at least one person who won't give up and will show us what love and faith are, again. There is always someone out there who loves us for who we are, good or bad, and that person is like an anchor in the storm.  With those lessons aside, this film will tug at your heart strings, in a good way. You will definitely find the beast, the beauty and a very good villain in this film.  I did not have any preconceived ideas before watching.  So I was pleasantly surprised to find a good story, good twists and very good acting.

Even though religion and the belief of God was in play, that common belief got the man believing in others and he did not fall prey to the evils in his past.

The ""Christian"" value was that God wants us to be happy, which is not found anywhere in the Bible. God wants us to glorify Him through repenting of out sins and accepting the salvation and forgiveness from those sins that Jesus bought for us on the cross.

I felt this movie made a mockery of my faith. I would rather they had just done a clean romance and left the psuedo-Christian references out. Please don't watch this.

Christian produced material lacks creativity and scripting ability far too often. The religious message becomes heavy-handed and the acting... I've seen better by amateurs (Christian amateurs) on the community theater stage.

I finally had to gong this one. This adaptation failed to deliver and the religious message really destroyed the delivery method.

Look, it does little good to preach if those to whom you preach tune you out. This is why Christians are supposed to ""witness""- not preach. People will listen to the tales, the parables but few want to hear preachy speeches.

Show- don't tell the tale. Let the parable do the work for you.

In that one, his PHYSICAL being was the beast, but his core was in fact also gentle beauty.  In this film, the male lead is perhaps physically attractive, but he is at core - personality over appearance - a wretch.

Belle and the Beast: A Christian Romance uses the Bible as the book for their religion. Beauty and the Beast: A Latter-Day Tale uses the Book of Mormon as the book for their religion - plus it has a few extra clips during the movie.

I think they made ""A Latter-Day Tale"" first and then changed the movie to appeal to a difference audience; and therefore, had to cut a few scenes to put in the bible. It all depends on which one you prefer. The rest of the movie is the same.

I like ""A Latter-Day Tale"" better and will definitely watch it again.  See my review of Beauty and the Beast: A Latter-Day Tale.",1369785600,2,759,4.286713286713287

You could see his progress back to humanity and that made up for some of the other faults.

3373760,4,B00150N8EY,"I genuinely liked this movie because it was just different enough not to be a retread of other Beauty and The Beast movies.  In this one ""The Beast"" is an ordinary business man who is mean, vindictive, & rude and Belle is a nice woman who works part time and goes to college to get a business degree.

The story is pretty typical.  Belle ends up in an agreement where she has to work for ""The Beast"" to save her dad's job, he is the primary wage earner and a widower.  I won't give more plot points or spoilers, but I'm sure you get the gist of the movie.  I do think it is worth your time if you want to watch a good family type of movie.

I think it hit its low point when Eric tells Belle about the horrors of being trapped in a car with his dead wife, praying for her to be alive but knowing she was not.  Belle's response:  ""Some times bad things happen to good people.""  Eric didn't even blink.  He should have thrown her in the lake.  THAT would have improved the movie a lot.

I had no clue what I was getting into with this flick, but it didn't take me long to figure out that this was a Christian film that I could honestly say I truly enjoyed. My goal is to review all of the Christian movies I can find. As I watch them, I always have a critical eye upon them which usually spies out unrealistic or contrived situations/plots, cardboard characters, poor acting, etc, forcing me to deduct style points and feel bad that I can't extol the virtues of the film and recommend it highly to everyone. It feels so good to run across a film with a good Christian message that delighted me all the way around.  I can't believe that this story only got three doves from the Dove Foundation.

Eric comes across initially as a rude and arrogant man, who buries himself in his work to cover the pain of his past loss. Belle's father, because of a careless accident causes Belle to be forced to work for Eric.

Over a period to time, like all things, a fondness starts to develop between Eric and Belle. The plot in this film is not very thick, so to inspire some excitement Belle's young admirer is used to bring in some intrigue.

I give it one star for the movie itself, and another for my amusement.",1285545600,6,524,4.574468085106383
3373831,2,B00150N8EY,"Overall I thought this movie was a very good production with an exciting plot and good acting, but I was disappointed with the Christian aspect. The messages (both subtle and not-so-subtle) conveyed in ""Belle and the Beast"" seemed no different from those conveyed by secular romance films: The woman is perfect as she is and does not need to change; she has unrealistically high standards for a partner; she alone holds the power to change a man; in a healthy relationship, the man does all the work and pursues the woman and placates her until she is satisfied. I am not advocating the traditional model of a relationship in which the the man is the head and the woman a mere submissive puppet; I appreciated Belle's confidence and independence. However, after watching this film which explicitly advertises itself as Christian, I felt as if I had sat through just another secular romance that portrays false ideas about true love.",1275868800,6,932,4.867924528301887

Not preachy at all, but clean and just good all-around.  The acting was perhaps a slight notch below what we're accustomed to, but all in all very acceptable.  This movie is still available at [...] for under [...], so don't despair!",1265068800,67,395,4.213333333333333

I am sucker for love story movies and this one shows what the Love of God can do to someone and the strength it takes to stick around and help that person work on themselves just by showing them love and kindness.",1526947200,,370,4.152777777777778

8256983,1,B00150N8EY,"This is not a fairytale; this is about abusive relationships and what Not to do.
First tell her friend that her cousin is a wako and to stop setting her up with him. If that doesn't work, you need to move on from that friendship.
Second. Tell the Wako Cousin that you're not into him (a lot sooner) and when he shows up at your work; explain to him what a restraining order is and how it works. When he gets your Dad fired; call the police.
Third. Lots of people work for Jerks, but if it gets to the point of grabbing things out of your hands and screaming in your face; leave. Have enough respect for yourself to not let yourself stay in that type of a situation. If he's angry and that aggressive to you on your first day, how do you know he won't do something more drastic. Things like this slowly esculate and when he does something and then tells you he's sorry again and again; THAT'S AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP. Get Out for your own safety!!! Fourth. Your Father should have protected you. Even if he got fired he shouldn't have put you in this situation. He can look for a new job, you get another part time job, even little sister can get a paper route, Most important; FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM???

8256984,5,B00150N8EY,"Yes, yes - it has all the flaws reported by other reviewers here. But it also has that strength: a sweetness and light romance that is getting harder to find in rom-coms made these days.

The first half of the movie does feature some wooden acting and clunky dialogue. Then, it is if you really are there as these people warm up to each other - or should I say that one character begins to thaw from exposure to a warm, accepting, honest person. It is charming with a slow-pace. All this happens amidst gorgeous Utah. What a beautiful, beautiful state, going by what is shown here! The mansion where most of the action takes place seems grand and modest at the same time, if you pick up the Mormon vibe that permeates this film.

I am glad I watched this movie. I can think of a friend who would love it because she's a sucker for feel-good movies, as am I.",1526169600,,857,4.283950617283951
