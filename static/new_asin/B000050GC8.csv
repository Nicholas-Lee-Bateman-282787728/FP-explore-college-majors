1385249,5,B000050GC8,"I was only introduced to Rurouni Kenshin a couple of months ago when I accidentally watched a part of the TV series with a friend of mine.  It is very good anime, great artwork, neat story and fantastic fights.
Samurai X is the OVA version of Rurouni Kenshin.  This second part to the two-disc OVA is really quite good.  I expected more fighting like in the first disc, but the focus here is more on Kenshin and his development as a character (the first part of this dvd has no fighting whatsoever).  In this I was a little bit disappointed: Saitoh and Kenshin have a go at each other, but it is almost an afterthought.  The entire feature is done well, make no mistake, but if you are looking to find 'more of the same' from the first disc, this is not the case.
That said, I enjoyed this immensely.  The sparsity of combat makes it extra special when it shows up, and the character development works very well.  This is very sombre anime, but truly excellent.",976060800,9,961,4.395480225988701
1385250,5,B000050GC8,"The second part and the conclusion to the Rurouni Kenshin OVA's, Not only that the storyline that really srikes a viwers point of view towards what really happened, and to why he killed by the masses, but the soundtrack and instrumentation music that plays in the background that gives this epic a true masterpiece. Recommended for animation lovers that likes drama and action. I give this DVD my full blessing and proper credit of THUMBS UP ALL THE WAY!  NOTE: Subtitled is recommended version.",974332800,2,495,4.892857142857143
1385260,5,B000050GC8,"Prequels for the most part are tricky: they tend to not include fan favorites from the show/movie/book while setting up the backstory of some of the main characters. While the story does include Kenshin(and even Saitoh makes an appearance), the film is missing characters like Kaoru, Sanosuke and Aoshi and our favorite ""oro"" speaking Kenshin is gone. In the show, Kenshin is atoneing for his life as an assassin, so what made him change? This second part answers it, revealing probably one of the most fleshed out and haunted characters in anime.

At the end of the first half, Kenshin and Tomoe had to escape the city when soldiers try to track down everyone in Kenshin's group. Now posing as husband and wife in the countryside, Kenshin starts to become more human and experience a sense of peace he never had. However it's shattered when a truth comes out which will make him lead the life we see in the show.

One thing that many will notice is the explanation of Kenshin's star-shaped scar on his cheek. Most stories just explain it with a simple ""that battle 5 years ago..."" but it usually doesn't amount to nothing but a simple minor annoyance, a wrong place-wrong time kind of thing. How Kenshin got his is a great image and a daily reminder of the catalyst that changed his life.

The film ultimately works because of its imagery. When Kenshin starts imagining crossing a field of bodies, or, in my opinion, one of the most touching images involving Kenshin and Tomoe right at the end, you know this isn't just your run-of-the-mill anime that's either way too fun/violent or just way too confusing and abstract. You notice just how well-done the visuals are and how better they are compared to traditional cinema.

If you're into anime at all, honestly, you have to watch this. Watching this after the show gives a better explanation for how Kenshin is, not to mention it's a great movie.",1154563200,,1898,4.707831325301205
1385261,5,B000050GC8,"Telling fans of the ""Rurouni Kenshin"" series that ""Samurai X: Betrayal,"" the second half of a four-episode anime mini-series is where we find out why Kenshin has that ""X"" shaped scar on his face should be enough to get them to check out this prequel.  The story is set in 19th-century Japan and in the first half, ""Samurai X: Trust,"" Shinta, a young man sold into slavery after his parents died, is trained by the mystic swordsman in Japan to be the most feared assassin in Japan and given the name Kenshin.  When he grows up our young hero meets Tomoe Yukishiro, a mysterious young woman whose fianc had been murdered by Kenshin.
This DVD of ""Romantic Tales from the Meiji Era"" includes ""Act 3: The Previous Night at the Mountain Home"" and ""Act 4: The Cross-Shaped Wound.""  In Act 3 Kenshin tries to live a life of peace that is at odds with his brutal life as he and Tomoe hide out in Otsu, posing as a simple farmer and his wife.  Kenshin even thinks of making the fantasy real, although there does not seem to be any reason for him to fall in love with the mysterious Tomoe, but then the ""traitor"" is revealed to Kenshin, setting up the tragic end game in Act 4.  As the title indicates, this is where we learn how Kenshin received his distinctive wound and the most impressive part of the tale is that writer Nobuhiro Watsuki and director Kazuhiro Furuhashi come up with something that is both surprising and lyrical.  You might have trouble reconciling the contemplative Keshin we see at the end of ""Samurai X"" with the more childlike one of ""Rurouni Kenshin,"" but it is hard to deny the power of this story.
I think watching ""Samurai X"" after enjoying ""Rurouni Kenshin"" is the correct order for viewing, even though it is the prequel to the series.  There are profound differences between the two, with ""Samurai X"" being more sophisticated that the series, with the violence heightened and the comic elements stripped away.  The prequel is not intended for young viewers, even if they are fans of the series, because even though we all know that Kenshin becomes the ""Hitokiri Battousai"" (i.e., ""the man who slashes even as he draws his sword""), his being an assassin constitutes an even darker chapter in his early life.",1086048000,,2227,4.606060606060606
1385262,2,B000050GC8,"Some people say it's much better than the TV series,or it's not that much more violent,there wrong. Samurai X is a whole lot gory than the TV series because in this they show swords going through people's heads,etc. In the TV they don't,so that ends there. Anyone who says this is ok for kids has problems. THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS,that's why it says 17+.
  Personally I like the TV series better,because it's got a better story,and in the TV series it's got better fighting. Let me tell you why,anyone can kill someone with a sword,but it's much different with a reverse-blade sword,with a reverse-blade sword you have to have skill therefore making Kenshin to use better techniques of the Hiten-Mitsurugi style. In samurai X he doesn't do any cool moves,just cut slice,off goes your head.
  If you like gore and not that good and an ok story this is for you. If you like alot of action,awesome moves that you've never seen or thought you'd ever see,no gore(not a whole lot of blood),and an awesome story the Rurouni Kenshin TV series is for you.
  2 stars for the story & art,that's all.",1079654400,2,1085,4.595854922279793
1385263,4,B000050GC8,"If you like Kenshin, you will like this DVD.  It is, however, quite different than the t.v. series.  First, the animation is quite a bit better.  Second, there is none of the silliness of the series.  This is 100 percent serious, which may be good or bad, depending upon if you like some of the foolishness of the series.  I felt like Kenshin loses some of his appeal in this by being too serious, although the series could perhaps tone down SOME of the silliness. Third, the characters are never quite developed in this movie (although they are more Asian-looking. I never understand why Japanese anime heroes always look more American than me, but the villains always seem to still look Japanese. Is this a Japanese ideal?)  In the series, we see Kenshin's struggle and turmoil, but in the movie he is basically portayed rather one dimensional and flat until the sees the errors of his ways. Finally, while everyone else seems to think it was violent, I don't find it that much more violent than the t.v. series.  I personally don't have a problem with my children watching it, because it's animation and loses the edge that reality violence has.
The main problem I see with this movie, and not to give anything away, is that I had trouble figuring out why Kenshin and Tomoe fell in love to begin with, because there was nothing overly interesting or particularly redeeming in their personalities to spark a romance.  While the Kenshin in the t.v. series is quite lovable and adorable, the movie version of Kenshin is a little bland and not as personable or caring. The relationship does explain, however, why he might be a little shell shocked about falling in love again, and why he is so hesitant to fall in love with Kaoru in the series.  If you like Kenshin, you will want to have these blanks filled in, as the first two movies fill the gaps of what happened to Kenshin to make him what he is in the series.
  The reason I give this only four of five stars is because if you are not a Kenshin fan, you will not appreciate the movie.  It is SLOOOOOW moving for the most part, almost painfully so in some parts, (in fact I thought my DVD player had stopped during one scene), and if you are not familiar with Kenshin the man from the series, it is doubtful you will appreciate or understand his character. People I watched the movie with who had not seen the series did not think the movie was very good, and could not figure out why I like Kenshin so much to begin with.
  I would recommend this if you are a Kenshin fan, and you have any desire to find out about his first love, how he got the famous X-shaped scar, what made him decide to become the manslayer, what made him decide he needed redemption, and how he almost found it prior to his meeting Kaoru. If you are not a Kenshin fan, I wouldn't buy the movie, but maybe start with the series. Buy one DVD with three episodes and I can almost guarantee you will be HOOKED.",1073433600,10,2935,4.421150278293135
1385264,3,B000050GC8,"REVIEW MADE FOR THOSE WHO ARE ENGLISH AND ONLY KNOW A FEW JAPANESE WORDS (sakabatao, rurouni, etc) AND WHO HAVE SEEN THE SERIES FIRST!!!!
This OVA was very disapointing to me for a number of reasons. 1.)The voices are different from the series  2.)the animation is different from the series 3.) The dialogue is poor, drags on and sounds corny  4.)Kenshin is really really serious and, although he is in a lot of pain, even in the manga he joked around and was like he is in the series.
Basically those are all things that i could get past but unfortunately, the way that the story is caried out is the most depressing.  It is such an excellent story that should really effect u and be very emotional.  The story falls short of capturing the viewer by not giving the full effect on the characters, having poor, underdone voice acting, and being just plain confusing.  It seems that the series was able to make u feel closer to the characters and gives them a more personal aspect.  This OVA fails to do that and doesnt quite grasp the sheer verocity of the tale.
On the other hand it is very interesting to finally discover the real meaning of the scar on kenshins left cheek and to find out who Tomoe was, her presence only hinted at in the series.  The same things apply to the ""Reflections"" OVA, which seems to have the same talents as well as faults.
I recommend seeing it but i will not rave about it.  I think that it would have been better if it was the same style as the series (flashbacks in the series clearly show that) but its worth it just the same.",1061164800,,1561,4.358620689655172

1385266,5,B000050GC8,"I highly reccomend this movie. I watched it 5 times during these last 2 days and i cried every time i watched it. It made me feel sorry for Kenshin and think about him in the future. In this movie,the only time he seemed happy was with Tomoe but all the other scenes,he always seemed sad. That's what made me cry too. But now that I see him in the future,he seems happy all the time with Kauro,Yahiko,Megumi,and Sanoske and that's a good thing.

1385270,5,B000050GC8,"This DVD contains the last two episodes of the Samurai X OVA, completing the prequel to the long running and justifiably popular Rurouni Kenshin series.  These are set in the period leading up to the overthrow of the Shogunate and are a historical drama that tells the tale of one of the periods most deadly assassins, and a hero of the Meijin restoration.  What happened in this story created the myth of a wandering samurai who fought for the people, and refused to use his sword to kill.
The first episode here, ""The Previous Night at the Mountain Home"" is a complete contrast to the episodes of the previous DVD.  It picks up the threads of the relationship between Kenshin Himura and Tomoe as they live in exile.  Exquisitely slowly, Tomoe finds herself growing deeply in love with the man who killed her fianc.  And Kenshin, emotionally distant as an assassin finds that rural life with Tomoe is teaching him the lessons about the value of life that his sword master was never able to explain to him.
The final episode, ""The Cross-Shaped Wound,"" brings this phase of Kenshin's life to its inevitable conclusion.  When an assassin struggles with the meaning of his life, tragedy must ensue.  Kenshin faces a last attempt on his life hampered by his doubts.  Sworn to protect Tomoe, she protects him instead, completing the second cut of his scar, and starting the painful healing process.
Delicate film values mark these episodes, which repeatedly echo the illustrations of Japan's contemporary artists, while the formal dialog evokes classical Noh drama.  All of this is carefully balances by scenes of extreme violence.  Strangely evocative of Kurosawa's style.  After going through the episodes multiple times, I have become convinced that this is one of those rare cases where the dubbing comes closer to the essence of the Japanese than do the subtitles.  This is quite a victory for Lowell Bartholomee, since writers of English language scripts for anime are not noted for successes.",1047513600,10,1994,4.937125748502994
1385271,2,B000050GC8,"I am one of those people that have seen much anime out there. I tend too import my anime rather then wait for a commercial release of it.  The Kenshin OVA, the prior title too Samurai X before ADV laid thier misbegotten hands on the liscense, was one of those titles.  A story of Brutal moments and tradgedy.  Natural flowing dialouge telling a compelling story about kenshin's fall from grace, It was A story of tremendous depth, impact, and sadness.  With few jokes, buckets of bloodshed, And A complex story about justice, redemption, vengence, and heartache.  It made me an instant fan of himura kenshin.
Im sorry too say that the domestic release has suffered greatly in the trip too our shores.  ADV has seen fit too change much of the story.  I can see your average anime fan, weened on pokemon and sailor moon scratching thier head at this.  But those of us that remember anime greats like macross, cowboy bebop, And the original gundam series, respect Anime's tendency too give us some of the deepest and stirring tales ever put too paper, and animating them with far more emotional impact then live action could ever stir.  ADV failed too grasp this.  Tomoe has been changed from a weak, torn woman.  Too a lovesick vamp.  Enishi, Who was A Frighteningly Angry 12 year old boy in the original story, is arrogant and annoying.  Seito hajime, a Great swordsman, Is the leader of the shinsengumi in ADV's version.  In the original tale he is leader of the THIRD squad, his superior is a 15 year old swordsman.  This and more make me Very angry because I loved the first Rouruni Kenshin OVA so dearly.  It became one of my favorite DVD's.  This is a mockery of a Great tale.  Dumbed down for ignorant masses.  For all those that liked this tale, I implore you too find a way to view the original japansese telling, or watch this with a friend that speaks japanese.
Im happy too report that ADV mercifully did not edit any of the violence or terrific musical score.  The animation is lovely, whether it is showing a countryside at sunset, a sentimental flashback, or a grusome battle with blood flowing with ever slash of the sword.  The music is equally as Evocative.  Its a shame that ADV had too rob Anime viewers of such a robust and complex tale.  This is the beginning of Himura Kenshin's Quest for Atonement.  One that continues throughout the TV series, And Concludes with the forthcoming Seisouhen OVA... where the final fate of kenshin is revealed.  It is a long and epic tale, that began with the First Kenshin OVA.  It was animated After the TV series became popular in japan... As a sort of Episode one That SO did not suck.  Until ADV tampered with it.
Kenshin Fans that have seen this DVD without ADV monkeying with it all agree that ADV made a grusome mistake in what they did.  This series is so beloved by its fans, and rightly so.  It deserved so much better.  In ADV's Defense, I will Say that ""Samurai X, Trust and Betrayal"" Beats pokemon, sailor moon, gundam wing, and most other anime out there all hollow.  But The Original Kenshin OVA, was simply the best.  Period.  Find some way too experiance it, and Im sure you will agree.",1046649600,2,3157,4.550621669626998

1385274,5,B000050GC8,"This DVD presents the last two episodes (30 minutes each) of the Rurouni Kenshin OVA (miniseries), not to be confused with the theatrical film or the main television series.
This DVD (and its companion, Trust), presents the backstory of Kenshin Himura (hero of the RuroKen series), during the years of the Imperialist Revolution against the Tokugawa Shoganate (i.e., more than 8 years before the start of the main series).
This particular DVD tells of how the Imperialist assassin, Kenshin Himura, becomes a simple farmer of a small town, while hiding from the Shogunate soldiers who are tracking down the scattered rebel forces. The first (3rd) episode is very tranquil and pastoral (aside from some brief establishing flashback sequences), and shows how Kenshin slowly heals his soul, living with Tomoe as husband and wife, first as merely a cover (they don't share the same bed), and then later as reality. It is extremely romantic and tasteful; the one love scene is very moving and understated, and contains no obvious nudity. The second (4th, final) episode shows how a betrayal within the rebel forces puts Kenshin and Tomoe into extreme danger; and explains why Kenshin has an cross-shaped scar on his left cheek. It also explains why he chooses to become a wanderer after the end of the rebellion, leaving behind forever (he hopes) the sword of a killer. There is more action in this last episode than in the first three put together, and I found it to complete the story very satisfactorily, on many emotional levels.
The OVA is very different in style and tone from the main series; subjectively, I can't decide whether it's better or worse (the two stylistic presentations are intended for two different target audiences, I think, and both do their distinctive jobs very well). Objectively, the animation is more detailed, nuanced and realistic. Music and sound are at the same high standard (by the same composer, too, I think), but obviously more tragic and epic and even understated than what is sometimes found in the main series.
These two DVDs (Trust and Betrayal) stand well together as an independent storyline (it's not necessary to know, or be a fan of, the main series); and in some not-insignificant ways, the film is better than the comparable live-action American Revolutionary War movie _The Patriot_. There are high standards of realism to the film--no hyper-jumps, or vacuum-slinging swords, but merely extremely realistic swordfighting.
The violence level is very high, particularly in the second episode of this disc, though not overall as in-your-face brutal as the first episode of the first disc; but it is in keeping with the central point to the film, which is that no matter how necessary killing may sometimes be, it is still a tragedy which threatens to turn the killer (even with the best of intentions) into a monster. Like many of the best oriental fighting-movies (and like the main series upon which the OVA story is based), the underlying message is actually rather anti-violent. Language is roughly PG-13 material.
DVD production values are competent, though nothing particularly special. English dubbing is very good, and subtitling makes good sense; both are distinctive enough to be worth going through each, but overall I prefer the dubbing. Not being familiar with the Japanese language, I can't gauge how accurate they are to the original, but they fit what's shown very well.
It's difficult to recommend when a fan of the main series should watch this. Fans should definitely get it, but it does contain many 'spoilers' about the history of Kenshin. The best time might be after season two of the series.",1038787200,4,3657,5.026359143327842

1385277,5,B000050GC8,"Short Version - ""Betrayal"" is part 2 of the two part Rurouni Kenshin OAVs and it chronicles Kenshin's gradual emergence from his shell of sadness. This is the better half of this stunning series, and is both a masterpiece and an absolute must-see.
Long Version - Once again, an easy five star rating. Since the American distributors not only decided to rename Rurouni Kenshin but also to sell the OAVs as two separate DVDs, I have to write two reviews. In my review for ""Trust"" (part 1 & the 1st DVD) I already covered many aspects of this OAV series which do not need to be rereviewed here. So instead, I'll take note of any differences that existed between the two DVDs.
Plot: In part 1, Himura Kenshin, famed and feared shadow assassin of the Ishin Shishi, has already laid the foundation of ""Trust"" which becomes the pivotal center of his ""Betrayal"". The only question thus becomes ""Who is the Judas (infamous betrayer of Jesus in the Bible)?"" By the end of DVD 1, Kenshin's life is in grave danger, so he and Tomoe are spirited away to a remote village in Otsu with Tomoe, the woman he met outside a tavern in Kyoto. Posing as a humble married medicine man, Kenshin finds peace for the first time in his short fifteen years. But as with all good things, the calm he comes to share with Tomoe is soon shattered. Watch this DVD to bear witness to the heart-pounding climax and the final unveiling of the legacy of hatred and sacrifice behind Kenshin's famous cross-shaped scar. A solid and engrossing plot that often moved me to tears. 5/5
Pacing: As with the first DVD, the pacing of the story in ""Betrayal"" is appropriate and gripping. Fortunately, there is more packed into the second half of the Memorial Arc, so the pace picks up a little by the end of Ep. 3, and the rest of the DVD is pure magic. No needless ""dragging-on"" to be found here. 5/5
Animation: As with part 1, I had the same qualms with the animation. Although admittedly fluid and often lovely to look at, the people still look drugged, the foregrounds still bleed into the backgrounds, and, amazingly enough, the blood has changed shades half-way through the OAV series. Whereas in the first DVD, the blood had a realisitic coloring, part 2 has some bright orange-ish splashing. A minor thing, true, but it does make it rather awkward to feel the expected sorrow and horror when the people look like they're being doused in V8 vegetable drink. 3.5/5
Music: Obviously, the same soundtrack is used for part 2 as in part 1. The only note I can make here is that to notice the originality of this anime series. Different from other action series, the music is used here to both support and offset the storyline. If this is confusing, picture hearing gentle piano music in the background as Kenshin is fighting. Or hearing nothing at all when you would normally expect to hear something. This seamless juxtaposition makes each the music and story all the more excellent. I cannot say this enough: ""BUY THIS SOUNDTRACK!!"" Every emotion is brought to the surface with a beginning to end listen: happiness, sadness, and every range of feeling in between that can be given no words. Again, there is no J-pop anywhere on this soundtrack. But not to despair - the orchestral sound is heavenly in and of itself, and no doubt, holds the power to convert many anti-classical people into fans of the genre. Quiet piano solo tracks are combined with pounding full orchestral suites - this CD can be fully enjoyed with or without having watched the anime it was meant to accompany. Without question 5/5
Accuracy: Unlike ""Trust"", the less-than-faithful retelling of the original story from the manga can be readily noticed here. However, the changes made are obviously in the interest of simplifying the tale for viewers new to Kenshin, and are overlookable. Could have been better though. 4/5
Voice Acting (seiyuu): Once again, the voice acting in Japanese is superb. The simultaneous restraint and emotion in the voices of the actors is amazing to the ear. The dubbing is notable, although not top-notch. As with most animes, it's best to stick with the original voice-overs with this DVD. 5/5
OVERALL: Once the scores are averaged, we get an almost perfect score, which I round up to a five. ""Trust"" had its flaws, as does this half of the series, but in all the little ways that count, this DVD is slightly better. Certainly a more deserving five. But one is not useful without its partner, and I recommend purchasing both and experiencing the magic for yourself. Both DVDs are strong, and this OAV is as touching and wondrous as it is groundbreaking. Rurouni Kenshin has one of the best track records in Japan for the '90s as a hit manga/anime series - watch ""Trust"" and ""Betrayal"" to find out precisely why!",1031011200,4,4769,4.678571428571429

I'm just here to help you make the decision. So I'll just skip right to the point: this is the most beatiful piece of animation I have ever seen. Even though the animation doesn't resemble that of the Rurouni Kenshin tv-series I can assure you that once you start watching it, that won't bother you a bit. The OAV is a lot more serious than the tv-series, as it is about Kenshin's past. It masterfully captures the feelings of the people in it and it really helps you understand Kenshin and his actions. I wasn't able to take my eyes off the screen during the four episodes, because you get to witness such awesome fight scenes and experience such strong feelings(especially in the end).
The only recommendation I have is tfor you to watch it with the Japanese voices and english subtitles, since the english voice acting really is nothing compared to that of the Japanese, they truly put their heart and soul into it.

1385294,5,B000050GC8,"Whether you are an anime fan or not, the OVA series, Samurai X Trust (part I) and Betrayal (part II) are storytelling and cinema at their finest. The promise of Trust is completely fulfilled by Betrayal. All of the top-notch qualities that made the first set of episodes stand out (beautifully animated visuals, compelling characters, engaging story, etc.) is wrapped up in this last half as Kenshin, the assassin and Tomoe, a mysterious girl he rescued, barely escape Kyoto with their lives.
The third episode takes place while Tomoe and Kenshin hide out in remote Otsu, posing as husband and wife. The compassion and kindness that the viewer knows Kenshin possesses comes out as he happily adapts to a new life as a farmer and husband. For Tomoe it is a revelation since the only Kenshin she knows is that of an assassin, a murderer who brings the bloody rain. Her feelings for Kenshin become confused as she struggles with the reality that the peaceful husband she knows now also killed her fiance, her first love. She asks herself, ""The first gift you gave me was death. How shall I repay you?"" Their precarious peace is about to be shattered by the unexpected arrival of Tomoe's brother, who has news he thinks will bring Tomoe great happiness.
Episode four brings us to the stunning conclusion of Kenshin's story of which episode three was but a brief interlude. Tomoe has confessed her secrets, though not that Kenshin himself was the one who killed her fiance. She has also admitted to herself, and to Kenshin, that she loves him. As fate would have it, the traitor suspected in Trust is actively working to bring down Kenshin for his crimes and the bucolic interlude in the mountains has played directly into his hands. As Tomoe realizes, ""My love for you will not be enough to save you from the consequences of your actions.""
His tragic story plays out in an inevitable chain of events that will leave you heartbroken but strangely satisfied. In the end many questions will be answered, including the outcome of the battle between Tomoe's love and her desire for revenge, Kenshin's struggle between the killer he has become and the protector he could be, and most importantly how he wins the other half of his cross-shaped scar(which comes only at great cost to himself and others).

1385299,5,B000050GC8,"Well, it's my favorite . . . as a historical drama, classically Japanese-styled film, and an action anime, the Rurouni Kenshin OAV is certainly the best example of the anime OAV format I've ever seen.
This 4 episode mini-series, for me, stands well on its own apart from the Rurouni Kenshin TV series' Kyoto Arc, though many of the finer details are better appreciated by fans who've seen the TV show already.  I feel that these four episodes should have been a single film--if it were, I think it would stand proudly alongside the classic live-action Japanese samurai films of Kurosawa and other directors.  For one, the script is nuanced, poetic, and filled with evocative Japanese flower metaphors, and it tells a simple, tragic story that honestly could have come from Shakespere or any other classic drama.  The animation, particularly in the sword duels and fight choreography, is stunningly fluid (though bloody).  The depictions of the pre-industrial Japanese landscape achieves a level of detail and vividness seen only in the very best of Miyazaki's work, such as Princess Mononoke.  Visual symbolism abounds as well, complementing the literate script.  And I must mention the score: alternately deeply melancholy, intense, thrilling, and romantic, it accompanies the scenes perfectly and stands as wonderful music on its own.  It's the best score not written by Yoko Kanno I've heard in any anime.  The acting on the original Japanese vocals stands out for its emotional restraint tinged with heartfelt sorrow--Kenshin and Tomoe's voice actresses in particular do a great job.  (The dub in English is not nearly as good: changes have been made to the script, the voices are often woefully inappropriate, and everything is usually overacted in the typical American fashion.  Avoid at all costs.)
Above all else, the story deeply moved me, in finding out how horrible a childhood the laughing, contented adult Kenshin of the TV series came from.  In fact, the main problem with this OAV is that it so completely overshadows the TV series.  If you start with this OAV and then move on to the TV show, you'll almost sure to be disappointed--the TV show, while often funny and lighthearted, never quite achieves the weight and significance that this OAV strives for and fully accomplishes.
This OAV is an example of anime as genuine Japanese cinema in the tradition of Ozu, Kurosawa, and others.  Recommended for all, except for young vieweres as the violence is graphic and the mood unrelentingly grim--though it never feels exploitive or self-consciously gloomy.  Rurounki Kenshin OAV is a work of true art.",1011916800,10,2615,5.079439252336448
1385300,5,B000050GC8,"Betrayal, the 3rd and 4th episodes in the Rurouni Kenshin OAV, was masterfully done.  The animation quality is far better than the Rurouni Kenshin series, obviously.  The music is beautiful, and the voice acting is excellent.  When I refer to voice acting, I am assuming that you are watching the Japanese version with subtitles--English dubs on Anime are bad, and sometimes they reach a point of being offensive due to the sheer inexpereince of the voice actors.
After seeing trust, I was expecting more assassinations; I was pleasantly surprised to find that the killing stopped... For a while, anyway.  The first episode is Kenshin and Tomoe getting closer, while Tomoe seems to be considering something, something very dark.  The cold assassin, Kenshin the Hitokiri Battousai (a nickname he was given for being such a good assassin), eventually grows to love Tomoe.  The last episode brings a closure to the OAV masterfully. This DvD is worth every penny, and I have already watched it multiple times.
(Note to parents) Although Betrayal, and Trust, are masterpeices, like many things, I would not suggest this be viewed by children, due sexual referances, graphic violence, and a sex scene.  I would not suggest this DvD as a present to your little ones.",1011052800,3,1259,5.024038461538462
1385301,4,B000050GC8,"Well, let me start by saying that I first saw Rurouni Kenshin back in 1997. This was back before the storyline presented in these OAVs was even completely written in manga format, so I have a somewhat unique view of these episodes (as compared to someone who has only been recently introduced to it).
The story and format in these episodes is excellant. It's very different from the TV series, and even the original manga telling of this story arc. It's extremely serious, with a more realistic animation style to it. The musical is classical, and in my opinion is beautiful. The story is (as always with Rurouni Kenshin)driving and action packed, with a good plot. Although I, personally, would have liked to have seen these episodes done in the same format as the TV episodes, or atleast something similar to that of the original comic books/manga, I was very pleased with the OAVs.
The translation itself is pretty decent. The dubbed voices are not too unbearable. (As compared to the TV series ones, which make my ears bleed. Keep in mind, I'm a purist when it comes to these things.) My one MAJOR problem with the translation is the title from ""Rurouni Kenshin"" to ""Samurai X"" A samurai is the OPPOSITE of what a rurouni, or a masterless wandering swordsman, is, being that a samurai has a lord who he serves.
If you are looking for an action packed serious samurai anime, this is definitely the choice for you. If you're a purist like myself, I recommend you reverse the cover on the DVD to the ""Rurouni Kenshin"" side, and watch it subtitled.",1010016000,3,1548,4.653284671532846

1385308,3,B000050GC8,"There is one, sharp difference between Betrayal and Trust; Betrayal implements computer generated and real life images into the animation. In my opinion, these chafe like old rope again soft skin. If you watch Trust and Betrayal back to back, it is almost comical, as if the animators grew too tired to draw things that had been in previous episodes. This presence seriously detracts from episode 3, but dissipates early on, in the final episode.
The actual animation is consistent with Trust, when not interrupted by CGI, is beautiful. The animation is supported by fine voice acting (though there are always faults to be found with English dubbing), and a steady, at times breathtaking score.
The love story that developed in ""Trust"" bleeds in ""Betrayal,"" but to soften any tears one might shed over these acts, there are two quite bloody sequences sandwiched with the tragedy (and considering the title of the DVD, I don't consider that a spoiler), and the revelation of the cross-shaped scar on Kenshin's cheek.
After having seen all four episodes (or ""Acts""), one can seriously doubt Kenshin's likelihood to have become the subservient houseboy of Kaoru's dojo. It is that schism that causes fans to define themselves as admirers of the OVA or TV series. Personally, I enjoyed both, however, I have a warning for lovers of the TV series. Kenshin devotes his life to paying penance for his sins; the OVA reveals his darkest sin. No 'oro's' or cow-towing to dojo mistresses here, this is the story of the Battousai's birth; a bittersweet love story and infrequent scenes of ultraviolence.

But what the last two installment does is create a believable situation to the tragic and heart-rending tragedy of Himura. There is a noticeable introduction of CG elements in here, but it comes across as akward, especially with the melding of real-time sea-water and animated cels. Thankfully, this process is only done briefly, and does not hamper the overall visuial feel of series. The animation is solid, and the combat scenes of the last episode are so good that one can almost forgive the overtly violent scenes from the last two.

1385315,5,B000050GC8,"The translator of this series says in his notes on the disc that this series is much the same to anime as Kurosawa Akira was to Japanese filmmaking.  I find it hard to disagree as both draw from many of the same themes and styles.
The series, known to the rest of anime fandom as the ""Rurouni Kenshin"" OAV series, tells the background of the series hero Himura Kenshin who is a major (fictional) source behind the civil war at the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate in the late 1860s to early 1880s.  By the time we meet him in the TV Series, he is a wanderer who is dedicated to peace and has a past of incredible violence that he can never seem to completely live down.  This series tells the back story for Kenshin.  This disc is the second (of two) in his story.
Many themes of classical Japanese literature and film are found in the OAV Series - and especially in this disc - and the pace of it is highly evocative of movies like ""Ran"" and ""Gonza the Spearman"".  The art is simply incredible - and done in large part with computer-generated animation.  In many ways, the animation style is much like the early episodes of ""Serial Experiments Lain"" with a much brighter feel.  The muscial score is lovely and does a surprisingly good job a steering clear of J-Pop like that which is found in the TV Series.  While not totally classically Japanese, it fits well with the story - which is not totally classically Japanese either.
There are many reminders that the series is not a complete throwback to classic Japanese cinema.  The romance, while maintaining a very classical twist, owes much to modern anime melodrama.  The action sequences, while very impressive, are very indicative of what one finds in anime of the last five to ten years - not cinema of half a century ago.  Likewise, the almost seemingly airbrushed images of fire, waves and falling blossoms give a modern anchor to this tale.
On the whole, almost nothing to fault in the series.  It is simply a masterpiece of animation and can rightly be ranked with critically acclaimed pieces by Miyazaki and Ishii as well as cinematic works of filmmakers like Kurosawa.  You do not need to have seen the TV Series to follow the plot and, in some cases, may find it a hindrance.

Yes, there are a FEW minor flaws, but any review that rambles about the horrors of these two works are just outright wrong, so take heart.  Second, if you're a fan of the Rurouni Kenshin television series, although these tell Kenshin's backstory, it is presented in a remarkably different manner.  The tv show was for kids.  I found it mostly enjoyable, but you have to be able to suspend your disbelief with the stalwart mindset of a child.  It just isn't realistic, not to mention it can't go more than thirty seconds without some childish joke or swirly eyes or other such nonsense.  This is a story for adults.  Not just for the grim mood and bloody scenes, but the subtlety (that probably isn't spelled right) of the story and voice acting (skip the next paragraph for more on that).  Be warned.

Now to correct some misconceptions (the review is in the next paragraph).  I mostly write this as disambiguity; I love this story too much to let so many mindless spartans warn anyone off of it.  I've read that the animation is crappy.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  Every frame shows the detail the artists put into making it.  Colors are full, movement is realistic (especially intricate hand movements during sword play), and they even give visual clues to help you understand when the time frame has changed (the movie does a lot of recollecting a past experience, so it can be a little tricky the first time you see it to know when it is).  I've read that the fight scenes are poorly represented.  $%#$&^$$^$>?  I don't know what world these people live in.  It's a movie for adults.  No super ultra faster-than-light secret attacks here.  No announcing what the name of your next technique will be.  Kenshin is a very skilled assassin using a secret school of swordsmanship.  You can expect that to mean: efficiency of motion, elegance in stance and technique, and quick deaths if he's successful, but at the end of the day it's still a normal person swinging a normal sword in a humanly possible way.  Btw, the animation is extremely accurate in stance and rhythm of actual sword fighting.  There are many complaints about the plot being boring, but I guess people don't enjoy qualities in movies like character growth?  *Who needs to learn from what they've done?  Just keep killing people!  NOW!*  These same people also don't understand the subtlety of voice acting aimed at ages 8+.  Expressing emotion is done in more ways than yelling and waving your hands in the air, and in this work they choose very quiet ways of doing so.  (Did I mention it's for adults?)  Also, many commentators very freely misstate the facts of the movies (such as Saito being the leader of the Shinsengumi, when he is CLEARLY designated the leader of the 3rd squad).  Also complaints about the characters are very common, either that they don't have the characters from the tv show or that they don't like the personalities.  1)It's a prequel folks...KENSHIN DIDN'T KNOW THE TV CHARACTERS WHEN THE SERIES BEGAN!  2)Being a very serious movie, you don't see Hiko being an egomaniac grandstander, Kenshin saying oro after growing a lump on his head, or Saito making fun of other characters.  Hiko is a serious instructor/swordsman who practices the principles his style teaches and spends his free time philosophising on death, a very morbid subject.  Kenshin is an adolescent with a huge talent and desire to save the people of Japan from oppression, but is facing internal conflicts on the right way to do so.  Saito is a leader representing the Shogunate, responsible for quelling a rebellion.  If you bother to examine the personalities and their positions, you might just detect a theme *dun dun dunnnnnnnnn*.

As for an actual review, I would give this piece the highest praise possible.  The first time I saw it I was immediately hooked by the action, being a fan of feudal Japan.  I didn't really get what was going on about 30-45% of the time because of the frequent flashbacks, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  I also happen to be a fan of movies you can watch a zillion times and still get something new out of it, and this fits the bill.  As you learn more about symbolism, particularly how it might apply to seasons, foliage, and color pallats, you get more out of it.  Sometimes it might be a different interpretation of the dialogue, or pick up on an inflection or facial expression you hadn't noticed/figured out before, or perhaps viewing the events through the perspective of a different character, but there are so many deeper things to get out of this visual treat.  And, if you are a big Rurouni Kenshin buff, you can get a few things out of it you might not otherwise (try watching it and bearing in mind that Saito may have been the chief spy for the Shinsengumi, and was intentionally a lower rank than he might otherwise be).  However, after seeing this, you will be forced to admit the utter tomfoolery of the television series...just saying.  The only reason I give it four stars is (unless I'm just slow) because if you only watch it once or twice, you probably won't have a clear understanding of the timeline.  Generally you'll understand what happened when, but about 10-15% of it will still be kind of hazy.  Still tremendously enjoyable, but with a little room for growth.  (Also, I figure if I give it 4 stars the review is more likely to be notices, and therefore helpful).",1309651200,2,5593,4.686153846153847
