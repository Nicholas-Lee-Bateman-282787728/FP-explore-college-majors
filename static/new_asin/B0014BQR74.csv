He was impatient with his students and looked as though it pained him to have to repeat himself when giving instructions in a cooking class, or to have to answer their questions.  I was surprised and disappointed with his attitude and behavior because he's supposed to be a monk.  But, the only time he behaved in any way remotely like you would expect a Zen Buddhist Monk to behave was when he was being interviewed in his garb and sitting in what looked like his personal meditation room.  Basically you feel like you're watching 2 different people who happen to look exactly alike.  The video provided very little actual education and was just an exercise in watching this arrogant individual spew his thoughts.

Famed cookbook author Edward Espe Brown takes the old adage ""You are what you eat"" to a whole new level.  For this master chef/Zen priest believes you must actually become ""one"" with your food (and, as it turns out, with your utensils as well) if you are to ever attain true wholeness of body and spirit in this life.  Brown has been conducting courses on how to combine the art of meditation with the art of cooking for decades now, and the documentary ""How to Cook Your Life"" by German filmmaker Doris Dorrie (who went on to make the superb Zen-flavored drama ""Cherry Blossoms"" a year later) enrolls us in one of those courses - though we don`t get any actual credit for the class and, what's worse, we don`t get to sample any of the food.

Food for Brown has become a way of life - a spiritual and religious experience, as it were, a means of nurturing the soul as well as the body, of becoming one with nature.  And the more organic and less processed that food is the better.

Brown spends much of the time in the course dispensing words of wisdom on how to live life in greater harmony with the world around us, with food and cooking as the primary means of achieving that goal (let it be noted that the seminar takes place in a beautiful bucolic center in rural California).  And if the philosophizing gets to be a bit too much for you after awhile - as it did for me - and Brown seems more like a self-aggrandizing drama queen than an enlightened master at times (the crying over a teapot - and not even a broken one at that - is a bit much), you can at least savor all the tasty morsels that have been lovingly arrayed for our delectation.

Though, come to think of it, with his endless chatter and ceaseless pontificating, Brown puts us in mind of yet another popular expression:  ""How about a little less gab and a little more grub?""",1282953600,5,1851,4.326589595375722
3128393,2,B0014BQR74,"I started watching this video thinking it would have insights on harmonious, healthy eating.  The focus here, Edward Epse Brown, says when he was 10 years old, his aunt cooked him fresh baked bread, and it floored him- so much better than the packaged white breads and paper-like wheat bread.  He wondered how did society get to this state?  And then he becomes a pastry chef for a Buddhist monastery??  White flour is devoid of any nutritional value, throwing away most of the nutritional parts of wheat.  Anyways he is either genetically paunchy, or he has been eating too much white flour, sugar, and dairy.  He even mocks ""the macrobiotic"" buddhists who chew brown rice 50 times and eschew sugary foods, like raisins.  His students bake a lot of pastries, pizzas, white bread, etc.  So his way of eating and cooking just seems so against a zen way of living, especially if you're going to ask what went wrong with society (I checked the table of contents of his bread book: muffins, cookies, pastries, butters, pancakes).  We are too ingrained in the values of our society to escape it, just like all the health food stores where aisle after aisle, all you see are gluten-free cookies, packaged cereals, veggie burgers, etc.- still trying to satisfy those values.",1278201600,8,1267,4.8018433179723505

The philosophy is simple: pay attention to what you're doing, and be in the moment. He authored a book on making bread, which I bought in the 60's. If you want a video that makes you appreciate the simplicity of life, this is it. (He teaches cooking skills with a chef's knife, but I'm not there yet!)",1269388800,3,475,4.288888888888889
3128395,1,B0014BQR74,"How to Cook Your Life (Doris Dorrie, 2007)

Checked this out because I was hoping for a decent cooking documentary. Once again, I was instead handed evidence that there is, in fact, no such thing as a decent cooking documentary. While this isn't as outright awful as I Like Killing Flies, it's definitely a case of ""religion screws up something that might have otherwise been interesting"". Which is actually worse in some ways.

How to Cook Your Life is a glimpse into the world of Edward Espe Brown, author of The Tassajara Bread Book and The Tassajara Recipe Book. I've had both on my list of stuff to read for years, so when I saw a documentary of the author pop up, it immediately went onto the list. I got round to watching it last night, and of the documentary's ninety-four minutes, roughly six were devoted to cooking. Dorrie (Ich und Er) is far more interested in exploring Brown's religious, political, and social values, none of which have a bloody thing to do with cooking, and none of which are in any way interesting. There are a few digressions into the religious/social/political beliefs of close friends and attendees of Brown's cooking classes which are marginally more interesting. But not much.

What saves this from the same zero-star fate to which I Like Killing Flies was destined is that Brown himself seems like an affable sort. He means well, at least, even if (assuming Dorrie's account is in any way accurate) he seems singularly ineffective at getting anything across about the actual art of cooking, heading often into digressions about religion/politics/etc. etc. ad nauseam.  Not the worst thing I saw this weekend, but missed the title by a hair. *",1263600000,10,1681,4.806228373702422
3128396,5,B0014BQR74,"Looking at your life and the experiences you have everyday in terms of the kitchen really helped me to switch some of my views and habits. I used to look at cooking, working and doing the many things I do everyday as one endless, thankless task.

3128399,5,B0014BQR74,"This movie, featuring Zen priest who is also a master cook is not a ""how to cook a dish"" type of movie. Actually it never shows how to prepare a single dish from the begining to the end, but how to work with our own minds. Zen teachings and commentaries are given by Edward Espe Brown (the priest), but also we have archival footage of the teachings of the Zen Master Suzuki,and also the interviews with the members of the Buddhist community.

Zen is a practice of mindfulness, and of course, there is a lot of it in this movie. But also are other aspects which are so very Zen: honesty, humor, poetry, humanity, compassion toward humans and animals, and the attitude toward the problems in our lives. Brown is a priest and a teacher, but he is has not a stature of a Zen master, yet anyone can see how much it can be learned from a practitioner who spend fourty years practicing Zen. And for those of you who like Dalai Lama and his sense of humor,there is also something charming about the brand of humor represented by Brown, and his master teacher, Suzuki.

Cooking was very important practice in Zen monasteries, but also any work done, and this movies shows how much meaning any work can have. Any work which serves the others can be elevated to a meaningful activity, and yes, be holly to some extend, if done with the right spirit.

And I just want to add a comment fro those who are not familiar with Mahayana Buddhism (to which Zen belongs). You can see Brown talking about old water kettles, and there is a lot of down to Earth poetry in it. But he also sheds a tear, so, why is he so emotional, someone may ask. As a long time practitioner, Ed Brown must have to take Boddhistava vows, which means such a practitioner has the attitude the others first. The vows are that the practitioner will by his/her own will be reincarnated again and again in order to help others, postponing his/her own ultimate state of Nirvana.

This is very courageous and compassionate decision, based on deep love to others. And of course, the meaning of service to others is very much extended, and felt very deeply. So, it is not a self pity, but an overwhelming emotion which came upon him. We could have a priviledge to witness this moment.

I recommend this movie not only to Zen practitioners, or people wanting to have more insight about combining cooking and spirituality, but also anyone who is interested in comparative religion, or spiritual traditions of the  world.",1240531200,8,2468,4.534831460674157

There were moments when watching the film that you can see the shock on the faces of his students as he hurls the ""F"" word because he didn't like the top on a bottle of vinegar.  He was impatient with his students and looked as though it pained him to have to repeat himself when giving instructions in a cooking class, or to have to answer their questions.  I was surprised and disappointed with his attitude and behavior because he's supposed to be a monk.  But, the only time he behaved in any way remotely like you would expect a Zen Buddhist Monk to behave was when he was being interviewed in his garb and sitting in what looked like his personal meditation room.  Basically you feel like you're watching 2 different people who happen to look exactly alike.  The video provided very little actual education and was just an exercise in watching this arrogant individual spew his thoughts. I suggest you skip the film and buy his recipe book.",1376006400,4,1064,4.568421052631579

Famed cookbook author Edward Espe Brown takes the old adage ""You are what you eat"" to a whole new level.  For this master chef/Zen priest believes you must actually become ""one"" with your food (and, as it turns out, with your utensils as well) if you are to ever attain true wholeness of body and spirit in this life.  Brown has been conducting courses on how to combine the art of meditation with the art of cooking for decades now, and the documentary ""How to Cook Your Life"" by German filmmaker Doris Dorrie (who went on to make the superb Zen-flavored drama ""Cherry Blossoms"" a year later) enrolls us in one of those courses - though we don`t get any actual credit for the class and, what's worse, we don`t get to sample any of the food.

Food for Brown has become a way of life - a spiritual and religious experience, as it were, a means of nurturing the soul as well as the body, of becoming one with nature.  And the more organic and less processed that food is the better.

Brown spends much of the time in the course dispensing words of wisdom on how to live life in greater harmony with the world around us, with food and cooking as the primary means of achieving that goal (let it be noted that the seminar takes place in a beautiful bucolic center in rural California).  And if the philosophizing gets to be a bit too much for you after awhile - as it did for me - and Brown seems more like a self-aggrandizing drama queen than an enlightened master at times (the crying over a teapot - and not even a broken one at that - is a bit much), you can at least savor all the tasty morsels that have been lovingly arrayed for our delectation.

Though, come to think of it, with his endless chatter and ceaseless pontificating, Brown puts us in mind of yet another popular expression:  ""How about a little less gab and a little more grub?""",1282953600,5,1851,4.326589595375722
3362890,2,B0014BQR74,"I started watching this video thinking it would have insights on harmonious, healthy eating.  The focus here, Edward Epse Brown, says when he was 10 years old, his aunt cooked him fresh baked bread, and it floored him- so much better than the packaged white breads and paper-like wheat bread.  He wondered how did society get to this state?  And then he becomes a pastry chef for a Buddhist monastery??  White flour is devoid of any nutritional value, throwing away most of the nutritional parts of wheat.  Anyways he is either genetically paunchy, or he has been eating too much white flour, sugar, and dairy.  He even mocks ""the macrobiotic"" buddhists who chew brown rice 50 times and eschew sugary foods, like raisins.  His students bake a lot of pastries, pizzas, white bread, etc.  So his way of eating and cooking just seems so against a zen way of living, especially if you're going to ask what went wrong with society (I checked the table of contents of his bread book: muffins, cookies, pastries, butters, pancakes).  We are too ingrained in the values of our society to escape it, just like all the health food stores where aisle after aisle, all you see are gluten-free cookies, packaged cereals, veggie burgers, etc.- still trying to satisfy those values.",1278201600,8,1267,4.8018433179723505

3362892,1,B0014BQR74,"How to Cook Your Life (Doris Dorrie, 2007)

Checked this out because I was hoping for a decent cooking documentary. Once again, I was instead handed evidence that there is, in fact, no such thing as a decent cooking documentary. While this isn't as outright awful as I Like Killing Flies, it's definitely a case of ""religion screws up something that might have otherwise been interesting"". Which is actually worse in some ways.

How to Cook Your Life is a glimpse into the world of Edward Espe Brown, author of The Tassajara Bread Book and The Tassajara Recipe Book. I've had both on my list of stuff to read for years, so when I saw a documentary of the author pop up, it immediately went onto the list. I got round to watching it last night, and of the documentary's ninety-four minutes, roughly six were devoted to cooking. Dorrie (Ich und Er) is far more interested in exploring Brown's religious, political, and social values, none of which have a bloody thing to do with cooking, and none of which are in any way interesting. There are a few digressions into the religious/social/political beliefs of close friends and attendees of Brown's cooking classes which are marginally more interesting. But not much.

What saves this from the same zero-star fate to which I Like Killing Flies was destined is that Brown himself seems like an affable sort. He means well, at least, even if (assuming Dorrie's account is in any way accurate) he seems singularly ineffective at getting anything across about the actual art of cooking, heading often into digressions about religion/politics/etc. etc. ad nauseam.  Not the worst thing I saw this weekend, but missed the title by a hair. *",1263600000,10,1681,4.806228373702422

3362896,5,B0014BQR74,"This movie, featuring Zen priest who is also a master cook is not a ""how to cook a dish"" type of movie. Actually it never shows how to prepare a single dish from the begining to the end, but how to work with our own minds. Zen teachings and commentaries are given by Edward Espe Brown (the priest), but also we have archival footage of the teachings of the Zen Master Suzuki,and also the interviews with the members of the Buddhist community.

Zen is a practice of mindfulness, and of course, there is a lot of it in this movie. But also are other aspects which are so very Zen: honesty, humor, poetry, humanity, compassion toward humans and animals, and the attitude toward the problems in our lives. Brown is a priest and a teacher, but he is has not a stature of a Zen master, yet anyone can see how much it can be learned from a practitioner who spend fourty years practicing Zen. And for those of you who like Dalai Lama and his sense of humor,there is also something charming about the brand of humor represented by Brown, and his master teacher, Suzuki.

Cooking was very important practice in Zen monasteries, but also any work done, and this movies shows how much meaning any work can have. Any work which serves the others can be elevated to a meaningful activity, and yes, be holly to some extend, if done with the right spirit.

And I just want to add a comment fro those who are not familiar with Mahayana Buddhism (to which Zen belongs). You can see Brown talking about old water kettles, and there is a lot of down to Earth poetry in it. But he also sheds a tear, so, why is he so emotional, someone may ask. As a long time practitioner, Ed Brown must have to take Boddhistava vows, which means such a practitioner has the attitude the others first. The vows are that the practitioner will by his/her own will be reincarnated again and again in order to help others, postponing his/her own ultimate state of Nirvana.

This is very courageous and compassionate decision, based on deep love to others. And of course, the meaning of service to others is very much extended, and felt very deeply. So, it is not a self pity, but an overwhelming emotion which came upon him. We could have a priviledge to witness this moment.

I recommend this movie not only to Zen practitioners, or people wanting to have more insight about combining cooking and spirituality, but also anyone who is interested in comparative religion, or spiritual traditions of the  world.",1240531200,8,2468,4.534831460674157
