7895604,5,6305809240,"These two eps are my favorites of the entire series, and I'm a huge fan.  These two stand out because they capture the best aspects of the series:  suspense, surprise, death, a timely topic (a mysterious plane crash and a  conspiracy to cover up the true cause), not to mention the requisite UFOs  and MIBs.  The first part sets up the mystery:  a passenger plane crashes  and Mulder wants to know why the government is interfering with the  investigation.  The second part wraps it all up satisfactorily... you  aren't left hanging with a bunch of unanswered questions that get dealt  with later in the season.  These two eps stand alone for the most part,  which makes them perfect for the 2-episode video format.  I highly  recommend it.",960681600,3,740,4.716535433070866
