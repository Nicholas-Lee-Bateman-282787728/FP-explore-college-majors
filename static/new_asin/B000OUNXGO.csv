2799807,4,B000OUNXGO,"This is very simplistic animation, but the story is the main thing, and these people obviously love Lovecraft and do follow the story well.  The voice actors are actually very very good.  People who are used to even Saturday morning cartoon animation will be somewhat disappointed with this kind of animation, but really, animation is the only way to do justice to this story.  In my opinion, this is well worth the money, particuarly if you are a real Lovecraft fan.  Guerilla Productions may have a really small budget, but Edward Martin and his cohorts have done a good thing in creating this little very minor masterpiece.  Well worth watching.",1187136000,12,648,4.8545454545454545
2799808,4,B000OUNXGO,"While a great story and fun to watch, this is not truly 'animated' in the way cartoons are done. It reminds me more of a storyboard with hand drawn line art being shown as the narrator's read a script. There are parts where it seems animated - such as the picture of a ship as it moves into the sunset - but at best it resembles some of the stories you viewed on Sesame Street as a youngster.

Now with that said, the art is terrific. It's interesting and as I said a fun story to read but just as nice to sit and watch. I showed this to some kids in the age range of 7-10 and they loved it. They didn't understand the story line much but they saw it as a 'quest' of sorts. Most of them loved the cats sequences and later enjoyed watching Randolph Carter make his way thru the Dream Lands.

If you're a fan of Lovecraftian & Cthulhu Mythos mania, then you'll want to get this DVD.

I rated it 4 out of 5 stars due to the fact it is not animation as we truly know it to be. Rather it's an illustrated & narrated story.",1184544000,20,1017,3.9754901960784315

2799818,4,B000OUNXGO,"Surprising well done, this was done using existing comics that they ""animated"" and added a voice over. For fans of the original story this is about as close as I have seen to a faithful retelling of a Lovecraft story.  Well aside from ""Call of Cthulhu"" done by the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society.

The release date is a little misleading though.  I bought the DVD from the publishers about 5 or so years ago.",1407110400,2,411,4.527027027027027

2799823,5,B000OUNXGO,"I wasn't sure what to expect going into this, having not familiarized myself with the art of Jason Thompson, but I was pleasantly surprised! The movie plays more like an audio slideshow than a true animation, but I think that adds more than it subtracts.

2799824,3,B000OUNXGO,"i would agree with all the reviews, both positive and negative about this dvd.  though there is some animation, it's bascially story-boarded like a comic book.  the artwork is very good and detailed.  mostly b&w with some color.  my issue with the movie is randolph carter's face.  it's drawn very non-descript, much like a smiley face.  all the other characters in the movie are well-drawn.  i know it's dream state and at the end, he wakes up and looks like lovecraft, but the face is too distracting and wish he would of filled it in with detail.  the soundtrack is very good and the voices of the characters are okay at best.  there is a couple of addtional shorts, one being 40 seconds long ""call of cathulu"" which is pretty silly.  the second, an 8 minute short that was okay.  i liked the grainy picture quality of it.  there are printed material in the dvd box and on bonus materials but i find the font too small and difficult to read.  i do applaud gorilla productions and hope they make more lovecraft inspired movies.",1361059200,,1029,4.5271739130434785
2799825,5,B000OUNXGO,"The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath has always been one of my favorite Lovecraft tales and features one of his best characters, Randolph Carter. The story features more excitement and adventure than many of Lovecraft's more horror-rooted work and could be adapted by many different filmmakers with many different results.

Edward Martin III, with very limited resources, is the first bold person to step up to the plate. This film is essentially one giant motion-comic, but if you're not opposed to that sort of thing, then this is a treat. The artwork is great, with much detail in scenes of importance (it actually comes from a graphic novel which I think many would do well to check out). The voice acting is admittedly amateur but not irritating, and Randolph himself is pretty likable. I thought Nyarlathotep was well done too.

There are a few minor changes in the story, but they feel so natural that many viewers may not even notice. The story is captured in full, the running time being near two hours. But I never felt bored.

Overall, this is one of the better adaptations out there, and a certain charm is lent to it by its indie qualities. This is not, however, a film for casual fans of Lovecraft or fans of animation. To some it may only appear to be a work print or animated story board. Having said that, the project as a whole is still very impressive. I've read that most of it was made by e-mail correspondence, which is no small feat.",1354579200,,1453,4.602316602316602
2799826,5,B000OUNXGO,This DVD is exactly what it perports to be. It stands as an excellent interpretation of KADATH text in animated form. This is truly an unique item for Lovecraft dream fans. Recommended.,1322438400,,185,4.8125
2799827,4,B000OUNXGO,"This is a graphic novel, minimally animated. The direction is good and the music is excellent! The illustrator has done a clever thing with the face of the protagonist which adds to the sense that he is in a dream. You never forget who we are interested in.",1319500800,2,257,4.375
2799828,2,B000OUNXGO,"Before deciding to buy this, I should have paid more attention to Nathaniel's review, which I mostly agree with.  If you had a son in High School who showed you art like this, you would compliment him and encourage him, but you wouldn't want to see it turned into a non-moving ""movie"".  I do like the way he draws the ghouls and ghasts, though.

I'm not quite sure who the intended audience is for this.  On the one hand, it's H. P. Lovecraft, so you would guess it would be for adults, but on the other hand, there is very little here that parents would have trouble with showing to their kids.  Much (but not all) of the dialogue and narration is in very short, simple sentences, as though it were being dumbed down and kiddified.  I don't know if kids would have the attention span for this, though.

The music provides a nice, spacey, creepy (but not too creepy) atmosphere which fits in well with a Lovecraft story more slanted towards fantasy than horror.  I haven't read the book in a while, but from what I remember, the film is very faithful to it.  (One very minor point: In the book, I think Pickman was the only ghoul who could still speak human, and served as a translator.)",1299283200,,1187,4.383561643835616
2799829,1,B000OUNXGO,"I'm sorry to say it, but this is my first 1-star review of anything. I'm especially sorry that it's about something that is Lovecraft-related. I'm a little torn between 1 and 2 stars. Some people might like this - and some people do, evidenced by the more positive reviews on amazon. I really wish I could give it more than one star, because you can sort of tell that the people who made this had their hearts in the right place, but if I'm being thoroughly honest and looking at this critically and analytically, it's really kind of a failure.
I didn't have spectacular hopes for this movie, even though it's the only film version of H.P. Lovecraft's epic Dreamquest of Unknown Kadath. I could see from the initial artwork on the DVD box that it's a little cartoony, and it doesn't bother me that the 'style' of the movie is still frames shot with narration (sort of like how stories are read in 'Reading Rainbow'). However, if you're going to be doing this style, you probably want to have real artwork. Actually, the ONLY things you need to worry about with this style (the only things that exist that the audience will be experiencing), are artwork/images and narration/voice acting/sound effects.

SEE:
The images we're shown are cartoon heavy-ink drawings on a sort of off-white paper. I was trying to convince myself, that some of the still-frame drawings are better than others, and it's nice to see their interpretations of certain things, but it's actually not at all. These drawings are sort of like something you'd see in a middle-school yearbook. Comic books even (the older comic books from 50 years go) - the Sunday comics (like, Prince Valiant) have a nicer art style than this. This alone is rather tragic, since H.P. Lovecraft's work - especially the Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath - truly deserves to be rendered in watercolor. And I remember picturing the beautiful Dreamlands in vivid, vibrant hues when I read the story, thinking what a wonderful movie it would make - certain scenes (like seeing that weird crystal city) would fit really well in the theater previews. Like I said though, I'm not blaming their budget here at all.
I really think that if you are making ANY kind of portrayal of H. P. Lovecraft's work, especially something that you know if going to be put on AN ACTUAL DVD - and you know that you're not going to be burdened with the process of animating it - wouldn't you try to have the best and most wondrous images that you could get ahold of? The Dreamlands need ANY kind of color - like even if they had done some crayon drawings, or some colored charcoal - an eclectic mix of children's interpretations constantly changing - that would be FAR more interesting to look at than this. Or maybe just ask around the college clubs if anyone wants to do some artwork to be put in a movie? And if you're dead-set on black and slightly-yellowed off-white, you need more shading, or some intricate hatch/cross-hatch.  These are doodles.
I am something of an artist myself, but I don't think that that makes me at all biased, since I'm also the sort of person who analyzes things logically and does his best to not hurt the feelings of others.
I feel like I'm picking on the person, but there's seriously one scene - near the beginning where Randolph Carter (who looks like a LEGO person with ropes for arms) walks the steps to talk with the priests, and instead DRAWING two priests, seated on two chairs, they just REVERSED THE FRAME when the other priest was supposed to be talking! They couldn't have scribbled out an extra priest? If they had picked up a napkin and took 39 seconds to draw one they would have drastically improved the scene.

HEAR:
As for the sound, it's also not good. The narrator/voice actor is alright, as in, he has a voice and doesn't seem to be coughing, dying of pneumonia, or sipping soda during the recording. He's not very dramatic about anything, and he doesn't seem to really change his voice very much when speaking for other people. So it's almost sort of like a book-reading... which kind of defeats the purpose of this being a movie...
On a personal note, his voice sort of gives me the feeling - has the character of - like the sort of know-it-all people you might talk to at your local comic or roleplaying game store - like, highly knowledgeable about things which are detailed but relatively meaningless, and relentless in giving opinions about things you probably don't care about. There is nothing epic or mysterious about his tone. The descriptions are relatively monotone, and the voices he does are inappropriately casual. Like, 'oh, yeah, mysterious god-faces on a desolate mountain-top? You don't say?' There's a female voice actress as well, who is a little bit more storybookish about it. I liked her a little more maybe, just because she has more personality (the personality of a kindergarten teacher). But, no Patrick Stewart or Max von Sydow won't be joining us for this one, and neither will anyone who was in forensics or took theater. Somewhat ironically, I think that even if they had been more lively or even hammy and cartoonish it might have matched with their pictures more and made it more interesting.
The sound effects themselves are extremely basic and minimalist (and I'm not revering to minimalist music), like, door opens, footsteps: 'clunk clunk'. Not just nothing extravagant: nothing imaginative; nothing weird. Now that I think about it, they could have had some weird music too to go along with it too. They don't.

One thing I do appreciate is that the story and the narrative is taken pretty much word for word from the book. Nothing was changed at all and they kept the text of Lovecraft. However, saying that is pretty much like saying that I liked the book, which I did. And having this guy read some of it to you in his bland devil-may-care tone really is not worth it. Buy a book on tape, or get your grandpa or neighbor to read it for you and you'll be better off, or just read it aloud to yourself if you must. Or, uh, actually, just read the book yourself.
Even if you have the clunkiest most unimaginative brain in the world, anything you picture or hear in your head is better than this movie. Don't let this sour it for you, and just get the book yourself.
And if you're thinking of getting this movie to entertain your kids, I'd suggest getting the book to entertain your kids.

So basically, I could have made a better movie and so could you, given a $500 hardware budget (that includes a computer and a scanner), 1 or 2 sharp-minded people of your choosing, or 5 random people picked out of a crowd. This movie is of lesser quality than most college level projects, and many middle-school projects. I'm actually thinking of making one myself just to prove my point.

Not only that, but this movie really started to RUIN THE BOOK for me. Every time I think of that watercolored dream-tale, I'll have - somewhere in a closet labeled 'burn these later' in my brain - the memory of this poor attempt at cinema. As a college final, it would have gotten a B. As a true interpretation of Lovecraft's epic adventure, it fails completely. It fails on more than one level.
I often get together with my friends and we inevitably find stupid movies to make fun of. After seeing how this was, I brought it over for them, and we couldn't even get through it. And we get through everything. We watched Country Bears all the way through. Yeah, Christopher Walken is great - for the five minutes he's in it! The other 83 is really pretty horrendous. We contemplated suicide.",1297468800,3,7581,4.624350408314774
8186761,1,B000OUNXGO,"Abysmal.  Like listening to a lengthy, badly-acted and monotonous radio drama while watching an amateur pen & ink slideshow.  Talk about low budget.

You could have read Lovecraft's story (and ENJOYED it) in less time than this farce steals from your life.

I mean, I understand what inspired this mess: The 1924 Peter Rhodes film based on Lovecraft's story ""The Other Gods""; but that was a 5-minute, black &white animated short that was way ahead of its time and became a  classic for Lovecraft fans over the decades.

This, on the other hand, is NOT a classic...it's an embarrassment.",1524614400,,586,4.8686868686868685
8186762,1,B000OUNXGO,"the artist (Jason Thompson) for this ""movie"" (more of a roughly animated storyboard really) has done an INCREDIBLE poster of HP Lovecrafts Dreamlands (not to mention his classic D&D poster art which i also LOVE)....that poster almost makes me cry it's so perfect and beautiful beyond words...i (foolishly) assumed he had put the same effort into this Kadath flick. wrong. fail. this thing could have been a MASTERPIECE with his artistry! all he had to do was draw about 100 decent backgrounds and put a few part-moving character stills over it to get a ""AAA+++"" grade from me. But all we get here is rough UN-colored line drawings. what a waste of effort. (Unless this was a storyboard from which a finished product was to be made, then it would have been fine). my grade for this effort is ""D-"" (i'm being generous....""FFF---"" is more accurate considering what COULD have been with just a few hours of effort) So, don't waste your money on the DVD, maybe rent the 2.99 version, watch it and be sad as i am for all it could and SHOULD have been. pft. And so please don't bother to make anymore movies if you're not going to draw them properly Jason...i LOVE your work but this was a waste. (oh and nice try promotion team with trying to fool me with the trailer which showed NOTHING of the actual film, because if it had i sincerely doubt ANYONE would buy this based on a more telling trailer!) Oh and many of the voice actors are apsolutley AWFUL...sorry guys...but really....try listening to how other people do it and then learn your art!...BEFORE doing any more terrible performances.

8186766,1,B000OUNXGO,Terrible rip-off!  Other recent indie Lovecraft productions at least used live actors and had honest production values.  Even the voice acting was miserable--like people reading from a phone book. The good reviews for this must come from the film's makers and their families/friends.,1465084800,3,283,5.558139534883721
8186767,2,B000OUNXGO,"I tried this out because I love Lovecraft, and any reasonably faithful adaptation of his works to film should be commended. I don't need fancy special effects, and didn't expect them for this film. This is an illustrated version, not even an animated one. The movie is a series of camera shots panning, zooming, and cutting across static drawings as voice actors and narrators recite text and dialogue from the story. I'm actually fine with that, and would have loved to have seen it done well.

Unfortunately, the voice acting was worse than amateur. ""Amateur"" would have implied that the people did it for love. But the voice work lacks any affect or dynamic range, sounding as emotionally invested as a corporate training video from the '80s. It seems like the producers found someone with no exposure to Lovecraft's works and gave them their lines to record without any rehearsal, even so much as a single read-through beforehand. I can give the project a pass on the production values, because that depends highly on money, but I can't give it a pass on the acting: that depends mostly on care and craftsmanship, and they are just not present here.",1457654400,2,1153,4.793969849246231
