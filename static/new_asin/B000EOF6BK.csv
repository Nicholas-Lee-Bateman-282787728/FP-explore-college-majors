8205479,5,B000EOF6BK,"This dvd has brought back so many great memories of when I was a kid and when my family had these videos on vhs.  Those videos are long since gone and I was very surprised to find it on amazon since Frank De Lima doesn't offer to let us purchase it on his website.  This item was in very great condition and was even autographed by uncle Frank himself.

Thank you so much for having it. I watched it as soon as it arrived.

This dvd includes ""The best of de lima"" filmed in 1987 at the old noodle house where he plays and sings about various ethic groups that Hawai'i locals are all too familiar with including Pocho Man and Abdullah Fata'ai. This dvd also includes ""the best of de lima too! !"" Which features him as Glenn Miashiro and also the Haoles' anonymous group.
The third part of the dvd is him at the Polynesian cultural center where he talks about his traveling to different countries and different parts of the US along with making fun of the ethnicities we all know and live in Hawaii.

I hope the seller has more to sell as I may but these as presents in the future.  100% would buy again.",1451433600,2,1102,4.223809523809524
