8484124,5,B005R5DT42,Awesome Dvd. but I suggest to purchase the work book.,1469059200,,53,4.4
8484125,5,B005R5DT42,"I just receive the Afro-Cuban Percussion Workbook DVD as a companion to the book. The DVD is the best, great accompaniment to the book. There are times I wish the rhythms had been played slower but it will help to refer to the notations from the book. The Afro-Cuban Percussion Workbook covers a lot of ground and I feel the DVD is essential in clarifying the material from the book. There's also the bonus interview of Jose Eladio Amat and percussion extras. I should also add there's a segment demonstrating how to play rumba quinto with clave and the other rumba conga parts. I had been hesitating about buying this DVD but I'm glad I decided to buy it. I would recommend this to anyone interested in increasing their knowledge of Afro-Cuban percussion.",1457395200,,756,4.69172932330827

8484128,5,B005R5DT42,"If you want to learn Afro-Cuban percussion this the book for you.  The book starts out basic and works its way to advanced.  With this book and a lot of "" wood-shed"" one can become a conguerdo or conguerda extraordinaire.",1401408000,3,221,4.5
