880742,5,6304465270,"This is truly a classic for any dude that was anywhere near the hood in the south. This was motivation, politically correct, how real men should be today - no punk.",1327795200,,164,4.32258064516129
880743,5,6304465270,i love this movie i watch it everyday and I think the guy that plays his brother in this movie is a great actor.,1297382400,,112,3.7083333333333335

880745,4,6304465270,"I'm Bout It is a rare black film, that's so bad it's good. The acting is horrible, camera angles and cinematography are all done with a home camera and the script doesn't flow. I mean you can't help but laugh when a man is tied up and sweaty, replies to his captors by saying f**k you, like he's gonna do something.",1221350400,,315,4.180327868852459
880746,5,6304465270,"this is by far one of the most gangster rap films, i recomend this along side other no limit films, HOT BOYS, no tomorrow, da last don all solid NO LIMIT films, NO LIMIT SOULJAS RUN THIS RAP GAME",1159401600,,195,4.0256410256410255
880747,5,6304465270,"This movie was the bomb by far, I seen the movie when it first hit the seen in ""97"". This movie is a classic no matter how low-budget you thought it was. You get a chance to see New Orleans as it was then before Hurricane Katrina hit. This city will probably never be the same so that's why I say that this movie is a hip-hop classic so go cop this one!",1129334400,,353,3.8493150684931505
880748,5,6304465270,"This faithful picturization of Master P's grim and depressing drama of Southern decadence will shock many regular picturegoers just as it will be widely praised and discussed by sophisticated patrons. Because of the realism of its squalid way of life, the earthy quality of chief characters and its frankness in dwelling on sex, it is strictly adult fare. The fame of the Broadway stage hit, which won the Pulitzer Prize and toured the key cities, and curiosity about P's portrayal will attract feminine fans and insure strong grosses in the metropolitan centers. It's too talky and slow-moving for neighborhood or action houses. This is a sordid tale of unhappy humans and director Master P has spared the audience nothing by revealing the savage brutality of the dirty south.",1114992000,3,777,5.078125
880749,5,6304465270,"Master P is the bomb, Mr Serv On is the man as Pac Man.  This movie changed my life.  I had to go out and buy every no limit record out there once i saw it and belive me i put alot of money in P's wallet.  Get this movie",1105488000,,220,3.36
880879,1,6304465270,"If you like poor acting, glorification of ""ghettoes and gangsters and guns"" (oh, my), outrageously dated dialougue, crude sexuality, and needless violence (as well as hard core gagster-rap), then throw your money away on this mess. ... As Master P (Percy Miller) himself would say, UNHHHHHHHH!",1022025600,,293,5.391304347826087
880880,4,6304465270,"This movie is quite tight. this sh** keeps it real for most part but just exagarates about how ""bad"" Master P was/is. But is basicly acurate. Every seen in this movie is tight its more than good enough to rent this is a ""classic"" that needs to be owned on your ""Hall of Fame"" movie collection shelf. The only bad part is it looks like they filmed it with a home video camara with the poor film quality and some bad camara angles. (NEEDS TO BE REMASTERED ON DVD!)",1019606400,,462,4.202247191011236
880881,5,6304465270,"This movie is surprisingly good. Master P  does a good job of portraying himself in this movie as a young thug. Owes more than a little to Menace 2 society and Boyz n' the hood(note,P gets shot in the shoulder ,just like in Menace 2 society).Silkk the Shocker plays P's younger brother Silkk. C-Murder(who, along with Silkk the Shocker is P's brother in real life)has about 10 minutes in the movie as P's younger brother Q.A realistic(if not sometimes exaggerated )count of life in the Calliope projects.
Stay tuned for music videos after the movie.",992649600,,549,4.778947368421052
880882,4,6304465270,IT is Master P's best getto movie Note: This is NOT a movie for the whole family It was great alough there was some boring parts in it that will make you FF threw it but it was great.,987811200,2,183,3.717948717948718
880883,5,6304465270,"big ups to massa p for this golden ghetto fabulous masterpiece, chronicling his rise to fame from the streets (this must not be a true story because they left out the scene where p sells his soul to the devil  so that people will buy and actually listen to his horrible, horrible music  (and i stress horrible). i liked alot about this movie. i didn't so much  like the bad acting, the bad camera shots/angles, the plot (i use the term  loosely), the passing script that was probably written on napkins as  filming went along, or the glorification of violence and abuse to women.  no, i liked the underlying theme of homoeroticism between p and his boyz.  you could tell that in all of their b-boy posturing there was a real sense  of longing and desire to express their physical attraction for one another  in the hot, sweaty, dirty south. if they would have centered the movie  around that i would have definitely been more 'bout it.",963446400,5,935,4.544910179640719
880884,4,6304465270,"The soundtrack was tight, and the movie was alright. The acting wasn't that good, but this is a gangsta movie what did you want five star movie. Yeah right you betta ask somebody. Peace No Limit 2000.",956707200,,200,4.4324324324324325
880885,1,6304465270,I think this movie was so poor acted. to me master p needs to sit down and rest because he can't act or direct a movie,949190400,3,118,3.576923076923077

7871685,1,6304465270,I bought this movie because I used to have the original on VHS. I swear it looked better on VHS. The quality of this movie is so bad.
