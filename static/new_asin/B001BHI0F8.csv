8283265,1,B001BHI0F8,"I bought this CD ""learn to play Harmonia a few weeks ago and was most disappointed as it contains no information for a beginner. In fact the author seems more interested in displaying his skills on this instrument  than to teach the fundamentals of playing this instrument. I like to find a way to return this item and get a refund. towards the purchase of something more useful for beginners. Therefore the title of this video is grossly misleading",1397865600,,449,4.6835443037974684

8283267,1,B001BHI0F8,"Although Dr. Ravindra Katoti is obviously a sincere student of the harmonium and an excellent performer, this DVD will give you very little help in learning to play the instrument. The audio quality is very poor, with the volume constantly going up and down, and there's a loud background hum throughout. The video quality is uneven as well. As far as the DVD's content, the first 20 minutes are a tedious review of the instrument's history and construction. You don't actually start playing the harmonium at all until the 7th of the 9 chapters. Then the only instruction is a long demonstration of simple scale patterns. This ""lesson"" is about 10 minutes long. The DVD then concludes with a performance of by Dr. Katoti and a tabla player, which is interesting musically but not particularly instructive.

There's no explanation of how to use the harmonium's air stop knobs or drone knobs. If you can play a C-major scale on the piano, you already know everything this DVD teaches you about playing the harmonium, except for the following: pump the bellows as little as possible; one pump is enough for several notes. And you can hold a note and give the bellows a gentle pump for a crescendo effect.",1243900800,23,1201,4.774038461538462
