8577805,4,B00C6WHRM4,"Enjoyed DESPITE the sound not being synchronous with the video. Other movies and TV are just fine as far as synchronicity. I watched this twice. Richard Bellman is one of my math heroes (although the film is probably more about his family). Nevertheless, very interesting. Incidentally, both times the synchronicity was a problem although 4 days apart and at different times of the day.",1457913600,,386,5.046875

8577812,5,B00C6WHRM4,"I'm sort of at a loss of words as I write this review. The film is absolutely beautiful. I also found it very intriguing and I loved being able to get an authentic look into this famous mathematician's personal life. It is a story of father and sons, but all in all it is about family.

In a way I owe much of who I am to the legacy of this story. The Reason being is that the son of Richard Bellman who starred in the film is my therapist and it is absolutely true what they say about the ""Bellman Brain""....his son Eric Bellman is a remarkable human being and I'm personally very grateful that he used his natural talent and insight to ""help people"" as he mentioned in the film. I tell everyone Eric is a genius and after watching this film, I see that apparently it is a common theme in the family!

In a lot of ways, I believe his dedication to his profession and his patients is along the same lines of his father's drive and determination to change the world for the better using mathematics. The argument they shared concerning ""love""....WOW. Such different men but somehow they were both a part of each other stories, as well as each other's greatness.

I do believe this is a wonderfully gifted family and I imagine Gabriel will make the same type of impact after viewing this film.

Bravo!",1406937600,4,1299,4.355371900826446
8577813,5,B00C6WHRM4,The Bellman Equation demonstrates Gabriel Bellman's genius in his intuitive narrative film of his family's history.  Mr. Bellman's work describes his family's history with sensitivity and intuitive understanding of father's and son's through the part of history that included what families were going through adjusting to change during the depression.  Gabriel's family appeared to have survived and thrived through a multitude of meaningful challenges and experiences.  This film is worth seeing and may be useful as a tool for educational purposes used as part of  curriculums for various media and scholarly institutions.  Best Wishes for your future endeavors Gabriel.,1390867200,5,672,5.747474747474747
