On the back of the DVD case for this film it states:

""This film rescues Haydn from any neglect he may have previously suffered.""

This statement is one hundred percent accurate.  If you knew nothing about Haydn before viewing this documentary, you'll certainly know him intimately after viewing this extraordinary film!

The long career of Franz Joseph Hayden (1732 to 1809), an Austrian composer, spanned the decades when the Classical style was being formed.  He imprinted upon it the stamp of his personality, and made a contribution to his art--especially the symphony and string quartet--that in scope and significance was unmatched.

We are informed of Haydn's early years in Vienna.  Before long, he attracted the notice of the music-loving aristocracy in Vienna.  One wealthy family employed him and he remained in their service for almost an amazing thirty years (the greater part of his creative career).

Haydn's life can be said to be the classic example of the patronage system operating at its best.

This film along the way looks at Haydn's humour, his operas, his international success, and his London journeys.

Throughout this documentary, are comments by experts (historians, conductors, pianists, etc.)  As well, there are performance of Haydn's works by the world's most celebrated musicians.

Simply stated, this film is a visual and aural feast!!  I found the location footage especially beautiful.

Extras for the DVD released in 2012 include complete movements of some of Haydn's large body of work and an interview with the film's director (Phil Grabsky).

Finally, the movements for the extra mentioned above are from:

(1) Symphonies no. 30, 86, and 100
(2) String quartets no. 33/2 ""The Joke"" and no. 76/1
(3) Sonatas in E no. 34 and in E flat
(4) Piano trio in B flat
(5) Aria di Merlina

In conclusion, this documentary is a visual and aural extravaganza!  It truly does save Haydn from obscurity!!

8508835,3,B0072FEW64,"Assessment based on two telephone conversations with Phil Grabsky of approximately 40 minutes each (August 13 and 21, 2012). This I felt advisable having listened to his interview on disc several times (this after having first studied the documentary itself in some detail).

Phil Grabsky's sincerity was without question and so I felt I should present him with some of my misgivings and to ask him a few pointed questions that could have explained his approach in presenting Haydn to us.

I have little to complain about in the flow of the narrative apart from the omissions in a few vital areas, notably the great fire at Eszterhza in 1779, with its disastrous consequences in the destruction of property, including valuable musical instruments and music scores. In addition the early, formative years might have been given more serious treatment. (See bellow in respect of time allocation compared to the films on Mozart & Beethoven.)

Further omissions:

Younger brother Michael (Haydn). The Mozart connection, eg. Symphony No. 37 Mozart/Haydn. M.

The friendship with Mozart (unique in the history of music) - the ""Haydn"" quartets. Reciprocal influences. Haydn acknowledged Mozart's Operatic skills just as Mozart learned from Haydn's contrapuntal dexterity.

Before departing for London on 15 December 1790, Haydn spent the day with Mozart in Vienna. Mozart demonstrated a premonition of his own impending premature death: ""I fear, father, that this will be our last farewell"".

Generally more attention to the period from 1790 (including the death of Mozart and any possible impact upon Haydn) up to 1801. Haydn's support of Constanze Mozart and her son following the death of Mozart.

Relationship with Beethoven should have been expanded. A coolness, sometimes in excess from Beethoven who played down Haydn's influence compositionally.

Journey to England - the tempestuous Channel crossing - ""The Storm""

In England visit to William Herschel (musician and astronomer) near Bath The Creation (influences: The Messiah).

Friendship with Marianna von Genzinger (died 1793) Sym. 99/II.

Friendship with Mrs Rebecca Shroeter in London (Sym 102/II)

Orchestration in The Creation and The Seasons: use of trombones etc.

The SIX LATE MASSES an annual requirement from the Prince for the Name Day of the Princess.

The Second TE DEUM in C major.

Death of Haydn's wife in 1800.

The late song settings. Folksongs arrangements for Thomson in Edinburgh 1795 - 1804/5

The two final Masses. (Demonstrating that Haydn was not ""entirely"" without inspiration after the two oratorios.)

The final years and the agony of inventive impulse stifled by physical and mental fatigue.

(Haydn's masterly, inventive and prolific output in later years was just as phenomenal in its way as the flowering of early genius in the case of Schubert, Mendelssohn and Mozart himself.)

*****

In view of the above, I wanted to know why Grabsky had devoted only 102 minutes(*) to the documentary on F J Haydn and to have him explain his modus operandi. It would appear that many of his sources derived from the previous presentations on Mozart and Beethoven. I asked why he had not approached the Haydn Society of G.B. without receiving a precise answer.

However, I must make it clear that the issue of funding was central to these discussions.

There appeared to be a number of additional restraints, some based on a hunch, I felt, that audiences might become restless with a longer presentation. (There was also the suggestion that with a shorter piece a greater number of cinema performances could be ""squeezed in"", a proposition I found somewhat fatuous and in a sense contradictory.)

And so, I further explored the possible reasons why longer films might be acceptable for Mozart and Beethoven, but not for Haydn. I am still not sure that I have fully grasped Phil's explanation! Yes, there were limitations based on funding, as we have said, but this was only part of the story. There seemed to be some apprehension that the available material would not ""hold up"" or fill the space. This I could not go along with: if not enough biographical material (as we have indicated, much more might have been gleaned at little or no extra cost) then there is plenty of music from Haydn ""the unknown"" (Tovey) that could have been presented in an inspiring way so as to hold the audiences' attention.

In this area I had the impression that more preparatory work should have been done although, again, of course, I recognise the constraints in terms of both time and funding.

Next, having secured the services of two excellent interpreters of Haydn, namely the Endellion String Quartet and the The Orchestra of the 18th Century with Frans Brggen, I was interested to know how much flexibility Grabsky had in the selection of works. It would appear that he was guided by the performers themselves. I then queried the predominance of slow movments in the documentary (another area raised by Tony Hodgson** in his review). Why, for example, in the case of Symphony No. 82 (""The Bear""--nickname not mentioned) give an extract from movement II rather than movement IV in which the ""drone"" or ""bagpipes"" effect could be used to make a point? True we had part of the envigorating finale to argueably the finest of the Paris set, namely No. 86, (also featured separately on disc) but the comments from Norrington in this ""frame"" focussed on No. 85 ""La Reine"". Where the London Symphonies are concerned I can only reiterate Tony Hodgson's comments in his review. (Suggestion: Symphony No. 96, first movement, illustrating Haydn's monothematicism.)

An important and dramatic component to the London Symphonies is the introduction of the minor mode in some of the slow movements commencing with Symphony No. 96 (if we assume this work predates No's 93 and 94). Therefore, how effective it would have been if the slow movement from No. 101 (exampled in the film) could have been allowed to run into the minor mode section of the movement.

I gave several examples where a more effective use of the orchestra might have been made.
Again, more preparation might have gone towards securing effective selections. (The ""farewell"" episode should have been mentioned in the narrative, as indeed it was, but perhaps a short, complete movement from a symphony of the period--the finale from No. 41, for example, might have grabbed (no pun intended) the audiences' attention more effectively, as well as illustrating our point (Tony Hodgson's and mine) respecting the use of trumpets and drums in the C major symphonies.

The late Trumpet Concerto, and one of the earlier Cello Concertos in C major, were both given fitting treatment, but as for the late song settings? Not a squeak! Why?

It was clear that Grabsky would have liked to feature visual ""shots"" of massed voices in the choral works but that funding prohibited this. He clearly had a high regard for the late masses but restricted himself to a short extract from the Mass in Time of War (Missa in tempore belli or Paukenmesse). Here, surely, it would have been more effective to start with the Agnus Dei and its dramatic trumpet call leading into the Dona, rather than to give us the fugal Amen?

I was particularly interested to learn why a good deal of time was given to the solo keyboard works and to opera. (Some of the comments by the soprano on Haydn's writing for her range I found misleading; she clearly had not sung in the late Masses!) For many of my students who saw the film the keyboard representation came close to being a ""turn off"". Watching the B minor sonata performed on a modern piano is not the best way to illustrate Haydn's mastery of the evolving pianofortes of Broadwood et al such as we have in the late keyboard trios. So why not, for instance, ask the Florestan Trio to give us a taste of Hob. XV:27 (finale?) in addition to the sample from Hob. XV:20?

But surely one of the most noteworthy omissions was a more thorough expansion of the short extract from the F minor Variations for piano solo Hob. XVII: 6 that could have been used not only to demonstrate the double variation Haydn specialism, but also to draw attention to the composer's mastery of variation form that features so strongly in many of his other compositions, notably the symphony and the string quartet.

The importance of Haydn's contribution to the evolution of the string quartet was too fragmentary in my opinion (again I concur with Tony Hodgson). The essence of Haydn is indeed to be found in the slower movements of many of the string quartets. This was demonstrated in the short extract from the Quartet Op. 54/2. But some comment was due, surely? "". . . there is no more original Haydn quartet, nor any that contains more prophetic innovations, than the second ""Tost"" Quartet . . ."" (The Great Haydn Quartets: Hans Keller.) So let us enlarge on this fact and give the viewer/listener another taste of the profound Haydn with, perhaps, the slow movement (Largo cantabile e mesto) from Op76/5, or the slow movement from the ""Rider"" itself.

We had some comparisons with Beethoven taken from Haydn's late C major piano (fortepiano) sonata; it would have been instructive to show just how much Beethoven had from Haydn in the genre of the quartet, a form that Haydn brought to perfection virtually single-handed. There was a brief extract from the finale of the G maj/min Quartet Op 74/3 (""Rider""), but we are denied the full details beyond a short notice in print. More instructive, in our opinion, would have been to give a stronger representation from Op 76 or Op 77. (Perhaps Op. 76/6 ""scherzo"" in addition to Op. 71/1 first movement already included.)

I would also have made the point somewhere in the narrative that the ""nicknamed"" works are not necessarily the most interesting or the most accomplished.

I hope, perhaps, to have demonstrated that there is sufficient material here to fill 130 minutes or so without stretching the budget strings or introducing a ""note"" of tedium--on the contrary.

At the end of our discussions I was convinced that Phil Grabsky had discovered the true Haydn for himself, but I still have my doubts as to whether his production will point many waverers in the right direction.

Addendum:

(*)Factual: Haydn 102 minutes compared to 124 minutes for Mozart and 139 minutes for Beethoven. Consider, in The New Grove the article on F J Haydn is given on 79 pages, Mozart on 72 pages and Beethoven 59 pages (text in double columns). Moreover, Haydn lived to the ripe old age of 77 years, whereas Mozart died aged 35 and Beethoven died aged 57 years.

** Tony Hodgson's comments in his review for the Haydn Society of G.B.

Footnote.

I ask myself why it is that a composer of so-called classical music, namely Franz Joseph Haydn, could be hailed as the greatest living composer at the close of the 18th Century and yet require vigorous resuscitation in our times in order to present the man as the equal of Mozart and Beethoven. Is it just a question of changing fashions or has Haydn simply been misrepresented latterly, or what . . .?

Before we go any further perhaps we should look at the prerequisites for celebrity status (for it may be reasonable to regard Beethoven and Mozart as celebrities in their day in a way that Haydn was not?).

Of course the basis for our analysis will make several assumptions not least the universal criteria applicable, or not, in two periods separated by two centuries. (Today's media dissemination via radio and television into the earlobes and eyes sockets of billions knew no parallel in Haydn's time.)

And so, who is likely to figure more prominently in the people's esteem or perception, the craftsman or the virtuoso? I submit that our preoccupation with celebrities has forced the craftsman into the background. In music, for example, both Mozart and Beethoven, as instrumental virtuosi (and Mozart in particular having been a child prodigy on keyboard if not on violin) will appeal more to the masses than a Bach or a Haydn (both acknowledged as among music's greatest craftsmen). And the personal circumstance of early death (in the case of Mozart) and the progressive deafness and premature death, in the case of Beethoven, cannot be ignored as appealing to the public's imagination. (A cosseted child prodigy, Mozart, compared to the physical hardships of the young, diligent Haydn?)

Johannes Brahms, for example, represents a happy synthesis of the two: a virtuoso pianist emerging from many hardships in early life into a fine craftsman (with overtones in his personal life - the Schumann connections). But I suspect it is the craftsmanship in the case of Brahms that makes him the staple diet of the contemporary music scene at all levels from instrumentalists and musicologists to the ""passive"" listener. So, why not Haydn? Could it be that there are as many ill-informed musicians on Haydn today as was Robert Schumann when he declared that Haydn had little to offer the musician of his day? Could it be the fault of the impresario? Could it be the fault of the musicologists? (Ref: H. C. Robbins Landon Mozart's 1791 Last Year, preface, final page. Is this a fair or reasonable representation of Haydn in relation to Mozart as a man and as a musician?)

And so on . . .
