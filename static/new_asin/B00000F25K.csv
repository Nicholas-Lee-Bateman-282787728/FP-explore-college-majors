1201258,5,B00000F25K,"This movie is the most moving and heartwarming I've seen about man's friendship with dogs.  In fact, I watched it with my dog, and she was transfixed by the dog sequences.  It is completely ridiculous that the studio hasn't put it out on DVD yet, as, from what I hear, it's the 2nd highest grossing movie in Japanese history, and I can see why.  The dialogue is a bit wooden, but, hey! it's a Japanese movie, and we've all seen the old Godzillas and they're not any better.  One good thing is that it's mostly narrated in english, so no subtitles.  The soundtrack is a total plus, coming from Vangelis, the master of the keyboards.  If you don't have a smile on your face at the end of this, you're a robot.  The good thing about this particular video is that IF you don't like it, you're basically assured of your money back in re-sale value.  Where can you go wrong?  You like the movie?  It's a masterpiece in YOUR library!  You DON'T like the movie?  Sell it and make your money back and maybe more.  This purchase is a no-brainer.",1120435200,22,1035,4.356020942408377

1201260,5,B00000F25K,"Hi! I'm from Milan, Italy, and I looked for this movie SO MUCH since I watched it in Italian at least ten years ago. Never found it anymore. I would *LOVE* to get it in DVD, especially because it's impossible for us to get it here. Too bad. Like I said, just go get it. IT'S MUCH MORE THAN WORTH! You can really discover how real geniuses can touch the right ""ropes"" of our souls and make us cry like children. Not just for animal lovers (I'd recommend it to really ANYONE!). Great, definitively.",1073001600,10,496,4.287234042553192
1201261,5,B00000F25K,Superb films.  I liked it so I bought it when it was still very expensive.  Should be brought out in DVD to capture the full beauty.,1071360000,8,132,4.038461538461538

It has touched the hearts in Japan and one feels a great emotion.
It is a kind of lecture for life, love and help.
The music (by Vangelis) is superb !!
It would be nice to have this release in dvd.",1068422400,10,230,4.021739130434782
1201263,5,B00000F25K,"a gorgeous and devastating film.  witnessing not only the huskies' emotion-wrenching plight but also the heartbreak and devotion of the scientist who brought the dogs is almost too much to bear; and not just for animal-lovers but for anyone with a pulse.  the movie is so absorbant, one does not even realize they are reading subtitles!  i cried tears of joy and sorrow.
truly, a masterpiece on all aesthetic, emotional, and technical levels!",1066780800,6,442,5.027397260273973

something special about it. I've tried rentals ,etc...*Plese* don't let this movie die ,The Dogs steels the show completly ,So much that you completly forget about the actors ,,All we seem to  care about are the Huskies.

1201265,5,B00000F25K,"I was fortunate enough to view this movie when I was about 8 years old.  My father suggested it to me.  It is a Japanese movie with english subtitles.  I hate subtitles but this movie can make you look past that.  The Japanese name for the movie is NAN KYOKU MONOGATARI.  I hadn't seen the movie in years and one day I was in a movie rental store in Japan and I heard the soundtrack (main theme song is beautiful) to the movie being played throughout the store.  The song immediatley brought me back 12 years to the time I had watched this movie.  I asked my Japanese girlfriend about the song and I told her I knew the movie.  That totally shocked her.  So we rented it.  It was all in Japanese and I have to say I loved it more this time then the first time I watched it.  I couldn't understand Japanese at the time so I couldn't understand the dialoague, but the story is so great that it made me forget about the fact that I couldn't understand.
  Ken Takakura (Mr. Baseball), plays the leader of a dogsliegh team.  If you like Dogs this is the movie for you.  Forget Bengi, Balto, Lassie, Rin Tin Tin, Old Yeller.  This is based on a True Story and Legend in Japan.  I hate most Japanese movies this one is the exception.  ...",1017705600,8,1231,4.188034188034188
1201335,5,B00000F25K,"I first saw this movie on HBO in 1985. I will never be the same. The movie is a masterpiece, and you'll never forget the story. Absolutely the one movie that made the biggest impression on me.
Wow is all I can say.",1188691200,4,214,4.0
1201336,5,B00000F25K,"This is a spectacular film and it's faults, generally related to the expected low quality one sees in most Japanese films, is easily forgotten because the story is true, and fairly recent.

The Amazon review however, is a bit of spoiler and also erroneous in its statement that the dogs were ""inadvertently"" left behind.

Still, if this film doesn't connect with you emotionally, call the paramedics!  Because your heart has left your body.",1177113600,3,440,5.0

1201338,5,B00000F25K,"It's kinda funny that I watched this movie in Japan when I was 9 and I still thought about it time to time.  I even remember some of the scenes from the movie.  Honestly, I don't remember the whole story because it was over 20 years ago and I was so young when I watched it.  But I know how much I loved the movie and how much I cried.  It made a hunge impression in my young mind.  Recently Disney remade the movie (Eight below) and instantly I recognized it.  Well, I think the remade is okay but I still think the original movie is better.  I really hope that they release this movie in DVD sometime soon.",1152403200,4,608,4.0588235294117645
1201339,5,B00000F25K,"Well, I finally saw it and what can I say? Five stars for those gorgeous animals and the telling of these poor canines tragic tale, in hopes that we can learn from it, to never allow such a thing to happen again.  Also kudos for the caption in the end mentioning quite boldly that all the dogs were handled with the utmost of care, and that anything that showed harm to the animals was simulated.  Needless to say, the film was as gorgeous as they say... and much more heartbreaking than I had originally anticipated, even for an avid animal lover as myself who has seen way too much. My heart goes out to those poor, precious K-9 heroes left to die, all because equipment is considered more important than loving, loyal, four-legged souls. A concept I will never understand, especially since those animals are the very ones that saved the lives of the explorers. Where's the gratitude?!!! And One might say, ""Well, that was 1957, things have changed since then""... but what of the later heroic Vietnam War dogs left to die... the more recent K-9 Katrina victims... and the never-ending stories of the no longer interested families leaving their pups to fend for themselves, just to name a very minor few?!!! The love the explorers showed for their dogs was very touching, but even there, I felt that they should have stayed with the dogs until they were sure another team would show, especially since the weather was so bad and things were being handled so much more differently than usual... but having failed doing that, they should have, at the very least, attempted to return with immediate, continued and absolute persistence!  Once home, they simply stopped trying.  If it were their children that were stranded, you know they would have found a way; they would have done whatever it took.  You never leave a man -- or dog -- behind (especially when you brought them there and they saved your life!). With that, I do suggest that everyone view this movie so to let the haunting images fill you, and then never allow such a horrific thing to happen again. These dogs story needs to be told, so that their deaths are never, ever in vain and such tragedy is never allowed to ever happen again.  **In Beloved Memory of the Magnificent 15:  Anko (3 years old), Jack (4 years old), Riki (Lead dog - 6 years old), Shiro (6 years old), Kuma (5 years old), Deri (6 years old), which were the six dogs that went missing; Goro (Wheel dog - 6 years old), Besu, Moku, Aka, Kuro, Bochi, Kuma, which were the seven dogs that died chained, immobile, and starving; and Taro and Jiro, which were the two survivors of whom statues and legends were made.",1152316800,12,2641,4.59447983014862

Amazing story, scenery, and very close to real events in 1958.  Now I purchased a dvd-recorder and I converted to dvd, because is out of print.  So far in japan is available in dvd.  I hope after the release of 8below, studios make available ""Antarctica"" again in DVD with extras.  After watch 8below, Antarctica is much better, and deep heart emotions.

1201341,5,B00000F25K,"I came across this film 4 years ago in a video store in Australia. I rented it purely because I have a facination with everything Antarctic and Arctic. When I watched this film it touched me so deeply I was over due returning it for 2 months. It's a remarkable story about survival and highlights how ignoring your deep gut instinct can have consequences. Definitely worth having, can't wait for it to come out on DVD.",1140220800,9,418,4.5131578947368425
1201342,5,B00000F25K,"I first stumbled across this movie quite by accident while living in Italy.  It must have been somewhere between 1992 and 1994.  But when I saw this, it was absolutely frustrating, as it was a Japanese film dubbed in Italian, which I did not have a great understanding of at the time.  All I could do was watch the film and guess at a lot of what was happening.  But I was held, unmoving for the duration.  I wrote down all the information I possibly could from the credits at the end, hoping to find this movie once I returned to the States.  I wanted to see this again, after being so moved by it's content.  I never have been able to find it and as with most things, in time had forgotten about it.  Only now, with Disney's new movie, 8 Below coming out, I was stirred to recall this movie and wondered immediately if this was, in fact, the true story the new movie says it is being based.  I believe it is, but cannot see how anyone can do this original film any better.  I want so much to own my own copy of this, still, after all these years and hope so much that it will be made on DVD for so many more people to have access.  Perhaps all the hype for the new movie will stir someone to their senses to redo this movie in a larger venue for many more to enjoy.  One can only hope, as I remember all too well, the two dogs who survived, Taro and Jiro, and some of the other 7 who died, and the 6 that were never found........Jack, age 4; Kuma, age 5; Garo, age 6, Riki, age 6; Dehi, age 6; Shiro, age 3; Anko, age 3 and Shuma.  I never understood why these dogs were left chained together, as this seemed a certain death, as upposed to being left to roam free, once the Japanese had left them, as Taro and Jiro were.  It has always haunted and puzzled me, since many more of these animals may have survived, had they been free to choose their fate.  It seemed cruel, but I thought the men had wanted them to be safe, and by forcing them to remain together, thought they were doing the right thing.  What a mistake!  Sometimes I believe dogs are much smarter than humans.  What a great movie to have stayed in so many minds so long after the credits have rolled!!  Bravo!!  FANTASTIC!",1139356800,22,2189,4.130023640661938
1201343,5,B00000F25K,"With the release of Disney's new movie, ""8 Below"" I can only hope that people search to find the story that inspired it. I hope people become interested enough to want to learn more and therefore watch Antarctica. This movie is such a poignant tale of survival. While much of the movie speculates on what happened to these dogs, it stirs your heart. This is a 5 tissue movie at least. I first watched it on TV as a child and have been looking for it ever since. I've now watched it many times and still cry.",1138752000,16,507,4.237113402061856

It is breathtakingly beautiful and the content is soul stirrring. Even if you are not a dog lover this film is riviting. It truely touched me in a way so few films do.  I am so surprised that it has not received more recognition here in the States. Now that Hollywood is coming out with their version (which I am having a hard time beliving will even come close to this excellence))I am hoping that this will be made into DVD format.

Finally and unbelievably I just got my DVD copy on Amazon.it ! For about $10 my sister shipped it to me with some other stuff. Unfortunately for all of you out there looking for this film in DVD there are only two things that will allow you to get your copy: first you have to understand italian and second you need to have a multi region DVD player at home. This DVD is made for Italy so the only spoken language is italian and it is a Pal video not NTSC.
I actually have been able to find this movie on Amazon. UK as well and it seems they have it in both italian and english language but in Pal video version only. Also available on Amazon Spain in italian and english.
If you already posses a multi region DVD player then get the movie and you are done!.

7906572,2,B00000F25K,"Please do not misinterpret the poor rating I am giving this blu-ray. The film is absolutely fantastic, even 30 years after its release. Very emotional without being silly, it shows a real affection for these poor dogs and the ordeal they went through, without trying to humanise them. Furthermore, I do not know the picture quality of this blu-ray; I am just assuming it is at least all right.

No, my huge complaint goes to the fact that this is the ONLY edition of this great film and it has ONLY Japanese subtitles on it, reffering&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/to-this-edition/dp/B00CTHTKMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">to this edition</a>. I am fine with the Japanese soundtrack, since I always watch films in their original language. I also understand that a Japanese edition would not include an English (or whatever foreign language) soundtrack. However, I need to follow what is going on screen, what the characters are saying, and the subtitles are the only way (and not the most exepensive for the publisher, I might add) to accomplish that. I would gladly have paid 30 or 35 bucks for this film in HD, but the only Japanase subtitles killed that for me.

Too bad. Let us hope that, someday, we will be given a HD edition that anyone can watch and enjoy. This wonderful film deserves no less.",1433894400,,1346,5.141552511415525
