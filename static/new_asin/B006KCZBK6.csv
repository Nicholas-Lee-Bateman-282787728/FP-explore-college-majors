5000587,5,B006KCZBK6,"Chris Elliott is back, and the show is quite good.  Having CINEMAX comedy specials in the late 1980's and mingled with his many hilarious appearances on Letterman, along with his brilliant TV series ""Get A Life"" and the underrated ""Cabin Boy"", it is truly good to have Elliott back!  ""Eagleheart"" is a fully realized Chris Elliott comedy program on Cartoon Network's Adult-Swim.  Each episode is a short-subject comedy of roughly 15 minutes, and Chris Elliott is in violently entertaining Chuck Norris-mode with an excellent support cast and a great many bizarre story lines that fit perfectly with Chris Elliott's brand of humor.  The complete first season equals roughly two hours of weird.

The bonus features are a bit lacking though, BUT THE EPISODE COMMENTARIES SURE ARE SWELL!  Some of the edited scenes throughout season one are available as an additional bonus feature, but all the funniest stuff made it onto the show.  For the curious, the original pilot is also available in bits and pieces, and thank god season two is now upon us!",1334620800,20,1044,4.9655172413793105

5000589,1,B006KCZBK6,I must have missed something in the description of this show.  Darn that's $2.15 wasted.  It was dumb and really a waste of the 10min I was able to watch.,1380067200,,154,4.1

Don't even think I'd loan you mine.  Season two-season two-season two; where are you?",1378684800,2,372,4.661538461538462
5000592,2,B006KCZBK6,"it would be this.

also, why does almost every (like all but one) synopsis include the word ""shock"", "" shocked"", or ""shocking""?",1377648000,,127,4.7727272727272725
5000593,1,B006KCZBK6,"Saw this show and thought it might be interesting.  $2.99 and 12 minutes later I realized that these are just short snippets.  Thought I'd purchased an hour or at least 48 minutes of entertainment.  Now if it had only been funnier, I wouldn't feel ripped off.  On the bright side, it made my wife's night seeing the look on my face when the closing credits rolled.",1374192000,2,364,4.46969696969697
5000594,5,B006KCZBK6,"Instead of recapping an outline of Eagleheart (others have done far better than I could) all I can say is that this DVD is worth it simply because you can watch each episode many times and never tire of them.

I have watched several on a loop and laugh harder each time.

The show is fast moving and there is never a dull moment.

I love the So You Want to be a Marshall episode---especially the part where Chris speaks of ""the purelle"" followed by the great contrived laugh.

Chris Elliot is a comic treasure!  And the supporting cast and various guest stars are phenomenal.",1374192000,,575,4.438095238095238
5000595,1,B006KCZBK6,One star is way more than deserved. I lasted a very painful long two minutes! As bad a opener as I have ever experienced. If Amazon gave refunds I would demand one.,1369785600,2,164,4.15625
5000596,5,B006KCZBK6,"I bought this dvd at walmart. been a big fan since season one, the acting, the comedy, everything is clasic Chris Eliot. I really hope they keep this series going, i really love watching this program.",1367539200,,200,4.583333333333333
5000597,5,B006KCZBK6,"Okay, that may be stretching it.  I have to say, though, Chris Elliott again is phenomenal! I was laughing vigorously in the first seconds of the first see of the first episode.  Each episode is short, and hence the ""plots"" and jokes are uninterrupted with finer cinematic pauses, or whatever makes some dramas seem so long and drawn out.  It also is so packed, that I have watched much of it many times, still enjoying everyone of them.  So this is not DVD that one buys, watches once and then stashes on a shelf or drops off at Goodwill.

Other than gratuitous blood (Chris Elliott makes blood funny), the show is almost shockingly devoid of searing, sexuality, and other typical Hollywood shock tactics.  Probably won't watch it with my five year old, but have made my mom watch it with me several times. (okay, she rolled her eyes for most of it, but I'm still laughing out loud)",1366848000,2,883,4.556962025316456
5000598,1,B006KCZBK6,"Tripped up by the hazy general description of the series and never having seen anything by the producers...i bought the first episode. It was so bad I just turned it off after about 3 minutes. It's a spoof at about the 13 year old level: Blood, gore, prat falls into spinning aircraft propellor, etc. Don't waste your money.",1366070400,3,324,4.603448275862069
5000599,4,B006KCZBK6,"I like this show.  It is not as good as ""Get a Life"", a previous show starring Chris Elliot.  It is what you would expect from Adult Swim.  Silly, outrageous, fun.",1365638400,,163,4.193548387096774

5000602,5,B006KCZBK6,"This show scares some people because it can be very weird, by today's vapid norms. If you want to laugh at something that somebody actually had to think up, this is for you. Unless you don't like Chris Elliot.",1360368000,2,209,4.384615384615385
5000603,5,B006KCZBK6,Eagleheart is ridiculous. Ridiculously funny that is. The plots are laugh-out-loud ridiculous and corny but the cast really makes it work and the laughs just keep on coming!,1360195200,2,173,5.214285714285714

5000609,5,B006KCZBK6,"If you love Chris Elliott, then buy this immediately!  Absolutely Chris at his best.

As you can imagine, if Elliott is writing, then you're in for some crazy stuff.....",1348531200,2,284,4.529411764705882

5000612,5,B006KCZBK6,I have been a fan of Chris Elliott since Get a Life in the early 90's.  Eagleheart is great if you appreciate his style of comedy and feels like a version of Get a Life with violence and action.  It is hilarious!,1341360000,12,212,4.023809523809524

5000614,5,B006KCZBK6,"I love this show! I have been waiting for the 1st Season to come out on DVD. If you're looking for a good laugh this comical genius will not disappoint you. Chris Eliot takes his comical genius to a new level with this comical parody. Worth every penny, can't wait for season 2 to come out on DVD! Well, once the show has completed its second season.

5000615,5,B006KCZBK6,"I never knew about this show until I watched a clip of Sam Elliot on Conan. I thought he was hilarious, as well as the clip from season two of his show Eagleheart. Afterward I was curious to see how much season one was. Thankfully it was super cheap so I took a gamble and bought it. THANKFULLY! I did. One of the best shows I have seen in awhile. Also my new favorite show on Adult Swim, which is saying a lot in my opinion. If you enjoy Aqua teen of old or anything with dark humor I guarantee you will love this show. I know I did. 5/5 would bang repeatedly.",1336608000,6,561,3.9734513274336285
5000616,5,B006KCZBK6,"Am I only dreaming? Or is this burning an eternal flaaaaaaame. I love everything about this show. I may, in fact, have been predetermined to love this show and yet, still, it has surpassed my every expectation. It's got gratuitous violence, and more importantly, gratuitous nonsense. Chris Elliot's Walker Texas Ranger-inspired character, Chris Monsanto, has at least 3 different origin stories over the course of the DVD. Continuity is out the window, anything to propel the weirdness into new realms of funny. This is the Enterprise and you are the crew. Get to finding those planets full of creepy marionettes, you whacko.",1335916800,6,625,5.137254901960785

The humor is similar to the other shows mentioned, but the over the top violence, randomness and sociopathic nature of the lead characters made it a favorite of mine.

 Chris Elliot has always been underrated (Cabin Boy) and he really shines as the satirical embodiment of Walker Texas Ranger and every role Steven Seagal has ever played. The other characters are very enjoyable and compliment the style of humor very well. The show is short and sweet; which is part of its charm. Nothing is dragged out or filler. This is the sort of stuff I throw in the dvd player when I'm with my girlfriend, am to lazy to go out and need something light yet entertaining.

As a Chris Elliott fan going back to his show ""Get a life"" and movie ""Cabin Boy"", I was anticipating with great excitement the arrival of Eagleheart on Adult Swim.  I remember feeling somewhat disappointed after the first episode, but as the season went on it got funnier and funnier.  If you're not a fan of Elliott's absurd, whimsical and downright silly humor, this show isn't for you.  However, Elliott fans will love this series if they stick with it for a few shows.  I'm saddened that they haven't released the subsequent seasons on dvd, but do appreciate that I can watch them on Adult Swim's website for free.",1407974400,,638,4.610619469026549
