8106864,1,B000E795XM,This thing looks like the worlds worst home movie done in some guys basement. Not to mention he gives the worst instructions and doesn't even seem to believe what he is saying. If there were stars in the negative scale I would rate it there. This isn't even worth a penny,1397952000,2,271,4.333333333333333
8106865,5,B000E795XM,"For the beginner, David Wilhite does a nice job of explaining the game over the course of approx 30 minutes. I was pleased with it and found it to be very helpful. I'm sure there are more complex area of Blackjack, but for the small time gambler looking to have a good time and not go flat broke, the DVD offers several practice hands and David walks you through the decision process. He also gives tips on money management, when to split, double down, buy insurance, etc. Very well done in my opinion, but this is the only blackjack DVD I have seen, so I cannot compare it to the more expensive DVDs out there.",1141257600,5,611,4.321739130434783
