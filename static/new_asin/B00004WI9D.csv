7925460,5,B00004WI9D,"Nicholas' Gift is a must-have for any family movie collection! It is a powerful story of sacrifice, forgiveness, and faith at a time when most people would not be thinking about those things. When the family vacation to Italy takes a really bad turn, the family's simple decision and choices lead to a positive outcome for all. This movie also tells the story of both organ donation and organ transplantation from the sides of both the donor family and the recipient, unique to stories of organ transplants (which are almost always one sided - from the donor's family's side or from the recipient's side). Definitely a movie worth watching!",1373500800,,640,4.8807339449541285
