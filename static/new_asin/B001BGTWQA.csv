3493553,3,B001BGTWQA,"We watched Rest Stop because we love Jamie Alexander in Blindspot on TV.  She carried the whole movie, the other actors were okay.  It got a bit far fetched as it moved along but most horror flicks do.  The people in the camper didn't really fit well with the rest of the movie although I do get the connection because what they said to Nicole.",1467590400,,344,4.2615384615384615

3493563,5,B001BGTWQA,"This is one of the scariest horror movies I've ever seen. It's kind of realistic and is very, very creepy.",1445817600,,106,4.35
3493564,3,B001BGTWQA,"It is a good B movie. Kind of the Hitcheresque. It is not the best movie in the world but I have watched it on more than one occasion. I believe I originally saw it on Scy fy or Chilller. There is a decent story but at times it is not clear. It must have done ok  because they made a 2. Acting is decent. Don't expect more than it is. It is a B movie good for wasting some time, no deep thought needed. There are kills and blood just to be that. Hope you like it",1438992000,,462,3.7142857142857144

3493568,5,B001BGTWQA,"Jaimie Alexander has one of those great Scream Queen faces that shows both suffering and hatred oh so well...and the myth created here (which gets botched a bit in the second film) of the truck driver and the RV is really chilling. The imagery of despair, from the writing on the wall of the restroom stall to the sheaves of missing person notices is unforgettable. I love this one which, like the Pact, hybridizes serial killer with the supernatural.",1416441600,,451,4.7215189873417724

8283249,2,B001BGTWQA,This is a lesson in how not to make a scary movie . I found myself hitting pause every few minutes just so I could how much longer it had left . Rest Stop has complete lack of character development combined with a plot thinner then tissue paper .  It varies at times between being silly and just downright stupid .,1501459200,,314,4.147540983606557

8283251,1,B001BGTWQA,Just not good. Bad acting all the way around. Anyone who said lead actress was good is a huge lie. Could be worse but not by much.,1487376000,,130,3.8518518518518516

8283254,1,B001BGTWQA,"omg this movie was pretty bad. The only good thing is the actress is pretty. That's about it, had great potential but just poorly executed.",1483747200,,139,4.6
8283255,4,B001BGTWQA,Still weird and spooky after subsequent viewings,1483401600,,48,6.0
