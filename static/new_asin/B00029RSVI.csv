8025023,4,B00029RSVI,"Horror Hotel has lots of atmosphere. Which means FOG all over the place! Dark caverns and hooded spooky cult members make this a Gothic-Tinged delight! Sure, you can check in...But don't plan on leaving the Horror Hotel! The Bat has Vincent Price, Master of American Horror in the late 1950's~1973. The Gorilla is one of many Ape-Themed Horror flicks of the 1930's,40's,50's and 60's. In all, it's a great Retro Rewind of Horror you might have missed at a frighteningly cheap price!",1372204800,,482,4.890243902439025
8025024,2,B00029RSVI,Really low budget and amateurish. Watched all three but they could not hold my concentration for any period of time,1364428800,,115,4.8
8025025,2,B00029RSVI,"I watched the Horror Hotel,but i didn't get a chance to watch the bat or the gorilla. All the movies are Black and White, but they have a very high dvd quality picture. There is a logo at the bottom right of the screen for about 5 minutes at the beginning and the movie wasn't very scary. It's still interesting to watch if you get it cheap.",1175731200,,341,4.104477611940299
