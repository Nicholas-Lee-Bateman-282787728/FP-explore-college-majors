1080408,5,6305812772,If you liked the first volume of trigun you will like this one. The story is more continuos and it starts to reviele more. I can't wait for the others. If you buy this one and the first one you are gonna have to shell  out the money to buy the other 6 volumes because you are gonna get hooked.  Vash is a great protagonist. He seems goofy anf clumsey but it is all skill  behind his actions. The only thing I didn't like was how this volume ended.,960163200,5,447,4.0
1080409,5,6305812772,"After I saw the first volume of Trigun and loved it, I knew I had to get the second. If you're expecting more complete silliness and insanity like the first four episodes, you're going to get it. But the plot is beginning  to take form, and there are some sad as well as serious moments. We get a  more in depth look into the real Vash, and he is majorly AWESOME ^_^! This  tape has 3 episodes on it, and a lot of commercials for other cool anime  AFTER the video, not before. Just wait a little. They look cool and most of  them have music well worth hearing. So, hopefully enjoy. This is a video  well worth buying.",960076800,2,617,4.142857142857143
1080496,5,6305812772,"this is just so sweet since you get so many extras like orignal artwork from the creator, an exclusive keychain, a great case and some of the coolist episodes in the series.  It is just SWEET.",1142899200,2,192,4.333333333333333
1080497,5,6305812772,I didn't used to like the last half of this series.  But recently I rewatched it and was glad I did.  Few anime will match Trigun for the intensity and drama.  This is a must have for anyone wanting an action filled series.,1141689600,3,223,4.1395348837209305
1080498,4,6305812772,This second half of Trigun was good but unlike the first half which was extremely funny and light hearted.  The second half was so very heart wrecking having to watch Vash break down and cry bitterly through out all of the deaths of various characters.  Being so depressing with little comedy to break up the mood it makes it a hard series to watch over and over.,1140739200,3,363,4.402985074626866
1080499,4,6305812772,"The first volume of Trigun was mostly pure, sometimes gratuitous fun as goofy, ostentatiously klutzy wanted gunman Vash the Stampede got himself in and out of trouble, often dragging entire towns down with him. In this second volume, a plot very slowly beings to appear, as Vash's past is hinted at. It's still not enough to base anything on, but it keeps the viewer hooked with promises of revelations to come. Also, moral themes such as responsability and redemption are gradually brought up.

There's still enough goofiness to keep us smiling, however. Vash is still largely a lecherous klutz, which is always fun, although it's a relief to see him begin to uncover his more serious, more noble side, as 26 episodes of hysterics like the ones constantly seen in the first volume would undoubtedly have gotten annoying. Vash keeps getting more and more endearing. Milly and Meryl, the insurance girls, become slightly more interesting, as Meryl takes part actively in a few gunfights (in a pretty stylish way, too) and Milly reveals she's not always as ditzy as she looks. The only thing that's missing is a good villain, as the ones encountered so far have been pretty stereotypical; it seems like they've only been created so that Vash can take them down (which is probably the case). Still, everything in its own time.

I only put 4 stars because of the afore-mentioned minor flaws and because of one VERY cheesy episode, in which a girl tries to take her revenge on Vash. It's not an entirely useless episode, as we get to see an important flashback into Vash's past, but the way the whole crisis was resolved made me roll my eyes. Also, I only put 4 stars because I just watched the third volume, and that one really blew me away!",1100131200,,1737,4.7105263157894735
1080500,5,6305812772,"The man in red with the spiky hair continues his adventures as the insurance girls again run into him. Vash the Stampede, the walking one man destruction machine continues his adventures in search of love and peace in this series.

Hard Puncher-  Vash is again attempted to be captured for his reward, this time by an entire town. This episode is memorable because it's the first time we see Vash fire a gun, finally showing why he's considered such a spectacular gunman. We also find out that Vash still has unfinished business with someone and won't have peace until he finds that person. It's also the first time Meryl finally believes that Vash is who everyone says he is.

Lost July- A beautiful engineer comes to the town and it seems she holds Vash responsible for the destruction of the town of July and her parents' death. There's a very touching scene at the end where Vash shows a little of his heart and just how compassionate he is. He also seems to be not quite human with something he does in the building that's about to explode.

B.D.N.- On a speeding train, Vash tries to protect a young orphan while also out smarting the bandits who have taken over the train. It's also the introduction of Rem, a woman who seems to haunt Vash.

And Between the Wasteland and the Sky- The second part of a cliffhanger, Vash is challenged to a one on one duel with the leader of the bandits, which is complicated by the fact that the train is still out of control and heading toward a cliff.

As the series builds, Vash becomes even more endearing as the seemingly bumbling, but ultimately highly intelligent and thoughtful hero. It's hard to dislike him as he wins everyone over with compassion and humor and a genuine good spirit.",1099008000,,1734,4.559485530546624
1080501,4,6305812772,"This video contains episodes 5-8 of the series.  Essentailly, it contains two two-parters that begin to open up the continuity of the series.  These episodes also begin to take on a darker, more sinister tone.
The first two episodes revolve around an entire town that sets out to capture Vash and collect the reward on his head in order to save their town.  The writing is very good, drawing the townspeople as good people put into an impossible situation.  The real Vash begins to emerge here, as well - the good-hearted wanderer who lives to promote love and peace and takes pains to avoid hurting anyone.  Part one ends with a wonderful action sequence and Vash declaring the world made of 'love and peace.'  One of the memorable moments of the series.
Part two, ""Lost July"" is one of my favorite episodes.  Vash's mysterious past begins to unfold when a woman from his past (sort of) comes to get revenge on the man who she believes destroyed her town.  The episode ends with her weeping in Vash's arms, unable to reconcile the destroyer of July with the gentle, unselfish man she meets.  Emotionally satisfying.
The other two episodes detail Vash's confrontation with Brillance Dynamite Neon and his gang.  That BDN is not one of the strangest villians in this show says quite a bit about the level of creativity here.  Not as good as the previous episodes, but better than the first batch.  This two-parter is essentially Die Hard on a train, serving up some nifty action sequences and situations, and giving us our first glance of Rem Savrem.  Reccommended.",1056758400,,1564,4.7481481481481485
1080502,5,6305812772,Trigun keeps on being a great series. I can't wait to get them all. I enjoy the thoughts or qoutes at the end of the previews for the next show. I hope this series will keep being low on langauge and violence.,1038009600,,209,4.0
1080503,5,6305812772,"Even though there are only 3 episodes on here, none of them are fillers. They all play an important part in the series, especially ""Lost July"", which gives us a glimpse into Vash's past, and shows the fact that he certainly isn't an ordinary man.
""B.D.N."" is quite a stylish episode, with a very ""luminous"" set of foes. If you see this, you will definitely buy the 3rd DVD to see how it turns out because..yes.. it's a cliffhanger.",999820800,,431,4.468354430379747
1080504,5,6305812772,"After evading being actually tagged as Vash: the Stampede, our hero (such as he is) is revealed and even Merril is convinced, though not exactly happy about it.  Thus revealed an entire town tries to kill him, one family with a combined height of 40 feet shows up, another beautiful woman who manages to sweep Vash right of his feet, and the dark side.  Vash has a past that is starting to catch up with him.  Things just get even more topsie-turvy in this installment, but what can you expect with $$60,000,000,000 on your head.
The humor is just as good as the in the first volume and the action is even more fun to watch.  To tell you the truth I'm a little upset because now I'm going to buy the rest of the series.  It isn't exactly cheap at [price] a DVD, and now there are only three epsiodes per DVD until the finale in volume 8, or so I hear.  Either way, if you've got the coin and you loved the first one, the second one won't let you down.",996537600,,951,4.169398907103825
1080505,4,6305812772,"This DVD adds more details and background to the character known as Vash, however, for those who have viewed the first DVD and wondered, ""Who is this guy and where did he come from?"" hold on, you will still have to wait.
You WILL see that he can be deadly serious when pushed and that there is a very deep compassionate side to this character.  Even so, the lightheartedness shown in the first DVD is very much present here.
Having watched most of this show on TV, while living in Japan, I can say that the series as a whole does not disappoint and that it is definetely worth it to get the whole collection and watch them in order.  The character development is quite well orchestrated and leaves you waiting for each new revelation.
One last note, having watched most Japanese anime in Japan, I've found that many translations suffer.  While this is still the case with the subtitles on this DVD, I feel that it comes closer than many.  I have not watched it with spoken English, so have not determined if the subtitles are different or not.  Either way, I would highly recommend this as a purchase, whether or not you're just getting into anime or just looking for something new and entertaining.",992822400,,1199,4.532407407407407

1080535,5,6305812772,"Well, if you are reading this, then you must have already seen the first volume, ""The $$60 Billion Man"".
You won't be disappointed.  BUT from now on there are only three episodes per DVD (except for the last volume).
Everyone says that this DVD is some sort of turning point, but it really isn't.  The action gets upped a bit, but it still has a lot of great humor in it.  The story doesn't really get much more serious until Vol. 4 (the halfway point).

I'm hooked; this series grabbed me from the start and is still holding me strong!  What's so great about this second DVD?  More western, outlaw, gunslingin', comedy/action, and as always with this series, a great time!  A little bit of Vash's mysterious past is revealed and more questions about him arise, and will leave you guessing all night.  Definitely not a series to pass up, go get it NOW!",982540800,,510,4.440860215053763
1080538,5,6305812772,"If you loved the first tape, I'm sure you'll love the second.
Vash, our spiky, blonde-headed gunslinging hero is back in ""Lost Past"". Before I start droning on and on (therefore making you sit here for hours), let me tell you the only thing that bummed me out about this volume. 3... episodes... Urgh. That's really the only downside...
In my humble opinion, ""Hard Puncher"" is the best episode in the volume, mainly, because it's the first time we ever get to see Vash fire his revolver (discounting the intro movie at the start of every episode, and the time where Vash tries to take out a few bounty hunters in the first volume, and is out of ammo ^^;;;) .
We get to see a little hint of how angry Vash can just be. (Which is vaguely frightening. Well, maybe that's just me, but still.) Turns out that, aside from being a ditz, Vash is actually not entirely a soft-hearted person, and actually will kill to get out of a fix. (That is, if he's driven over the edge, which is shown in ""Hard Puncher""... well, at least a little bit. But this is only at drastic measures.)
I was a bit disappointed that this volume was a bit more serious then the first (You have to love those hijinks. ^^)- I was expecting a bit more comedy, although there's enough to go around. (The ketchup scene is most likely the funniest, but I won't spoil it for you.)
Reguardless, you don't have to fear about wasting your money, this volume is just as good as the first. So get out there and see it. (This coming from the person who's hooked more then 10 friends on it.)

1080540,4,6305812772,"Trigun, vol. 2: Lost Past, though dubbed, was still an excellent title. The dubbing, while it can't compare to the dubbing of Princess Mononoke,  was decently performed. In this volume, a bit more of Vash's past is  revealed, though not enough to actually understand. He's also still being  followed by those two insurance agents. It seems like there could be a  possible relationship in store for Vash and a very jealous insurance woman.  This volume contains a very large enemy for Vash to face, as well as a ride  on a huge train gone bad... This volume is also filled with ""Love and  peace!"".",965088000,,596,4.673076923076923
1080541,5,6305812772,"in the first tape it seems like deep down Vash is brave, but when he realizes what he is doing he chickens out and is a coward... but that's only in the fist tape, in the second one he actually shoots some, if you  look closely you can see him use his second of his three guns (hence the  name TRIgun) and he appears to be quite a bit braver and not so much a  geek... and you actually peek into the past... not a big peek, i expect  that in future episodes, but it is still a peak... if you are afraid of  spending money without seeing it... borrow it from a friend... and then buy  it..",961804800,8,588,3.940677966101695

a current anime series that is popular, Naruto and the second part Naruto Shippuden, the music in in Naruto Shippuden around episode 100+ has some guitar chords

Here he is again, just minding his own business in an Inperil City bar when another group of thugs with the $60 billion reward on their minds comes barging in to kill him. Vash takes them out no problem, but then finds that the ENTIRE city wants to take him down. Even kids are pulling out guns! At one time Inperil was a prosperous city centered around a Lost Technology power plant, but it broke and the city began to wither and die. They want to claim Vash's head so they can pay for the expensive specialists that can reignite the power plant's energy source. Realizing that even an entire city is no match for Vash, the local sherrif lets the Nebraska Brothers out of prison. In a send up of giant robots, one brother is a mad scientist type who rides on his godzilla sized cyborg brother who can shoot his fist like a chained rocket launcher. Unfortunately for Inperil, the Nebraska Brothers do not care how much property is destroyed or how many Inperilities are killed in the pursuit of Vash.

I did not like the first volume of this series at all. In fact, if I hadn't checked the first three volumes of this show out from my local library, I would not have watched this second installment. But since it was free, I was like, ""what the hell"". I was really surprised with Lost Past. I really liked these 3 episodes. I guess sticking with a show past the first volume really does pay off sometimes. What changed my mind about Trigun? Maybe I got used to Vash's personality and humor, and I started finding some of his mannerisms and dialogue funny. Like when he shoots a whole gang of bounty hunters with toy gun darts before they can even draw their guns. I think what really made the show turn around was that the writers made these episodes form a continuity which flowed together whereas Volume 1 seemed disjointed and unconnected. I also was intrigued by Vash's mysterious past, driven home by the fact that he cannot remember the city he supposedly destroyed to earn the price on his head. I know Vash is more than he seems, but his origin is a mystery I really want to solve.

The fact that this volume contains only 3 episodes is a bit of a rip-off that could not be pulled today. Just ask Bandai (They tried selling dvds with ONE episode!). But this was par for the anime course back in the day. Since the Trigun show is not really a current show, you should be able to find the dvds pretty easily and at low cost.",1246406400,,2469,4.3769063180827885

The insurance girls continue to follow him even though Vash advises them not to and he finishes off the rest of the Gungho Guns and he is challenged with Legato with the power of choice and free will.  He goes against what he doesn't want to do most and that's to kill another (see someone die).  He learns to keep surviving...The death of Wolfwood (which was a very emotional, yet touching scene) was strong on his mind, but he keeps him close in his thoughts and his cross gun saves him from his brother pulling the trigger.  Vash may have got revenge, yes, but he see's Rem in somebody...Meryle reminds a man that wants to kill Vash for the death of his family to not take the life of another man.  She opens her arms and approaches him with open arms and speaks the words of taking the life of another is never a choice to come to.  Vash then learns to keep surviving even though you sometimes have to harm those that have harmed you in such a way that tears you apart deep down inside.  The last couple episodes spoke to me throughout the suspenseful battles and emotions of the characters and I'm sure it's spoken to many other fans out there as well.  Keep surviving and keep your vision clear to see the future...That's what Vash does after he silences his brother's life for taking Rem away from him.  There may be a lot of anime fans that are into the high action and excitement, which is necessary, yes, but Trigun is an important series from start to finish...I respect the show for the message that is given to you at the end.  Wolfwood's scene is definitely something to remember as it hits with emotion and real feeling, along with Vash and the Insurance girls.
