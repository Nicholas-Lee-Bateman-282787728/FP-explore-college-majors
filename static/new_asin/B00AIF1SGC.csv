5431412,5,B00AIF1SGC,"As an aspiring baker, I found the explanations and demonstrations very easy to understand.  Not too basic and not too high level.  Perfect for a home baker who is looking to improve their techniques.  Anne is fun to watch and explains things well.  I love, love, love all the creative and beautiful cakes she and her team make (see her website).  So I was very excited when she decided to make these videos so we can all learn from her amazing talent.",1360886400,,451,4.451219512195122
5431413,5,B00AIF1SGC,"I've watched many, many tutorials in my effort to improve my ability and I would put both of Anne's new DVD's at the top of my ""Recommended"" list.  The information is given in clear, step by step detail that is easy to follow if you are a beginner and filled with little tricks of the trade if you are more experienced.  Her double cake board trick is great and is a good enough reason on its own to buy the DVD. But there are a few more tidbits offered that you'll wonder how you did without.  I would definitely recommend both of these DVD's and hope Anne takes the time share more of her talent in future tutorials.",1360195200,,618,4.220338983050848
5431414,4,B00AIF1SGC,"I brought both DVD's. I like this one better than the other. Her work is great and I enjoyed this DVD however, I do not advise that she demonstrate that inserting wires into cake is acceptable because it's a big NO NO in the cake world. She works really well but in reality these techniques are nothing new which I figured out after purchasing both DVD's.",1359676800,,355,4.393939393939394
5431415,5,B00AIF1SGC,"I recently purchased cake 101&102, and they are exceptionally great and informative! Anne Heap is a great teacher- clear and precise, providing the detailed information that makes the difference between a polished, perfect cake and one that is merely okay. Her easy ""fix it"" tips for fondant flaws are fantastic, and very generous of her to share...so much great information - I loved them both!",1358899200,2,395,5.092307692307692

5431418,5,B00AIF1SGC,I've been following Pink Cake Box for years and jumped on the opportunity to order the DVD as soon as it came out.  I am in Florida and can't attend classes there so this is wonderful for those of us who are a little far away.  Excellent information and very nicely made.  I have many cake videos and this is one of the best made.  Can't wait to get the next ones :-),1357171200,,367,3.9863013698630136

8552164,5,B00AIF1SGC,I love these two discs(101 & 102).  Anne Heap is a great teacher.

8552168,5,B00AIF1SGC,"Cake 102 covers all of the important fundamentals and some great extras you need to know when fondanting and stacking cakes! Anne's teaching is easy to understand and since I have this DVD, I can go back and reference whenever I need to. There is an awesome bow-nus feature too which I had not seen her technique before.
