8191736,5,B000PHX7NU,"I was attracted to this DVD by the teaser, that Hanneke (pronounced like ""Hanukkah"") van Dam felt called to Mongolia before she even knew where to find it on the map!!  I am so glad I got it!  It won a Gold Crown Award for the Best Documentary Under $50,000 and won at the 2007 International Christian Visual Media Crown Awards.  Hanneke van Dam was working as a child psychologist for the court in Amsterdam when she heard Jackie Pullinger speak in 1995.  I read on Wikipedia that Jackie Pullinger has created a Christian ministry in Hong Kong that has helped over 500 drug addicts recover.  The next morning, while vacuuming her mother's house, Hanneke was praying that God direct her life, feeling an increased burden to do His service because of hearing Jackie Pullinger.  She received the thought ""Mongolia"", which she describes as being a stronger experience than her senses of hearing and sight.  She didn't even know what continent it was on and wasn't sure why her mind would focus on that as the location, but is convinced God gave her the thought.  For the 5 years before the documentary was made, she worked in the capital city of Ulan Bator under the sponsorship of HELP International.  The documentary chronicles her journeys after feeling led in her spirit to evangelize in other regions of the Mongolian steppes.

Throughout this documentary, we explore with her the social situation in Mongolia, the challenges of church-planting and church-sustaining, and the personal cost of being a traveling missionary.  Mongolia is larger than France, Germany, Italy, and the UK combined and has about 2.8 million people, 50% of which are in the capital, Ulan Bator, the coldest capital city in the world.  80% of the country's men have drinking problems.  This documentary chronicles her ministry to regions outside the capital city, as she attempts to disciple believers to carry on after she has to move on, and prays for and witnesses healing miracles.  It also strongly conveys the cost and blessing of missions.  She explains her love for the people of Mongolia and her bittersweet feelings of opportunity and sorrow about uprooting her life every several months to move on to another area.  The central narrative of the documentary is a couple which is relatively new to the Christian faith and backslides while she is gone, and the documentary is equally focused on the mixed feelings she has about so many aspects of her life.  She feels blessed to be God's evangelist, and desires for more missionaries to come to Mongolia to create and sustain healthy churches.  She feels like everyone takes a piece of her because she is in such demand among the people, and hates leaving areas because it's hard to keep saying goodbye--but says she never has regretted taking this bittersweet package of being a missionary.  It's a job that needs to be done, and she loves the Mongolian people and acknowledges that she could never feel comfortable living back in Holland again.

It is good to hear from her about the challenges that inevitably come from being a traveling missionary who is single.  She is a modern-day equivalent in many ways to the Apostle Paul, and it is important to hear about the cost of missions so we can pray for others, including for her, and better know how to set priorities in our own lives.  In this approximately 50-minute DVD, I have been very blessed.",1373328000,2,3388,4.835355285961872
8191737,5,B000PHX7NU,Excellent documentary on life of missionary and reward and cost of following Christ. Very inspirational movie that would work well for missionary and women's groups as well as personal use.,1292544000,2,189,5.333333333333333
8191738,5,B000PHX7NU,"My 11 year old daughter and I were INSPIRED and challenged after watching Journey Into the Unknown...the day in the life of a modern day missionary in Mongolia.  My daughter has been studying Mongolia in her history lessons as part of her homeschool studies and we had an up close and personal view of the current physical, emotional and spiritual needs of the people of Mongolia.  As a family we have enjoyed reading many classic missionary stories like Hudson Taylor, Gladys Aylward, George Mueller, Bruschko, Jim Elliot, and Eric Liddell but we were inspired by a current look at the sacrificial life of faith and love displayed in this documentary.  The missional need is great in Mongolia and we will have a permanent picture of this need branded on our hearts which brings us to our knees in prayer for the souls of the Mongolian people.
