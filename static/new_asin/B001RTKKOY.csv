3778614,3,B001RTKKOY,I think whoever writes the covers and descriptions for movies needs to actually watch the movie before they write.  Again the description and the cover are no clue to the contents of the movie.  The cover gives you the impression that the girl between Clifton Powell and Vivica Fox is a homewrecker not their child.  How is she a stranger if she is their daughter?  That suggests incest which is not what the movie is about. The movie is hard to describe because I'm still trying to figure out the whole point.  During two separate scenes two differnet men declare their undying love for the mother and daughter of the movie still the end is the family sitting down with a minister and realizing that they need to be together as a family.  Huh?  How does that follow from the love songs?  What was the point of the movie?  Vivica and Clifton acted very well in a movie that was ok at best.  It was not outstanding or inspiring or any of the other things you can normally say about gospel plays.  It was an exercise in confusion and that was all.,1255737600,4,1045,4.390625
3778615,4,B001RTKKOY,Not the quality of Tyler Perry but not cheesy either. Overall it was a pretty nice DVD.  I enjoyed it and it made me laugh a lot.  It was worth it.,1252713600,,147,3.7096774193548385
3778616,3,B001RTKKOY,"The story line was very weak and didn't make much sense to me (the mom kick's husband out because he is not there for her or her daughter, yet once he is gone the mom pays no attention to her child and suddenly she's whorish, too silly for me)only because of this I didn't enjoy the play, had there been a logical plot it would have been great.",1252627200,,344,4.073529411764706
3778617,1,B001RTKKOY,"I wish I could have given this dvd a ZERO!  This shouldn't get a single star.  It's a shame celebrities will associate themselves with such lame productions.  I guess the recession is hurting EVERYBODY.  Vivica's microphone makes her sound like she's talking on speakerphone the entire play.  The story line is pathetic and the singers look like they were told to go on stage and ""sing what ever you feel like singing.""",1251072000,10,419,4.763888888888889
3778618,1,B001RTKKOY,This movie was a total dudd.... don't buy it... Im warning you.... I bought it from target yesterday and I wanna wrap it back up and send it back to them... no good storyline... the girl practically had sex with one of her mothers boy toys and he used her but what really made me mad is the girl tries to black mail him for the job... and after he uses her she wants the job back...WTF? if my boss used me... i wouldnt want to work for him anymore....duh! Viveca fox was the mother who was dating alot of men but was having marital problems with her husband who was clifton powell(he is in every play) they had a daughter Harmony who was played by one of the girls who use to sing with the group xscape.... anyway she was so distraught over her parents pending divorce(Harmony looked too grown to be living at home and crying over her parents divorce.... Im just saying)....dont get the movie... If you do make sure you don't pay $10 like I did.... more like $ 1.50,1250899200,22,965,4.25

8338772,5,B001RTKKOY,I'm just a little confused by between some stuff that be going with through troubles of your family and/or made out a big mistake with someone in a business.,1420502400,,157,4.448275862068965
8338773,1,B001RTKKOY,This play had me so confused... What was the writer thinking it had no substance it was horrible could not sit and watch overally dramatic which made it horrible,1347148800,,161,4.586206896551724
8338774,4,B001RTKKOY,"So many times as women we forget that our home is our santuary. This is a good play to show some one step to intervention. Its good, and i would recomment buying this especially if there are ""minor"" problems at home and as a family we need to learn to stay together.",1329091200,2,266,4.134615384615385
8338775,1,B001RTKKOY,"The characters are over the top. The mom played by Vivica Fox is a floozie, sleeping around. The father is weak. Daughter, Harmony, is suffering about her parents divorce. From the opening dialogue you would think the daughter is a child. When she comes into the room, she looks older than Vivica Fox. Turns out she is 20. Why is she so upset about her parents divorce, she's a grown woman. Mom gets Harmony a job at the company of one of her boyfriends. Harmony calls in sick on the second day of work and gets fired. She then goes into the office after the boss calls her and she shows up dressed as a hooker, sleeps with the boss who then doesn't give her her job back. Later, she confronts the boss and lets him know that she knows his real name. (Where did this plot come from? Why does the boss have a fake name?) Anyhow, after confronting the boss and calling him Mike, he tries to kill her. Chokes her for a long time, but she doesn't die. She gets up and laughs then he backs down and she blackmails him into giving her the job. (Why didn't he kill her and end the play?) The play was an excuse for the former singers to sing. Madea would have fixed this mess.",1315094400,2,1169,4.2
8338776,2,B001RTKKOY,"I saw this after ""Whatever she wants"" with Vivica Fox, so I thought it would be worth my while to watch. Boy, was I wrong. The plot is very scattered, including bringing in random characters that were not properly introduced into the setting. What made me really upset is the part when she dressed like some 50 cent peep show into her job and acted as if the way she dressed would get a fair reaction from her chavinistic boss. (Shakes head). Plus, some singing was not necessary and the way it ended was just not right, certainly a cliffhanger. Do not waste your money on buying this because it is not worth the money or possibly your time.",1294272000,,641,4.394957983193278
8338777,1,B001RTKKOY,"Saw this on BET.  The characters in this play tried to hard to be something that they were not.  What is Vivica Fox doing? She looks really trampy and overweight in the green dress that she wears at the opening of the play.  Preston, the 20-something boyfriend of Vivica's 40ish mother-character, should be looking at Harmony.  Harmony also looks messy and like she should be living in her own apartment and not with her Momma.  Her voice is really nice, but she should not be crying over not being able to spend time with her Momma, but looking for a man.  Her friend Chelsey told her what she needed...a man to ""ring her bell"".  Harmony is still wearing her robe in the middle of the day. Devon tried, but...when she came downstairs dressed like a street-walker.  What kind of friends are they?  Said that Harmony had no positive role models in her life and talking about her Momma.  I stopped watching after 15 minutes.",1270339200,,922,4.567073170731708
8338778,5,B001RTKKOY,"This play is one all families should watch. There was an old saying when I grew up, ""Children learn what they live.""  This truly is the reflection of that. It reminds of us of what some of today's families are dealing with.  You can never say that won't happen in my house. Seeing this made me realize just how far from family and moral values we have gotten. The ending was even more BOMB!. Thank God for true friends. Who helped the family to get back to the source. GOD.  Thank You.",1265414400,,485,4.25
8338779,1,B001RTKKOY,This play is terrible. It's all over the place one minute the girl is talking about Jesus then the next she trying to sleep with someone. This play is terrible trust me save your money and spend it on something else!!!,1260835200,6,218,4.341463414634147
