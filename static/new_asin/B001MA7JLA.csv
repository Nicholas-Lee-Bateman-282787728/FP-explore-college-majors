8320794,3,B001MA7JLA,When I fist watched this DVD I was not impressed but after watching it again it grew on me. Watching Doug Stange pull catfish out of the ice or small water streams is fun and they even show you how to cook up some catfish. The DVD is mostly in-fisherman pulling out catfish and where to locate them. There is not much details about the systems or bait used and the chapter where they fish the Red River in a boat was kind of boring. This is still worth checking out for beginners but veterans should look at other DVD's.,1375142400,,520,4.21
