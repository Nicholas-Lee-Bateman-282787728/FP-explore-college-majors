8141549,5,B000HWXAGM,"I was lucky enough to participate in the Missouri portion of this film.  It was nostalgic, entertaining, informative and FUN.  I was part of the Corvette road run across Missouri.  We started in Pacific at the historic Red Cedar Inn restaurant in Pacific and ended at the Munger Moss Motel in Lebanon, where the rooms were decorated in the Route 66 motif.  Along the way we drove on the original Route 66 highway as much as possible, and we were able to see many old landmarks. The dedicated film crew filmed us along the way - not even stopping when one of the guys' glasses blew off when he was hanging out of his vehicle!  This film is a great combination of the old and new:  original film from when the girls were little, to the present.",1247788800,,742,4.37956204379562
8141550,5,B000HWXAGM,"I loved this documentary of the Larry family who traveled the ""Mother Road"" in the 1940's and 1950's. The screenwriter based the story on her own family's experiences and their original footage, along with film of a recent cross-country trip that she made with her siblings and camerapersons. They drove from LA to the family farm in Illinois, and back to California with side trips to the Grand Canyon and Chicago, retracing the family's journeys and having some fun times at Route 66 festivals along the way. I found it a charming, heart-warming story, unlike anything I've seen about Route 66.",1245628800,2,596,4.910891089108911
