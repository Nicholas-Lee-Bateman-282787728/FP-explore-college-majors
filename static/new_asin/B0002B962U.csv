8025559,3,B0002B962U,"If Telly Savalas' character were consistent he would have killed Mark Lester's character early on in the movie, however, then you would not have had a movie. It is neither Telly Savalas's nor Mark Lester's best work, but overall the movie is OK. Just don't expect too much, and enjoy it for what it is.",1382832000,,302,4.509090909090909
