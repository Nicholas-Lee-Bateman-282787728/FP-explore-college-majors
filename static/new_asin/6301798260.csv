369081,5,6301798260,"Castle in the Desert has unusually high production values ... for a Charlie Chan movie.  Camera angles, for example, are sophisticated, and sets are fairly elaborate, unlike some of the later Chans.  The plotting is fairly complex, and the acting is mostly of professional quality, even from the minor players.  All in all, this is one of my favorite in the Charlie Chan series.",1030752000,23,378,4.875

Charlie solves a murder which happens while he is a guest in a desert castle. Sidney Toler has the role of Charlie and Sen Yung plays Jimmy Chan.
John Larkin wrote the screenplay and the director was Harry Lachman. Mostly because of the plot, I have always considered CASTLE IN THE DESERT to be one of the better Chan movies.",1030406400,11,398,4.541666666666667
369083,4,6301798260,"CASTLE IN THE DESERT would be the last Charlie Chan film made by 20th Century Fox, which originated the series; the rights to the character was subsequently purchased by Monogram, where Chan films continued to be made--but to considerably less effect.  Consequently, CASTLE is generally regarded as the last film of any merit in the series.  It is also one of the most entertaining.  A neurotic historian and his wife, a descendent of the Borgia family no less, reside in eccentric isolation in a castle in the desert--where sinister doings are afoot, and Chan is summoned to take matters in hand.  The plot as it unfolds requires a certain suspension of disbelief re what is medically possible, but a particularly entertaining cast (Ethel Griffies is a standout) allows the viewer to buy into the tale, and the film abounds with comic florishes that Chan fans will enjoy.
Although the Charlie Chan films are sometimes accused of perpetuating racial stereotypes, they were in fact no more stereotypical than other serial-style films (Blondie and Dr. Kildare come to mind) of the era--and as the series progressed the patronization found in the earliest films was rapidly discarded.  Regretfully, many of the best Chan films are not available on video, much less DVD, and fans of the series who want to see such classics as CHARLIE CHAN AT TREASURE ISLAND or CHARLIE CHAN AT RENO(my own favorites) must hope for a showing on television.",1013299200,28,1435,4.9625

The story begins with a station wagon traveling in the Mojave Desert in California. We see a castle in the background. A black cat wanders by. Professor Gleason arrives to meet Mrs. Manderley ( descendant of Lucia Borgia). We see the other guests. Gleason falls after drinking a cocktail. ""That's impossible!"" Will the newspapers create a scandal? Doctor Redling says it was poison. Will they cover up this death? Charlie Chan receives an invitation to visit the castle from Mrs. Manderley. Can he use carrier pigeons to send messages? Chan arrives at a hotel (""Rooms 50 cents""). An astrologer warns Chan of danger. There is another passenger for the castle. Chan meets the other guests. Paul Manderley studies the 16th century, he lives without electricity or telephones (35 miles from town). Who lured Chan to this castle? Chan can't leave because the car was disabled (missing distributor cap). They are all isolated now. Madame Saturnia the astrologer accompanied Jimmy Chan to the castle.

Mr. Fletcher arrives at the castle, he is a private investigator looking into the death of Professor Gleason. Jimmy Chan watches Madame Saturnia in the dungeon. ""Too much of anything can kill."" What happened to Fletcher's body? Dr. Redling wants Mrs. Manderley sent to an institution. Suspicion falls on the guests. A dead pigeon! An arrow misses Chan, who investigates the crime. Madame Saturnia is in hiding. Mrs. Manderley learns her brother is alive! Chan discovers a motive for murder. Where is Paul Manderley? Jimmy disguises himself in a suit of armor. There is another disguise. There are events that provide clues to the crime. Chan unmasks Mr. Manderley. ""Who fired that arrow?"" Chan speaks, and a man gives himself away. Chan explains why Hartford was killed. At the end Chan finds that distributor cap so they can leave for town.

This low-budget movie is worth watching although the solution seems hurried. The players seem to be walking through their roles. This story seems to be adapted for a Charlie Chan movie, it is different from earlier movies. [That ""castle in the desert"" was only painted scenery.] The war and the OPA ordered Hollywood to keep costs down. One method was reduced lighting, creating dark films that were later called ""film noir"". [The listed 62 minutes for this movie suggests it had 13 minutes edited out from the usual 75 minutes for a `B' picture.]",1310601600,,2431,4.982758620689655

7815924,5,6301798260,"1942's ""Castle in the Desert"" is one of the very best of the Charlie Chan series.  Sidney Toler does the honors as the Honolulu Police Detective, assisted by Number Two Son, played for comic relief by Victor Sen Yung as a young soldier on pass from the Army.

Charlie is summoned by an unknown person to investigate an apparent murder at Manderley Castle, an austere Gothic replica built in the Mojave Desert by Paul Manderley.  Manderley, who wears a partial mask to hide facial scarring, is a reclusive scholarly millionaire and married to a descendant of the infamous Borgia family of Medieval Italian poisoners.  En route to the castle, Chan and Number Two Son fall in company with Madame Saturnalia, an astrologer prone to seemingly counterfactual predictions that nevertheless keep coming true.

At the isolated castle, done in chilling duplication of its medieval precessors and complete with suits of armor and a torture chamber, Charlie finds an exceptional collection of potential suspects.  It seems the killer or killers are still on the scene.  Members of the party, now cut off from the nearest town, keep dying.  Chan and Number Two Son must somehow keep one step ahead of the killer while trying to unravel a complex plot involving control over Manderley's millions.  The plot is likely to keep the viewer guessing to the very end.

""Castle in the Desert"" is a successful and suspenseful adaption of the classic closed house murder mystery.  There are more than enough sub-plots and red herrings to satisfy the amateur sleuths out there, while retaining the pithy proverbs and solid police work characteristic of a Chan drama.  This movie is very highly recommended to fans of the Charlie Chan series and of film noir.",1206748800,,1734,4.961937716262976
7815925,5,6301798260,"Not ONE of the other Charlie Chan films can touch this one. The casting is brilliant, the acting is superior, the cinematography is dramatic and, the location is PERFECT. Imagine that! A castle in the desert! This is a poisoning case, (sort of), and Charlie is summoned to help solve it. He's warned from going from the moment he's invited and, of course, one of his numerous sons (not quite so goofy as some others we've seen), tags along to watch out for his dear dad. Dark characters are everywhere and the sub-plots are above average. Fans of Charlie Chan films will drool over this one but the average viewer can enjoy this light mystery as well. The desert town, old vehicles, the landscapes, the castle, (and it's creepy accoutrements) are all about the coolest things you'll ever view in a black and white old-timey mystery film. Grab this one if you can find a copy!",1181520000,3,875,4.615384615384615
