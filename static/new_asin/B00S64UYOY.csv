6959322,5,B00S64UYOY,"This is a well-made DVD video series about the wonder of the universe and the God who holds all of it, the heavens--the entire created universe--in the palm of his hand. It contrasts the largeness of God with our smallness, yet shows how each of us is individually known and loved by God. It is a bit repetitious in his talks. Much of what he says deserves repeating anyway.

I just wound up giving away my copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Passion-Talk-Series-Essential-Collection/dp/B00GX00CI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Passion Talk Series: Essential Collection</a>, so I am replacing it with this more comprehensive complete collection. Now I'll be able to give away my single copies too.

Although by different authors, I thought this was a great sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Star-of-Bethlehem/dp/B002RBHDFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Star of Bethlehem</a>.

6959323,5,B00S64UYOY,"This collection is great. Louie Giglio's teaching is basic enough for the new believer to understand, refreshing to the more established Christian and relevant to the daily faith walk. Brings excitement, again, about the basic truths of knowing God.

6959342,5,B00S64UYOY,"Haven't watched the Christmas one yet, and probably won't watch the rest of the ones targeted to single Christians, but I loved every other one. My Bible study women's group went through these (going to do the Christmas one soon).  I love having my own copy of the set - I have gotten something else out of each talk when I watched again at home.  I LOVE how the first 3 set you up for all the rest by expounding on God and His universe.  These are eye-opening, thought-provoking (I don't necessarily theologically agree with every single thing, but I am a believer that God gave us the Holy Spirit and discernment so that we can follow Him while listening to a person here on Earth) and inspire me to worship!  Louie Giglio is a great speaker, too, very natural in the role of pastor speaker.",1449014400,4,793,4.410958904109589
