8337838,5,B001RE9HES,"This is my second video of Handel's Tamerlano and it will be the one I end up watching most of the time.

The costumes and sets are beautiful and the performances are all first rate.  I don't have any of the problems with this video that the other reviewers have.  I have a large collection of operas on DVD and Blu-ray and this is one of my favorites.",1486080000,,352,4.147058823529412

8337840,1,B001RE9HES,"I was incredibly excited to watch this when I ordered it. I mean, Domingo singing Handel on Blu-Ray? Sign me up! But then I received it in the mail, and, oh dear god...

To put it mildly, the English subtitles on this performance are an abomination to all organic and inorganic matter that has ever existed or will exist in any and all realms of the multiverse. It reads like something Yoda wrote while high on PCP, and instead of typing the subtitles into a keyboard, he threw darts at a dartboard where each space represents a letter, while blindfolded and hanging upside down from a swinging rope.

It's almost worth buying just to see it. The grammar. The word choices. The (lack of) punctuation. The ordering of the words. How in the hell was this approved for publishing? And more importantly, WHO WROTE THESE SUBTITLES?! At first I thought it was just a word-for-word English-to-Italian translation(which would still be deplorable), but upon cross-referencing the subtitles with the libretto(I have a decent enough understanding of Italian), it's not! They actually took liberties! I mean, someone actually read the libretto, scratched their noggin for a moment, and made a deliberate decision to write specific English words!

I tried. I really did. But I didn't even have a damn clue what was going on in the story because of the subtitles.

Allow me to illustrate what it's like. Imagine you're watching a production of Shakespeare's magnificent play, Hamlet. Recall this brief excerpt:

To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them?

Now pretend you don't speak English, this is your first time ever seeing it, and the same cretin who did these subtitles wrote the subtitles for our hypothetical Hamlet. Here's what you would see:

Better is not being or being either pain
More nobly it is
Well luck of the arrows
Or contrary to the troubled ocean arms take,
And them finished by the opposition?

How fun would that be to watch? And remember: Handel operas have lightning-fast recitatives. Some of these (unintelligible) lines fly by quickly! You would have to pause the video and figure out what it says before pressing play again(assuming you COULD figure out what it says)!

Save yourself some money and buy something else. Or donate to charity. Or just flush your money down the toilet, because that's what you would be doing by buying this garbage.",1434499200,,2517,4.821345707656612
8337841,3,B001RE9HES,"I'm also a Mingardo fan, and she doesn't disappoint in this production.  I have to disagree with the other two reviewers about Domingo and Bacelli, though, particularly the latter.  She uses far too much vibrato for a Baroque performance, and warbles her way through this production in a most irritating fashion.  The music and staging are great, but I don't think I'm going to be watching this disc very often, and will rather try and find a good version on CD.",1420934400,2,462,4.679012345679013
8337842,5,B001RE9HES,"I love Sara Mingardo so I buy anything that she does.  I was not expecting such a wonderful performance from Placido Domingo, however.  I was wrong in my estimation of his grasp of Baroque.  His performance was flawless and moving. My favorite was, of course, Sara Mingardo, who gives  a stellar performance in her role of Andronicus. You will be pleased by the many beautiful arias.",1391990400,3,383,4.757575757575758
8337843,5,B001RE9HES,"This is another opera where viewing the extra feature discussion with the conductor Paul McCreesh is very helpful preparation to better appreciate this very long opera so should be viewed first. He explains some fundamental differences between Baroque Opera and the later genre and this makes appreciation of this Handel work so much better.

Tamerlano is spread over 2 BD discs but is like Rameau's Zoroastre in that it is a work I'm attracted to come back to again and again. As with most Baroque operas it is a very long winded story caused basically by lengthy recitatives and arias with considerable repetition in its 3+ hours. But the Handel's music and its singing is so good in this production one can just relax and wallow in the emotion it generates so its length becomes an asset rather than a liability.

The voices of the female singers are not powerful but have a lovely timbre and are backed up by Placido Domingo who has never tackled baroque opera before but does so here brilliantly. The final duel with Monica Bacelli and Sara Mingardo is beautifully done and very touching. Their voices blend superbly and the recording generally is very well balanced..

And one should not ignore the musical contribution from the Orchestra of the Teatro Real (Madrid Symphony Orchestra) so ably and intelligently conducted by Paul McCreesh. Somehow he has managed to extract a very appropriate Baroque sound from these players using standard instruments.

The staging is relatively stark but very effective with the artists in appropriate costumes highlighted by clever lighting and stage effects.

But I'll level the same criticism at this presentation as I did with Zorostrate. It is not acceptable to omit a written synopsis of the plot and replace it with a few minutes of display among the extras. These plots are rather involved, not so much as to be incomprehensible, but complex enough to need written description, particularly for anyone like myself coming to this for the first time. So I hunted up a description on the net but that should not really be necessary.

Anyone who loves opera should be able to enjoy Baroque operas such as this, but it does help to understand that it is the recitative that guides the story rather than the aria as in Verdi etc works. Yes it does seem to carry on and on in some of these recitatives and arias but this is forgivable when the singing and the music is as good as it is here. It is a sound idea to follow Paul McCreech's suggestion of seeing an Act at a time and must admit I would find it difficult to appreciate it as much if I had to sit through the complete opera in the one session. But that is the beauty of being able to view it in the home at leisure.

This production is a gem and deserves to be on the shelf of all opera lovers. Unreservedly recommended.",1256169600,8,2823,4.656626506024097
