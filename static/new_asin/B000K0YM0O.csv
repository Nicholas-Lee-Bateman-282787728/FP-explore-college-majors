2680971,5,B000K0YM0O,"This movie speaks for itself. It's pure cinematic artistry from Akira Kurusawa himself. This movie is gorgeous. It's the best looking black & White film I have ever seen. The plot is very interesting & quite humorous despite the characters being faced with death at every turn. GREAT cinematography. When you observe what Kurusawa was able to do back in 60's without modern tech, it really puts most modern directors to shame. Toshiro Mifune is an extraordinarily well rounded actor, and this is my favorite roll of his that I've seen so far. Brilliant.",1317945600,5,553,4.8936170212765955

Alright, my third Kurosawa film! Here we have the continuing adventures of Sanjuurou in the self-titled movie, which amply reflects a good majority of the elements that made Youjimbou so successful. We're essentially presented with the same mix of comedy and drama (albeit, of a lighter nature), tantalizing swordplay (much bloodier), and a still very appealing protagonist, though not quite to the magnitude of its predecessor. However, what Sanjuurou lacks in overall bravado, it makes up for in some great character development and complexity. After listening to the very insightful commentary, I found that a lot of the elements in this movie helped to fill some of the character gaps and actually compliment Sanjuurou to make him a more complete person. Furthermore, the screenplay also differentiates itself from the previous film with the whole ""unsheathed sword"" analogy and its message on the brutality of violence, as opposed to its necessity in the former, and its focus on traditionalism, as opposed to Youjimbou's take on modernism. Instead of glorifying the bloodshed we were led to believe as a necessary, almost obligatory, catalyst for change in the first film, we learn here that even if killing is required, living with it is the hardest part of all. We're also exposed to the softer side of Sanjuurou here, as seen in his interactions with the rebel samurai. His brash and eccentric nature has always been a part of his charisma, though we get to see him display a little more compassion, maybe even a kind of paternal instinct for those young men. This complimentary piece to the tale of Sanjuurou is much more light-hearted, but at the same time adds a more intimate and subtle look to the man.

Video - 4.5

The video isn't quite as striking as it is for Youjimbou, but Sanjuurou still looks relatively good. Contrast, black levels, and overall sharpness show about the same level of excellence as its predecessor, though it does have a few moments of inconsistency. Images appear fuzzy, contrast or blacks are too high/low, and some shots even show instances of film damage, but only on occasion. Facial features and object detail still look amazing for a movie filmed in b&w, and I was particularly surprised at some of the shadow delineation in some of the night scenes.

Audio - 4.5

While the video transfer isn't as good, the audio is. The 3.0 DTS-HD track offers a clear and presentable effort with no loss of quality in the dialogue, music, or sound effects. Ambiance is as good as its predecessor with center and front side speakers engaging in their respective elements. Of special note, there are more instances of sword slash and flesh-cut noises as opposed to the wind effects and emphasis of the score in the previous film. The running water sounds also create a pretty pleasant atmosphere.

Extras - 4.0

More of the same as in Youjimbou: 35-minute behind-the-scenes featurette, a very in-depth commentary by Stephen Price, and a nifty little book with essays about Kurosawa and his work. I actually found the b-t-s feature a little less interesting than Youjimbou's. It tends to focus more on the writing/acting aspects and effects departments, but not so much on the filming process itself. Some of the cinematography was cool to look at, and it would've been nice to hear about the shooting locations as well. However, the commentary makes up for it a good deal, showing that Mr. Price, yet again, really knows his stuff.

Overall - 4.5

Sanjuurou is a great complimentary piece to Kurosawa's Youjimbou. It's not really a ""sequel"" in the structural sense, but more so a spiritual one. We get to see more of what makes him the man, as well as getting a few life lessons from his words and actions. While it's probably not quite as captivating as its first incarnation, this makes a fine addition to any Kurosawa or samurai fan's collection. Highly recommended.",1270166400,6,3913,4.907715582450832
2680973,4,B000K0YM0O,"He's a nameless, grizzled man who wanders through 1800s Japan. Think Clint Eastwood with a topknot.

And the sequel to Akira Kurosawa's classic ""Yojimbo"" is very different in tone -- rather than a straightforward grizzled-anti-hero-cleans-up-the-town tale, it's a comic story about the unnamed hero getting stuck on a ship of fools, and having to unravel a small-time political conspiracy. While it's Kurosawa's lightest samurai movie, it's still a solid action/drama flick with plenty of comedy sprinkled in.

A gang of idealistic young nobles are gathered in a decaying house, talking about how they are trying to battle local corruption. Suddenly a scruffy warrior (Toshir Mifune) who calls himself Sanjr Tsubaki (basic translation -- 30-year-old camellia... going on forty), appears and tells them who is lying and who isn't -- and that after confiding in the treacherous superintendant, they're being set up for an ambush.

After he saves their butts and drags the none-too-bright young men into hiding, he begins concocting a plan to save one young man's uncle, who is being held as a political hostage. After rescuing the lord's wife and daughter, Sanjuro and his band of fools continue with their plots to save him from the evil superintendant -- and he teaches his bumbling co-conspirators that exalted social position isn't what keeps you alive...

Kurosawa isn't known for having made goofball comedies -- he tended more towards action and tragedy --  but there's a definite comic flair to ""Sanjuro,"" from the pampered prisoner offering nuggets of wisdom (""Get back in the closet!"" one of his captors yells) to the silent ""happy dance"" that all the young noblemen do. At the same time, there's a poignant note to Sanjuro's regrets about the men he's killed -- including men much like himself.

Even steeped in comedy, Kurosawa's knack for action and vibrant creativity is still intact -- to give the feel that people are running, he shows short, rapid shots of several young men running down different streets. Every action scene is a pared-down, sharp-edged affair, and he juggles the complex plot threads easily. There are a few flaws (a lot of people get cut down without a speck of blood) but these are just minor quirks. And the finale is a shatteringly brutal scene, reminiscent of a western shoot-out, where you almost expect Sanjuro to put on a white cowboy hat and spit.

Mifune is wonderful as the grubby, grumpy samurai who is like an ""unsheathed blade,"" and who has more brains than his little gang. He gives the character a lazy, languid air, sort of like an unexploded land mine. His followers are well-acted, though they don't have much individual personality -- think the best buddies of Bertie Wooster, except with topknots and katanas. And small supporting roles -- like the kindly, prim noblewoman and the friendly prisoner in his little closet -- are very well-drawn.

As for the Criterion blu-ray edition, it has pretty much the same extras as the original DVD edition: improved subtitling, a behind-the-scenes stills gallery, theatrical trailer and teaser, an audio commentary track by a Kurosawa scholar named Stephen Prince, and a half-hour excerpt from ""Akira Kurosawa: It Is Wonderful to Create"" about ""Sanjuro.""

Lurking under the comic flourishes is an intelligent film with likable characters, solid writing, and plenty of action. ""Sanjuro"" is as good as the film before it, though in a slightly different way.",1261440000,10,3450,5.102836879432624
2680974,5,B000K0YM0O,"The usual high standard of tranfer and support materials from this superb publishing house.

2680975,5,B000K0YM0O,"An absolutely delightful film about samurai's fight for honor.  It is smart and funny.  We learn about a group of young samurai who want to stop corruption in their clan.  In preparation for their uprising they run into an outcast, seemingly unkept and not very polite samurai.  For exchange of food, saki and a little bit of money, he offers this group of rebels his warrior help.  While this group of young rebels has a fire in their belly to fight for the right cause, they are not particularly smart.  It is really funny when in one moment our main character says to one of them: ""Are you born in the year of Ox?"" trying to depict young man's not so bright standing.  We see japanese style sword fighing, but also battle of the wits.  Film will keep you entertained to the end with its humor and humility.  I absolutely recommend this film to anyone who enjoys foreign movies.",1195776000,2,880,4.484276729559748
2680976,5,B000K0YM0O,"""Sanjuro"" may not match its predecessor in sheer virtuosity, but it's actually more fun, thanks to Mifune's comic scenery-chewing, and the innately humorous contrast between the clean, proper youths and their unlikely, unkempt protector. Sanjuro's savvy counsel to the virtuous but impulsive youths (""Things are not always what they seem"") gets repeated and borne out through various developments which eventually help restore justice to the land. Bottom-line: In this entry, Mifune himself really warms to ""Sanjuro,"" and as a result, so do we.",1182988800,2,544,5.566265060240964

2680979,5,B000K0YM0O,"A group of eager, chivalrous, but young and inexperienced samurai find themselves marked for death by corrupt officials, but they are fortunate to make the acquaintance of Sanjuro (Toshiro Mifune), the masterless samurai whose sense of honor and decency is masked by a gruff, sarcastic exterior.  This film is played more for laughs than the previous ""Yojimbo,"" but director Akira Kurosawa doesn't stint on the swordplay and suspense.  Mifune is wonderful as always.  Despite the comedy, the film's stunning finale makes quite a sobering and penetrating comment on the character of a man like Sanjuro.",1171929600,,601,5.3052631578947365
2680980,5,B000K0YM0O,"Yojimbo (The Bodyguard) is a samurai movie based in the detective novels of Dashiell Hammett - particularly Red Harvest. Akira Kurosawa wanted to bring the best of literature and interpret it into Japanese cinema. Its interesting that the two main influences in this process were Hammett's hard-boiled detective fiction and William Shakespeare (Ran, Throne of Blood).  The sequel, Sanjuro, is a departure of sorts from Yojimbo. Kurosawa and Mifune return as we find our nameless hero assisting some naive samurai who have been backed into a corner by corrupt officials in their clan. Played more for laughs but still brimming with cynicism and wonderfully orchestrated fights (the final scene will leave you afraid to blink), Sanjuro is a worthy but unusual follow-up to the cynical Yojimbo.

Criterion did an excellent job with their recent re-release of Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, and it appears that they are giving the same treatment to both Yojimbo & Sanjuro. A new (and improved) translation, commentary from Steven Price, as well as documentary film focusing on Kurosawa during the time he was making these great movies.  This review is modified from my review of the Yojimbo/Sanjuro double DVD pack, each movie is great, but I'd recommend picking up both.",1170201600,,1266,5.196078431372549

Film = three (3) stars; restoration/preservation = five (5) stars; cinematography  = five (5) stars; choreography = barely three (3) stars; subtitles = barely three (3) stars; ""music"" = barely one (1) star.  Director Akira Kurosawa (who is also credited as a screen play co-writer) provides a comical and flowery (literally) addition to movie samurai myth and make believe in a sound-stage-entombed photo play about a wandering samurai (Ronin) with a sense of humor who turns up to provide adult sanity and guidance for local amateurs bent on going after their corrupt clan leaders but clueless as to how to proceed (and survive).  Kurosawa fills his film with lots and lots and lots of dialog (especially funny one liners) and humorous nonsense including having the rebels living (anonymously?) in a mansion right next door to the corrupt clan leader's estate with the properties connected by a stream used to secretly communicate (with spies in the leadership's household) by means of floating camellia blossoms--I kind you not!  Unrealistic, poorly- choreographed sword swinging (even the allusion of reality is left far behind!) briefly occurs here and there with the film suddenly ending in a firehose blast of blood from a samurai with EXTREMELY high blood pressure!  This is first and last (and everywhere in between) lead-actor Toshiro Mifune's film (to the point of embarrassment).  Kurosawa's reverential direction can be dispensed with along with the genuflecting cast.  (But not the satirical script writers, cinematographer or lighting department personnel!)  Cinematography (2.35 : 1, black and white) is always careful to photograph Mifune placed closest to the camera so as to make the actor look much bigger than all others in the frame (lighting is also employed to enhance this bigger-than-life effect).  There are some unique photo angles and cleaver tracking shots (made through phony studio bushes).  The wide-screen format is usually fully filled.  As for ""music,"" there isn't much beyond the use of sound effects especially that of a cracking whip.  When subtitles are visible (white lettering on white backgrounds makes for guessing here and there), they appear to be close enough to the dialog.  Enjoyable cartoonish movie.

8153703,3,B000K0YM0O,"Yojimbo is one of my favorite films.  It has a great character at the center, who wades into a faction-ridden city and plays them off of one another, at one point falling into their hands and barely escaping with his life in so much pain he has to crawl out.  He is alone, yet acts like a general, manipulating people in a very dangerous game.  By contrast, in Sanjuro, he acts more like a disinterested chess player, dispensing sage advice, sitting back to watch the fireworks, improvising quickly but never really in much danger, even his confinement is lackadaisical and without dramatic tension.  The character is consistent, but nothing much of interest - aside perhaps from the theme of ""keeping the sword sheathed"" - is added.  Even the milieu he chooses to fight in, a power grab of aristocratic factions is less fun than the warring town bosses in Yojimbo, particularly in view that those he chooses to champion in Sanjuro are pampered twits who keep throwing his plans off track if they do anything on their own initiative.  In Sanjuro, he never loses his cool, but maintains a strict control over everything, with little human seeming to peep out.

I hate to say it, but I don't think Kurosawa had anything much to say in this film.  I would recommend renting it, given the inflated price, and that only for aficionados, not the general viewer.",1395532800,,1355,4.711864406779661
