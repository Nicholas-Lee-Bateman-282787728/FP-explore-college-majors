2907595,4,B000TPTCSW,"I took my first dance lesson ten years ago and have taken classes off and on since then.

I found the pace here to be fine, although as other reviewers have mentioned, Alec and Edyta do not reverse their steps or dance with their backs to the camera for the most part. However, I was able to catch on much more quickly on a second viewing.

I wouldn't recommend this for an absolute beginner, but for an advanced beginner to an intermediate dancer, it's a great workout, fun, lively, and will make you look like a pro!",1212192000,4,518,4.329896907216495
2907596,4,B000TPTCSW,"I agree with the previous reviewers in that this video goes through the instruction process too quickly.  Each step begins with a slow explanation, which is good.  BUT, instead of slowly picking up the pace (slow counts, then medium counts), the instruction skips right to tempo (the speed of the music). I usually pick up moves faster than other people, because I did ballet and hip hop for many years.  But this instruction DVD went too fast, and didn't allow for enough practice time.  It's ok if you keep rewinding, and using slow motion, and then rewinding again, but it's kind of a hassle.  That being said, the content is very good, and I would rather mess with the rewinding and such in my living room, trying to perfect the basic components of each dance, instead of wasting $15 per class at a studio.  Thus, overall, I think it's a good product and would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn ballroom, but I hope the distributors will tweak the editing and make it an even better product.",1209513600,3,1001,4.595505617977528
2907597,2,B000TPTCSW,This was not good for a cardio workout. This is for instruction to dancing. You need a partner. I do love fitness with the pros. This is a lot better for a cardio workout.,1203465600,3,171,4.0588235294117645
2907598,4,B000TPTCSW,Best way to get fit and enjoy it...this dvd gives you a delightful way to do what it takes to get inshape and enjoy the view....,1203292800,,128,3.9615384615384617
2907599,3,B000TPTCSW,The DVD seems to be designed for people who have good experience and are serious about Latin dancing. Its fast pace might not be helpful for beginners.,1202860800,8,151,4.62962962962963
2907600,2,B000TPTCSW,"The package contains two discs, each containing instructions for two of the 4 dances covered.  There is very little initial tutorial for people, such as myself, who have never had any formal dance instruction.  The transition from the earliest basic instruction is much to rapid for a beginner to grasp.  The lessons would have been better if there was, for example, a ""birds eye view"" of how their feet were moving or they did the dance moves in even smaller pieces then joined them together.  I'd imagine there are more helpful instructional videos available.  If not, someone should rethink the way these videos are presented to the customers.  Don't let the names on the box think you're getting anything great.",1201392000,18,715,4.916666666666667
2907601,4,B000TPTCSW,"I consider myself an intermediate ballroom dancer, and I found this video well worth the price.  It may be a bit challenging for couples trying ballroom/latin dancing for the first time.  But I find it well worth the price for someone who has a few classes.  It's a great review, and the best thing is you can always play it back when you don't catch something.  Edyta and Alec have great technique and lines.  If anything, it's great inspiration!",1199059200,10,447,4.6075949367088604
2907602,5,B000TPTCSW,"This was by far one--if not the best workout DVDs I have ever used. I've tried all different kinds, but this one truly gave me an amazing workout that was fun, easy to follow and slowed down when I had trouble with a step. (thanks to the slow motion feature this DVD has!) Alec  and Edyta are very personable and it made it seem like you were working out with friends rather than with an instructor. It goes by quickly as well.....you barely realize you are working out! I recommend this to anyone who wants a fun workout!",1193443200,15,522,4.326530612244898
2907603,5,B000TPTCSW,"I bought Dancing Like the Pros DVD by Alec and Edyta from their website earlier this year, about two weeks after they performed on their tour in my home town in San Jose, California.  When I first watched the introduction of the DVD, I knew exactly this is what I had expected from it.
What I had was two DVDs, each one containing two styles of dancing.  Disc 1 teaches the Rumba and the Cha Cha, pretty basic dances.  Disc 2 teaches the Jive and the Samba, which are more difficult.  For each dance, the program is broken into three segments: beginners, intermediate, and advanced.  There are also two demos, one performed by Alec and Edyta, and another performed by their students.  Each segment has four or five routines that they go through one by one.  Toward they end, they put all of the routines together into a well choreographed dance.  For each routine, they teach you with intricate details the proper techniques to perform it slowly.  Then you will be required to perform it to the actual music.
Through out the entire course, you will come across the routines (each one having a distinct name) that you would now easily recognize when you watch Dancing with the Stars.  There will be basic steps, shuffle, twist, samba walk, whisk, cuban breaks, chasez, New York, spot turns, hand in hand, alemana, hockey stick, botafogo, cucaracha, and many more.
I really enjoyed watching Edyta dance gracefully with Alec.  You can practice these dances with a friend or a loved one, or you can also practice alone.  The beauty of this DVD set is that after having learned every routine of a dance in all three difficulty levels, you can put them all together and dance to an entire song or mix and match a few routines to your liking.
Enjoy :)",1191974400,91,1744,4.608414239482201
2907604,5,B000TPTCSW,"I'm a big fan of international latin dancing, I watch as many competitions and showcases as I can, and while I haven't gotten the chance to take any formal classes at a dance studio..... this is the next best thing!  Alec and Edyta as well as several of their students effectively demonstrate the basics, and some advanced moves as well, of the cha cha, rumba, jive, and samba.  Each dance has 3 levels on the dvd, a beginners level, intermediate, and advanced level.

With the dvd you'll miss out on learning some of the technical aspects that make latin dancing what it is, but if you don't have the time or money to take a regular dance class, check out this dvd.  You can learn the basics of latin dancing in the comfort of your own home and at your own pace.  I love this DVD!",1191801600,21,781,4.321917808219178
2907605,4,B000TPTCSW,"I bought this two weeks ago and have already lost 4 lbs. I really love it. The beginners session is slow and kills my muscles, while the intermediate session focuses more on dance moves rather than cardio. But I'm sweating through both sessions, so I guess it's working. This dvd, however, is not for absolute beginners - you should have some knowledge/understanding of weight shifting during dance.",1240185600,2,399,4.970149253731344
2907606,3,B000TPTCSW,"This instructional DVD is great for those with dance training, in ballroom or jazz dance,  but would be difficult for most without such training.

In order to enhance following along, it would be helpful if the instructors demonstrated step combinations with their backs to the camera. When a dance teacher faces the camera, students must reverse the movements which is confusing. This is what happens in this DVD and that's why it's so difficult to follow along.  In dance classes, usually the teacher's back is to the student so the student may follow along without reversing steps.  The men's and lady's footwork should be demonstrated separately allowing minimal practice. Then, they should demonstrate the combination of steps slow encouraging student couples to follow. The instructors can then speed the combination up gradually until the combination is being performed ""up tempo.""  The instructors should use correct dance terminology i.e step ball change instead of lock step and musically correct rhythm counts. Passing the latter by a trained musician, especially a percussionist, would be helpful.  The instructors on the DVD demonstrate the steps at a doable tempo and then turn on the music.  It's like starting out in 1st gear and shoving a transmission into 5th as the music is added.  They need to do a better job with instructor positioning,  male/ female step demonstration, with a bit more time devoted to student practice.

The dance combinations, choreography, stylized movement (i.e. rolling through the  ball and heel of the feet in the Samba; hip sway; arm/hand movements; body positioning; facial expression; gestures; and partnering) are awesome.  If you know how to emulate it, which usually takes training, its great.

The other dancers on the DVD would be useful to the ""whole choreographed dance"" demonstrations  but are not necessary to the individual combination demonstrations. In fact, they are a bit distracting.

I personally liked the choreographed approach to this training. But, in reality learning how to lead and follow should be included in the training. Otherwise, students will only be able to do routines with the person they practiced with.

I wish the instructors would make another version with greater attention to instructional design and andragogy.",1234396800,,2300,5.294765840220386
2907607,3,B000TPTCSW,"Was very nice but if you are just a social dancer, this is not for you.  Very nice to watch though.",1233878400,,99,3.7142857142857144
2907608,1,B000TPTCSW,"Well, the dancers are pretty to watch and I can pick up some pointers on some techniques, but as a teaching tool this is useless.  Just because someone can dance well does not make them good teachers and the instructional content of the DVD is terrible.  I recommend this DVD for those who like to watch dancers, not anyone wanting to learn or even improve their dancing.",1231804800,4,371,4.522388059701493
2907609,4,B000TPTCSW,I would not recommend this for beginners as it may intimidate you.  But it is a good video for advanced students.,1231804800,,113,4.380952380952381
2907610,5,B000TPTCSW,This video is most appropriate for people who already learned the basics and want to advance to the next level up.  It teaches great style as the instructors do beautifully.,1226102400,,173,4.766666666666667
2907611,5,B000TPTCSW,"You don't need to be a fan of ""Dancing with the Stars"" to enjoy this DVD. Pop it in anytime you want to just have a little fun, learn a new dance step, practice an old favorite, or just get energized for an evening out. It's easy to follow, and if you can keep up with the routines, you'll also get a fantastic workout. The hosts are both attractive and enjoyable, too! All in all one of my favorite ""exercise"" DVDs.",1224460800,,416,4.148148148148148
2907612,2,B000TPTCSW,"Great production, but this video fails as a teaching video, unless you learn strictly by watching and picking up moves as they happen real time.  It goes from watch to warp speed in what seems like just seconds without much detail or practice time. Going through the video is frustrating as a student and not recommended.  If you want to get the video to look at several good looking people dancing for entertainment purposes, that's up to you. I'd much rather just watch Dancing With The Stars.",1221091200,5,495,4.67816091954023
2907613,4,B000TPTCSW,"This is a great, inspirational video, but I knocked it down a star for false marketing.  This is an ADVANCED video, not for beginners.

If you are just starting out, start with a basic DVD like Kasia Kozak's ""Anyone Can Dance Absolute Beginners"" series, or Teresa Mason's ""Do You Want To Dance"" Beginner Level series.",1220486400,,317,4.745454545454545
2907614,5,B000TPTCSW,This is a great video.  It teaches couples dancing so you can learn little routines with your partner.  This isn't as much for exercise as their fitness DVD but focuses on the dance steps.  They start out slow and speed up.  They demonstrate and explain everything very well.  Just make sure you know they always use the man's steps so don't focus too much on that until Edyta gets to the woman's steps.  Really great.,1214697600,,418,4.506666666666667
8210273,5,B000TPTCSW,"If you really want to dance Latin and Jive as it is supposed to be danced, buy this DVD.  If you find it difficult to follow, take group and private lessons first and then come back to the DVD.  You will then find that this DVD is a precious resource and much less expensive than just one private lesson. Edyta and Alec are superb dancers.",1508889600,,339,4.2

8210276,2,B000TPTCSW,"I loved ""Fitness with the Pros"" and have been looking for this DVD since. I finally got it, and to my complete disappointment it turns out to be a dance instruction DVD for which you actually need a partner. I totally thought this was an advanced version of the Fitness DVD with other dances and routines. I was crushed :(",1357084800,,322,4.383333333333334
8210277,5,B000TPTCSW,"Great dvd...for all levels. Great dance moves...Edyta and Alec make it fun and exciting. They are young and energetic and make you want to dance.
Some moves you may have to rewind and watch over and over...but eventually you get the hang of each move. Well done...hope they bring out more!",1310947200,,289,4.686274509803922
8210278,4,B000TPTCSW,I am currently taking ballroom dance lessons and bought this CD to supplement my learning. Private lessons are very expensive and last only 40 minutes so any extra help I can receive from a professional whenever I want is a great savings!! This CD is not for beginners because many of the steps are more advanced. I do use it to learn styling techniques. My intentions are to actually learn some of the routines they teach!!,1296518400,,424,4.592105263157895
8210279,1,B000TPTCSW,"I am surprised that this video has received so many positive reviews. I agree with those who say that this is not a good video in terms of its instructional value. I've taken a few ballroom dancing lessons, so I'm not a complete novice (close to it, but still...). However, I was extremely frustrated with this video--and I'm still on the ""beginner"" level segment of the cha-cha! If you have already taken extensive dancing lessons, you most likely will be able to keep up, but for the average person, this video is NOT helpful. The pros initially slow the steps so much that you have no sense of the rhythm, and then they immediately dance it to music which is so fast that it's impossible to make the adjustment to the faster tempo. Also, they don't show the steps from the perspective of the learner (that is, they face the camera, so they are going the opposite direction that you are), so that aspect too is a problem. If you are thinking of buying this video, I recommend getting it from the public library first (if possible) to see if it works for you. If you don't have that option, I would recommend NOT buying this one.",1276300800,5,1130,4.463768115942029
8210280,5,B000TPTCSW,"This is one of the best dance instruction videos I've ever seen. Production quality is top notch, and the instructors and pro level. For the people complaining about the dvd being too difficult. There is a button on the remote called ""pause."" Try using it, and you may have a different impression of this video! The dances are broken into 3 levels, beginner, intermediate, and advanced. I'm a new dancer and I found beginner and intermediate easy to follow, again, if you have trouble keeping up with the pace, use the pause button! Dancing like other things is about repetition and practice, even if you hire the best instructors, you're not going to become an overnight pro. Again, great dvd, lots of content, covers 4 of 8 international dances, I hope they make another one for the other 4, I'll be the first to buy!",1273536000,,819,4.655172413793103
8210281,3,B000TPTCSW,"This is the instuction dvd to the practice of the Fitness with the Pros dvd. Why split them up? Who knows.
It's the same huge set with Edyta Sliwinska & Alec Mazo & about 8 couples behind who already can dance very well with good form.
They split the dances to beginner, intermediate, advanced for each that run consecutively & each difficulty is about 10 min each. This time they teach in 1/4 (very slow), overly exaggerating the steps a couple of times w/somewhat decent instruction, then FULL tempo which is quite jarring. The camera likes to focus on upper bodies, move around a lot to look interesting, but it's frustrating when you want it to stay so you can FOLLOW ALONG. I used REW & SLOW so much, it wasn't funny, even with all the past dance workouts I've done that many I didn't have a problem following.
I do best with 1/2 time for a long time WHILE giving instruction & later full tempo as many dances are truly fast & very few dancers can keep proper form going so fast so soon. Again, with all the couples behind them, same stage, they never turn their back to you, the camera likes to look cool by showing the upper body so you can't even focus on the feet.
The moves they teach are great, all are great dancers, but only those who learn dance easily will not be frustrated. Some of the beginner steps that aren't complicated are easy to learn, but many others....

8210282,4,B000TPTCSW,The product is great. I wish it incorperated some individual steps rather than focusing only on partner work. It was also a little hard to follow at times because they instruct facing towards you. Overall the combinations are fun to do and can be difficult at times but if it were easy it wouldnt look as good.,1244419200,,310,4.456140350877193
