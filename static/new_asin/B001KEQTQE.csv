8314867,4,B001KEQTQE,I teach in a pull-out 4th - 6th grade Special ed classroom with LD students.  I bought the DVDs to share with my students because I want them to have some exposure to science since we don't have much time for direct instruction in Science.  We watch one segment at a time and then have some oral discussion of the segment.  My students really enjoy the humor and the information and ask lots of questions after the segment.  I knew the DVDs were good quality because the classroom teachers in my previous school district had used them as part of their Science curriculum when I was doing Science inclusion in the general education classrooms.,1266624000,,642,4.605263157894737
