8098813,5,B000CFGD4U,"Sabah is a movie about a Muslim family in conflict. I was initially doubtful about whether I would like this movie. It is about a traditional family struggling to survive and adjust to the death of the father. The father left some money and assigned the son the job of running the family. He misspends the money and covers it up, while struggling to support his family. Mean while his wife is bored with him and wants a divorce. two of his sisters are secretly involved with men, in violation of their Muslims values. Sabah, the forty year old sisters is involved with non-Muslim Canadian man, with whom she is uneasy about continuing their relationship. they meet when she goes to a pool to swim and she takes his towel by mistake. one night she sleeps over at his apartment..When she returns the next day, her family wants to know what happened and she tells them, and they pretend to be shocked. Then they accept the fact that this is a new age where values are different. This movie ends with the women dancing.
  This  movie is  a good role model for Muslims caught in their traditional value system and struggling to adjust to today's world where things are different. I have more respect for Muslims after seeing this  movie.",1437436800,,1232,4.581818181818182

8098815,5,B000CFGD4U,"Director Ruba Nadda brings new life to the classic drama of family, culture, and forbidden love in a witty drama that blends Syrian tradition with modern Canadian values. With a potent performance, Arsine Khanjian distills the myriad social complexities facing immigrant Arab women. As her fortieth birthday approaches, Sabah faces a crossroads. As her family's principle caregiver, she finds herself without a mate, without freedom, and without options - until a chance meeting and a soggy towel bring her within a breath of romance. The problem: the object of her desire is a Canadian carpenter bereft of religious belief.

The unlikely courtship initially avoids the watchful eyes of a suspicious mother, unsupportive sister, outlandish niece (rising star Faddia Nadda), and domineering brother Majed (convincingly played by Jeff Seymour). Overcoming awkward beginnings, Sabah and her clandestine suitor build a shared understanding of their cultures - and draw inexorably closer to an unavoidable moment of truth. A confrontation threatens to shatter the entire family, and a dangerous showdown between brother and sister reveals a staggering secret. Sabah is not the only one who is not what she seems...Does any resolution exist? Perhaps, if a family trapped in its past can find a way to move forward together. ""Sometimes,"" Sabah declares, ""you have to bend the rules.""",1132876800,6,1376,5.429906542056075
