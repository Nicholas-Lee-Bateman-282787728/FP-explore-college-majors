2118299,5,B0002T2ZGQ,"this film is always maligned and sneered at. considering the junk that most people tolerate, i'd hardly say it's justified in the case of this often quite beautiful film. i'm not going to say it doesn't come without it flaws, hammy acting, syrupy sentiments, at times overblown Russian set design and a overall penchant for over-the-top and unintentional silliness, but in the long, it all works out with a sweet feeling of serenity and sincerity and a strong intention of goodwill to all.
  it's also not a bad adaptation of 'The Bluebird' folklore and of the Dutch play. i've seen other versions of 'Bluebird' and researched the material a little and have found that this version seems to be aware of the many interpretations. especially the beautiful Tourner Silent film classic from 1918. in fact this was more like the silent film version than anything else.
  Elizabeth Taylor might have been a hot mess as a person, but she was one of the greatest Shakespearian actress of cinema. and in the 'Bluebird' she is all diamond and crystal. she is all sweetness, purity, and light. quite a feat for Taylor. ""sweetness"" was something Taylor hadn't done since 'National Velvet' and 'Father of the Bride'. she really wins you over with niceness in this movie that you can scarcely believe she was such a shrew in real life. anyone that knows Taylor's off screen personality knows she was a mixed up broad who was more like Martha in Edward Albee's play than any kind of Glinda the good fairy. but i will give her credit for pulling this off. but it does give viewers that really know her a little eerie ""dr Jeykll and Hyde"" feeling.
  Jane Fonda was very good and very funny, but i will have to say Cicely Tyson's performance disturbed me a little. Tyson's hyper ventillating kitty cat is even more unnerving when you consider Tyson's legendary crack and drug abuse problem at the time this movie was made. you watch Tyson's meow kitty and you really have to wonder, ""omg. what was she high on?"". but it is a amusingly nutty performance that's for sure.
  this is a delightful film for all ages. and very wholesome unless you count Ava Gardner's portrayal of sexual lusting. but the message is timeless and healthy, something that i can't always say about most fairytales or folklore. and it is more psychologically correct than the persistance of a Disney idealization of happiness.
  it is told that many go searching for the bird that is blue, but very few actually find it.",1330128000,3,2475,4.721577726218097
2118300,4,B0002T2ZGQ,"The first coproduction between Rusia and Usa couldn't be more succesful. The Leningrad Kirov ballet Company,  The Leningrad Choreographical Miniatures, and the unusual presence of legendary actresses such as Elzabeth Taylor, Jane Fonda and Ava Gardner two lovable children (sons of a humble woodcutter) and Miss Light, Miss Sugar, Miss Water, Mr. Bread, Mr. Fire, Mr. Dog and Miss Cat will aid them to find the Blue Bird in order to make happy a sick girl.

A familiar entertainment that follows the steps of Wizard of Oz but that doesn't mean anything.

Watch it. You'll love it!",1315785600,4,580,4.958762886597938
2118301,5,B0002T2ZGQ,"This is the 3rd film version of this story, and my favourite. I watched it because i LOVE Elizabeth Taylor in just about anything. After watching it online i was desperate to find it on dvd, and i was happy i did. When i received it i immediately watched it again.
The story is so sweet, the child actors are adorable, especially the little boy he is so heart warming! Ava Gardner and Jane Fonda has 1 scene each, they both fit in the movie and great!
Elizabeth Taylor is definitely carrying the movie, playing 4 roles in it!!! First we see her as the mother which she plays with such heart, she really is the mother natural and heart warming! Then the witch, in which she is unrecognizable, she is having such fun with it! Then the light! She looks really beautiful, in parts ( like when the children return from the grandparents and Elizabeth is singing in the field ) she is simply mesmerizing!!! She has such screen presence that not many people have nowadays! Then her last role which is really short is Maternal Love in which she is still wonderful but she looks a bit tired there. But thats just an interlude before she comes back as light and then the mother again in the end of the movie!
She has made such great movies ( and some bad ones, but she even shines in those ) she is truly an actress who just radiates on screen!
The movie itself is such a sweet, heartwarming story with the performances and its so beautifully filmed,  i do not understand how could it be a failure when it came out.
The dvd is okay, its a russian product, but you can watch it in original english. The picture quality is average, a bit grainy in parts, but acceptable. I wish they would release a crisp, sharp version of it, the movie itself so beautifully filmed a great wide relase might make this a successful one.
It is truly recommended to see!",1266796800,10,1838,4.358600583090379
2118302,5,B0002T2ZGQ,"First time I saw that movie I was 6 years old, so it was great so see it again,25 years later, because it was one of my favorite movies. I even named my cat Tylette back then. I wish they would reproduce this movie today, with all the special effects in movies, it would be great, because the story is fantastic and very magical!",1256688000,,329,4.15625
2118303,5,B0002T2ZGQ,If you saw this when you were a kid and want to share it with your kids then its a great buy. My 9 year old found it really interesting and I loved watching it since I haven't seen it since I was a child. There is a lot of dancing and ballet if you are into that kind of thing.,1229472000,,277,3.557377049180328
2118304,3,B0002T2ZGQ,"In the 1970's, my children watched this production over and over again on cable-TV. And surprise-surprise, it has Elizabeth Taylor in it! Kind of a laborious tale, but interesting in parts. I thought I would never see it again. Now my grandchildren can watch it and I'm anticipating their reviews.",1216425600,2,297,4.96
2118305,5,B0002T2ZGQ,"I had the apportunity of sharing this film with a group of children of various ages from 5 to 14 years old.  This film captures the innosence lost or trap in us as we get more involved in society and tend to look up to others espectations and forget who we are and who we can be.  Great film.

Sincerely,
A Friend",1200700800,5,313,4.016129032258065
2118306,3,B0002T2ZGQ,"This film was not a hit when it was released and after viewing it, it is easy to understand why.  The film is more of a curiousity.  Its curious to see top film stars Elizabeth Taylor, Ava Gardner, Jane Fonda in a lackluster film like this and one is left wondering why.  Save your money and buy the Shirley Temple version on VHS instead.  Unlike the Shirley Temple version, the motivation for the children to seek the Bluebird isn't there.  They don't seem particularly unhappy with their present life, so why look for the Bluebird.  The costumes, particularly Tylo the dog's, look cheap and the film lacks the overall lush production values of the earlier Shirley Temple version.  There is no emotional depth to the direction. This is particularly evident when you compare how the separation of the young lovers in the Land of the Future was handled in each version.  Tylo, the dog and Tylette, the cat are weak counterparts to their earlier predecessors. The additional characters of Bread, Water, Fire, Milk & Sugar are fairly disposable, as they lend nothing to the story.  Cicely Tyson's Tylette lacks the true sinisterness of the same character portrayed by Gale Sondergaard in the earlier version.  Elizabeth Taylor seems totally out of place as the children's mother and as Light. Ava Gardner in the Land of Luxury appears to be reprising her role in the British ""horror"" film Tam Lin, i.e. peculiar parallels in that in both films her character spirits away young men, while ignoring and even resenting the female character attached to the men.  As I said before, the film is peculiar.  Its hard to comprehend why it was made and what attracted these stars to it.",1161216000,5,1673,4.790940766550523
2118307,4,B0002T2ZGQ,"This is one of the memorable movies in my life. I watched it as a kid and loved it.

So thrilled that it's on DVD now. I want my child to see it now and hopefully enjoy as much as I did when I was a kid.

2118308,5,B0002T2ZGQ,"Hey Folks,

This is one of the best family movies I have ever seen! It was 20 years ago, in the ""old"" country, and I am not Russian - so there is no patriotism here.

The story is fantasic, the cast is at their best, and the Russian cinematogrpahy in adapting fairy tales has a long and excellent tradition.

This is a movie about values in life, about searching for happiness and the meaning of life, and I am extatic it is now available on DVD.",1101254400,31,446,4.162790697674419

I haven't seen this since I was a single digit, and there may be some cheesy moments; but this movie is incredible in teaching kids even the hard lessons of life which parents shy away from.

8031510,3,B0002T2ZGQ,"Beautiful color movie.  But the segment with Jane Fonda was dark, and didn't fit in with the rest of the movie.  Otherwise, the acting was fine.",1362096000,2,144,4.5
8031511,5,B0002T2ZGQ,"1976's ""The Bluebird"" was directed by George Cukor and starred Elizabeth Taylor in multiple roles, Cicely Tyson, Jane Fonda, Ava Gardner, Robert Morley and two cute, talented kids.  That alone should make it worthwhile, but nearly doesn't as Tyson's character isn't written well, and Fonda seems is too aware this is for children and is less chilling than she could be.  The others are excellent.  Even as a musical this is somewhat of a grand curiosity as some of the songs should very well be heard from this often maligned American-Russian production of Maeterlinck's Nobel prize winning classic.  The music as well as most positions on the cast and crew are an equal balance of American and Russian.  Music is by Irwin Kostal and Andrei Petrov.  As it was not until 1990 that Communism was abolished in Russia, this co-production has a lot of unresolved production problems.  Even the DVD edition here by Ruscico is a Russian version including the processing of the titles and credits.  But at least the Russians are proud enough of the at times brilliantly conceived film to make it available.",1335052800,4,1098,4.897297297297297
