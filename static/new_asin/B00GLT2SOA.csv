6084942,5,B00GLT2SOA,"When NBC canceled ""Mama's Family"" after two seasons, I wondered why because it was a hit with audiences. Sure it was not high brow comedy but it was entertaining.

Vicki Lawrence wrote in her autobiography about the cancelation. Two years later, the show found a new home in syndication where it was highly rated. In the duration, Betty White and Rue McClanahan went on to do the popular sitcom, ""The Golden Girls.""

In the first episode in syndication, Rue's Aunt Fran met her untimely death and we have her funeral. Also is the arrival of Ed and Eunice's reform school son, Bubba, to live with them. Ed and Eunice live in Florida.

This season also introduced family friend, old maid spinster and caretaker to her parents, Iola Boyland played wonderfully by Beverly Archer. Vint's kids, Buzz and Sonia, are gone without explanation.

Still the show must go on and I was thrilled to see Mama's Family return somewhere and thrive in syndication. Executive Producer Joe Hamilton won the show in his divorce from Carol Burnett who played Eunice.",1391472000,18,1043,4.842696629213483
6084943,5,B00GLT2SOA,"Sure, the first two seasons introduced us to what what was going to be an even bigger show in syndication, but the difference is evident after the format switched (and the grandkids left).  At some point a show can have TOO MUCH starpower, and that's exactly what happened in the first two seasons.  Carol Burnett was already a comedian, as was Betty White, and even Rue McLanahan to a certain extent.  When all these characters left, it was up to the writers and producers to come up with clever sub-plots and they certainly pulled it off!  Turning Vinton into a dimwitted husband, instead of the leader, was a great way to set up storylines for his relationship with Naomi.  Iola, was a very interesting neighbor, and she added her own personality to the Harper household.  Bubba was also a needed addition, because contrary to the boring and monotonous grandkids, he was a more realistic teenager.  This show definitely took off in season 3, and continued to it's final episode (in in 1990).  They may not be the ""full"" episodes, but unless you have the homemade VHS tapes of the original broadcasts, it's probably as close as you'll get!",1391385600,12,1141,4.7272727272727275
6084944,5,B00GLT2SOA,"Special Features:

-Family History: A Classic ""Family"" sketch from The Carol Burnett Show, featuring Maggie Smith.
-Featurette: Mama's Family Tree: The Sprouts
-Mama Knows Best: A Mama's Family Cast Reunion
-Interview: Allan Kayser

Mama, Naomi and Vint return in the first-run syndication of Mama's Family Season 3 which introduces Mama's delinquent grandson Bubba (Allan Kayser) adjusting to his new home life and prissy next door neighbor Iola (Beverly Archer) who displays her obvious crush on Vint. Betty White (who had already moved on to The Golden Girls with fellow Mama's Family alum Rue McClanahan) guest stars in one last episode, Best Medicine.

Vint and Naomi are far less aggressive beginning this season and more dimwitted. It is Mama who has the brains in the family and keeps her brood on their toes. This season also marks when the show became more silly/light hearted and less serious than the previous two seasons and the overall look of the show improved. The syndicated years are generally more popular with the fans.

Regular guest stars include Dorothy Van (Aunt Effie), Earl Boen (Reverend Meechum) and Anne Haney (Alberta Meechum). Other guest stars this season include Yeardley Smith (voice of Lisa Simpson), Lewis Arquette, Brent Spiner, Dr. Joyce Brothers and Kathleen Freeman.

6084985,5,B00GLT2SOA,"I just bought this season 3 favorite from Amazon recently. This show is one of the best and funniest TV spin off's. From the Carol Burnett show of course! I have never been a fan of laugh-a-minute comedy, especially when it's not funny but the writing and acting for this show is so well done the funny is actually funny and non stop. I'm a believer!

From a writers perspective what makes this show very workable has to do with well seasoned characters as portrayed by the actors themselves. Just imagining them as they interact makes it very easy as a writer to come up with good material. Speaking of which...

Synopsis: Bubba is dateless and spends his Saturday night playing bingo with the family. When the girl next
door comes over asking for a cup of sugar, Mama try's to set Bubba up with her.

Bubba comes down the stairs. Mama, Vinton, Lola and Naomi are sitting at the table playing bingo.

Bubba: Mind if I join in?

Vinton: Not at all son. Take a seat!

Bubba: Gee, thanks!

Bubba takes a seat and is handed a bingo card to play.

Mama (to Bubba): And just what are you all excited about? Shouldn't you be out having
a good time with your friends?

Vinton: Now come on Mama! Maybe Bubba just wants to have a good time here
with family for a change!

Mama: For a change? If we wanted change around here Vinton all we would have to do
is go out and just find some new friends and places of our own instead of sitting here
antagonizing each other!

  It is so much fun watching this series again!! I was one, of many who bought the Complete Series when it was released back in 2013. If you don't have all of the seasons already, I would recommend getting the Complete Series boxset for the Bonus Features on the bonus discs!

Betty White makes an appearance and then her character isn't around that much any more either. This is the time period they start Golden Girls I believe. The 2 kids who were Vinton's (Ken Berry) kids disappear and briefly mentioned in the opening 1st episode that they can't make it to Fran's funeral, and they mysteriously are gone. In comes the actor to play Bubba who is the son of Eunice and Ed who have disappeared or seems like hiding from their child who is getting out of reform school. So he moves into Mama's house and she gives him Fran's old room since she has died. Now where the writer's didn't explain...Vinton and Naomi are supposed to move into Fran's old room, but Bubba is given that room by Mama. So my question is: Wasn't there 2 other rooms vacated by the 2 kids who mysteriously disappeared? (LOL) I guess they keep milking the idea that Vinton and Naomi must stay in the basement!  Then enters the next door neighbor who is obviously in love with Vinton as childhood friends, but only appears in Season 3. Oh well, guess there has to be cast changes in Television.

I do remember this cast ensemble the best and the writing of episodes seemed to get better. I mean that Rue McClanahan and Betty White were great in their episodes, but the Mama's family ensemble seem to jell efficiently with the new cast. The next door neighbor who's always in your house, and the grandson who acts much better than the 2 kids did in two seasons! <g> No matter what-- Mama's Family Season 3 is a hoot!

I'm editing this review after viewing Season 3 and watching the special features. That's one thing I like about any old TV series that has interviews of the cast who sit down and maybe tell you a back story. What I didn't know was that Mama's Family was cancelled after the 2nd Season. Vicki Lawrence explains that the head executives didn't exactly understand the rural humor of Mama's Family, and during the reunion segment kept asking everyone ""didn't they remember the show always being put in horrible time slots up against outstanding TV shows!?"" I can relate to that seeing other or favorite TV shows that I always liked get the boot so to speak, and wonder why when they had a miserable time slot? You would have to watch the special features I can't remember which broadcasting stations did what, but eventually they got Mama's Family back on the air and of course, Rue McClanahan and Betty White were on ""Golden Girls"" by then (2-year lapse) and thus some new editions to the cast. The new character of a new neighbor ""Iola"" and the new character as I described previously of ""Bubba."" Vicki even stated she felt sorry for the actors who played the 2 kids on her previous 2 seasons, and they were never given a chance during the show. I'm pretty sure she meant that half the time they didn't even have speaking parts in a lot of the episodes, or you never got to really understand their characters. Remember the first season they were still trying to flesh out the Mama character besides any of the other main characters of the show. I'm not sure how the writing went down, but I think they had trouble writing and creating all the characters in the first few seasons--no matter what they tried. Even the character Naomi was changed around. Actor Allan Kaysar explains his auditions for Bubba. Dorothy Lyman explains her commute from New York to California when she was called personally by Carol Burnett to come join the Mama's Family ensemble while she was still under contract with her soap opera.",1419897600,2,3687,4.574886535552194

6085263,5,B00GLT2SOA,"Mama's Family Season Three is hilarious and highly engaging. In a nod to continuity, Rue McClanahan's character of Aunt Fran is put to rest in the opening episode, which also brings a new character into the family--Bubba Higgins, offspring of Carol Burnett's Eunice character and Harvey Korman's Ed. Bubba is a somewhat reformed juvenile delinquent with a juvenile hall record. A very special relationship develops between Bubba and his Grandma--Thelma Harper, still played to perfection by Vicki Lawrence. Even though Bubba has his problems with Grandma, they both manage to work it out--unlike with Eunice.  Maybe Mama sees in Bubba a chance to establish a firmer foundation than she had with either of her daughters. Speaking of the other daughter, Betty White reprises her role as Ellen one last time. While it's sad to see the departure of comedy greats White, McClanahan, and Burnett from this season (Rue and Carol do not appear at all), the series manages to continue delivering laughs with Mama's son Vint (Ken Berry), daughter-in-law Naomi (Dorothy Lyman), and another new-to-this-season character, Mama's neighbor Iola (Beverly Archer), in addition to the aforementioned Bubba, who is played by Allan Kayser. Highlights include Ellen's series swan song ""Best Medicine,"" and also some of my favorites, ""The Love Letter,"" ""Steal One, Pearl Two"", and ""Buck Private Bubba."" There is a hilarious Thanksgiving episode and a less funny but still enjoyable Christmas episode. The character of Mama softens as this season progresses, but that is necessary for the longevity of any series--crotchetiness only goes so far before audiences want to see more genuine humanity. Mama's transformation is painful yet plausible, as she progresses through many stages of reconcilation with her family members and tries her best to be understanding, often with very humorous results. Vicki Lawrence and the writers did not tone down the character all at once--they did it believably by degrees.

One plot point is never cleared up--in Seasons One and Two, Vint's daughter Sonia occupied the spare bedroom upstairs, while his son Buzz slept in the attic. Aunt Fran was livid about losing her planned office space by having to give over the room to Sonia. So now in Season Three, when Aunt Fran is deceased and Sonia and Buzz have gone away to school, there should be TWO extra bedrooms upstairs (plus the attic room)--plenty of room for Bubba to have a room of his own, and Vint and Naomi to move upstairs and out of the basement as well.  Yet in Episode One of this season, Naomi is at first upset when Bubba gets Aunt Fran's old room because it means that she and Vint have to continue to live in the basement. But what happened to Sonia's old room?

There are many extras on this DVD set, including a Carol Burnett sketch that focuses on Eunice and Ed's son Bubba when he was in school, even though Bubba is not seen in the sketch. Maggie Smith is first-rate as Bubba's long-suffering teacher. There is also an interview with Allan Kayser regarding his role in the series. Interestingly, he reveals that in preparation for the part he studied Carol's performances as Eunice so that he could do a convincing job of playing her son. (Too bad they never got to appear together in an episode.)

Long-time fans of the Mama character may feel a little let down, as this season is less acrimonious than Seasons One and Two, and there seem to be fewer guest stars this time around. It's a tamer version of Mama's Family than before, but it makes up for this with greater depth of character and still a healthy portion of belly laughs.",1396051200,9,3619,4.9068627450980395

6085280,4,B00GLT2SOA,"Love Mama's Family, favorite sitcom of the 80s, but have questions before deciding what to buy............someone mentioned that season 3 (the start of syndicated episodes) are not the ""full"" episodes, as opposed to what one would have recorded from TV when they first aired.

My question is: are the episodes on this individual set different from those in season 3 on the $199 complete series box set? Are there actually uncut or full versions of syndicated episodes?

Aside from season 1 and 2 that I know are edited in TV rereuns (I know I need the DVDs to get them uncut), all of my Mama's Family episodes were recorded from TV in 1989-90 in reruns, with season 6 being recorded new. Would my seasons 3-5 be the same as those on these DVD (and maybe the full box set)? And would my recordings of season 6 be uncut whereas the DVD versions are likely to be edited?

6085300,5,B00GLT2SOA,"We all know the multiple incarnations this series and its characters went through: from the Family sketch of The Carol Burnett Show, to the TV special Eunice, to Mama's Family on NBC and finally first-run syndication Mama's Family.

Although there were some great episodes in seasons 1 and 2, seasons 3 to 6 really made Mama's Family the great rural sitcom it was supposed to be. They fleshed out Raytown and its residents to fit with the Harpers, making it the southern town where it was supposed to take place! Bringing in Bubba and Iola made the series richer and much more truthful - much more realistic than Buzz and Sonja of the previous seasons. Even the set was brighter and warmer!

The amazing extras on this set are all about Bubba! It starts with a classic Family sketch from The Carol Burnett Show featuring Maggie Smith as Bubba's teacher discussing his behaviour. Then there's the Mama's Family Tree: The Sprouts (all about Bubba) montage and interview clips, and finally an interview with Allan Kayser. The one extra not ""all about Bubba"" is the 25 minute cast reunion: superb! My one ""complaint"" is that the cast reunion and the Allan Kayser interview end rather abruptly with no ""outro"" or concluding thoughts. But other than that, the extras are superb and great fun! I hope the season 4 extras will be all about Iola!",1394668800,3,1337,4.733905579399142

6085303,5,B00GLT2SOA,"After two years of being cancelled Lorimar-Telepictures consider picking up Mama's Family for an additional 100 episodes.
Unlike the first 35 these additional episodes were ran locally on various networks in markets.
Quite a change, and following Rue McClanahan and Betty White's departure the series underwent a revamp. As a result it added two new characters Iola Boylan (played hilariously by Beverly Archer) and Bubba Higgins (Eunice and Ed's delinquent hormonal son, played perfectly by Allan Kayser).

The first season of this retooled version has some funny scenarios
Including Mama in an Arm Wrestling tournament and Aunt Effie temporarily staying with the family after being hospitalized for a mild concussion.

The special features are nice.
Season three is a must own.",1394150400,,779,5.429752066115703

The third season (in my opinion) is when the show starts getting really good. They changed up the cast. Grand kids are gone, and Bubba and Iola are in.

8624335,5,B00GLT2SOA,"This is a great season which contains one of my favorite episodes, ""Cat's Meow,"" where Iola suffers the death of her cat, Midnight, but then decides to have him freeze dried to keep him around and her happy. However, after she surprises Mama with the frozen kitty, she leaves the cat in Thelma's care only for the cat to turn up missing. Vint, Naomi and Bubby think they'd killed the cat, when in reality, he had already been dead. Almost every line in that episode is great. I also love this season because it was right when the show went into syndication and there's just something about seasons 3-6 of this series that feel a lot more put together and professional than seasons 1 and 2 (not that they're any less funny).",1528156800,,723,4.484848484848484

8624342,5,B00GLT2SOA,"There can be something of a divide between Mamas Family fans. Some prefer the NBC episodes that portray a more serious family dynamic while others prefer the more slapstick episodes where the characters become goofier and the situations outlandish. I belong to this later second camp because I remember these episodes airing on the local FOX affiliate during the late 1980s early 1990s and nostalgia tends to paint with a heavy brush.

The season begins with Aunt Frans funeral (she dies in the most sitcom way) and Bubba getting out of juvenile hall. The introduction of Bubba and Iola give us some of the series greatest moments, freeze dried dead cat anyone? But I also thought they gave the show a more human edge as Mama has a confidant in Iola, who can also drive her crazy at any given moment. Mama also has to confront some of her past parenting mistakes with through Bubba.

Mama embraces the modern family and leaves us all lost in laughter",1500681600,,950,4.682634730538922
