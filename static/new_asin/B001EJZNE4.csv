3555312,5,B001EJZNE4,"Cook's Country is one of the most enjoyable cooking shows I've ever watched because it is super interesting and funny. As a cookbook author myself I can relate to finding the secrets to great recipes.

The cooks on this show really do their homework so by the time they have a recipe perfected it is really spectacular. This saves you a lot of time and money. Some of the recipes on disc 1 include: Chocolate Blackout Cake, Strawberry Poke Cake, Garlic Roast Beef, Mashed Potato Casserole, Sunday Gravy, Barbecued Pulled Pork Sandwiches, Coleslaw, Potato Salad, Extra-Crunchy Buttermilk Fried Chicken and an amazing Raspberry Chiffon Pie.

Some of the interesting things I learned or at least started to understand more was how dairy tends to mute the flavor of chocolate. I use fat-free milk with my Dutch-process cocoa and my chocolate cake always turns out fantastic. But it was useful to learn that I'm using the right cocoa.

During the show there are little segments where Christopher Kimball tastes hot dogs and pie crust and chocolate. He has excellent taste and can spot a winner. He also knows how to clean cast iron pans which is helpful. He also grows his own potatoes so knew exactly what type of potato to use in the potato salad. I was surprised to learn that it is best to start potatoes in cold water.

The only things with these DVDs is that you have to fast forward through all the commercials at the start of each show. Otherwise it is all good. I especially like the ends of the shows where Christopher Kimball and his favorite chefs/recipe testers enjoy the sheer ecstasy of tasting what they have created. When they eat the Raspberry Chiffon Pie they are nearly speechless.

Disc two contains the following recipes: Broiled Steaks, Superstuffed Baked Potatoes, Classic Barbecued Chicken, Best Potluck Mac and Cheese, Smoked Double-Thick Pork Chops, Tennessee Whisky Glazed Pork Chops, Chicago Ribs, Cincinnati Chili, California Barbecued Tri-Tip, Diner Style Omelets and Home Fries. Everything looks delicious.

3555313,5,B001EJZNE4,I  enjoy the show every Saturday. I'm glad that I can now watch it when ever I wish. The staff is a hard working group of people who spend many hours testing different recipes helping us with a better and many times faster way of preparing many different dishes. I thank everyone at the Cooks Country for helping us learn a better way of cooking.,1357344000,6,346,4.323076923076923
3555314,5,B001EJZNE4,"I recently started watching Cooks Country on T.V. because it was too hot to work outside. I have watched many cooking shows, but, most are a tad too fancy for me. However, Cooks Country / Americas Test Kitchen really appealed to me.  They keep things simple, show you how to save money, buy good quality and tasty items on a budget. They make it interesting! I like the videos because they can show you technique, something you don't get with just a paper recipe. I'm retired now and plan to learn more cooking. I will purchase more of their videos as I have not seen any of the first 10 or 11 seasons. I have also purchased a few of their suggested pieces of kitchen equipment and have been satisfied with all. I find the videos very handy for a quick reference to go back to.
Thank You, ATK & CC  Rehd",1346889600,13,803,4.276315789473684
3555315,5,B001EJZNE4,"I can not get enough of this show.  I just started watching the show this year and now want to go back and see all the shows I have missed.  Along with great recipes, they give cooking dos and don'ts, taste tests, and reviews of all things for cooking.
They will actually show examples of cooking gone wrong!  Love that. I also have 2 of their cookbooks which are illustrated and will explain why they pick a certain process, this advice I need because sometimes I may try and cut corners if I don't understand why I need to follow instructions exactly.

Highly reccommend!!! I will be buying these cookbooks and DVDs for Christmas presents.",1331856000,11,641,4.547826086956522
