The two initial members of the Bling Ring asked themselves an initial question before starting their rash of celebrity burglaries.
""Who would leave a door unlocked? Who would leave a lot of money lying around?""
They came to the same conclusion -- Paris Hilton. And their assumption was right.
First they rang the doorbell. No one answered. They found the key under the doormat and entered the house.
Nick Prugo stood watch at the bottom of the stairs and Rachel Lee went through Paris' bedroom.
They, and their eventual four other members, would hit the Hilton residence five more times before being detected. They overreached when they stole $2 million in jewelry. Other homes on their list included Audrina Patridge, Rachel Bilson, Orlando Bloom, Miranda Keer, Brian Austin Green, Megan Fox and Lindsay Lohan. The more they stole the more brazen they became. They often photographed themselves in the act, posing in clothes they had lifted, sold some of the goods at yard sales and made use of Facebook. They would follow information on Facebook, gossip sites and tweets to determine when celebrities would be out of town and away from their homes.
In total, it's estimated their theft reached about $3 million in cash and belongings.
The Bling Ring stays pretty true to the story, starting at the pairing of Nick and Rachel, up until their arrest in Aug. 2009, about 10 months after their first break-in.
Lee was sentenced to four years. Prugo is expected to hear his fate in May 2012. He is supposedly working on a deal with prosecutors related to three of the others, Diana Tamayo, 21; Courtney Leigh Ames, 21; and Roy Lopez Jr., 29.",1335916800,2,1695,4.844827586206897
4851520,3,B005O9MH4O,That there needs to be two movies about this story says a lot about celebrity obsession in the US.  This is more informative than the  glitter fest that is the Sofia Coppola movie.,1389139200,,180,4.424242424242424
4851521,1,B005O9MH4O,"Don't bother. Get the Coppola version. It is much more entertaining than this snoozefest. Keep searching until you find the ""right"" version of this movie.",1386633600,,154,5.2
4851522,5,B005O9MH4O,"I never read the Vanity Fair article about the Bling Ring or caught any of the PR, so I came to this version and the 2013 DVD of Sophia Coppola's film fresh.  I have to say the Lifetime version of The Bling Ring is funnier, sexier, campier, and overall much more enjoyable.  The Coppola take is obviously more expensively produced, but there's overkill: way too many shots of shiny stuff being ogled and stolen.  Both versions do highlight the sociopathic narcissism of these thieving, empty-headed kids and the cluelessness of their parents, but the Lifetime movie surprisingly has more tension and doesn't drag the way Coppola's version does.  Its tone is just right, and there's no attempt to seduce you with surfaces.",1381708800,4,721,4.885245901639344
4851523,5,B005O9MH4O,Bought For a Xmas Gift. Good Price Fast Shipping Perfect Condition and it was on the xmas list so works for me.,1380758400,,111,4.090909090909091
4851524,1,B005O9MH4O,"This was a lifetime movie when I thought I was getting the cinema version. It wasn't interesting at all. It's my fault, I should have checked more carefully.",1379635200,,157,4.642857142857143
4851525,3,B005O9MH4O,like alot of people say the only reason it keeps you wanting to watch is because it was a true story other than that i probably would not sit through all of it.,1377129600,,160,3.878787878787879
4851526,5,B005O9MH4O,"I thought this was the movie with emma watson in it, but I watched the whole thing even when I realized it was a different version of the bling ring. Lifetime gets a bad rap sometimes, but this movie is excellent. Very good acting.",1375056000,,231,4.2727272727272725
4851527,3,B005O9MH4O,"I thought I was purchasing the Sophia Coppola movie, so this made for tv version was not quite what I was expecting.  It was good, but the mediocre quality of the acting made it clear that this was the lower budget version. Entertaining, but not something I'd pay to watch again.",1373846400,,279,4.470588235294118
4851528,2,B005O9MH4O,You can tell this movie is from lifetime. I was looking for more of a docu then a drama flick,1372118400,,93,3.7
4851529,1,B005O9MH4O,"Terrible acting, terrible plot - unwatchable movie. I rarely stop halfway through a movie I paid for, but this one was just impossible to watch.",1365465600,5,144,4.8
8480950,2,B005O9MH4O,Wasn't all that interesting but for $1.99 it's decent.,1491004800,,54,5.111111111111111
8480951,5,B005O9MH4O,"BETTER than the Sophia Copolla one, and I love that movie. This version is much more realistic.",1476576000,,95,4.647058823529412
8480952,4,B005O9MH4O,This is a great Lifetime movie. Nice Saturday at home movie.,1471651200,,60,4.545454545454546
8480953,5,B005O9MH4O,"Great movie for it being a made for TV movie, I found this very good.  Most TV movies aren't, and I am usually very picky, but I found this very interesting and entertaining to watch.",1454544000,,183,4.228571428571429

8480956,5,B005O9MH4O,Good movie. Great condition.,1406505600,,28,6.25
8480957,4,B005O9MH4O,I almost confused this Lifetime version with the Sofia Coppola one (hers was dreadful)  This one I liked.  It wasn't so serious and dark.,1398124800,,137,4.666666666666667
8480958,3,B005O9MH4O,Obviously those who would consider watching this aren't looking for Shakespeare. If your guilty pleasure is a good Lifetime movie event you will be happy with this. If you are looking for accuracy in the actual events of the Bling Ring you will be a little disappointed. Lifetime has taken some artistic liberties here and has changed up the actual events a bit. In a nutshell this is fun to watch if you are looking for some mindless easy entertainment.,1393977600,,454,4.6875
