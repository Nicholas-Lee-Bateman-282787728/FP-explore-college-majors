8240561,5,B00114UUF4,I bought this just to have Lady Godiva Rides. Ahhhhhhh late night Cinemax memories.....,1418601600,,87,5.285714285714286
8240562,4,B00114UUF4,"""Fugitive Girls"", co-written by Ed Wood, is a very fun B-sexploitation movie. Five women prisoners break out and are on the run. ""Fugitive Girls"" has naked breasts, bad acting, lesbians, hippies, bikers, hairy men, and that great Ed Wood dialogue. See the trailer for yourself on YouTube: search for ""Exploitica - Fugitive Girls"". This is the sort of movie Quentin Tarantino loves, roughly like ""Switchblade Sisters"". It's a B-movie with attitude: what it lacks in budget it makes up for in nudity, tough talk, and campy scenes. If one approaches it like Mystery Science 3000, there's a lot of unintended silliness to enjoy. Note that the movie does not closely resemble the famous Ed Wood movies of the 1950's, such as ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". ""Fugitive Girls"" does not have the extremely strange filmmaking style of Wood's early films, but it does have his boldness and campiness. The print on the DVD is a little dusty and faded, but it looks okay. The DVD also includes the trailer, a few still photos, and a textual biography of Ed Wood.

""Drop Out Wife"" is 1970's soft core porn. The movie goes from one sex scene to another, with brief dialogue in between. Even as soft core porn, the movie is mediocre, because most of the actresses are plain and the sex scenes are very repetitive. Most sex scenes are missionary, but there is also an orgy and a few lesbians. I think this movie would mostly interest anyone curious about or nostalgic for 1970's soft core porn, because it does have a lot of attributes of 1970's porn: funky music, dubbed moaning, and camera tricks. There is very little here to engage Ed Wood fans. Even though Ed Wood co-wrote the screenplay, there is very little dialogue, and it mostly just serves as a transition to the next sex scene. I recommend ""Fugitive Girls"" instead.",1326844800,3,1806,4.733333333333333
8240563,5,B00114UUF4,"Here we have two of the best 1970's films from the team of Edward D. Wood Jr. and Stephen C. Apostolof, 1972's ""Drop Out Wife"" and 1974's ""Fugitive Girls"", as well as Apostolof's 1969 flick ""Lady Godiva Rides"". This set is largely superseded by S'more Entertainment's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Box-Of-Wood/dp/B004XC5LO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Box Of Wood</a>, which includes the two collaborative efforts here (and much, much more), but at the moment this is the only release of the complete version of ""Lady Godiva Rides"", necessary for all Apostolof enthusiasts.
This 3-disc set is a great introduction to the duo's work at any rate.",1326067200,2,696,6.040404040404041
8240564,2,B00114UUF4,"The Lacivious World of A. C. Stevens & Ed D. Wood is a 3 disk set of containing 3 movies from two of the most inept film makers ever.  The most entertaining of the 3 movies is ""Lady Godiva Rides"", however it is entertaining only because it is laughably bad.  The sets (especially the ""boat"" to America) are ridiculous, the action is unbelievably out of character for the time period, and the dialogue is as bad as it gets.  There is some nudity and sexual activity, but even that is incompetently done.  The other 2 movies are bad, but don't fall into the category of ""so bad they're good"".  I found ""Fugitive Girls"" just boring and a little hard to follow, and ""Drop-Out Wife"" was overwrought and mostly about the sex, with some scenes bordering on hard-core.  If getting 1 movie that is laughably bad out of a 3 movie set is enough for you, then this is a good purchase.  Otherwise...pass.",1298851200,,891,4.462962962962963
8240565,2,B00114UUF4,"Add me to the list of extremely disappointed ""Fugitive Girls"" fans here. I have two old VHS copies of this film that run 90 minutes, and compared them with the DVD once I realized some of the strongest scenes were hacked to pieces. The cover art boasts, ""FOR ADULTS ONLY"", which is pretty ridiculous. Even if the best quality print they could find was missing six minutes of the movie (these aren't pointless scenes of gratuitous nudity or even near-X material, there's important dialog and character development in each one, believe it or not), they still should have included the real versions on the DVD. It really would have made a huge difference. I award one star because they even cared to put this on DVD, and another because the movie looks good.",1245456000,17,755,4.684210526315789
8240566,2,B00114UUF4,"If you are looking for the whimsy that Wood produced in Plan 9, Bride of the Monster etc. it isn't in this collection. These three films are basically sex films, not that there is anything wrong with that. The production quality is cheap, the acting isn't very good, the naked people are ordinary looking. So, if you are an Ed Wood ""completist"" that this is for you. if you like films with lots of sex, you can find better ones.",1210982400,16,428,4.3625
