We need shows like this over here! Hear that Hollywood?",1455753600,,326,4.360655737704918

8661475,5,B00KTOPH9Q,"A truly awesome series.  Count Dracula's only son, Vlad, wants to be a normal boy.  Watch as Vlad continually gets his father and sister out of trouble while trying to find a cure for vampirism.  Throw in a couple of human friends and Vlad has a very demanding life.  The end of season two ends this series as a children friendly show but season three picks up four years later with the same cast of actors playing the Dracula clan as a darker drama.  This series actually grew with its viewers.  The only sad part of this series is that it ended with season five, the best one in my opinion.  I would love ten more seasons but if it never gets renewed have no fear because like all great shows it does not leave you wondering for eternity.",1410393600,2,740,4.280575539568345
8661476,3,B00KTOPH9Q,"Wow.  I collect vampire movies and TV shows, so this had to go into the collection.  Still looking for the last couple of seasons. The discs came in decent packaging and on time.  Plays okay as well.
I think that Dracula The Series with Geordie Johnson, Jacob Tierney and Mia Kirshner was a lot more fun.",1409529600,,304,4.392857142857143
