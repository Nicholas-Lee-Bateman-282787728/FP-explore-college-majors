6898647,5,B00R4GBZNE,"The full title is ""Roald Dahl's Esio Trot"" but that's such a cumbersome name for such a tidy, satisfying little film. It's unrated but let me assure you, there are no sweaty bodies, no guns, no vehicular mayhem or blowie uppie stuff. Just a sweet little character study and (we hope) a love story.

Directed by Dearbhla Walsh (""Little Dorrit"") and adapted from Mr. Dahl's story by Richard Curtis (""Love Actually"") and Paul Mayhew-Archer (""Mrs. Brown's Boys""), this sweet romance for seniors is just the ticket for a quiet summer evening. I bought my Region 2 DVD from Amazon a few weeks ago, so we can always hope it will be in Region 1 format very soon.

We see an apartment building that has its share of retired people as well as families, but we become most involved with an American retired in England, who tends the flowers blooming on his balcony and casts longing looks at a the lovely widow who lives below with her tortoise.

Our cast:
  * Dustin Hoffman (""Last Chance Harvey"") is Mr. Hoppy, shy, tongue-tied and awkward. Also lonely.
  * Judi Dench (""Philomena"") Lavinia is his gregarious neighbor, always flirty, upbeat and positive. Also lonely.
  * Richard Cordery (""Mr. Turner"") Mr. Pringle is a pushy neighbor who invites himself to Mr. Hoppy's apartment for dinner. He is boorish, rude and always hungry. Also lonely.
  * James Corden (""Into the Woods"") is our narrator. He is on his way across town, catching trams, dodging traffic and getting on the wrong bus, but he drops the fourth wall to explain what is going on and why our characters do what they do. He isn't lonely.

Several things set this delicious little story apart, but to me the thing that first comes to mind is the sound track. Louis Armstrong sings, ""In My Solitude,"" ""A Kiss to Build a Dream On,"" ""Hello Dolly,"" and ""Kiss Me Once (and Kiss Me Twice)"" to keep us people of a certain age smiling all the way.

I found the plethora of turtles (yes, I said TURTLES!) to be a bit disconcerting, but they are appropriate to the story. Well, given the title of the movie, I concede that Spartacus is actually a tortoise....",1459555200,2,2104,4.623655913978495

6898651,5,B00R4GBZNE,"Saw it on television unexpectedly.  Had been waiting nearly a year to see it after I heard about it being made.  Absolutely loved it!  Two pensioners, one shy (Hoffman) and one outgoing (Dench) find love thanks to Alfie, a tortoise.  Alas, the DVD is not available for Region 1 in the USA.",1450742400,2,289,4.5
6898652,5,B00R4GBZNE,"This is truly a wonderful film.  I saw it on TV and went immediately to my computer to purchase it....to no avail.  It isn't available in the USA.

The story is about two senior citizens who are attracted to each other, but both are too shy to talk to each other about their feelings.  So they go to elaborate lengths to try to start a relationship.  I think this is a movie for everyone, but especially for senior citizens.  For all those who have lost or never had partners, it shines a ray of uplifting hope that  such a thing could still happen.  And the stars, Dustin Hoffman and Judi Dench, are absolutely perfect in their roles.

This is on my personal list of my five favorite movies of all time.",1450569600,6,704,4.312977099236641
6898653,5,B00R4GBZNE,This movie was a chance viewing. And has now become one I am referring to everyone. Such an adorable and heartwarming movie full of laughter and love.,1449792000,3,150,4.592592592592593

8694022,2,B00R4GBZNE,I LOVE this little movie.  It is dear and such a sweet representation above what love truly looks like in real life!  Great Actors!  I saw this movie originally on TV.  I ordered this copy and can't play it on anything in the U.S.  There was no indication warning about this when I bought it.  I was so disappointed and when I emailed the source....there was no help toward a solution of obtaining a copy that can be played on U.S. equipment.  For this I would have given it no stars.... but the movie I would give 5 stars!,1522627200,,523,4.222222222222222

8694024,5,B00R4GBZNE,"Brilliant movie, perhaps Hoffman's best role.  Only downside is that you need a multi-region DVD to screen it.",1500163200,,110,5.111111111111111

My favorite feel-good movie of all time. I literally jumped out of my chair when it ended and gave it a long and enthusiastic standing ovation!",1484006400,,319,5.153846153846154
8694029,3,B00R4GBZNE,"DVD arrived as scheduled. Keep in mind if you are going to purchase this in the United States it is a bit tricky to get to work. It did not work on my new ThinkPad laptop but did work on an older version - after switching the setting on the computer to play that specific type of DVD. Apparently, you can only switch those settings 6 times or so on a single laptop. The movie was great from an adult's perspective! Showing it to my 4th grade students though, there were about 8 spots where I had to either mute or fast forward due to the humor being too adult. Wonderful movie! Great delivery! A little bit on a struggle to play, but it the end the students loved it. They said it was worth it, even with the interruptions.",1481846400,,723,4.171428571428572
8694030,5,B00R4GBZNE,Very cute movie.  I live in the US and have a multi region DVD player  and a 60 inch flatscreen TV which I bought three years ago  and the DVD played just fine with no problems.,1475366400,,177,3.861111111111111
