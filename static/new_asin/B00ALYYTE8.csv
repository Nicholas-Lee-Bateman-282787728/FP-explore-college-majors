5449763,5,B00ALYYTE8,"I have always been a fan of tv and film espionage. I was a huge fan of Alias and Nikita, and a big fan of James Bond, Mission Impossible, Bourne, etc. When I heard of another spy tv series with a kick-a** female lead, I was very excited, but I wondered what they would do to make this show original from past shows. To say the least, I was very impressed with the choices made. A short 8-episode season worked great because it gave the writers the time to write a main overall plot without any random pointless episodes stuck in the middle.

It had the action and excitement of shows like Alias and Nikita, but also had a dark and well written overall storyline similar to Homeland and The Americans. Sure, some people don't like the show because some of it is a little over-the-top, but that's why we like these shows. I mean, who wants to watch a James Bond film if he couldn't do all the amazing stuff that he does? Espionage tv is supposed to take it to the next level. And personally, I think it did a great job! Hopefully Cinemax picks this up for another season. But if not, I was satisfied with the ending of season 1.",1365206400,15,1126,4.261682242990654

5449765,5,B00ALYYTE8,"I saw the complete series on TV in the UK and in my opinion it's not to be missed.

It centers around the female character Sam Hunter who works for a private intelligence agency. She has 'Bond' type encounters throughout the series so it's full of action.

It starts out in Tangiers where she survives an attempt on her life and is left for dead.

After hiding out in Scotland and training to full health returns to London for an assignment to infiltrate ruthless criminal Jack Turner's house.

She wants to find out who tried to have her killed and can trust no one in the team she's working, with or the house she's infiltrated for her latest assignment.

She has frequent flashbacks to her childhood when she witnessed her mothers death and her kidnap and these are connected to her current assignment.

Filmed on location in Tangiers, Scotland and London, gives depth to the series.

There is a lot of violence which I normally avoid but persevere with this it's an excellent series with many complex twist and turns and an excellent cast.

Can't wait for another series.",1358121600,27,1075,4.650793650793651
5449766,3,B00ALYYTE8,"i really love this type of show, and believe the concept of the show was outstanding. It is amazingly a lot of fun to imagine what your approach would be and measure it by comparable strategies used by the contestants. Watch and try, it's a fun time.  The implementation of the show does leave room for improvement. First off, you can learn a lot about the mindset and tools of real world top tier investigators. I've watched a lot of these type shows and I did learn tricks on this show I've never seen before.  I won't spoil it for you, but this is a major win for this show. These investigators are the real deal.  The down side of the show is that the fugitives are either utterly inept or totally unlikable. We binge watched the season and found it a fun watch. For us it was almost, but not quite, on par with Alone on the history channel (Alone seemed to have better production). It did seem like this show was abusing investigative resources for some situations, so it's not surprising the show didn't get picked up for season 2.

I think all the action around it is a bit over-dramatized yet in the end it keeps a compelling pace and your interest peaked.

5449803,4,B00ALYYTE8,"There are a lot of plot elements in this series that don't make much sense -- and I mean far beyond the usual way spy thrillers don't often make sense. But, the actors are so earnest that they pull all the twists and turns off. Kudos especially to Melissa George because she's physically tiny but really convinces you she could beat up grown men.

It's a shame this series didn't continue past the first season. But, if it had, we might have had a very different Game of Thrones cast, as half a dozen of the actors in Hunted are in GoT.

All of the plot lines weren't wrapped up by the end of the season, but it came to a satisfactory enough conclusion that you don't feel like it ended on a cliffhanger and you'll never know what happened.",1477267200,,740,4.2785714285714285
5449804,5,B00ALYYTE8,"It's hard to think of a more shadowy world than the private intelligence industry, which serves as the backdrop to Cinemax's exhilarating espionage thriller Hunted, a BBC co-production from X-Files writer-producer Frank Spotnitz.

It's a realm where spies and special-forces operatives are deployed to gather intelligence about corporations, individuals, or foreign governments - and sell it for a profit. Disturbing ethical questions abound: Should spy companies work for anyone with the money, no matter how questionable their ends?

That's just one of the fascinating issues that come up - among the gunplay, knifeplay, explosive Krav Maga dances, and love-making - in Hunted. The remarkably capable, assured, and sexy Melissa George stars as Sam Hunter, a top operative at one of England's most powerful spy shops. Housed in a neo-byzantine glass, concrete, and steel maze in London, the company has one of the most melodramatic names on TV - Byzantium.

The series opens in mid-mission - and in flagrante delicto. It's a hot summer night in Tangier; Sam and a North African smooth-'n'-suave terrorist dude named Bernard Faroux (Dhaffer L'Abidine) are slipping out of their clothes in a passionate embrace. It's true love!

Of course not. Sam is an operative; he's a target.

In a terrifically edited sequence out of Mission: Impossible, Sam and her spy partner and lover, Aidan Marsh (Adam Rayner), foil Faroux's plans and recover a scientist imprisoned in his dungeons. (Who hired Sam's company? The scientist's employers who want him safely returned? Or a rival terrorist who wants to kill him? See the conundrum?)

Things go south when Sam asks to meet Aidan for some post-mission R&R at their fave cafe. He doesn't show up. She's gunned down at their meeting point by vicious-looking thugs. (She kills every one of them before passing out, of course.) Sam is terrified: Did Aidan betray her? Who wants her dead?

Hunted is a complex, if at times overly baroque, conspiracy thriller that takes Sam on a strange quest. To find out who wants her dead, she will have to uncover an international conspiracy that would put Dan Brown to shame.

At a full 60 minutes, each of the season's eight episodes packs a movie-size punch and takes the viewer deeper into the maze. Despite its occasional heavy-handedness, Hunted will give genre junkies a real high - and some food for thought.

Spotnitz has said he wants to make a second season but as of this writing (March 2016) it's been three-and-a-half-years and there's no sign the show is coming back. George has moved on first to The Slap and now her new, gloosy network drama Heartbeat. It's a shame: There's so much the show could do with the character.

5449818,3,B00ALYYTE8,"I love great spy thrillers, like MI5 or 24 or Alias.  But this is not in the same league.

I was wondering why, and i think it has a lot to do with the face that the female lead does not have a strong talented ensemble cast, with their own story lines, to strengthen the plot.  MI5 has the main agents, and then Harry - and always a superb cast of well- explored characters.  Alias was always focused on Garner, but you got to know the other characters and their stories really well too.  Here, 99% rests on George - she does her best, but its too much for one person to carry off.  I guess they were going more for the one-person superspy model, like Bond or Bourne, but its still a little weak.  The characters, including George, often look like their pouting or just hanging out, instead of looking tortured or being on edge or tense, as the scene might demand.  But overall, its still entertaining and very watchable.",1398038400,,921,4.345029239766082

Such a deviation from standard DVD functionality should have been plastered in bold letters across the front of the box, with a clear warning on the product page, but there is no warning on the product page, and the fine print on the very bottom of the back of the box requires a magnifying glass. Such a deceptive practice is just false advertising.

8553453,4,B00ALYYTE8,"Hunted stars Melissa George (probably best known for her role on the TV series Alias) as Sam Hunter, an operative for an elite private security firm called Byzantium.  During a mission her identity is given up, she is shot and left for dead.  She returns to her job after a year and essentially balances the season between trying to find out who betrayed her and taking down a local mobster.

The show really did have potential, but will ultimately leave you feeling kind of flat because the major plot line is not resolved (the show anticipated a second season that it never got) so while the mobster story line gets resolved a lot is left open as a cliff hanger.  There were attempts to revive the show in some way, either as additional seasons or some kind of spin off series that never materialized.  So the first season story that does get told is okay, even though somewhat predictable.  The supporting cast was good (most notable among them is probably Adam Rymer who would go on to play one of the leads in the FX show Tyrant), and the writing and acting were decent for a show of this type.

The show aired on Cinemax, and it had a similar feel as shows like Banshee and Strike Back.  Although it may not have had as much violence and sex as those shows did, there was definitely some of each in this one, and when there was violence it was not tame.  The DVD release was a very basic MOD release, with no subtitles, deleted scenes or behind the scenes material of any kind.  Just the 8 episodes spread across two discs.

As my headline says the show will probably leave you unsatisfied because it basically ends not on a total cliff hanger, but with a lot unresolved, and after 5 years off the air it is not likely to come back in any form.  If you can accept that what you do get is good, but not great.",1502496000,2,1814,4.334319526627219

Don't bother to buy the season if you're going to give it a try buy a couple episodes.",1499472000,,416,3.8823529411764706

8553457,2,B00ALYYTE8,I got the sense that the show hunted the participants with inside information. There is no way they could narrow down some of these people without knowing what they were doing a head of time. Some contestants had it harder than others. Way harder! The fix was in!!! Staged reality TV. The show is go though for showing you the many ways you can be tracked and traced. Stuff that only law enforcement would know.,1497916800,,411,4.493333333333333
