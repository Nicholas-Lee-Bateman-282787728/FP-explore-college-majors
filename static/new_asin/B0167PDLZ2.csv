7462049,4,B0167PDLZ2,"This film is well worth watchingas long as you don't expect it to make any sense. It contains about a dozen stories, embedded in one another (like nesting Russian dolls, as the editorial review says) or fading in and out of each other, all invested with the overwrought melodrama of the old silent films that clearly inspired the work as a whole: the innumerable characters (and the actors who play them) are introduced, and most of the plot points are explained, by silent-movie-style title cards, for instance. The sense of over the top is so great that at times I expected the stories to reveal themselves as Monty Python skits any second (a bladder-slapping contest? vampire bananas??)but I was never sure whether Maddin intended the audience to be laughing or not. Lets just say surreal, to say the least or suspend your disbelief and your story sense on the convenient hooks on the door as you enter and let it go at that.

The main reason for sitting through two hours of this, in my opinion, is the visuals. They, too, clearly draw inspiration from old film, except that they are brightly colored, as if shot through various colored filters. They break up, distort, and fade into one another as shots on disintegrating film might do. Theyre a real feast for the eyes. If you can turn your mind off and just let all the beautifully morphing craziness flow past you, I think you will really enjoy this trip.",1458172800,6,1413,4.674698795180723
7462050,5,B0167PDLZ2,"A truly unique movie. It deserves five stars for the visual style alone. Nothing can prepare the viewer for Maddin's use of color, imagery, and texture (except for, perhaps, another of his movies). At times this can become a little overwhelming, but as is the case with any truly psychedelic experience, the best advice is probably to just ""sit back, relax, and enjoy the show"". Everything is in motion in this movie: the visuals, the dialogue, and the plot.

Some people might say that the plot is meaningless or nihilistic, but this conclusion misses the mark entirely. This is a mythological movie, a towering machine composed of strange symbols and situations which, if examined in isolation, would indeed seem meaningless. If you're willing to make connections between these symbols and situations, it will seem far from meaningless, instead overflowing with an excess of meaning. Everything is overdetermined in the world of ""The Forbidden Room"", every point in time is the intersection of innumerable variables streaming in from the past and rushing forward to the future. This is not a movie for theorists, who must come to some kind of definitive conclusion about its nature. This is a movie for the viewer, specifically the viewer who wants allow their experience to wash over their body like waves in a bubblebath.",1458000000,11,1325,5.050228310502283
7462051,4,B0167PDLZ2,"Interesting and fun. Somewhat like Fellini meets Monty Python. Let's put it like this, I liked it. It wasn't something I would watch every day. The central narrative was there but almost like a partially erased pencil line, sometimes challenging to find and follow. I liked the clamshell nature of the film - the first half leads us in, the second leads us out. The acting, overall, was good. Like I said,  I liked it and I am a systems analyst. However, my other, who is an artist, walked out after 5 minutes and declared ""life is too short for bad movies"".

However, we all DO live in a sinking submarine... and depend on the flapjacks of life to keep us alive.....",1457827200,3,667,4.459016393442623
7462052,1,B0167PDLZ2,"The Forbidden Room,"" directed by Canadian Guy Maddin, is characterized by references to silent cinema, odd use of color, multiple layers of plot, and surrealistic images. Extremely dense and hard to fathom, its nearly two-hours is a tough cinematic experience, particularly for those unfamiliar with Maddins earlier films and offbeat style.

The film opens with a prologue in which a dressing-gown-clad narrator (Louis Negin) provides instructions on how to take a bath, the bathwater representing the ocean. The film then switches to the crew of a doomed submarine eating pancakes in a desperate attempt to breathe the oxygen within them. Inexplicably, a lost woodsman wanders into their company and tells of escaping from a fierce clan of cave dwellers. From this point, Maddin and co-director Evan Johnson take us high into the air, around the world, and into a series of dreamscapes, offering tales of amnesia, captivity, deception, murder, skeleton women, and vampire bananas. Like an onion, the film is made up of multiple layers of imagery and story.

Though initially fascinating, the movie soon wears thin because its virtually impossible to follow any single thread of a story. As a much shorter, experimental film, The Forbidden Room might have been more sustainable, but as a feature, its extreme obscurity makes it seem like a vanity project for Maddin. The movie distances viewers rather than drawing them in.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include audio commentary with Guy Maddin and Evan Johnson; Once a Chicken, a seance with Lazslo Moholy-Nagy; and a booklet with essays.",1457136000,6,1596,5.2265625
7462053,5,B0167PDLZ2,"This makes a great addition to the vast dreamscape that is Maddin's filmography.  The ""structure"" of this film reminds me of David Lynch's ""Inland Empire.""  The components aren't entirely unrelated, but they are related more like the beads of a necklace are related than related like the parts of a puppy are related.  If you take a puppy apart, you won't get it back together again, but, while the beads of a necklace have a common thread running through them and are in a particular order and such, if they fell off of or were removed from the necklace, they would remain beads indefinitely and could be reassembled in the same or even a different order at some other time.  They don't depend on each other for their existence.

I enjoy Maddin's sort of neo-steampunk style immensely.  It's nostalgic simultaneously for what was and for what has never been but maybe could have been, and you have to believe that Maddin believes, SHOULD have been.  On second viewing, you'll see stuff you don't even remember from the first watching.  I'm not sure this movie can even BE remembered.  It IS the memory of itself.  You'll probably have to watch it each time you want to recall it.  See it more than once then buy it for your collection.",1449532800,14,1236,4.623853211009174
7462054,5,B0167PDLZ2,"A loving parody of old movies that is visually stunning in its reproduction of old film stocks of every type and condition, and is sustained throughout by brilliant absurdist humor ... who wouldn't love that? OK, also consider this: although one story is clearly the most important, there are no less than 16 other parody plotlines (or distinct plotline fragments), and they are all intercut wildly, with stories nested within stories (up to 8 or 9 levels deep), and with the connections following the fevered logic of dreams rather than anything a rational mind would cook up. And if that still sounds like a good thing in small doses, there's two hours of it. But if you're still onboard, you're in for a one of the great cinematic experiences of your life. (And you may already be a Guy Maddin fan.)

The movie's origin (as relayed by director and co-writer Maddin himself, at a special screening at the Harvard Film Archive before its Boston theatrical run there) is nearly as interesting as the film itself. Maddin has always been very into -- OK, obsessed with -- old movies, especially those in the transition between silent movies and talkies, where dialogue and title cards freely cohabited. And he has long been fascinated by the fact that the vast majority of old movies have been lost; they are known only by plot synopses, posters, or sometimes just an intriguing title. ""Fist of a Cripple,"" anyone?

So he created a combination museum art installment and interactive Internet experience to pay homage to these lost films. In Paris and later in Montreal, he'd gather a cast and film crew, and over the course of a day, in public, shoot a short film parody based on a given title. (I should note that ""parody"" is not quite right; it seems as if the working assumption is that the lost films were likely so clichd that they approached self-parody. Take that as a starting point, and invent absurd twists on the clichs, and you've got it.) The Internet project is called Seances -- it's the French word for ""screenings,"" but it also evokes the idea that Maddin and gang are ritually invoking the spirits of the lost films, inviting them back down to our realm (which is something they actually did at the start of each day's work, less than seriously, of course). The web project will appear in the spring; each visit to the website will be a unique experience, with a newly generated title, and a new film assembled by software from fragments of the 34 completed films.

But in the meantime, the folks funding the project asked that Maddin also assemble a feature film from the best of the material. What a break! Maddin says he resisted the idea at first, but the glorious result shows how deeply he and his collaborators got into the idea. Maddin decided he wanted to overwhelm viewers with the sheer quantity of story, and although that will end up fatiguing some viewers, I think it's a crucial and correct choice. For many viewers, the sheer variety of story will justify the length. And the film gradually becomes a moving celebration not just of the early, primitive days of cinema, but, much more universally, of the glory of story itself, and ultimately, of the necessity of story structure, no mean feat for a film that has studiously (OK, sometimes hilariously) avoided all semblance of coherent structure for its first 110 minutes.

Maddin has always been a cult director, but The Forbidden Room has the potential to transform him into ... a considerably better known cult director.  His films have always had a slyly absurd sense of humor, but he admits that until now, he had essentially hedged his humor bets. He didn't want to risk going for an obvious joke and failing, so he wanted anything that some people might think was funny to also play seriously. So audiences would watch his films, and those who Got It would ... smile.

Granted, the audience at the screening I attended were self-selected Maddin fans, but we didn't merely smile; we laughed out loud, and we laughed a lot. As in, more or less continuously. Maddin's appeal will still be limited to those who are taken with his visual style and the dreamlike logic of his films, but The Forbidden Room adds two new elements, the overt humor and the parodic justification for the logic. To say it is his most accessible film yet is a large understatement.

It may also be his best film; its only rival is the deeply personal My Winnipeg, an acknowledged masterpiece among film buffs. I'm planning to see this new one again in December, and as soon as I post this review, I'm ordering the Blu-Ray. I can't wait to share this two hours of magic with everyone I know who loves film and loves story.",1447891200,16,4681,4.68734793187348

7462077,5,B0167PDLZ2,"Forbidden Room is an excellent homage to the silent film era, and pulp fiction themes from the late 19th century to the 1930's, sampling treatments of everything from Jules Verne, the Hollow Earth, to Edgar Rice Burroughs and Tarzan, but done in a most imaginative way.  The stiff acting in the Rescue Margot scene where Sapling Jacks meets the head bandit in the cave is deliberate on the part of Maddin, and he makes a point by it.  The point is given away by the fact that the background music playing is from the opening act of Wagner's second opera in the Ring of Niebelungen saga: Die Walkure.  The fact that Sapling Jacks speaks with bravado and machismo, combined with the primitiveness of the cave dwellers, makes for a great effect as a parody of the Pan European mythos of a superior Nordic race that is supposed to be the ""builders of civilization"" but yet is reduced down to the utmost primitive, ape-like behavior, from bladder slapping to offal piling.  I wonder if Maddin had encountered White Supremacist and Odinist Varg Vikernes in media or seen Varg's atrocious ""Forebears"" film about a bunch of neanderthal-like Nordics hunting and gathering in the northern wildernesses.  Because if he had, Maddin's response would read like a brilliant parody.

But then again, such a dichotomy and parodox of so-called ""European builders of civilization"" venerating the primitive Berzerker nordic neanderthal-ness of Machismo existed in the 19th century and played a large part in the run-up to the rise of Nazism.  This fits in so well with everything else in Forbidden Room like the colliding Zeppelins, the use of Laudanum as a recreational drug, and the graininess of silent film footage.  There are also odes and echoes of Nosferato in this movie, as well as sprinkles of German Expressionism.

Maddin proves himself to be a master of the art of cinema, worthy of a place among David Lynch, Kubrick, etc.",1465689600,2,1916,4.888888888888889

He takes you places but the narrative is so out there that it becomes more comic relief than anything else. Who knows, maybe that's the point. I'm not going to rag on this fella to much ... I'd like to be in a place were I to could make movies ... but not like this. And so this must be his good fortune ... not only can he make films but  he does and he can get away with this type of en devour.  More power to him ... the world awaits you next film.

It's a cross between Monty Python and David Lynch, at their most insane, and I admit I didn't know what the hell was going on, it was such fun to watch! Knowing Guy Maddin's history, perhaps there was no point, but the dialogue was corny, tacky and silly, and there were a few threads that kept the action intact. Love it or hate it, I was entertained and consistently amused. The touch of Tarantino (Grindhouse) is noticeable, regarding bad camera work, and the whole circus left me exhilarated and satisfied.
Don't take drugs; watch this film and you'll get the same effect.",1460160000,,645,4.666666666666667
7462082,1,B0167PDLZ2,"I ejected the DVD when I got to the guys trapped in the submarine. Figured I already wasted my money, but I could stop wasting my time.

In deference to the esteemed and learned ""Movie Snob"" I watched this movie in its entirety. I would like to say thank you to ""Movie Sob"" for giving me this opportunity. I would also like to say that my previous review was in error and ""The Forbidden Room"" is a cinemagraphic marvel reaching such unprecedented heights of art that words cannot describe the grandness of this achievement. I would like to say all these things, however, each statement would be a lie.

""The Forbidden Room"" is a total, irrevocable and complete waste of money and time. We start off with Marv explaining the history of baths before he then educates us on the proper method of running, entering, and bathing. Skip to the submarine where our hapless men are 50 fathoms under the surface with a load of explosive jelly that's gone bad and if they rise any, it will explode. As they eat flapjacks, the air bubbles in the flapjacks will double their air supply in the submarine, they hear banging, and then a mysterious man covered in leaves appears. Then we cut to the mysterious man and some lumberjacks talking about rescuing Margo from the Red Wolves. He alone goes and engages in feats of strength with the Red Wolf leader. They snap their fingers. They compare the relative weight of their penises against a stone on a scale. Then they slap a bladder. I mean, seriously, this is so stupid not even LSD would make it watchable. Margo then comes up with her own tests. We cut to her story, Margo with amnesia. In between we get explanation cards flashed in front of us like some silent era movie. Of course we have to get this information through images that jump left and right, are out of focus and with flashes and sepia tones to make it appear as though these cards are centuries old. This is nothing more than an annoyance and borders on causing an epileptic seizure. On and on it goes. Flashing and distorted images as the movie progresses.

The Forbidden Room is, if anything, a crowning achievement of weak storytelling and should be relegated to the trash heap, never to be seen again, unless its in a film making course titled How to Make an Awful Movie! If you cannot tell your story through imagery or dialogue, you fall back on the tried and true telephone call, or explanatory text.

7462084,3,B0167PDLZ2,"This is a very eccentric film that will not appeal to everyone. The cinematography is very good providing an 'early movie making' patina and pulls out all the stops. The storylines are a bit confusing and weird but also attempt to follow old familiar (if one has watched the super old films) plots. It's not a particularly cohesive film and in fact one may get the impression someone was on the weed when they wrote/designed this. For novel conceptions I'd give it five stars, visual stimulation four stars. For pure entertainment value I'd give it three stars, for mass appeal two stars. And for academy award material, one star (except for maybe novel conceptions). It was a hard choice and I'd likely settle on 3.5 stars if I could.
