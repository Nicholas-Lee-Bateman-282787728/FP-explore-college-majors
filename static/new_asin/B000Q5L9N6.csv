2829466,3,B000Q5L9N6,"yes the movie is good my only problem is the copy of the DVD, picture quality is good the english subtitles is also good its sync with the audio and video perfectly the translation is also good, my only problem is that the DVD menu is not in english, well if you play the disc and you got to the menu all you gotta do is press OK or select or play on your remote and it will play if you need to change audio setting or subtitle if you can't read korean just do it withe the remote while the movie is playing. besides that it's a good buy $13.00 it's  worth it.",1318550400,,560,3.912280701754386

2829468,5,B000Q5L9N6,BE CAREFUL-This was zoned so it wouldn't play on my U.S. zoned dvd/blu-ray player.  Had to watch it on the computer.  Still a great movie.  It would have been nice to know it was not zoned for U.S. play before I bought it.  Still my new favorite movie.,1302566400,,252,4.1875
2829469,5,B000Q5L9N6,"This movie is a morality tale, told with warmth and humor.  Miss Kim Ah Joong, a Republic of Korea singer/model/actress, has the lead role, as ""Hanna.""  A famous ""singer"" actually lip-syncs the lyrics while Hanna sings the songs back stage.  Hanna is secretly in love with her music producer, but she believes she has no chance with him unless she loses weight.  Hanna goes into secusion in a hospital for one year while she has plastic surgery.  She emerges as a beautiful and slender woman, now known as ""Jenny,"" who is not even recognized by her best friend.

Miss Kim won ""Best Actress Award"" for this movie, and she sings her own songs.  Her voice has a lovely sound, and is capable of a wide range.  She is a very beautiful, sweet-faced young woman with a charming manner and a lovely voice.

My favorite song is the one Jenny sings in an audition for a job as singer with the producer she loves.

Miss Kim shows in this movie that she is a wonderful comic and dramatic actress.  She has so many good scenes in the movie that it is difficult to site any particular one, but I suppose the first scene with her dog, named ""Love,"" is one of the best.  I also especially enjoyed the scene where she wears her first new outfit as a slender woman.

The movie is entirely in Korean except for the lyrics of one song, ""She's a Beautiful Girl,"" which is mostly sung by Miss Kim in English.  The movie does have English subtiles.

I highly recommend this movie for everyone.",1263772800,12,1470,4.432835820895522
2829470,5,B000Q5L9N6,I LOVE THIS MOVIE! It's really cute and original! Great acting as well! Kim Ah Joong should have her own album though. Her singing is really great! This is a must have!,1231200000,,168,4.28125
2829471,4,B000Q5L9N6,I had no expectations of the film when i started to watch but the young girl who played Hanna was adorable and drew me in to caring what happened to her character.  Yes it is a bit cliche and yes the premise of this film has been done several hundred times in different ways but I really liked the film.  It has a very sincere message about being liked for who you are on the inside.  Its a sweet piece of cinema and I will gladly watch it again on a rainy day when I don't want to think too hard.,1205712000,24,497,3.900990099009901
2829472,3,B000Q5L9N6,"First, I'm going to say that I'm more than a bit disappointed with the underlying themes in the film.  It was like a Korean twist of ""Shallow Hal,"" but thoroughly Korean in the sense that the film promotes the idea that overweight people are somehow inherently not as valuable or do not deserve to be loved equally as ""others.""  And it does a piss poor job of trying to salvage a ""plastic surgery is BAD, mmm KAY?"" message at the very, very end.

Oh, so it doesn't matter if overweight Hanna had the talent of a lifetime: she was overweight.  BUT HEY, when she got plastic surgery in Korea, her whole life took a turn for the better, and you know what?  It was ""okay"" to do so because she felt oh so remorseful... and oh yeah she was still beautiful.  That part is always nice.  Pretty easy to forgive a gorgeous talent as opposed to the real Hanna, an overweight pariah, isn't it?

Look, I liked the film and I'm not going to spend my time writing a thorough review and synopsis.  The other reviewers on this board can do that for you.  What I AM going to write is this:  What kind of message is this film trying to convey?!  (ESPECIALLY at the end during the credits!  Does this not disturb anyone?)

Sure, the film was funny and light-hearted, and maybe even tugged at the heartstrings at some moments.  But the bottom line is that the film is somehow JUSTIFYING plastic surgery and altering who you were naturally made to be in a nation where plastic surgery is already as common as McDonald's.  If you don't believe that, ask someone who has lived in Korea or better yet a Korean themselves and they will tell you in far better detail just how common plastic surgery is there.

Let's make one thing clear clear: I am not against a film promoting woman accepting themselves for who they are, coming to grips with their body-image and learning to love themselves.  What I AM against is a film promoting the idea that you are somehow unlovable or a reject in society because you are obese, or even somehow ""chubby"" or ""slightly overweight.""
And clearly, this is the case in Korea and is only proven more so by this film.

Was the goal of the filmmakers to discourage plastic surgery as a way of ""improving your life,"" or encourage it as another means to ""finding your true self and learning to love yourself"" (once you're skinny, of course.  Before that, you're screwed.)

All I can say is I got one message from this film: If you're somehow overweight, you will never be loved and find true happiness in this life.  Sure that may hold some truth in Western society where we seem to have an anorexic standard of beauty, but by and large... is this what we want our daughters and young women to believe?

Woman should love themselves for who they really are, and the film does a poor, poor job in trying to convey this, because in the end if Hanna had become ""fat"" again... well, that would have been a different story, wouldn't it?

3 Stars because it was a well executed, funny, and enjoyable film.  It never dragged, but it didn't sit well with my conscience in the end.  And I thought American girls had it bad... man.

And no, I am not obese or overweight.",1204848000,17,3162,4.42560553633218
2829473,5,B000Q5L9N6,"I watched this film on a Singapore Airlines international flight. I was travelling with a teenager and urged her to watch it too.  It was her first foreign language film and she loved it!  At a couple of points in the movie she even shed a tear.  She forgot all about the fact she was reading subtitles as the movie carried her away.  On the remainder of our trip she was humming and singing the song ""Maria"" which has now been recorded and released in English by the American singer Blondie. When I returned to Korea this month I had my Korean host sing Maria at a Karoke bar we went to. The movie and song were huge successes in Korea.  I thought it was a great light hearted film I would willingly watch again.",1193270400,6,713,4.2518518518518515
2829474,5,B000Q5L9N6,"Ive always loved Korean movies - they have a very refreshing theme. This movie is wonderfully good - the best movie Ive watched this year so far!

Its about an overweight girl who had to loose weight just to get the attention - from the person she loves and for her career.

Of course, this fairy tale comedy turns out beautifully as expected, and there were many moments to shed tears where you can really feel for the girl in her journey of accepting herself from both before and after surgery.

With funny moments in between, this movie is a good movie to watch to inspire and be inspired, whether on a good or bad day.

2829499,5,B000Q5L9N6,"This is very funny movie about Hana, a morbidly fat woman, who works as a phone sex operator and as a ghost singer for a mediocre lip syncing Korean pop star. When she is humiliated in front of the man she has crush on she enters into a year long regimen of radical plastic surgery and physical conditioning emerging from it as total knockout. She  adopts the name Jenny for her new persona and sets out to get revenge and win her man.  It is based on the Japanese manga Kanna's Big Success!

It stars Kim Ah Joong, a gifted Korean comedienne and actress, as Hana/Jenny. She is funny and beautiful and is perfectly suited to this role.  She is also a terrific singer and performed all of the songs in the movie sung by her characters.  This movie was a huge commercial and critical success. It was the third highest grossing film in Korea in 2006 and netted her three best actress awards from major Korean award granting bodies as well as many more nominations.  It has remained popular to this day, continues to have impressive DVD sales, and is available to stream from any of the major Korean streaming services including DramaFever, Viki, KissAsian, etc. If there is any Korean comedy that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath with My Sassy Girl this is it.

There is also a soundtrack CD available.

Kim Ah Joong has more than a dozen movies and dramas to her credit, the next most famous is the very funny 2012 film comedy Watcha Wearin? (AKA My PS Partner).  I first encountered her in 200 Pounds Beauty and liked her so well that I have since tracked down and watched all of her work that is available in the US.

Does it sound like I think that Kim Ah Joong is absolutely fabulous?  I hope so, because I absolutely do.",1476835200,,1734,4.421383647798742

Even though she took the easy way out of the weight loss in the end she realized that she had always been beautiful. Thats the message and words a lot of women don't hear.

Hanna goes to Jenny and in the process loses herself, although not her gift of voice and song.

1. Fat girl is a great person
2. She lives a difficult and unhappy existence because she is not outwardly beautiful
3. She has plastic surgery and now looks like a super model
4. Every man becomes a fumbling idiot and caveman and she can now get anything she wants
5. She has a great life and lives happily ever after

The moral of the story is if you have some imperfections fix them with surgery/money and you will be happy. Korean society at its ugliest low point in my opinion.",1446249600,4,521,4.262626262626263

There are some details of the story, some claimed to be depressing.  Yes, it does, but this is because there is some truth behind them.
Especially,  for those whom relate to low self esteem or face the struggles when a society weighs your personality based on how you look.  This is the skill and talent of comedy, to take those painful and wrongful truths and tack on the hilarity of the situation.  From beginning to end you will experience a range of emotions, from feeling creepy, inspired, cry, laugh, enlightened, teary, laughing holding your belly, and then crying again.

I gave this film a 4/5 because there were some wrong doers in this film I had hoped gotten what they deserved, but did not.  -at least to my satisfaction.",1411171200,,897,4.5

2829606,4,B000Q5L9N6,"In 200 POUNDS BEAUTY, Ah-Jung Kim begins as an obese ""hidden"" singer to a beautiful but untalented singer. Kim as Hanna has a life full of heartbreak: she is grossly overweight, bucktoothed, has a father with Alzheimers, and secretly in love with her producer, the only man who is even remotely kind to her. Matters become so bad that Hanna considers suicide but wisely changes her mind. Instead she blackmails a plastic surgeon into performing a head to foot plastic surgery so that she emerges as Jenny, a drop-dead gorgeous model type who sings as well as did Hanna. This film is a sentimental throwback to much earlier ones that celebrate victory over personal trauma. Hanna/Jenny at first is thrilled with being eye candy that is until she learns that inner beauty is as least as important as the outer variety. Further her producer rather preferred the Hanna version. Jenny clearly loves him even as he struggles to learn the same lessons as she does. The climax at the end when she acknowledges her confused father is truly tearful. Ah-Jung Kim performs her own songs and her rendition of ""Maria Ave Maria"" is breathtaking. 200 POUNDS BEAUTY does not pretend to suggest that it is more than what it is but it does show that for Hanna/Jenny inner peace is often more likely to be achieved if only we could peer inward to see who and what we are.",1397779200,,1351,4.656903765690377

It's a very relatable story about finding out how to love yourself as you've been born and not as some unrealistic ideal that is put out there for us. It also deals with regret one might have after changing their looks in order to fit that ideal. It was a good story.

2829648,1,B000Q5L9N6,"Spoiler Alert: This review contains detailed descriptions of the plot.

This movie is NOT FUNNY. I would have given up on it after the first 30 minutes, but I was already planning this review, so I stuck it out in order to write an informed review. The movie seemed interminable.

The woman, Hannah, is a singer, and she has a large body. She sings for a petite woman, Ammy, who is pretty but untalented and lip-synchs on stage while Hannah does the real singing backstage. The male lead is the music producer, on whom Hannah has a big crush. Unfortunately, one day Hannah finds out that he is just using her. Despondent, she tries to commit suicide.

She ends up getting interrupted by a phone call from one of her phone sex clients who happens to be a plastic surgeon. She tapes him, blackmails him, and gets him to perform dangerous plastic surgery on her to make her look thin and pretty.

Inexplicably, Hannah is STILL in love with the guy even though she had found out what a jerk he is.

Hannah is also a jerk. She is supposedly a nice person, but she is a total jerk to her sweet little dog, which really says more about her character than anything else. Later in the film, she's a complete jerk to her own father, who is elderly and senile and perfectly nice.

Hannah's best friend is also a shallow jerk. She is truly cruel in her comments to Hannah. I truly can't understand why Hannah is even friends with her in the first place.

Ammy is a shallow, selfish jerk as well. She's a snotty, snobby, jealous, vindictive person. The plastic surgeon is a shallow, selfish jerk. Hannah's spiritual mentor (or whatever, from the first scene) is also a jerk. The guy's brother is sort of ok, but not really, and the guys' father is probably the biggest jerk of all. Really, the only two characters who are nice are Hannah's father and Hannah's dog, both of whom she treats like dirt, as I already mentioned.

There isn't a single main character who is not a jerk, nor is there any actually funny dialogue. Seriously, everyone in the movie is a jerk, and the whole movie just sort of revolves around the jerky idea that people with large bodies are ugly and worthless, even though it seemed to me from the description that it was going to be something of the opposite. The ""funny"" parts are things like Hannah being so big that she falls through the floor of the stage, Hannah being so big that when she tries to bow to the mentor guy, her butt hits the wall behind her and launches her forward to fall and make a mess, and Hannah's father being so senile that when he dances with Hannah, he thinks he's dancing with Hannah's (presumably deceased) mother, and gropes Hannah's butt. If that's the kind of thing you find funny, you'll probably love the film. Otherwise, don't bother.

I hated it ""from head to toe...everything.""",1369008000,8,2828,4.497076023391813
2829649,5,B000Q5L9N6,This film is about an overweight talented singer who feels that a perfect body would solve everything. She finds out that is not the case and learns to accept herself for who she was and who she became. This movie had some poignant moments mixed in with the comedic ones. This is a honest romcom.

2829652,5,B000Q5L9N6,"Really loved watching this movie. I was surprised at how well done it actually was, with the description I had actually avoided watching it for a while. Kim Ah Joong plays Hana, an ""ugly, overweight"" woman who is only valued for her voice. She does not only phone sex calls but also is the voice for a beautiful, thin pop star.  She is pretty content with that life until she accidentally overhears the pop star and the producer (who Hana has a crush on) talking about her and how she is only a voice.

Utterly devastated by hearing the man she loves say that she tries to kill herself--and then gets another idea.

One of her phone sex clients is a plastic surgeon. She blackmails him into helping her and she becomes the beautiful Jenny.

Kim Ah Joong does such an amazing job of playing Jenny as someone who is completely uncomfortable in her new body.  That discomfort is more than a physical problem and is what drives the rest of the movie. Hana has to struggle with figuring out who she is now that she looks completely different and has taken up a new identity (yet has gone back to her old job).

The male main character is a great catalyst for all of the changes that Hana/Jenny undergo. He is also a sort of shades of gray character who also has some growing to do, but as a secondary character we don't see it as much.

Totally worth watching, it is funny and heartwarming.

Also, it has a fantastic cover of Blondie's Ave Maria as Jenny's anthem song. Kim Ah Joong does a great job with it.",1353283200,,1503,4.362007168458781
2829653,5,B000Q5L9N6,"200 Pounds Beauty tells the story of loveable ghost singer name Kang Hanna/Jenny, Kim Ah Joong. Hanna, while having a wonderful voice, lacks self esteem due to her weight. She than decides to opt for plastic surgery but finds out that no amount of plastic surgery can make her feel better about herself. 200 Pounds Beauty is also a movie that's lighthearted, witty and one that's very funny. While the movie is about plastic surgery, it's actually one that's making fun of it and society's obsession to beauty.

The blu ray comes in a very nice digipak style casing that's very similar to 300 the Complete blu ray book packaging except the blu ray is on the left side while the book is on the right. The booklet itself is just that, a very nice booklet that contains just pictures from the movie. The blu ray is in 1080P while the audio is in 5.1 DTS (48kHz/24-bit). The extras include behind the scenes and interviews. However, there's no English subs and it's not in 1080P but DVD quality. However, according to the site I bought this blu ray from, this blu ray is only region A and not region ALL like it's listed on Amazon. So you might want to know about the return policies as this might not play on all blu ray players. The back of the blu ray doesn't list the region so I can't help you here either. Just know that region A is only for the Americas (not including French Guiana), Korea, Japan and South East Asia (including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan).

Upgrading from DVD to blu ray was a no brainer for me as this is one of my favorite movie and it continues to make me laugh no matter how many times I've watched it and I've had the DVD since 2007. Kim Ah Joong is also one of my favorite actress and she's great in Sign and Accidental Couple. The blu ray is a huge upgrade from the DVD as the picture quality is a lot cleaner, I'm not an audio/movie phile so I don't pay too close attention to see if there's pixelation or anything like that. I just look to see how much cleaner it is compared to the original and from what I can see, it's a lot cleaner. The other difference is the screen is not as narrow as the DVD, which was to be expected. However, I didn't realize how wide the DVD version was until I popped in the blu ray.",1340496000,2,2243,4.262910798122066
2829654,5,B000Q5L9N6,"Warning: This DVD disc is not region 1, so you'll probably need either a player that can read all regions (ex. blu-ray) or use your computer to watch.  You can also see this movie for free now online at a lot of places, but if you like it you'll probably want to own it. I'd buy it here because foreign import DVDs usually cost a lot more for shipping and handling.

This is one of my favorite movies of all time! The premise is simple and borrowed, but comes off fresh because it takes a couple old stories and puts a new angle on it.  It's like a prince and pauper story with a popstar instead of prince.  It's like a cinderella story with evil corporation instead of evil family.  It's like an ugly duckling tale with plastic surgery instead of a swan.  The whole mix is set to some funky Kpop music and adds some touching realistic drama.

Hanna is a 200lb woman with a gorgeous heart and beautiful voice. Unfortunately, no one seems to appreciate this. So, she transforms herself in a desperate act and goes through head to toe surgery.  This changes her life, but in ways totally unexpected.  Suddenly, she realizes that maybe she just didn't value what was inside because of what others told her about her outside. Maybe all she really needed was some confidence all along?",1333843200,12,1280,4.459227467811159

The lead character breaks into tears at least every ten minutes.  Why so much crying?  It gets sickening.  They call it a romantic comedy, but there was no comedy.  It's just sappy.
 The lead actress, Ah-jung Kim, is very good.  It's too bad she's called upon to cry so much.  After she's gone through her ""transformation"", she's also drop-dead gorgeous.  The lead male character was an annoying twerp.  His actions, which often contradict each other, are never explained. Jin-mo Ju was okay at playing the role.",1525737600,,631,4.895238095238096
