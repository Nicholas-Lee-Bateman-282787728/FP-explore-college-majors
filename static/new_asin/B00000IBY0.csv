Some of the humour has dated a little.  But I loved all the 70s footage - it was great revisiting the clothes, hairstyles and attitudes of that time.",1433548800,,301,4.155172413793103
7909753,4,B00000IBY0,"This is a thoroughly entertaining and funny film.
My rating is for the program content only however.
The video quality is very poor - it looks like it was copied off-air with poor reception.",1279238400,,190,4.617647058823529
7909754,5,B00000IBY0,"Mark Lewis' Wonderful World of Dogs is a whimsical look at life from the dogs' and their owners' viewpoints.  It is funny and clever.  Being shot in Mossman (Sydney) Ausgralia is a plus as one gets to sample a bit of life down under.

Be sure to watch for the shower scene and the young lady whose dog likes to dress up, both of them were suberb.  Of course I am biased as she was my daughter and we lived in Sydney when the film was produced.",1253404800,,443,4.057471264367816
7909755,5,B00000IBY0,"This is the only dogs-on-TV thing my own dog ever enjoyed. And if you love dogs, you will too! It's hilarious, and it made me cry. It made me believe that Chihuahuas have fascinating interior lives. This is the best dog documentary ever made.",1190592000,2,242,4.5227272727272725
7909756,5,B00000IBY0,"This is a movie you'll never forget....I watched it at a film festival in Dallas when it was first released and am buying a copy for my own, having never forgotten the wonderful time I had watching The Wonderful World of Dogs!  Lewis combines an Australian sense of humour with an eye-opening awareness of intricacies of pet life you won't find on any other film.  This would make a FANTASTIC GIFT for anyone you know who owns -- and loves -- a dog of any sort.  FUN, FUN, FUN, and informative.  You'll never look at pets the same again.",1039219200,10,537,4.393939393939394
