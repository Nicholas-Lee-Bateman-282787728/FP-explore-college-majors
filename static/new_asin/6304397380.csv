7871337,3,6304397380,"Like the other reviews here, I found the color photography of the Highlands to be beautiful (which made it all the more glaring when the film cuts to dialogue scenes obviously filmed on sound stages) but the technicalities of filmmaking in the 40's made this common practice.  David Niven looks very uncomfortable in a blonde wig and spouting some fairly silly dialogue.  Jack Hawkins and Finlay Currie are both very good but are sorely missed when their brief scenes are over.  Margaret Leighton as Flora is very beautiful. I am more used to her as an older character actress so it's nice to see her presented this way.  I have read that the movie was cut after first previews by over 20 minutes. I wonder if this accounts for the disjointedness of it all, especially the missing Battle of Culloden.  Because the Culloden Battle (actually presented in only a short scene of the destruction after the battle has been lost)  happens about halfway through the movie, it makes for a very long second half.",1374105600,2,1002,4.7298850574712645
7871338,3,6304397380,"I would have given this film a higher rating except for ONE glaring omission: there was no climactic Battle of Culloden.  Only a short melodramatic aftermath.  That director Anthony Kimmins, let alone the film producers, would omit the one battle that continues to haunt the Scottish psyche some 260 years later borders on criminal.  That said, the second unit shots of highland Scotland (Glen Coe, Glenfinnan, Eilean Donan Castle, Isle of Skye, & Kyle of Lochalsh, to name a few) are all first-rate.  Also, the scenes of Jacobite highlanders tramping across the highlands evoke Scottish memories (mostly afore-mentioned highlander) of wishing they should have marched on to London after the victory at York to dictate terms to the Hanoverians.
  This movie is a great example of my belief that there are no bad film ideas.  Only 'less than stellar' executions of said ideas.  (See the film ""Speed"".)",1303516800,3,900,5.074829931972789
7871339,5,6304397380,"This video tells the story of two very different legendary figures in British history, one a man I thought I knew and one I knew little about.  First up is Richard the Lionheart, a much-esteemed, even revered king of the 12th century.  Legend describes a just, strong king who rivals Arthur in his greatness, a man who found glory and fame in the Third Crusades with his unprecedented courage and military genius, and a king who returned home to save the country from his unscrupulous usurper of a brother John.  History shows a darker side to good King Richard, however.  I was surprised to learn that Richard was basically a Frenchman, having been raised in France by his mother Catherine of Acquitaine; he did not even speak English.  When he secured the throne, he taxed the country into poverty in order to fund his own ambitions - namely, the Crusades.  Assuredly brave, he was not always just, especially against his enemies.  His insult of Leopold of Austria after one battle came back to bite him when he was kidnapped by the Duke's men on his return home.  Back in England, he forgave his brother John and quickly set about taxing the people to pay off his ransom to the Duke.  He died a heroic if rather foolish death, then did the country he ruled no favor by leaving the kingdom to his worthless brother John.

The next video tells the story of Charles Edward Stuart, best known as Bonnie Prince Charlie.  His attempt to reestablish the Stuart Dynasty would end rather horribly at the famous battle of Culloden in April 1746.  James II had been deposed by Parliament in 1689; decades later in Rome, his grandson Prince Charlie was obsessed with recapturing the throne for the Stuarts.  When France declared war on England in 1740, he saw his chance, but he wasted five years in Versailles trying to get the backing of King Louis.  In 1745, he set foot on Scottish soil for the first time and found an instant army in the Highland Clans.  He and his men enjoyed great early success, advancing to within 130 miles of London.  Against Charlie's vehement objections, the Clans decided to fall back when they may well have been able to take the panic-stricken English capital.  Instead, they found themselves pursued back to the Highlands by a fierce army of redcoats who finally caught up with them at Culloden Moor.  While Charlie escaped (with the help of incredibly loyal Scots such as Flora McDonald) to look back on his former, short-lived glories, the Highland Scots were made to pay dearly for their rebellion.  Still, Bonnie Prince Charlie remains a revered figure in Scotland, a nostalgic reminder of the past glory of the Highland Clans.",1090627200,3,2656,4.72234273318872
7871340,3,6304397380,"Despite the subject matter I found this movie to be quite dull.  This is unfortunate as the story of the '45 Rebellion is anything but that!  I think the casting of David Niven as the Prince was a bad choice.  While he tries to put energy into the role, Niven is just too English!  Also, from what we know of the Prince he was not such an inspiring figure.  Like most of the Stewarts he tended to be moody, headstrong and could come across as detached and arrogant.  He was also quite foriegn in his outlook and knew little about Scotland other than what members of the exiled Stewart Court in France and Italy divulged to him.
The film itself is impressive visually.  But the story progresses slowly and is more atmosphereic.  Jack Hawkins plays well as Lord Murrary, the leading Jacobite general.  The clashes between him and the Prince over strategy are well portrayed in the movie.  The battle of Prestonppans is well done.  I wish they could have done the same for rest of the battles. Culloden is not even shown!  The movie then drags considerable as we trace the progress of the Young Pretenders flight from Scotland.  This part of the movie seems too long drawn out.  Throughout the Prince is given almost saintly treatment.  His relationship with Flora Macdonald is also too good to be true.  For an English movie its surprising how the Bonnie prince is so favorably portrayed.  The film willingly enters into all the Scottish fantasy and lore about him.  Again, a pretty film, but too slow and stately.",1069977600,11,1512,4.620300751879699
7871341,3,6304397380,"This English version of Charles Stuart's attempt to seize the British crown from the House of Hannover, is disjointed and relatively unexciting. The crucial Battle of Culloden Moor is talked about, but not depicted. David Niven, as the Young Pretender, is very sincere, and does a good job, but he is betrayed by the script and the editing. The highlight of the film are the Scottish Highlands themselves. The color photography is breath taking. A word of caution on the VHS tape. The edition available is issued by Republic Pictures of Canada. It is in the EP mode, and the audio is TERRIBLE. One literally has to turn the volume to Max to hear anything.",1033430400,14,655,4.7043478260869565
