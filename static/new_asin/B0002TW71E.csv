8031878,5,B0002TW71E,I just love Mr. Henry!  He teaches valuable lessons in a very fun and entertaining way- kids of all ages AND adults are entertained and encouraged and reminded what is important.,1158278400,,178,4.741935483870968
8031879,1,B0002TW71E,"Video is clealy over heads of my 5 and 3 yr old.  I would not purchase this for any child under 8-10yrs...and even then, doubtful.  All conversation is spoken very fast and not with a child expressions, etc (ie Blue's Clues or other more typical child programming give verbal/non verbal expressions that are typical for children and good for them to model, etc).  The examples are almost for 5-6 grade level.  The choice of words, use of sarcastic questions, etc are also above them.  The visitor and band members look/act and their expressions (verbal and non verbal) more like disgruntled workers than talent in a childs program.  The video jumps without a consistent medium to ensure all know how each part relates to the other.

I would return if I could...The video DOES have an advertisement about ANOTHER video on fear that has the voices of Tim Conway and Vicky Lawrence....I will look for it at my semi-local Christian store...good luck!!",1125878400,2,947,4.84472049689441
