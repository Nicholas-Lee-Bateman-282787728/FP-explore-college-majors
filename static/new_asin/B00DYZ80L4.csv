5879724,5,B00DYZ80L4,Exactly what I wanted! A very good exercise for all ages. A total body work out without putting pressure on bones and joints.,1435968000,3,125,4.478260869565218
5879725,5,B00DYZ80L4,Highly recommend for just about everybody!,1430179200,4,42,6.166666666666667
5879726,4,B00DYZ80L4,"It was worth spending lots of time reading reviews to choose my very first ""stretch"" video. As a beginner, it is relatively easy to follow, narrator's voice is pleasant, pace is perfect and the scenery adds to the relaxing feel as you move through the stretches.",1428364800,13,262,4.717391304347826
5879727,5,B00DYZ80L4,"Great explanations for each stretch.  Slow but not too slow pace.  The instructor has a calming voice. No annoying, intrusive background music.

This is primarily aimed at those new to stretching -- e.g. couch potatoes -- and to the elderly.  I am in the former camp and see this as a great way to get started.  For those of you in either category, I'd recommend it.",1410393600,16,366,4.484848484848484
5879728,5,B00DYZ80L4,This dvd is simple and easy to understand her instructions My dvd came on time and in perfect condition.. You won.t be disappointing.,1398988800,9,133,4.826086956521739
5879729,4,B00DYZ80L4,"It does the job for a quick stretch when I don't have time to devote to longer sessions.  It easy enough to follow, queing is good.",1384819200,10,131,4.038461538461538
5879737,5,B00DYZ80L4,Stretching has become increasingly important as I age. This DVD is easy to follow and I enjoy doing it.,1454544000,,103,4.473684210526316
5879738,5,B00DYZ80L4,"This is my favorite work out video of all time. This is my second time buying it because I wore out the old one after 10 years of use. The moves are simple to follow. The setting is very nice. I mostly use this video as a PM stretch but the Power Stretch and Daily Stretch just make me feel good. I do a lot of gym classes, sports with young kids, and moving around and these videos just make my body feel balanced.",1453248000,6,415,3.9523809523809526
5879739,4,B00DYZ80L4,"The PM segment is one of my personal favorites. I am a beginner level yoga practitioner and love the pace and instruction of this dvd. Pretty scenic settings and the voice over is non intrusive and not too chatty.
Don't use the Conditioning dvd as much - requires extensive use of a resistance band/towel

The AM-PM dvd developed a crack and I rushed right out and purchased another copy.",1453075200,4,388,4.6231884057971016
5879740,5,B00DYZ80L4,she does a through job at touching each part of the body. im only 42 and its obvious shes probably in her 50's and her body is toned and fit.  she does very well with all of her stretches. if this is all you do everyday and eat right you will see some results.  i couldn't do half of what she was doing without struggling.,1452902400,7,322,3.9384615384615387
5879741,5,B00DYZ80L4,Good dvd,1452297600,,8,3.5
5879742,5,B00DYZ80L4,"I love this stretch/exercise DVD. I use it every day and it has helped with my flexibility, lowered stress and made me physically stronger. The narrator has a soothing voice and uses good ques to make the movements easy to follow and most effective. The DVD incorporates relaxing background music and beautiful scenery that is soothing. The stretches and exercises are excellent. There are 2 DVDs with 4 different stretch programs to keep exercise varied and interesting. This is by far my favorite exercise video.",1450742400,7,514,5.0588235294117645
5879743,3,B00DYZ80L4,Havent tried it yet but how could you go wrong,1445817600,,46,3.7
5879744,1,B00DYZ80L4,"This is for the Daily Stretch Conditioning dvd (I've yet to watch the other dvd in the set.) Planks, pushups, and lunges are NOT stretches. Very disappointed in this dvd. I'm just hoping that the other dvd is about stretching, not strengthening. How about truth in titles?",1445817600,6,272,4.808510638297872
5879745,5,B00DYZ80L4,I love this stretch series.,1443571200,,27,4.6
5879746,5,B00DYZ80L4,"As a former muscular therapist the hardest thing for me was to get clients to do their own self care and STRETCH. I found this DVD by Madeleine Lewis to be the 'best' program for them (and myself). The second DVD provides a more advanced routine when the AM/PM program gets too easy.  Try it, use it, and after a month pay attention to how much better you feel. Keep a simple journal because we forget how much parts of our body were hurting.

Do both AM and PM (at any time of the day, it does NOT have to always be the 'correct' time of day)!!! And don't do your own version of the program because you will skip the stretches that you need the most!",1440547200,21,651,4.118110236220472
8599303,3,B00DYZ80L4,Be careful.  Amazon shows that often people purchase this DVD along with AM&PM Stretch.  DO NOT PURCHASE AS A BUNDLE because the AM & PM Stretch DVD is the second DVD in this 2 DVD set.,1520899200,2,185,4.111111111111111
8599304,5,B00DYZ80L4,The best stretching/yoga routine I have found to date. Absolutely love it!!,1507161600,,75,5.333333333333333
8599305,5,B00DYZ80L4,Madeleine Lewis has such a soothing voice as she instructs on the routine. Love her stretching DVDs.,1501718400,,100,4.9411764705882355
8599306,5,B00DYZ80L4,One of my favorite stretching tapes. Calm and relaxing,1501459200,,54,5.111111111111111
8599307,3,B00DYZ80L4,"This program starts right off without much of a warm-up.  The outdoor setting is nice and there is no distracting background music.  At least half of the work takes place on the floor, however, and some of it was beyond me as a senior.  Would probably be fine for a younger person in good shape.",1493510400,4,295,4.327272727272727
