Course 1

The ten sections of Course 1 are thoroughly covered, and are presented in a very logical and organized manner.  I've always been impressed with how Dr. Yang and his director David Silver lay out the material; with content, order and presentation always being top notch.

While covering the history of Qigong, Dr. Yang talks about how Qigong has been a part of Chinese Culture for four thousand years, in contrast to the few number of years that it has been studied in the United States.  The irony of this is that as more nations and peoples become aware of Qigong, they become instrumental in helping to fund research to prove or disprove the claims made in regards to Qigong.

The west tends to trust that which can be measured, seen and touched.  Chinese culture tends to accept more of those things that are felt.  I am reminded of the scene in ""Enter the Dragon"", where Bruce Lee has just engaged in some sparring with his student in order to impart some martial arts knowledge.  When Bruce asks him for his take on the sparring they just shared, his student scratches his chin, rolls his eyes towards the sky and says ""Hmmm, let me think.""  To which Bruce Lee responds by smacking the student on the top of his head and admonishing him with ""Don't think, feel!

Dr. Yang discusses how when the body feels pain, even if there is no visible sign of a problem, from the Chinese Medicine approach, the body knows there is a problem and is calling out for help.  Therefore, one should be sensitive to what one feels.

Dr. Yang gives valid examples of how Western medicine responds to pain by prescribing pain pills, where eastern medicine tries to discover the cause of the pain, which is usually caused by some type of Qi imbalance.  The benefit of using Qigong and acupuncture techniques during surgery is clearly explained by Dr. Yang.

When a patient is put into a coma, the normal procedure during serious surgery in the west, the pain is blocked but so are all other functions.  When acupuncture is used, the patient can be aware, awake and talking to the doctor, while the pain is being blocked through the use of acupuncture needles and an understanding of the Qi flow in the body.

Dr. Yang points out that in Western medicine, we wait until ""it happens"" and then try to find a cure.  In Chinese Medicine, the focus is on prevention of disease, for which Qigong is admirably suited.

Additionally, Medical Qigong is the oldest use of Qigong in China, going back four thousand years.  Dr. Yang clearly presents the differences between the Western and the Chinese approaches to healing.  Where the Western side views the mind and the body being connected through nerves, the Chinese view is that the mind and body are connected through Qi.

Although they are essentially the same, one is from a physical structure point of view and the other is from an energy point of view.  When we build our Qi, our nerves become more sensitive, allowing us to have more feeling.

A very clear, logical and scientific explanation is provided by Dr. Yang for the processes concerning sending the Qi to the outer skin and sending the Qi to the bone marrow.  Many students of Qigong have read about these concepts, but Dr. Yang's explanation of how the process works and what steps are required to achieve these results go far beyond the information found in other books on Qigong.

Course 2

If you've ever bought books on Qigong and felt that the information inside was difficult to comprehend and retain, then watching this DVD will give a viewer a quickly assimilated understanding of the concepts, which will enhance and further one's understanding when rereading the original book that was proving to be tedious the first time through.  This is particularly true in the case of Course 2, which presents material that is perhaps a wee bit more difficult in nature than what is presented in Course 1.

Throughout his explanations, Dr. Yang refers to the differences in Chinese and Western approaches to healing, which provides the viewer a necessary standard and base from which to compare the provided information.  Neither approach is necessarily wrong, and in reality, Western and Chinese Medicine both have their times and circumstances during which they excel.  After all, it is a Yin Yang Symbol, and although Chinese and Western approaches appear to be ""opposites"", they both have something to offer and are both parts of the whole.

Dr. Yang explains how Western Medicine divides the upper and lower body by the physical center of gravity as well as the physical appearance, whereas Chinese Medicine divides the upper and lower body from the perspective of energy.  Just as in Western Medicine the organs of the body exist physically, where in Chinese Medicine there are organs that cannot be seen, but the effects of these organs can be felt, as in the Triple Burner.

I've read every book that Dr. Yang has written, yet I was amazed by how much more I learned while watching this DVD.  Somehow, hearing the info directly from Dr. Yang, made it that much more alive.  The day this DVD arrived on my doorstep, I found myself unable to turn it off in order to carry out the necessary chores for the day.

In Conclusion

Many books have been released in English on the subjects of Qi and Qigong.  The majority are basically straight translations from original Chinese manuscripts.  Even native Chinese speakers are at times guilty of merely translating some of these works, yet omitting true meanings of the phrases.

Unless a person understands the concepts of Taijiquan, the Chinese language, the nuances of the language, as well as the differences between  modern and classic Chinese language, it is almost impossible to do anything more than just a straight translation, which even then would be subject to error.

Although this DVD is not necessarily a ""translation"" of a specific document, it is certainly a result of the many years that Dr. Yang has spent reading, practicing, translating, teaching and pondering the various historical documents that form the foundation of Qigong.

Dr. Yang's inquiring mind and scientific approach, combined with his experiences and background in the martial arts, make him one of the few people that can create a DVD like this one, in which not only is the classic material presented, but it is combined with clear explanations that demonstrate a true and accurate grasp of the subject.  When Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming chose to leave his former career to pursue his studies and teaching of Martial Arts, we all received a great blessing, evidenced by the large volume of excellent material that he has produced over the years.

I love the way Dr. Yang will pose questions as he is making his presentation.  Many times I have heard Dr. Yang through speech or written words, challenge his readers/viewers to ponder the concepts and try to come up with questions that will help to clarify one's understanding.  While watching his two man Taijiquan Fighting Set DVD, I recall Dr. Yang prodding the viewer to try and imagine what the next move would be in the series, rather than watching what the next move would be without any attempt at trying to come up with the answer on his or her own.  I believe that his approach, always questioning, always reexamining and pondering, is one of the key's to his success as a student and as a teacher (hopefully, a teacher is always a student at heart).

I've always had difficulty in being able to attend the seminars by Dr. Yang, so having access to this DVD has helped to fill that void.  As is true of many of his publications, I would recommend this DVD for practitioners of any level in any school of martial arts or qigong, as well as newcomers.",1158364800,117,8526,4.757700205338809

2647820,5,B000HXDM82,"I've had a decent amount of teaching in qigong through my 15 years of martial arts training.  I've also read alot of books.  So I wasn't sure if I should get it but other reviews made me give it a shot.  He makes everything clear and easy to understand so anyone, even without any prior knowledge, could understand what qigong is and how it works using examples that anyone can relate to, like electricity powering a fan.  It is long.  2 courses each 2 hours long.  And with my knowledge I did get a little anxious for him to wrap up by the time it was over.  (I haven't been  in a classroom in 10 years, what do you expect?)  But I was surprised at how much I got from ""what is qigong""  Everything Dr Yang puts out is top quality and leaves nothing to be desired.  If I ever get the chance to meet him I am going to thank him personally for everything he's done and is doing for Chinese martial arts.",1361059200,5,901,4.120689655172414
2647821,5,B000HXDM82,"There are no other sources like those from Dr. Yang.
I teach Qigong and Taiji and I have many of Dr. Yangs books which I recommend highly. The books are often a little difficult to read but in these DVDs everything is clear, organized and sequential. Start with DVD 1 & 2 when you want more just keep going! Dr. Yang has so much knowledge it is quite amazing.

When I started reading his books about 12 years ago I found him a little hard to get into. After watching 7 or 8 DVDs I find him kind of charming, in other words, he grows on you. After watching so much of his stuff, I feel like I actually know him as one of my teachers, even though I have never met him. All of his DVDs are like attending a personal workshop/seminar, and you can watch them over and over!

The truth is, he knows this stuff inside and out, from scientific to spiritual. Another truism is this... No one else will give you as much information, period.",1358640000,2,930,4.189944134078212
2647822,5,B000HXDM82,"Dr. Yang's scientific training is on full display in this DVD where he provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of chi/qi and gives his very well-considered theories on how chi functions from a western scientific perspective.  His discussions of electric conductance and the various tissues of the body is fascinating, though those without a scientific background may have to work some to understand things like Ohm's Law, etc.  His discussion of bones and the secondary meridians was very useful and not something that I have seen so thoroughly explored in many other qigong works.

I hesitated for some time to purchase this introductory DVD simply because is was, well, introductory.  But it turned out to be an excellent purchase.",1356739200,5,742,5.158333333333333

2647824,1,B000HXDM82,"He may have a point, but he won't get to it any time soon.  I've been watching the lecture for an hour and there is not a single idea that follows through.

2647825,5,B000HXDM82,"Dr. Yang does a superb job in this video. It looks like there are plenty of people who agree and have offered much more detail than I have time for, but I just wanted to back the high ratings further because of the high knowledge/entertainment value. If you have an interest in history and how things work, Dr. Yang does not disappoint. Very sharp guy.",1328140800,,352,4.430769230769231
2647826,5,B000HXDM82,Understanding Qigong by Dr. Yang. I can't express what a great teacher this man is. He has an understanding of and a way to teach Qigong that is simpler to understand. I have never been disappointed with any of his books and I would recommend this to anyone.  Jimmie,1321315200,,266,4.428571428571429
2647837,5,B000HXDM82,"I look at the topic as an outsider. I have been fascinated by Qigong but the topic is so complex and complicated that I could never understood what is left and what is right. These series of lectures not only filled the gap of knowledge but also opened my eyes.

What I appreciated the most is the way the material is presented. I am a westerner and I see and understand things as such; the instructor, most likely due to his long teaching experience, has been able to communicate these long lived studies and observation of human nature in an understandable way.

The two programs on the DVD are the basis of the whole series but would work very well by themselves as well. One word on the quality: these are not high tech DVDs. The camera is fixed on the instructor who uses a white board and some posters to instruct. No fancy stuff but only good material

Personally, I have not only watched the lessons but I tried to meditate on the points as much as I could. I know it has enriched me and enlighten me as well.  Now, I can tell I have a better understanding of Qigong. I highly recommend the program.",1306454400,4,1107,4.333333333333333

2647840,5,B000HXDM82,"Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming is truly one of the most gifted martial artists to-date and his depth of knowledge concerning martial arts is second to none. The principles discussed here are highly advanced and merely referring to Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming as a martial artist is limiting as he is a man of science and highly educated, as you'll see him relate Chi to electrical engineering principles and other deep concepts. Just to add, all of his videos show an enormous attention to detail so anything produced by him on DVD is always of the highest quality and recommended.

You'll need to get his complete 6-DVD set to make this a worthwhile purchase, but I believe you'll find these videos truly enlightening, opening your mind to ideas and thoughts not yet entertained.",1268438400,3,763,4.869230769230769
2647841,5,B000HXDM82,"I am a relative beginner to Qigong and it's healing capabilities.

I found this video difficult to understand at times but very informative none the less. I have purchased the authors Qigong for Arthritis. The qigong exercises really do help and make you feel better.

2647842,5,B000HXDM82,"As a student of spirituality through eclectic means, I hunt for differing aspects of various spiritual resevoirs of knowledge from various cultures.  Differing aspects of the same truth overlap yet each provide slightly more than simply one aspect alone..nuggets of understanding as a result.  In this material I expected to clear up for me the concept of Chi but ended up with more .. clearing up and tying together some aspects of Daoist subjects which were more or less esoteric to me.  The main subject is still Chi Gung.. but the foundations lecture is invaluable indeed.  Well worth the time.  I am referring to the series in totality.",1255910400,,641,4.898148148148148
2647843,5,B000HXDM82,"I thought this was the best purchase I have made off of Amazon. You will have read all the other, more detailed, responses so I won't repeat what's been said.

2647844,5,B000HXDM82,"My primary study is Taiji - and again, primarily alone. As I am unable to get to any sort of regular classes I rely on high quality books and DVDs to guide me. Books on Taiji and Qigong abound and there are many good Taiji DVDs out there but few really good ones on Qigong.

There are of course many DVDs which show Qigong forms. But there are few which talk about the theory of Qigong, particularly in terms that Westerners can understand.

Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming's DVD 1 on Understanding Qigong is such a DVD. He has a PhD in Mechanical Engineering and, as he says on the DVD, all his tertiary studies have been pure science oriented. He has applied that scientific rigour to his very deep understanding of traditional Chinese martial and Qigong arts in order to explain Qigong. He takes the 'feelings' oriented Taiji theory and uses linear Western logic, such as Ohm's law, to make it comprehensible to the layperson.

Having read and studied [intellectually] Qigong for many years, I was aware at the start of the DVD of many of the strands of his arguments, although I had no way to put those strands together. Impressively though, Dr. Yang took those strands and wove a whole cloth, starting from the fundamentals of Chinese Wuji, Taiji and Qigong theory and developing it all the way through to linking it into the physical Taiji form. This first DVD provides a simply excellent introduction to Qigong theory.

I have always been loathe to study Qigong on my own, as there was too much I didn't understand. How, for example, does the Tendon Washing Qigong relate to the Bone Marrow Qigong? What is their purpose? What physical effects do they have on the body? How does Taiji operate to create Yin and Yang from Wuji?  All of these questions and far, far more are answered on this first DVD.  If you're just starting your Qigong studies and don't understand the questions I've asked, don't worry, his explanations will lead to that understanding at the same time as he leads you to the answers.  On the strength of this DVD I will now commence Qigong exercises.

As a professionally qualified adult trainer I can also comment that Dr. Yang is an excellent teacher, once you get used to his, at times, strong accent. I had bought DVDs 1 and 2 of this series on spec. Halfway through the first [2.5hr] lesson of the two on this DVD I went and ordered the remainder of the series.

I strongly recommend this DVD.",1203811200,58,2414,4.582366589327147
2647845,5,B000HXDM82,A clear and scholarly presentation of the all different aspects of Qigong. I appreciate the fact that Dr. Yang is both a high level practitioner of this art and also a hard core scientist. Highly recommended!,1199577600,15,208,4.805555555555555
2647846,5,B000HXDM82,"I believe that the first lessons in life should always begin with in-depth teachings of the human body and its functions. We weren't born with manuals and therefore most of us don't have a clue as to the vital importance of proper mind/body care and maintenance. Like an automobile or a computer, both a very complex and unless you have an understanding on what happens under the bonnet, or inside the computer case, you need trained professionals to carry out routine services to ensure these instruments perform at their optimum. Should you not do this, you risk causing damage to your engine or your computer crashing. This is the exact scenario with our mind/body.

I believe Dr. Yang has very in-depth knowledge and experience with the human body. Within his DVD's he can show/educate anyone on the functions of our organs and the understanding of how our body works and the connection we have with earth and the universe. Learn what he teaches and you too can maintain an efficient mind/body to perform at your optimum all the time. Being alive is the greatest gift and we owe it to ourselves to ensure we can get the most out of everyday without feeling drained or being in a poor emotional state.

I strongly recommend Dr. Yang's Qigong DVD's to everyone and anyone.",1188518400,10,1274,4.7342342342342345

All of the information provided in each dvd is so important in developing a foundation upon which to build all future future Chi development and/or Martial Arts training.

The student will also find that these works are referenced as the source of ""further in-depth information"" in other of Dr. Yang's amazing works.

I think this knowledge is essential for anyone who would like to become very spiritual and open doors that lead to the beyond.  If you've seen the Matrix movie then it's something like that, but you must be persistent because this magic will not happen by trying it a couple of times.
