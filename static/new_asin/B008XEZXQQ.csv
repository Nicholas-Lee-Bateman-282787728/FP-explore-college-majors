8532113,5,B008XEZXQQ,I love this type of anime! Historic with a bit of supernatural mixed in. I love samurai tales! The clashing of blades. A very enjoyable anime to watch.,1454371200,,151,4.428571428571429

8532116,5,B008XEZXQQ,"I won't get into any gory details of the story; the synopsis can be found elsewhere.  Nor, can I say anything about the voice acting; since I watch subtitles.  But, an issue was raised about the 'quality' of the Blu-ray version.  Granted; I'm not so sure there's a huge different between BD and DVD myself, but I'm in the habit of purchasing BD versions.  There is quite a bit of the story that looks grainy; but for some reason, to me at least, it looks to be on purpose (these are past moments, flashbacks).  And, artistically, I enjoy it.  There are also moments of very crisp, clear, bright picture during other (present) story moments.

I was impressed with Bakumatsu; it visually reminded me of a combination of Basilisk (Gonzo) -- with the interesting acting troupe & sword powers, House of Five Leaves (Manglobe) -- with the artwork and characters, and Sword of the Stranger (Bones) -- with the samurai-ship.  It is some beautiful work by Sunrise (Code Gaess, My-HiME, etc).  Great story telling, action-packed with no dull mements.  Highly recommended.",1356393600,,1061,4.844444444444444
