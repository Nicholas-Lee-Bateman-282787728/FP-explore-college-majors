2245881,4,B0007VY5JE,"Rene Fleming, at this writing 56 years old and having publicized an impending retirement from the operatic stage, has in recent years been working through her signature roles one by one, saying goodbye to them. Several of these late-career revisits, from the Met and other theaters, have been released on DVD/Blu-ray. Her roles do not get more ""signature"" than Dvork's water sprite, Rusalka, which she has been singing for more than two decades. She was the inheritor of Gabriela Benackov as the world's standard-bearer in this role, and because the opera itself only made it to the Met in 1993, every Met run of the opera has been built around one or the other of them, with Fleming having the decided edge in performance tally. That situation will change when the new RUSALKA production debuts in a few seasons, after Fleming's time (the Latvian Kristine Opolais will take up the mantle). The present DVD was also the farewell to the lavish and pictorial Otto Schenk/Gnther Schneider-Siemssen production the Met has had all along, one which has made the rounds of other houses in North America and Europe.

Fleming previously appeared on a 2002 DVD of RUSALKA from the Paris Opera, a production directed by Robert Carsen and conducted by James Conlon. Fleming's singing inevitably had greater freedom and more consistently plush and silken tone throughout its range twelve years earlier than it would have in 2014. But the role remained a good one for her in 2014, and the top, where much of the music lives, still shimmers and blooms. Fleming is a technical marvel, so it is only a case of the better being the enemy of the good. Which DVD is to be preferred is probably a matter of taste in productions. Carsen, like most modern directors, responds more to the metaphorical possibilities of the opera's libretto, and his production, in modern dress, is more concerned with the theme of breakdown of communication and intimacy in relationships; it is not such a literal fairy tale. The Met's production may be the first ""literal fairy tale"" one to make it to DVD, and arch-traditionalists will rejoice in the redress. But Schneider-Siemssen's sets and Sylvia Strahammer's costumes do look their age, both in the sense of having a 1980s aesthetic and in the sense of having served through many years of use and warehousing. They were given the best possible spiffing-up for this final run, in mind of the Live in HD presentation on the calendar. Revival direction of the actors themselves betrays the Met's busy rehearsal conditions.

Mezzo Dolora Zajick, the witch Jezibaba, has been headlining productions at the Met for even longer than Fleming has, and is similarly experienced in her role. The two of them co-starred on the award-winning, now classic Mackerras/Decca set on CD. Zajick too has taken good care of her voice, and she has lost nothing at the top or the bottom, only the middle sounding hollowed from its condition in halcyon days. The other three principals are veterans themselves, although not yet so closely associated with this opera. Bass-baritone John Relyea's physical expression is limited by a monster-movie costume and set designs that sometimes have him popping up from a hole in the stage, but he is in good voice as a warmhearted Water Gnome. Emily Magee, an American soprano who has had an important career mostly in Europe and has been on many other DVDs (Eva in MEISTERSINGER on a Bayreuth release from as long ago as 1999), made an overdue Met debut as the viperous Foreign Princess. The most outstanding solo turn of all is by tenor Piotr Beczala, a house favorite in recent seasons, here scoring another triumph as the Prince. He may not have been in his very best voice on these dates, with a slight rasp to the tone, but this is first-class tenorizing nonetheless, powerful and pointed in emphatic declamations, sweetly lyrical elsewhere. He makes a most likable hero in spite of the character's fickleness. Among smaller roles, the baritone Vladimir Chmelo, a native of Slovakia, makes a lot of his words as an exceptional Gamekeeper.

Yannick Nzet-Sguin, not yet 40 at the time of this RUSALKA run, has only been conducting at the Met since the new CARMEN's debut in 2010. It says something for the power and brilliance of his performances of Italian, French, and now Czech repertoire that he is already at the top of many short lists as a potential successor to the theater's long-serving, increasingly enfeebled music director. This is a beautiful, exciting, and rather flashy reading of the score, rarely predictable or obvious in its shape. He follows Fleming dutifully as she savors and milks the famous ""Song to the Moon,"" but asserts himself elsewhere, for example, in the swaggering dance music of the second act. Whatever dainty movements are going on on the stage, he leaves little doubt, in the way the episode builds to its explosive, ecstatic climax, what it is that Rusalka cannot easily do that the Foreign Princess certainly can, and what Rusalka envies. His conducting and the playing of the Met Orchestra in response are among the disc's main attractions.

Susan Graham's on-the-quick interviews with four cast members and the conductor add little other than a suggestion of agreeable personalities and pleasant relationships.

While I personally prefer Fleming's prior DVD performance of this opera as a visual souvenir of her in this role, and I find the Paris stage production smarter and a good deal better directed in terms of nailing the moods down with specificity and getting the most from the actors, this one has much to recommend it as well. It seems little wonder that the opera is more popular than ever outside the Czech Republic in our own time. Whatever tack a particular production takes, this is an outsider's story, one that speaks to us in this time of surprising transformations fraught with possibility but also with risk.",1442016000,12,5905,4.9306532663316585
2245882,5,B0007VY5JE,"Non-opera folks don't get it, so I compare this to seeing a movie and wanting to see it again so bad, but it's never available again. I fell in love with this opera immediately when I saw it live in HD, then I saw the encore broadcast. I've since bought 3 other productions of Rusalka on DVD/blu ray, but none of them actually tell the story of Rusalka; ya see, there's the girl locked in the basement, the girl in the nursery, and the prostitute... That just sounds like a bad joke. I need my Rusalka to look like it's straight from the pages of an Arthur Rackham book. Luckily, my local opera presented a traditional Rusalka the following season so I somewhat got my fix; however, a lot of music was cut (most noticeably the ""kitchen boy and chef"" material). So to finally have Dvorak's masterfully written fairy tale fully realized in Otto Schenk's beautiful production with this dream cast -- this has me really jazzed!
I guess if I want this review to be useful, I need to include the following:
The costumes and sets are great. Think of Schenk's Ring and you're not far off. The lake scenes are pastoral yet murky. The kingdom is brighter, traditional palatial opulence. Renee Fleming is Rusalka, one of her signature roles. Love her or hate her, what else need I say but Renee in a signature role? She delivers everything you hope for and expect. Dolora Zajick is the sea witch Jezibaba. I'm pretty sure had I not been introduced to this opera with her in the role, this entire time I'd be walking around hoping to one day see her in it; it's perfect for her (I feel the same about her and Azucena). John Relyea's performance as the water gnome is nothing to complain about, but he gets lost in a cast that includes those first two in roles that are practically written for them. Piotr Beczala never disappoints and that remains true for his Prince; I will add though that I liked Pavel Cernoch better in the prostitue production. Emily Magee is a waste as the Foreign Princess; the role is too small for her talent and she never gets the chance to shine like we know she can.
We should all be so lucky to have a piece of art we love so much. Rusalka will be released in a few weeks and there's a spot on my shelf waiting for it. This is the Rusalka to add to your library!",1440892800,35,2280,4.367058823529412

2245885,5,B0007VY5JE,"I had no problem with the film at ll, for I realized it could open the world of opera to children because, indeed, it is a ""fairy tale"".  Great voices, beautiful actors and gorgeous cinematography.  But, I still want a staged performance, and the comments I have read seem to point out no one is good enough.  Any suggestions?  Please help me avoid Eurotrash!",1435708800,,359,4.5625
2245886,4,B0007VY5JE,"I might not have purchased this beautiful production of Rusalka had the Metropolitan Opera got around to making a Blu-Ray or DVD of their traditional 2014 Met production with Renee Fleming.  Over a year later, they - sadly- have not.  Thus, to view about the only other TRADITIONAL production of Rusalka (and not some ""Eurotrash"" version which is about all that exists these days :-(  ),  I obtained this verdant 1960s production which stars actors who have the arias dubbed by actual opera singers.  This is an all-Czech production accompanied by a wonderful orchestra.  It's been said that ""Dvorak never wrote a bad note"" and I believe it based on my familiarity with his music.  So why just 4 stars and not 5?  (I'd given 4-1/2 stars were that option available, but it's not; Amazon should enable 1/2 stars).  The singing and naturalistic outdoor film is certainly a 5.  So is the orchestral performance.  I detracted a (half) point for a misguided concept where it seems that all ""underwater"" scenes are filmed in a distinctively green hue (similar to the DVD case you see with this review).  About the first third of the film, and about the final quarter takes place ""underwater"" (beneath a sylvan pond or lake- which is filmed very well, i.e., towards the end of the opera).  The green may appear ""swampy"" or ""verdant"" to some, or ""nauseating"" to others. Take your pick. It permeates those parts of the opera.  Also, there's some double/overlapping images, such as a few times when Rusalka's father (King of the water sprites) sings to his daughter .  But the middle section of the opera, e.g., with the Prince, the Dance at his palace, and some romantic interludes with Rusalka and the Prince, and the Prince's ""other lady friend"", are in natural colors... actually rather attractive.  The Polannaise ""ballet""/dance with the Prince's retinue has some eye-popping color (dresses, uniforms, etc.)  The orchestra shines here.  The singing is very good, but just not the same as having the singers doing their own acting. Subtitles are white and sometimes blend into light backgrounds; otherwise, they're OK.  Maestro Chalabala conducts the orchestra skillfully and tenderly.  You never see the orchestra, but they certainly know their stuff.  Overall, I Highly Recommend this opera production, old as it is,...the next best thing to the 2014 Met production.  The only version that might exceed this Czech production some day is when the Met decides to release their February 2014 production with Renee Fleming on DVD/Blu-Ray.  This, too, is a traditional version, with no green coloration (available now only as a ""Met, Live in HD"" format online),  complete with a realistic appearing pond or lake, scenery and costumes are traditional and Fleming struts her stuff singing her signature arias, such as ""Song to the Moon"" and other gorgeous music, backed up by the outstanding Met orchestra. The Met 2014 production, when released, will become perhaps the first traditional staging of Rualka in some 50+ years.  We're long, long overdue for an updated, traditional Rusalka on DVD/Blu-Ray.  The Met has it, but for some reason is depriving the opera world of their 2014 DVD/Blu-Ray of what is known to be an exquisite traditional production of this Czech classic.",1429920000,5,3265,5.022304832713755
2245887,5,B0007VY5JE,"One of the very best opera DVDs I have come across. Even if you have not previously enjoyed Dvorak's opera you will on this DVD. A model of how an opera which is awkward to stage can be made vital when technology removes it from the constraints of the opera house.  Very good actors for the two main parts.  The opera is cut in this DVD version, however, so you will need to own CDs of a complete performance as well to supplement it - CDs of this particular performance are easily available at a reasonable price.",1278720000,13,514,4.288659793814433
2245888,4,B0007VY5JE,"Unlike the other reviewers I found this filmed version of the opera quite charming. It definitely captures the fairy tale atmosphere and is beautiful both to listen to and to see. Certainly it is preferable to the nonsensical French production set in a nursery (or asylum, perhaps?) and better than watching a mature matron cavorting on the stage of the Metropolitan.",1236988800,15,367,5.032786885245901

2245890,2,B0007VY5JE,"I suppose that Czech TV viewers thought this was great when they saw it in 1975.  But, it simply doesn't hold-up to modern audiences' expectations.  There's a lot of pointless running around in the meadow, the castle grounds, and under the water.  Visually, the film is simply uninteresting.  The costumes are awful, as is the acting.  Yet, cutting the music to 2 hours wasn't annoying since none of the libretto seems to be missing.  And, it is a blessing that the story hasn't been updated here to modern times.  The dubbing is poorly done. Eduard Haken (as the Watersprite) and Vaclav Bednar (as the Hunter) sing (dub) their original 1961 rolls.  Since neither Katerina Machackova (as Rusalka) and Miroslav Nohynek (as the Prince) can act, in spite of their attractiveness and youth, I still have to wonder why the director didn't simply let the singers of the roles do the ""acting.""  I realize the 1961 singers were probably too old to be convincing, but I would have preferred the director simply find new singers and scrap the 1961 recording.",1118880000,20,1048,4.810055865921788
2245891,5,B0007VY5JE,"With out doubt the best production of Rusalka available.  Rene Fleming is outstanding as are all the cast.

2245894,5,B0007VY5JE,This is the video of the Met production with Renee Fleming.  I use it to teach the opera to kids and regardless of their age they are transfixed. It's interesting to see it from up close as opposed to in the house.,1499558400,,214,4.095238095238095

2245896,5,B0007VY5JE,Much better than the Met's new production. Beautifully sung and the sets are vastly better than the new ones.,1489276800,2,109,4.7894736842105265
2245897,3,B0007VY5JE,"This is one of two commercial DVD releases Renee Fleming made of Rusalka. The other one was from Paris in 2002. Overall I think the Paris production is a better buy. For one, Renee is in fresher voice in Paris -- in 2014 she can still sing the part, but there's a hoarseness and thinness that creeps into her tone. ""Song to the Moon"" no longer has the firmness of vocal line or the silvery timbre. To see what she could do vocally with the role the Paris production is superior. The Robert Carsen might not be to the hardcore traditionalists' tastes but it is a very beautiful effective production and more imaginative than the Schenk production.

Secondly, the old Otto Schenk production at the Met by 2014 was falling into disrepair, which the HD cameramen tried to offset by having an excessively dark screen. Act Three in particular is so dark that you can sometimes barely make out the faces. Too bad, because the production has its own old-fashioned, picturesque beauty. The costumes are also looking their age -- at one point Renee appears to be wearing mud-brown stockings.

There are plusses to this video. Piotr Beczala's Prince is unusually sensitive and well-sung, probably superior vocally to Sergei Larin in Paris. Dolora Zajick as Jezibaba remains a vocal wonder. John Relyea is vocally elegant (if a bit underpowered) as the water gnome.

However Rusalka is all about Rusalka and there are better options to hear Renee's Rusalka. The Mackerras studio recording is another good choice.",1486080000,3,1500,4.8515625
2245898,5,B0007VY5JE,"The sets are gorgeous.  Fleming is physically gorgeous, making it believable, and she backs it up with gorgeous singing.

2245909,5,B0007VY5JE,"This wonderful opera was amazing to say the least. Basically every single aspect was great. The score, The cast, the conductor, the production was all superb.
 To start the score was to die for, Dvorak is an incredibly underrated composer. To me Dvorak is up there with Bizet, Puccini and Gounod. His score is beautifully crafted with to die for melodies and his wagneresque use of leitmotifs in the opera makes it that much better. The highlight for me are the beautiful slavonic dances, the song to the moon and overall everything. The libereti is so beautiful and poetic that it pairs beautifully with Dvoraks score. The conducting and cast only seem to shine a brighter light on the genius of Dvorak.
 The cast was so amazingly put together it's hard to believe. To begin I am now a true believer in the genius of Miss. Fleming who is a god!! Renee Fleming delivered a wonderful performance with her creamy bright voice that brought out the beauty and vividness of the character. Her acting only bettered her performance. No wonder Rusalka is one of her trademark roles. Piotr Beczala was a perfect prince to Miss. Fleming's Rusalka. His singing and acting was on point and he filled the shoes of anyone who has sung that role before him. Dolora Zajick was perhaps one of the best performances of the night aside from Renee. She sung the role of Jezibaba like no one else and brought a sense of comedy and campiness to the character ( in a good way) that only made her performance more entertaining. The only question i have for Dvorak is why he only put Jezibaba in parts of the opera, because i kept on wanting more. The wonderful supporting cast of Emily Magee, John Relyea, Vladimir Chmelo, Julie Boulianne, Dsella Lrusdttir, Rene Tatum and  Maya Lahyani were ideally cast and only added to the opera excellence.
 Yannick Nzet-Sguin is perhaps my favorite conductor. His Carmen and Faust were amazing but he did fantastic in Rusalka. He conducted the met orchestra with such jeux de vivre and passion it could stand alone. The Met should value him more because dare i say he's better than Levine. He drew every note from the score so beautifully i think Dvorak himself could not do better.
 The traditional Otto Schenk production is so fantastic and beautiful i don't think think one leaf was out of place. Gnther Schneider-Siemssen who did the sets did a beautiful job creating them and they look extraordinary on the met stage. Sylvia Strahammer who did the costumes did a beautiful and exquisite job designating the blue colors with the water spirits and the red colors for the prince and overall making everything look beautiful. Every aspect of the production was only accentuated by the live in hd aspects.
 Overall Rusalka was beautiful, exquisite and amazing and is a must have for any opera lover.",1457308800,2,2814,4.74437627811861

When I watched the DVD I wasn't disappointment, it was very good. The singing and acting were amazing, even the little roles were very good. It had a very strong cast lead by Renee Fleming in the main character; Jezibaba and The Prince played by Dolora Zajick and Piotr Beczala respectively were very convincing in their roles.
The scenery was beautiful for example the scene with Rusalka singing the Song of the Moon among tree branches watching the moon and evoking the love she feels was very tender. The music as every thing written by Dvorac was delightful; I enjoyed the duets between Rusalka and the Prince as well as the rest of the scores.

 The part of Rusalka requires a person who not only has an excellent voice but is still young enough to make the part believable. There aren't many, in todays opera circles, who could have accomplished that. To my mind, there are but two: Fleming and Netrebko and this opera doesn't seem to be within Netrebko's repetoire.

 This is an excellently performed, traditionally costumed and traditionally staged version of this opera. This one is a keeper.",1444608000,,710,4.8429752066115705

Likewise, Renee Fleming is winding down her opera career, but her voice is still one of the most beautiful around, and she is more involved in the drama than she used to be, now that she has lived with the character for many years.  The supporting cast - Piotr Beczala, John Relyea, Dolora Zajick, and Emily Magee - could not be bettered.  Amazon is wrong about one thing: This Blu-ray is NOT coded for Region 2 only.

I sincerely hope that this way of spoiling a DVD will not become a fashion. Four stars only, because of this superfluous stuff.",1524268800,,552,4.760416666666667

8052366,5,B0007VY5JE,"Renee Fleming is the best soprano in serious opera. She captures the very soul of Rusalka and makes the mournful story come alive.
The Little Mermaid story is sad, but is so well done.
The production is the best and highlights not only the singers, but the orchestra and staging as well",1518912000,,286,4.519230769230769
