7882957,5,6305107742,I loved this exercise video and it is wonderful for someone who only wants a milder form of kickboxing. I would tell anyone to buy it and use it.,1380067200,,145,4.0344827586206895
7882958,1,6305107742,"This video sucked BIG TIME... I was looking for a good cardio kickboxing tape to add to my collection... I thought I'd give it a shot.. If could have reached in a grabbed that woman I would have.. her voice is annoying, her counting is annoying, this tape is annoying...
They seemed out of breath before they even got started..
I did find some use though.. I will use this tape as a door stop.",1039996800,,393,4.253333333333333
7882959,1,6305107742,"As a kickboxing instructor, this was truly a disappointment.  I always buy new tapes to get ideas, but this was a pathetic display of kickboxing abilities.  It is apparent that they put that girl in the video because she was cute, BUT OH SO ANNOYING!. She seemed quite proud of herself that she could stay on the beat with the music, ""5,6,7,8""  After hearing her count over and over for the first five minutes I wanted to strangle her.
Don't waste your money.",1037577600,,459,4.506024096385542
7882960,1,6305107742,"PLEASE!  Don't buy this video!  What a scam!  I even felt compelled to write the producers of this video to tell them how they were obviously trying to ""dupe"" the general public!  As a professional martial artist with over 14 years of training, and a certified aerobic kickboxing instructor, I must say that this is the WORST video on the subject I've ever seen (and I own them all!).  The stars of this video have no martial arts/kickboxing training whatsoever--they were obviously hired for their looks. There are so many good videos out there, for example the ""GI Jabb"" series with Katalin Zamiar, or Joe Lewis' aerobic kickboxing videos, that there's no need to buy this type of trash.  Save your money!",976924800,5,707,4.754098360655738
7882961,1,6305107742,"As a kickbox instructor, I like to purchase kickbox videos for additional ideas to use in my classes.  I read the 5-star review, purchased the video,  but ended up thoroughly disappointed.  I found  several problems with the  with weights is too fast,  the woman's counting is not at all at a  consistant speed (but IS monotonous), the kickbox movements are sequenced  in a very strange manner--it's hard to keep the heart rate up.  Don't waste  your money on this one; there are a lot of good kickbox videos available.",950400000,2,519,4.730337078651686
