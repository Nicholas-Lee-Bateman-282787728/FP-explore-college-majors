It moves pretty slowly, but it does have entertaining features, such as real animal photos, funny masks, and video of kids playing on the beach. The speakers are not native, but they seem to be taking care to speak clearly and use correct inflections. There is a decent amount of repetition. Even though my son refuses to repeat any of the words, I think it is training his ear to pick up Chinese more easily later. I find the pin ying subtitles helpful and wish they were provided throughout, instead of just the first time each word is introduced and during the recap at the end.",1342569600,,714,4.416666666666667
8496439,5,B000V4ZW2Q,"I am a Chinese American while my husband is Caucasian. Although we speak English at home, we really want our daughters to be able to speak Mandarin as well. The Bao Bei DVDs have been great and definitely a hit in our home. My almost 3 year old is always asking to watch Bao Bei and my 10 month old is fascinated by the colors and characters in the DVDs.

What's most fascinating is that my almost 3 year old now can name all the colors as well as count in Mandarin. If you are a parent and want your kids exposed to and learn Mandarin Chinese, definitely get all the Bao Bei DVD series!",1217289600,,587,4.104347826086957
