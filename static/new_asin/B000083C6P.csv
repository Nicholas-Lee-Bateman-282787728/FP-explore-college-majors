I remember as a little girl growing up with Strawberry Shortcake and how many wonderful happy memories I had. I am so happy to share my joy with her.  I purchased all the strawberry shortcake DVDs below and enjoy watching her smile and giggle:
- Meet Strawberry Shortcake (2003)
- Get Well Adventure (2003)
- Berry, Merry Christmas (2003)
The colors, graphics and songs are great; in addition, I especially liked the options of different languages (English/Spanish).I also bought for her the Strawberry Shortcake Berry Talking Friend doll.  My daughter loves this doll as it sings and has lots of cute phrases.
I am glad they brought her back!!!  Thank you!!!",1072742400,6,770,4.953488372093023

It has cute and catchy songs through the whole thing and it keeps their interest through the entire movie. it also has an extra music video in it, even my 9 month old pays attention to the movie. i think its really cute that the dvd and case also smell like strawberries. i would highly recommend this to any parent",1057795200,,414,4.1875
1823678,5,B000083C6P,"My 3 year old daughter LOVES this movie, so we watch it over and over again. Thank goodness the songs are cute otherwise I'd be going out of my mind right now.",1057363200,,159,4.0
1823679,3,B000083C6P,I don't like remakes of good shows. Except the Alvin and the Chipmunks(80's version)! This remake of Strawberry Shortcake is cute but I'd prefer the original 100%. Ya can't beat the classics. I don't like the new version of Scooby Doo either. This version lacks the Charm that made me fall in love with the original.,1052006400,6,316,4.660714285714286
1823680,5,B000083C6P,"I recommend this DVD to all fans of strawberry shortcake. I was such a huge fan of her back in the 80's and now my niece just loves her .... She watches and sings every song they sing and adores strawberries little sister apple dumplin. With all the old cartoons that are coming back are so cute, first was hello kitty now its strawberry shortcake and next should be rainbow brite because that was another great classic cartoon and Im sure it will be a big hit with kids.",1049673600,3,471,4.303370786516854
1823681,5,B000083C6P,"This is a cute DVD, something that wasn't mentioned, is that the DVD is berry scented!!! I giggled all over the place when I opened up the DVD, and the sweet smell of strawberry land filled my head! It's a cute story, a new updated theme song, and all the strawberry fun you could ask for!",1047859200,4,289,4.178571428571429
1823682,4,B000083C6P,"Strawberry Shortcake is cute... cute beyond belief... cute to the point of sickening.  If you are a child of the 1980s and watched this show, you need to own it for the memories alone.  It has a happy feel good message that a lot of current shows are lacking.  There is a complete absence of violence.  It is a nice change of pace from pap like Pokemon and Sailor Moon.",1047600000,5,369,4.228571428571429

7978527,5,B000083C6P,"I'm creating a review just to say that the musical numbers in this video are surprisingly well done. Andy Street is credited as the songwriter, and he did a good job.

* ""Springtime"" is in 3/4 time and features a medieval-esque woodwind melody. It's a lovely, childlike little number that captures the innocence of early childhood and springtime at once.

* ""Why Don't We Work Together"" reminds me of a marching song. It has fun key changes and harmonies, and has other cast members gradually joining Strawberry as she inspires them. And is that a harpsichord in the background?? It is!

* ""We're Jammin'"" is a reggae-style song with drums. Listen for the key change, the a capella phrases, and the the joyful ending!

* ""I Put the Zing in Spring"" is a fast little song with leaps around the octave, lots of diction, fun to sing. I find myself humming it to myself -- ""ice is nice but green's supreme""!

* A bonus song after the show is Gingersnap singing about snapping her fingers. It's almost like a Gilbert & Sullivan patter song.

Because of the music, I would far rather listen to this video all day than any of the other lackluster children's videos in our collection. Thanks, Andy Street and other associated music makers!",1304812800,,1230,4.645161290322581
7978528,4,B000083C6P,"I bought this movie as a Christmas present for my two- and four- year old daughters.  They already love Strawberry Shortcake, so I knew this would go over well.  They do really like this movie, although not as much as the other Strawberry Shortcake movie we own--The Sweet Dreams Movie--which they LOVE.",1294444800,,303,4.8076923076923075
7978529,5,B000083C6P,My 6 year old daughter loved this movie. She say's it has a nice message about working together and friendships.,1238284800,,112,4.65
7978530,3,B000083C6P,"This Strawberry Shortcake video was just ""okay.""  The story about finding ""Spring"" did not intrigue my daughters (ages 2 and 3) as much as some of the other videos... We also own Moonlight Mysteries, Seaberry Beach, and World of Friends.  My kids much prefer the other videos, and in that order.",1156204800,,295,4.764705882352941
7978531,3,B000083C6P,"It's all about being a little girl. My 6-year-old likes this tape just fine, but not as well as the ""Meet Strawberry Shortcake"" that kicked off the new series and new product line of related merchandise. It's wintertime and Strawberry must find Spring, who winds up looking like a redheaded Tinkerbell. Grouchy old Custard the cat still has to be coerced into enjoying herself, everybody still lives on sugar, and it's all very colorful and sweet. Kid stuff, sure, and beats the socks off negative stuff like ""Rugrats.""",1090454400,6,519,4.909090909090909
