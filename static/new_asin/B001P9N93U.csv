3744374,2,B001P9N93U,"I've read the other reviews and I can't agree with everything said. To me this movie was your typical 'evil hospital, mad doctor' story. The acting was fine, but I was bored. The only thing that was unusual about this movie was how the doctor used the boyfriend as life support. It was full of gore, I'll give it that, but it was so typical. And as far as being ""campy"" or ""laughable"", ""Dr. Giggles"" was funnier.",1239148800,,412,4.363636363636363
3744375,4,B001P9N93U,"""Autopsy"" is exactly what it is supposed to be, a gross out slasher flick that delivers not only great gore effects but an off the chain Heroine (Jessica Lowndes) who is not only beautiful but BAD A**..
Picture Hostel in a Hospital with a lot more gore and some cheese but in a good way..it delivers on every level a mindless slasher should deliver.

I also LOVE the character of Jude played by (Ross McCall) of the Stars series ""Crash""..He gets his pick of pharmaceuticals which are offered by one of the shady Security guys played by great bad guy Character Actor (Robert LaSardohooses)He picks 'with some coaxing' the wrong one and takes an unwanted hallucinogenic trip and that's the last thing you want to do when your in an abandoned hospital filled with people chasing you with sharp objects. This film also delivers one of the coolest scenes via How to get an unwanted naked man off of you scenes ever.. The guy who played Buck in Kill Bill Vol One(Michael Bowden) has a great role in this a well. Gotta Love it",1238544000,,1019,4.538043478260869
3744376,4,B001P9N93U,I also agree its the second best in this years series right behind From Within. The first is a little campy but the second half of the movie kicks in and its good gory fun. Very enjoyable.,1238112000,,188,4.108108108108108
3744377,3,B001P9N93U,"As this year's After Dark films go, this is hands down the second best of the lot. It's funny and quirky in that Friday night at the movies stoner kind of way. A bunch of teenagers stuck in a strange hospital.

It is no Session 9  but it doesn't aim to be.

Director Adam Gierasch still is yet to prove his worth but this movie has such an obviously low budget that I'd like to see what he could do with some more money - so long as it's not Hostel 3!!!.

It's easy not in the same class as From Within but if you like this sort of movie it delivers in its own way.",1238112000,,565,3.8448275862068964
3744378,4,B001P9N93U,"There are few things worse than a trash film that wants to be taken seriously. ""Autopsy"" is not like that--it encourages us to laugh, as well it should. On the basis of the preposterous story and the disgusting visuals, neither the filmmakers nor the cast gave this film a single serious thought.  That's a piece of advice you should follow if you decide to see it. It's exuberant horror movie fun, bloody and brainless, its tongue planted firmly in its cheek. I watched what was happening and there were moments when I just had to laugh out loud, if not because it was funny, then because it was so over the top that screaming in terror hardly seemed appropriate. If you want further proof of its outrageousness, consider the fact that it features performances by Robert Patrick and Jenette Goldstein, who were featured in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" as the T-1000 terminator and John Conner's foster mother. Need I say more?

The plot: Claire (Ashley Schneider), her boyfriend, Bobby (Ross Kohn), and their friends Jude (Ross McCall), Emily (Jessica Lowndes), and Andrey (Arcadiy Golubovich) are on their way home after a wild night celebrating Mardi Gras; they get into a car accident and discover that they have run over a man wearing nothing but a hospital gown. It isn't long before an ambulance arrives, and the paramedics take the man away along with everyone else. Already, something isn't right. It only gets worse when they arrive at the hilariously named Mercy Hospital, which seems oddly empty. The prim and proper Nurse Marian (Goldstein) sits behind the front desk, talking calls on an old phone, speaking in an airy Southern accent that somehow compliments her out-of-fashion nurse's uniform.

When Bobby removes a six-inch long glass shard from his side, he passes out, and Nurse Marian immediately carries him away. It isn't long before she returns to the front desk and tells Claire that the doctor is ready to examine her. Here enters Dr. Benway (Patrick), who seems approachable even though his white lab coat gives him that menacing air of a classic mad scientist. For reasons not entirely clear to me, the fact that Claire was once a med school student seems to interest him. This might account for the special physical exam he gives her right in his office, which includes checking her breathing with a stethoscope, looking at her eyes and throat with a penlight, and giving her an on-the-spot spinal tap. Trust me, you don't want to know what he does with the fluid once he removes it.

I don't dare reveal what sinister events these moments lead to. But let's discuss some of the subplots that build suspense. One of Benway's assistants, Scott (Robert LaSardo), finds Jude smoking pot in the bathroom. He then leads Jude to a room full of medications and offers him anything he wants; this inevitably leads to the discovery of a pill that, according to Scott, hasn't even been approved by the FDA. Another one of Benway's assistants, Travis (Michael Bowen), is one of those hotheaded guys that really has something against women, and we know this for reasons other than his occasional use of foul language.

And then there's the horrifying discovery that other patients are scattered throughout the hospital. (Actually, I'm assuming that they're scattered; if memory serves, we only see two of them.) One of them is a skinny young girl with a grotesquely pale face. Claire discovers her as she wanders around, looking for Bobby; in one of the film's greatest moments of implausibility, she walks slowly towards this scary-looking patient, never afraid, lightening flashing through the windows all the while. If there's one thing horror movies have taught me, it's that you should never, ever walk towards something scary while lightening is flashing.

Dr. Benway's sinister plot is too deliciously evil to give away. Let's just say that the rest of film involves a lot of blood and a lot of body parts. There's a priceless moment when Scott wheels out a tray full of severed limbs just as a cop happens to walk by. How the cop came to arrive at Mercy Hospital isn't important. Neither is an explanation for how a patient is able to survive when his organs have been removed and suspended above his body, branched out like a tree.

I appreciate films that can make trash seem like an art form. I also appreciate films that are trashy without being exploitive. That might seem like a contradiction, but the way I see it, exploitation and a film like ""Autopsy"" fall into two separate categories: The former thrives on unwatchable moments of abuse and degradation, whereas the latter thrives on the spirit of campy good fun. In other words, this movie is too ridiculous to be offensive. It's a parody, a goofy sideshow, a story so laughably bad that it had to have been intentionally made that way. It seems unlikely that director/co-writer Adam Gierasch was trying to make a reputable film; if anything, he was trying to be as disreputable as possible, which is exactly right given the nature of mad scientists conducting gory medical experiments on unsuspecting people. ""Autopsy"" deserves credit for the sheer audacity of the filmmakers--many would have lacked the nerve to make it, and many more would have lacked the nerve to release it in theaters.",1231977600,3,5276,4.868596881959911
3744379,4,B001P9N93U,"A somewhat uncommon subgenre of the slasher film is, of course, the ""evil hospital"" film. I've always been partial to those. ""Autopsy"" may be the finest example I've seen yet. The setup: a group of college-age kids leaving Mardi Gras get involved in a car accident. An ambulance shows up out of nowhere, with some very unconventional attendants. They talk the kids into coming with them for a checkup at the hospital. The kids get to the extremely creepy Mercy Hospital, a really bossy nurse starts splitting them up, and much merriment, gore and splatter ensues. This flick has SUCH a nasty sense of humor! I repeatedly found myself laughing at things I know I really shouldn't. And talk about gore! Wow! There are a few scenes that are so spectacularly nasty and original that I found myself gasping, giggling, and gagging all at the same time. (Not an easy feat.) It also has a female protagonist who can kick some serious butt--always on the list of my favorite things. If ""Hostel"" meets ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes"" sounds like fun to you, do not miss this movie!",1231718400,8,1067,4.711229946524064

I expected a bit more from Patrick-who seemed to dial it in, but was pleased with Lasardo's performance. His positively giddy nature when erasing the possible identification avenues from the bits of victims and when showing the ""Chemical Disneyland"" were laugh out loud funny.

I love hospitals as a setting for horror movies. I originally fell for the sub-genre when I discovered Mayasuki Ochiai's Infection, a sublime masterpiece of its kind.
This one had me when I heard the name Dr Benway. It is of course, a reference to William S Burroughs' famous character of that name, a character who's been riffed on by the Firesign Theater and many others. Bless Burroughs' for creating a horror archetype right up there next to Cthulhu. But I digress. Robert Patrick plays Benway with a fine neutrality. Straight laced fellow, probably a competent physician at one time who happens to have GONE MAD TRYING TO KEEP HIS AILING MOTHER FROM DYING AND WHO IS PERFORMING HIDEOUS EXPERIMENTS ON PEOPLE INCLUDING RIPPING THEIR HEARTS OUT AND LINKING THEM TOGETHER WHILE THEY'RE STILL BEATING!!!!

Adam Gierasch assumes the role of director after co-writing a number of minor successes that include MORTUARY and the TOOLBOX MURDERS remake. Here, he makes the same mistake as Adam Green and Robert Hall had in HATCHET and LAID TO REST, putting the film's gory effects before the plot or characters. While it is true that AUTOPSY offers some gruesome scenes of gut-spilling, it seems hardly worth the wait while trudging through the underused sets and underwhelming performances from both Robert Patrick and Jenette Goldstein as the two sadistic villains. Jessica Lowndes stands out in the lead, but the rest of the teens play to type and do nothing to draw upon the audience's sympathies as they are being sliced and diced. Unfortunately, little would improve in Gierasch's blood-soaked remake to NIGHT OF THE DEMONS the following year.

3744568,3,B001P9N93U,"Autopsy is probably not the right word for this film.  Autopsies are performed on cadavers - i.e., dead people - and the poor patients checking into this hospital are all quite alive when a mad doctor decides to remove their organs.  ""Vivisection"" would be more appropriate, but then Autopsy isn't interested in accuracy.

Autopsy wisely doesn't even bother with character development.  A gaggle of foolish friends are returning home from Mardi Gras when they hit somebody with their car.  An ambulance arrives, the dazed victim is carted off, and our protagonists are whisked into  creepy Mercy Hospital. Considering the circumstances, it's understandable that they didn't ask the EMTs for identification.

They should have, because two of the EMTs are actually ex-convicts (Michael Bowen as Travis and Robert LaSardo as heavily-tattooed Scott, the less insane of the two). A Nurse Ratched-style matron guards the front door (Jenette Goldstein, our very own Private Vasquez from Aliens).  Goldstein, who also was John Connor's adopted mom in Terminator 2, teams up again with Robert Patrick as Doctor David Benway. They are on a mission to prolong the life of Benway's bedridden wife, using science. What kind of science?  MAD science of course!

What makes Autopsy so effective is its gleeful embrace of every disturbing hospital phobia: fear of infection, the needles, anesthesia not working, spinal taps, stitches popping, blood spilling, doctors with a cold bedside manner, pushy nurses, being anesthetized against your will, unnecessary tests, and not to mention all the healthcare costs!  Okay, that last one I made up but you get the idea - anyone watching Autopsy who is afraid of hospitals will be in a fetal position by the end of this film.

Autopsy is body horror at its finest. The victims are all there to die, of course. With no personalities to speak of, we can only feel sympathy through their pain.  The movie even has some comedic moments, getting away with jokes it shouldn't only because we're relieved to laugh after so much horror.

Autopsy is as much mood as it is a movie. As such, not all of it makes sense.  The victims seem intent on just wandering around the hospital despite the opportunity to flee on several occasions.  Things explode that shouldn't, liquids flow that can't, and the victims pretty much follow standard horror-trope stupidity.  If you're rooting for people to survive in Autopsy, you will walk away very frustrated.

But if you're here to see blood and guts - and lets face it, the movie is named Autopsy for a reason - then you will get bloods and guts in your face.  The ending is a bit tired and the pacing occasionally off, but for the most part Autopsy delivers on its weird and disgusting promise: to show the insides of living people.

I still think it should be called Vivisection though.",1288915200,2,2846,4.939075630252101

3744570,2,B001P9N93U,"Autopsy (Adam Gierasch, 2008)

I cannot for the life of me figure out whether I like Adam Gierasch or not. While he, along with writing partner Jace Anderson, was almost entirely responsible for Tobe Hooper's resurgence as a director of quirky, fun little horror flicks (Toolbox Murders and Mortuary were both scripted by Anderson and Gierash), the two were also responsible for the braindead abortion that was Mother of Tears, as well as lame creature features like Spiders, Rats (directed by no less a personage than Tibor Takacs, Hungary's version of Uwe Boll), and Crocodile. Not to mention a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie, which is usually enough to sink anyone's ship. Gierasch must have gotten tired of having has-been horror directors filming his and Anderson's stuff, though, because he stepped behind the camera for the first time for Autopsy, which the boys co-wrote with Home Sick writer E. L. Katz. I'm kind of surprised that a writing team of this (inconsistent, but still) caliber turned out a movie this painfully derivative (just in the past five years, Vital, Room 6, Unrest, and a couple of Saw movies have all trod this ground), but I probably shouldn't be.

Plot: a bunch of young-and-beautifuls get into a car accident and get picked up by two very odd paramedics (Deadgirl's Michael Bowen and the great, and ubiquitous, Robert LaSardo, who most recently flashed his neck ink in Nip/Tuck and Death Race). They get transported to an even odder hospital, whose entire staff seems to consist of annoying, screechy nurse Marian (Near Dark's Jennette Goldstein) and creepy doctor David Benway (The Unit's Robert Patrick). One of the y-and-bs, Emily (90210's Jessica Lowndes), being marginally more sober (and less stupid) than her peers, starts realizing there's something very wrong here, oh, halfway through the movie. Of course, by then, most of her peers are dead...

I've now seen three of the eight films from After Dark Horrorfest 3, and to be fair, Autopsy is orders of magnitude better than either Slaughter or Perkins 14 (and, for that matter, I can only think of three Horrorfest films from previous years that measure up--Nacho Cerda's Abandoned, the aforementioned Unrest, and J. S. Cardone's Wicked Little Things). That does not, however, make it a good movie in the larger set of all movies, or even all movies that tread this ground. You've seen all this before at least a dozen times, though maybe no one ever thought to fit the pieces together in quite this way, and not (in America anyway) with actors who have names this big. Be that as it may, there is nothing to distinguish this from other films of its stripe vis-a-vis plot, characters, acting, direction, blah blah blah, and if there's one thing American low-budget horror films desperately need, it's something to distinguish them from the mass of nameless low-budget horror films that get released in this country every year. Not an awful way to kill an hour and a half, but you could do much better things with it. Like playing solitaire while being tazed every ten minutes by a rabid lemur with Crohn's disease. **",1263600000,,3108,4.927480916030534
3744571,3,B001P9N93U,"A group of five friends are returning home after visiting New Orleans during Mardi Gras.  They have an accident along a deserted highway, hitting a man who wandered out of the woods.  By ""chance"" an ambulance happens by and takes the entire group to a desolate hospital.  Now of course, you or I or anyone of rational intelligence would run from this place when they see the creepy orderlies Travis and Scott, or the even creepier head nurse Marian (Jenette Goldstein of ""Aliens and ""Near Dark"").  But this is a horror movie and common sense is typically tossed out the window so one can enjoy the ride.

By common sense, I mean that one should refrain from getting up and exploring the near empty hospital on their own.  I've been in lots of hospitals, often in the middle of the night and I've never had the urge to get up and wander the halls.  Nurse Marian's happy Southern charm isn't nearly enough to neutralize what we know immediately is a sinister motive and her happy countenance soon turns to anger as she chastises the kids for not waiting their turn in the lobby.

Their ""turn"" is their appointment with the man behind the hospital, Dr. David Benway (Patrick) and his easygoing bedside manner almost fools you into thinking he might not be so bad.  Benway, however is conducting some very ""Dr. Frankenstein"" like experiments for reasons which will be revealed soon enough.

As usual in these films we have a female heroine.  Here it is Emily (Lowndes) who scours the hospital looking for her boyfriend, Bobby, the first patient of Dr. Benway's.  Emily discovers the twisted experiments performed by the sadistic staff and is in the fight for her life to survive.

From a technical standpoint, Autopsy is well made.  The setting of the aged hospital with its old-fashioned dial phones and 1950s styling adds atmosphere to the film.  Fans of gore will not be disappointed as the violence is extremely graphic and there are body parts aplenty strewn across the screen, not to mention intestines.

The performances are a mixed bag...Patrick, Goldstein, and the two cruel orderlies revel in their roles while the victims are exceedingly dull stereotypes and even Lowndes isn't very fun to watch given the choice heroine's role.

Autopsy is predictable but that's almost a given in films of this type.  The setting is great and the villains play their roles to the hilt making this a passable entry into this year's After Dark Horrorfest series.",1258588800,,2452,4.7976190476190474
3744572,4,B001P9N93U,"The last of the ""8 Films To Die For"" that I watched this year is also probably the most ""enjoyable.""  Whereas the other films seemed to want to encourage my suicide with grim themes and cold atmospheres, AUTOPSY harkens back to the old days of horror with gleefully over-the-top psychos and buckets of gore.

This is not to suggest AUTOPSY is the best film of the festival, but it is perhaps the most wildly entertaining.  The threadbare story is of five college kids in Louisiana who end up in a car crash.  Next thing you know, they are being whisked away to a nearby hospital, sharing an ambulance with a man they ran over, who they are told had left the hospital prior to an operation.

It becomes clear as soon as they arrive that this is not General Hospital!  The nurse methodically separates each kid from the others, until only our leading lady, Emily, is left wondering the deserted halls looking for her friends.  Soon enough she will be fleeing the resident ""mad doctor,"" who apparently is harvesting organs to keep his dying wife alive.

Now, fear not - I am not revealing plot twists or surprises here, because this is not a movie about story and mystery - it's a simple plot upon which to hang some truly gruesome scenes.  If you enjoy gore, you'll find plenty to love about this film - hacked-off limbs, drills to the head, faces pummeled to bloody pulp, intestines spilling all over other people (literally), and a truly bizarre live-operation that has to be seen to be believed!

Fortunately, the filmmakers realize what they are making here, and never for a moment try to make a serious attempt at realism.  While the movie isn't silly, like the EVIL DEAD franchise, it does keeps a funhouse tone all throughout.  The actors play their roles suitably, with Jenette Goldstein perhaps having the best moments as the germ-phobic nurse.  Camera, lighting, staging are all done effectively for the genre.

I would probably have placed this film at the top of the heap, but there are some issues with the final act that let me down a bit.  Firstly, the writers seem to run out of energy before the film ends, and we end up with A LOT of scenes of people just walking around empty halls to span the time.  This happens enough that the audience has time to start wondering why these kids don't just leave the hospital.  And, just when you'd expect a thrill-ride chase to begin when we are down to our final victim, again the pace seems to lag, and then the next thing you know, it's over.

And, there are some truly bad edits toward the end.  In one scene, our heroine is caught and trapped, and then we see one of the boys whom we thought had left suddenly enter the room.  But rather than turn to see the confrontation going on, he just casually WALKS straight through the scene like he's headed off for coffee or something.  Emily then easily gets out of the hold the doctor has on her and runs off in his direction.  Next shot, the two are running for their lives down some stairs without any conversation as to why he left he behind, or why he came back.  It's a very awkward moment that destroys the carefully constructed mood of the chase.

Shortly after, we see have a shot of Emily walking upstairs (again, at a point when she no longer has a reason to be there, and should be hoofing it out the door).  This shot is CLEARLY from earlier in the movie, as she is holding a weapon she lost several scene before and her shirt is suddenly clean after she had vomited all over it previously.  In the next shot, she is again weaponless and shirt-stained.

But these are minor quibbles - the worst moment is the closing moment of the film, which is so bad and tacked on, it truly has the effect of rendering the entire previous 90 minutes null and void.  It smacks of a last minute reshoot. It makes me think again that the writers ran out of energy or interest and just said, ""ah, we'll just do this . . . that's good enough.""  After having enjoyed the rest of the film, I was left shaking my head wondering WHAT IN THE WORLD they were thinking!  Unfortunately, a bad ending can really ruin an otherwise good film, and that's the case here.

After so many bad movies in this year's festival, I really wanted this one to be better - and for the most part, it was.  But, as it sputters out of gas in the end, I couldn't help but be disappointed.  Still, while it will never be remembered as a classic of the genre, it is certainly the most fun you'll have of the 8 films this year.",1255132800,7,4493,4.407272727272727
3744573,5,B001P9N93U,"Okey, so some friends & I decided to watch a marathon of hospital-based horror movies to celebrate the 3ed anniversary of Grant Morrison's makeover of the Joker from DC comics from a socipathic gun-weilding jester into a psychopathic knife-weilding surgeon.

Autopsy was agreeably a favorite among us, wheres another After Dark Horrorfest movie called Unrest was the low point.

Autopsy is pretty much everything you could want in a hospital-based horror movie. It has crazy people wandering around like zombies, lots of gore, & the teenagers who get picked off one-by-one are easily hatable so you really don't feel sorry for them.

As the cliche of 90% of horror movies goes, the lead actress barely escapes with her life, but enjoyably it has the end twist similar to Hostal 2 & Catacombs where the girl is pushed to breaking point & she completely snaps, becoming the most deadly thing in the movie. Naturally you just can't hate her anymore when she finally develops a back-bone & stands up for herself, making her into a true herione instead of a delicate & cowardly maiden.

3744574,1,B001P9N93U,"I laughed in looking through the reviews of this earlier, because someone said ""this is not as bad as some 'wannabe critics' make it out to be""...so I guess that means this guy is a professional critic, or he lied when answering the question ""are you over 13?""

Let's see, this film opens with lots of loud rock music, some 20-somethings at Mardi Gras  drinking lots of alcohol & smoking lots of dope, and then, oh wow, man, they have a car wreck?  They hit a tree?  But, I guess they also hit some guy that's under the car too, someone that some orderlies at the local hospital have been looking for, and since these young folk seemed to be a bit banged-up too, they get to go along for the ride back to the hospital.  Which is, of course, almost empty, and perhaps things aren't quite what they seem?

Of course, things are NOT what they seem, otherwise we'd have no movie. (and that would have been bad because..?)  One by one, our poor little 20-somethings head off to the exam rooms and never come back.  Kindly and benevolent Dr. Robert Patrick is taking good care of them, but he may have an ulterior motive or two.

This film, for being made in what is supposed to be an almost-abandoned hospital, is surprisingly lacking in any sort of atmosphere or suspense.  Never have gore & insane medical experiments been so boring.  I have no idea what the appeal of this film might be, because while it does seem to contain all the elements that would MAKE a fairly decent horror film, they just kind of lie there, not doing anything.  So what that leaves is your basic ""paint by the numbers"" film, which some people seem to feel is just great, but perhaps they haven't seen anything REALLY worthwhile before.

Gore Scenes:
A girl has the back of her head carved out like a Halloween pumpkin.
Victims chests are sliced open and all the organs are suspended in little hammocks above them.  The fluids from these organs are fed through tubes into and then administered intravenously to a living corpse in the next room. One of the tubes contains a yellow fluid.  Urine maybe?
A girl has a lumbar puncture.
A nurse has her arm severed by a meat cleaver.
Arms and legs are carted through the hallways.
A student having taken a powerful drug soon begins hallucinating and begins carving his forearm to resemble tic-tac-toe.

Illogical and just plain weird and dumb scenes:

The girl who had the back of her head carved-out can sit up and blink her eyes.
The victims whos' chest cavitys are opened with organs removed are hooked up to life support and still carry on conversations.  When a girl finds her boyfriend in this condition, they actually talk about how they fell in love.
When the girl has fluid extracted from her spine the looney doctor fills a small container with it and drinks most of it and says ""MMMM- just right"".

3744579,2,B001P9N93U,"What happens when the person you entrust with your medical care wants to perform a little involuntary surgery? That question is at the heart of Autopsy a slasher-by-numbers entry into the horror genre by director Adam Gierasch. Even more appalling than the film itself is the fact that this is the same guy that wrote Mother of Tears.

Autopsy concerns a group of friends who get completely wasted in New Orleans for one reason or another. They decide to do a little drunk driving (because nothing endears a group of twenty-somethings to a movie-going audience more than drunk driving) and end up in a hospital run by Dr. David Benway (Robert Patrick, the only good thing about this movie). Things seem out of the ordinary. People die. Yadda yadda yadda.

Gierasch wrote an Argento movie? Really? Did he write the script for Autopsy on the toilet? I can't' think of a single thing in this movie that I haven't seen before. Barely developed characters that die early in the film? Check. Characters that ignore incredible strange circumstances? Check. Inept law enforcement? Check. If it seems like I've written a review like this before, it's because I've seen a movie like this before. The kills aren't even worth watching. Imagine that: a slasher film with boring kills. One sequence in particular - involving a person's internal organs being positioned on the outside - was ripped straight from Event Horizon, and it was done with more style there. You know a movie's bad when Paul W.S. Anderson can pull off a better directing job.

The performances, for the most part, are phoned in. I'm guessing that the casting department chose actors that looked creepy without first checking if they could act the part. One of the orderlies has some odd neck tattoos. That's not scary in and of itself.  The head nurse is an elderly, plump woman trying to channel the nurse from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. She doesn't succeed. The only one who turned in a halfway decent perfomance was - surprise, surprise - Patrick, who has shown time and again, in movies like Terminator 2 and The Faculty, that he can play a convincing villain. I mean, you have to love a guy who does an unnecessary lumbar puncture then tastes the fluid to see if it's ""perfect.""

Jessica Lowndes tries her hardest to be a great final girl, but she ends up being more hollow than hero. We learn early in the film that she dropped out of medical school. By the film's end, she's ready to be a doctor. Yeah, I'm not buying it. The whole thing just reeks of ""we forgot to develop this character so we're going to shoehorn in some growth at the end of the movie.""

I guess I'm just not feeling the ""8 Films to Die For"" festival from last year. Last Reel and Perkins' 14 weren't even worth finishing, let alone writing a review about.

The story is typical slasher fare: a group of hard partying friends coming back from Mardi Gras wreck their car, and wind up at a creepy clinic run by the strange Dr. Benway (played by Robert Patrick, William S.

8332705,1,B001P9N93U,"I'm thinking some of the reviews are rigged, because this was NOT good.  However, it was predictable, done before (but done with a better budget, more believable effects and a better story line) and I just could not watch the entire thing.",1491955200,,239,4.690476190476191
8332706,3,B001P9N93U,"This proved to be an ok creepy movie. Deserted hospitals are scary anyway much less with the gore fest that went on there. Plenty of blood, guts, gore, and F bombs if you're into that kind of thing. Wouldn't watch again that's for sure. Just wasn't that great.",1490400000,,260,4.4375

2.5 stars. Rounded up to 3 because Amazon.",1488758400,,297,5.319148936170213
