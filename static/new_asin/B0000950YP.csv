7989989,4,B0000950YP,i actually liked this dvd quite well. i believe it would be great for people who are not quite serious students of yoga. it could just be fun. what in the world is wrong with fun stretches? nothing.,1441843200,,198,4.2368421052631575
7989990,5,B0000950YP,yogacize does stink and I would give it negative stars if I could.  However the 5 star rating is for Back in Action...it is the best workout for back pain that I have ever seen and I have tried at least a dozen others.,1435536000,,218,3.9545454545454546
7989991,1,B0000950YP,Not a keeper.  Do not be fooled by the cover; both sides of the dvd appear to be from the 1980's.,1273363200,,97,3.619047619047619
