8214244,5,B000UPGQQ2,My niece loves to play.  Only problem is she doesn't like to use the 2 players option.  She thinks it should always be her turn.,1496534400,,128,4.08
8214245,5,B000UPGQQ2,"This is a fun game!  I thought it was the ""best of the TV show,"" and this DVD game arrived instead!

It's a great game played with the DVD remote!",1489104000,,146,3.8333333333333335
8214246,5,B000UPGQQ2,Hours of fun for everyone. My family loves it and sometimes takes it a bit too seriously and someone has to remind us it's just pretend and you're not really winning or losing money. Great buy at a great price. Definitely worth it.,1429574400,,231,4.395348837209302

8214249,2,B000UPGQQ2,"I love the show and was super excited to play this with my family. I have got to say, I have never been so bored in my entire life. It was horrible. Each person taking turns picking their numbers with the DVD remote was tiresome and if you ever have trouble getting to sleep, just play this game. You'll be crashed out in no time.",1253923200,,330,4.092307692307692
8214250,1,B000UPGQQ2,This game was a complete waste of money!!!  It is nothing like the show.  Instead of seeing all the cases and then being able to choose the one you want to open you only get to see one casethat takes up the whole screen and you push up or down and then the number on the case changes.  RIP OFF!!!  HORRIBLE!!!!,1252022400,,310,4.032786885245901

8214252,5,B000UPGQQ2,WE've had lots of fun with this game. The opening of the cases are a bit slow but builds excitment like the real game. FUN FUN FUN,1202428800,6,130,3.8518518518518516
8214253,5,B000UPGQQ2,"The DVD game of Deal or No Deal is pretty good.  Growing up with old Nintendo games, I'm really amazed how realistic some of the things in this game are.  First of all, you should know Howie Mandel moves around on stage, exactly how he does on the TV show, and will frequently ask you the same questions he asks the contestants.  He asks YOU questions, and pretends like YOU are the contestant.  It's really spectacular if you love the TV show just how close to the *real* thing the game is.

You select the numbered cases by pressing the up, down, left or right buttons on your DVD player remote, and hit the OK button to select.  It's really that simple.  It's much easier than anything I've ever done before.  The very second you put the game inside the DVD player, it starts up immediately.  I can't believe how simple it is!

I can't think of anything to complain about.  When you select a case, you are treated to many funny lines from Howie himself, looking into the camera and straight at you.  They even show the banker (well, a shadow figure that is, haha).  After you select six cases in the first round, you are of course given a bank amount, and immediately after that you are given an option if you want to make it a deal, or no deal.

The only disappointing thing is they don't show the models faces when you're opening up the cases.  Other than that, absolutely no other complaints.  Great game.  One or two player action.",1198627200,18,1438,4.386363636363637
