7046565,5,B00UJH1UW6,"this is my all-time favorite movie...the DICEMAN is absolutely hilarious in this feature film.....although this was his only mainstream movie and because of all the boycotts and backlash he received at the time he truly has some hardcore,diehard fans,and I am absolutely one of them...he is a very underrated actor and if given the chance I think he would surprise a lot of people with his acting skills...granted,his humor isn't for everybody but to his fans they think he is hysterical as do I...I will continue to go to his concerts,buy his cd's,watch any new movies he is in and just support his talent.....this BLURAY is of amazing quality with sound and picture...I love it.",1430697600,4,680,4.921739130434783

7046575,5,B00UJH1UW6,"What can I say? I grew up listening to Dice and love his brand of humor. Much of his comedy is quite sexist and a little racist but it was back in a time when people had a sense of humor. And if you take it as it actually is in it's ridiculousness, then you can just laugh and enjoy. The Ford Fairlane character is almost exactly like his stage persona and the cast of celebrities is HUGE for a non mainstream comedy. If you enjoy the Dice comedian then you absolutely will love this movie. One of my all time favorites.",1502755200,,520,4.107843137254902

I originally had this on VHS and played it so many times it wore out.

I would not recommend it for younger viewers; but, that is your call.",1438041600,,269,4.0
7046630,5,B00UJH1UW6,"The Adventures of Ford Fairlane is a Film that was pretty much unjustifiably pulled and scrubbed from Theaters most due to Politically Correctness
and that was 25 years ago.... Strange how history repeats itself time and time again!
Andrew Dice Clay was the Biggest and one of the Over the top Rocker Style Comedian (The man was packing in Concepts venues) in late 80's early 90's.
That was unheard of at the time.
Yes there was another Gonzo Renegade Comedian known as Sam Kinison who too got major heat from various groups (woman, religious groups, etc.) BOTH Comedians are in many ways the same coin just one side is heads and the other side is tails
Terrible point I'm trying to make but, Hopefully it makes sense

Enough of my Horrid History lesson
This Film made a very strange impact on me mostly cause I seen very young maybe 10 years old or so (As soon as it hit the VHS Rental Market) My big brother rented it and my Mom let my little Sister and I watch it which looking back isn't terrible There is NO Nudity but, it's a hard ""R"" with lots of Mature themes and  language
But, from the first time i seen this flick I Loved it still to this day I love it (Have had every home video version of it) VHS, Laserdisc, dvd, & now Blu Ray
It's held up very good for it's time it's shot Beautifully (1/2 the film has these open outdoor scenes which you really don't see hardly at all now
You can see this same style in Films like The Night Before, Mystery Date, and The Warriors among others those come to mind
I think the biggest thing that ages this film would be Tone Loc (mostly due to the fact his Hip Hop Sound was very late 80's)
there is a lot of color to everything
Director Renny Harlin did a great job it has this odd 1970's feel at times but, flushed out with lots of life
The Cast is really strong for a Comedy\Action Hybrid
Andrew Dice Clay really isn't acting besides being the ""Dice"" Character Ford Fairlane was wrote for Clay I can't help but, wonder if it was called The Adventures of Andrew Dice Clay would it  still caught major heat..... Stupid question without a doubt Dice name being attached to it Did the film in

Wayne Newton steals every scene he's in....  Julian Grendel is such a Legit real Record executive he is sleazy and down right evil and Newton's performance makes it all the real (On paper you might think to yourself Wayne Newton playing a villain sounds stupid It's Not I'm shocked he took this role 'Cause it's so 180 and different in 1990 it was very bold and took b@lls on his part! He went all the way and pulled no punches

Priscilla Presley much like Newton sounds like a odd Choice but, she too does a great job She looks super attractive a Real MILF before that was even coined..... Her taking this gig was very brave of her as well She was Elvis's bloody wife and she's doing a hard rated R film with Andrew Dice Clay headlining!
This ain't no Naked Gun

Lauren Holly i understand went on to do lots more IMO this is one of her best Film performances she has this odd Brigitte Nielsen  spike hair thing going on but, she looks very hot and she's very likable

Gilbert Gottfried as the LA Shock Jock was a great casting choice (Howard Stern has made comments in the past that role was offered to him but, he was to good for a National Big Budget Film??? But, doing a Phony Gong Show rip-off is ok,,???)  Gilbert is great in the scenes he are in especially on VHS Tape ""Collie & Me"" and No it's not Lassie episode

 David Patrick Kelly as Sam the Pussycat Stalker is such a utter waste of a Great Character Actor IMO  (Hopefully he got payed good)

Robert Englund as ""Smiley"" simply awesome people love him as Freddy Kruger but, Good Lord he's just so slick and great as this villain between the  accident &  dialogue  one insanely great line is during the Chase through the Cemetery (Ford & Smiley are on the phone! Ford apologizes for taking another call and tells Smiley sorry that was my assistant Smiley's reply ""You're assistant is very special to you I look forward to Raping her at your funeral"" that line of dialog is both Dark & Funny i honestly doubt you could get away with that now! I'm not saying rape is in no way funny But, that scene is just crazy
and you can't forget  Ed O'Neill during the height of his run on Married w/ Children  (while he is in maybe 10min. of screen time at Best there are very funny HQ 10min.  as Lt. Amos) Terrible name mostly written for the joke I'm sure
 Interesting small parts Cameos
Sheila E.,  Vince Neil,
William Shockley name might not sound familiar he's that guy once you see his face you'll recognize (Robocop & Showergirls among lots more)
 a very young (maybe pre-mtv)  Kari Wuhrer,
Pamela Adlon (who has a very small cameo as one of the Pussycats) she would go onto Co-Staring on HBO's Lucky Louie  & FX's Louie along with massive V/O work from King of the Hill to Bob's Burgers and everything in between..... Pamela's live action work is also very impressive she's been around and IMO still very under-rated

The Story: It's pretty much a Classic P.I. Film set in a modern day  The twist with a dirty talking private d! ck
who smokes like a chimney and has a hidden gun in his leather jacket! Plus he loves Girl Scouts and 15min. in buys two boxes
the story isn't perfect but, everything moves as a lighting pace  (The Set peaces set up jokes and dialogue)
it starts off simple he needs to  find his old friends  long lost ""daughter""  but, the black plaque bleeds into a very simple case
Or is it??? There's a lot more to everything then just a Lost Girl and Ford must solve the case cause he's broke due to the fact being a Rock & Roll Detective doesn't pay all that good unless you want Gifts......
Trust me when I tell you it's 101 min. and the time will fly by unless you are easily Offended by Grown-up Adult Humor
A Key to this film is all the insane over the top moments this little bomb provides
I've seen this film at Least 50x's i know lines of Dialogue by heart and the same gags-jokes make me laugh Cause everything works
the film is being Narrated by Dice or Ford whatever
The opening is after the events of the previous Night and it starts out sounding basic (common) for a Narration then he says he wants the entire World to Suck His D!ck Tracey.... after that it will dawn on you this ain't Humphrey Bogart Detective Flick this is Crazy!
The scene where Ford goes to met his old friend Johnny Crunch at the Radio Station he gets his hand slammed into the reception desk (with this chick who has the strangest hair.... her dialogue is simple but, it works Johnny has hundreds of fans that hate his guts
The Scene where Ford is on Johnny Boat  (The Mighty Penis) he hits the lights and it's this sleazy boat with sex toys and blow up dolls and Dice starts singing the theme to the love boat during the very scene Ford comes across a VHS Tape that labeled  ""Collie & Me"" his  narration is flat out funny ""I''m a Huge Lassie Fan I figured I'd take a break I hope it's the one where"" that the S&M tape plays
One of the best action scenes of the 90's is the Cemetery Chase scene it's just so unique and different (I wish it was longer But, then maybe it wouldn't be so good) I've seen alot of films in my life I have only seen a Chase scene in a cemetery once!  and it's In this film
youtube the scene if you wanna know what i mean,
Trying to explain that scene will Not give it justice

Onto my thoughts on the Blu Ray Review
Anchor Bay still makes Blu Ray Disc???
Anchor Bay (During the Craze of DVD's were Kings they put, time and quality into there Stuff w/ extras and HQ Audio Tracks
Fast Forward to the Blu Ray Format and they are a shell of there former self
They really don't care almost all there top Notch Horror Titles have been snatched up by other Companies
@ the start of BR's they were much better putting out HQ Transfers of Halloween, Day of the Dead & Dawn of the Dead  (Then after a few years all that faded away) Anchor Bay know does these weird FOX Studio Back Catalog titles w/out any of the great Special Features
the Bedazzled (2000) Re-make comes to mind the BR is bare while the DVD has a lot of cool extras including a audio commentary with the late  Harold Ramis!
Anchor Bay doing Blu Ray's is a mixed bag cause you'll get pretty good HD Transfers but, that's it the Anchor Bay of 1999 would've never tried to get away with that!! They'll spend lots of Money for silly Limited Editions of the Walking Dead (w/ Gimmicky Zombie Heads) But, we can't get the Ultimate Dawn of the Dead Collection on Blu Ray.......
This Fox BR Transfer too is bare bones (The dvd has a Audio Commentary with Director, ""Making of Featurette, Billy Idol's Cradle of Love Promo Video and Theatrical Trailer ) The Adventures of Ford Fairlane Blu ray only has the trailer
The PQ is actually impressive (the dvd always looked Cheap the Laserdisc looked better then the dvd) but, that being said if you are a huge fan like myself keep the DVD for the extras
My biggest problem with the blu ray is the audio
My copy was decoded wrong or something the audio and dialog are off by second or two at first i didn't notice then after 10min of  film something was off It's the sound Just like the poor rush Job Anchor Bay did with the Halloween 4  (The Copy in the Deluxe Box Set has this same prob. but, not all the way through the film at least and AB actually sent replacements for that disc I guess if you spend $120.00 plus you should back up quality
This disc on the other hand has been impossible to get a Replacement! Never heard boo from them never got any type of  reply back from them concerning this jacked-up disc.... Lost what little Respect i had for anchor bay at this point
If you plan on getting this BR be warned watch it or least Check out the audio asap (That way you can at least send it back to Amazon and get a replacement) Stupid me had faith that Anchor Bay would  do me a solid which they did a number of times with there dvd's
now not so much unless you spend over $100.00

It has a 6.2 on IMDB which seems way to low  without a doube a solid 8.5/10
I love this flick so much 20 years ago i was lucky enough to come across a used cd soundtrack to this film (It's awesome) Now very Rare and Out of Print If you love this film and are lucky enough to find this cd for a god price grab it..... It's better then you'd think it would be",1437264000,8,10366,4.253435114503817

7046638,3,B00UJH1UW6,"You've got to have the ""taste"" for Andrew Dice Clay, in this breakout film which brought him some good publicity.  It's basically a film one can only take in small doses, but I also have to admit, he made me break up during a couple of scenes which I didn't expect to see.  It's simply a fun way to kill 90 minutes.  There's not much else to say.

So I preordered the bluray thinking get it's an upgrade. But it really isn't for one there are no special features which I hoped there might be some like music videos or something but there isn't. But what really annoys me is when I went to watch it I noticed they actually cut a number of things out. Now I have seen this movie well over 20 times and know when something is missing. They cut a full 3 minutes out of the original movie! I know that doesn't seem like much but to me that's three minutes where I am left missing those cut lines and scene sections, which makes me miss my DVD copy.",1432252800,,769,4.032679738562091
7046645,5,B00UJH1UW6,"One of my favorite movies on blu ray. Andrew Dice Clay, the 80s all on one disc. Quality could be better. But it still a 5 star movie. Waiting for the next  adventure of Ford.",1432080000,,175,4.0
7046646,5,B00UJH1UW6,"I was never much a fan of Andrew Dice Clays stand up routine but I LOVE this movie. It came out when I was 12 and I think that was the perfect age to see it. This, along with Total Recall, were some of the last bastions of entertainment marketed to adults, filled with gratuitous sex, violence and swearing.

 If you were to admit you like this movie in polite society today feminists, gays and white guilt liberals would cut your balls off and regard you like a leper. I myself am a lefty liberal type but unlike those delusional hand holding, kumbaya singing bastards, I know that people deep down love violent and despicable filth but would never admit it. Dont kid yourself, society today isn't less violent, sexist, racist or homophobic, people are just better at hiding it.

 So let us revel in our inner knuckle dragger and show some love for The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. Apart from the sex, violence and un-PC humor, there is Lauren Holly looking insanely hot! Renny Harlan coming off A Nightmare on Elm Street 4, bringing with him Freddy Kruger himself, Robert Englund, as a Cockney hitman. Filling out the rest of the cast are Priscilla Presley and Wayne Newton as the bad guy not to mention Gilbert Gottfried, David Patrick Kelly and Ed ONeill along with Kari Wuher and Pamela Adlon in early roles.

 Trivia note; the twin sisters that Fairlane bangs at the beginning of the film also starred together in the first episode of Freddys Nightmares with Englund. Also, Cindy Lehres greatest claim to fame (apart from playing Lydia, the girl in the hearse) was performing in Young MCs 1989 music video for Bust a Move where she has STOP signs on her ass and delivers the songs chorus of You want it, you got it.

The Bluray itself is an insult. 20th Century Fox couldn't even be bothered to port over the extras from the DVD. There isn't even a menu for this movie which I've NEVER heard of. Put the disc in and the film stars playing. That's how little respect this movies gets. The Adventures of Ford Fairlane is a cult classic and should have had at least a little love and care put into its 25th anniversary Bluray debut. The one good thing I can say is that the picture quality is fantastic. You have to remember that many of the indoor scene's were shot using smoke to diffuse the lighting which is why it sometimes looks hazy, giving it that MTV music video look, appropriate given the subject matter, while the outdoor scene's are razor sharp.

But, yeah, even back in 1990 people thumbed their noses at this flick because it offended their delicate sensibilities while the release of Nirvana's Nevermind a year later would kill the hair metal bands of the 80's and rendered Ford Fairlane into a time capsule of the end of that era. But that's one of the many reasons why I adore this film. If you're a fan of the movie I suggest checking out The Projection Booth's podcast dedicated to The Adventures of Ford Fairlane where they interview Rex Weiner, who wrote the original stories the movie was based on, as well as Daniel Waters who was one of the films credited screenwriters.",1431734400,4,3098,4.559352517985611

8707101,5,B00UJH1UW6,"Best Andrew Dice Clay movie, so UN-PC its great, no way could it be made today, your PC crowd would go crazy. Dice sets the Mood of the movie right at the beginning when a Girl asks for his number and he gives ""555"" prefix number and she says, ""hey that's not real its only in the movies"", he answers back, ""No Sh_t honey what you think this is"", right there!! its the actor, writer and director telling the audience, please this is not serious at all, roll with the ""over the top movie"", sit back and enjoy for laughs, thats all it is..... Crazy Funny Stuff like.... you Suzuki Samurai, Stanley, ZuZu Peddles, You gotta shave when you wear something like that. The Villian is Robert Englund""Freddie Kruger"", come on, its just a popcorn movie, so glad I could get it on Blu ray. One thing missing is no extras, my previous DVD had a nice behind the scenes documentary on it.",1512950400,4,874,4.368098159509202
8707102,5,B00UJH1UW6,Hilarious. Had not seen this motion picture since it was in theaters. I was afraid it would be campy or cheesy after all these years but it actually aged well with time. Fairly well developed plot with the occasional bit of cheese but nothing cringe inducing. And the comic relief bits were right on cue and actually hold up to todays ''standards''.Presley looks gorgeous in this..get it!,1511481600,,388,4.8059701492537314
