790725,5,630410605X,"I was lucky enough to see this film on the big screen when it was released. It is very unfortunate that this movie did not achieve the box-office success that it deserved. Jeff Bridges gives a strong  performance(does he ever give less) in a role that is not as large as one  might predict. Everyone else surrounding him on the ship gives strong  performances as well. This film was based on a true story, and is never  boring and is always beautiful to look at. Not to mention a beautiful and  amazing score that fits the mood and setting perfectly. This movie has  everything that a great film should. Ridley Scott impresses once again.

790726,3,630410605X,"With classics like Alien, Blade Runner and the underrated but superb 1492: Conquest of Paradise, I'm a huge Ridley Scott fan. White Squall is a disappointment by comparison, but is still a compulsive and entertaining  rite of passage drama that should not be overlooked and certainly deserved  better than its disastrous performance at the box office. The film's main  flaw is that it all too closely resembles Dead Poets' Society, (especially  the coda, which copies Oh Captain, My Captain) Unusual for a director who  usually sets the standards for others to follow rather, than the other way  round. However all this is partly made up by the excellent performances  from a talent set of youngsters and the ever-solid Jeff Bridges who at  first resembles a Captain Ahabesque clich but finally exudes sympathy.  Scott's stunning visuals are present and correct and the sequences at sea  truly convey the power of the sea, even in calm weather, as Scott revels in  the rolling of the waves, lurching the ship up and down, like no other  film. The breathtaking storm of the title stands out not only as a  technical tour de force but also as an intense and moving climax.",948499200,12,1170,4.848484848484849

But even that act  alone could not save this movie. And who is this Ryan Phillipe character  anyways?  Every movie i see him in is just plain awful.  I call it the Ryan  Phillipe curse.

791312,3,630410605X,"Released in early 1996 and directed by Ridley Scott, White Squall is a drama/adventure based on a true story about a group of American teenage boys who crew a sailing ship and discover discipline, adventure, courage, camaraderie, babes and the worst this world has to offer. Jeff Bridges stars as the captain, Caroline Goodall as his physician wife, John Savage as a teacher and Julio Oscar Mechoso as the cook. The main protagonist and narrator, Chuck Gieg, is played by Chris Wolf. Other teens are played by Ryan Phillippe, Jeremy Sisto, et al. (Id name more but they're mostly so nondescript I cant remember em).

While White Squall tries to be Dead Poets Society on the high seas it somehow doesnt click like that movie and is therefore a mixed bag, which explains why it bombed at the box office. I love the adventure-on-a-sailing-ship plot and there are some bright spots, but the script has a hard time pulling you into the story; and the characters and their situations are often too contrived to be engaging. The Shakespeare-spouting English teacher is a good example, not to mention practically any scene involving the boys. I know the screenplay was based on Chuck Giegs book, but the producers needed a screenwriter with a creative spark who knew how to write compelling drama, like Tom Schulman.

The best part of the movie is the titular storm and the shocking events thereof, which effectively perks the movie out of the general doldrums of the first two acts. Unfortunately, this thrilling sequence is a bit marred by the artificial melodramatics of the closing court room scene. The bell-ringing part is particularly eye-rolling (which is in contrast to the potent O Captain! My Captain! scene in Dead Poets). Nonetheless, White Squall is worth checking out if you enjoy adventure-on-the-high-seas, with the storm sequence being worth the price of admission.

The movie runs 129 minutes and was shot in Malta, Bermuda, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, South Africa, South Carolina, Georgia and England.

791570,2,630410605X,"It may have been based on a true story but the screenwriter got much of his/her geography wrong. For the captain to announce that they'll sail through ""fog that will hide the reefs and rocks"" when you are taking a tropical sail from Caribbean through Panama Canal then to Galapagos Islands is incorrect. No fog in the Tropics. Plus, you don't sail south and then west past Grenada to end up adjacent Cuba. The Cuban warship showing up as they left Grenada made the movie laughable to me. I also hate the propaganda of stereotyping Hispanics as stupid and mean. That there was fog in the tropical scene before the squall was ludicrous. It's no wonder most Americans are afraid of sailing after watching these Hollywood movies that play to our base fears and are ridiculously inaccurate in Iheir portrayal. Two good recent movies are Robert Redford's movie about a lone sailor in the Indian Ocean whose vessel strikes a freight carton floating just below the surface and Kevin Spacey's ""Captain Phillips"". As a sailor and cruiser, those were two movies that were well produced and accurate in their portrayal of life within the marine world.",1450742400,,1139,4.816326530612245

This movie is based on a true story. Jeff Bridges was really convincing as the Captain of the Yacht, Albatross. He really believed this long cruise would help to build the character and unity of these young boys and that they would remember this cruise the rest of their lives. The Bluray transfer on this movie was of very good quality. Looks much better than the DVD of this same movie I had. The DVD looks a little dark in most scenes and this Bluray does not.

791708,5,630410605X,"White Squall is a coming of age story for a group of boys/young men who sign up for a semester at sea on a working ship where they themselves will be doing the working, bonding together and becoming the crew. They are under the command of ship's captain Christopher Shelton (Jeff Bridges) who is assisted by his wife, Dr. Alice Shelton (Caroline Goodall), and English Teacher McCrea (John Savage). Some of the boys have been enrolled for disciplinary reasons, others just want to experience something different. There are conflicts, small adventures and mildly comic scenes and one great crisis. It is a very moving story, one that can completely absorb you if you let it.

White Squall was directed by Ridley Scott, known for his meticulously shot visuals since his first feature film, The Duellists (1977) and follow ups like Alien and Blade Runner. The visuals, especially of the ship sailing through the waves and a sunny day hike by the crew are stunning. The film was not a big success in its day. Being released in February is not the best time for a film like this, February being almost a dumping ground by studios for films they don't know how to market. I feel that by 1996, the year when Independence Day was the top film, an adventure film set entirely within a normal human scale was seen as old-fashioned, and if there weren't mega special effects and the entire planet at stake many moviegoers were no longer interested. White Squall, though an adventure film, is really about the characters' relationships and never becomes an action film, to the disappointment of others. Some actually complained that the young actors were too good looking, but though they have the good looks of youth, they never seem to be a bunch of male models, and usually athletic boys would be drawn to such a voyage.

The ending is also somewhat controversial and I am one of those who thinks it could have been better if handled differently. I won't go into particulars but for me the film reaches almost mythological heights and the final scenes, while tying up loose ends effectively, bring the film down to a very mundane level . But that's not enough to derail this magnificent film. Sting singing ""Valparaiso"" over a flashback to the high point of the film and the end credits is remarkably effective.",1442707200,2,2301,4.75

791813,1,630410605X,"Camelot sets sail, then sinks------in a ""white squall"", November 8, 2000

In 1960, America was imbued with a we-can-do-anything humanistic spirit of its new President, John F. Kennnedy, America was prosperous materially, but uneasy that it was not as strong as it once was in WWII to meet the threat of global communism. Certainly this film is ""Dead Poets Society"" afloat before it sinks, and this is the critical difference. Director Ridley Scott makes you wonder if he's using films to work out his own internal struggles in his head, and reality rescues him here because the events are based on a true story, so if Scott doesn't get the message, he at least depicts it and its then up to us to get it.

Something marvelous happens even though its terrible--that delivers the message, and that is the white squall storm that sinks the ship and kills several people you don't want to see die. This is what sets this film apart from make-believe scenarios like Dead Poets, because those folks are never in DANGER. These folks put their idealism to the test of the real world, requiring REAL courage. The angst of never-having-fully-lived by America's pampered in Poets smacks of trite self-indulgence, in this movie this Kennedy-era idealism runs smack into reality. President Teddy Roosevelt warned us as we grew pampered and at ease from industrial-age labor saving devices that we would stuill have to challenge ourseles physically, so he insured the natural state of the american west was conserved for us to explore. In this film, the sailing ship is a similar ""retro-challenge"" to build character, complete with a young idealistic character from the TV show ""Party of Five"" who looks like a young Kennedy in a sailing ship in several scenes. By teaching the boys to respect the sea and the ship, they will learn to respect each other.

The trouble with Camelot--is its self-indulgent idealism, not practical idealism, so the efforts of the boys to become men are spent on a flight of fancy in a dangerous sailing ship when we have much more sea-worthy vessels available and meaningful tasks to do, not just tasks required as Jeff Bridges' skipper warns from the beginning are required to ""keep the ship together"". The conflict in the film is the conflict of materialistic, pampered America to produce sturdy men who can face the storms of real life; the parents in the film sense this and are torn between safety and the need to take reasonable risks, and the boys themselves think there has to be ""a better way"". The point of the film is NOT to ""throw caution into the wind"" counting on humanistic hubris but to take every precaution possible so you can set sail by the ""wind""--a metaphor for life's forces--and live to see another day.

But along the way, there are warnings that all is not well. Offshore near Cuba, a communist gunboat shoots across the ship's bow and boards the boat. Bridges stands up to the commie and sends him on his way, though his compass is smashed and he must use his humanistic skills to pilot the ship...while over the horizon the ships of the ill-fated ""Bay of Pigs"" amphibious invasion appear....a foreshadowing of another ""Camelot"" type enterprise ready to hit a wall of harsh reality..days later as America is sending its first astronaut into space heard over the radio, the weather worsens...

Now that the boys who are now more mature, young men, most would expect a return home in a happy ending, but the storm hits and they lose the ship and some very fine people. Then in typical American fashion, we hold a court-room trial or a hearing to pin the blame on a ""scapegoat"" rather than face the truth that its our own mentality that is at fault. That scapegoat is the Skipper and his judgments when it should be the soundness of the entire sailing-ship-as-retro-character-builder-for-teenage-boys-in-an-unforgiving-environment-of-the-sea. Full grown MEN die at sea in much larger, more seaworthy vessels. A similar tragic ending took place later by unrealistically wishing 7-year old Jessica Dubroff to pilot an airplane across the U.S. Even with the best humanism, the skipper loses the ship and his lovely wife, several staff and boys to the sea. He is devastated. Is his idealism destroyed for good? Jeff Bridges in the courtroom says that control and the ship ""got away from him"" and ""he didn't see it coming""-----humanistic hubris will do that to you. This is exactly what took place with JFK and his Camelot humanism (phrase coined by his wife Jackie, afterwards): it ran head first into failures caused by unrealistic planning/preparations at the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban missile crisis and the conspiracy of gunmen at Dealey Plaza. It continued with RFK throwing ""caution into the wind"" and not having adequate security in place before he too, was gunned down.

The surviving boys rally to the Skipper's side in the end, reminding him that in life we have to band together during the hour of crisis, that sometimes in life you have to ""take your lumps"" and ""drive on"". The film suggests this fatalism should be accepted, I disagree. We should accept that its a possibility that the elements might get the better of us, but to do EVERYTHING IN OUR MEANS TO DEFEAT them, to include---but not over-depend on---human skill and have the HUMILITY to also use technology to help overcome the elements. That's what men do if we are going to make headway in this dangerous, challenging world we live in eloquently told by the Party of Five actor at film's end, and foretold earlier by Alan Shepherd's space capsule spotted by the boys in their lifeboats. But that's not what happens in America, lately every time we ""fall off a horse"", we ""wash our hands of it"" in a senate hearing or a courtroom (Vietnam, Beirut, Somalia...) and then vow to never ""get back on"", LEARNING HOW TO DO IT BETTER---Not more humanistic hubris but PHYSICAL means; life jackets, more bouyant sailing ships, better self-righting life boats, navigation/weather aids, recovery parachutes to prevent Jessica Dubroff-type aircraft crashes etc., This propensity to ""throw the towel in"" is how we drift from a nation of doers to a nation of talkers and computer game players. Jeff Bridges and his crew were trying to ""pass the torch"" of direct engagement of reality with high ideals, that he continued on to be one of the first Peace Corps Directors and the boys went to Vietnam and survived is testimony that their character didn't fail.

The director of the film seems confused about whether the message should be to accept idealism with fatalism or if idealism is non-functional in the world; the real message is to make idealism functional.",1438646400,2,6655,4.868490732568403

792311,5,630410605X,"This is a great movie. It is really action packed but is also packed with life lessons. The acting from ALL the cast is great, that includes the kids. The story is satisfying and not rushed, it's ending is satisfying in that there is a reasonable thorough one.  The photography is beautiful.

This is a story where young boys go to school while cruising on an actually operating boat. They are expected to be the crew as well as scholars. Jeff Bridges is the Captain of the ship and is the kind of man's man you want a young man to be exposed to and learn how to be a man from...so the third lesson plan on board, is how to be a man.

As you can imagine the boys on board have problems, one has had a brother die that he feels responsible for, one has an abusive father and he is twisted from this...and so on. So situations arise like courage, cruelty, honesty, responsibility, ego. Each is dealt with, you see modeled how to grow in each. So IF people are as smart as monkeys, and we learn like they do...""monkey see, monkey do"" then this should help boys or anyone watching this.

For young children this may be too intense...I am not sure if I would let a child less than 6 see this. I am undecided though, because so often our younger children are now seeing things in the media or their friends are telling them or showing them...and I think it is better for caregivers to control the situation and be ready and able to discuss it with their children so that WE know the spin that was put on the information and behaviors they saw.

Among some of the things they will see: a dolphin killed out of meanness, a frightening storm and death by drowning.",1409443200,,1655,4.291666666666667

Wow. I think some people who reviewed this movie completely missed the point. Maybe some misguided newspaper reviewer called it a ""coming of age"" movie and the moniker seemed to stick but no, this is not at all in the genre of ""coming of age"" movies that are shallow, vapid and forgettable. This movie is much better than that.

Let's start with the fact that this movie is based on real life events, not fantasies about high school boys getting their first score. Yes, the movie wouldn't be realistic if there wasn't a little bit of the boys eyeing the girls, but ""coming of age"" is a lot different concept than the wide breadth of life experience the young men in this movie are dealt and forced to cope with.

Most ""coming of age"" movies are farcical fantasies when held in comparison to White Squall.

Nor is this an action-adventure or even a romantic love story about young adults set in a historic situation (think Titanic).

Director Ridley Scott elicits such raw real life from his cast that you often forget you are watching a movie. The kids are often and usually more in control of the action than the adults. Starting with top-billed Jeff Bridges, who is by far not the lead character and whose performance often comes off as comical in the genre of Capt. Jack Sparrow. The real lead is the compelling John Savage who exhibits an amazing depth and breadth of acting ability, but whose on-camera demeanor is just shy of looking like he just showed up for work. Last on the list is Caroline Goodall who is wooden and remote throughout and when her time comes (for what seems to be a lingering eternity in which she stares blankly into the camera) who else here mumbled ""ho hum, seeya""?

While I knew very little about the plot of this movie, the words ""action packed"" screamed out at me in their promotion. To the contrary, this is NOT an action-packed movie. There are only two scenes that contain intense action, while the rest is quite sedate and low-key compared to any movie. If your intent is to see an ""action-packed"" movie I think you will be disappointed.

This is a highly underrated movie that has been undeservedly been given low reviews by people who were just not watching the same movie as me. Watch it again! Understand that it is not just about a bunch of horny teens who are ""coming of age"". Watch it more for than most other movie's share of acting brilliance.

While I won't let it affect my rating, there is one particular scene that troubled me. You'll know it when you see it. If the movie had been pure fiction I would have been furious. But knowing that it was based on real life I'll accept it as portraying reality, but I have to add my two cents that the presentation of that scene, although realistically raw, could have been treated just a little differently.

Finally, the actual DVD presentation. The wide-screen format is compelling and totally necessary to capture the rawness of the sea. The ratio is a good fit for current generation LCD TV's. The Blu-Ray transfer is mostly flawless - sharp, clear, color-correct, and with thundering dynamic surround sound. There is only one disc with only the shortest hint of a copyright notice at the beginning then right into the title menu. The only bonus track is the theatrical trailer (in standard definition).

I suggest you stop reading ABOUT this movie and just SEE it. If you let your mind get filled with too much misinformation you will end up sitting there waiting for things that just aren't going to happen.",1404086400,,3536,4.634185303514377

Review written by Peter Smith

Update for 11/19/2016 I just bought another copy of this movie, ""Starman and a bunch of other movies for my sister, and I am going to give it to her for her upcoming birthday this year and I know that she will really enjoy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",1375747200,,670,4.430894308943089

792744,5,630410605X,"I had fond memories of watching White Squall back when the channel Encore was available on my basic cable service. I watched the movie and found myself really understanding where each character was coming from, except for Francis maybe.

So when I told my girlfriend we should watch this together, I thought she was going to enjoy the movie as much as I did. I was wrong, she thought it was boring and didn't like it at all. The truth is, this movie is a coming of age movie for boys turning into men.

My girlfriend couldn't relate to the boys as much as I did. Each one of them had something to prove whether to themselves or to their parents. I think most men regardless of sexual orientation could relate to being on a ship, by yourselves, fending for yourselves, learning to leave behind your boyhood past.

The movie does jump around a bit, and there's definitely moments where you're like, ""Huh? Why did he do that?"" This is a case of where I mentally filled in the blanks and went along for the ride. I basically just imagined myself in the shoes of these boys and found myself pondering if I would have gone on an adventure with them.

But yeah, leave the girl at home if you're going to watch this one.",1374537600,,1212,4.373333333333333

793133,5,630410605X,"I bought this move years ago. And it has been a favorite of mine ever since. I have a passion for character development, especially in an age where character is so rare, like today. A story of innocence lost and manhood achieved. A story of lost life and of the birth of new life (euphemistically). A true story. And one that deserves to be told. And one that is as thrilling as it is entertaining.",1351900800,,398,4.32

Ridley Scott & Jeff Bridges - need I say more?  this film has been reviewed lots on here so I will just agree that Ryan Philippe did an incredible job in this film.  He is such a good actor; I think he's just made a lot of bad role choices.

It's a sensitive tale of coming of age for a group of young men, who experience a cataclysmic event with the captain of the ship they crew for the summer.  The film of that event will keep you from ship deck for quite a while.  It is arresting, thrilling and absolutely terrifying. In the movies, there can't have been too many more ever filmed with a more helpless scene.

The dolphin scene always did and still upsets me greatly, I must say.

Nevertheless, this a wonderful film, with unexpected twists and turns.  Glad I picked it up!",1350604800,,906,4.155172413793103

793136,5,630410605X,"Somehow this movie missed the critical acclaim it was justified in receiving. This movie is the quintessential coming of age film. But above all else it is a film that perfectly captures journey. Boys become men. Individuals become a community. Selfishness becomes sacrifice. Fear becomes courage.

Audio/video quality is not bad.  Given the price, this is about what I expected.

I do, of course, wish we could get some kind of (new) making of feature and a commentary by Ridley.  I never get tired of hearing that director talk about his films, regardless of how well I liked the film itself.  As for the film, I haven't had an opportunity yet to watch it.  I have only skipped around a bit to check out the disc.

The courtroom scene is particularly effective.

I assume that the movie was based on true events, but then it would be crazy to run a sailing ship with nearly no experienced adults.

One thing i didn't like was the overly long shipwreck scene, showing people trapped and drowning. I also skipped the killing of the porpoise.

All in all, a very commendable effort.",1340150400,,401,4.768115942028985

793142,4,630410605X,"Ridley Scott's WHITE SQUALL is one of the director's least successful box-office undertakings, yet a fairly well-received adventure-drama based on a true story. Scott Wolf stars as Chuck Geig, a Connecticut high school student circa 1960 who sets off on a sailing expedition from Florida with a group of other young men. Under the guidance of sage sailor Jeff Bridges, the boys learn the ropes of sailing and living in a series of rites-of-passage movie cliches - all before a harrowing, unique weather phenomena puts all of them to the test. This section of the picture offers some of Scott's strongest work, a legitimate ""Perfect Storm"" that's intense and horrifying (the actual ""micro burst"" of bad weather lasted for 90 seconds; in the movie, it's a nearly 20 minute, bravura set piece).

Although Todd Robinson's script doesn't offer many surprises - basically reworking ""Dead Poets Society"" and including a courtroom sequence that feels needlessly tacked on - the gorgeous Carribean locales are vividly captured by Scott and cinematographer Hugh Johnson, the performances by Bridges and Wolf capable, and the film highly entertaining.

""White Squall"" never received a proper 16:9 DVD release in the US, so Mill Creek's Blu-Ray presentation is especially welcome. The movie's cinematography is exponentially enhanced by the AVC encoded 1080p transfer, with DTS MA audio (sporting an okay score by Jeff Rona, who replaced Maurice Jarre) and the original trailer also offered as a bonus. One of Scott's more unheralded pictures, ""White Squall"" is certainly worth a look now that its visuals can finally be rendered in a proper home video release.",1338422400,6,1649,5.218867924528302
793295,5,630410605X,"For fans of Ridley Scott, of coming of age dramas, of great tales of action and adventure .  .  .this covers almost everyone. . .this is a wonderful and very underrated movie.  Beautifully filmed with great attention to detail, the story is based on the 'year on the sea' prep school my uncle, Christopher ""Kit"" Sheldon, operated in the early 1960's with his wife and tragic end this came to with the ""White Squall"" of the title.  Jeff Bridges plays Sheldon with the articulate, cool, disciplined stoicism the real man was known for. The teen crew do well with their roles, growing up in this difficult time and environment. The ship and storm both put in Oscar worthy performances.  Some of the details were hollywood-ized, like the naval court hearing, but it is nevertheless very close to what happened.",1334448000,,806,4.76978417266187

In addition to mastering sailing, the boys get ""book learnin'"" from two of the crew.  The cast is headed by Jeff Bridges as the skipper and Caroline Goodall as his wife, medical doctor and science teacher.  The ensemble also includes some young guns still making a name for themselves today, including Scott Wolf, Ryan Phillippe and Jeremy Sisto.  Wolf's character, Chuck Gieg is the subject of the book about this true story set in 1960.  He narrates the film and is the primary catalyst.  Early on we get the expected hijinks from the boys as well as seeing the usual diverse personalities.  You know the cool one, the mean one, the smart one, etc.  The second act turns more ominous.  First with a confrontation with a Cuban patrol boat (remember, this is 1960), then a serious storm that swamps and sinks the boat.  Director Ridley Scott pulls no punches in this well done scene.  The event has casualties and Capt. Sheldon is called before a commission investigating his competence.  ""White Squall"" is no masterpiece, but it serves and terrific entertainment.  It has great photography, good performances and an excellent score.",1317600000,3,1268,4.841860465116279

793300,5,630410605X,"When I saw this movie in the theaters, I was blown away with it.  As a merchant mariner, I can vouch for the realisticness of this movie.  Jeff Bridges gives a stellar performance and unfortunately the public did not receive it as such.  Jeff Bridges plays the captain of a ship that acts as a school for students to learn not only general studies, but the real school is when they are underway and sailing and then the white squall hits.  The ending is sad, but there is enough drama and adventure for everyone to enjoy throughout this picture.  David Selby (Quentin Collins from the early 70's soap Dark Shadows) plays one of Bridges students father who Bridges expelled because he killed a dolphin/mammel, and will stop at nothing to see that Bridges is dismissed as the captain of the school ship.  Ironically enough, Jeff Bridges is the ultimate star of this picture, but the kid who sees him as a great mentor (Scott Wolf) tells the story through his eyes and is very good.  There is also a small part for the boy's father who played Billy on the soap opera The Guiding Light.  This is one that really shows what it's like to be a mariner on the high seas.  My only wish is that they had one of these schools when I was in high school.  If you like action, adventure and great acting, this is the picture to see.

They meet Cuban gunboats, various phobias, conflict, STDs, and more.  The true story aspect is that they also run into a ""white squall,"" a sudden storm with powerful winds and waves that cause a disaster.

Initially, I had difficulty with the scenes of the boat in very rough water, juxtapositioned with shots from inside the boat and on its deck.  They clearly are not done under the same conditions; the rough seas portrayed (more than once) should have made walking and standing on deck more difficult.

Still, the experience could have been wonderful.  The result was tragedy.  Jeff Bridges, the captain, was a bit too stoic for my taste.",1293840000,,791,4.7299270072992705

This film was fantastic. I'm not a Jeff Bridges fan but, he was great in this film.

793396,3,630410605X,"I watched Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert review this Ridley Scott film. Ebert kept going on and on about how beautiful the boats looked and how extraordinary the storm sequences were. Siskel just listened and then said, ""So what?"" My sentiments exactly. What does one go to the movies for anyway, you'll have to ask yourself. Because if it's to see stunning visuals then ""White Squall"" is a must! But if you actually want something more than a screenplay hot off the Hollywood screenplay mass assembly line, then you can pass on this movie. All the cliched ingredients are there. This is basically one of those school boys yearn for adulthood and get taught the ropes on the high seas kind of deal. There is the underdog kid who comes through, there is the arrogant kid who gets taught a lesson and becomes less selfish, there is the skipper who teaches the youngsters and learns a thing or two about himself. I could go on and on. This screenplay seems like it was written by some dude straight out of college who has read every book on screenwriting ever published and decided that a great screenplay is all about how many formulas and cliches a writer can fit together into one movie.

A couple years ago I went through most of Ridley Scott's filmography because he is a one of a kind filmmaker who is all surface content. His style is flamboyant visual decadence, the kind that glossy advertisements are made of. In fact he was an ad man and directed many television ads including the famous ""1984"" Apple Macintosh commercial. He is a big-budget Hollywood director but since his visual style can be so overwhelming and identifiable, he is sometimes mistaken for an auteur, a genuine artist. He is not but he did hit a few home runs. ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" would be at the top of the list. But watch some of his strike out movies to learn more. Movies like ""Legend"" with Tom Cruise, ""Black Rain"" with Michael Douglas and here ""White Squall"" with Jeff Bridges. Astounding visual feasts with little heart or soul beneath the gleaming, glossy veener. This is a director who needs to feed off a strong screenplay because all of his ideas are visual in nature, he does not understand anything else about filmmaking. So when you have a strong screenplay like Blade Runner, you get a modern sci-fi film classic. When you have a lousy, assembly line screenply like White Squall, you get a two hour advertisement for boats and oceanic getaways.

The big climactic storm sequence is a stunning feat of production wizardry. Afterwards I was utterly baffled by the denouement of the movie. It's a courtroom scene and one of some duration at that because that is precisely what a movie about boats, oceans and storms should end with... yes a courtroom scene where the characters recount their experiences with the captain on trial for negligence. But that's Ridley Scott, he is a slave to the screenplay even if it's not a good one.

This DVD of White Squall is not anamorphic, so keep that in mind if you have a widescreen TV. Furthermore a film like this would most certainly benefit from a Blu-ray release. It is definitely worth a watch just for the cinematography and production values alone. You never know, the assembly line screenplay might work for you more than it worked for me or Gene Siskel.",1256774400,,3295,4.667814113597246

A strange combination of school film and ocean adventure, White Squall functions capably before it overstays its welcome with a bizarre courtroom finale that stands at right angles to the rest of the film; it's worth a rental perhaps, but you might just want to turn off the movie with 15 minutes remaining.",1244505600,,325,4.803571428571429

793402,4,630410605X,"The movie tells the true story of a group of boys finishing high school on board a sailing ship in the early 60's.  It's a coming of age film in a sense and there is the requisite high jinks and conflict that must fill in the gaps of an otherwise thoughtful journey that must come to a dramatic climax.

Most everything comes together nicely and if you like the ocean, sailing ships or going on a journey into the unknown, you would do well to see this movie.  Nothing too silly or gratuitous.

The original music is very nice and even haunting at times.

As you watch it, think of a journey you want to take and let it inspire you to make it so.  The opening sequence with Scott Wolf doing the voiceover and setting the stage for what is yet to come is simple, but compelling as he embarks upon his quest for meaning.

The ending with Jeff Bridges and the final summation by Wolf is powerful.  It's a story of change and who among us can't identify with that.

Finally, enjoy the very appropriately chosen tune by Sting called ""Valparaiso"" as the credits roll.",1219968000,,1061,4.345177664974619

793490,4,630410605X,"There is really no end to the amount of coming-of-age movies out there today.  In fact `White Squall' is neither the first nor the last but it is one of my favorites.  It reminds me quite a bit of `Dead Poets Society' but less cheesy and more emotionally resounding.  I know that many won't agree with me on that last statement but I am proudly in the minority who believe that `Dead Poets Society' is extremely overrated.

`White Squall' is a true story about a group of teenage boys who board the Albatross, a school-boat (is that what it would be called) manned by Captain Christopher Sheldon.  Aboard this boat these boys would learn, in addition to their normal schoolwork, how to sail, respect and rely on one another and thus be a real crew.  These boys would learn the lessons to make them better men.  Some of the boys are there because they crave the adventure, some are there because their parents want them to learn some values and others are there because they are really completely mistaken as to what the whole experience is all about.  They aren't on a luxury cruise.  They aren't on a vacation.  This is work, this is school, this is learning and in essence this is life at its hardest yet most fulfilling.

Jeff Bridges has always been one of my favorite actors.  He always brings a lot to his performances and he manages to even elevate mediocre material to new heights.  Here he isn't handed anything mediocre and thus his performance is all the more lifted.  As Caption Christopher Sheldon he displays a varying array of emotional responses to his young crew and commands their respect and attention.  The cast of young actors is impressive as well, young Scott Wolf truly stealing the light.  He plays Chuck, the films narrator and thus the films star.  His performance is rich for his young age and may even be his finest performance to date.  Others like Ryan Phillippe, Ethan Embry, Jason Marsden, Eric Michael Cole and Jeremy Sisto lend a hand at creating an authentic experience.

`White Squall' has some tender moments, some heartbreaking ones at that; most of which fall at the films conclusion.  The final moments of the film will touch anyone's heart, and while certain moments may come off a little weepy they are effecting and work their magic on the audience.  It may not be a perfect film but Ridley Scott (seriously one of the greatest directors working today) manages to direct his cast into moments of greatness and manages to capture the feel of the ocean in all its deadly beauty.  Anyone craving a high seas adventure with heart, soul and a lesson will love this tragic true story or bravery and courage; courage not only to man the seas but to man your life.",1202342400,2,2700,4.628151260504202

Other mainstream directors like James Cameron and Steven Spielberg have basically recognition for every movie they've  made, but with movies like White Squall, there is a forgotten element to what Ridley Scott has done with his career.  White Squall is a gem of a movie that has gone unnoticed for too long.  Jeff Bridges is excellent as are the rest of the actors.  This is a story that will pull you in and is addictive.  It's like a book you can't put down.  The style of the movie is a little removed from Scott's more modern works, but it's definately him behind the camera.

Those of you who are looking for an adventure of epic proportions that will take you over two oceans and dozens of islands with a group of equally interesting and at times disturbing characters, buckle up because you're in for one hell of a ride. This film was done perfectly, for once the film is better then the book (or so I've heard) and the final outcome can bring any minority, peoples of all ages and all professions to tears. The first time I saw this I was probably six years old and by the end of it my eight year old brother had become claustrophobic and huddled himself in a corner and my mother was crying. If I hadn't had been so busy laughing at them, I would have probably done the same. What happened out on the sea to those boys over forty years ago can only be described as a tragedy. A tragedy after finding themselves and the meaning to many things that they left on shore. This film truly honors those months that they spent together out on the crest and the weeks in which they were interrogated and put to trial after losing their friends in helpless cases. Shocking and worthy of such honorable men.

The locations, from seaside slums to life aboard ship to the storm, are all wonderfully displayed. The compelling visuals enhance the real-life based story. It is a multi-layered tale, part coming of age, part bonding friends, part action drama. No one theme overwhelms the others. As an extra on this film, it was a privilage to meet the real Chuck Geig and Tod Johnstone.

793595,4,630410605X,"I personally saw this movie a few years ago. As with

793596,3,630410605X,"I, for one, don't understand the loyalty that the kids showed their Captain in the final scenes. Nothing at sea convinced me that there was *any* kind of bonding going on whatsoever between anyone. When bonding issues did arise, they appeared faked, phony, and I didn't buy them for a second.

This is an interesting film to watch if you want to see a bunch of young, attractive boys running around practically naked most of the film. I can't imagine that the *real* cast (as this was based on a true story) was nearly as easy on the eye, so I don't understand why so many pretty faces were cast. What happened to average boys? Fat boys? There was one boy who wore thick glasses, but I ignored him, as he seemed to be the requisite.

This is an interesting film to watch if you want to see the ocean. Ridley Scott may not be the greatest at evoking emotions within the characters he directs, but he shoots one heck of a scene.

About 2/3 of the way through this film I asked myself, ""Why am I still watching this? There's no plot, nothing of interest is happening, so what am I doing?"" I did stop watching it, in fact, but then finished the last third two days later. At the end of the movie something actually happens, and it's very moving. It has to do with what the film is named for: a white squall. A white squall is a violent tropical or subtropical storm that stirs up the surface of the sea into whitecaps, but is limited to a very localized area, often with no storm clouds present. This was pretty much the case here, although I thought I spotted a few storm clouds. I won't say what happens when the white squall hits the ship, because if I do this review won't be published, but I will say that the film's only moments of quality come during the storm, and on land shortly thereafter (although on land, it's still a tad hoaky).

793719,3,630410605X,"I've changed my rating of this film after watching it two more times.
Originally, I liked the first part of the film much more than the ending, which features a court scene.  I downrated the film on the contrast between the thoroughly entertaining film that features the 'boys on the boat', and the judicial scenes at the end of the film.
After seeing the film on two separate, subsequent occasions, I've changed my mind a bit.  The final half hour of the film does match, in my changed viewpoint, the intensity and fine acting that preceded the last scences.
Jeff Bridges gives another excellent performance.  His cool, laconic performance is just so right for this film.  He hits every note.
Also to be praised is the acting of the rest of the cast.  They do an excellent job conveying the melding of a crew out of a disparate group of young men with wildly different backgrounds.  And Caroline Goodall gives an equally effective performance as his wife.
Admittedly, the film does follow some familiar paths during the titular storm.  Let's say not all bodes well for everyone on the voyage.
Directed by Ridley Scott, who has directed such hits as 'Blackhawk Down' and 'Gladiator'.  'White Squall' is a quieter film than those, but equally as effective.
Recommended.  But be sure to wear your life jacket when on one a boat called the 'Albatross'",1064361600,,1348,4.75107296137339

Ridley Scott just became one of my favorite directors after watching the movie. How I wish I was one of the characters.

If you liked Dead Poet's Society (DPS is better because of Robin Williams) or A Separate Peace by John Knowles, you will like this movie.  It is a movie that leads you on a journey, using a group of rich kids that signed up for a year at sea.  Jeff Bridges is the tough captain that sets out to instill discipline and teach them that they must respect him, the ship, and, most importantly, each other.
I won't give away the ending, but the movie succeeds in delivering its messages of honor and individual responsibility.  It does a fantastic job of delivering this message while leading you along a journey with Jeff Bridges and the crew of the ship.",1036972800,5,932,4.333333333333333

793723,4,630410605X,"""White Squall,"" the almost-forgotten 1996 high seas motion picture from acclaimed director Ridley Scott, is the kind of old fashioned adventure Hollywood and even Walt Disney used to churn out in the 1940s and 1950s. If you squint your eyes just right, you can almost see Gregory Peck or John Mills playing the lead role rather than the comfortably aged Jeff Bridges.
But what sets ""White Squall"" apart from that long ago era of filmmaking are the modern conflicts the handful of youthful protagonists, high school students on a seasonal seafaring voyage, must go through. These kids, effectively played by such future stars as Scott Wolf and Ryan Phillipe, are dealing with a variety of painful issues including parental conflict, parental control and society rejection. What they learn from their stern captain/teacher and his colorfully eccentric crew are the lessons most children must eventually embrace -- the rewards of teamwork, discipline and nobility.
Bridges, in yet another terrific performance to add to his respectful resume, plays a no-nosense ship captain who leads a group of high school students on a seafaring voyage across the Caribbean and beyond. During their adventure, they encounter exotic locales, the Cuban military, first love and eventually, a terrifying storm bearing the ominous meteorological phenomenon known as the white squall.
Most viewers have probably seen such high adventures before, and the eventual resolution, where the boys band together as one to honor their befallen captain, is certainly not the most original of conclusions. But just beneath the surface of ""White Squall,"" likely fueled by the vision of director Ridley Scott, is a celluoid tribute to a simpler more innocent time. The film, based on a true story, takes place in 1962 -- an era before man walked on the moon, before John F. Kennedy was assassinated, before computers ruled our household. ""White Squall"" is an effective tribute to old fashioned values, gritty teamwork and the simple truths of humanity.
Viewers desentisized by so much dreck that Hollywood offers today, will learn these truths much like the high school students on the deck of this creaking schooner. Scott whose work has often relied on flashy special effects (""Alien,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""Gladiator""), has given us a film that glorifies the basic values of an innocent, golden time. When the white squall of the film's title slams into the ship, we are witnessing the end of an idyllic era and a storied way of life.
A poignant, touching experience, and one of Scott's finest films (which says a lot for this challenging, gifted director), ""White Squall"" is the kind of powerful moviegoing surprise viewers will want to welcome aboard again and again.",1001116800,,2732,5.169300225733634

His mission is to teach a group of high school boys the way of the sea and of life.  All of the boys have  problems and, as written and portrayed, some are real heartbreakers.  And  director Ridley Scott has collected a handsome group of teen hunks to  portray them.  There is not a false note in any of their performances.  Ryan Phillippe particular continues to surprise and impress me with his  versatility.  Whether it be the sensitive gay boy in T.V's ""One Life  to Live"" or the overly confident and cocky jock of the film I KNOW  WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER he is always convincing.  Phillippe is truly an  actor that bears watching.  Kudos also to John Savage as the ship's English  teacher.  It's nice to see this underrated actor try a different sort of  role for a change. The cinematography is splendid but to appreciate it fully  you must see a wide screen edition of the film.  If not on DVD, perhaps  there is a wide screen edition on tape somewhere.  But the cinematography  and sound are both worth buying a DVD player, if you haven't already done  so, and purchasing this disc. This reviewer is always wary of films which  are advertised as coming-of-age movies, but this one fits the bill.  And  everyone, including the skipper learns from their experiences.
