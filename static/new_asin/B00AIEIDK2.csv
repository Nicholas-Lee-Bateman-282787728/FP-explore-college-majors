8552174,5,B00AIEIDK2,Ronnie Lane's Rockpalast performance features a later version of his band (with guest Rolling Stones pianist Ian Stewart).  Lane shows no signs of the disease that would eventually take his life and the band is in fine form for the broadcast.  I can't recommend this recording enough!,1397692800,5,284,5.0212765957446805
