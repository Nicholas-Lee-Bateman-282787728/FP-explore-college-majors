8203734,5,B000FC2HOU,"I have seen this production twice in Sydney and on ABC TV, the National Broadcaster in Australia, though not with this cast. I simply enjoy this DVD of ""Un Ballo in Maschera"" as a memory of a good traditional production, with the Swedish setting, here with Leona Mitchell as Amelia. As for the other reviews here, they apply to a far different production on DVD with Riciarelli, not Leona Mitchell, as Amelia. I feel I had to clarify this for potential buyers. Opera Australia (earlier known as The Australian Opera) has released, with the ABC, a range of their productions from their archives plus recent productions e.g. Dame Joan Sutherland's classic ""Lakme"" in its production mounted for her, alongside Emma Matthew's ( a fine coloratura) more recent Lakme with a ""Bollywood"" look. I enjoy both. I encourage international opera lovers to try OA's DVD's.",1357430400,2,857,4.958333333333333
