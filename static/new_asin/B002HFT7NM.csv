3928401,5,B002HFT7NM,"Action, adventure, comedy, gorgeous scenery, authentic-looking costumes and settings, romance, and the most beautiful musical score! ""Return to Treasure Island"" features all that and has the added plus of containing zero profanity. It is safe and enjoyable for all ages (well, probably too much fighting for small kids, but at least there's no gore).

I taped this wonderful 10-part mini-series off the Disney Channel back in the 80s. My husband, 2 sons, and I watched it over and over again until the tapes wore out. In recent years I have repeatedly checked on Amazon to see if it was out on DVD and always came up disappointed. Nothing was available except old, used video tapes. How could something this good just disappear? Finally, to my great joy, I found this series in DVD (3-disc set with all 10 episodes) on the UK Amazon site and I was able to see my husband's face light up on Christmas morning when he opened his gift.

We are living overseas and have a region-free DVD player, so we are able to view it.  However, we will eventually move back to the US and I wish it were also available in region-1 format.  When/if that happens I hope they will add subtitles. I love the pirate talk (so quirky and funny), but a lot of the dialog is hard to understand. It would also be nice to have some bonus features (background info on the making of the movie). A series this good deserves first-class treatment!",1259020800,22,1415,4.603174603174603
3928402,5,B002HFT7NM,"I don't usually take to sequels, but this one's a corker. Great story. Intelligent scripting and wonderful performances all shot in exotic locales.

However, it is the performance by Brian Blessed as Long John Silver that captures the gold here(and jewells too!)  His Long John is simply spectacular. He roars, he cajoles, he croons, he grovels.... With all respect to Mr. Newton, Blessed's performance is academy award(okay, Emmy award, after all it was made by Disney for the new Disney Channel)stuff.

Not released on DVD in the U.S., I purchased a multi-region DVD player expressly to view this series. Forget Pirates of the Carribean, mateys.... this is the goods!

3928403,5,B002HFT7NM,"I was privileged to watch this series many years ago while living in Scotland. My roommate and I were absolutely hooked. Its delights are almost too numerous to mention, but among them are the script, the score, the direction and the usual sterling British cast, headed by Brian Blessed, who was born to play Silver with his broad face, bigger than life personality and ability to portray both Silver's charm and his considerable menace. I also remember finding Reiner Schoene quite attractive as a new character. The music is particularly delightful - I used to hum it all week between shows. So WHY is this not available on DVD in the US? Between this and the perfect-in-every-way 1992 ""Treasure Island,"" we TI afficionados are being deprived our fix! We want to live on more than memories...",1253232000,16,794,4.845588235294118
8370269,5,B002HFT7NM,"When this series first aired on television back in 1988, I knew I had to have a video, but I couldn't find any available. So I began to do periodic searches and finally found this one. It's funny how you forget things, especially over a 27 year span, but viewing The Return To Treasure Island was almost like seeing the series for the first time, while remembering some of the highlights. The hate and love relationship you feel for Brian Blessed's character of Capt. Long John Silver keeps you enthralled to see what antics he will initiate next on the ex-cabin boy and now Oxford graduate - Jim Hawkins, who is this series focused main character.",1441929600,,648,4.594827586206897
8370270,4,B002HFT7NM,"The series is timeless, what an incredible take on a sequel! i watched this on the disney channel back in the day, and unfortunately, the quality of this DVD set does not live up to the boradcast quality of the disney channel. I REALLy wish they would do a new transfer from the film and just to even a make-shift remastering of the film and sound, and get us a Blu-ray edition. the quality of the VHS and DVD's is terrible. You can tell it came from a 3/4"" mastertape that has poor video transfer quality

if the video quality were better, i would give this a 5",1434326400,,562,4.203703703703703
8370271,5,B002HFT7NM,The series just as I remembered it. All the episodes are complete. The set is in PAL but I was able to convert it to NTSC to be able to watch it. I have all 10 episodes available minus the episode selection screen is any are interested. It is not high definition and the quality is an older DVD. You have to remember that they didn't have the tech back them for high def. Very watchable and I was more interested in revisiting the tale rather than notice any stray screen artifacts. Still say it is Ken Colley's best performance as Ben Gunn.,1413676800,,541,4.262135922330097
8370272,5,B002HFT7NM,"No version even comes close to this retelling of  the beloved story of Treasure Island. You can't touch this one's greatness. It is outstanding in EVERY way. Brian Blessed MAKES the movie! His character will delight viewers of ALL ages - he's the perfect pirate...wily & cunning, charming, foreboding, adventurous. You can't help being taken by him & his hearty laughter. This movie is contagious & any viewer who watches it will want their own copy of it for future generations of viewers, GUARANTEED! It needs to be formatted for other regions. I am not the only person in America asking this be done or who's tried to hunt it down - I'm just one of the few (like the other reviewers) whose chosen to pipe up & raise my voice about it. Someone needs to shake some sense into the powers that be because IDIOTS are at the wheel! No fantastic show should be hidden beneath a bushel. This mini-series is better than most movies being churned out today! Excellent script & performances. Well worth the effort to make it available to everyone!",1389484800,,1039,4.646739130434782
8370273,5,B002HFT7NM,"I have hunted for this for years...only to find it here for region 2 & therefore requiring the purchase of a dvd player that will actually play it which may or may not work/be compatible with U.S. outlets/hookups! Too much work to go through for one simple, but exceedingly GREAT movie mini-series! It isn't worth the trouble. It needs to be formatted for Region 1, period! There are a multitude of viewers who would be in line for the buy & would boast before sharing it with many other NEW viewers at their insistence (& in turn, potential new additional BUYERS - guaranteed domino effect or the multiplication factor of ""he told two friends who told two friends who told four or more & so on"")! We persist in requesting this show be made for U.S. viewers! No one can watch it and NOT be won over by the performances & script. Brian Blessed is the absolute clincher as the charming and grisly pirate Long John Silver. How stupid are the people in charge to not expand their market to include this outstanding TV mini-series for MORE regions! They should be fired!!!",1389484800,,1067,4.5625
8370274,5,B002HFT7NM,"excellent, can't understand why not more popular in the States. Loved the story since my dad took me to the first one as a boy as well as all of Stevenson's books.",1388188800,4,163,4.125
8370275,5,B002HFT7NM,"I don't know who's bright idea it was to keep this program in the dark where they keep mushrooms and what mushroom grow in, but they most certainly have made a mistake. There are questionable DVDs that are selling right now. To think that this show might have a market with a little advertising should be an absolute when the coarse of action is to have it forgotten and locked away. Why not make this a title that can be released as a DVD-R like other title have been. Seriously this is such a waste. What would it take to upload this like a Kindle book. It wouldn't cost anything and would be worth the effort.",1360713600,2,612,4.2844827586206895
8370276,5,B002HFT7NM,"I watched this series in the early 80s when it aired on HBO, and it's every bit as good as I remembered - great production values, strong characters and a believeable story line. I've watched all the movie versions of Treasure Island, and in my opinion Brian Blessed is the ultimate Long John Silver.
The Region 2 format means it won't play in most standard DVD players,
however I have been able to watch in on my computer using Cyberlink Power
DVD (v7)- excellent picture quality. I hope I'm not breaking Canada's draconian new copyright law by bypassing the lock in this manner. It's also possible to buy dvd players that will read discs from all zones, but they're a bit more money.
For anyone who likes pirate movies like I do, this series is a must-have and worth
every doubloon.

8370277,5,B002HFT7NM,This is one of the best action series I've seen.  Why isn't it available in the United States?  Do you know how long I have been looking for it on DVD?  I watched this mini series on the Disney Channel every chance I got.  I even named one of my cats Vanderbrecken.,1313971200,5,265,4.038461538461538
8370278,5,B002HFT7NM,"Like the other folks who have reviewed this series, I watched it many years ago when it was on the Disney Channel on TV and fell in love with the characters, the music, and the locations!  I have frequently looked here and on Disney's home page and have even sent them letters asking for it to be made available.  It was such a wonderful series!  Brian Blessed is an extremely talented actor.  He was the BEST Long John Silver!",1306800000,7,427,4.367088607594937
