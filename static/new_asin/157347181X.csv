193224,1,157347181X,"I thought with the director and cast that this movie might be worth viewing so I rented it.  WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!  If there is a plot it is miniscule.  The cast must have had overdue mortgage payments to agree to be in this abomination.  One sees more useless scenes of the Hollywood sign; Hollywood landmarks and CA traffic than anything else. Do Not waste time by viewing the film.  If someone offers it to you for free, refuse.",971654400,,432,4.35
193225,1,157347181X,"This movie is so bad it hurts to watch it.  With the cast, and John Landis directing, I expected at least modest entertainment, but this movie didn't deliver.  Not only does the plot make no sense..Adrian Paul as the rich ex-boyfriend hasn't changed his will to cut out Natass after THREE years?  but it has all these super irritating scenes that look like they are  happening...I am a fan of  Adrian Paul, I should have realized when he doesn't get mentioned on the  jacket that his part was small..like 45 seconds.  My recommendation..watch  an old highlander episode and save your $.",965692800,8,586,4.732673267326732
193226,1,157347181X,"It is both a travesty and an insult not only to the viewers of this comedy (and I use the term ""comedy"" loosely)but to the large ensemble of gifted actors in this ill-fated project !
It is a plot that has been so  overused and better executed in past comedy movies dealing with the same  subject matter; The wife or husband who wants to gain the significant  other's inheritance by having them ""nixed"" (usually by hiring  someone to do the dirty deed).Though, such a subject matter has been used  for thriller films as well. Even the bumbling duo who botch up the job in  the beginning of this clunker are typical characters found in other movies.  The tricks and charades are very much cliche here!
The most appalling  thing is the enormous ensemble of some of today's best actors used to carry  out this lethargic and boring flick. It is lethargic in the sense that the  humor and jokes were lacking in both content and quality (I know this  statement is subjective, but see for yourselves and decide) with regards to  the writing !
When a movie contains Natassja Kinski, Lara Flynn Boyle,  Billy Zane, Michael Biehn, Adrian Paul, Dan Aykroyd, etc., etc., you expect  top performances; You do get them in this comedy ! However, the material  given to them is not something I (if I were an actor) would want to have  added to my list of credited film roles.
Wait until some viewers sit  through ending. Can you say MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT...",960940800,2,1439,4.602362204724409
193227,1,157347181X,"I was going to write a VERY lengthy summation as to why this movie was so bad, but I decided it (the movie) isn't worth the time or effort. I'm not even close to kidding folks!  Suffice it to say that the story had holes in  it big enough to drive a tractor trailer through.  The movie dragged on and  on. On and on. On and on. On and on with little to NO developement  plot-wise. The last 30 minutes of the movie was filled with those  MEGA-ANNOYING false finishes. You know, the kind where you think the action  is real, but someone was only dreaming that particular scenario. Completely  irritating.  POOR character developement.  A cheese-bag ending to end all  cheese-bag endings. Someone (I won't tell which character) gets away clean  as an accessory to murder, while everyone else pays. ""Well, so  what?"" you might ask. The thing is, you're left scratching your head,  wondering what made her so damn special. She was just as guilty, and as  bad, as everyone else. It made NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.They (the writers)  should be ashamed of this piece of drivel. For the all star cast they had,  a mentally-challenged baboon could have sat in front of a typewriter,  randomly hit keys for a week, and came up with a better script. So, in a  way, I encourage you to rent it. You have to see it to believe it. The  utter wasting of so much acting talent I mean.",960076800,2,1360,4.451219512195122
193228,4,157347181X,"In Australia, this film is titled ""Susan's Plan"" which is, im sorry, a much better title than ""Dying to get rich"". The first time I saw the film I thought it was enjoyable enough, but I had an  immediate urge to view it again, so I did, and it got more enjoyable. Not  that much happens but for some unknown reason, I am drawn to it. The great  cast is the only reason I can think of. What a killer group. If you saw it  once and didn't think much.. See it again, you'll like it more. (P.S.  Michael Biehn is a standout.)",957916800,10,521,4.019417475728155

7798418,2,157347181X,"Susan's Plan (1998), is a movie that draws viewers (on the one
hand)  from the star-drawing power of the European mass media
magnet Nastassja Kinski, and American actor Billy Zane, as well
as from comedy giant  Rob Schneider, talented Lara Flynn Boyle
(the latter reprising a shady role, as seen also in The Big
Squeeze, for example) and  Dan Aykroyd (as a biker hired gun.)

This movie has both ups and downs; the pro's comprising the
lighter moments also with Dan Aykroyd (as a biker hired gun), the
quality filming and sound of the film, with nonsensical elements.

The weaker aspects  whittle  down  viewers' experiences, namely,
the many product placements in the movie (gym machines in TV spots,
Nintendo console, answering machine, cell - mobile phone and
other modern electronics shown) which is crudely blatant, lasting
often 2 or 3 minutes at a time- not fitting  in the story, Further
examples of a weakened experience, is the illogical, chaotic
editing, reminiscent of another movie done by NK (The Hotel New
Hampshire). For instance, there are 3, 4 or 5 sequences of
characters  day-dreaming of gun play, with very graphic,unnecessarily
cruel special effects, which is also the case also with the rough
bed scene action that (albeit silly, and comical) may be offensive
and limit part of a potential audience.

In sum,  this movie ""works"" passably from the charisma of the
actors and quality of the montage, despite all other lesser aspects
already  mentioned. In terms of replay value, there is little.",1360540800,,1516,4.99203187250996
7798419,5,157347181X,"I was pleasantly surprised by this insane and very funny movie from John Landis.  The acting ensemble is terrific and the film is very unusual.  I think perhaps people always want happy endings and this movie does not have one.  Bad people do bad things and do not get away with it.  Not for everyone, but an adventurous and smart movie.",1310342400,2,337,4.475409836065574

7798421,3,157347181X,"Nastassja Kinski(Cold Heart, Cat People) hires Billy Zane(Zoolander, Tombstone), Dan Aykroyd(tv's Psi Factor, Ghostbusters 1 and 2), Lara Flynn Boyle(tv's The Practice, Afterglow), Michael Biehn(The Rock, The Art Of War) and Rob Schneider(Hot Chick, The Animal) into a plan that would kill her ex-husband Adrian Paul(Highlander Endgame, Christine)...Biehn and Schneider shoot Paul three times but he doesnt die....this is a good black comedy with some funny ass moments...a lot of dreaming and waking up though...Zane is hilarious...Kinski is hot and Biehn as Dave is just a plain dumbass...mainly Biehn in his movies plays a cop or a seal or a badguy. other actors are Joey Travolta, Lisa Eichhorn, Bill Duke(Predator, Commando) and Thomas Haden Church(Demon Knight, George of the jungle).",1070582400,,790,5.591666666666667
7798422,5,157347181X,"It seems like too many people don't understand the simple fact that this movie is not about the plot!  It's not supposed to make sense!  The entire movie is one giant nonsensical joke.  It's kind of like Andy Kaufman and the fact that everything he did was all a part of an hilarious prank pulled on millions of people.  This movie is a joke, and we--the viewers--are the punchline.  It is meant to be like that.  But then again, I guess if it weren't for people who hate the movie, it wouldn't be funny to people like myself.
For anyone who understands John Landis, this is a must-have!",1007078400,9,587,4.388888888888889
7798423,4,157347181X,"With a cast like this, you can only expect a flop. Yet these reviewers who dumped on this flick musta watched something else, 'cause this movie, although not innovative, was an enjoyable romp into the outer-limits of these talented actors' range. If you didn't like this movie, then go watch the Talented Mr. Ripley, then come back. Compared to that movie, you can enjoy anything...",995587200,7,382,4.892307692307693
7798424,4,157347181X,"The other reviewers do make a few good points.  I'll admit, this not an amazing film, but I certainly enjoyed it.  Watch it once and its kind of difficult to grasp.  Watch it again, and everything comes together.  A third time, and the film is just as good.  A good cast brings comedy (not amazing, but worthwhile) to the film.  All of the actors are well-cast and play their parts well, making a slightly shaky plot a lot more believable.  This movie is not torture at all (as other reviewers said), and it is perfect for rainy days.  I definentaly reccomend it.",979948800,12,563,4.450980392156863
