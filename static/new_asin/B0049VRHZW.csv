8419450,5,B0049VRHZW,"Bill Nye never disappoints.  My students love him, and although the video is recommended for grade 4  & up, my first graders understand the concepts he teaches.",1403395200,,160,4.888888888888889
8419451,5,B0049VRHZW,Well done. Enjoyable and covered all concepts clearly. I found a study guide online and was able to use this video successfully with a sub.,1381363200,,139,4.6
8419452,3,B0049VRHZW,"I use these videos as a fun way to reinforce what we learn in our science lessons (we homeschool).  My boys, 9 & 10 years old, really like Bill Nye's crazy antics, and they laugh through the whole thing.  Bill Nye has a great way of connecting with kids, and teaching them in such a way that it makes science ""cool"".  Who knew the Water Cycle could be so entertaining, much take up 26 minutes to explain it?!

I took off one star for the outdated, irrelevant ""stars"" featured in this episode (my kids have no idea who Joey Lawrence is), and one star for the price of the product.  I would recommend this video for any science-crazy kids, but I would suggest looking for it in your library first.",1364947200,2,695,4.315384615384615
