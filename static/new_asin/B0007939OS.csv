8046018,4,B0007939OS,"The above poster got a bad copy - mine was fine, right disk in right package, segments fine.  Good content, good footage, more than I was expecting.  My boy loves it, and the disk is a good length.

Ads and commentaries I could do without.",1150243200,,239,4.266666666666667
8046019,5,B0007939OS,This DVD actually has World Finals 2 Freestyle. And The World Finals 2 DVD has World Finals 3 Freestyle. The Freestyle segments are backwards. Just a heads up before you buy it and be like WTF? when you watch it at home. Other than that the action is great. Lost of mayhem and destruction.,1129075200,4,289,4.37037037037037
