7734330,4,B01EBH07K0,"First, a very important note: As of this writing, Amazon lists this as a Region B/2 recording and thus incompatible with U. S. players, which Is flat wrong; it is an all-regions disc and plays just fine on NTSC equipment. I am submitting a correction; so I hope that this note will not be required in the future.

Also, you need to know the program:

Bizet: LArlsienne  Suite No. 2: FARANDOLE
Berlioz: Rkczy March
Poulenc: Concerto for 2 Pianos and Orchestra
Saint-Saens: Le Carnaval des animaux: FINALE
Ravel: Daphnis et Chlo  Suite No. 2
BOLERO
Offenbach: Orphe aux enfers: CAN-CAN
Johann Strauss II: WIENER BLUT Waltzer

Although what follows may seem like damning with faint praise, and even though there are a couple of lackluster performances, I recommend this disc, especially if one can buy it at under $20 Blu-ray, or $15 for the DVD. We have here one of the great orchestras of the world, led by Seymon Bychkov, a sensitive and competent, if sometimes uninspiring, conductor, in the superb setting that is the Schnbrunn Palace gardens of Vienna. Furthermore, the performance by the Labque Sisters of the Poulenc Two-Piano Concerto is easily worth the price. On top of that, if youve seen this telecast on PBS, youve missed two very fine parts of the concert: the finale of the Carnival of the Animals and the Daphnis et Chlo Second Suite of Ravel. The visuals are stunning, and the recorded sound is as good as it needs to be to provide an enjoyable experience--no doubt far better than what the live audience at Schnbrunn heard. Finally, the view of couples dancing to Wiener Blut will certainly warm the hearts of any lover of Vienna and the Waltz Kings music.

Now, however, I must report on the several ways this enterprise falls short of what it could have been. First, and most importantly, a couple of the smaller pieces fell flat: The LArlsienne Farandole was staid; and the Rkczy March was one of the more lethargic renditions Ive ever heard, not at all suitable for the madman composer Berlioz.

The audio was good enough: I give it 4 stars out of 5 for the DTS-surround track, even though the engineers were not quite able to overcome what I suspect were the rather poor acoustics of the shell. The balance between pianos and orchestra was, for my taste, a little too heavy on the pianos for the Poulenc and Saint-Sans; but the pianos were where the action was, so perhaps other listeners will prefer their acoustic prominence. The PCM Stereo track was not very good in terms of stereo placement; there wasn't enough spread; and while the synthetic surround setting on my receiver has made many a native-stereo soundtrack sound great, it only resulted in even more intense centering in this case; so by all means, if you have a surround setup, select the DTS surround track (which is not the defaultbe careful).

Just a few more words about Amazons listings: Amazon has a bad and continuing habit of listing classical recordings made in Europe as being incompatible with American players. I suppose they're to be commended for a better safe than sorry approach where the playability of a disc might be in doubt; but all someone had to do was look at the back cover of the package to see that it is listed as all-regions compatible. At the time of this writing, a search on Amazon for Vienna Philharmonic Schonbrunn 2016 brings up only one disc offeringat almost 3 times the normal price; it lists the disc as all-regions playable, which combined with the misinformation about the standard offering, would lead one to believe that (s)he would have to buy the $55 version rather than the $20 version in order to play it in the U. S. In addition, if one types Vienna Summer Night 2016 in Amazons search bar, only the streaming and digital download versions appear; you have to search on Sommernachts Konzert to find the disc offerings. Amazon really needs to clear up this mess. Finally, Amazon does not even provide a program listing!

If youve stuck with me this far in this review, let me reiterate and conclude by saying that, overlooking a few relatively minor shortcomings, this a very enjoyable and recommendable disc.",1476057600,17,4143,4.751043115438108
8758307,5,B01EBH07K0,I love the Summer night concert series from Schonbrunn Palace.  This 2016 blu ray of the program was particularly nice.  The selections were all French except for Wiener Blut at the end.  The images were very clear and the sound (DTS) was excellent.  The Francis Poulenc Concerto for 2 pianos and orchestra was amazingly performed.,1535500800,,331,4.963636363636364
8758308,2,B01EBH07K0,"I hate to be a naysayer after all the prior glowing reviews, but I am compelled to do so in defense of the music. The music is superb and well-chosen. Bychkov and the Vienna  are wonderful  BUT...the person who directed this video presentation should receive a Rotten Tomato Award for the video content. I don't care to see who in the audience is indulging in a champagne fest or who is milling around in front of the camera while the orchestra is playing. It's annoying and distracting for the viewer, and insulting to the musicians who are playing onstage. There are camera shots that are so distant one would suspect that they were taken from space. The stage looks microscopic and indistinct. There are ridiculous drone shots that circle the stage like mosquitoes in search of prey. There are mind-numbing intercuts of gardens, fountains, statues,even of people doing absolutely nothing of interest except for being near the cameraman/woman. All the while what I want to see are the musicians - their technique, their response to Bychkov's conducting, in other words - their PERFORMANCE! The artsy videography is distracting, indulgent and  DISRESPECTFUL, If the producers wanted to show off the grounds they could have made it a special feature option. I enjoyed the music but found the video editing annoying and unnecessary. Beware - if the music is your first priority and not a travelogue then look elsewhere.",1529798400,,1418,4.974683544303797
