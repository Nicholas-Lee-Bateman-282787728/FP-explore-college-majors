8492192,4,B0063T133K,"El Ambulant (""The Peddler,"" 2010), directed jointly by Eduardo de la Serna, Lucas Marcheggiano, and Adriana Yurcovich, is the spiritual and psychological opposite of Joshua Oppenheimer's The Act of Killing (2013), in which the outsider-filmmaker (Oppenheimer) catalyzes and documents cinematic scenes in a Hollywood style (though the conceptualization behind these is personal; the former torturers and executioners are wholly responsible for the scripts). A notable difference between the two films, aside from tone, is their aesthetic and socio-political achievement (Oppenheimer's film is the more accomplished), but it may be useful to the reader-viewer to know that The Peddler offers a kind of emotional antidote to the harrowing odyssey of guilt and denial of 'Killing, if they ever happen to be seen together, or placed on the same program (addressing, for example, the impact of American film culture on foreign audiences), which perhaps they should.
Despite various formal shortcomings (e.g., the dissolve is a frequent and for the most part unjustified transition choice) The Peddler is a work of joy. It is also a document of consumer empowerment, as it follows the unusual means by which a rural film audience admires, influences, and defines film content, in a full filmmaking arc - i.e., from pre-production to exhibition - typically associated with more advanced technologies. The communal, highly interactive process is initiated and organized by an itinerant filmmaker who operates in Argentina's remote areas, producing feature films in small townships using volunteer `talent'. The unusually swift casting, performing, directing, technical support, post-production and publicity is manifestly unprofessional, yet Daniel Burmeister, the catalytic figure behind these cinematic events, manages to eke out a living from the string of shoestring projects he helms each year, often using borrowed equipment, donated food and facilities, and shooting entirely on locations he has little or no previous knowledge of. The resulting features are promoted by word of mouth and by Burmeister himself, with a bullhorn attached to the roof of his ailing car, which he drives through the streets and dirt roads of neighborhoods and town centers - a technique commonly used by politicians in Mexican and South American farming communities. If no traditional film venue exists within walking distance, one is improvised from a civic auditorium or church. Though the arrival of viewers is almost never punctual - something Serna attributes to a distinctly rural sense of leisure time - the screening is nevertheless well attended and received, allowing Burmeister to earn enough money from the door to repeat the cycle in other towns, his way paved by glowing reviews and letters of recommendation from local officials and ministers of culture.
  It is important to bear in mind that these screenings, with the boisterous response they elicit, are not celebrations of the pictures themselves but the fruition of their labor, a delight in their fantastic record. The features - epic comedies - are intended for a single public exhibition, where they not only have their greatest impact with the audience they are made for and with, but enable the repetition of the process by which they came into being, preserving the viability of Burmeister's peripatetic filmmaking, without any apparent concern for the posterity of its cinematic (video) products. In this case a union of screening event and production is achieved that does not benefit from expertise, wide distribution, convenient access, and/or repeated consumption.  The value of the film object is the work it entails, its memory triggered by numerous passages in the completed picture. Viewers are offered the sudden appearance of a cohesive narrative, together with a sense of integrity in the loose script they were given (from a handful that Burmeister continually recycles). Non-diegetic music and moments of frenzied, exaggerated action support stories of love, life, money, and the struggle to retain or regain them. A variety of recognizable interiors and locales are reframed as dramatic fiction, and the cast is entirely local. These aspects of the ""world premiere"" are necessarily regarded by the audience as directly associated with community life, yet in the manner of cinema, with all that term suggests to participants. The extraordinary reception - what can safely be called the finished picture's life - is due largely to a heightened and expanded identification, as viewers are publicly presented with their various technical and artistic roles in the picture screened. They are not only the cinematographers and lighting personnel and leads and extras, but the people who are not normally these things, and very likely never expected to be. It is natural then, that the `film' consumed (shot on S-VHS and projected onto a large bedsheet in the documentary) is enjoyed not as an immersive, seductive object in itself, but as a shadow - a crudely appealing one, perhaps, but only part of a larger phenomenon its singular viewership is made privy to. Such insider knowledge is likely connected to another spectator pleasure for these ad hoc screenings and the form of community theater they require. This is the pleasure of laughing, with perfect authority, at the otherwise hidden machinations of the Hollywood product, a staple of motion picture entertainment in the impoverished regions Burmeister works in, whether consumed through recorded tape or disc, television, or - much less frequently - the traditional film venue.",1375315200,,5602,5.414662084765178
