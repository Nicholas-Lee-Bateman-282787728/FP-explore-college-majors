5790966,3,B00DCRE2IY,"The movie was certainly nothing like the cover.  There was nothing supernatural about it unless you count the last few minutes when he was running away from the police and was running up in the air.  He couldn't follow through on that because he had just given blood to a suicidal student.  Obviously, he loved his students more than he cared for strangers who wanted to die.
The movie was slow to the point of tedium.
The nerdy biology teacher was living a double life as a part-time vampire.  The teacher reminded me of Johnny Depp in The Secret Window--with his long hair, glasses, dimples, and short stature.  He was even taking care of his mother who had dementia but warned him at the end about the police. You could kind of tell it was not written as an American product.
There was no real horror in killing somebody gently if they wanted to be killed because they couldn't seem to carry out a suicide on their own.  He was more a modern-day Dr. Korvorkian or a gentle serial killer.  The writer left much too much to the imagination like how he became a vampire.
There was a scene where the gentle nerd watched a would-be ""vampire"" rape a girl while smothering her with a plastic bag.  Our ""vampire"" only got indignant, he didn't try to stop it.
If he was a vampire, he was too timid to try to fight or handle conflict in his quest for blood.  He even got sick on blood from the victim at the beginning of the movie.  I would guess that was because the blood was cold.  There was one tender scene near the end where he could not take the blood from another suicidal girl who he took the time to get to know in their walk out of the woods.  She promised to give him blood willingly if he would stop killing the suicidal.  So, a relationship was starting there, but was interrupted by the police.  I would suspect that no faithful vampire fan would buy it or want to own it.",1391904000,,1880,4.319088319088319
5790967,3,B00DCRE2IY,"I went into the film knowing it came from a Japanese director/writer who made a few fine films. Didn't know it was just a human, so I was confused at the beginning until it became clear that the story was playing a little bit on the modern day conception of vampires in a story about a very conflicted individual. There are many places the film shines, the cinematography in some spots was great, very atmospheric and absorbing once you get past the story not being about immortal vampires. Where it hiccups though, is an unnecessary though short sequence when the main character goes to a vampire club. They have many things like this in Japan, but here it just seemed unrealistic, especially the person he encounters there who proceeds to do something that seems mostly done for shock value. If that had been removed I'd have given the film four stars. Also, there are some places where the dialogue seems off, though I think this isn't so off putting if it is taken into account that the writer only had passable English and directed the actors to try and make it more natural. Overall, good film worth checking out if you have an idea of what you're getting into and not just looking at the cover and thinking ""hmm, interesting b-flick let's give it a go"".",1389139200,,1260,4.579646017699115
5790968,4,B00DCRE2IY,"I went into this knowing what it was. The twist in the end was actually really good. I wasn't shocked that it wasn't a supernatural thriller. Nonetheless, it was a psychologically disturbing movie that I was able to watch all the way through until the end. It has a very dark and understated theme.",1386460800,3,298,4.537037037037037
5790969,1,B00DCRE2IY,Don't waste your money on this movie. It's probably the very worse movie I have ever seen. Very bad overacting at best. Undoubtedly the worse movie I have ever seen :(,1381795200,,167,4.419354838709677

5790971,1,B00DCRE2IY,"The description of the movie on the cover is false to a point. This movie is not about the undead variety of Vampire.  It is about Humans drinking human blood, and they do not need it to survive.  They are not harmed by sun light, they can eat regular food, and they have all the regular weaknesses of humans.  This movie is about murder, suicide, and rape.  I was expecting some supernatural component to the movie when I got it and it had non.  It is a very dark very sick movie.  It is not a horror film. This movie will not stay in my collection.",1379203200,8,550,4.1415094339622645
5790972,5,B00DCRE2IY,"I rented this movie without knowing the severe consequences. I rented it like any stupid chap and experienced the worst movie ever made. I laughed all the way to my bed! Then it started to happen.... It started slowly, like common household items disappearing. I thought I was misplacing things until the voices started. They were but whispers in the night until they grew louder. SHUT UP you can't stop me from making this review! My eyes started to bleed. My family members were fellow viewers of this film and one by one they went insane! My brother started eating his own arm. My sister cut off her ears to try and stop the noises! Please do not rent this film it is only plagued by death and despair. It will haunt your dreams and your life! You've been warned. To not purchase this film!!!",1378684800,6,795,4.489655172413793

5790976,2,B00DCRE2IY,"Vampire is a 2011 film by the Japanese filmmaker Shunji Iwai. Over 15 years, he's built an international reputation as arguably the best director of art films in Japan. His&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-About-Lily-Chou-Chou/dp/B0006Z2NCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All About Lily Chou-Chou</a>&nbsp;is a masterpiece, and his other films are well-respected by viewers who could be called the Criterion Collection crowd.

Vampire is Iwai's first English-language feature, and unfortunately it's a colossal dud. To the point where the studio apparently, in an effort to recoup anything -- anything -- from its investment, has dumped the movie onto Amazon with a stock horror image that has nothing to do with the film itself and does not even have Iwai's name on the cover.

What went wrong? For starters, I don't believe Iwai is fluent in English. Many fine films have been made where the director and cast did not speak the same language, but Vampire is not among them. Just as in the film Blueberry Nights -- in which the sometimes great Wong Kar Wai managed to completely squander the considerable  talents of Jude Law and Natalie Portman -- here you have an A-list Asian director completely out of his element. The tone of this film is perennially off. Although the script has been rendered in idiomatic English, the rhythm of the characters interacting is too artificial. It's too theatrical (in the worst sense), and difficult to get sucked into this world.

The actors do their best with the material they were given.

Iwai is a master of imagery, and he does squeeze some drops of brilliance in some images that bear his usual creative stamp, but it's not enough to rescue the film.",1419292800,2,1737,5.278985507246377

5790981,5,B00DCRE2IY,"I really liked this movie. What Dexter is for the serial killer community, that is Simon for the Vampires: a killer with a heart/conscience (who even donates blood!!). However, while Dexter focusses on the crime story, Vampire is not an action/not the typical Vampire movie, but rather a sensitive drama/art film with comedy and thriller elements. Not for every Vampire fan, but a definitive win for the open-minded filmfan, as well as for fans of the talented Kevin Zegers (Transamerica) or the exquisite female cast (I really liked that Rachael Leigh-Cook was cast against type!). If you enjoy good film-making/character studies and do not expect/insist on the usual blockbuster-Vampire action movie, give this excellent movie a chance!",1408579200,,738,5.316239316239316

If you enjoyed The Habit, Martin, The Reflecting Skin, Octane, then this will be up your alley.

The only bad reviews I see here are people who are angry the movie didn't live up to their expectations.  The movie itself was a slice of life through the eyes of someone who's sanity and reality are questions never answered.  But the question itself was an entrancing blend of hesitant atmosphere, precarious innocence, disturbing circumstances and, perhaps for most, an unwelcome acknowledgement of the depths of human imagination and impulse while for the few, the oddly comforting dissonance of resonant echoes.",1451347200,4,719,5.119658119658119
