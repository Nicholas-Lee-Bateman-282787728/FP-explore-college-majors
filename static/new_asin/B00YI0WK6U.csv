8718308,5,B00YI0WK6U,OMG! I LOVED this drama and seeing the BTS helped me to understand how they made it seem like the main actors really did play their own instruments. I'm a music teacher and I have to say they did a superb job of convincing me. All the actors looked like they really enjoyed filming and going to work each day. Shim Eunkyung and Joo Won were so compatible as actors and it was so fun to see them interact behind the scenes. I've watched it three times already!,1451088000,,459,4.2272727272727275
