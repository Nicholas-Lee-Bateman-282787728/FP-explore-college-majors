8239687,1,B0010ZR16K,It's no good to me it's not in English.,1489190400,,39,3.4444444444444446
8239688,4,B0010ZR16K,"The main attraction that brought me to purchase this DVD was the wushu documentary featuring Jet Li, and boy was I pleasantly surprised, given the fact that like most wushu documentaries featuring Jet Li, Shaolin Fists contains exemplary footage showcasing Jet Li at his best, performing traditional forms of wushu, exhibiting excellent form in both armed and unarmed martial arts, as well as some of the most awesome displays by wushu exponents demonstrating traditional forms, both armed and unarmed, and combat demonstrations ever captured on film; although the calibre of wushu performances only begin to pick up 45 minutes through the film and the Jet Li performances are in reality an exact duplicate of those found in Dragons of the Orient - which happens to be a very much better wushu documentary. Having said that, highly recommended for those who haven't seen Dragons of the Orient or are unable to find a copy to purchase over Amazon - that don't ship internationally on some of their products; for Shaolin Fists constitute an excellent documentary on the training undergone by the monks at Shaolin temple as well as their disciples, and even features remarkable demonstrations of chi-kung, where the monks are bashing logs and their limbs against one another's body, hitting and punching with extreme force; including tremendous displays of skill exhibited by the monks training and fighting on wooden stumps as well as going round in circles on top of inverted bowls at great speed in what constitute incredible feats of Chinese wushu.

The second documentary pertaining to Shaolin kung fu comprises an instructional video demonstrating the traditional form of Shaolin 5 Tiger Killing Broad Sword techniques performed slowly so as to enable martial arts enthusiasts to use the video for instructional purposes. The documentary is less than impressive except during the end credits, where there are exceptional displays of armed and unarmed martial arts practitioners demonstrating the traditional forms.

The third documentary, Original Boxing Tree Series 16 Nanyuan Big Arms-through Boxing Routine 3, comprises of another instructional video demonstrating how to perform this traditional form for students and serious practitioners, and serves as another training guide; also performed with somewhat slow speed in order to allow disciples to follow the traditional forms precisely so as to enable them to avoid making costly mistakes. It also concludes with phenomenal demonstrations of both armed and unarmed forms.

The fourth documentary, The Traditional Shaolin Original Boxing Tree Series 18 Big Canon Boxing, is probably the best instructional video of Shaolin moves of the three - featuring impressive demonstrations by Shaolin monks and, like the rest, culminates with awesome displays of armed and unarmed demonstrations of traditional wushu forms.

The fifth documentary, The Traditional Kung Fu Series 48 of Original Boxing Tree Appreciation of Boxing and Weapon, is probably the worst instructional documentary of the lot but, nevertheless, culminates with the same impressive footage that bookmarks all four training videos.

And, the ninth movie, Shaolin Ex-Monk, is best feature film of the lot, comprising of five movies, that features awesome martial arts choreography and incredible fight scenes with the most impressive occurring in the middle of the movie.

However, the other four movies are less than satisfactory when it comes to martial arts action, coupled with the fact that I've already watched three of the five movies with the third movie, Kid from Tibet, constituting a poor showcase of Shaolin kung fu with very little martial arts action; and the movie being bogged down by a heavy script.

Further to this, Disc A - which contains Jet Li's Shaolin Fists, is defective, with sound only coming from the left speaker. You have to use the mono mode in order to get the sound to issue forth from both the left and right channel. Furthermore, nearly the entire length of Disc D, featuring the instructional demonstration of Shaolin moves, is defective with the sound being punctuated with minute bits of silence throughout.

However, if you're an aficionado of Jet Li and truly want a Jet Li documentary featuring him at his best and are unable to obtain a copy of Dragons of the Orient or This is Kung Fu, and are willing to live with the defect, then, by all means add this anthology of Shaolin features to your collection.",1400112000,,4467,5.229050279329609
8239689,1,B0010ZR16K,You'll see Jet Li for less than 2 minutes.  Old movies.  Complete waste of money.,1237334400,,81,4.333333333333333
8239690,3,B0010ZR16K,"This DVD collection is an odd mix - part kung fu action films and part 'how to ...'.  As the mix is odd, so is the quality.  This varies from the standard, not to clear, quality of the early Hong Kong films to some very poor quality material that looks almost as if it had been shot with an 8-millimeter camera and then transferred to 16 mil film and then transferred to DVD (with the possibility of a few other transfers in between).  The kung fu movies are the standard simplistic plot stories that provide an excuse for the principles to ""get it on.""  The 'how to' sections are interesting to watch and informative, although I believe that it would be difficult to learn some of the material from simply having a video (however good) of the the actions.",1208822400,2,756,4.41726618705036
8239691,4,B0010ZR16K,"If you like anything that has to do with Shaolin, this is a must have for your collection. The footage of Shaolin, it's Masters & their training is rare to find. You will get alot of instructional video footage from very famous Shaolin Monks as well. The ""Kung Fu movies"" that are included are o.k. but the highlight video is without a doubt the Shaolin Fists. You will see some footage of Jet Li performing when he was very young as well. Well worth the price. circleoflifekungfu.com",1206748800,4,484,4.574712643678161
8239692,1,B0010ZR16K,"The other reviewer got it right. Don't know if he bought this DVD or not, but I sure did. I have it in my hands, and have not the slightest urge to open it. In fact, I am going to return it to Amazon. But I should let everybody know why - so it could save you the hassle.

Off the bat, the cover reads ""Join Jet Li and top masters from Sholin along with best Shaolin films in one spectacular 10 feature set."" There's your clue to know right away that they are not all Jet Li movies. It has just one ""feature"" called Jet Li's Shaolin Fists, and from what I could tell, it is a documentary on Jet Li's training days. The rest of the non-Jet Li ""features"" are:  Shaolin Traitor, Shaolin Red Master, Shaolin Ex-Monk, Incredible Shaolin Kung Fu, Kid from Tibet, Nanyuan Boxing, Body Weapon, 5 Tiger Sword, and Cannon Boxing. It definitely does not list ""Bodyguard from Beijing"" - as wrongly described by Amazon.

This is a huge disappointment for a Jet Li fan. That's me. So I gave it a 1 star. In all fairness, it could be worthwhile for a Shaolin martial arts fan. But not for me!",1205798400,9,1077,4.218446601941747
8239693,2,B0010ZR16K,"I'm checking this DVD edition like crazy, based on this incredible ""bargain"" that this Jet Li compilation seems to be. Mostly, because i know by heart the official filmography of Jet Li before his major breakthrought ""Once Upon a time in China"". And i mean shaolin films, period films, training videos or whatever. Something's not right, i assure you.

Why: 780 minutes on 2 DVD discs? So much for the quality don't you think? And 10 ""movies"" for 14 dollars? Of jet Li, the biggest seller in martial arts industry in both Asia and Hollywood? I can't seem to recognize some of these films posted, are these ""alternative"" names for known films, new films, hidden material, Jet Li's favourite films or training videos? I don't know, but one thing i'm sure: This is not a compilation of Jet Li's early ""Shaolin"" films. This compilation smells like these old Bruce ""Li"" or ""le"" movies, or maybe some Jet Li appereances, bogus material or who knows.

Careful with this edition, at least untill more information comes about this ""collection"". Some serious research is recommended before you fall into tempation. Because that seems to be the intention here, to catch unprevented fish.

There's absolutely no logic about the incredible amount of posted material, about a big-selling international star, inside 780 minutes in 2 DVD discs, for this price. I smell a rat.",1205452800,2,1359,4.925764192139738
