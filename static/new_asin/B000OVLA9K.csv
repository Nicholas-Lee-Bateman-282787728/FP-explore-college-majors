8186851,4,B000OVLA9K,Randall Willson did a great job with this Documentary.  Covers a lot of areas concerning the Biker culture in general.  Even covers some Abatement group efforts...(An often forgotten aspect of Motorcycling).,1485129600,,207,5.645161290322581
8186852,3,B000OVLA9K,Not good but not bad. Long.. a lot to do with 1% MC's...,1459209600,,56,3.3846153846153846
8186853,4,B000OVLA9K,It is a very comprehensive look at motorcycling and the biker culture in America.  I thought it chronicled the evolution of the bike and the culture very well.,1430956800,,159,4.678571428571429
8186854,5,B000OVLA9K,"Lonnnng!  2:45  i think?

Nice documentary of the birth of the Outlaw Biker!!!  A lot of neat boozefighter stuff and chuck zito does a nice job of commenting on the Hells Angels.  Law Enforcement and Biker Clubs are discussed and add a bit of objectivity.

Overall and very well done documentary that I have watched over and over again between rides!",1394841600,,350,4.655737704918033
8186855,5,B000OVLA9K,"I wanted this movie given it gives a good point of view on motorcycle history; however I was very concerned on its only review saying there was no disk in the case.  Thank goodness, yes I got my movie.  I viewed and all is well.  This was a long movie compared to the new one out called Why We Ride.  Why We Ride is like 90 mins as this one is over 2 hrs.  Both are good in their own ways.  This one is older but a great view.",1391472000,,426,3.730337078651685
8186856,1,B000OVLA9K,"I opened it and...nothing inside.  This is a first.  There was a flier for other biker DVDS, but no movie.  Huh...",1363219200,,114,4.333333333333333
