7997289,5,B0000AINQ8,"Maria Felix radiates on screen in ""EL RAPTO"", with a stunning performance that transcends the language barrier to make this a compelling film for all audiences.  American video consumers are beginning to discover some of the quality programs from the international marketplace (e.g., ""Amelie"" or ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"") and are no longer seeing the dialogue language as a barrier to the enjoyment and clear communication presented in certain superb examples of international cinema such as ""EL RAPTO"".  This is a wonderful film, and a classic in any country.",1061769600,4,561,5.292134831460674
