8204876,1,B000SAAT6M,"One of these days someone is going to make an interesting and intelligent documentary on the subject of the 1938 WAR OF THE WORLDS panic, but this isn't it.

THE ORSON WELLES' WAR OF THE WORLDS SCANDAL is basically a collection of still photographs and narration that repeats the same unproven, antedotal information we've all heard a hundred times or more.  There's nothing new, and there's nothing worth seeing, and there's nothing worth hearing.  In fact, it is difficult to find anything to say about this so-called documentary at all beyond noting that it is a complete waste of time and money.

The Day That Panicked America: The H.G. Wells War of the Worlds Scandal (2005)

That title ran 74 min. and was hosted by John Ross. It was a 2-disc, the second being an audio CD of the original radio broadcast. These two items sound so similar, and I have the 2005 issue. Perhaps other WOTW fans out there need confirmation as well.",1185148800,10,811,6.043478260869565
