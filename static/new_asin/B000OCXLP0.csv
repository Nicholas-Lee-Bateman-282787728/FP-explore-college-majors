2794225,4,B000OCXLP0,"My copy of "" Blood and Chocolate"" by Annette Curtis Klause deteriorated over the numerous times I read and lent it. When I happened upon the movie preview I was ecstatic, of course, but life forced me to wait till it was available online.

This is not the same story as the book, sadly, but it is a great story nonetheless. Setting the werewolves in Europe instead of America gives the tale the a naturally dark tone but it is an overall happier story than the book. It is a movie I will watch again, sometime in the future, but not one worthy of a physical copy on my limited shelf space.

Comparison to the book-
I was sad to see the pain of transforming from human to wolf did not make it into the movie. That was a huge theme through the book which drew the reader to continue. That is my biggest complaint of the movie but I understand it is difficult to translate. The pack dynamic which forced her end decision in the book is not the same in the movie, unfortunately. I won't spoil the ending. The book is easy to read and does not take long to finish.

If you like this genre READ THE BOOK!",1407715200,6,1098,4.194312796208531
2794226,5,B000OCXLP0,This movie was pleasantly surprising -- a romantic psychodrama with a deeply sociological theme. The actors and the filmography is excellent; you can tell that professionals created this movie. It is not a B-list flick by any means. Definitely one of the better werewolf movies out there.,1407628800,4,288,5.148936170212766
2794227,4,B000OCXLP0,"It was a very action packed, mind twisting, romantic book that will keep you wanting more.",1407283200,,90,4.6875
2794228,3,B000OCXLP0,"Just another werewolf movie. It was just okay. If you have nothing else to do and want to watch something quite mindless, this would be the perfect movie for that.",1406851200,,163,4.466666666666667
2794229,5,B000OCXLP0,Great movie!,1406160000,,12,5.5
2794230,5,B000OCXLP0,"I am so excited to see Amazon have this movie available digitally. I own the DVD already.
Why do I love it you ask... it is a combination of a star-crossed lover movie, across species (wolf vs human) and a suspense action movie. It reminds me of Twilight, but with better suspense and a faster romance. A milder version of Underworld, but similar concept.
The wolves and the city are beautiful.",1402358400,9,394,4.563380281690141

2794232,3,B000OCXLP0,I absolutely loved this book and I kniw that most movies are not like the movies that follow but this was so different it just barely followed the plot line!  If I would I have not read and loved the book so much it might have sat better with me but I honestly just didn't enjoy it all tat much.,1472083200,3,295,3.9166666666666665

2794235,5,B000OCXLP0,"Loved it! I thought the preformances from the lead actors were great as were the performances of the minor actors. However, the two things I loved the most was a move giving you the true history/legands of werewolves and that this movie is told in the female prospective. I've never seen a film about werewolves told solely by the female lead. Only in small parts of Twilight when Leah becomes  wolf do you get any idea how the female wolf feels. And sadly with Twilight you get Leah's feelings on the subject in the book far, far more than in any of the 3 movies where she has become a wolf. I highly recommend this one. It's a great romance flick but its great to hear the history of creatures of the lore. Did I mention I totally loved it? Oh, I did. Good, just checking.",1462579200,2,774,4.301369863013699

2794238,4,B000OCXLP0,"First, fair disclosure: I'll watch pretty much anything that lists Hugh Dancy as part of the cast. He's an incredibly adept and versatile actor; with an amazing ear for spot-on accents, plus the added genetic bonus of endearingly boyish good looks. For me, this formidable combination often turns him into a film's most enjoyable focal point -- even when the material fails him. It sorta fails him here, but not entirely; and in my opinion, not enough to make this a bad film. If you remember reading (and enjoying) the YA novel of the same name, you may be in for a disappointment given some key differences. But I went into this with pretty ""meh"" expectations given crabby critic reviews, and was pleasantly surprised at the fairly solid storytelling. On the plus side, I especially appreciate that the filmmakers avoided cheesy wolf-transformation attempts altogether -- their budget probably couldn't support believable practical effects, and ""Twilight""-variety CGI would have been atrocious. On the negative side, I know the ""pain"" aspect of transformation was a key part of the novel, so that gets lost in translation here. But aside from a few dialog clunkers and a somewhat muddled conclusion, I found this to be a pretty stylish tale of forbidden love on the run. Both leads are appealing, and Olivier Martinez does a decent job of playing an antagonist who's not truly a villain or bad guy -- just trying, in his own way, to preserve a noble heritage. Definite ""Underworld"" echoes (no surprise given who's behind it), but things keep moving along at a pretty absorbing pace.",1457913600,2,1584,4.958646616541353

2794243,1,B000OCXLP0,"wow am i sad... the end of the book when gabriel and vivian fall in love. Gabriel was supppose to be the good guy. This was nothing like the book, they took a good book and made a s***** movie. Very disappointed.",1441497600,4,212,4.071428571428571
2794244,2,B000OCXLP0,It's really not a good movie from a technical standpoint - some of the editing is so clumsy it made me burst out laughing. For Hugh Dancy completists only - and/or people desperate for a werewolf movie.,1438473600,,202,4.486486486486487

2794256,5,B000OCXLP0,"I thought the movie was really good. Some of the reviewers posted that it was predictable but I did not. I love to watch movies that are different and this fit the bill. I guess when this was made, Oliver Martinez and Hugh Dancy were not well not. Both did great jobs in this movie. I'm not a critic or anything, just CRAZY about movies.

However, that was around 9-10 years ago, so i can't say how the movie compares to the book but I really quite enjoyed it. I liked the music and i also really really liked how they transformed into wolves - very fitting with the story line. I will definitely re-watch in a few years",1409529600,,354,4.220588235294118

8184607,2,B000OCXLP0,Its like Twilight with only werewolves. Surprised Hugh Dancy would have been involved in such a shallow film. It was 10 years ago before he was as well known as he is now. Perhaps he was young and he needed the money......,1523232000,,222,4.309523809523809
