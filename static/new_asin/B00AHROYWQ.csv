The trailer (easily found on YouTube) does a great job of selling it as an exciting and intricate time-slip adventure/thriller, though the finished product is quite different.

In 2005, Alice Tanner is volunteering on an archaeology site in the in the Sabarthes Mountains when she is drawn to a hidden cave in the hills. There she finds two skeletons clasping each other, with a mysterious book and ring with a labyrinthine design lying between them. As Alice continues to explore the old cities and ruins of southwest France, she's haunted by vivid dreams and a strong sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, and eventually her discoveries put her in the orbit of a rich and powerful antiquarian called Marie-Cecile de l'Oradore, a woman who has been searching for the Holy Grail her entire life.

In 1209, seventeen year old Alas is a young wife who lives with her husband, father and sister at Chateau Comtal, a citadel under the protection of the very young Viscount Raymond-Roger Trencavel. One morning she goes to fetch herbs on the riverbank and discovers the dead body of a man in the water, his throat cut and his thumb removed. With that discovery, her father reveals to her his long-held secret: that he is one of the guardians of three books that contain the secrets of the Holy Grail. To complicate matters, an army from the north of France is invading Carcassona in order to eradicate the Cathar heretics. As the Viscount prepares for a siege, Alas's father decides to unite the three books and entrust them to his youngest daughter, much to the jealousy and resentment of her elder sister Oriane.

Both past and present intersect when both women are drawn into the hunt for the Holy Grail, aided by those who protect it and threatened by those who covet it for themselves. It theory it all sounds thrilling: female protagonists, ancient conspiracies, an historical mystery, and of course the allure of the ever-elusive Holy Grail. The problem is that - much like the book - the execution of this premise just doesn't gel properly. An adaptation would have been the perfect way to iron out some of the inconsistencies and odd pacing decisions of the book, but instead the screenplay only adds more problems.

Simply put, the story is immensely cluttered and it's difficult to pin down what any character is trying to do at any given time. Practically every line of dialogue is exposition, explaining everyone's feelings, relationships, motivation and thoughts without the slightest attempt made to actually *show* us. There's no real sense of urgency to the procedings and with only a few exceptions the characters are rather one-dimensional. Though the second half is better than the first, the resolution is painfully anticlimatic and it's strewn with weird inconsistencies.

For instance, at the start of the story Alas's father warns her about Oriane's untrustworthy nature, telling her that she must be on her guard around her. At about the mid-point Alas comes to him with concerns that Oriane is plotting against them, only for him to pish-posh what she's trying to tell him. Huh?

Then there's Marie-Cecile, who inexplicably gives her boy-toy free run of her estate while she's busy sacrificing people in the garage. And Paul Authie the assassin, who decides to make a phone-call while he's still wearing gloves bloodied from his latest victim. And Alice, who stupidly decides to explore an underground cave mere seconds after an earthquake dislodges several large rocks from the hill above it. And Oriane, who is magically able to react to a man silently shaking his head in response to her question, even though she's fully turned away from him at the time. The villains are walking clich&eacute;s, though I have to admit I'm fond of the line: ""I'll make honest Christians of these people, even if I have to kill every last one of them to do it."" See anything a tad illogic in that sentiment?

Look, every film or story is bound to have a couple of silly moments, but this is just one nonsensical thing after another.

On the plus side, the high production values mean that ""Labyrinth"" is beautiful to watch if nothing else: the locations, the costumes, the sets - it's all high quality and the designers manage to strike a nice balance between the natural beauty of the world and the more uncompromising realities of life in the 13th century. The soundtrack is suitably evocative and the actors ries to the occasion, determined do their best with an incredibly clunky script. Jessica Brown Findlay has the most success as Alas, though her contemporary counterpart Vanessa Kirby wanders around with a perpetually blank expression. Katie McGrath plays another bad girl akin to her role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merlin/dp/B00C4UR3PO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merlin</a>, but manages to portray Oriane as quite a different creature than Morgana, whilst Sebastian Stan provides shirtless eye-candy as what amounts to Alice's bland love interest. John Hurt slums it in a minor role, and Tom Felton plays against type as the heroic young Viscount Trencavel.

As you've probably guessed, the medieval plotline is more successful than its contemporary counterpart: the pacing might be a little slower, but at least it's not as convoluted. That said, it doesn't shed much like on the historical persecution of the Cathars upon which Kate Mosse's book is based, simplifying the issue into Cathers: tolerant and mystical, Catholics: fantatical and greedy.

I wanted to love ""Labyrinth"", I really did, and I was hopeful that a TV adapation could take the potential of Mosse's wonderful premise and improve on its awkward execution. But it was not to be. It's entertaining, it's well-acted and it's beautifully filmed - but it's just not very good.",1385078400,2,6290,5.338042381432896
