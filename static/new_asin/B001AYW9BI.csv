Americans should know about how Mossadeq, the elected PM of Iran was removed by the CIA for the benefit of Anglo-Iranian Oil (now British Petroleum) when the British government told Eisenhower that Mossadeq was a Communist.  Mossadeq's crime was that he had nationalized Iran's oil when Anglo-Iranian refused to give Iran more money for their oil.  Mossadeq threw the British out, and they screamed bloody murder.

When Mossadeq was removed, the Shah was installed.  The Shah proved a faithful puppet and was the recipient of much American aid, including weapons.  While Americans were unaware of this intrigue, the Iranians knew it, and this resulted in the overthrow of the Shah, and the taking of American hostages.",1377561600,,914,4.967105263157895
