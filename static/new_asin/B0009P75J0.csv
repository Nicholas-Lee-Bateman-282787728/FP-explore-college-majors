One spot in particular is the poignant scene where Judge Priest is talking to his departed wife in their room as he stands before her picture. The early part is there, but then this version cuts abruptly to the cemetery scene. The full version gives greater depth to the character. I have no idea why this was felt necessary.  What a dissapointment.",1183334400,30,599,4.685714285714286

2308128,4,B0009P75J0,"John Ford is my favorite director.  I have no problem watching his movies a 9th and 10th time but I'm doing my best to see as many of his movies as I can.  Recently I had a chance to see 5 movies of his that I hadn't seen before.  Some were pretty good and I would put ""Judge Priest"" in that category.  This is a movie about the post-Civil War South (in Kentucky).  One man, Judge Priest, makes a difference in his community by standing fast for what he feels is right.  He does so by his innocent ""Aw Shucks"" manner that threatens no one but gradually persuades many.  The movie culminates in a trial that culminates in a brilliant testimony by a former Confederate officer that is the single scene highlight of the movie.  Overall, I would actually rate this movie a 3 Star but for the first opportunity I've ever had to witness the style of the great American Humorist, Will Rogers.  I know he is working from a script but one gets a pretty clear picture as to how this man rose to such popularity.  Imagine that there was a movie that you could watch and hear Mark Twain in a leading role!

2308204,4,B0009P75J0,"""Dr. Bull"" and ""Judge Priest"" are two of Will Rogers' best films, here brought together on one disc.  Both were directed by a young John Ford.  Here are short comments on the two:

DOCTOR BULL
----------------
In this agreeable, satisfying, and entertaining film, ""Doc Bull"" is the only physician in a small Connecticut town, on call at all times, beginning to feel his age, and trying hard to keep up with progress in medicine. He is a widower whose friendship with a local widow provides grist for town gossips. A typhoid outbreak tests him and the town.

The first reason to watch the film is to see the fine performance by Rogers, amusing at some times, poignant in others.

The second reason is to glimpse life in America in the 1930s. Doctors made house calls. Mail came by train. Telephone operators connected every call by hand, and from listening to the conversations knew everything that went on. (In one scene, Rogers has a fine rant against the telephone. It sounds just like our generation cursing the blackberry.)

There's a social issue in the film. In the 1930s many Americans still put a great emphasis on a family's ""stock"" (its origins), and the older generation wanted to match young adults only with proper and approved mates of the same religion and class. Dr. Bull has a more liberal view. Perhaps this was one of the movies that helped move America toward its socially more democratic future.

JUDGE PRIEST
----------------
Directed by John Ford and starring Will Rogers and Hattie McDaniel, there's a lot to like in this 1934 hit. It is set in 1890 in a Kentucky town still strongly Confederate in its identity. When town louts frame a local man for assault, there is a trial. Along the way, Judge Priest (Will Rogers plays the title role) helps his nephew overcome family opposition to marrying his sweetheart.

The film has a big negative, but first let's first count its virtues:

-- ""Judge Priest"" conveys a strong feeling of affection and nostalgia for the small town past. Modern viewers will enjoy the glimpses of an earlier time -- the manners and dress, the men playing croquet in the evening, a taffy pull, shaving mugs at the barber shop, and so on.

-- The performance by Will Rogers is affecting. He is humorous, poignant, or earnest in different scenes.

-- The film showcased Hattie McDaniel's fine voice. When Will Rogers joins in two of her songs, the result is memorable, if only because the two were so musically mismatched.

All that said, the movie has a BIG negative -- its portrayal of race in the South after the Civil War. I doubt that 1930s audiences thought much about this thread in the film, considering it a comedy or light drama. But of course times have changed, and we look at then-accepted characterizations differently. Here's some ""parental guidance.""

-- Hattie McDaniel plays Judge Priest's cook and housekeeper. Her Oscar-winning role in ""Gone with the Wind"" drew on some of the same screen persona, and all seems happy and bright. There's no allusion to the burdens of Jim Crow. When she sings ""My Old Kentucky Home,"" she sings the old words, and it now hurts to hear the original lyric.

-- In the film's opening courtroom scene, Judge Priest calls ""Jeff Poindexter,"" an adult African-American defendant, ""boy,"" and he questions him sharply.  Jeff is played by Stepin Fetchit, whose screen persona in this film is simple-minded.  To be sure, Judge Priest acquits Poindexter, and the two go fishing together and are friends for the rest of the movie.  Still, I would not recommend the movie for children or even teenagers, lest impressionable young people absorb the demeaning impression.

For an aware and sensitive adult, however, the outdated portrayals of race, running parallel with other themes in the movie, make it possible to wring some good out of the film.  Like ""Gone with the Wind,"" ""Judge Priest"" shades (or warps or distorts) the past. It stands somewhere on a continuum between, say, ""Birth of a Nation"" and ""Roots.""  The questions to ask are ""what are the film's retrograde and progressive portrayals?"" and ""what does this 1934 film portend for the progress of equality that came in the last third of the twentieth century?""

--  The film showcased Hattie McDaniel's fine voice.  When Will Rogers joins in two of her songs, the result is memorable, if only because the two were so musically mismatched.

--  There's a social issue in the film.  A century ago, many Americans prided themselves on a family's national or ethnic origins, its ""stock.""  Parents and relatives wanted to match young people with proper and approved mates.  Judge Priest has a more tolerant view, open to character and accomplishment.  Perhaps this was one of the movies that helped move America toward its socially more democratic future.

All that said, the movie has a BIG negative -- its portrayal of race in the South after the Civil War.  I doubt that 1930s audiences thought much about this thread in the film, considering it a comedy or light drama.

There's no allusion to the burdens of Jim Crow.  When she sings ""My Old Kentucky Home,"" she sings the old words, and it now hurts to hear the original lyric.

--  More jarring is the film's opening scene.  In the courtroom Judge Priest calls Jeff Poindexter, an adult African-American defendant, ""boy,"" and he questions him sharply.  That the use of ""boy"" was indeed widespread, that Judge Priest acquits the defendant and the two later go fishing and are friends through the rest of the movie, does not quite make up for the jolt.

-- Jeff was played by Stepin Fetchit.  Although he was a pathbreaker in Hollywood, the first African-American star to become a millionaire, he came to represent -- take it from Wikipedia -- ""a stereotype of the servile, shiftless, simple-minded black man in early 20th century American film.""  In this film, the role leans toward simple-minded.

--  Some scholars now reinterpret Perry's portrayals as ""ultimately subversive of the status quo,"" using ""a common manipulation technique used by blacks to mitigate their status by pretending to be unintelligent and fulfilling the low expectations of whites.""  Viewers can make up their own minds, of course, but my take is that the reinterpretation is too academic; few viewers of this film are likely to react in that scholarly way.  They are likely to absorb the plain characterization.  I would not, then, recommend the movie for children or even teenagers, lest impressionable young people absorb the bad impression.

For an aware and sensitive adult, however, the outdated portrayals of race, running parallel with other themes in the movie, make it possible to wring some good out of the film.  For instance:

--  All who are interested in knowing the true past must untangle how it has been represented -- in the classroom, in literature, and in film -- on the way to grasping the reality.  Like ""Gone with the Wind,"" ""Judge Priest"" shades (or warps or distorts) the past.  It stands somewhere on a continuum between, say, ""Birth of a Nation"" and ""Roots.""  What are the film's retrograde and progressive portrayals?

--  The film's director, John Ford (1894-1973), was a giant of American cinema.

 ---  Ford's 1955 film, ""The Sun Shines Bright,"" is also based on Cobb's ""Judge Priest"" stories.  Stepin Fetchit reprised his role as Jeff Poindexter.  The 1955 film includes a plot line involving a lynching -- an element that had been removed from the first script of ""Judge Priest.""

 ---  The portrayal of the African-American characters in ""Judge Priest"" and the ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (with Woody Strode playing Pompey) offer two snapshots of Ford's mind, 28 years apart.  How had John Ford changed by 1962?  How had the audiences?

--  ""Judge Priest,"" like many other films of the times, honors the Confederacy and its veterans.  Were these portrayals part of sectional healing (among whites), even as Jim Crow neutered the Civil War's emancipation of slaves?

Finally, ""Judge Priest"" opens with a quotation from the early 20th century American humorist, Irvin S. Cobb (1876-1944), who wrote the original Judge Priest stories.  The judge, he said, seemed ""typical of the tolerance of the day and the wisdom of that almost vanished generation.""  The question to ask of Cobb, John Ford, Will Rogers, Hattie McDaniel, and Stepin Fetchit is the meaning of ""tolerance"" in an America characterized by Jim Crow.

We properly criticize the limits of ""toleration,"" nicely defined by George Washington (speaking of religion) as merely ""the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights.""  Tolerance and toleration are a weak substitute for freedom.  But when societies change, toleration may be the beginning of a journey -- a half-way house, perhaps -- toward affirmation, rights, and equality.  Of course, in a way station or half-way house, as we know from Ford's ""Stagecoach,"" there are some anxious to continue the journey, some who want to return, some who take refuge, and some who profit.  ""Judge Priest"" could help start a good discussion of ""tolerance.""

2308208,1,B0009P75J0,"For those too young to remember, Will Rogers (1879-1935) held a unique place in American culture - so unique it's difficult to describe. Take Johnny Carson, for example, at his prime, and then eliminate any of his competitors, remove him from the commercial arena, and you begin to get a glimpse of how influential Rogers was. Or think Bob Hope at his peak, with no competitors. Rogers was a stage performer, film star, radio star, rodeo star, and stand-up comedian before there was stand up. Journalists hounded him for comments on any major event, and he rarely disappointed them. His witticisms became part of the language. Here's a taste -

* ""America has a unique record. We never lost a war and we never won a conference in our lives.""
* ""Be thankful we're not getting all the government we're paying for.""
* ""Everything is changing. People are taking the comedians seriously and the politicians as a joke.""
* ""I belong to no organized party, I'm a Democrat.""
* ""A senator got up today in Congress and called his fellow senators sons of wild jackasses. Now, if you think the senators were hot, imagine how the jackasses must feel.""

His life is well told in ""The Story of Will Rogers"" and I highly recommend you see that film. I equally highly recommend you avoid this film, ""Judge Priest"", which is essentially a string of anecdotes in which Rogers, obviously embarrassed by the whole thing (and often hiding behind a newspaper or other object), pretends to be a small town judge.

Amazingly enough, John Ford, liked this film. Ford (1894-1973) made nearly100 films in the silent and early talkie period, most of which are completely forgettable, including one with Rogers (""Doctor Bull"") in 1933. In 1935 he won the Academy Award for ""The Informer,"" the first of his 4 awards for best director. There is nothing special in his work as a director in this film.

Apart from the waste of Roger's talent in this film, the racist stereotyping is even embarrassing for 1934. Hattie McDaniel (1895-1952) and Stephen Fetchitt (1902-85) portray ""darkies"" in the most servile manner.",1305590400,,2081,4.820728291316526

Based on a character in dozens of Irvin S. Cobb stories, JUDGE PRIEST was said to be director John Ford's favorite of all his movies. It's set in the year 1890.

SYNOPSIS--
The Most Mellow Judge 'Willy' Priest (Rogers), possessor of a trove of homespun aphorisms, wears white suits and lives in a small Kentucky town whose citizens remain loyal to the long-dead Confederacy. Proud of his wartime service, this widowed jurist acts as matchmaker to his fresh-out-of-law-school nephew Jerome (Brown).

Priest's sister-in-law objects that Rome's girlfriend, Ellie May Gillespie (Louise) has untraceable bloodlines, as Ellie's mother died in childbirth and her father is nowhere to be found. Willy shields Ellie May from the unwanted attentions of rude-mannered barber Flem Talley (Melton), then he encourages Rome's and Ellie's relationship.

Later, spurned suitor Talley spots the town's anti-social blacksmith, Bob Gillis (Landau) placing flowers on the grave of Ellie's mom. Talley makes a nasty remark about Ellie and Gillis punches him. Talley and two others attack Gillis with pool cues and in defending himself, Bob cuts Talley with a knife. For his very first court case Rome will defend Bob Gillis, the man who stood up for Ellie's honor and was jailed as a result.

This picture has often been condemned for racial stereotyping. Stepin Fetchit's dialect-heavy cat-fishin' courtroom testimony and his harmonica version of ""Marching Through Georgia,"" plus Hattie McDaniel's housemaid-warbling of Stephan Foster 'darky' tunes probably have a lot to do with such brickbats. Undoubtedly, scenes of former slaves marching with Confederate flags while playing ""Dixie"" have also inflamed modern passions.

  Will Rogers is, by turns, humerous, sad, sweet, contemplative, and just plain funny.  The movie has several funny scenes, and one rousing scene near the end. Will Rogers makes everything come out right for the two young lovers.

""Judge Priest"" gives Rogers' a well-crafted showcase as a laid-back court judge with his own brand of horse-sense during the post-Civil War years in the South. When his aspiring nephew, a defense attorney, gets his first break defending a loner civilian with a past (David Landau), Priest is asked to step down to avoid personal bias in the case. What culminates in the climactic court goings-on might rub present day audiences the wrong way in its unabashed American flag waving & obvious appeal for patriotism. But there's no doubt that the stirring appeal is so powerful that it would move even the most stodgiest conservative.
""Doctor Bull"" is a rare treat, a Rogers classic that hasn't been seen in years. As Doctor George Bull, a small town practitioner, Rogers has some wonderful moments both comic & serious. A man who uses his own common sense to treat the community (including hypochondriac Andy Devine), Bull eventually comes under fire by the snootiest of townsfolk who believe his methods are unconventional & harmful. The end result is both touching & satisfying.
I like the convenient slimcase design. And while the films are occasionally fuzzy & scratchy, one has to consider how old these movies are; restoration can do only so much. We should be lucky that these two gems are still around for us to enjoy.",1263945600,7,1569,4.814814814814815

2308225,3,B0009P75J0,"Judge Priest is the story of a small town after the Civil War. The judge likes to meddle in other peoples' affairs, and sometimes he gets to do it and get paid for it. When an outsider in the town gets into a fight with the local barber, the barber takes the outsider to court and demands justice. However, things are not all that they seem and it is up to the judge to make things right.

There is a rousing finale with music and patriotism all bursting forth into an uplifting climax. Unfortunately, the major conflict is never explicitly resolved, so we just have to assume that everything came out alright in the end. The movie plays solely on our emotions for the grand finish.

The gratuitous romance in the film is weak; Brown and Louise come off as being ameatur actors, possibly because of their under-developed characters and juvenile dialogue. The black actors are seen more than in some other movies, but they are certainly stereotyped. After reading about Stepin Fetchit, I find it impossible not to like him, and he indeed provides plenty of laughs, but it is easy to see why modern audiences would be offended by his slow-moving and simple-minded antics. Hattie McDaniel fares a bit better, and most of her scenes are sung, shades of her start on the stage. Rogers is the standout, and rightfully so, since the title of the film is after his character's name. He gets to play his typical, slow-talking and wisdom-imparting self, a lovable character who easily carries the film.

Overall, this is a sweet, enjoyable programmer worth seeing if you're a fan of the director or the cast, but otherwise won't blow you away.",1237161600,4,1633,4.682926829268292

2308228,3,B0009P75J0,"In a sleepy small town in Kentucky during the 1890s, an idiosyncratic judge (the Priest of the title, played by Will Rogers, in one of his last roles) defends the innocence of a taciturn man accused of assailing other town folk, by proving that he was a hero of the Confederacy during the Civil War. If you forget the blatant, unthinking racism of the movie (by the end, you have the dimwitted blacks of the town playing Dixie) and its saccharine sentimentality, this film is a good portrayal of the mores and traditions of the Scotch-Irish (or, if you prefer, the rednecks) that forms the backbone of America's personal character. Also, this movie also shows why Stepin Fetchit was such a controversial performer. Recommended with reservations.",1214265600,,745,4.920634920634921
2308229,1,B0009P75J0,"This film, made in 1934, was painful to watch. The story and script are very simple, with akward and over-the-top acting by most. The script included long, drawn out and very corny speeches by Will Rogers. But that's to be expected, since this film was made during the relatively early years of cinema. And the film quality isn't very good-the picture is very grainy. I also expected that the images and portrayals of African-Americans would be archaic and probably offensive. But I love movies for their historical value too. However, this film's treatment of Black characters is so racist and demeaning that I couldn't see anything else.
