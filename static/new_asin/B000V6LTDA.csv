2931003,3,B000V6LTDA,"This low-budget horror comedy would've been much better if it was played straight without the humor. Like most horror comedies, the constant attempts at humor are unfunny and do nothing but hurt the film. The locations are pretty nice because it takes place around a lagoon, and the film delivers some good misty atmosphere. The directing is mediocre, and the film usually moves at a good pace; but the film sometimes gets a little tedious and uninvolving. The film has a good body count, and it has some gory scenes. However, there're many deaths that are disappointing because there're times when you only see a little gore or none at all; I wanted more gore and more onscreen deaths in a film like this. It also lacks suspense and interesting characters. There's a skinny dipping scene when some men and women both get fully nude, but you can barely see any full frontal nudity. Instead of loading the film with unnecessary attempts at comedy, more nudity and gore would've made this so much better. It's a lively and somewhat fun film for those who like low-budget monster movies. It has its moments, but it could've been much better.

The DVD quality is very good. The menu screens are pretty nice, but there're no chapter stops. There's some trailers, a commentary and some deleted scenes as extras. The deleted scenes are just some more unfunny attempts at comedy.",1389225600,,1371,4.784810126582278
2931004,3,B000V6LTDA,"Hillarious may be a bit of an overstatement, but for those that love campy horrorcomedies, Creature from the Hillbilly Lagoon does deliver it's good share of laughs. It has a lot of ""trying to hard to act"" moments and bad stereotypes (not everyone in the south is named ""Bubba""). Overall, if you love bad movies at least give this one a try. If your looking for a movie full of top-notch special effects, acting, and story development, this is not your movie. Perhaps only a select few will appreciate ""so bad it's good"" movies, if you are one of those people, then this ones for you.",1363996800,,584,4.518867924528302
2931005,4,B000V6LTDA,"Although I had already seen the movie, it was a great movie,if you like that kind of movie. I'm the kind of guy that will never care if it won an oscar or made me cry, just give me a good mindless, funny movie anytime.",1358640000,,218,3.8666666666666667
2931006,1,B000V6LTDA,"This movie was done by people from Conn.who do not know the diff,between Redneck,and Hillbilly.as a matter of fact,it would appear that a friend had a camera,and said lets do something stupid,and sell it. The southern people for all the world sound like northerners tring to sound southern with no practice,How hard can it be?One of my fav.movies My Cousen Vinny,that was well done. Whoever did the cover art for the dvd case had some talent,but thats where it ends.one is the lowest score you can give,or this would be in neg.land. This should be one of those dollar dvds in the checkout line at Walmart,and even then its overpriced.",1283472000,,634,4.7727272727272725
2931007,2,B000V6LTDA,"With curvy, big-bosomed babes, a rubber-suited monster that both improves upon and pays homage to a particular 1954 horror classic, a stereotypical depiction of inbred hillbillies, and a connection to a popular horror-cinema rag, you'd think that CREATURE FROM THE HILLBILLY LAGOON would be a fairly entertaining B-grade horror flick.  But just as with the pet project of the proverbial mad scientist, something went horribly wrong.  And unfortunately, the result is so malformed that it doesn't even fall into the category of the so-bad-it's-good guilty pleasure. It's just soooo bad.

One of the primary problems with CREATURE FROM THE HILLBILLY LAGOON is that the characters are so unsympathetic, unbelievable, and...well...stupid.  The protagonists are supposed to be college students who are assisting a professor in evaluating the extent to which industrial waste has contaminated the waters near a backwoodsy town.  Yet, in spite of their awareness of the level of toxins in the water, these academic geniuses go skinny-dipping in said waters and--you guessed it--cross currents with the film's eponymous monster in not-so-pleasant ways.

Originally released under the moniker SEEPAGE!, this film not only has unlikable protagonists and a hard-to-swallow plotline, the acting is also egregiously unpalatable, the lighting is frequently too harsh and only serves to enhance the flaws in the digital cinematography, and the deplorable depiction of rural hillbillies makes Jethro Bodine and the Clampett clan look like they deserve to rub elbows with brain surgeons and double-naught spies!

The one near-redeeming aspect of CREATURE FROM THE HILLBILLY LAGOON is the eponymous monster itself.  Obviously a visual homage to 1954's CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, this rubber-suit beastie looks like the radio-actively deformed offspring of Universal's classic creature.  But unlike it's '50s-era kin, you can't see the actor inside through the costume's facial orifices, and with its gnarly teeth and slimy, frog-like skin, it's simultaneously repulsive and creep-show cool.

CREATURE FROM THE HILLBILLY LAGOON had potential.  Pretty girls, cynical college boys, toxic industrial waste, a genuinely mad scientist, a cool monster, and hillbillies--all damned good ingredients for fun, campy, B-grade horror. But the amateurish result is a mishmash of bad acting, atrocious characterizations, low-end production value, and a downright silly plot that is essentially unpalatable.  These circumstances just make it too difficult to suspend one's disbelief and sit through the flick from start to finish. In short, genre fans should pass over this one.",1212192000,5,2650,5.681012658227848
8216758,1,B000V6LTDA,"I love the original ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"", and I wanted to see this, a comedy-horror fish monster homage with an outlandish premise that in the right hands could have been clever. Unfortunately ""Creature From the Hillbilly Lagoon"" is an extremely amateurish effort that only served to annoy me. The script, acting, direction, camera work, editing, and especially lighting are abysmal. The film peaks early by virtue of having great opening credits. It stars nobody I'd ever heard of; keep your eyes peeled for cast highlights V. Orion Delwaterman and Sal Lizard.

The film opens with two hillbillies dumping radioactive waste in a swamp, but, bad luck strikes: one of them gets the ""polymorphous genetic material"" all over him, and you know what that means. Wheelchair bound pot-smoking professor Dr. Mary Levon (Mary Ann Schaub) and her idiotic students come down to the lagoon to do some research, and the hijinks ensue. If you have eaten recently stop and take a break for a while before you get to the casual swim in the pond. The acting is amazingly poor, and the effects are generally horrible (the creature suit itself is a bit of redemption from this cinematic purgatory). The story is surprisingly padded and boring, and has terrible dialogue that contributes surprisingly little to the plot's furtherance.

There's a traditional backstory about an evil chemical company illegally dumping in the ecosystem which created a six-foot tall striped bass as a byproduct. Yes, you heard right, the monster is supposed to be a six-foot tall striped bass. Anyway, there are monster fish, a friendly fire incident, and underwater snake bite that leads to a gill-breathing student, hillbillies, and terrible ponderous dialogue like ""phase two of the metamorphosis has begun!"" As the protagonists head down to a convenience store that sells badger milk (I didn't make this up), the body count mercifully increases while we experience some of the worst day and night confusion and awful blue lighting ever seen in a feature film. Ed Wood would be embarrassed.

""Is there a giant fish with a teapot over there?"" That's not a line I expected, but of course there is and he serves the tea with sugar cubes. Obviously the evil corporate scientist is behind all this mutation, and she's going to use the protagonists as breeding stock with her fish (OK, yuck...) because they are ""bleeding heart liberals"". I honestly have no idea what the political angle is here, but the filmmakers just kept chucking diversions and plot contrivances into the film in an apparent hope that something would work. Remember how I said the opening credits were the high point of the film? While that's true, I would be remiss not to mention the breeding program actually leads to a giant fish in frilly lingerie dancing seductively. I'm giving the filmmakers a small nod for originality on that one. Of course the tables are turned and after the seductive fish dance, the meddling kids force the scientist to mate with the striped bass, which should be OK for everyone as she's the best looking member of the cast anyway.

The film was directed by Richard Griffin and was originally referred to as ""Seepage!"" Griffin and others do host a commentary track if you're interested (I watched it but didn't really learn much). The DVD extras also include deleted scenes and some trailers. The concept for this movie was actually promising, but the execution is awful. I found it entirely unfunny and difficult to endure. I love B-movies, but some movies are so bad they're good, but ""Creature From the Hillbilly Lagoon"" is just plain bad.

Not recommended for humans or fish.",1480723200,,3652,4.951060358890701

8216762,5,B000V6LTDA,"I've found that when it comes to B Horror flicks, one simply can't go by the reviews here on Amazon, as there are so many butthurt fanboys trying to sound intelligent when they clearly have A) closed minds and B) no conception of good film making.

I just finished watching this movie on YouTube.  It appears to have been videoed using someone's cell-phone while the makers saved their lunch money for a month to reach the budget.  Nevertheless, it was a fun little romp.  The script is fast moving and actually humorous at times (my favorite line is when they're trying to escape the monster and the truck won't start:  ""Deader than a whore's ass on Sunday!"") while the monster suit is surprisingly well done.  The performances are rather good for a grade C movie like this;  I suspect that the cast members were mainly playing themselves.  I also suspect that the actors were locals as, at times, a couple of them seem to forget that they are on camera and not on a stage before a live audience.  But it's the casting that really makes the movie fun.

Nothing great, but if you like monster flicks and want to have a smile from some people having fun making a cute little flick, I recommend this along with some beer and chips.  More than worthy of 3 and a half stars, I give it a 5 just to counter some of the butthurt fan boys.",1461369600,2,1331,4.391836734693878

It's great if you fast-forward from minute 10 to minute 50. The campy-ness of this movie is only palatable if it's about 40 minutes long. It's kinda like listening to your cousin reminiscing about that time he slept with Madonna. You wanna hear about it, but not THAT much.",1433548800,,363,4.417910447761194

8216767,1,B000V6LTDA,"Creature from the Black Lagoon was a classic. This cheesy, inbred rip-off is not. Ed Wood can rest now, knowing that he is no longer the worst film-maker. Jerry Warren (of ""Manos"" fame) could have written a more coherent story that the makers of this load of runny fecal matter. The production values make The Asylum look like a major studio. Words alone can not describe the buffet of bad this film vomits onto any audience unlucky to come across it. My pallet is refined on bad movies, but this is a total waste of time for anyone but the bravest and most hardened cinefile.",1401321600,2,576,4.495238095238095
