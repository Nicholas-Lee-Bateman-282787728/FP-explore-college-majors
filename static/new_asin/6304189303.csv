7864891,5,6304189303,"IN the first episode on this tape in the first projector scene, when the Davy clip appears, He sings ""Swanee River"" and dances in the street and he gets everyone to sing along with him, WARNING:Please don't try this in real life or YOU MAY BE SENT TO A MENTAL HOSPITAL! Another Part I Like is when Davy sees a Genie, and HE says ""Imagine that, wrong show."" In ""Card-Carrying Red Shoes"" the episode is funny, but I like the ""She Hangs Out"" at the end and he dances and wears the same clothes in like in the ""Daydream Believer"" Video, and this is the only time Mike is in the Episode.",986947200,,582,4.205357142857143
7864892,4,6304189303,"Honestly, I wish the episode titles were on here. Since I own this one, I can tell you it has two episodes, one from the first season ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cool"" and one from the second ""Card-Carrying  Red Shoes"" both deal with foreign spies and feature Peter getting the  girl as opposed to Davy. Good stuff.",962236800,9,317,4.266666666666667
