2705502,5,B000LCGJMK,"OMG!!!! I love this drama. Bi is so sexy in this one OMG. I do have to agree about that kiss after throwing up though EWWWWWWWWWW, but damn you know he can kiss really good. YUMMY LOL!!!!",1249344000,2,187,4.081081081081081
2705503,4,B000LCGJMK,"After watching this drama, all I can say is wow. I usually hate sad dramas but this one just left me kind of speechless at the end. It's everything that everyone else has mentioned - beautiful, gut-wrenching, sad and if you also think about it happy and bittersweet. I hated the ending and it did get emotionally draining to watch all the crying in some scenes but it just makes you want to watch it over and over again in the end. Rain totally does an excellent performance. I loved Full House but here he truly shows that he can act in any scenerio.",1235001600,2,551,4.3076923076923075
2705504,5,B000LCGJMK,"by the same script writer as i'm sorry, i love you, this is the first drama that reached out, grabbed my by the gut, and twisted, then refused to let go. i don't know how else to describe the emotional complexity felt and the way it lingered in my thoughts for months after.
the music is great, and bi/rain was a much better actor in this one than he was in full house.
its not without its flaws, a couple of boring and unnecssary things that could have been edited out, but over all its great.
i have yet to experiance another drama that has moved me in the same way, forcing me to think about life and love in a way i'd not looked at before.
however, a warning, this is not a happy drama.
don't expect disney, think more along the lines of gorey instead. you will be moved to tears, frustration, anger, and heartbreak. if you can handle that, then this is well worth watching.",1228176000,3,878,4.232142857142857
2705505,5,B000LCGJMK,"I must say that this is one of the best Kdramas that I have seen thus far. The acting by the lead characters was superb. The storyline was great. I must also say that Rain is a nice piece of eye candy throughout the series! The leading female is also quite adorable. I highly recommend this series.

I gave this series five stars even though there are two things I take issue with. 1) There are a few gross aspects, such as lots of spitting and close-ups of the male characters crying without wiping their noses. (I'm sorry... I'm a girl with a weak stomach!) 2) The ending.... I realize that these two things are personal issues that do not take away from the substance of the series, so I had to give credit where credit was due.",1217635200,2,731,4.297101449275362
2705506,5,B000LCGJMK,"WARNING! THIS IS A MYSTERY. THE EDITORIAL REVIEW ON THE MAIN PAGE HERE CONTAINS A BIG SPOILER, AS DOES THE BACK OF THE BOX, SO IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON BUYING THIS DRAMA, DON'T READ EITHER OF THESE.

  This is the story of Kang Bok-gu, AKA Dog Bok-gu, (Bi/RAIN), who becomes the bodyguard of a beautiful top Korean movie star in order to be close to her and get revenge on her, as he thinks she is responsible for his brothers suicide attempt and subsequent paralysis.
  In his quest to get the revenge he wants, he must keep her safe from other predators and various accidents. So---not in any particular order, here are the SAVES of Dog Bok-gu:

1. He saves her from being run down by a motorcycle. Note: he almost runs her over with his own motorcycle.
2. He saves her from falling off a very high wall onto the concrete below.
3. He saves her from being raped.
4. He saves her from getting beat up by gangsters.
5. When he finds out her boyfriend is physically abusing her, he puts a stop to it.
6. He saves her from driving really drunk, in a sort of unusual way.
7. He saves her from a rabid fan.
8. He saves her from being run over by another motorcycle.
9. He saves her from freezing to death overnight in the cold. (This is a tricky one for those of you who have seen this).
10. Most of these aren't as ordinary as they sound---they are pretty amazingly done.

No. of definite suicide attempts in this drama: 5
No. of possible others: 2
No. of leading characters in this story who are jealous of other leading characters in this story: 5
No. of leading characters who are alcoholic: 1
No. of leading characters who are bulimic: 1
No. of leading characters who are vegetables: 1
No. of leading characters who are mean and vicious: 1
No. of leading characters who are just plain nuts: 1

The soundtrack is beautiful, the acting is superb, and the story is riveting. Worth every cent and more.

Almost forgot: He becomes her personal vampire for a moment, and drinks her blood.  Bi has now done a 'Goth' video. It's somewhere on You Tube, but I can't remember the title of the clip.

AND---he kisses her right after she throws up, before she rinses her mouth, and it's not one of your typical Kdram closed mouth sanitary kisses either---it's a full on big open-mouth French kiss. Really big---you get the feeling his mouth could be bigger than her face.

Also---if you've seen 'Sangdoo, Let's Go To School', you already  know how much Bi loves to spit, and has obviously spent a lot of time practicing long distance spitting. As the reviewer with the weak stomach said, there is some of that in this film, only it's not really impressive the way it was in 'Sangdoo'.",1209600000,13,2669,4.422448979591837
2705507,5,B000LCGJMK,As a Korean drama series this was very interesting and fun to watch. Although at times it seemed to drag compared to other Korean dramas it is a very good one. I definitly suggest you pick up and watch.,1199664000,2,202,4.205128205128205
2705508,5,B000LCGJMK,"5/5 stars definately. It shows the trueness of the heartbreak in love. The cinematography was also brilliant, especially the snow landscapes. It makes me want to travel the world...Also, the acting was amazing, and even when there were crying scenes, they looked SO real, not those fake ones where they put eye drops on their cheeks, but real crying! I tried so hard not to cry with them, but did not succeed. This drama made me cry basically every episode...This caught my attention because I really enjoy depressing things, and I'm also having love issues. And the whole fact about the ""revenge"" plotline made it's own uniqueness. But the characters are believable and lovable at the same time, and even Bi Rain's character grew on my into my favorite character. His acting is at a loss for words, meaning that he was amazing. I've never truly believed in the emotions of a character as I did with Kang Bok Goo. Not on purpose, but I wasted over 5 boxes of tissues on this. This drama of loss truly shows how not everyone's life is perfect and it's not always a 'happily ever after'. I hope anyone thinking of buying will buy this and truly appreciate this as much as I did, and I'm thankful that I own it.",1198886400,13,1208,4.545871559633028
2705509,5,B000LCGJMK,I disagree with the previous reviewer.  I really got into watching this series - I thought it was excellent.  Jung Ji Hoon's performance really impressed me. The only thing was the ending was a little ambiguous.,1192406400,4,211,4.833333333333333
2705510,4,B000LCGJMK,"The title says it all. The performances were all very good, but Rain's was mesmerizing. It was like a train wreck that you can't look away from. The cinematography was distinctive and just plain cool. If you must have a happy ending then this is not the film for you and even if you like tragedies this film may leave a scar. I gave it 4 stars for Rain's performance and the cinematography. If it wasn't so gut wrenching I would have given it 5.",1190678400,9,445,4.247058823529412
2705511,2,B000LCGJMK,I often got lost with this movie. It had some good moments and the music was good but there was alot of scenes that could have been edited out. What took eight disc could have been done in four. I liked the stars but even their work could not really save it. I am giving the movie a two mainly for the music,1183420800,2,307,3.888888888888889
8161480,5,B000LCGJMK,"Well I love everything this guy does as actor, singer, dancer.  Always more than perfect. It wouldn't be different in this movie. Rain really goes deep in to the character and he is brilliant. Sad story but worth to watch, he  shows he skills as dramatic actor and athlete, I think this was one of the reason he was chose to work in Speed Racer and Ninja Assassin.",1445126400,,364,4.338235294117647
8161481,5,B000LCGJMK,"this was an amazing series, Rain was so good in this drama.  Great to see him in a serious character.  I invested so much time watching this but I was so so so so so disappointed in the ending. In fact really angry that it ended this way.  I am an avid Korean drama watcher and own over a hundred dvd's this is the first time I have ever been so disappointed in an ending.  But Rain did give a stellar performance!",1418860800,,414,4.012195121951219

8161483,5,B000LCGJMK,OMG! One of my favorite dramas! Rain is awesome in this! Such a complex character....and he played him amazingly! Love rain!!!,1379808000,,126,5.0476190476190474
8161484,5,B000LCGJMK,I really liked this item. I'm a big fan of Rain as an actor & a singer. He's the main reason that I bought this series.,1377648000,,119,3.6153846153846154
8161485,4,B000LCGJMK,I thought the price of the dvd set was a little too much. But i'm a fan of Bi-Rain and saw this on Youtube and had to buy.,1367193600,,122,3.392857142857143
8161486,5,B000LCGJMK,"RAIN is so talented that it's almost scarey. He was so believable in this Korean TV Series  that I cried and laughed and cried again.  He's such a powerful actor that I almost forgot that I was watching a show.  The entire cast are excellent.  I could not stop watching from disc 1to4, I was hooked.  I'm so glad that I saw this DVD set.  Worth the money.  Hope I was helpful.",1326067200,,376,4.138888888888889

8161488,5,B000LCGJMK,"5 stars without a doubt, I recently watched this drama and everything about it is amazing. Warning though,you won't find a disney movie happy ending here!! It's way more like real life, there are obstacles, heartbreak, pain, and confusion. I have to say that after watching this I so wish American T.V. had wonderful shows like this, it in all honesty made me want to move to South Korea. Rain and Shin Min Ah's performances were absolutely breathtaking and amazing. At times you will forget that they are acting at all and think this is real. Prior to this I only knew Rain as a singer and thought Ninja Assassin was one of his first acting roles, but I was mistaken and he totally proved me wrong in this drama. The music and scenery accompanying this drama is also gorgeous.
It has the ability to move even the most hardened people to tears.
As long as you can take a not so happy ending then you will love this show.",1279411200,4,920,4.41764705882353
8161489,3,B000LCGJMK,"This is a really good drama with excellent acting and filming for it's year. It's not my usual pick in dramas because I prefer to have a half comedic side to the show. But if you like something that is all drama then go for it. And the subbing is great, no complants in that area",1270512000,,279,4.0
