This tool wasn't around when we were growing up, so we had a hard time learning the importance of math and how it relates to money that we all use every day.  I'm excited for our kids.  This is a great life lesson tool.  The whole family will watch and learn from this over and over.",1301356800,7,351,4.088235294117647

8307107,4,B001GTS9HK,"I grew up with the School House Rock jingles on Saturday mornings, in between cartoons.  Now I'm buying them for my grandchildren.  The catchy tunes really do stick in the brain and teach my 5, 7 & 9 year olds valuable lessons.  This is the 4th cassette I've purchased of this collection.  I'll be buying more!  A bit pricey, but worth it.",1456963200,,339,4.403225806451613

8307111,3,B001GTS9HK,"The songs for the Money version of the School House Rock aren't nearly as catchy and fun to follow, in my opinion, as the other topics. I was hoping for at least one basic explanations of money, the monetary breakdown... coins, paper money, adding, to buy, saving. There's one on saving and borrowing, but most of the topics I think target maybe middle schoolers? Because the songs aren't so catchy, they wouldn't stick for later reference... like my 6-year-old really loves Interjections because its presentation was hilarious... wouldn't be so easy to retain, otherwise. Unfortunately, the Money songs don't really have that effectiveness. BUT, will be good to reference again later when he's ready. Love the whole series in general.",1428451200,5,735,5.133333333333334
