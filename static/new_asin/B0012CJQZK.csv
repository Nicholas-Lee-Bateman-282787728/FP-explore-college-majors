All the exciting skiing is towards the end of the film, and it's not packed with excitement.  It's more about connecting with the lifestyle we choose, and remembering just how close to the edge of life we can find ourselves.",1208649600,3,396,4.472222222222222

It is the story of the first through to present day back country skiing, with some amazing footage. It starts with the pioneers of this sport telling of there experiences being the very first to try skiing in places no one had ever attempted to ski before, and evolved through the 80's and 90's to now. Trust me you don't even need to be a skier to enjoy this film. Brilliant.",1207094400,4,606,4.232758620689655

dir. Mark Obenhaus,  2007

Risk and Joy

One of the subjects of Mark Obenhaus's fascinating documentary on extreme ski mountaineering speaks of the pure and simple joy he experiences when tackling a difficult run, and then tells us the joy wouldn't be so great without the risk inherent in the challenge.  I think this is one of the younger skiers, perhaps Shane McConkey. [I saw this in theater a couple of months ago, so details may be a bit vague.]  But on the other hand, one of the older and wiser heads, I believe one of those who opened up Chamonix, tells us that though the risk may look extreme, the challenge is in developing skill and technique so that the apparent risk is reduced to manageable and sane levels.  Of course, what is manageable and sane to some may be crazy foolhardiness to the rest of us, but after all we take risks every day and familiarity dulls the realization that a careless traffic merge, or pushing the speed to make that sales meeting, could result in a far more gruesome death than any in the mountains.

I was on the fringe, or perhaps the fringe of the fringe, of serious outdoors types in the 80's (about when the skiing documented here began to pick up pace), not so much the extreme downhill skiers who went up only to come down, but hard climbers and ski mountaineers who considered it a form of transportation to get into snowbound areas they might hike and climb the rest of the year.  These people were very like the earlier adventurers documented here, always conscious of the risk and trying to minimize it, though in the end accepting it for the joy brought by a challenge successfully met or simply being where few others would ever be.

I should emphasize that this is NOT a thrill-a-minute ""ski movie"".  Anyone expecting constant headbanging adrenaline will likely be disappointed.  Though there are sufficient moments of daredeviltry for most tastes (especially in the later parts of the film -- it is nicely paced and progressive), there are also scenes of skiers inching sidewise down steep slopes, or cutting short switchbacks with cautious turns, precision craftsmanship rather than freeform bravado.  What this film is, is a historical documentary exploring the sport's development and the psychology of extreme skiers, from the pioneers to modern day adrenaline junkies, using a combination of archive footage (of varying technical quality), interviews, and high quality original footage of the feats of the current skiers and the breathtaking landscape they take place in.  Fascinating and visually beautiful, with sufficient excitement for most of us.",1206835200,18,2620,4.900452488687783
3086284,5,B0012CJQZK,"At first, it appeared that this would be a movie that only appeals to skiers. In fact, this is a fascinating and thrilling ride. You will see places on earth you did not know existed. You will see these guys riding helicopters to the top of mountains where there is barely enough room to stand, and then, skiing downhill at blazing speed. As you might expect, as the movie passes from continent to continent, we see some of the guys we had followed in the beginning actually die. This is a thrilling movie and is not to be missed.",1202688000,17,530,4.363636363636363

My husband and I have skied Chamonix, and  this movie also conveys with clear perceptions, the amazing Mont Blanc range of France and of Chamonix.  I can't recommend this movie enough.  For those who even just would like a taste of what it's like being with, skiing, and receiving the mountains and their potent energetic contributions to us on the planet, this is the movie for you.  I've been told by people who I've gifted this movie to, that it changed their lives in wonderful ways.

I like the film a lot, the stories are great but I have to say I was expecting more footage of skiing and climbing etc.  The ""interview"" footage seems a bit long when maybe just audio could have been laid over some action footage.  For me to enjoy owning a movie, it has to be watchable repeatedly.  I didn't pay much for this disc so that does make it more palatable if I don't watch it many more times.  Still, it's a good flick, has some great scenes and footage of seriously steep skiing and at first viewing it was captivating.

I'm not sure that's how I want to die but it's way more romantic than a car accident.

3086313,3,B0012CJQZK,"I grew up watching and idolizing Warren Miller and the guys lucky enough to make his films. When I read the synapses of this film, that it was ""in the mold of Warren Miller,"" I was foolishly optimistic. It lacks the dry humor and wit that was so prevalent in all of Warren's movies (at least until he bowed away and handed the keys to his kids anyhow).
This film does have some fantastic scenery, and some great skiing. If I hadn't been expecting what the label said, I may not have been so harsh on it, but I most likely also wouldn't have spent a dime on it.",1362787200,,560,4.146788990825688

3086316,5,B0012CJQZK,"No brainier giving this documentary 5stars....I would give it 6 if it was allowed.  The fantastic information/interviews in this film were only topped by it's incredible action scenes.

No need to care even the least about skiing, or extreme skiing specifically in this case.  Steep is about living life at the very edge, and chasing one's dream regardless of the risks, or dangers associated with doing so.  This is also truly an inspirational documentary.

Just like Riding Giants told the story and history behind the sport of big wave surfing, Steep does the same thing with extreme big mountain skiing.  Do yourself a favor and watch both of those documentaries.

This film is the exact reason why documentaries are easily my favorite genre of films, and when done right they deliver both an excellent learning experience, as well as a overall entertaining one.",1356393600,,866,5.013986013986014
3086317,5,B0012CJQZK,"This is a necessary piece for your ski movie collection.  Mind I am reviewing this film 5 years after it was released too.  This is not exactly a ski movie, but more a documentary of extreme big mountain skiing.  Great interviews, great 'historic' footage.  This film perfect depicts the reason we all flock to the mountains and ski.  Buy it!!",1353628800,,343,4.65
3086318,5,B0012CJQZK,"For those who want spectacular photography of gorgeous but viciously hazardous and perilous places, this is the documentary. Many people may not even know these places exist. If you want the history and development of extreme skiing, interviews with the incredibly skilled skiers and climbers, and their philosophy of it all, this fascinating program offers plenty of that. Cautious, extremely dangerous, thrilling rides are filmed very well. Some of the sportsmen explicitly state that living very close to death makes them appreciate life more. Others state that while the ride may be fatal, training and preparation for it is the key to success. In some cases, a helicopter drops them off at the top of a mountain where there is hardly enough room to stand, and they ski downhill through the breathtaking scenery, taking as many `survival turns' as needed, jumping many hundred feet, and make it down victoriously. Of course, the program makes it clear that not all of them make it alive. For the mesmerized audience, the whole feat is nothing less than phenomenal.",1343001600,3,1068,5.073863636363637
3086319,5,B0012CJQZK,"I don't know if it was the Blu-Ray that made this film so fantastic or the extreme skiing. I am not a skier but I can appreciate the skill and athleticism of the sport - these people make it look easy. The scenery is so outstanding as to be breathtaking, as if I was there! One can only appreciate the human endeavor to face incredible challenges like this kind of skiing - I was mesmerized from the beginning.",1334793600,,410,4.269230769230769

3086321,1,B0012CJQZK,"I was so excited when I got this video for my son and I to watch. I was soon bored out of my mind and I could tell he had the same reaction. I wanted some great footage and music to match. I found that in the editing phase, they cut all of the footage short, not providing the fullness of the run. And while I like the idea of mixing in commentary, those sections seemed to dominate the essence of the film, and those conversations most often fell way short. I also bought Step Into Liquid, a surfing video. Now there was an example of a great, entertaining watch. The angles of the photography, timing, dialogue, everything. I have always heard great things of Warren Miller and think I saw some of his stuff years ago. But I am dismayed to see the ratings for this film so high. I'm not sure if it is just a hail to the chief kind of thing or what. I am so desirous of a good ski watch however, I may try another one. I'd love one filled with great footage of great skiing, on a regular mountains accessible to everyday people, but shot with the best skiers in the world.",1302912000,,1073,4.138755980861244
3086322,3,B0012CJQZK,"I bought this blu-ray based on the reviews on this site. It's not a bad movie, but it's basically a documentary. If you're into the history of ""extreme"" skiing this is a perfect fit for you. But if you're into watching some awesome tricks and some cool music--you won't find it here. The beginning of this is pretty slow but it picks up towards the end once they show the more modern styles of helicopter drop off skiing. Overall it wasn't bad, but if you aren't an avid skier and just want something fun to watch, pick up a Warren Miller flick instead.",1296518400,,553,4.378640776699029
3086323,5,B0012CJQZK,"This is a documentary not a 45 min ""show me all the best the ski stars have to offer"" from last year.  This film interviews a few of the truly great skiers that influenced extreme skiing around the world from it's inception to now.  This film beautifully explains the balance between risk and reward. It states that risk is an inherent part of life and that each of us can find joy in our own level of risk, but do not hide from the so called ""dangerous"" things in life just to stay ""safe"".  Getting off the couch and into elements of nature, where you actually could die, is where the paradox of truly living begins and gratitude for this life is found.",1274659200,,654,4.300813008130081
3086324,5,B0012CJQZK,"A must have for any skiing or outdoor enthusiast. This isn't your typical warren miller or matchstick ski movie (they're great as well), its more of a documentary style film with interviews from skiing legends such as Doug Coombs, Shane McConkey, Glen Plake, etc... What I loved about this movie was how they explored the emotions that drive these athletes to seek such extreme skiing and take such enormous risks. The film shows the glamorous side of extreme skiing, but it also hits home on the risk side of the sport and how nearly all those interviewed had lost a good friend in the mountains. Some of those interviewed eventually lose their lives as well. I can't recommend this film highly enough...for those of you wondering why you love to ski, this could be the answer you've been looking for.",1266796800,,802,4.735714285714286

What I liked most about Steep is that it's not an action/huck packed film. It's essentially a documentary on Doug Coombs and Bill Briggs and, not to steal Glen Plake's line, it's a bunch of good skiers out having a good time and doing what they love.  I definitely recommend it.",1234828800,,473,4.233333333333333
3086332,5,B0012CJQZK,"This doesn't fit the Warren Miller ski film model, as much as I loved going out to see those with friends from my ski club, and it DEFINITELY is not the Teton Gravity / ski porn  etc. ""we got attitude"" genre.

This is about feeling the ride down the most gorgeous snow-covered scenery you can think of. It's not attitude, it's longing, it's a connection, it's the kind of skiing we all crave to do, whether we'll ever dare to - or even survive it - or not. I loved ""Steep"" and just had to watch it a 2nd time. That's rare for any movie, for me - sports, drama, action whatever. I just had to, because unlike the Miller or ""attidude"" movies (which can't seem to get away from sliding down stair railings), this is a movie I could feel.

Steep is best enjoyed at home with close friends, just sipping some beer or wine, on a big screen with good audio. it gets down the soul, what really moves us about the sport, no matter we can't do most of the things on screen.

This movie, although it is a documentary style, is ""it speaks to me"" in style - about what makes the sport so special. It has a feeling like Doug Combs and the rest are talking to you, not at you. The photography (that they used that cable-camera thing used to cover football games from above the field lends realism not found in any other ski movie to many shots), direction and production are excellent. The soft & gentle classical music themes are so fitting for the soft powder runs that dominate the movie.

It isn't just about the history of extreme skiing, it's about living the dream. Watching this movie you'll feel like you're there, living it with them.

I highly recommend it.",1232755200,4,1653,4.333333333333333
3086333,5,B0012CJQZK,"This film is what Enless Summer is to surfing, what Dogtown and Z-Boys is to skateboarding.  The look back at the history of steep skiing is outstanding, with interviews and film footage of some of the greatest moments out of Jackson (Grand Teton) and Chamonix.  A large chunk of the film is centered around the euro's and what Chamonix has meant to the world of steep skiing - which is completely appropriate; and it puts into perspecttive our North American concern for matching outfits versus the Cham passion for exploring and skiing.  Intriguing interviewing and narrative from big mountain skiiers is what makes the film - haven't we all wondered, ""why would he ski that?"" or, ""Is he nuts?""  The interviews let you creep into that dark spot in their heads.  An excellent touch is commentary by Steve Casimiro.  He is in my opinion the best, and most soul-ful print editor to wander through the ski industry.  As former editor of Powder during the '80's and '90's, he was there for the emergence of todays ""extreme.""  He and his writers wrote extensively about Plake, Hatrup, etc., during the Stump era of film making.  It's a great touch having his face and commentary on screen.  By the end of the film what rings through is the deep emotional connection the featured athletes have for their sport.  It's not a hobby for them, but truly a lifestyle that somehow has taken control of them.  None of them seemed to be into skiing for the glory or attention.  Rather, I was convinced that the skiers are convined that their soul is truly part of the mountains.",1232496000,,1564,4.684981684981685

Risk and Joy

One of the subjects of Mark Obenhaus's fascinating documentary on extreme ski mountaineering speaks of the pure and simple joy he experiences when tackling a difficult run, and then tells us the joy wouldn't be so great without the risk inherent in the challenge.  I think this is one of the younger skiers, perhaps Shane McConkey. [I saw this in theater a couple of months ago, so details may be a bit vague.]  But on the other hand, one of the older and wiser heads, I believe one of those who opened up Chamonix, tells us that though the risk may look extreme, the challenge is in developing skill and technique so that the apparent risk is reduced to manageable and sane levels.  Of course, what is manageable and sane to some may be crazy foolhardiness to the rest of us, but after all we take risks every day and familiarity dulls the realization that a careless traffic merge, or pushing the speed to make that sales meeting, could result in a far more gruesome death than any in the mountains.

I was on the fringe, or perhaps the fringe of the fringe, of serious outdoors types in the 80's (about when the skiing documented here began to pick up pace), not so much the extreme downhill skiers who went up only to come down, but hard climbers and ski mountaineers who considered it a form of transportation to get into snowbound areas they might hike and climb the rest of the year.  These people were very like the earlier adventurers documented here, always conscious of the risk and trying to minimize it, though in the end accepting it for the joy brought by a challenge successfully met or simply being where few others would ever be.

I should emphasize that this is NOT a thrill-a-minute ""ski movie"".  Anyone expecting constant headbanging adrenaline will likely be disappointed.  Though there are sufficient moments of daredeviltry for most tastes (especially in the later parts of the film -- it is nicely paced and progressive), there are also scenes of skiers inching sidewise down steep slopes, or cutting short switchbacks with cautious turns, precision craftsmanship rather than freeform bravado.  What this film is, is a historical documentary exploring the sport's development and the psychology of extreme skiers, from the pioneers to modern day adrenaline junkies, using a combination of archive footage (of varying technical quality), interviews, and high quality original footage of the feats of the current skiers and the breathtaking landscape they take place in.  Fascinating and visually beautiful, with sufficient excitement for most of us.",1206835200,18,2620,4.900452488687783
3320781,5,B0012CJQZK,"At first, it appeared that this would be a movie that only appeals to skiers. In fact, this is a fascinating and thrilling ride. You will see places on earth you did not know existed. You will see these guys riding helicopters to the top of mountains where there is barely enough room to stand, and then, skiing downhill at blazing speed. As you might expect, as the movie passes from continent to continent, we see some of the guys we had followed in the beginning actually die.

No need to care even the least about skiing, or extreme skiing specifically in this case.  Steep is about living life at the very edge, and chasing one's dream regardless of the risks, or dangers associated with doing so.  This is also truly an inspirational documentary.

Just like Riding Giants told the story and history behind the sport of big wave surfing, Steep does the same thing with extreme big mountain skiing.  Do yourself a favor and watch both of those documentaries.

Cautious, extremely dangerous, thrilling rides are filmed very well. Some of the sportsmen explicitly state that living very close to death makes them appreciate life more. Others state that while the ride may be fatal, training and preparation for it is the key to success. In some cases, a helicopter drops them off at the top of a mountain where there is hardly enough room to stand, and they ski downhill through the breathtaking scenery, taking as many `survival turns' as needed, jumping many hundred feet, and make it down victoriously.

And while I like the idea of mixing in commentary, those sections seemed to dominate the essence of the film, and those conversations most often fell way short. I also bought Step Into Liquid, a surfing video. Now there was an example of a great, entertaining watch. The angles of the photography, timing, dialogue, everything. I have always heard great things of Warren Miller and think I saw some of his stuff years ago. But I am dismayed to see the ratings for this film so high.

It states that risk is an inherent part of life and that each of us can find joy in our own level of risk, but do not hide from the so called ""dangerous"" things in life just to stay ""safe"".

The film shows the glamorous side of extreme skiing, but it also hits home on the risk side of the sport and how nearly all those interviewed had lost a good friend in the mountains.

I loved ""Steep"" and just had to watch it a 2nd time. That's rare for any movie, for me - sports, drama, action whatever. I just had to, because unlike the Miller or ""attidude"" movies (which can't seem to get away from sliding down stair railings), this is a movie I could feel.

Steep is best enjoyed at home with close friends, just sipping some beer or wine, on a big screen with good audio. it gets down the soul, what really moves us about the sport, no matter we can't do most of the things on screen.

This movie, although it is a documentary style, is ""it speaks to me"" in style - about what makes the sport so special. It has a feeling like Doug Combs and the rest are talking to you, not at you. The photography (that they used that cable-camera thing used to cover football games from above the field lends realism not found in any other ski movie to many shots), direction and production are excellent. The soft & gentle classical music themes are so fitting for the soft powder runs that dominate the movie.

It isn't just about the history of extreme skiing, it's about living the dream. Watching this movie you'll feel like you're there, living it with them.

I highly recommend it.",1232755200,4,1653,4.333333333333333
3320830,5,B0012CJQZK,"This film is what Enless Summer is to surfing, what Dogtown and Z-Boys is to skateboarding.  The look back at the history of steep skiing is outstanding, with interviews and film footage of some of the greatest moments out of Jackson (Grand Teton) and Chamonix.  A large chunk of the film is centered around the euro's and what Chamonix has meant to the world of steep skiing - which is completely appropriate; and it puts into perspecttive our North American concern for matching outfits versus the Cham passion for exploring and skiing.  Intriguing interviewing and narrative from big mountain skiiers is what makes the film - haven't we all wondered, ""why would he ski that?"" or, ""Is he nuts?""  The interviews let you creep into that dark spot in their heads.  An excellent touch is commentary by Steve Casimiro.  He is in my opinion the best, and most soul-ful print editor to wander through the ski industry.  As former editor of Powder during the '80's and '90's, he was there for the emergence of todays ""extreme.""  He and his writers wrote extensively about Plake, Hatrup, etc., during the Stump era of film making.  It's a great touch having his face and commentary on screen.  By the end of the film what rings through is the deep emotional connection the featured athletes have for their sport.  It's not a hobby for them, but truly a lifestyle that somehow has taken control of them.  None of them seemed to be into skiing for the glory or attention.  Rather, I was convinced that the skiers are convined that their soul is truly part of the mountains.",1232496000,,1564,4.684981684981685

3320832,3,B0012CJQZK,"more of a documentry than anything. Good ideas, however much of the footage was purchased from other ski movies, hence there was a disjointed feeling often seen between segments. The doug coombs segment however was a 5 of 5. That segment made it worth owning.",1226793600,2,259,4.777777777777778

Steep tells the story of extreme skiing from the fifties through to the current day. It follows the lives of some of the skiing worlds most groundbreaking figures, and in some cases, tells the story of their deaths.
Jaw dropping cinematography. Awe inspiring scenery. Fluid and captivating storytelling.
Need I saw more? This movie belongs on every skiers shelf, or should I say in every skiers DVD player. I've watched it at least a half a dozen times in the two weeks I've owned it.
You should too.",1212969600,,601,4.574074074074074
3320838,2,B0012CJQZK,"How long can you watch folks make some jumps and then others drone through  excessive dialogue? After, it isn't the skiiers minds on display, its their physical prowess and courage no doubt but some of the conversations are really terribly sophomoric and perfect for passing out on the couch, funny that should happen watching a ski movie. The worst part is you see some heavy powder skis, you see the mountain tearing up and coming down right behind the skiier and the film cuts away to some other guy doing overdone backflips somewhere. The elegance and art of skiing is lost and one has this feeling of never really seeing a full run. Youtube posts are much better. A bit of a waste of money and time. Well, the producers made some revenue since I bought a few of these. Verdict: don't bother, go to youtube, search for extreme skiing, ski jumps  etc. much better content and fully loaded clips",1212364800,2,897,4.6

I knew there would be some talk and interviews. I thought I could weed through the talk on a monitor then project 10 minutes of action on the projection. It's more like 10 min of talk then 30 seconds of skiing, then back to the talk. If you want to view action buy something else. There's just something about talk that doesn't seem to get me too excited.",1484697600,2,514,4.309278350515464

Instead of having a bunch of different clips of different skiers flying down big mountains, usually strung together by some middling backstory and narration, this movie gets you involved and makes you think about what drives the skiers you see in these films.  It also includes some amazing shots of skiing, but it's the story that this movie tells that brings me back to watch it again and again.",1482796800,,477,4.6
