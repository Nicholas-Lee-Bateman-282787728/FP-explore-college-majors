303870,5,6301008618,"This film is unbelieveably great both stylistically and in its story of how ""The Pepsi Generation"" of the late-1960s put reckless impetuousness at a premium- which can lead to throwing away one's marriage one instant, and then changing your mind about it the next. This is Richard Lester's greatest flick. ""Hard Day's Night"" was great, of course, but here you get a jump-cut style that includes both flashbacks and premonitions- it seems a very hip style and is suited to the subject matter of the film. And the shots are brilliantly composed- very dramatic visuals (really, it is like an innovative language of film visuals, in that a single conversation or interaction between two characters can be illustrated with changing visual motifs. The slideshow of Archie's ex-marriage during conversation about his current life is especially brilliant).Also, you get about a minute and a half of the Dead playing ""Viola Lee Blues"", in their psychedelic heyday- complete multi-media experience. And, in one scene Garcia and Weir appear amongst what are supposed to be the ""neighbors"", who are rubbernecking a denizen of their turf being carted off on a gurney. The neighborhood is Telegraph Hill, San Fran.- thought to myself: ""why aren't these guys in the Haight-Ashbury?""- because they wanted to be in the movie! Also, it has George C. Scott giving his usual great performance. And Julie Christie is believeably kooky. Buy this one, man- one of the greatest all-time of celluloid creations. For real.",1029801600,3,1496,5.135245901639344
303871,5,6301008618,"This is a movie that works extremely well on video.
The action moves back & forth...endless flashbacks etc...the ability to re-watch & rewind is very important for  full enjoyment.
Christie is superb. She puts in an accomplished & mature performance. George C.Scott is at his under-stated best.
Wonderful, moody soundtrack by John Barry, (who wrote all the James Bond Themes of the '60's).Superb photography by Nic Roeg, (who went on to direct Christie in, 'Don't Look Now').
Very '60's. Very stylish. Very under-rated.",979948800,2,519,5.253012048192771
303872,5,6301008618,"This move changed my life, and almost single-handedly  propelled me into a career in film.  If nothing else, it validates Richard Lester as an artist ahead of his time, honors George C. Scott as one of the most gifted actors  of his day, and provides Julie Christie with the greatest showcase for her  talents.  The non-linear storytelling and the jump-cut editing is  brilliant.  The film's heart and lustful, confused tension defies the  beautifully cold cinematography.  The film pierces through the pot-smoke  haze of the late-60's and blesses us with something wonderful.  Thank you  Mr. Lester for making this film.  One of my all-tome favorites.",956016000,7,652,5.153846153846154
303873,5,6301008618,"There's an oft-repeated list of breakthrough films from the 1960's that contains the great:  Dr. Strangelove, Point Blank, Bonnie & Clyde, Blow Up; the good:  The Graduate, Midnight Cowboy; and the unwatchable:  Easy  Rider.  But never Petulia!  Why?  Richard Lester's dazzling arsenal of  jump-cuts, flash-forwards and flash-backs--used to comic effect in A Hard  Day's Night and The Knack--are harnassed to a scathing and  ahead-of-its-time analysis of various San Franciscans during the Summer of  Love.  I've seen the film at various times over 30 years and I still catch  throwaway visuals and verbal asides that add resonance to the story.  The  performances are pitch perfect--with Julie Christie proving that no star  since Audrey Hepburn combined beauty, talent and mystery in quite the same  way.  The cameos capture the city during that pivotal summer:  Janis Joplin  with Big Brother and the Grateful Dead in performance; Jerry Garcia and Bob  Weir taunting Petulia as she's carried into an ambulance; Howared  Hesseman--later of TV's WKRP, giving George C. Scott the stoned treatment  as he wanders around chilling looking, faceless Daly City.  This doesn't  celebrate the dawning of the Age of Aquarius--it dissects it, damns it,  and, oddly enough, ends up finding some heart beneath the cool.  It's a  '60s classic that's aged as beautifully as, say, Bonnie & Clyde, which  is the fate of very few ""breakthrough"" films.",949881600,43,1435,5.28125
303874,4,6301008618,"Petulia gives a glimpse of San Francisco in the 60's that has almost never been captured on film.  Lester gives a number of delicious touches--Janis Joplin performing at the Fairmount for a formal charity ball, George C  Scott at the wheel of a Camero, Scot and York out for a night at the  Alphaville Hilton--underappreciated film of the decade, which, like Harold  and Maude, makes use of San Francisco as a character in the film.",934070400,,432,4.72

303904,2,6301008618,"This mediorce film is considered ""one of the decades top films"" by esteemed reviewer Leonard Maltin.  Every once in awhile even the best reviewers get it wrong.  Julie Christie plays a carefree ""Kooky"" type in her pursuit of medical doctor George C. Scott.  Scott is a brilliant actor but is noticably wooden in this effort.  Richard Chamberland is a boring pretty boy type married to kooky Christie.
The editing is choppy - typical of other Richard Lester films.  If you watch closely you see a bit of Janis Joplin and Jerry Garcia, giving it that authentic San Francisco 60's rock feel to Lester's credit.  Overall though, an amazingly pretentious film.  There is really nothing outstanding here.",1385769600,6,698,4.9655172413793105

whirlpool of an affair with a young married women while at the same time going through a divorce with his own wife while also dealing with a middle age crisis. What a combation!

303906,4,6301008618,"If you like George C. Scott and Julie Christie you will enjoy this movie.  I liked this movie because it was certainly a twist on your usual stalker type flick. Of course, having two great actors did not do any harm either. Ms. Christie plays a married woman who in the beginning is no more than a complication in the good Doctor's (Scott) life.  At first he regards Petulia (Christie) as a nuisance,however that doesn't sway Petulia's efforts to make the doctor fall for her. Petulia wins him over la ti da some romantic moments, touching togetherness with Doc's family (divorcee).  The ending was unrealistic as it could be, I don't want to ruin that so lets just say this was made in 1967 the value system was a little different then and it is improbable that such an ending would even make it to print today.",1287878400,,812,4.510204081632653
303907,5,6301008618,"Love this movie.  It is such a vintage 1960 film.  Julie Christie, as usual, is superb; What can George Scott do wrong, nothing. Richard
Chamberlain as a villan is wonderfully different.  For baby boomers, it is a step back in time.  Wonderful.",1284768000,,244,4.738095238095238
303908,4,6301008618,"Petulia opens with a shot of a middle-aged woman in a wheelchair, then
cuts to a sixties' rock club featuring a very young-looking Janis
Joplin. The sixties counterculture definitely torpedoed middle-aged
women. Their husbands, like Archie, the middle-aged doctor played by
George G. Scott, have the luxury of deciding they're ""tired"" of being
married and jumping into affairs with younger women. This is a cause of
continuing sadness to his ex-wife Polo, wonderfully played by Shirley
Knight. Archie becomes involved with Petulia (Julie Christie), a
clichd ""kooky"" young woman of a type that often appeared in films of
this period. Petulia is married to an abusive, wealthy husband, David,
played with suitable evil by Richard Chamerlain. Christie is such a
good actress that she gives some dimension to the role, although she's
far outshone by Knight as Polo, the wounded wife. In its technique and
attitude it really is a European or British film shot in San Francisco
with American actors. There are interesting cultural references to the
sixties, that may have seemed daring at the time, but now seem more
innocent than anything else. The film is really about Archie and men of
his generation and their bewilderment at the changing cultural mores
represented by Petulia. On one hand they're delighted to feel that they
can have sex with no responsibilities, but Petulia, for all her charm
brings nothing but chaos into Archie's life. Was it really worth for
him to be involved with her? And he ends up stuck with a high
maintenance greenhouse in his apartment.",1281225600,,1565,5.046332046332046
303909,5,6301008618,"It took me awhile to see this film.  Most of the time it was out of print and unavailable.  It isn't a film they show on Sunday afternoons when people are spending time at home.  It goes deeper and more complicated than most people are able to fathom, especially when watching it in a casual manner on TV.  Luckily, I found a old copy of a paperback I probably got at a garage sale years ago in my basement.  The book is wonderful and I highly recommend it.  The book also helps understand the way the movie is put together as they are essentially the same.  A doctor who leaves his wife and children with no particular goal or reason becomes involved with a younger married woman who portrays herself as a carefree kook.  She presents herself as a carefree version of a fling but immediately it becomes clear that casual is the furthest thing from her mind.  She is a woman trying to free herself from a marriage for money which has become a nightmare.  Her husband is wife beater of the most violent kind and his family participates in the constant cover up.  She is a pawn in a game that could get herself killed.  Petulia seems to believe that the doctor could save her from the abusive relationship along with a young boy from Mexico her husband essentially kidnapped and abused also.  A very sad touching film of two good people stuck in very sad situations.  One of seemingly benign career dedication and social conventions.  The other of tighter social conventions and a threat to her life.  The story is beautifully told but does demand attention.  It is a film that has yet to be surpassed in its depiction of the 1960s.",1227225600,2,1630,4.4711864406779664
303910,2,6301008618,"Julie Christie parades her proletariat pout through 2 hours of psychedelic pretensions, all of which are seemingly supposed to suggest great profundity and hidden meaning--but don't be fooled--this is an empty parcel wrapped in glittering paper, with a core as resoundingly vacuous as the society it attempts to depict.

The story, (such as it is) concerns a chic young woman (Miss Christie as ""Petulia"") who picks up children and middle aged men with casual indifference to convention, because she's ""kooky"" (recall that our anti-heroine here inherits this voguish characteristic from her cinematic sisters in ""Georgy Girl,"" ""Darling"" and anything with Sandy Duncan). The reason for this, to which the story eventually arrives, but which it anticipates with frequent visual flashbacks, lies in an unhappy marriage with wealthy pretty boy Richard Chamberlin.

In this instance, Petulia's latest adult male conquest is a recently divorced physician, (George C. Scott) with whom she commits adultery, between kooky capers (installing a greenhouse in a residential urban apartment, shopping out the store in an all night grocery etc.) and pronouncements such as ""I think I've just found the cure for cancer"".

Amid the kookiness, and in order to assure us that this is all to be taken in deadly earnest, the story includes an incident in which Petulia is hospitalized after sustaining multiple lacerations in Mr. Scott's apartment. This sequence replete with ambulance runs, and much blood is designed to arouse sympathy for any in the audience who haven't yet warmed to our anti-heroine, who also turns out to be expecting a baby.

Mr. Scott wears an expression throughout the film suggesting the worst case of indigestion in history, (and by the way it's the only expression he wears) and one wonders if his dissatisfaction is with the script or the character.

In any case, he's unsympathetic, not the least of which is because his ex-wife is portrayed by the exquisitely lovely Shirley Knight of the golden blonde hair and guileless cornflower blue eyes. Her performance, so dead on target, saves the film, in at least those sequences in which she appears.

Along the way, every visual clich in the book is thrown in at some point including protesting hippies, daisy covered vans, strobe lit discotheques, and rock bands. The faddish choppy editing through which these scenes appear fleetingly is about as subtle as a sledge hammer.

If the point of this cinematic charade is that modern society is filled with poseurs, then ""Darling"" from three years earlier made the same point much better. In this case, ""Petulia"" is the poseur par excellence.",1221091200,9,2647,5.170560747663552
303911,2,6301008618,"I found this movie to be very odd, and VERY hard to follow. While I agree Julie Christie is indeed beautiful, it is not enough to ""save"" this film which I found to be quite boring. I think the people in it spend a bit to much time trying to be ""cool"". The film takes itself too seriously and scatter-brained character of Ms. Christie doesn't help. I get the feeling that the director thought with beauty of Julie Christie who needs a storyline. Sorry, but wrong. The only ""plus"" for me were the 60's clothes and scenes of my hometown area of San Francisco. Other than that, I think I'll give this film the snooze of the month award.",1217721600,7,632,4.319327731092437

303915,5,6301008618,"Warner Bros never cease to thrill me much of the time with classic film releases to DVD. I hope they continue unveiling classics like this from their endless vaults. Warner Bros does another great job using cover art work from the original film release artwork used, and it looks great! I also love it when you get to see in classic films like Petulia the original Warner Bros film logos that opened the film when they were first released... sometimes this is where Warner Bros fails to bring back the magic when they use their newer fresher logos on films that never were released with these logos to begin with. Still Petulia is a classic and many should take a chance and see this classic for what it is.

303916,5,6301008618,"Set in San Francisco at the height of the Summer of Love, Lester's stylish melodrama pays homage to the swinging sixties in more ways than one: Through jarring jump cuts, flashbacks and ""flash forwards,"" and glimpses of the Grateful Dead performing for a crowd of gyrating hipsters, the director evokes the psychedelic ethos of the era as a way in to the turbulent lives of Archie and Petulia, each of whom is suffering a private torment: she is a victim of abuse, while he just wants to ""feel something."" Scott and Christie are exemplary in their roles, while Chamberlain gets to look pretty, sulk, and act like a cad. Lensed by Nicholas Roeg, ""Petulia"" is a trippy tale of love and confusion that explores the humid underside of flower power.",1182988800,2,744,4.730769230769231
303917,5,6301008618,"Petulia (1968) is a personal favorite of mine and Julie Christie is my all-time favorite actress. I remember seeing this movie on the late movie as a teenager and being awed by the acting. the major photography and the editing.
I beleive Richard Lester directed this film in a chaotic, revelatory way to express the ""reality"" of what was going down around these characters and in their personal lives as well. Kind of like filming a tragedy of errors in the middle of a psychedelic trip.
Richard Chamberlain in the performance of his career. Joseph Cotten is welcome in any film that I view. Shirley Knight gives an incredible performance as one who has no control over their marriage at all anymore, but is clinging to the fantasy that she is in complete control. Kudos to all the supporting cast.
And George C. Scott, of course, whether he knows what he's doing or not, he's still giving a brillant performance, a healer who forgets his own importance in this life. His kids, his wife, his friends don't understand his situation, only Petulia.
Julie Christie as Petulia: she witnesses George C. Scott's character operate on a Mexican kid with whom she is personally involved. When she meets him at a benefit, she already knows who he is, and she wants to force herself into his life and his situation, even giving him the illusion of having a one-night stand. In doing so, she becomes his troubled muse, and he soon learns some shocking truths about her life.
These situations only begin to explain that this movie has several different levels to operate on, and requires multiple viewings to understand. And that is just fine, because the viewer falls in love with the characters and the story that much more after successive viewings.
This movie was certainly filmed in the right place at the right time. It is Greek tragedy filled with chaos and uncertainty and populated by souls coming to a spiritual crossroads, thinking that they have made a substantial change in their lives, yet doing nothing but becoming more hedonistic, crazy and materialistic in the process. Kinda sounds like America in the sixty's, doesn't it?
This movie is an invaluable document describing the conciousness of people at a cross-roads looking toward an uncertain and materialistic future.
Richard Lester, Julie Christie Richard Chamberlain and Nic Roeg all four deserved Academy Awards for this film. However, I give them the first honorary Orson Welles award in tribute for unrecognized filmmaking beyond the call of duty.
I'll be loving this movie the rest of my days.
Oh yes, the Grateful Dead and Big Brother for a few moments in the film, a miniscule document of their musical presence in the city by the bay in the summer of love. Or was it the fall?",1181174400,4,2741,4.821656050955414
303918,5,6301008618,"Petulia happens to be one of my favority Richard Lester films and very cutting edge for its time.  I love Julie Christie and she glows in this movie.  George C Scott gives one of his best performances.  They play out an unusual love story - she is supposedly something of a ""Kook"" (it is based on the novel, ""Me and the Arch Kook Petulia"" but she is really something more than she seems.  Scott is a doctor whose marriage has ended and is at odds with his new life.  Richard Chamberlain plays Petulias husband, a handsome success who hides a deeper secret.

All this plays out in swinging San Franciso in 1968.  A higlight

of the film is the use of Janis Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company.  The ending will leave a bittersweet taste.

303929,5,6301008618,"I was really taken aback about how groundbreaking a film ""Petulia"" is but I really shouldn't have.  Richard Lester introduced some innovative techniques with ""A Hard Day's Night"" in 1964 but that gets overlooked because it was in the service of a musical comedy.  ""Petulia"" is a terrific marriage of acting, storytelling, and technique.  The title and cover art suggest a story about a mysterious woman named Petulia (Julie Christie).  The real puzzle that has to be unraveled is that of an emotionally remote doctor named Archie Bollen played by George C. Scott.  Combined with the cross-cutting and a superb performance by Scott we begin to unravel the essence of Archie.  There are terrific performances all around including Christie as the empathetic Petulia, Richard Chamberlain as her abusive husband, and Shirley Knight as Archie's neglected ex-wife.  Lester has provided great atmosphere here by capitalizing on the faces,places, and colors that were late sixties San Francisco.  Lester is aided by top-notch craftsmen in lensman Nic Roeg, a haunting score by John Barry, and also of note is the contribution of associate art director Dean Tavalouris who later worked extensively with Francis Ford Coppola.  It should be noted that ""Petulia"" received no Oscar nominations in 1968.",1154044800,7,1288,5.2745098039215685

Scott was quoted in a long ago publication called ""Memories,"" as saying he ""didn't understand a line of 'Petulia,' but the director seemed to know what he was doing.""  ""Petulia"" is worth seeing, but more as an artifact than as a lasting work of art.  It's simply too stilted, with too much artifice, especially with the often unnecessary cuts to images that, as critic Pauline Kael rightly points out, really add next to nothing to the drama we are witnessing. Despite Julie Cristie's incredibly beautiful presence, welcome in any film, the best scene in the film is between George C. Scott and Shirley Knight, as a just divorced couple.  The scene builds to a believable, heartbreaking conclusion on Scott's bed with him kissing her in a way we see she's always wanted to be kissed by him - we see two people who left too much of themselves out of their marriage and now, at the end, realize it. Knight is first rate in this film - beautifully nuanced, but with a hard core to her that she can't quite break free of.  This is true for all of the characters, in one way or another, and there are many marvelous touches of dialogue that go a long way to making this a worthwhile film. But the central coupling of Scott and Christie is simply not fully explored enough - we don't really SEE either the physical or the mental or spiritual attraction - and we have to.  The dialogue between them doesn't really build. And the chemistry between Scott and Christie is odd and off putting (check out the lack of kissing - when Christie does kiss him, they're just pecks). There is an outstanding film waiting to get out here, but this is not it.  It's diverting, interesting, but ultimately unsatisifying - and, in its choice of somewhat cheap jump cuts, and the absolutely awful acting by those in bit parts - not worthy of being considered a great film.",1153612800,13,1858,4.547904191616767

When that happened I pounded my fist on the chair and said 'They're finally releasing it!' So much so that I pre-ordered it and it's going to be coming to my doorstep when it's released!

303936,5,6301008618,"Petulia is a brave film. It is not a picture easy to swallow, because it is a demolishing portrait of moral human beings in a decadent world.

Every one of these depicted characters has something to pay, because all of them are incapable to realize his or her potential, in search of the total fulfillment of an ethic compromise trying to satisfy the whole expectations of those people whom they love.

This awful disorientation process obeys to a sorrowful and probably unconscious self destructive impulse. Lester would seem to underline the terrible ethic abyss between the undeniable advances of all order in an opulent society and a hunger soul, lack of communication, affection and love.

Petulia represents the new order. She wants to live several lives in just one; Oliver is his personal hobby, she intends desperately to find the perfect man, and through this self convincing, tries to join the pieces of a messy puzzle, with the best of both men. There is self indulgence, compassion and a serious stage of ambitioned change but without risking. That state of mind only can lead to assume the life as impersonal experience, because you are not able to face your own demons. She possesses the force enough to change of mind but not the necessary courage to give the final leap. That fact is underlined dramatically in the last lines of the film, when she pronounces the name Archie before falling asleep. Somehow you can realize certain similitude with Rosebud, admitting the sleep is a brief evasion, where the happiness in case of being absent, you have to invent it by yourself through the most common of devices; the conformism, that represents a symbol of inaction or renounce.

The rest of the characters are subject to life 's fluctuations, and this brief encounter of vanished illusions comes nowhere but it simply transform.

But finally the time has come for this film to rescue it and conferring its genuine value as one of the most mature films of the American Cinema in any age, proving this way Ingmar Bergman concerns through his relevant career do not seem to be so distant from this border of the Atlantic. This is undeniably Mark Lester ` major artistic stature film ever made!

So consider this film as well The swimmer( see my review about it) as the best exponents of the Author Cinema in 1968. Go for both of them.",1136073600,2,2346,4.780246913580247
303937,5,6301008618,"I saw PETULIA years ago & although I remembered liking it very much, I don't really think I ""got it"" before.  But I recently saw it again & this time it really hit home. I got it for background research because I just wrote up an interview with screenwriter Barbara Turner about her new film THE COMPANY.  (For all the talk about Richard Lester in this thread, no one's mentioned Turner's contribution as if, what -- it wrote itself?)  It's no wonder Pauline Kael didn't like it.  Great as she was in many ways, Kael was not particularly sympathetic to women's issues (or women filmmakers for that matter), so her review seems to miss the central point: Petulia is a battered woman trapped for economic & social reasons in a brutal marriage.  Amazing stuff for 1968!  You can read my interview with Turner on [...] if you're interested.  Among other things you'll learn that Robert Altman was originally supposed to direct PETULIA.  Imagine that!",1073606400,,946,4.725609756097561
303938,5,6301008618,"Richard Lester's hazy ""Petulia"" is Top Ten list material, in my opinion. More the prototype for Soderberg's ""The Limey"" than even ""Point Blank"" was, this film is a masterpiece of fractured time, subjective narration, and non-linear editing.
""Petulia"" tells the story of two very different people whose lives irrevocably intersect in a vague search for place and self in the 1960s. Lester claims to have shaped ""Petulia""'s characters as symbols of 1960s America, and yet rarely has the cinema offered such complex and three-dimensional characters. The title character in particular, played by Julie Christie, is a young ""kook"" recently married into comfortable wealth, and whose behavior is not only unpredicatable, but erratic to the point of schizophrenia. George C. Scott's Archie is a rather serious doctor in the midst of a divorce (he terminated his marriage, he says, because he'd tired of being ""a handsome couple"") and making a rather forced effort to enjoy new bachelorhood. In the opening scene, Petulia tells Archie, ""I've been married six months and I've never had an affair."" After much discussion, but no kissing, Archie and Petulia decide, almost out of resignation, to have an affair. What these characters take from each other is a very complicated thing, which I can only describe as brief protection from what seems inevitable loneliness. Certainly they're an interesting pair. ber-critic Pauline Kael describes Julie Christie's portrayal of Petulia as ""lewd and anxious, expressive and empty, brilliantly faceted but with something central missing, almost as if there's no woman inside."" I couldn't say it better myself. George C. Scott's Archie is a brilliantly understated masculine foil to this Petulia. Richard Combs wrote of him in Film Comment as representative of a type ""reduced to inertia, impotence, terminal ambivalence by the fact that they see too clearly and feel too keenly the compromises that society demands.""
Kael is quite hard on this film. I'd characterize most of her criticisms of ""Petulia"" as reactionary, but because she's Pauline Kael, they're worth hearing out. Kael writes of ""Petulia"" as a ""come-dressed-as-the-sick-soul-of-America-party."" Though certainly there's a heavy dose of 60s existential angst, I'd say one of the most striking things about ""Petulia"" is its characters' refusal to fit neatly *as characters,* much less as archetypes, or even to operate at the service of the narrative (as you'd expect of people who are, frankly, figments of that narrative). This works brilliantly with the film's themes of disillusionment and confused identity in a time of both personal and cultural upheaval. ""Petulia"" was filmed in San Francisco at the tail end of the Summer of Love and released in the wake of youth movements that exploded throughout the west in `68. Rather than showcasing the socio-historical import of the era, Lester soaks up all the disillusionment of a major letdown. (Kael calls ""Petulia"" Lester's ""hate letter to America."") In ""Petulia,"" free-spiritedness reveals itself as irresponsibility, passion gives way to rage, and self-preservation is confused for selfishness. Consequences loom large over Archie and Petulia.
Antony Gibbs' editing is key here. Flashes backward and forward in time and memory weave throughout ""Petulia."" Brief ellipses of violence, guilt, and regret interrupt and even haunt the narrative like irrepressible thoughts and compulsive memories. Again, Archie and Petulia cannot confrom to the narrative - their very thoughts disrupt it. Gibbs' editing almost dictates the film's style more than Lester's direction does. Its also one of the things Kael most strongly attacked. ""The images of `Petulia' don't make valid connections, they're joined together for shock and excitement,"" she said. The rant goes on, saying Gibbs' editing was ""the most insanely obvious method of cutting film ever devised; keep the audience jumping with cuts, juxtapose startling images, anything for effectiveness."" On paper, this is a valid criticism of fractured, cubist editing. But in the particular case of this film I think the editing's value skyrockets as a means of getting deep inside our two main characters.
But moving on, ""Petulia"" is above all a film about people *within a time and place.* ""Petulia"" is cluttered with electric razors, remote-controlled fireplaces, elevators, and other gadgets of better living. Archie in particular is given real depth by his consistent placement in mininal steel-and-glass interiors. (Nicolas Roeg's photography is very much in line with what he did once he began directing.) Archie's apartment is both grand and modern with high ceilings and walls that glow with white sleekness. Occasional pieces of abstract art decorate the space, pieces one can imagine Archie hand-picking with conviction but little interest. Archie's presence sits somewhere between strong, understated strength and classical refinement. Archie's time with Petulia is clearly the most significant of his forays into bachelorhood and into the zeitgeist of the day. Richard Combs correctly notes that Petulia becomes ""the measure by which everything else falls short."" It's difficult to speak on how well the two personalities get along, except perhaps to say that each is certainly changed for its time with the other. There is true and painful awkwardness in every interaction in ""Petulia,"" due largely to the obligations attached to each character's role in each relationship. The reality of each character's unique responsibilities to each other character in the film becomes downright oppressive - fascinating in the context of what was to be remembered as the height of glorious irresponsibility. Petulia, in part a representation of the carefree lifestyle associated with San Francisco in 1968, is no more free of these roles and their responsibilities than Archie is. The great accomplishment of Petulia and Archie's relationship is its attempt to transcend these roles. When the two decide at the film's opening to have an affair, it seems as though they've gravitated to one another partly for the total lack of context for their relationship. As such a pair, they could be, and certainly try to be, heroes of a modern landscape that separately, and ultimately, they are confined by.",1043107200,43,6288,5.397761953204476

7808818,3,6301008618,"Absolutely nihilistic statement about the wealthy of 1968 San Francisco Bay Area.  One is a surgeon fed up with wife and two sons, left with a cold heart and soul and yearning for emotion.  He finds it at a fundraiser at the famous Fairmont Hotel atop Nob Hill where he is pursued by a much younger married woman, played by Julie Christie, six months married to a hydraulic engineer, played by a nasty and narcissistic Richard Chamberlain.

Julie Christie is the consummate soulless rich unemployed woman who seeks affairs with married wealthy men, or men just divorcing, for the fun of it.  Her life and head are vacuous and she likes to play the kookie type, much like Audrey Hepburn as a single woman in Breakfast at Tiffany's.  But dumb she is not.  Calculating and manipulative with men she is, and all personal questions her surgeon lover puts to her she deflects with care and concern over his fatigue and worn face and long hard hours.",1477872000,,943,4.650602409638554
