8277777,5,B0007U84D8,"This is the best historical summary of the American Marines in the Pacific Campaign.  The combination of  first-hand accounts, letters, artwork, and color film of the Marines is the best presentation.  The viewer gets the real aspect from the Leatherneck's  point of view.  His hardships: physical, emotional, and mental are clear and understandable.  The motivation  of the American Marine can be easily comprehended and visualized.  The one hour video packs more into it than most books on the subject.  If your a teacher it would be a great tool to teach American students of Americans commitment and fortitude in the Second World War.  A must for any one who wants to see the real war  in the pacific.",1487635200,,705,4.889830508474576
8277778,5,B0007U84D8,"This is by far one of the best documentaries about the Pacific campaign I have seen. Narrated by the great actor Lee Marvin who was one of the Marines who fought in the island battles. It was made in 1967 so there is no propaganda here, the marines story is told here the way it happened. It also shows the human side, marines taking care of wounded Japanese prisoners and even giving them their blood. For the price you can`t go wrong its an excellent documentary.",1121558400,,465,4.4186046511627906
