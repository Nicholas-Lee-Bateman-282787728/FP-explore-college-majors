2318540,5,B0009TIAI6,"Fantastic, well done. A most treasured old testament book beautifully portrayed. God continues to speak through one of the most uncompromising, faithful to God no matter what the cost, politicians ever to walk this earth. God I want to be like him.",1383091200,86,248,4.928571428571429
2318541,5,B0009TIAI6,So often too much artistic license is taken in Biblical movies and things are added contrary to the story.  I was very pleased at how closely it followed the biblical and historical accounts.  I will be using this with my students in our study of Daniel.,1382745600,249,254,4.5
2318542,3,B0009TIAI6,This movie was just OK.  There could have more trappings (set design) and the characters all spoke in a monatone voice.  I think needed more voice inflection.  If you have read the Bible there would have been more characters.  I expected more from the Pureflex people.,1382486400,,268,4.760869565217392
2318543,5,B0009TIAI6,"A superb retelling on the life of Daniel. Considering the budget/restrictions making a low budget film, this movie shines. Excellent acting from Robert Miano, Lance Henrickson and Andrew Bongiorno carry the piece. The writing is rock solid and very impressive. Overall I highly suggest this piece.",1382486400,2,297,5.478260869565218
2318544,4,B0009TIAI6,"I actually read the book of Daniel but I would assume the are the same in many ways. It really made me think about my faith reading the first parts of the book where Daniel and his friends are tested spiritually in the presence of the king. you wouldn't really think the Bible would be suspenseful but when Daniel was thrown in the lion's den no one could foresee what was going to happen. About two thirds of the way in it gets a little confusing, Daniel has a  few confusing dreams and visions that really God and Daniel understand. In the very end it talks about the end time and what will happen to people when Jesus comes for the second time. All in all it had all the characteristics of a novel but it happens to be God's word's not a human author.",1381622400,5,754,4.2
2318545,3,B0009TIAI6,"After ""The Book of Esther"", my expectations were very low. ""The Book of Daniel"" was better. It's still a bit slow moving and the budget limitations are obvious, but it doesn't look like it was filmed in someone's basement and the acting is better (maybe first time director Anna Zielinski is a better director than David A.R. White, who let Jennifer Lyons get away with one of the most embarrasing performances of the year in ""Book of Esther""). Robert Miano carries the movie quite well and we also get a solid performance by Lance Henriksen in a smaller role. And, unlike ""Esther"", I can't think of any other ""Daniel"" movies so this one didn't give me that ""I've seen it all before and done better""-feeling. Not a great movie but may be worth checking out for those who like Biblical movies.",1381536000,31,792,4.624113475177305
2318546,5,B0009TIAI6,"I thought this was a very well done Bible story. It followed the story well, and was produced well. It is not animated, tho it sort of looks that way on the cover. Good cinematography, serious acting. Robert Miano as Old Daniel [telling the story] seemed very sincere in his role. I was able to borrow mine, so it does not show as a Verified Purchase on this Review.",1381017600,135,366,4.318840579710145
2318547,1,B0009TIAI6,"I bought this DVD and it just isn't workable.  It will not play on any of my DVD players, and I have many of them--top of the line players.  I love good Biblical DVDs, and I buy many of them; but, on this one, I would definitely have to say, ""Don't waste your money.",1302307200,,266,3.9074074074074074
2318548,5,B0009TIAI6,"It follows the life of Daniel, hitting the high notes from the Bible. The only thing I would add would be a realistic portrayal of his youth when he refused the rich foods, and requested vegetables and water.",1523664000,,208,4.5

2318557,5,B0009TIAI6,Kids loved this movie,1521676800,,21,4.5
2318558,5,B0009TIAI6,I bought this movie to view with my Bible Connection group at church. The story is followed very closely to the story in the Bible. Actors were cast very well in the characters they were portraying. We like seeing stories from the Bible portrayed on the screen because it makes the story come to life for us and makes us understand the story better.,1521590400,,349,4.46875
2318559,3,B0009TIAI6,"Unfortunately, this movie is very slow and the portrayal of Daniel is weak.",1520899200,,75,4.846153846153846
2318560,2,B0009TIAI6,"The Book of Daniel was a big disappointment when it came to the three Hebrew boys: Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.  In Daniel 3:25, ...and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God. It  plainly stated the Son of God, which is Jesus Christ and not an angel of God, which the movie stated. Most people do not see or understand the importance of that verse. It is very important to know and understand that Jesus was around before time was created and not just born in a manger doing King Herod time. Jesus is part of the trinity: The Father(God) the Son(Jesus) and the Holy Spirit(mind of God). That is why is He is the only Savior of this world when He came down and was born in a manger and died on the cross.  Jesus said, I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.  The Holy Bible testify this throughout it's pages from Genesis to Revelation concerning Jesus . I could not view the dvd any further, so I destroyed the dvd because I did not want someone to think  by giving them this movie that Jesus is an angel of God and not the Son of God.",1520726400,2,1078,4.138755980861244
2318561,5,B0009TIAI6,Good movie.  Daniel is one of my favorite Old Testament people.,1520726400,,63,4.7272727272727275
2318562,5,B0009TIAI6,My aunt loved it!,1520467200,,17,3.5
2318563,2,B0009TIAI6,"The story of Daniel is incredible and his end times prophecies are critical to the Bible.  That said, I didn't care much for this movie.  I thought some of the acting left a lot to be desired.",1520380800,,192,4.162162162162162
2318564,1,B0009TIAI6,"cd did not work well, unable to see the movie, kept stopping.",1520380800,,61,4.166666666666667
2318565,1,B0009TIAI6,"I love the Bible story of Daniel and bought this DVD.  But the acting was terrible in this!  It was like watch a high school play, or even not as good as that!  The actors were American and their speaking was so awkward and terrible!  They had costumes on, but I kept thinking that they all looked like cowboys - - certainly NOT Persians!  Any Persian (or Iranian) must have been laughing their heads off at this terrible portrayal of their people!  The actors spoke in monotones with no expression at all.  I had to return this movie - it was just so bad!  This picture on the cover of the DVD is nice, but the movie has no quality.  I was disappointed as I was really looking for a good Biblical movie portrayal of the Daniel story.",1520208000,2,734,4.260869565217392
2318566,5,B0009TIAI6,All praise to Jesus! Great transaction. Fast delivery. Properly priced. A+,1520208000,,74,5.818181818181818
2318567,4,B0009TIAI6,good movie.,1519862400,,11,5.0
2318568,4,B0009TIAI6,My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. It's mostly true to the book but takes some liberties with the source material. The parent company PureFlix is associated with the Church of Latter Day Saints but I didn't find any part of the movie doctrinally controversial in anyway as a mainline Protestant. Appropriate for all ages.,1519516800,,327,4.857142857142857
2318569,5,B0009TIAI6,This is the most accurate Bible movie I have seen. I truly loved it.,1519516800,,68,3.9285714285714284
2318570,5,B0009TIAI6,I didn't think it would be too good..Once I popped it in I saw quite a few special effects and usually when a religious movie has good effects...It isn't going to be true to the story..Well this was actually rather close to the story and very well directed as well I was pleasantly surprised!,1519516800,,292,4.425925925925926
2318571,5,B0009TIAI6,I was surprised at how accurate this movie is. My hubby and I really enjoyed it and it's a good tool to help the kids get excited about the Bible.,1519344000,,146,3.9
2318572,5,B0009TIAI6,Loved the movie. It came quickly and packaging was very good. Very satisfied with purchase. Thank you.,1519084800,,102,5.0588235294117645

2318576,3,B0009TIAI6,"I'll be honest about my illiteracy when it comes to the Bible. The book of Daniel is recalled here in a film with a darling cast of largely male characters. Ironically, they are directed by a female director. I bought this DVD because one of my favorite actors, Rolf Saxon, played King Nebud in the film. Apart from the largely worded movie, there is a lot more dialogue than actions at times. The script reminds me of a Shakespearean drama except in Biblical times.

The DVD comes with special features like Behind the Scenes with the cast and crew including the director and actors. My favorites in the blooper reel were the cell phone ringing during one scene and the actors singing the classic song, ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight."" Yes, there are actual lions in the film.",1518307200,,771,4.627737226277373

2318589,4,B0009TIAI6,"Very good story line with above average acting.  So many of these Biblical films have such horrible acting, I can't sit through them.  This was better than expected and a good family movie.",1511654400,,189,4.696969696969697
2318590,5,B0009TIAI6,"I see where others gave negative reviews for one thing or another. But quite honestly I have enjoyed watching this movie over and over again. The Story line is Biblical, the actors seem Real I especially enjoyed the performance by Daniel (Robert Miano) Lance Henriksen (Cyrus) and Rolf Saxon (Nebuchadnezzar). If you're looking for a Technological Hollywood Blockbuster ""this Ain't it"" but if you're looking for a wonderfully portrayed Biblical family type movie and have a knowledge of the Bible then sit back with some popcorn and enjoy..",1511136000,,540,5.1477272727272725

2318592,3,B0009TIAI6,"I don't know what some of the reviewers were talking about when they gave this 5 stars. I am a Christian and purchased this based on those reviews. Even though it is pretty Biblically accurate, the acting (& clothing, etc.) was like I was watching a high school play. Kings crowns even looked like they were homemade. After being in the desert for 7 yrs, the kings haircut & beard were barber shop perfect. I could go on and on. Ouch. Painful to watch. But then who knows that their budget was to make this; obviously not much. Informative but that's about it. Sorry.",1510185600,,567,4.461538461538462

2318594,5,B0009TIAI6,"Great movie. It was on Netflix, but not anymore, so I bought it. Good examples of sticking to your guns. Yes, a little Hollywood is thrown in there and the sets are cheesy, but it's still a good story!",1509667200,,201,4.17948717948718

2318596,5,B0009TIAI6,"Good acting, well done narrative with a twist... Daniel narrates his story to Cyrus.  Don;t know that he did that as shown, but he likely did at some time.  This movie has the absolute best rendition of Daniel in the Lions den... reciting Psalms.  Great.  I bet he actually did that, or something close.",1509148800,,303,4.555555555555555

Daniel 3:92 in the Bible reads  >  ""Behold ... walking in the midst of the fire ... the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.""
The movie FALSIFIED this to > ""The form of the fourth looks like an Angel of God.""

And important visions of Daniel life ... that were omitted >

Daniel 9:26 >  ""Christ shall be slain: and the people that shall deny Him shall not be His.""
Daniel 7:13 > ""The vision of the night, and lo, one like the Son of Man came with the clouds of Heaven ... even to the Ancient of days.""",1506816000,6,551,4.018348623853211

2318607,5,B0009TIAI6,This was a really good movie I like that a lot. They did diverge a little bit from God's word. Remember the Lion's Den when Daniel was put in there? The very next day when he came out of that Den unharmed those who caused him to get into the den in the first place where then put into the den of the Lions them and their families. So was it a big guy version but I still think when you do a Biblical movie be as close as you can to it. But this was more on track than the movie Moses that I just saw recently,1504569600,,508,3.712962962962963

action.  And this book is rife with lots of good stories!!  Anyways, as far as authenticity to the letter of the book, it was very accurate.  It did not
deviate or take any liberties in portraying the story in a different light than what is in the original book from the Bible.  So, for authenticity and accuracy it was very good.

2318649,5,B0009TIAI6,GREAT MOVIE ... ARRIVED PERFECTLY,1487030400,,33,5.8
2318650,5,B0009TIAI6,"I am a Ph. D. student in Biblical Studies, studying in the book of Daniel for my dissertation, and I find that this movie is actually pretty well done. It begins with Daniel on his knees praying to God his prayer from Daniel chapter 9. A key feature of the movie is the prophet/seer Daniel meeting King Cyrus and explaining to him the central theme of the book of Daniel--how the LORD (Yahweh) God of Israel gives dominion to earthly kings and takes it away, using the kings as His own instruments in the world.  Good, well-grounded production!",1486425600,,544,4.551020408163265

2318654,4,B0009TIAI6,"This is one of my favorites. I felt it was well-conceived and thoughtfully developed, with the various scenes springing from a very significant conversation between Daniel and King Cyrus.  It inspires my faith every time, and Robert Miano is wonderful as the aged Daniel.  The movie stays fairly true to the Biblical account while successfully fleshing out the characters.  I took off one star because of a couple of scenes that were clearly low-budget, especially when they repeat the same panorama of the city of Babylon--it is clearly an artist's rendering and not live cinema.  And it was worth a snicker when they depicted the crazed Nebuchadnezzar crawling on all fours in the wilderness sporting a ten-dollar haircut, with his nails and beard nicely trimmed... Even so, this DVD is a treasure I will keep re-watching for many years to come.",1485302400,9,847,4.98581560283688
2318655,4,B0009TIAI6,"This was a good movie. Followed the Bible closely. The beginning was poor quality, but got better.",1485129600,,98,4.823529411764706
2318656,5,B0009TIAI6,Wonderful movie! It really tells the story of Daniel and the book along with the film tells a lot. I encourage anyone to read Daniel and the movie together.,1485043200,,156,4.413793103448276

2318665,3,B0009TIAI6,"This movie is clearly devoted to remaining true to scripture, but the sacrifices made (most likely due to budget) make the movie hard to immerse in.  It feels more like a bible study supplement than it does a feature film.  Still, it is interesting and helpful if you are studying the book and want a visual to go with your study this may be helpful.  I wish there was a greater demand for biblical films.",1483488000,5,405,4.373333333333333

2318669,5,B0009TIAI6,"The parts of this film that depict God rescuing those who seek Him in distress were my favorite. God should be illuminated in our minds always. We are deluded in thinking that there is no evil. In thinking that there is no Master for us to contemplate on and seek direction from and deliverance by every single hour of our lives. Our life does not begin here. Here is the trick-test. Well done. I was touched in a good way while watching this film. Especially I liked Robert Miano, Lance Henriksen, and Peter Kluge.",1482710400,,515,4.48936170212766

2318674,4,B0009TIAI6,"Too long spent on fall of Babylon;  the language chosen was archaic (probably New King James), and thus hard for my students to understand.  We used subtitles and that helped, but using modern English would have been a big positive.

We loved the (relative) faithfulness to the Biblical text.  There were very few instances when the script wandered far from the truth-narratives shared in scripture.",1481500800,,399,5.092307692307692

2318688,3,B0009TIAI6,"The sound quality isn't good, nor is the lighting. I needed to apply the captions to understand what was being said. The entire picture was darker than it needed to be. The acting is good, but the story moves at a snail's pace, jumping from the present to the past. There is very little action. The actors do little more than sit or stand in one place and deliver their lines. The movie actually put me to sleep a couple of times. It's an OK film, but I'll never watch this DVD again.",1478736000,,484,4.21505376344086

So I bought the dvd for my teen daughters to watch bc we homeschool and we're doing a class based on the kings of Israel. We got to the prophet section on Daniel, so I thought I'll get this movie and have them watch this for class. They moaned a little, but I made them watch it anyway by themselves. So afterwards I said how did you like? They said we loved it and they went on to tell about all their favorite parts. They loved the young characters chosen for Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abendago. They liked how they did the scene for the fiery furnace, and the lions den scene. They liked how the older Daniel was telling his story to the last king he was under rule of and prophesying. I was surprised how much they enjoyed the movie, bc my teens are the toughest critics. I was expecting more moaning after they watched it. I was glad they gave it a chance, and they enjoyed it.",1464480000,4,988,4.205263157894737

2318777,5,B0009TIAI6,"Amazing movie. Well done movie-wise. It also makes you really think and realize that God is king and does what he wants. He is in control, not man. Very biblically based movie.

2318779,5,B0009TIAI6,I am really impressed with this production of The Book of Daniel.  It tells the whole story and the acting as well as the production are excellent.  I bought it to show to my Sunday School class in segments; it is almost 1.5 hours long.  It won't play on our old DVD player at church but plays fine at home.  I guess our church  needs a new DVD player.,1456531200,,352,4.043478260869565
2318780,3,B0009TIAI6,This movie is very accurate but very very boring. This movie was probably shot all in one room with very minimal props. The acting is ok. I guess I was just expecting more by the reviews it received. It is an accurate account of the book of Daniel so if you want to learn about Daniel or as in my case review Daniel chapters 1-6 for my Bible Class it is good but it definitely is not keeping the attention of teenagers.,1456272000,,419,4.121951219512195

2318783,2,B0009TIAI6,"The Book of Daniel, arguably one of the most important books of the Old Testament, deserves a better film than this lame low budget effort.  I think the story of Daniel is timely for any age and especially now in our era.  Why those who make Bible movies are not sticking closer to the wonderful source material is beyond me.  I can say two good things about this film:  It is not as awful as the filmed version of Jeremiah - which seemed to resemble the Biblical account in its Title only - and the cover does depict Daniel in the Lion's Den magnificently.  Aim for realism Bible filmmakers...you have a great source.  Please use it.",1455321600,,634,4.422413793103448

2318794,3,B0009TIAI6,"I bought the DVD somewhere else and I think it is ""ok"". This is such a low budget project hat you almost feel for the crew having to work with so many limitations. This story is BIG and needs BIG production like the Hobbit. It was good for what the production and cast had to work with. I think Old Daniel has a voice that is way too feeble, and sometimes it is almost comedic how he sounds, like he is about to totally lose his voice",1452470400,,434,4.0

2318816,5,B0009TIAI6,"My friends, People attempt to make stories like this into religions.

When is the ""Truth"" not the ""TRUTH"" ? Think about this now, because for me it's when it's a ""Particle"" truth. Too much ""Wholly Weird"" for me...

 This is just one more reason why God doesnt want us to believe in religions of any kind. These books were put together by God inspiring certain people to put down into Words what God Himself wanted published as written Words telling the TRUTH. Thats it, and to learn from them, by God! His Will IS Done, on Earth as it is in Heaven, not ours.

 God and His most beloved Son Jesus the Christ do NOT have anything whatsoever to do with the cults or politics of mankind.

 In the first place religion is a man made method of gaming on peoples love for God.

 It is the tail end of politics which rips off the peoples wages in the form of taxes and ordnance fines of one kind or another and religion takes over when its time to take a Godly rest from our labors in the form of a Sabbath rest.

 Their avatar is a snake swallowing its own tail. http://www.whale.to/b/snake_tail.html

And there you have it; how people got around to saying;  Money is the root of all Evil!

 Its all a giant miracle unfolding right before our very own eyes and yet a lot of viewers cant comprehend it.

 Personally, I don't just believe in miracles, I depend on them!

 Our Lord God did not create us to be filled with Satanic fear, but the Spirit of the Holy Ghost, that's why Jesus cried out; ""IT IS FINISHED!"" so don't worry, be happy! Mazel Tov!

 My friends, when it comes to speculating, it never ends...

 And don't be deceived about what spirit is whom either...!!

 .. the Holy Spirit of God Himself Created His One and only Son, Jesus the Christ... through the Earthly handmaid of a Hebrew virgin girl named Mary... so that's One Spirit, God the Father's Spirit..

 Jesus the Christ, gave up His Life willingly on the cross at Calvary, ( no one took it from Him, or He would have died in vain.""), so that He could give up the ""Ghost"", that He told His disciples will from thereon seek to live, teach, heal and Baptize through the hearts and minds of the believers of Gods most beloved Son, Jesus the Christ, the same way Peter did, the ""Rock"" from which we were carved from, his spiritual knowledge, and the Corner Stone Jesus, Chief Architect of His Church, ( the Holy Ghost) the One True Light of mankind through which only Him can one find personal salvation and no where else!

 Thank You Lord Jesus!

 Just so you know the difference.

Now, remembering that the ""Word"" is God and should not be misused or abused as the ""Word has the ""POWER"" of giving life or issuing forth death we should use great care in what comes from our pens or mouth...

 Like the kings edicts and the muzzles of the guns secularists or unbelievers like to brandish about as a means of using fear to control the mobs against the psychotic people who are in charge of our nations military might and are using it for their own corporate interests which translates to treating us as a heard of animals, they should be very mindful of where they are pointing those weapons grade Words, and at whom and what they desire to change with that Great POWER.

 Because God can do anything and LEAST WE FORGET, He is the Word, He can make changes exactly theoppositeof what mankind expects to see from exploiting their faulty wisdoms through a corrupted knowledge from which were predicated false existences built upon prevarications contrived from people with differing values or divided interests hence God said if you don't want to believe the pure simple Truth out of a Pure Godly Love, then here, have a whispered shadow of something burned, a Strong Delusion, says the Lord, so that the liars will themselves believe the lie!

 2 Thessalonians 2:9. Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, 10. And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received NOT the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 22. And for this cause God shall send them STRONG DELUSION, that they should believe a lie:12. That THEY ALL MIGHT BE DAMNED who believed not the Truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness

 Gods creation is so perfect that there is no thing that isn't under His control, Good, Bad or Indifferent.

 God created it all even His only begotten Son, Jesus the Christ Savior of Mankind.

 And He Created this particular Light,( He named Jesus, a very POWERFUL name that evil can not tolerate)smack dab in the middle of our mind ( the vagus nerve ) and our heart, ( thoracic cardio-pulmonary organs ), where its absolutely void of any visible light whatsoever.

 So then That Light shines in a true darkness, and the darkness still, comprehends it not, in a lot of instances... John 1:5= Revelation 3:20 <== You are welcome to sup with the Lord Jesus, in [Secret] Matthew 6:6, in [Secret] protected by Psalm 91, in [Secret]

 So what I see our Father in heaven doing is;

 Planning His Work and working His Plan.

 Because where there is Gods will, there is a Way.

 Therefore, the More we Know,

 The more we Know we don't Know,

 So, Good, Better, Best,

 Our Lord Jesus never lets it rest,

 Until the Good is the better,

 And the Better is the Best,

 Then He says,

 IT IS FINISHED!

 Thank You Lord Jesus!

 Therefore those of us who do see the Light are generally of good courage in the nature of our Lord Jesus Love, and knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord-- we therefore know we walk byFAITH, and not bySIGHT-- most who are of that mindframe, are of good courage, ( BOLD ) I say, and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.

 Joel 2:28, And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: And I think Ms Renee Moses out of her Love for Christ Jesus, is telling us what Jesus is telling her through the indwelling Holy Ghost, then relaying to us the message as the Holy Ghost relates it to her, however as she has stated herself on occasion, ""she is NOT a prophetess"" so don't go sour on what is happening or not, because it's the Lords Will that's done on Earth, NOT MANS nor WOMBMANS!...

 An apology, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVKugqJmHYc

This is my story Renee N. Moses. { https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dPrRCwuL-g

 and as for me, Im an old man; of (77), way past the Biblical amount of time people are said to exist, ie. three score and ten years, and no one can say I didn't try to go home to our Lord Jesusa little too early for our Lord God it appears.

 Because., as it was in the days of Moses when he came back from talking with God on Sinai, his face showed it. as well, the proof of that for me in my case, is the look on my face today, it too shows it and for the same reason I might add, no one talks face to Face with God, without some manner of change taking place upon your physical or spiritual being at the moment of your epiphany.

 Repent and be Baptized in the name of Jesus Christ!.

 Thank You Lord Jesus! Amen!

 Now quit fretting and sit back and enjoy what time there is to live here on this planet knowing that you are saved by His Sacrifice and ~ LOVE ~ for His Church. Its enough to make kings and vagabonds think the very Best!

 He who knows not LOVE and FORGIVENESS, does NOT know our Lord God Jesus the Christ!

 Know Jesus, know Peace.

 No Jesus, no Peace!

 Hallelujah, even so, come Lord Jesus come!",1444176000,15,7642,4.410752688172043

2318858,4,B0009TIAI6,"""...And among them all was found none like Daniel"" (Daniel 1:19 KJV). THE BOOK OF DANIEL within the Old Testament portion of the Holy Bible, was inspired by the Holy Spirit and actually written down by one of the revelatory Prophets, named: Daniel. But consequently, because the reigning King of Jerusalem was an arrogant, weak and treacherous coward, who was also unfaithful to the Lord and idolatrous of his own unstable mindset by willfully ignoring the prophetic warnings of the Prophet Jeremiah, brought down his own reign and his kingdom. And oh!..., how the innocent people, suffered. Specifically, Jerusalem was destroyed, the teenaged Daniel and his fellow Hebrews were captured and exiled to Babylon by the conquering Babylonian King - Nebuchadnezzar. There to remain, in captivity and servitude for 70 years. During the long years of bondage and captivity within a pagan nation with foreign rulers, Daniel was placed into the King's Court because of his exceptional wisdom, understanding and integrity which the Lord had given him. In fact, he was so highly favored, admired and respected by the Babylonian King, that he changed Daniels' name to a Babylonian one, that being: Belteshazzar (Daniel 2:26 KJV). Over the course of years, Daniel continued to distinguish himself with each new King, and rose to the position of an Advisor and then, Prime Minister. After having proven his faithfulness to the Lord while fasting for 3 weeks rather than eating food that had been sacrificed to idols. And by telling the King what his dream was and giving him the interpretation of that dream (the giant statue), when none of the Kings' sorcerers, could. He further interpreted the ominous handwriting on the wall and was thrown into the den of lions, due to the conniving jealousy of the Kings' other advisors. And, so much more. Such was the intrigue that went on in the Kings' court, palace and government, as well as, religious worship... as relating to Daniel. This insightful, single-disc, color, DVD which is approximately 88-minutes long, depicts some of the intense trials that Daniel experienced before and after, he became Prime Minister in Babylon and the rewards that he reaped because he stood his ground regarding his faith. This DVD is spiritually educational, insightful, historical and accurate, as per the pages of the Holy Bible. And simply put, it is entertaining and a very interesting film from Pureflix.

Also of note - the movie doesn't include anything from the second half of the book of Daniel (chapters 7-12) (although I understand why this is the case).

And, this movie is presented as being a presentation of a Jewish myth.  As a born again Christian, I believe that the events as recorded in the book of Daniel are true.

2318868,5,B0009TIAI6,"I was truly floored when I watched this movie. The stories from Daniel are some of the ones I most remember from childhood. It is amazing what they did with a small budget in the production of this movie. Robert Miano was excellent as Daniel. The movie starts with an elderly Daniel praying, reminding God that He had promised that after 70 yrs He would allow His people to return to the land of Israel. He encounters Cyrus and asked him for permission to tell him the story of 4 kings, one who was great, one who was foolish, one who was deceived, and one who was to be regarded as wise for ages to come. The story then begins with Daniel describing the events that took place after he and his friends were carried into Babylon. The acting is excellent and the story is portrayed more accurately than any Biblical movie made to date. Even the dialog of Cyrus about his upbringing is backed up by historical records of the time and handed down tradition. It accurately records the testimony of the kings Nebuchadnezzar, Darius, and Cyrus when they declared that they had realized that the Eternal God was the only true God. I knew the Biblical record which simply states that God stirred up the spirit of Cyrus but never really thought about HOW exactly He did so, this movie shows it in a way that is both clever and in all probability is accurate. Why else would Isiah record the command to Cyrus unless Cyrus was to have it read to him?

This movie is well worth the money and is one that you will either want to lend or buy as a gift to others. The only other movie based on the Bible that is any where near as accurate is the movie Joseph http://www.amazon.com/Joseph-Bible-Collection-Various/dp/B0007VY404/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1436676393&sr=1-1&keywords=joseph  both of these are ""must have"" movies.",1436572800,4,1819,4.753164556962025

It's real hard to find films today that are Biblically accurate and not flawed (seriously) in Biblical accuracy.  This is an exception.  It's mainly only hindered by having to be low budget.  Low budget means the effects are not good, nor do the kings and empires look anything like the real power they had...but, the story is accurate to the Bible in what it tells.

Other reviewers have been impatient with the pace of the film or its acting talent, but I was in no way convinced by their nit-picking and small-minded criticisms.  If you are accustomed to action films that move at a break-neck speed, then the unfolding of a story, told in depth and with much respect for its subject MAY seem a bit ""slow"" to you.  But do we really need frantic pacing and constant camera cuts to race us through the Book of Daniel?  This is a story of Daniel's persistent faith during the reign of four different kings of Babylon.  He tells the story in an intimate setting, through his memories of the past years, showing how he saw God's hand at work behind the great events of the times he in which he lived.  The actors pour their hearts into their roles and the computer graphics needed to show the city and other images is perfectly adequate, as are the sets, costumes, and props.  It's the overall TONE that is so satisfying to me--a reverence for God and his word, as well as an obvious desire to tell a good story!

The acting of the cast, from Daniel to the smallest roles, are nearly perfect, confident and true to their role.

And the lions: I must say the lions in this movie are my favorites, among all other Daniel-in-the-lion-den scenes in similar movies, even the lions in this movie acted well!

One thing I have to point out though: the palace of the kings seems to be the smallest I've seen in movies, but wonderful things the producers have done, to bring forth such performance, even in simple, but to-the-point, set-up as this movie.

In short, this movie would be one of our treasured dvds for repeated viewing, for it is a well acted movie with substance to it.",1415491200,2,834,4.659863945578231

2319043,4,B0009TIAI6,"The Good:

The film was well-written. It did a great job covering every facet of Daniel's amazing life as covered in the Bible. Most films will focus only on the lions den but this goes in depth. I enjoyed more than the episode of, The Bible which focused on Daniel. Most adaptations of Biblical narratives will require some speculation to fill in blanks that a movie but the Bible doesn't cover and I really liked how this movie did that.  I love the idea that Daniel was so dedicated and so faithful to King Darius that he advised there was no legal loophole and that Daniel be thrown into the lion's Den quickly so as not to give fuel to the King's political enemies. That the faith and faithfulness of Daniel. I also liked the scenes of Daniel discussing Isaiah's prophecy regarding Cyrus with Cyrus. Although I doubt it happened, it did a good job communicating through film the amazing nature of Isaiah's prophecy.

The film had some solid performances including Robert Miano as Old Daniel, really embodying the role of an Old Testament prophet  and Rolf Saxon was great as Nebuchadnezzar.

The Bad:

The film featured some cheesy performances, mostly from minor characters such as the Babylonian astrologers. Of the more important players, Lance Henriksen seemed  too subdued as Cyrus.

Costuming was a problem particularly with jewelry. Because of his jewelry, one of the astrologers reminded me of a rapper. When Belshazzar gave Daniel the gold chain, it looked so obviously fake like a prop from a church play.

The one scene the direction really let down was the finger of God writing on the wall. The scene went too fast with Belshazzar demanding a solution before the finger finished. That's a moment that would have been better with people terrified and then we get the King's response.

Overall, though, this movie is good for what it is: a well written, low budeget faithful DVD adaptation of the life of Daniel. I enjoyed it.",1410566400,2,1942,4.7701492537313435

It was Biblically based and right on the mark with Scripture of the Old Testament.  I did not give it 5 stars as the actor playing Daniel was very soft spoken and many in my class are hard of hearing.  I could not find close caption on the movie.  However, it was visually excellent

2319073,5,B0009TIAI6,"What I liked about this movie was how they told of the four kings who ruled over Israel during their captivity in Babylon. I had read the true story in the Bible but was a little confused on the kings. This movie explains the difference in the personalities and how they ruled. I enjoyed this movie a lot. Plus, they used real lions in the den and the actor who played Daniel had to act with them. Very dangerous stuff. Excellent movie and definitely worth watching.",1403913600,,466,4.430232558139535
2319074,5,B0009TIAI6,"I was looking for something else when I found this movie, and I am so glad I did. I thought they just put the Lion on the cover to get you to buy it, but I was wrong.  This movie The Book of Daniel is true to The Book of Daniel in the BIBLE.  THE HAND WRITING IS STILL ON THE WALL AND WE DON'T EVEN SEE IT.  GOD IS NOT PLEASE WITH AMERICA, EVERYTHING GOD SAID IS A SIN WE SAY IT'S OKAY.  WE MUST SAY WHAT GOD SAYS.",1403740800,,414,3.566666666666667
2319075,5,B0009TIAI6,"I'm so happy to be able to write a positive review of a film based on the Bible that doesn't require any caveat or conditional statements based on scriptural compromise! I became aware of my own cynicism as I watched the film, as I waited for something to be grievously out of step with scripture, something distasteful, or some gross artistic ""license"" employed by the filmmakers; but instead of getting worse, the movie only got better. By the end, I had cried and rejoiced that someone had the courage to make such an accurate film.

I'm only guessing, but I would say 65-70% of the film was almost straight scripture. Consider me stunned! Much like another favorite film of mine (The Miracle Maker, a stop-motion animation film about Jesus), The Book of Daniel places scriptural events within a story which the writers have extrapolated from the texts. While this in no way makes those elements biblical, they serve as a realistic setting for the story. The Book of Daniel is not going to win any awards for acting, sets, or costumes; but the man who plays Daniel delivers a truly compelling performance. If you're like me and prefer biblical accuracy to any of those things, you will love this film. Enjoy.",1403654400,,1211,4.739336492890995

2319083,5,B0009TIAI6,"his movie is wonderful. It sticks very closely to the scriptures regarding Daniel and his relationship with King Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar, and Darius. With terrific special effects featured the viewer sees the three Hebrews, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, walk in the midst of the burning fiery furnace and suddenly a fourth figure walking with them, one that protects them from the flames. We see Belshazzar and his impending doom after he drinks from the goblets and vessels used in the service of the temple of the Hebrews. We see the envy of three rulers who attempt to trick the king into killing Daniel in the lion's den. But to their amazement Daniel survives and it is they who must face severe judgment.

Sex: None
Language: None
Violence: A blade is held to a man's throat a few times but he is fine; swords held on men; a man is killed with a sword in a brief and non-graphic scene; lions are seen showing interest in a character in the lion's den.
Drugs: The drinking of wine in a few scenes; a party in which a man faces sudden judgment.

2319112,2,B0009TIAI6,"Maybe if you didn't kidnap them, they'd ""serve"" you better?

I have never read the bible so I had no idea who Daniel was but I knew from Simon Scharma's lastest documentary series that this was the first of great crimes against the Jewish people which removed them from their homeland.  This movie  glosses over the fact that Daniel's people suffered a huge injustice and that he was kidnapped and forced to serve his transgressers and jumps into his tormentors seeking wise counsel from the injured party.

I have been on the receiving end of service providers who refuse to fulfill their fiduciary duty and represent their client's best interests so I know it sucks.  But as far as I know, I have never wronged the service provider as Daniel was wronged.

This is a story of foreign kings being advised by their ""slave"" Daniel.  The first king was advised to be unfrugal and build a giant gold statue in his image and force others to worship him.  Anyone who remembers those Easter Sunday airings of The Ten Commandments knows that the Jews are not into idols be they solid gold cows or solid gold Nebuchanezzers.  So why would someone advise you to do something that they themselves would not do?

Because you lack the moral compass to sniff out bad advice when you lacked the moral compass to not invade and enslave an entire tribe and expected them to serve you wholeheartedly.

The second king was some kind of useless despot whose lack of hygiene prompted disrespect for the sacred gold goblets in the Jewish house of worship.  Is this a true story or just an allegory told to the final king about respecting someone else's religion?

These events may have actually occurred but probably by the time the first king built that expensive demonstration of his own ego and intellect, it would be a good idea to let the Jews go home.

I don't think the Fugu Plan was well-received when it was broached.",1396396800,,1904,4.627976190476191

All of them seemed to want to take a fair amount of literary license with the stories they portrayed.  But now we have a new group of people who are making something different.  I have seen three of them so far.  This one, The Book of Ruth, and God's Not Dead, all great.  This one only uses a framework of Daniel telling the story to Cyrus in the sense of anything that isn't in the Bible.  If you are looking to see whether presenting a Bible story without a lot of literary license will work, this is the one to start off with.

This film gives an accurate chronological overview of the entire period and government of four kings and two mighty empires under which Daniel was a true and trustworthy consultant. We can only hope that this film will soon be translated into German!",1393545600,2,994,5.173913043478261

The message in this movie was very clear, and not as confusing as when you first read it in the Bible.  I loved the fact that I was able to explain to my oldest grandchild about dream predictions and interpretations, and  how since back in those days it was happening, how people like Daniel was given this gifts by God  but it wasn't condemn to have an practice this gifts as it is now in this days.  Is a powerful Biblical story with a clear sublime message... Thank you!",1393286400,4,554,4.330097087378641

2319133,4,B0009TIAI6,"I knew going into this it was not going to be a big budget MGM biblical epic and they did not disappoint.  MGM has never been known for their biblical accuracy so I did expect Pure Flix to get it right and they did. For a small budget film they really put together a fine little picture. Since the budget for sets was obviously not available the director and crew used mostly closeups which worked out very well. The script was pretty good and most of the actors did a fine job. The makeup was lacking more then any other technical aspect.  Except for one non-bloody sword thrust and mature subject matter the movie is PG. My five year old watched it with no problem but my eight year old ran out of the room before the firey furnace scene started. (Kids are a trip)

The visual experience, the script, the performances, and the historical background to the the biblical narrative highlight the best of what Daniel and his friends' life & trials in Babylon were about as well as God's purposes through it all. It could have been named, ""The Tale of Four Kings""... I was excited about the fact that each of he kings' spiritual journeys were detailed in a way that reveals how God weighs the hearts of kings and even cares for them. God wants kings to seek justice, to walk humbly before Him, and to know Him and understand His purposes especially concerning the Jews and their return to worship Him in their own land. I was especially surprised that Cyrus' youth was even covered as well as his special role in the Return from exile prophecies.

This misguided (and disobedient!) refusal to use the Name YAHWEH has commanded of His people, is sinful.  It is saying that man knows better than YAHWEH and using the generic ""God"" in place of His actual Name, the Name He revealed to Moses in Exodus and which He told Moses He willed to be known by!  Take your own name as an example.  Do you want people to call you by your name or by the generic, ""man"" or ""woman?""  When this form is sometimes used, it is used as a universal application and not as a unique, never-to-be repeated personal name.  Do you know what your name means?  If you don't, find out!

If you are going to take on Biblical stories, then DO them justice and don't skimp, and don't even bother if you can't make them accurately. The scene where Nebuchadnezzer is crawling around as a ""wild beast"" eating dead weeds, was embarrassing.

2319168,1,B0009TIAI6,Historically inaccurate.  Daniel would not be wondering in the desert.  Daniel was a magoi. A magoi was from Persia and would be traveling with a calvary of 100 men or more.  Daniel would have selected kings in Persia.  To have him wondering in the desert is a downgrade to his character.  Even worse to wonder into a defeated enemies camp.  Historically this is a way to deceive folks thru entertainment to not find truth.  A money maker movie as many are.  Be careful what you watch and follow.  The path of this film is away from Biblical truth.  Daniel is a magoi of Persia.  I recomend you study this history to understand.  Dr. Duane Spencer wrote a book about Christmas and it goes thru this and the wise men (one of them is Daniel) that visited the messiah at birth.  They traveled on horses not camels.  They were a crack calvary team and know all about horses and battle on horseback.,1386633600,3,894,4.472049689440993

2319179,5,B0009TIAI6,"Pretty close to the Bible account with a few exceptions. The books of Daniel or Isaiah don't hint that Daniel personally influenced Cyrus as the movie portrays, but only that his prayer in Dan 9 apparently moved God on behalf of the Jews to return to Judah and Jerusalem, which Cyrus instigated. The lions' den was great with real-looking lions, though the opening of the den was apparently on the top with a stone lid and not through a door on the floor level, which the lions could have lunged out of when opened. The movie didn't show the wives and children of the men (who deceived the king against Daniel) being thrown into the den as in Daniel 6. Perhaps that would have been too sickening to watch. I wish the scene of the three friends of Daniel in the furnace could have shown them walking around and the ""fourth Man"" walking with them, as in Daniel 3. That scene could have been greatly improved, even with the low budget. Also they could have shown Nebuchadnezzar falling prostrate on the floor before Daniel when Daniel interpreted his first dream, as in ch 2. Why not tell it like it is? That wouldn't have cost a penny more. Not enough drama! But still it is was far closer to the biblical account than the Hollywood movies on Abraham, Joseph, Moses, and David. Even ""One Night with the King"" has strayed too far from the true account.",1384560000,4,1349,4.487804878048781

Please understand though, and I hope that the Almighty will remove any falsehood from what will be written here now: Hands down, my favorite book of the Old Testament is Daniel. This movie presents him reasonably well... but the acting is forced, amateurish, and unrealistic as relates to the way people genuinely interact in real life. This presentation was purchased after reading so many glowing reviews (many of which are actually just short opinions) and I honestly could not get through the whole thing, the smug insincerity of the acting was clearly discerned. Once again I'm feeling baited by enthusiastic reviews that are not reflecting some people's highest truth. Some of the reviewing is genuine though much is not. Bilking Christians out of their money has a long history, and there are a lot of people needing to empty themselves of themselves to be able to accurately hear the things that the Lord God Creator Almighty is whispering to their hearts in circumstances like this. While this review may upset some, please also understand: Will speak truth through love, even if it leads to my death.
