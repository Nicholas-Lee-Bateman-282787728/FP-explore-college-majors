3528411,5,B001DDBD40,"""The Way West"" with Kirk Douglas, Robert MItchum and Richard Widmark is about families heading toward a new future.  Kirk Douglas is the leader of this wagon train and Robert Mitchum is the scout who is going blind and trying to hide that fact.  Richard Widmark and his wife and son are a family in the wagon train.  There are perils that they encounter and must overcome.  Some of them they come through without harm and some cost lives.  It is an interesting film that shows the different personalities of these men and how they handle the stress of traveling by wagon train. I would rate this film with *****.
""The Bravados"" stars Gregory Peck as a man on a mission to get the men who killed his wife.  He leaves behind his young daughter to hunt down these men.  In his travels he comes across a woman from his past played by a young Joan Collins. She tries to talk him out of this hunt for the men, but he will not be talked out of his mission to find these men.  Each time he finds a man he loses a part of himself in killing them.  It is an excellent film in showing the sins of men and then their fight for redemption. I would rate this film with *****.
""Broken Arrow"" stars Jimmy Stewart is in a typical Army against Indian film.  A tribe of Indians is interfering with mail service and the Army is ordered to move this tribe to a new location.  Jimmy Stewart is in charge of the detail to move this tribe.  While visiting with them he tries a different tactic and wants peace.  If they agree to leave the mail service alone they can stay where they are.  While in their camp he meets and falls in love with an Indian maiden played by Debra Paget.  The peace does not last long and Jimmy Stewart must take sides. I would rate this film with ***.
Over all this is an excellent 3 film collection to add to your film library.  GLS",1377907200,,1836,4.217765042979942

3528415,4,B001DDBD40,"First off - all 4 are public domain films - if you require state of the art prints, for a couple of dollars, wise up! Not gonna get it here or anywhere on this planet. I paid under a dollar for this 4 pac and got so much more than I expected. All the prints are perfectly acceptable. But the movies themselves - well, that's where I made out like a thief!

It's been quite a few years since the last time I saw ""The Outlaw."" I never cared for it much, but this time I suspect it must have been intended as a farce - one as outdated and ultimately irrelevant as the over-hyped sex and violence this film was supposed to deliver. I wonder how many people it actually shocked at the time of it's release? Even the great actors turn in feeble performances. I recall reading that the film's big attraction, Jane Russell, realized and admitted she had no talent. That's the coolest thing about this movie. Undoubtedly, the most famous in this collection, but far from the best.

""The Deadly Companions"" is one I'd never heard of before and what a pleasant surprise! The story may not be the most original, and it's very predictable, but it doesn't feel like a retread. And the performances are all very good. I knew just about nothing about Brian Keith's career, aside from his astonishingly boring sitcom of the late 60's, ""Family Affair,"" and I knew nothing about his actual talent as an actor. However, I can hardly imagine anyone turning in a better performance of a man whose true nature emerges when it really matters, except maybe Humphrey Bogart, who excelled at this kind of role. Maureen O'hara might have been miscast for her roll as the jaded widow, but it doesn't take long before she makes her character real. The rest of the cast is excellent.  This an early Sam Peckinpah movie and although there's no splattering blood, all the characters have that rough rawness you'd expect from him.

""Kansas Pacific"" may be most notable for being a story that takes place between the southern state's succession from the Union, but before war broke out. The tension in that situation alone leads to me to believe this could have been a much more exciting film, but instead, it's just a good action western. There's also something amiss with the characters. I kept wondering why they were behaving the way they do. This is the kind of movie I like to fall asleep to, when I need a little help - not bad, but not engaging enough to keep me awake. I value films like this.

Then, last but not least, ""One-Eyed Jacks."" Wow!!! How I made it to fifty something without seeing this one before, I'll never know. Maybe because it was the first and last time Brando directed, leading me to suspect that directing wasn't his forte, combined with it being a public domain movie. I know, there are several great public domain films, but thousands of truly awful ones. So I wrote it off. It's so cool to discover such a treasure, so many decades after I thought I'd seen all the great ones. However, that makes it so much sadder that he never directed again. Story, acting, cinematography, directing...all great! I especially enjoyed the stylized, casual delivery of the dialogue. Maybe Brando's style is old school by now, but it's still way cool.

The One-Eyed Jacks deserves 5 stars, but I can't give the whole collection the full 5. Even if you pay list price for this collection, I think you'll get more than your money's worth.",1315612800,4,3417,4.566068515497553
3528416,2,B001DDBD40,"I read The Way West 60 years ago and loved it. Then I saw the movie that is included in this packet. I did not remember it as it was shown. I then re-read the book. The movie hardly follows the book at all and in fact changes it to the point that it becomes absurd. Starting from the beginning, the scout did not have his Indian wife die, it was his sickened white wife and in the book she had JUST died. Second, the man who killed the Indian did not shoot him with a shotgun in the bushes but with a rifle while the Indian was sitting in a tree. Third, the Indians did come to ask for some sort of compensation for the shooting but they were refused anything and were sent away. Therefore, there was no hanging of the man or any killing of the leader in retaliation. Fourth, the leader was never about to be hanged as portrayed in the movie. Fifth, the leader was replaced alright but he did not continue all the way with the wagon train. He split off with a few others and went to California. Since that is true he could not have been with them when, according to the movie, he was killed by the avenging wife. Sixth, what scout who knows his way around the area would lead the wagon train to a sheer cliff? That is truly absurd. That did not happen and as a result the train was not lowered to the bottom of the cliff as shown in the movie. Even that was absurd. The wagons were lowered with their sides against the cliff face. There was no ramp to allow the wagons to ride over the edge to be lowered. They would have had to swing out and their momentum would bring them crashing to the side or swinging back and forward violently with poor result. Apparently, the movie makers thought they had to make the movie more exciting than the book. The book was already a best seller and did not need improvement and the movie's improvement was stupid at best. Otherwise, change the name of the movie and don't claim it is a retelling of the book by A.B.Guthrie, Jr.
Broken Arrow was actually quite well done and is based on a true story. Some changes were made but basically it follows the truth fairly well and is the first movie that gave a reasonable picture of the Indians. I did not watch The Bravados.",1282262400,5,2205,4.215130023640662
3528417,4,B001DDBD40,"Westerns were the procedurals of their day, so there is a wealth of great guest stars in the episodes on this DVD. My favorite here is the very British J. Pat O'Malley's earnest attempt at a silver prospector's accent on an episode of Shotgun Slade.

One of many fun things about watching dollar DVDs is finding ""hidden"" episodes. The back of the DVD lists the second-to-last entry as being an episode of Judge Roy Bean, but in actuality it is a second episode of Bonanza. A good one, too. Here's a full listing of the 9 episodes on this DVD:

Bonanza - ""Day of Reckoning""
The Lone Ranger - ""The Masked Rider""
The Rifleman - ""Day of the Hunter""
Shotgun Slade - ""Skinner's Rainbow""
Annie Oakley - ""A Tall Tale""
The Adventures of Jim Bowie - ""Birth of the Blade""
The Deputy - ""Hard Decision""

8292822,5,B001DDBD40,"Of the three films in this set I have only watched the Bravados so far and it is so great that it's worth buying the other two regardless of how good or bad they are.  It is one of the most sophisticated westerns I have ever seen.  It is full of heavy themes, symbolism, psychological overtones and is beautifully filmed and crafted by the great but underrated director Henry King.  Gregory Peck is perfect for the role of an obsessed man on an existential quest for revenge.  Peck just has that larger than life persona and you feel like you are watching a Greek God from the myths of old coming down to earth to unleash a horrible wrath across the western landscape. The very concept or theme of evil is so important to the essence of this movie that it becomes a character unto itself as if it were playing a role along side the other actors. Evil becomes a dark shadow moving quietly in the background that can take possession of any man like a virus that infects the soul.  When Peck comes to town to watch the hanging of four criminals he suspects of having murdered his wife, he too is treated like a criminal by the town folks.  There is fear that someone may come to free the criminals therefore the town tries to quarantine itself from the evil that abounds the landscape and any stranger who arrives is considered an unknown quantity. The town becomes that safe oasis man needed to build to establish his ideals and to denounce his baser instincts.  We see all the elements in the town that have cultivated and elevated civilization.  There is law and order which can separate the good from the bad and then pass judgement to rid itself of the latter; there is community which creates a safe environment in which folks can know and trust one another; there is the church which allows a man to define his moral self and purge the evil in his soul; and finally the town is the place where a man takes a woman by hand, weds her and they become family. There are clues in the film that bear this logic out.  After Peck comes to town and just barely averts trouble with the locals who are suspicious of him, he makes contact with Joan Collins' character who is an old acquaintance of his.  She invites him to church but he declines which indicates that he can not go because his soul is in the wrong place - he's been riding alone too long in the dark and forbidden landscapes. The criminals do make their escape with the help of an outside accomplice oddly enough played by Joe DeRita who became Curly Joe's replacement in The Three Stooges. Derita comes to town posing as the executioner after killing the actual one and leaving his body outside town.  This furthers the idea that no man can be trusted because evil is so hard to detect and so transient inside the human soul.  When the convicts are on the run they too have a need to establish trust with one another.  Two of the convicts pair off together admitting their distrust of the other two and a preference for each other.  They make a bond to watch each others backs but the relationship does not last because these men are too far beyond the ideals that only civilized society can establish.

The climax of the film is powerful and beautifully brings resolution to all the story elements presented throughout the film.  When the criminals escape into Mexico the posse following them stops the pursuit declaring they have no legal authority to cross the border.  But Peck declares that he does and boldly rides alone across the river separating the two regions.  We see Peck as a man outside the laws of man and God who has more in common with the criminals than the posse and that's why he can ride on.  In Mexico he is finally forced to face his own demons and is made to realize that there is more to the truth of his wife's murder than he realized. His convictions are compromised because he learns that someone he had once trusted is now suspect and the last criminal he pursues, a Mexican Indian, suddenly becomes a more complex and sympathetic individual than Peck would have ever wanted to give him credit for.  The great Henry Silva plays the part of the last man pursued by Peck and the character he plays here is just as complex as the actor himself.

Let me diverge a little here to talk about an actor who has always aroused my curiosity since I was about six years old.  Henry Silva has played everything from Mexicans, Chinese servants, Puerto Ricans and even a part as Jerry Lewis' brother.  He has been cast so often as a non Caucasion that I always assumed that's what he was. After fifty years of curiosity, in fact just after watching this film, I Googled his name and found out that he is an American from Brooklyn, New York and is of Sicilian and Spanish decent!  Also adding to the mystery of this man is that he seemed to be loosely associated with Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack but was never officially recognized as a member.  I say this because he appeared in Ocean's Eleven and in other Frank Sinatra movies. I once watched an interview of Frank Sinatra in which he complains about a scene in the Manchurian Candidate in which Henry Silva playing a Chinese Servant goes overboard with his acting and accidentally hurts Frank.  He doesn't even mention Silva by name but refers to him as some guy like he was just another stunt man on the set. This is strange considering their lifetime association and the fact that Silva was after all a star.  The man has always been and will always be an enigma to me.

Long before Peck catches up with Silva in Mexico we sense that there is something more to the man than his being just one of the gang of criminals. At the beginning of the film Peck asks the town sheriff for a chance to see the prisoners. Peck walks up to each man while they stand behind bars and stares each one of them down except for Silva who just stares back without surrendering his gaze or looking away.  So early in the movie it is hard to know what this means but we know it means something.  After the criminals escape and are being pursued by the posse, Silva is the one who always knows what is going on and how best to elude capture.  There is a women who is taken hostage by the gang and Silva is the only one who shows any sympathy for her even though it is very scant attention he gives her.  The gang is on the run and near starvation because of the hot pursuit.  Stephen Boyd who plays a nasty member of the gang has up to this time been giving much attention to the woman even though it is mostly sexual advances which she completely rejects.  When they finally break into a cabin and find food, Boyd just ignores the woman and stuffs his mouth.  Silva does likewise but he takes the time to throw a loaf of bread at the women which she acknowledges with an appreciative glance.  We now see this man as both good and bad simultaneously which fits the theme of this movie very well.

I apologize for giving so much of the plot away and will not describe the final scene other than to say that this is when hero and outlaw have their rendezvous with fate. Silva's character continues to develop and take on meaning as a multidimensional man who is not that different from Peck's character.  Peck comes to realize the complexities of events that had evaded him and derailed his efforts from the start - in other words there is a plot twist that I won't give away.  But Peck learns that no man can become a vigilante force on his own because life is too complex and the souls of men are too difficult to discern.  Men are both good and evil at the same time but the bad might not be at the core of a man. This is the case for both Peck and Silva but it is a situation that creates confusion and does not allow them to live within God's moral design. Peck ultimately realizes this and goes back to the town which is where a man belongs with the community of others to develop and grow and become a moral force for the good of himself and all human kind.",1412640000,2,7965,4.366283006093433
