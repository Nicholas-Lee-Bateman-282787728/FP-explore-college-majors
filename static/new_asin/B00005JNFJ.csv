7940321,5,B00005JNFJ,"I cannot imagine why this has not been released to dvd.

Michael Moore has been exposing corporate America as a rather reclusive ""person"" for many years, and everything he's done on tv ought to be released on dvd.  Indeed. I recommend the apotheosis of Michael Moore... America's proudest son documentarian.  Why leave it to Cannes to honor him?  ....Oh ya, I forgot, France is persona non gratia.

In the same vein, may I recommend Thom Hartmann's ""We The People:  A Call to Take Back America""?",1182988800,6,495,4.764705882352941
7940322,5,B00005JNFJ,TV Nation was a terrifiic show.  It built on the stuff that Moore did in Roger and Me.  It was very funny and made a great point.  The couple of shows on VHS does not do justice to the entire run of the show.  Put this out on DVD!,1166486400,10,230,3.63265306122449
