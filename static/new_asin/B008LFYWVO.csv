5424095,4,B008LFYWVO,"I found this four pack at a local department store. Two things drew me to it... ""SHALLOW GROUND"" is a very cool and unique movie, and also I am a sucker for horror sets (and this brand/distributor has released four, 4-horror film sets)

Now for the BONUS that I mentioned in my title!

There is a fifth movie in this set (at least, mine has 5) called:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rage-Unrated-Director-s-Cut/dp/B0010YVCC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rage (Unrated Director's Cut)</a>&nbsp;! This was an unexpected treat, even more since I had THE RAGE on one of my (to check out) wish lists! It is another cool movie, making this set worth picking up! Contrary to the product description above, this is a TWO disc set! The bonus title is located on disc 1 side 2, along with Shallow Ground.

SHALLOW GROUND is the best of the set, followed by the bonus title THE RAGE

As for the other titles: SEVERED was a adequate watch, and between EVIL REMAINS / GONE DARK, only one was decent at best. I apologize for not recalling the bad! But at least I've narrowed it down to, one of the titles on the right half of the cover.

Bottom Line: 2 cool titles / 2 average titles / 1 stinker = A good deal! Especially when you consider, at first glance it may appear to be only 4 average-to-below average titles!

-Lastly, the other three Horror Fest 4-packs do not contain a bonus movie. This is the only set with a BONUS, from this distributor! (again, at least in the sets I own)",1373587200,,1522,4.812260536398467
5424096,3,B008LFYWVO,B rated movies in my opinion. It was cheap thats the best thing I can say about it. My husband found Poker Run to be a bit interesting but I thought it was lame. Personally I have seen much better and will think twice before buying any more of the so called Horror Pack Dvd's.,1345075200,2,276,4.036363636363636
