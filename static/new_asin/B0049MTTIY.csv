However, he loves to sit and listen to great music from singers of long ago.  This is the best purchase I have ever made!!!  This is Dad's absolute favorite DVD ~ He watches it every single day.  It makes him so happy, and brings about a calmness to him that I can't describe.  He repeatedly says what a beautiful voice Andy Williams 'has'. (He doesn't understand that Andy Williams is no longer with us.).  He has asked me yesterday to tell the people that know Andy and had anything to do with this DVD, that it is really great, and that he really loves it.  He made me promise!  And I did.  I have watched this with him many, many times, and I hope to be watching it with him for many, many more times to come.  It has become my favorite DVD, too.",1496275200,2,869,4.113095238095238

8419143,5,B0049MTTIY,"This DVD more then met my expectations.  I love it and have watched it numerous times since receiving it.

I grew up watching Andy Williams on his TV series and at one time had all of his albums.  On this DVD I especially loved the song ""Love Story"".  Besides Andy's great singing of this song, he looks fabulous in the white suit.  Not many can pull off wearing a white suit, but Andy sure did.  When he sang ""Abraham, Martin and John"" it brought tears to my eyes.  The song after that is ""Without A Song"" and you can tell that Andy is having a fun time with this song.

If you love to hear and see Andy Williams perform, this is the DVD for you.  You won't be sorry.",1392681600,,668,4.076923076923077
