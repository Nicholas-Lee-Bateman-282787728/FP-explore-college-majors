I watched this movie many times growing up, and have been hunting for a DVD version fo years, in different countries.
I finally found this version. What a shame! The print gives you the feeling of trying to discern what is going on through a foggy window. I hope Fox Films see the light and release a remastered, clean copy. There are so many third rate movies constantly being released, in state of the art reconstruction, when it comes to such an iconic movie, should be a no-brainer.
In the meantime, since the only alternative is a VHS copy, I will hold on to my foggy copy.",1380240000,2,697,4.32824427480916
