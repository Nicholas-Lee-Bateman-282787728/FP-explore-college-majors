2457405,1,B000CCW180,"Unfortunately there are lots of people and companies who like to make easy money... It seems the case with the producers of this DVD. The images and sound are horrible!! And I know there is enough technolgy today to enhance both... But that costs money and the producers of such DVD don't seem to be the type of people who would be interested in such expenditures... Even in respect of the Beatles fans throughout the world.
I am a Beatlemaniac and I thing all we can watch or listen from the group is great but that doesn't mean that people can throw garbage on our faces to make easy money.",1077321600,,592,4.390909090909091

2457410,4,B000CCW180,"Judge Jim Stewart, DVD Verdict -- ""Where does Frank Sinatra go in Frank Sinatra: Around the World? Los Angeles, New York, London, and Japan. The four concerts span 1970 to 1985. The accompanying booklet suggests that only two--Ol' Blue Eyes is Back and Sinatra: The Main Event--have been screened on U.S. television, so there's something new here even for longtime fans. Sinatra doesn't sing exactly the same playlist each time, but you'd better like ""My Kind of Town,"" ""The Lady is a Tramp,"" and ""I Get a Kick Out of You,"" since he does them a lot. Fortunately, he does variations each time, once even mentioning Yokohama in ""My Kind of Town"" (he switches back to Chicago by the end, though). You'll notice, if you watch these in a marathon session, that he tries to make things fresh each time out, changing moods or tempos so that a classic is something new for a live performance. Two concerts make this set the one to choose. Ol' Blue Eyes is Back is more intimate than the others in the collection, and it provides a career retrospective, starting with older songs like ""I Get a Kick Out of You,"" moving into his mid-career wistfulness with mature songs like ""Last Night When We Were Young,"" and sampling his then-new album with ""Let Me Try Again"" and ""Send in the Clowns."" He jokes around a lot about his advanced age, especially in ""We Can't Do That Anymore,"" a duet with Gene Kelly, who still has a few tap moves. The lighting and occasional sets aid that sense of intimacy; the studio is often darkened to make it feel like he's alone. Sinatra in Japan collects a lot of favorites in one place, including his first hit, ""All or Nothing at All,"" and his favorite song, ""Come Rain or Come Shine."" The accompanying booklet tells me that it's a rarity that collectors have been trying to find for years. If you could only see one Sinatra concert on DVD in your life, either one of these would be a good choice, and they're here together. Picture quality is good for video, with the occasional ripple or other flaw. Sound quality is good, if unspectacular. A booklet provides playlists and background on the concerts.""",1310515200,23,2123,4.619047619047619
2457411,1,B000CCW180,"If you are The Beatles fun, spend more money and get All three programs all as separate disks.

(I was simply shocked to see the quality of Budokan...)

After all, it is a Chinese copy from Thailand DVD of the Malaysian VHS bootleg from Korea, recorded by 16 mm camera from the TV screen; and soon to be transferred to Blu-Ray.",1215820800,,327,4.344262295081967
2457412,5,B000CCW180,"As it contains the entire Washington Coloseum concert and a rare TV-special with a incredible Beatles-performance (maybe the best Live-performance I've ever seen from the Beatles), this DVD is a masterpiece. Don't miss it!!",1194134400,,223,5.588235294117647
2457413,4,B000CCW180,"This DVD has the entire Washington Coloseum concert from Feb. 11th 1964. The first time I was actually able to see the whole thing. Very nice except that the picture quality is not too good(it looks like someone's old home movie),especially when compared to other videos like Beatles Unauthorised,Fun With the Fab Four,Ed Sullivan Presents the Beatles, and the Beatles Anthology. However,with the exception of Ed Sullivan presents..., these don't show complete concert footage like this one. So I guess you get a little of this and a little of that. You also get the entire and I mean entire,uncut concert at the Budokan Hall in Japan in 1966. Lovely, but again the picture quality is not good. Although it's in color, there is a blue tint to it. Compare this to Anthology which shows the Japan concert  beautifully restored. But of course Anthology doesn't show the whole concert. Again, a little of this a little of that. You also are treated to the entire uncut Around the Beatles tv special that aired in April of 1964. It features all of the acts that appeared with the boys plus the Beatles own concert,the audio of which you may be familiar with from the Anthology 1 CD. Here,you get to see as well as hear. It also features their Shakespear sketch which was very amusing and the picture quality on this is much better. The other acts,except for maybe Cilla Black, are really awful. Makes you realize why The Beatles were such a breath of fresh air in 1964. You'll breathe a sigh of relief when they come on, because they actually had talent. For that matter they're a breath of fresh air nowadays too. The Shakespear sketch is also on Beatles Unauthorised/Fun with the Fab Four,but on this Beatles Around the World, you get the entire show including their concert,like I already said. This is a nice DVD to own and it's very cheap. You really can't find uncut concert footage like this, anywhere so it's worth the less than wonderful picture quality. And the sound quality is just fine throughout. And the Around the Beatles footage is really nice to own even if the other acts were disappointing. Who cares about them anyway? The Beatles don't seem to let on how awful they were. They are seen clapping and cheering throughout. No wonder they were so well liked by everyone in show business. They never gave the impression that they thought they were better than these people, even though it is so obvious that they were worlds apart in talent. They were humble,and professional,and approachable. I'm sure they knew they were special, but they never flaunted it. I think everyone felt special for having known them. No one begrudged them their success, because they were such nice kids. You really see that on these videos. The only reason this DVD gets 4 stars is the iffy picture quality,but the content is worth 5 stars.",1178841600,8,2832,4.721212121212122
2457414,2,B000CCW180,"It's good that this Beatles footage is available, because all Beatles footage should be. But, as the packaging aptly warns us, the film quality and sound is pretty bad. In the case of an episonde of the British Television show ""Around the Beatles"" from 1964, this is only to be expected. However, in the case of concert footage from Japan in 1966, this is a disappointment, because we know for a fact that clearer visual footage of these shows exists, some of which you can see in the wonderful ""Beatles Anthology."" Anyway, the ""Around the Beatles"" episode is a curiosity in that it shows that not everything the Beatles did was timeless. This is definitely from another age, when TV shows were pretty rinky dink. It opens with an abysmal skit in which the Beatles are obliged to enact a thrown-together comic version of the old English tale Pyramis and Thysbie, complete with costumes, in front of an audience of hooting teens who mostly just want to see the boys play music. The whole thing calls to mind John Lennon's later tart quote, along the lines that one had to completely humiliate oneself to succeed. Here are the Beatles playing the game, reading corny comic lines by some hack, not yet realizing they didn't have to do this nonsense because they were already successful. But anyway, it's a time piece. The Washington D.C. footage highlights the chaos of the groups' 1964 tour, but again, I swear I've seen better footage of this same event elsewhere. Ditto the Japan footage, though be it noted that you are never likely to find any Beatles concert footage that has really good sound quality, given the limits of the technology in those days. (The exception is footage of Shea Stadium (see its own dvd) for which the Beatles redubbed sound themselves in a Londons studio in early 1966.) So, this one is for hardcore completists only. Most fans would be content to own ""The Beatles Anthology"" instead.",1126137600,4,1913,4.747747747747748

8097583,5,B000CCW180,"""Music as Medicine"" I purchased this DVD as test.  My mother is living in a nursing home with many other Alzheimers patients and they would spend a good bit of their day sitting in a community family room with a television playing various programs.  The patients showed little if any recognition of the programming being broadcast but I noticed that there was also a DVD player attached to the television.  I took the DVD in and had the staff put it on for the patients and surprisingly, most of them reacted almost immediately.  You could see fingers and toes tapping throughout the room.  This great music stirred memories in them that we all had thought were lost forever.",1411344000,9,675,4.686440677966102
