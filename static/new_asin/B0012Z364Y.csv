8248416,2,B0012Z364Y,This movie was not very entertaining.  Had nothing to do with the legend of the 'Llorona'.  Too bad I already bought.  I just trashed it.,1423440000,,137,4.4
8248417,2,B0012Z364Y,This is another of a half dozen or so poorly acted poorly scripted La Llorona film about the legend of the demon that causes women to drown their own children. The production couldn't hold my interest 3 minutes into the film. They used typical horror piano music and what was that fakey looking red-eye make-up? Horror fans will be bored to tears.,1333324800,,347,4.612903225806452
8248418,3,B0012Z364Y,"I grew up with the story of ""La Llorona"" and I had to get this movie if only to relive those memories of sitting with my cousins in Mexico in a darkened room while aunts and uncles would tell us stories of this ""wailing woman""! It was fun!",1257292800,,239,4.0
8248419,1,B0012Z364Y,"and it had a creepy premise, but that was about it.  I wanted this movie to be more than it was (um, I guess I want that of most things I watch), something along the line of Japanese Scary Atmospheric Horror, but it fell flat and never got better.  It failed on almost all levels, but the music was truly haunting and got under my skin - I just wish the movie tried as hard.  The filmmakers will luck out a bit on this one since people will look at the cover and give it a chance, albeit an undeserved one.",1255651200,,506,3.99009900990099
8248420,3,B0012Z364Y,"I used this movie in conjuction with an adult education lesson plan on myths and legends. The movie could not be considered a ""good"" movie but was effective for an end to an interesting topic.",1231804800,,192,4.514285714285714
8248421,1,B0012Z364Y,"I think the director must've cried during post production when he saw how bad his movie really was. However, to be fair, I think the actors went out of their way in this film, which is the only reason why I didn't stop the movie halfway through. I kept thinking it was going to get better but it only got progressively worse.

The big disappointment for me was the fact that they never showed what this crying woman looked like. You see what she sees through her eyes, sort of like how Laura Mars saw what the killer was seeing in The Eyes of Laura Mars.

Bottom line: don't waste your time or your money. That means don't rent it or buy it. Seriously.",1220313600,,652,4.25
8248422,2,B0012Z364Y,"""The Cry"" has an interesting story, a 500 year old legend about a child-killing demon, but the director does nothing to draw in the viewer. This film is boring, boring, boring. The cinematography is grainy and the story is told in the same murky manner.

There are better horror movies out there.",1217980800,,296,4.6923076923076925
8248423,3,B0012Z364Y,"I found the last scene hokey and stupid (what La Llorona says). I wound up saying ""Oh, come ON!"" out loud. And the curandera's decision, though foreshadowed earlier on, annoyed me. I wanted a conquering heroine.
The film itself isn't bad for a first-time indy filmmaker. But I didn't realize that the original drowning was what those flashes were. There were too many flashes to keep track of for me.
To those who don't like it, please don't sell this film short -- remember that it is is a first film. And thank you, Bernadine for NOT making it a slasher film! Although part of me wishes there had been a segment on how La Llorona got to NYC, the truth is, the legend exists anywhere there are hispanics, so I guess it doesn't matter. But I would have enjoyed it more if it hadn't seemed so much like I was walking into the middle of a story with no beginning or end.
I guess didn't like it much, because I wanted something a bit more -- well, more. But I really did like the extras (the legends, modern youth telling how they remember La Llorona, and a director's short). And I wouldn't mind having this in my library.
I was living in New Mexico, just north of El Paso, Texas when I first heard the story of La Llorona (in the 80s). It was a vague story, and I wanted to know more. That's why I rented this movie. I'm not sorry I did. If this is a first film, and the director does films about what she loves, she's going to be great. I think I'd like to see a series of La Llorona films, and see how she develops using the same theme. Not a series like Freddy Krueger Part XXVII or anything. Just remake the same film with a different vantage point or a bit more plot or character development. That would be interesting to me but probably dull to everyone else. Well, I like Brussels Sprouts and not everyone else does, so to each his own.",1217203200,,1842,4.250712250712251
8248424,1,B0012Z364Y,"Ugh.

There's hardly any plot at all.  The movie moves at a snail's pace, though watching a snail would be a heck of a lot more entertaining.  The characters don't act in any way that's realistic.  There's really no point to watching this movie.  It almost got two stars for the little bit of Spanish practice I got, but for using a sound effect from Star Wars (twice!!), I would give it 0 or less if I could.  Please, please watch something else.",1212969600,,447,4.325301204819277
8248425,4,B0012Z364Y,"I really hadn't heard much about ""The Cry"" when I watched an advance copy of the film, but it was definitely better than I expected, with a good story line (the legend of La Llorona). Some scary scenes, but nothing graphic. A good evening's entertainment!",1212192000,,255,4.688888888888889
