Now,ten years later,he has a dead end job and his marriage is on the rocks. He wonders if God is interested in the mess he's made of his life. He gets his answer when he is reunited with his uncle and former trainer,Billy Jack Taylor(played superbly by Kevin Sorbo). Jake discovers that Billy Jack has given his life to Christ and is a changed person. Jake rededicates his life to the Lord and decides to fight for the most important thing in his life-his family,despite the interference of his meddling mother-in-law. This is a movie that all families should watch together and discuss afterwards. I wholteheartedly recommend it!",1434758400,7,754,4.852713178294573

8705322,5,B00UC3ONBC,"This movie aired on Tv's Movie of the Week recently. After watching it, I believe that many can associate with dealing with life when things just don't go the way you think they ought to fo. Especially when you have a mother-in-law that makes all efforts to break up her daughter's marriage to what she considers him as a complete failure. Jake Taylor (played by Tommy Lee Thomas), struggles after having left the ring, to make a return to the life he gave up. But God has His own plans for Jake and for his family, whom he loves dearly.
This is an uplifting movie to watch as you see God's plans unfold, even when no one thinks they will.
Labor Day Weekend is coming up. Use that time off to get this movie and watch it. I believe you will be greatly blessed by, ""One More Round.""",1441152000,3,781,4.283783783783784

8705324,5,B00UC3ONBC,It was obvious to me that this movie was inspired by the Lord.  I found it most interesting from beginning to end.  I have watched it a few times now and each time was blessed.  I highly recommend this movie.  It is not just about boxing but about life.  I noticed it was given the Dove Foundation Seal of Approval and I could sure see why.  I think every Christian who watches this movie will be blessed.  It has also touched lives of non-believers as well.  I am aware that it was not a high-budget movie but I was focusing more on its message and was happy I was not disappointed.,1439769600,,583,4.1891891891891895

8705326,1,B00UC3ONBC,I was very disappointed in this movie. The storyline and most of the actors were just not good. However I greatly appreciate those who choose to advance the message of Christ.,1437523200,3,175,4.67741935483871
8705327,2,B00UC3ONBC,"I purchased this movie because I like boxing and because it starred Franco Columbu as a trainer. I followed Franco Columbu as a competitive bodybuilder in the 1960's and 1970's. Unfortunately, this is not a boxing movie. Boxing is only a prop in a very weak story line. The acting is mediocre and the story is a boring account of a man's struggle to set his life back on a successful path. The movie has a quasi religious undertone that I found very condescending and irrelevant. Franco Columbu does his best with a very weak script. I do not understand why he chose to be involved with this movie, he can do better. I do not recommend this movie, save your money. There are much better boxing movies available.",1437004800,3,711,4.51937984496124
