7820874,4,6302036690,"While not a masterpiece, this is also far from the mess most critics took it for. An intelligent failure (or modest success), Bergman looks at Germany in the 20s as laying the groundwork for Hitler and the Nazis.

Liv Ullman is terrific, as always. And if David Carradine is only good, not great, he certainly didn't deserve the critical attacks he received. The nature of his character is a man so locked in passivity as to be enigmatic. You might not like that kind of character, but it's certainly not the actor's fault for carrying it out well.

Yes, some of it is slow, and some a bit obvious, but those charges could also be leveled against some Bergman films labeled masterpieces.

As a cautionary tale of where we were once before, and could end up again, I've certainly seen far worse. It has some truly chilling moments. And I think seeing it again may reveal even more...",1454198400,,882,4.569620253164557
7820875,3,6302036690,"As a film about Hitler's rise to power and pre WWII Berlin, this film is much the failure.  There is a pervasive unease which permeates the air, but it's as much an existential angst aborted from the belly of commerce/captialism as anything else.  Viewed as an expressionist nightmare where poverty, brutality, capitalism, depravity run the human spirit into the ground, the film is quite powerful.  It takes a second viewing to appreciate Carradine's performance.  Liv Ullman is very good, as you'd expect her to be in a Bergman film.  Ultimately, the film suffers from an inability to focus as well as too much money being spent on the sets (which are nice btw)instead of the real issues at hand.  I'd recommend this film to Bergman enthusists...others might ask ""what's the point?"".",1059609600,,785,4.9541984732824424
