7885732,3,630518500X,"O.K., While it's no Visitors from space or even as good as His second trilogy: UFO's and the paranormal. It's still well filmed atmospheric and entertaining (Juhan Af Grann Director seems to have a lot of fun camping it up) but it looses out in credibility of the witness ( Who seem even more loopy) and above all the music which is in no way as good as his earlier films, Visitors from Space has the best music of any documentary period. Worth a watch but don't expect too much.",1406592000,,479,4.333333333333333
7885733,1,630518500X,"Oh were to start, well lets go with this the ""experts"" they brought had conflicting views of Roswell and the apocalypse it was hilarious, I couldn't STOP laughing especially when they brought out Ed Dames the clout he should hold in the ufo field is dishwasher. I have to say the best has to be the producer: he was just too funny because he mugged for the camera non stop, if he wasn't fixing his black leather gloves or staring at you with a ""Copperfield esq"" stare he was galavanting around in some silk robe, in fact the first time I saw this too much hair gel using, new age freak on screen I had to stop the video because I was laughing so hard. The fact that it was presented in a serious format made me laugh even harder.
Even though all the apocalypse stuff that was suppose to happen didn't, I still look forward to the new apocalypse because even though we'd have to fight through diease,natural disaster, and alien funded goverment thugs I know that goofy producer would just be mugging it up, making the world burning down to embers a little easier on the rest of us.",990230400,,1080,4.378109452736318
