The action is horrible and the story line is even worst, David Chang is casted here but this great martial arts film legend couldn't revieve this mess. Will be giving this one away to someone I don't know and who can't come back at me later.",1167350400,,368,4.125
7989720,5,B000095J6N,"this movie reminded me of the same action in Samurai Jack. The fight scenes, the music, the dialoge, all of it was awsome but i can't figure out if it takes place in Japan, China or whatever oriental country is out there. All in all this was a great film and others should really cheak it out",1069459200,2,292,4.140350877192983
7989721,4,B000095J6N,"This is a great TV series that premiered in mainland China. It follows the wuxia novel of Gu Long in his Lu Xiao Feng series. In particular it covers the third, and most popular, novel about a duel and a plot to take the Imperial throne. The characters in this version are all much younger than in the novels, but do an overall good job. In particular Christopher Lee (not the same one from Lord of the Rings) does a great job as the Shadow Swordsman Ximen. Jimmy Yin does a charming job as Lu Xiao Feng. If you always wanted to watch a soap opera in the orient with lots of fighting and intrigue, this is your DVD.
The actual series is 20 episodes long, about an hour each. This weighs in at a little over three hours, so of course they cut a lot. Personally I would like to find a DVD version of the entire series, but they don't have that, not even one that is just subbed. Nonetheless this is a charming ""movie"" and tells the same story as ""The Duel"". It even has an audio commentary by the same gentlemen, which is good as well.
In conclusion I found this a charming piece, but you can judge for yourself.",1059436800,12,1110,4.191588785046729
