The technical aspect  of the video is an essential part for all karatekas who wish to understand  the finer points of kata as demonstrated by the Masters.",955324800,2,427,5.159420289855072
7889308,5,6305435219,"This video gives an excellent overview of the founding of modern karate.  It traces the common thread shared by the most popular current traditional styles.  It reflects a great deal of research and places today's study of  karate in its proper historical perspective.  The inclusion of kata as  demonstrated by Konishi Sensei is a rare treat.  An equally well-done and  infomative video can be found in the second volume, Ryobu-kai and Shotokan.",955324800,,446,5.111111111111111
