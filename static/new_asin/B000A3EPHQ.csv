2356361,3,B000A3EPHQ,"This is an edited version of the Witching of Ben Wagner.  Several parts mentioning witchcraft and nature have been cut out of this version.  I'm going to be ordering the original version on VHS. Those of you who loved this movie as a child should be aware that this version is edited and should order the copies that specifically say ""Witching"" in the title.",1275609600,10,358,4.578125
2356362,4,B000A3EPHQ,"This is a great, feel good movie about the importance of self-confidence. There are also messages about accepting people and not jumping conclusions about them because they are different. I used to watch it as a kid, and it is still a good movie.

The basic plot: Boy moves to new place. Boy meets girl. Girl is rumored to be a witch, largely becuase she is different than the other kids. Girl and boy become friends and girl gives boy confidence so that he can succeed. He rescues his sister after she falls in the river, becuase he now believes he can do such things. Later girl gets feelings hurt when boy says he thinks she is a witch. He says he is sorry and they make up. Side plots are that boy's dad wants to build a highrise on girl's family's land, and family doesn't want to sell. Boy stands up for his friends to dad. Dad is impressed and has a change of heart and submarines the project. There are also subplots about not doing things just so you fit in and valuing your family. Overall a good movie with good messages that will be easy for kids to understand.

There was one thing that I was disappointed about. The copy that I bought was from a company called ""feature films for families"" which I didn't know ahead of time, as I think I bought it from a book and video resale company. The FFF campany claims to be about promoting traditional values through film and media. Now, I have nothing against promoting such things as tolerance and confidence, but it seems that they made changes that were not neccessary. For example, one line that was originally ""that's how nature planned it"" is now ""that's how god planned it."" And there was one point where Ben says ""if you didn't save her...then witchcraft saved her!!"" to which Regina replies ""YOU saved her."" That entire exchange has been cut. Neither of these are integral to the plot, but I think if I had known that the company did this I would have chosen to simply have our original VHS transfered onto a DVD, to avoid giving such a company my money. I think that treating a whimsical use of ""whitchcraft"" as the vehicle for the characters to be seen as different as something that is going to somehow encourage interest in magic or the occult is sensationalist, over the top, and rediculous. But apparently based on one of the other reviews for this movie this is a concern of some people. Anyway, whether or not people think it's a valid thing to do, it annoyed me. Oh, and they also changed the title. It was originally ""The Witching of Ben Wagner."" Ok, getting off my soapbox. (steps down)

In the end it is a great film and I think it is great for kids to see, and will be super nostalgic for those of you who like me saw it as a kid.",1249948800,13,2708,4.369047619047619
2356363,3,B000A3EPHQ,"I WAS HAPPY WITH THE MESSAGE OF I CAN DO THINGS BUT I DID NOT CARE FOR THE REFERENCES EVEN IF IT WAS A JOKE FOR THE FRIENDS TO PRETEND TO BE WITCHES, I WILL NOT SHARE THIS WITH MY GRANDCHILDREN BECAUSE OF THAT .",1223769600,2,211,3.7111111111111112
