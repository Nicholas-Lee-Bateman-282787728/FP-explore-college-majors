3718881,5,B001NHZ2L6,Had Flordia played Oklahoma the week after they played their respective conference championship game Oklahoma would have scored 60+ on Florida. Any time you give any team a month to prepare you will occasionally get an upset like this. Flordia did not run up the score on Oklahoma either. The announcers could have been worse. Try some of the announcers who call the womens football league games. Now that is bad.,1251676800,,413,4.830985915492958
3718882,5,B001NHZ2L6,"Overall the DVD is very good.  Of course it was a televised game so the main game coverage was amazing.  Nice camera shots of sweet plays is a plus.  They have a good bit of extra content and they did a fair job of being impartial.  Personally, I love the Gators.  I have not found any easter eggs yet, not sure if there are any.  If you are a football fan, you should get this DVD.  It is a great game in my opinion.  Especially, being able to see two Heisman winning quarterbacks facing off against one another.

To make it short, great game!  A must for any Gator fan.",1239753600,,571,4.109090909090909
3718883,4,B001NHZ2L6,"As far as the game is concerned, it wasn't one of the most exciting Championship games in history. The game was droned out because of too many penalties and lengthy play reviews. The defenses shined while two of the top rated offenses were very error prone. Florida did make a great comeback in the second half to take their second title in three years under Under Meyer. Florida, as always, was fun to watch. Tebow and Harvin were flashy and dynamic.

Fox's broadcast was disgraceful. My first issue was with the choice of commentators. It kills me when the commentators chosen for the most important game of the year barely cover games during the season. I want a crew that work college football all day Saturday and cover the mid week games during the year. These guys know the players; they know the teams; and they have earned the right to commentate the biggest game of the year. However, Fox chose Thom Brennamen and Charles Davis to cover the game, which are two guys that I've barely heard of. The commentating was even amateur and embarrassing at times. One of the gnetleman started cheering at one point as if he was a fan. Commentators should never show irrational emotion or favoritism like that (unless its a local broadcast). Unfortunately, this is how most stations choose their commentating crews for the championhip games, but it seems that Fox usually makes the most embarrassing choices for the big game.

My second issue with the Fox broadcast was the cameras. I know that this is the big game, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you have to put on an elaborate show. The multiple camera angles got distracting and annoying. Fox was changing angles too many times before the snap. There were a couple times when they changed the camera angle right at the moment of the snap causing me to lose focus on the play formations and direction of the ball.

Although the broadcast wasn't the greatest and the game wasn't super exciting, it was a great display of football. There were some very talented players on the field and some great teams. Definitely a great day to be a Gator!",1234483200,8,2100,4.685636856368563

8327052,3,B001NHZ2L6,"It was a pretty good game and broadcast, ruined only in that it was not played on a neutral field and the announcers fawned over certain players while they sought to diminish the affect that Oklahoma's star running back's injury and subsequent inability to play in the championship game would have.  My main commentary that might be considered negative is it is sad that SEC teams get de facto home fields for championship games.  LSU has never won a championship on a neutral field, winning all three of its championship games over 50 years in the de facto home confines of the bayou, and Florida has won two of its three on SEC home fields for all practical purposes.  Play it in Kansas City or Dallas or even Tulsa, a city in middle America, if you want a fair game. The announcers were overly hot for Tebow, a character reminiscent of Gaston in Disney's Beauty and the Beast.  Listen to the lyrics of Gaston and you have the announcer's bent.",1265760000,,946,4.547058823529412
