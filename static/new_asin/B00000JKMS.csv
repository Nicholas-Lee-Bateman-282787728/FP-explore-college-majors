However, with the death of WCW and the subsequent rise in value of their PPV tapes, this VHS is now a pretty good investment.  Aside from covering the main event of '97 (now going for $75 on this site), it goes into detail on every worthwhile match from both '98 and '99 (which would run you about $40-$50 altogether)

If you're not a WCW fan who needs every single match, these 'Best of' tapes are real moneysavers.  I recommend this one.",1227398400,,617,4.2844827586206895
