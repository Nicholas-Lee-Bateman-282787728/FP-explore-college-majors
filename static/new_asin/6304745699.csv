7876721,2,6304745699,what the hell was metalblade thinking? normally when you get a dvd version of something that was released in VHS you get the original footage with very good quality. this dvd was recorded directly from the VHS. They just passed that garbage quality over to DVD. I thought for a second this might be a fake one but it's not. metalblade doesn't give a dam and this is their top band.,1473897600,,381,4.380281690140845

7876723,1,6304745699,"I like this band a lot, but this DVD is a rip off. The sound is muffled and absolutely horrible. The footage is ok, but I couldn't get past the sound problems. I would definitely stick with the live cannibalism DVD.",1111968000,2,215,4.2682926829268295
7876724,5,6304745699,"This is one of my favorite Cannibal Corpse DVD's in my collection. I once brought it on VHS format many years ago but latter on DVD when it was released.

What you will see on this DVD is some killer performences from 4 killer shows during the Monolith Of Death tour or the tour for the Vile album. Some of the footage is not in the same caliber as the footage on Live Cannibalism but it's still raw, crued, heavy and brutal. So no Cannibal Corpse die-hard will be dissapointed.

There is also the unsensored video for Devoured By Vermin, photo gellery, discography and some interview footage which really is an extanded version of that extra footage from the Live Cannibalism DVD.

So alll and all, buy this DVD and experience some live cannibalism at the hands of the monolith of death known as Cannibal Corpse. Enjoy the trip.",1110412800,6,829,4.550335570469799
7876725,2,6304745699,"I'm a huge cannibal corpse fan and have seen them many times. And in my opinion this dvd takes away the amazing experience that is a cannibal corpse show. The sound and picture on this dvd was so bad it gave me a headache,the only part i enjoyed was the three songs from poland. I was upset for spending the $25 dollars, im just not impressed with bootlegs i guess. If you like bootleg style videos then this is the one for you. But I highly recommend LIVE CANNALBALISM over this one, the sound and picture blows this dvd out of the water.",1072224000,8,539,4.242718446601942
7876726,5,6304745699,"I would have to say that this video is pretty awesome! The quality of the sound and the picture on this video are not of the best quality because this video was recorded on a bunch of camcorders. The best show I think they did was the show at the beginning of the video in Poland. Besides the awesome Devoured by Vermin video that they do at the end. But I am a big cannibal corpse fan. Especially because I am a death metal guitarist/vocalist myself. Overall, If you have never seen cannibal corpse play live, and you're a big corpse fan like me, then you should definitely get this video.",1035331200,,590,4.324324324324325

7876728,4,6304745699,"If you're just curious about what Corpse is live, but you're not into them, DON'T GET THIS VIDEO. It's basically a bunch of camcorder videos compiled onto on video. There's one view per song. It's got great songs on here, especially ""Hammer Smashed Face,"" but to truly appreciate this, you've probably got to be a big fan of these guys or a collector. One really cool thing about the video though, it contains the video for ""Devoured By Vermin."" It's... interesting, you could say. You might even wonder what the hell just happened. You'll have to see it. Get ""Live Cannibalism"" if you want more quality, but get this if you're a Corpse fan.",1009756800,2,641,4.631578947368421
7876729,5,6304745699,This video is for people who may not of ever seen cannibal corpse show live. Buy this you will not be sorry!,961891200,4,108,3.9545454545454546
