the adult entertainment for which Cannes is famous.  Perhaps
this viewer paid too little attention to the way the program content
was described.",1384300800,,202,4.9411764705882355
7972767,5,B00006RJKV,"This review is coming from a Troma Fanatic, so what I say is kind of biased...

All the Love You Cannes is a brilliant documentary. Maybe not briliiant really, but it is one of the most entertaining docs I have seen in a long time (and I watch a lot of docs). You get to see what happens when the Troma Team shows up at the Cannes Film Festival. They are there to try and get their name out there, and to sell their movies to international distributors, and a whole cast of crazy Tromen and Gynos is along to create the spectacle that seems to follow Troma everywhere now.

The movie features Doug Sakman in an unforgetable role as the biggest piece of crap that has ever walked the earth. His antics start out as entertaining, but as the movie progresses and as he shows up in more Troma stuff, they become irritating. That is really the only negative thing that I can say about this movie, but then there are idiots who show up at Troma events, unfortunately this idiot had( still has?) a job with my favorite production company.

There are plenty of crazy things going on, beautiful gynos ( a few even get naked), and more than enough Toxie, Kabukiman, and Uncle Lloydie to go around. A must see if you are a Troma fan or a fan of independent cinema.",1109635200,2,1253,4.323404255319149
7972768,4,B00006RJKV,"You have to give the Troma people some credit - they're not afraid to stab themselves in the eyeball from time to time. ""All the Love you Cannes"" apparently began life as a simple (and pretty damned useful) guide to surviving at the Cannes Film Festival on a limited budget. Places like Cannes are crucial to an independent studio like Troma - they attract international buyers, they pick up small, ... films for cheap, they get precious screenings for their films. But they also promote themselves, and here's where ""ATLYC"" turns a little ugly.
The Troma Team is willing to try every stunt imaginable to get a little publicity, including walking the streets of Cannes dressed as various Troma heroes, staging lesbian make-out sessions, hilariously crashing Jean-Claude Van Damme's ""press conference,"" where JCVD shows up for about 2 seconds. All well and good, but gradually we start to see a struggle between Scott, who prefers a businesslike approach, and Doug, the incredibly obnoxious ""Director of Marketing"" who believes that drunkenly harrassing the citizens of Cannes is good, clean marketing.
I won't tell you where Lloyd's sympathies ultimately lie (he's much more cuddly in this doc than in the making-of's of ""Terror Firmer"" and ""Citizen Toxie""), but at least I have to respect him for sticking to his guns...he'd rather support the artists who have made Troma, for better or worse, what it is today than kowtow to the people with the most money. Still, watching the behavior of the Troma team degenerate to truly ugly depths can be difficult, and might queer your sympathies toward Troma. The ending of this story is really no surprise, and Lloyd can't pin it on his entertaining-if-paranoid theories of Corporate Conspiracy. Troma definitely gives itself a purple nurple with this one.
Still, you gotta admire them for releasing this doc. It's scrappy and entertaining, and generally well-edited - it's better than ""The Making of Citizen Toxie,"" but maybe not as fun as ""The Making of Terror Firmer."" It does feature some solid advice, and some lovely Tromatic debauchery. Will it make you a bigger Troma fan? Maybe not. Will you buy their next DVD anyway? Of COURSE you will!",1062201600,5,2190,5.002739726027397
7972769,5,B00006RJKV,This DVD is a great documentary about the struggles Troma has been through with dealing with the corporate elites at Cannes film festival. It is also an interesting look at what you really have to go through as in independent filmaker. This documentary is a no holds barred guide to every step of making your own independent movie on a very small budget and coming out with great results like Lloyd. Kudos to Lloyd and the Troma Team they have put together another winner in my eyes. Check it out and you will not be dissapointed. To the die-hard fans this dvd offers a glimpse into the everyday life of Troma filmaking. LONG LIVE TROMA! Forget the hollywood pattern. Take a chance on truly independent cinema and you will be forever changed.,1055548800,3,742,4.628787878787879
