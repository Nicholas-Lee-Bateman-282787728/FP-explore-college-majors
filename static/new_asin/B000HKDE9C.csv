2638568,5,B000HKDE9C,"Not only did this DVD blow my mind, but it also came with a cool hardcover book that was like reading an issue of VICE with a window right into the writer's crazy, drug-addled minds.",1160006400,,182,4.228571428571429
2638569,5,B000HKDE9C,Now I can say I have actually seen it all... more than a magazine more than a hipster bible... its like looking in the face of the impossible... and blowing your smoke filled breath all over it... Not for the weak and limp wristed yuppies that wish they were down!!!! Get up on this PLAYA!!!!,1159920000,,292,4.327272727272727
2638570,5,B000HKDE9C,"No one in their right mind would travel like this - nothing but hellholes, freaks, and danger. Their seems little doubt that VICE has sold their collective souls to the Devil otherwise how could any of them possibly still be  of this earth.",1159833600,2,240,4.5813953488372094
2638571,5,B000HKDE9C,I gave this DVD to my  19 year old son. He really enjoyed it.,1169078400,,61,3.357142857142857
2638572,1,B000HKDE9C,"This DVD is lame.  The idea is that they go to places serious journalists won't go and do things that serious journalist's won't do; they're somewhat right because serious journalists would never produce anything so totally devoid of information.  You can see the same stories on CNN with a lot more factual content.

One of the segments involves attending a rave in the City of God, Rio's largest slum.  But they never do attend the rave, because someone tells them it's too dangerous.  Then there is a segment on what is supposedly the world's largest arms market; they show significantly fewer guns than the small gun store on my street.  The segment on the lost dinosaur in the congo is just plain goofy; all you see is some guy getting drunk and a bunch of Congolese villagers dancing around.  The Chernobyl segment could have been good except that they hyped showing mutant animals but then never showed any.  Major disappointment with the whole DVD.

There is nothing new, fresh, exciting or informative about any of this. As a previous reviewer said - they start with a good idea and then run out of steam before they can execute it.

Don't buy it unless your thing is journalism school dropouts showing why they couldn't get a job at CNN.",1167091200,11,1247,4.678899082568807
2638573,2,B000HKDE9C,"Was very excited to watch a bunch of short movies about traveling in dark and unaccessible parts of the world.  Until I actually watch it .. took me not even 45 minutes, wich is a first disapointement. The research is very poor, the filming is done without consideration for the people watching, there's a critical lack of information and focus on every story... I'm telling you, go and watch a good documentary or read articles about those regions because you won't feel like you've learned anything after watching those 'movies'.  To short, lack of research, lack of production continuity !  And believe me, I'm a fan of Vice magazine !

Don't spend your precious money on this.. you'll be seriously disappointed ! That's what I would have wanted to read before buying this dvd.",1164412800,4,780,4.798507462686567
2638574,1,B000HKDE9C,"Save your twenty bucks. While the idea behind this movie is good, the effort they put into it is lacking. They barely scratch the surface on any of their topics and don't get behind the stories they're covering. It would seem that they come up with a concept and then immediately jump on a plane to a far-off / dangerous place. They arrive knowing very little about the location, people, history or politics only to ask the locals stupid and uniformed questions and make broad quasi-political / social pronouncements that are often incorrect. Further, the people they talk to / interview are equally ignornant: ""Who is Hezbollah?"" - Spike Jonze. (?!) Wow.

  The segments are too brief and superficial to give you any real sense of how 'dangerous' these places are. It feels like they did these things just for their trophy value ... standing still long enough to take a snapshot and then jumping on a plane back to NYC. Rather than cramming 8 segments into 90 minutes, they'd be better advised to spread these out into 30 - 40 minutes pieces each over multiple releases. I'm not looking for Frontline-type production on this, just something with a little more depth than ""See what I did?"".",1163721600,16,1190,4.739130434782608
2638575,2,B000HKDE9C,"nice packaging and a nice idea aren't enough to carry this half azzed rambling poorly produced unfocused underdeveloped poorly executed badly finished boring mess.

Vice's writing always had this weakness: they start with a good idea, and ramble until they run out of steam.  If they do any more videos,  I suggest they hire professional TV producers to come along. Some of the ideas are good and its disappointing to have them lame out halfway through the bit.

THis video is not gonzo its boring.",1162771200,4,498,4.823529411764706
2638576,2,B000HKDE9C,"i'd like to give this a great review, but basically everytime anything is about to get good on this dvd, the credits roll...seriously, they went to the Congo and did nothing it seems...to search for a dinosaur?",1161302400,4,210,4.702702702702703
2638577,5,B000HKDE9C,"Not only is the VICE Guide hilarious and entertaining but each section actually has a point... sorta. It takes on serious issues, without getting too serious. I thought it was hilarious and really well done.

Personally I LOVED the China section which was practically hidden away in the ""Extras"" section, but every single, completely unique chapter left me shocked, or laughing or both.

Great stuff",1160352000,2,399,5.123076923076923
2638578,4,B000HKDE9C,"I pre-ordered this thing a while back and received it the other day and I've watched it about 3 times in the past couple of days.  There's a lot going on here and a lot of times I'd shake my head and drop my jaw and am just amazed.  Not every word uttered is factually correct, but if the mission was to make it impossible to avoid some really ugly things about the world, mission accomplished.  In one of the most haunting scenes, 3 children in Beirut sit in their living room and sing a song about dying for their country so that they can kill Israelis.  And they must've filmed this long before the whole conflict began, and it's just goose-bump causing.

I wish that the segments were longer, I can only imagine what's on that cutting room floor, but the accompanying book does a lot to fill in where I wish the segments had continued.  The pix are amazing (kids playing ping pong with flip flops as paddles in the City of God favela is pretty arresting) and the stories are what you would expect of Vice writers getting serious.  Nice interview with the kid from Bonde de Role as well, whose music is featured in the Rio segment.  Interesting to hear about how they viewed music as their way out of the slum.

Overall, really impressed.  Can't wait to see what they come up with next.",1160006400,7,1289,4.355648535564853
2638579,5,B000HKDE9C,I am continuously amazed that these people are still alive.  After years of covering the stupidest and sometimes heavily dangerous topics in the magazine now they've moved onto video...Although the magazine is free this actually was a really great purchase.  The DVD rules and the book that comes with it is excellent.  The David Cross material is G-O-L-D-E-N.,1160006400,7,360,5.172413793103448
2638580,5,B000HKDE9C,"When it comes to the Vice Guide to Travel, one question eclipses all others: Is it the best film ever made?

For years, I have avoided writing a review of this movie, intimidated perhaps by its immense reputation. Having missed the awesome screening, I had only seen the Vice Guide to Travel on the small screen, and it didn't seem right somehow to discuss a picture of this magnitude without viewing it at least once in the manner originally envisioned. Well, some five years after I started writing reviews, the opportunity arose at a small film festival. This review is the result of that screening.

The Vice Guide to Travel has been lauded as the greatest motion picture to come out of America during any era. It also represents the pinnacle of VICE's film making career. For, although VICE  will live on forever following the release of The Vice Guide to Travel, they will undoubtedly succeeded in recapturing the brilliance or fulfilling the promise of this first feature.

As a film, The Vice Guide to Travel is a powerful dramatic tale about the uses and abuses of wealth and power. It's a classic American tragedy about people of great passion, vision, and greed, who push themselves until they bring ruins to themselves and all around them. Of course, the production aspect that makes The Vice Guide to Travel so memorable is VICE's landmark cinematography. In fact, it's impossible to have a serious discussion about this film without mentioning this element.

The movie is a visual masterpiece, a kaleidoscope of daring angles and breathtaking images that had never been attempted before, and has never been equaled since. VICE perfected a deep-focus technique that allowed them to photograph backgrounds with as much clarity as foregrounds. There's also an extremely effective low-angle shot late in the film where some crazy crap happens. The cinematography documentary, Visions of Light, devoted an entire section to The Vice Guide to Travel.

If any other film has come close to the nearly-perfect artistry of this one, I haven't seen it. Anyone foolishly wondering how black-and-white images could be superior to color needs only to watch the first few frames of The Vice Guide to Travel to understand. Not only is it impossible to envision this picture in color, the very thought is blasphemous.

There's no doubt that The Vice Guide to Travel is far ahead of its time. Uncompromising, unsentimental drama of this sort is not in vogue during an era that is better known for titles like Roll Bounce, ATL, and Snakes on a Plane. In challenging everyone else, VICE forces a clash of egos that has wide-ranging repercussions. Yet, out of the conflict, The Vice Guide to Travel emerges stronger than ever. Would the film be as compelling if we didn't know how close it came to never being released? Or if we didn't recognize the parallels between the life of the main characters and that of the directors?

All of this brings me back to the question that I opened the review with: Is The Vice Guide to Travel the best movie ever made? Many critics would argue ""yes"" without pause, but my enthusiasm is more restrained. While I acknowledge that The Vice Guide to Travel is a seminal masterpiece, I don't think it's the greatest motion picture of all time. Even so, there's no denying the debt that the movie industry owes to VICE and their debut feature. Motion picture archives and collections across the world would be poorer without copies of this film, which will forever be recognized as a defining example of American cinema.",1160006400,,3544,4.865671641791045
8140151,5,B000HKDE9C,This is a great dvd plus comes in a small book going a little deeper into each story. Pretty awesome stuff!!,1361664000,,108,4.190476190476191
8140152,5,B000HKDE9C,these aren't full episodes which is annoying but Vice is always entertaining and the quality of the DVD was good. Comes with a book too,1353974400,,135,4.44
8140153,4,B000HKDE9C,Great episode on North Korea - very eye opening!!  With what's going on today - it makes you feel a little uneasy on what's next for North Korea.,1326585600,,145,4.178571428571429
8140154,1,B000HKDE9C,"I was surprised by the quality of this guide as I have previously purchased ""The Vice guide to sex, drugs and rock & roll"" and it was an awesome book.
This guide is composed by bad and short articles that lead to nowhere, I really don't think this is up to the quality I am used to from this guys.",1308528000,,297,3.966666666666667
8140155,2,B000HKDE9C,The North Korea one is pretty awesome because it's one of the only real documentaries which show an American getting into the country. The rest are pretty much worthless.,1293840000,,170,4.896551724137931
8140156,2,B000HKDE9C,"Guess what?  The third world is filled with guns, drugs, and prostitution, all fueled by desperation.  Who knew?

I started paying attention to VICE after reading some more serious commentary by Gavin McInnes.  However, most of what I have seen of Vice has turned out to be immature drivel.  There isn't much that demonstrates more serious insight behind the ""comedic"" moments.

This DVD was a waste of my time and money.  And frankly, I think it was a waste of the Vice staff's time and money, too.

One extra star for nice packaging.",1271894400,,535,4.67741935483871

8140158,3,B000HKDE9C,"The Vice Guide to Travel is a unique compilation of  short segments relating to Vice Magazines coverage of some of the most dangerous spots on earth. In a 60 minute whirlwind tour we are taken to Beirut to see a training ground of suicide bombers, Chernobyl to visit the deserted town, Bulgaria to purchase a warhead, the Congo, slums of Rio, the gun market of Darra, Pakistan and a lost colony of Nazis in Paraguay.

While this is not great journalism it is an interesting watch. The segments are too short to provide much information and the extras are a bit bare but all in all its worth a  rental.",1244160000,,601,4.445454545454545
8140159,2,B000HKDE9C,"Well... I'm never really let down with Vice, however this video left me with that feeling as though I was blue balled.  Why? Well I thought it was going to be someone informative or show so actual stuff but the whole DVD came across as a fake.  They get wasted and chat with people and nothing seems to add up.  I mean getting drunk and going to places is fun and all but I felt this movie just didn't pack any punch.

vice... you have let me down with this one.  Don't think I'll be purchasing another DVD from you in the near future but I will keep all your mags as they rule.",1212364800,2,578,4.035087719298246
