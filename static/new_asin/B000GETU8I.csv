8131152,5,B000GETU8I,"The ""Tracks Ahead"" video series, broadcast by PBS (thru Milwaukee PBS) has 6 or 7 volumes that may still be available as tapes or DVDs. They are WELL worth seeking out for rail fans and historians.
This series features photographers and historians from the latter part of the 20th century. One of these, Jim Fredrickson, a former NP employee, was interviewed for one of the Tracks Ahead collections. In addition, he has written at least 3 excellent photo and essay collections regarding rail history in the Northwest. Amazon is a good place to start for a link to his work:
