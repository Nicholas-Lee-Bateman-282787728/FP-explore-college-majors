8588620,4,630594413X,"The Amazon reviewer captured this movie perfectly -- I'm here to tell you it's not hype.  I caught this during its one public screening in L.A.; when I learned it would show briefly in NYC, I called friends there and warned them that missing it now meant missing it forever.  Thank God I was wrong!  BTK is a blast.
The comparison to Suzuki Seijun is a bit misleading.  With Suzuki, enjoyment depends on your appreciation for his idiosyncracies and how they overtake the standard genre moves.  Black Tight Killers, however, doesn't subvert 60's spy flicks; it jazzes them up.  Where Bond movies are sly, BTK is loopy; while Bond has become very familiar, the unwinking giddiness to this offshoot tastes fresh.  The cinematography and design keep the party going:  Unable to compete with 007 lushness, they compensate (and then some) with style and humor.
It might not have the substance of a five-star movie, but Black Tight Killers gave me a five-star time.  If it sounds like your thing, definitely check it out!",972432000,9,1014,4.815028901734104
