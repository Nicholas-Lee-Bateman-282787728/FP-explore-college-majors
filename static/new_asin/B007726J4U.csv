5058987,5,B007726J4U,"Saw this film on the big screen and loved it because it was scary without being gory, and Cloris Leachman and the rest of the cast are outstanding. It is well done for a film with a small budget and the fact that it is based on true events is freaky and makes it that much better. A perfect summer thriller!",1331078400,32,307,4.049180327868853
5058988,2,B007726J4U,"Accidentally watched this film twice, once on Netflix which I completely forgot doing, and now here on Amazon.  Not a horror movie, just a story of a young boy from a dysfunctional family and a vivid imagination with some hippies from the early 70's during the charles manson trials.  Strange, and almost interesting, but not riveting.  Can't really recommend it, but who knows, you might like it.",1495670400,,397,4.895522388059701
5058989,5,B007726J4U,"I cannot imagine anyone NOT giving this movie five stars. It scared the living STARCH out of me! It never slowed down; it was terrifying; there was no way to possibly figure out what was the source of the evil. There was a lot of bad language, and it's wayyyyyy too scary for a kid. NO SPOILER: Paralleling the storyline with the Manson murders was brilliant. I just can't understand anyone not LOVING this movie, if you want a scary movie. My heart is STILL pounding while I'm writing this! It has horror, terror, screaming, killing, guns, spooky things in a cornfield, doors rattling, glass breaking, animal murders, and freaky, nightmarish songs being sung by grotesquely disfigured girls and deformed relatives. I mean, people, what do you WANT? This has it ALL!",1495065600,,766,4.8106060606060606

5058992,4,B007726J4U,I would've given it 5 stars if it didn't take so long to get good it just started super slow but has interesting twist and turns i had to keep watching to see what happened  it was really good but had the potential to be fantastic a few more details or something big happening would have pushed it over the top they could make a sequal and finish it up so we know more about the field and why they refused to let him go in it etc... Its worth the wait to the end,1491868800,2,462,3.863157894736842
5058993,5,B007726J4U,"This movie had haunted me since the first time I watched it.
Watching it again today I'm sure I noticed some things I hadn't before... things that changed my interpretation of what might be going on in the film.
Even then, I'm not sure... but I love that aspect of it, that it's open to interpretation.
I'd put this movie in the same vein as the excellent Parents and The Reflecting Skin... both of them about a kid's view of what MIGHT be some disturbing events.
Did everything in The Fields happen as shown? Or was some of it embellished by the imagination of the boy? Were there malevolent 'hippies' living in the old amusement park? Was the corn field itself manifesting the fears of the boy?
The film requires a viewer who is paying close attention and is patient enough to notice its patterns.
For one thing... noticed that whenever the boy goes into the corn field the stalks are dry and brown... but then, as he goes further, and comes out into whatever he finds on the other side... the corn stalks are lush and green.",1491609600,2,1027,4.468085106382978

5058995,2,B007726J4U,When I got up and left the room for 45 seconds- did I miss the plot?! This film was plotless  and  pointless. I'm giving  two stars because the cinematography was good and Cloris Leachman carried this movie as only she could.,1489881600,,225,4.439024390243903
5058996,4,B007726J4U,What I got out of this film was memories of how I saw situations as a child.  Many of my own views of the world mixed in with actual events could be made into their own horror films.  If you go into it expecting it to be an ordinary story that is going to take your hand and walk you through the plot...you're going to be let down.,1489276800,,331,3.8529411764705883
5058997,1,B007726J4U,That was a hour plus of time I will never get back. The movie was dry and a very weak story line with zero horror. The child is the main character and he is even boring. The movie ends with nothing explained or even a hint of what the hell was going on.. DONT waste your time!!!!,1489190400,,279,3.912280701754386

5058999,2,B007726J4U,"I wasn't expecting too much from this movie, since I watched it for free.  I liked the American Gothic atmosphere.  The cinematography was really good. There were some decent moments of suspense, but it wasn't really all that scary.  Cloris Leachman was way over the top as the grandmother and was the saving grace of the film.  I was disappointed in the ending.  I like more plot resolution.",1488758400,,392,4.705882352941177
5059000,1,B007726J4U,"I rarely give one star reviews, and only give them when it's so bad I end up turning it off, which I eventually did. I started to watch it because Cloris Leachman is a fine actor, and while some may question Tara Reid's acting chops, all things considered, she is a fairly major star. Whoever said this movie has no plot is spot on. It is a series of surreal, random montages that make no sense. I could respect it if it were an attempt at some sort of expression of Dada, but as a piece of entertainment, it's junk. Don't waste your time.",1488672000,,539,4.1923076923076925

5059003,5,B007726J4U,Scared the Hell out of me!  One has to put themselves in the 1973 mindset.  Things were very different.  The hippies were not so free loving as we often imagine them to be.  They were often spaced out and thieves and sometimes murderers who preyed on others.  I remember it very well.  We kept telling them to get a job.,1488240000,,320,4.25

1) There are no characters, nor a protagonist
2) There are no bad guys, nor an antagonist
3) No plot, no arc, no resolution.

5059007,3,B007726J4U,"This was an ""Okay"", yet, ""low-budget"" movie. The title didn't really reflect the plot. I'm not really sure how to word it without giving away the movie ending. You should watch it though. It has quite a bit of ""scare"" moments, but more mystery than anything. The grandma is a hoot! Overall, this was a good movie for what it is and is worth the watch.",1487980800,,351,4.333333333333333
5059008,2,B007726J4U,Good acting and sets. Not a good movie for fans of things like plots and 'it's gotta be worth my time'. At least Tara Reid stayed sober for her parts.,1487808000,,150,4.033333333333333
5059009,1,B007726J4U,Expected much more from talent such as Cloris Leachman but the whole script/dialogues were lame. Not one minute of entertainment.,1487721600,3,129,5.5
5059010,3,B007726J4U,"Movie was twilight zonish too me. I thought little boy was hard headed and too grown for his age. I wanted too spank him during this movie. More weird than scary, definitely shows us were the wild things are. I can relate because my grandparents told us too stay out the cornfield but as a curious child you can't help it, it's fun but also super scary to get lost in a cornfield.",1487635200,,380,4.219178082191781
5059011,4,B007726J4U,"A neat little movie that has plausibility written all over it. Good suspense, plenty of misdirection (done pretty well, no less). Every character is pretty flawed and quite believable. In a world of FX-driven nonsense, vampires, zombies, and X-men this is a nice, welcome retreat.

STORY: There is a story here if you understand the context of the movie and national mood/state of country after the 1969 Manson murders. You had a movement that was traditionally defined as peaceful (flower-power/hippy) suddenly transmogrified to a murdering cult with a charismatic, sinister leader. That was a betrayal of trust to the American psyche that spawned plenty of paranoia that is well-expressed in this movie. If you get this, you will get the movie.

A Note on the Setting: Rural farmlands comprised of large cornfields create an exceptionally isolated atmosphere (ie: Signs, Field of Dreams, Children of the Corn). It's used effectively especially given the time period where police response time wasn't quite what it is today. This movie provides some great warnings on why one should stay away from the cornfield in often hilariously disturbing detail.

ACTING: Also some good stuff here. The kid (Joshua Ormand) does a good job of portraying a youth that is a bit lost, seen too much, and essentially has far too strange an extended family to begin with.  What he is afraid of interesting compared to the experiences he has had with his immediate and extended family. (There is some wonderful irony thrown in here about scary movies and their effects on children). The father (Faust Checho-great name) is decent playing a troubled father, the mother (Tara Reid) doesn't have much to do here but does an adequate job as the abused spouse.  The good stuff comes from the grandparents: The loving, protective grandfather (Tom McCarthy) seems very authentic and the foul-mouthed grandmother (a hilarious Cloris Leachman) provides ample comic relief for balancing the unsettling mood. These two are polar opposites that both obviously love the boy.  Without spoiling I will say the flower girls are wonderfully unsettling, mirroring the behavior and blank smiles of the Manson Family (Google for pics and video, kids).

Special FX: Not much here was needed, which is very good.

Audio: Adequate, and there is some nice subtle audio when the boy visits the deserted town.

Score: Wonderfully understated.

Overall:  This was a low-budget (not through necessity it would seem) movie that was pretty well-directed and acted.  For the uninitiated, do some research on the Manson family before- or after -watching.

Caveat: If you enjoy the mindless torture-pornography of the Saw and Hostel franchises, you probably won't like this film. For the rest of us, there is some nice suspense here.",1487635200,,2783,5.157777777777778

5059013,4,B007726J4U,"This is an interesting little film if not quite perfect.  Cloris Leachman IS perfect, however, and I usually love anything she is in.  The child, Joshua Ormond, is very good and just right for this role.  Heck, even Tara Reid did a good job! The look of this film is eerie and captures backwoods life--we're talking REALLY backwoods here--to a tee.  The story is a little disjointed, but this is one of the better movies I've seen in a while.  Not a super scary thriller, this is more of a drama/suspense film.",1487289600,,510,4.5

5059142,4,B007726J4U,"Not counting Cloris Leachman, who is hands-down one of the best elements of this film, the film itself isn't bad. In fact, it's kinda good. It takes place in the seventies, during the days of Charles Manson and his cult. The protagonist, a young boy visiting his grandparents for a spell as his parents work out their problems and interested in the Manson cases, is told from the beginning to stay out of the cornfield, but unable to not take a bite of this forbidden fruit he finds himself exploring its insides and makes a horrible discovery. Further disconcerting is when his grandfather takes him into town where the boy is approached by a strange young hippie woman who creeps him out by something she says to him. She seemed to be with a small group of hippies hanging around a van. Further disconcerting, and frightening, is a man that the young boy sees in places such as on the street and around his grandfolks' house. Is this mystery man merely a ghost, or even more horrifyingly, is he real?
Much of the tone of the film is one of tension:  hearing voices in the cornfield, hearing and seeing people outside of the house at night, ominous shots of the cornfield, the mystery man, and the suspicious nature of the hippie strangers.
If for anything, the performance of Mel Brooks' seasoned muse Cloris Leachman is a great reason to watch the film. She brings life to her character through curmudgeonly crassness, deadpan sarcasm, and her signature dry wit.
I say give it a go for the good price here if you haven't seen it yet and could catch it for free on the internet first and like it. If not for free, there's a site called Cloudload where you can download 10 gigs of films and shows for $5 a month. They offer more gigabytes for more money. For instance, I have a $10 a month account and get fifty gigs. 80% more gigs for five more bucks is a great fricken deal!

Sadly, there is really nothing frightening here: a little boy goes to stay with his grandparents while his parents work through a fight, and some young transients have left a dead body in the corn field. Except for the grandpa, the casting is unbelievable; the dialogue is bad, as it always is when Northern writers try to present Southern language; and the most frightening moment may be when the little boy shoots his plastic dinasaur with his BB gun.

The eclectic family was an interesting commentary on ""normal America"" vs. subgroups who have less acceptance by the dominant culture. The view from the fields is that we're all nuts.

Unsure of who to trust, Steven keeps the information to himself, but whatever is lurking in the corn now has his scent! There is a heartfelt story buried somewhere within THE FIELDS, but it has yet to be discovered. The film feels like a hazy memory, and one that is filled with irrelevant facts and details that in no way serve to better the plot. At best, it represents the underlying fear and paranoia that spread following the Manson Murders, however, the remote location and un-compelling characters do nothing to draw us in. The documentary-style filming does lend an air of authenticity to the events, along with the set and costume designs. Although we want to root for Joshua Ormond as Steven, he simply isn't prepared to carry the male lead in a feature film. Between this and the general inactivity on-screen, it becomes difficult to recommend THE FIELDS to anyone outside of the True Crime enthusiasts.

There is no ""possesion"" by ""evil"", though you could argue at least the later of those two are present.  This is the movie that really drove it home that I have to pay attention to which genre Netflix has put a film in, rather than how they describe it.  Though I can't say it was very ""thrilling"" either, at least not until much later in the film.  Though perhaps Netflix isn't the problem as I get here to Amazon and thier blurb makes it sound a bit more interesting than it really is too.  I did like the characters & their interactions.  They are so natural I'm left wondering how much was ad-libbed.  As for the film I was both intrigued & bored.  At times I'm thinking it's all an escape from reality but in the end it just seems like a coming of age story.  It's possible it just serves best as an exampe of how desensitized we have become to violence since the boy sees his father pointing a gun at his own mother, but later is excited to get a b b gun as a gift from that same father.  The real world is a scary place, as the deranged hippies (who I'm assuming were somehow tied to the Manson cult) aren't afraid to show.  I think perhaps the film tried to become about too many things at once & was left not being a very strong example of any of them.",1356825600,,1428,4.13768115942029
5059164,2,B007726J4U,"I really don't know what to think of this movie. The acting is wonderful. The scenery of rural America in the 60's is perfect. The story of the couple struggling to deal with their violent marital problems, their young son going off to stay with his grandparents, the child's fear that are fueled by recent events happening in the country and what he sees and hears through the media about the Manson family, all of it is a compelling story.
Those elements alone would have made this an interesting movie to watch. But, this being a thriller, the elements of terror eventually had to be introduced. That's where it all fell apart for me. The plot becomes convoluted. Characters are thrown in for no apparent reason other than to misdirect the viewers attention. Things occur that seem to have absolutely no reason for happening.

I watched the special features after the movie, hoping to get some clarification by learning the real story on which the movie is based. No help there. Listening to the actual real life character that this supposedly happened to, I got the impression that nothing really happened. It seemed more that he had written a story about a traumatic family issue and blended that with something that was reputed to have happened in the town. The result was a potentially good family drama being ruined with crazy dream like sequences and disjointed scenes.",1356480000,3,1378,4.814345991561181

You feel like you are really with these people...just eavesdropping.  And scarier than the cornfield is the visit to Leachman's sister and her family.

5059166,3,B007726J4U,"""The Fields"" doesn't know if it wants to be a supernatural horror film or a crime thriller, and that is the biggest problem with this film.  Now, I have no problem with either genre.  As a matter of fact, I like them both, when done well.  However, I believe that this film succeeds at being neither.  But the question of the day might be:  why did the director and writer decide to go in this direction?

Well, supposedly, this is based upon ""true events,"" whatever that means.  Some strange things were going down on the farm; were they ghosts or were they demons?  Or were they scarey carneys perhaps?  Well, the movie never seems to really say either way, and I'm not exactly sure that I even care after watching.  And most likely, no one really knew exactly what happened in real life, so the writer decided to take the easy way out and leave it open for interpretation for the viewer.

Cloris Leachman is very good here.  I did get quite a few laughs out of her schtick.  And I found Joshua Ormond to be interesting; he reminded me of Danny Bonaduce from ""The Partridge Family,"" which is fitting since this film is set in the same era.  I think that some of the era was expressed here in the film, but some of the Charles Manson references were a bit overdone.

It seemed like the film came from Mr. Ormond's perspective.  He looks up at the corn, and so do we.  As a matter of fact, everything to him is scary and foreboding, and we're supposed to be scared as well:  The corn.  The old, deserted carnival.  The scary relatives in the basement.  The clown on his dresser.  Surely, all of this was intentional by the director, not that I'm convinced that it actually worked.  I wasn't particularly scared by any of it.

I wish that the film would have chosen what it wanted to be.  If it had, I'd maybe recommend it.  But I'll have to give it a minor pass.",1355702400,2,1862,4.340116279069767

5059168,2,B007726J4U,"It all depends on what scares you.  If you're frightened by folks who are rural, old, or speech impaired, this movie might give you nightmares.  If cows cause you to cower, you're in for a shiver.  If, however, corn fields make you flinch, these stalks will just seem corny.  The fact is, corn fields are naturally and truly scary.  You can't see what's in them.  The bladelike leaves rustle spookily in the wind and will cut you if you carelessly pass through them.  If the stalks are tall, you can get disoriented within their depths.  Stephen King knows all about it--as he does about clowns, for that matter.  The creators of this film, however, apparently do not--though feeble attempts are made to make both images terrorizing.
Is this feature meant to be realistic, surrealistic, parodical, satirical, or absurdist?  Like an abstract painting, it's seemingly whatever you perceive it to be.  If you can believe that in Pennsylvania, in 1972, a commercial dairy farm could be situated in a filthy, squalid barn that co-housed hogs, then maybe you could see it as realistic.  Or, if it seems likely that, in that era, a bullied little country boy would go around with Shirley Temple locks or that a bigoted white oldster would entertain a kinswoman and her black beau...well, DO believe this:  in the seventies, common people did not over-spice their sentences with the F-word in the form of nouns, verbs, and adjectives!
If you discern the movie as surreal or absurdist, no explanatiion is probably necessary--or even possible.  As parody or simple satire, though, the film can be more readily understood.  Since the vast majority of modern horror has heavy overtones of comedy, it should be no surprise that this offering is so sardonic in tone.  The rustic and the elderly, being symbols of traditionalism, can both be easily presented as iconic villains in contemporary features aimed at the very young, the urban, and the avant-garde.  Even the mentally and physically handicapped are permissably made funny if they are the results of rubish inbreeding.
In actuality, great effort appears to have been put into the making of this movie.  The stark lighting, hollow sound quality, and sterile landscapes are undoubtedly attempts to convey a sense of unease, and, for those who find trepidation in rusty propane tanks and peeling paint, the result certainly constitutes eeriness.  For most lovers of horror film, however, this offering is bound to fail on all levels.  The movie has no discernable plot, no suspense, no revelation, and no conclusion.  It is simply a series of events in which the protagonist is frightened by odd people and unsavory places.  As a sort of psychological tableau, it succeeds.  As a horror movie, it does not.",1353715200,4,2748,4.964989059080962

5059173,4,B007726J4U,"The Fields is a perfect thrill-filled horror flick. There's no gore, no screaming soundtrack, and no naked coeds flashing big new implants at you in 3D - so if you're under say 30, you may not appreciate the style. I, personally, feel this was the scariest film I have seen since the original Chainsaw Massacre ruined countless nights of sleep all those years ago.

Corn fields - the fields they reference here - are some how creepy; always have been. Add to that filming when the corn is gone, and the six foot carcasses of stalk line up to create their own Halloween-worthy forest scape...one's imagination can roam into a frenzied Fearland at the mere thought of a crow taking flight.

That being said, the story goes...It's 1973, and young Steven's (Joshua Ormond) parents are having a few problems. His overseers are too busy suspecting and accusing to allow focus to fall on the youngin'. So, off to grandma's house he goes.

His father's parents' place. This quirky duo is a long-married tough sonovabitch sort. Gladys (Cloris Leachman) is eccentric and delightfully foul-mouthed, in that way many of us recall our own grand parents using the forbidden words as colorful adjectives. Hiney (Bev Appleton) is the sweet grandfather - he still has his post-deviling sparkle twinkling in those old eyes of his though.

Their humble farm rests against a corn field; the kind that, while off-putting, beckons for perusal. Naturally little Steven is drawn in like any horror tale's main character...especially when he is told he better not go in there or he'll end up, as his loving grandma likes to point out, black and bloated and dead.

Faster than you can say, ""Godzilla has attacked Toyk..."" the lad sneaks within.

At this point of the film, you are petrified. All they've done is play some mood-altering music, showed a dysfunctional family's secrets, and reminded you about the Manson trial presently in their headlines.

But, you are there with Steven. He's a curious, smart kid. Still he is a child. He sincerely ponders that this Manson chap could be out and about, taking their exit to get some fresh veggies and whatnots. Sure, Steven is in Pennsylvania, and Manson is behind bars in California - but Steven heard the phrase parole on the radio and that's enough to ignite his nightmares.

Manson aside, something's up, and Steven is tuned in to it. And you're watching all this from his perspective.

The Fields is brilliant. Screenwriter B. Harrison Smith wove a fine freckled fearfest here. Each of the characters is deeply built. Here, you won't find yourself yelling at the kuckudoo-for-brains characters for their stupid reactions; they are scared too - and they listen. You get the feeling the film makers crossed their T's and made sure people in this film were on the ball. From editing, location, clothes, set design - they didn't hand you an, ""Oh come on!"" moment once.

You genuinely winced and begged Steve to get the hell outta there, and when he visits his ""odd"" aunt, you skeeve through the whole section of frames. That's the secret of The Fields' success; continued simple empathetic manipulations of the celluloid canvas before you.

Joshua Ormond (Steven) is simply delightful. His face tells the story, and his ability to share fear is incredible; a lot was on this young actor's shoulders and he pulled off an Atlas-style showing. His parents Tara Reid and Faust Checho are spot on as young adults in a strained marriage. Johnson as Hiney is fabulous. And, let's be frank...I don't adore too many actor folks; one of my personal chickbabe idols, Cloris Leachman is one holding the Royal Flush at this high-stakes table of career-making hands. Leachman wields her ""Gladys"" like she's channeling some lower-middle-class grandma's skeleton-filled closet's soul. And, many of her lines make you bellow aloud towards the screen. Yet, her fear and care for the child are clear as a mosquito tableau in the finest Soviet amber (Watch her and I at The Pirate's of the Caribbean Red Carpet - she does a bit from High Anxiety).

Get this. From The Fields' first atmospheric frame you can just tell this quiet film is gonna scare the bejeesus out of you. The people behind the film have grand futures. And, Joshua Ormond will be walking some red shaded carpets soon; let's hope he has a good support system to avoid his own E! True Hollywood Story special.

5059177,3,B007726J4U,"THE FIELDS oozes a creepy American Gothic atmosphere, is filmed beautifully, and features Oscar winner Cloris Leachman in another Oscar-worthy performance.  Set in 1973 Pennsylvania, the movie is based on writer Harrison Smith's youth.  Joshua Ormond, a bright-eyed, mop-topped Booboo, is engaging in the role of a little boy facing the fears of childhood.  He has an alcoholic mother and an abusive father.  Godzilla is his guardian of choice, and he's terrified that serial killer Charles Manson will get paroled and come after him.  Leachman is stunning as Gladys, the foul-mouthed granny who loves horror-movies and emphatically warns Booboo to stay out of the nearby cornfields.  She also has a weird sister who has even weirder offspring.
THE FIELDS sets you up for impending horrors, but it's really a coming of age story where real horrors lurk as close as your own bedroom.  The addition of the strange hippie brood suggests more than it actually delivers.

5059183,1,B007726J4U,"Be suspicious of positive reviews from people with a connection or stake in the filming.
Cheap! How can you tell?
(1.) No subtitles for the hearing impaired and others. Noticeable in this case because of poor audio and enunciation by actors.
(2.) Having this opening scene statement, ""Based on true events."" That translates to, ""This is some very large percentage fictionalized.""
(3.) The overused, non-creative, cinematic hook of an overhead view of a car on a winding country road followed by a prolonged shot of a crow landing in front of the camera - acting like a crow.
(4.) The predictable admonition, ""Don't go into the corn fields!""
(5.) Heavy reliance on newspaper and tele scenes of Charles Manson (story set in the '70s) which has nothing to do with the movie. Mentioning his name is suppose to be the scary part of the movie?
(6.) Crux of the movie is that a kid (whose acting consists of a few words and just looking like a cute kid) goes into corn field and sees a dead woman. For some reason can't convince people to go look.
(7.) Usual dumb cop, a portrayal that seems to be a fixture of movies, doesn't bother to walk a hundred yards into the field to check even though there are posters in town of a missing young woman. We never see her die or for that matter see her again.
(8.) Usual dysfunctional family with not very family friendly behaviors by everyone including the kid's grandparents that were portrayed as over-the-top vulgar. Probably the highlight of the movie.
(9.) Local mentally ill person is seen for a few seconds having just hanged himself - wonder why?
(10.) Inconsistent directing/editing goofs. One example: Dad and son are on the roof of a house shooting at a line of cans far away on the ground. Dad shoots a ""Water Putty"" can, then the kid shoots and misses the next can. ""Putty"" can miraculously appears and Dad shoots it again in the exact same way as before.",1340409600,2,1903,4.6
5059184,3,B007726J4U,"The main reason to see the period piece ""The Fields"" is Cloris Leachman. Leachman, an underrated treasure since per days as a performer on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"",""Youn Frankenstein"" and a career that streches back to 1947(!) has experienced a late life career upswing (much deserved by the way)with her wacky comedic performance on ""Raising Hope"".

You need to be warned however that ""The Fields"" really isn't a horror movie but a suspenseful coming-of-action Indie story that focuses on the relationship between a grandmother (Leachman) and her grandson Steven(Joshua Ormond). Set in 1973 in the wake of the Manson murders, ""The Fields"" is a good movie that often stretches for greatness but just misses the mark. That doesn't mean you shouldn't watch ""The Fields""--just adjust your expectations as some of the information out there presents it as a semi-horror movie. What Steven discovers in the fields surrounding his grandparent's farm house colors Steven's world outside of the fields and there is a menance that appears associated with it. Beyond that, I don't want to say too much because I might spoil it for those who like to discover good independent films on their own.

""The Fields"" isn't a perfect film--the pacing is off particularly early on which, in a sense, is good because it doesn't tip the film director's hand but it also might make those who are casually watching the film not pay attention or turn it off as I did initially thinking it was another indie film that was underdelivering on its promise. The casting is also somewhat problematic--while Leachman and her co-star Bev Appleton as Steven's grandfather are terrific in their roles (and Joshua Ormond does quite well in his role as Steven)--Tara Reid who is top billed is truly awful here radiating an amateur quality that damages the film to a small degree.

The ending of the film lacks the kick I had hoped for and plays a bit flat.

The image quality for this DVD is pretty good. Colors look solid and blacks although not quite as solid as I'd like, look decent as well. The detail is quite good although that's a bit lacking in some shots as well.

Audio sounds quite good with an immersive mix that particularly comes to life when Steven is surrounded by the cornstalks swaying in the breeze.

We get a number of featurettes and while they aren't exactly earth shattering, they are quite good--The Making of the Fields, Real Stories & Faces Behind the Film, Hey, No Funny Stuff, Ladies & Gentlemen, Cloris Leachman! and finally a Photo Gallery. There are also a number of trailers for other releases Breaking Class Productions the studio that released ""The Fields"".

More of an atmospheric film that echoes some of the stories of Ray Bradbury or Stephen King stories like ""The Body"" (which was the basis for ""Stand By Me""), ""The Fields"" is an entertaining if flawed film that doesn't quite sustain its suspense consistently and features some weak performances balanced out by a pair of terrific ones given by Leachman and Appleton.

""The Fields"" isn't a great film and that's not a bad thing--there are so many good films out there that get over hyped or get lost in the discussion of what's so special about them that viewers come away disappointed--but a very enjoyable indie feature worth at least a rental. I would just temper your expectations of the film based on what you've heard or read and, if you approach it with adjusted expectations, you'll enjoy investigating ""The Fields"".",1339977600,,3480,4.866554054054054

5059187,3,B007726J4U,"The list of great things in this movie is substantial.  Everything from the locations and music to camera angles and lighting is superb for a modest-budget film (or genre film, really).  And the acting is top-notch.  Cloris Leachman is amazing and it's no exaggeration to say that in a different kind of movie, an Oscar nomination for supporting actress would not be out of the question.  The viewpoint of the film is largely that of 8-year-old Steven, played magnificently by Joshua Ormond.

So why did ""The Fields"" leave me feeling so disappointed?

It comes down to the story, which is a memoir of actual events in the life of scriptwriter Harrison Smith.  And it just doesn't add up to that much.  Don't get me wrong--I don't demand that every movie I see be ""The Avengers.""  I like smaller, quieter movies that focus on relationships and character.  But in a story that amounts to a modified version of the ""home invasion"" horror sub-genre, more must go on than an old couple and a kid being scared and running around.  I almost wished the movie didn't have any horror or thriller elements at all since as a slice-of-life drama, it rose above its material.

Think of it this way: Suppose you got on a roller coaster, and the car chugs high up an incline to the top of the tracks--and then you go down at a leisurely pace with maybe a slight twist here and gentle turn there...but the view is amazing.  That's the case with ""The Fields.""  Everything about the scenery is well-done, but that is one tame ride.

Having said that: MORE LEACHMAN!  Betty White gets all of the old lady parts.  No fair--the 86-year-old Leachman can not only match White's comedic talents, but she clearly has superior dramatic chops (White's cameo in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lake-Placid/dp/B0006HC014/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lake Placid</a>was fun, but she played essentially the same person she always does--whereas Leachman is a revelation in ""Fields"").",1339545600,31,1991,5.095679012345679

My only complaint was that Cloris pronounced Bangor ""Ban-GOR"" instead of how we say it ""Banger,"" especailly since the man playing the father who was sitting next to her is from Bangor. I was like, ""Noooo....Why'd they let her say it like that."" It was unbelievable to hear Kunkletown & Easton mentioned in a nationally-viewed movie. I was expecting a low-budjet film for a 1st time filmmaker, but it wasn't that at all. It's an awesome movie. Please watch & enjoy our beautiful Blue Ridge mts., farmland, blue skies, and creepy old-time amusement park. It's an acuate depiction of events & people. Atmospheric and hystarical! Keeps you enthralled. Thank you, Cloris & Tara for being involved.",1337904000,3,1299,4.71806167400881
5059192,5,B007726J4U,"In this age of Superheroes, glittery vampires and recycled, re-purposed story lines where acting and writing take a back seat to ""who can come up with the coolest CGI,"" occasionally a real film sneaks in.  The Fields is a throwback to when movies actually had substance, superb acting, writing, directing, cinematography, the whole magilla.  I don't recall a suspense film being made in the past 5 years that drew mystery up from the screen like a smoking tendril from the end of a cigarette.  This film does that and more. From the stunning visuals, to the use of imagery though positioning, The Fields is unique. The field, obviously a character in the film is in the present with a crossroads at the opening with a secret.  To the east and west of that secret are two possibilities personified by those who occupy those locations.  Surrounding it are the players - all who have beaten their own paths outside of the stalks that encase a young boy's imagination and curiosity about all of the people who surround him but reach beyond his youthful understanding. Then there's the setting, which to my recollection, has been untapped, the early 1970's coming out of the turmoil of the 1960's following the Manson family's rise to fame. Of particular note, the writing is...well, no words - it's that good.  Dialogue, story, settings - just plain crafted as opposed to some replicated garbage that most Hollywood studios prepare for investors as opposed to the art of filmmaking. What stood out most to me though, was the characters. Not only were they robust, but their interactions were real.  No shortcuts, no convenient props to push them along and force their communications/interactions.  Each character held his/her ground and reacted the way you would expect them too, based on their personalities.  Particularly Bonnie and Barry.  There were times I wanted to shake the hell out of them and tell them to get their acts together and get to parenting! This along with Howard Ford's ""The Dead"" are my favorite films of 2012.  YES - even over the Avengers and every other CGI manufactured story that has been adapted from previous work. Great job cast and crew of ""The Fields!""  Good to know there are still filmmakers out there that care about craft.",1337558400,17,2255,4.859007832898173
5059193,3,B007726J4U,For anyone living in secluded spots in the country think of it...this kind of terror can and has happened to some of them. I have a house hidden from the road where this has happened to me but thankfully for me or for whoever did it I wasn't there at the time. Now this is real terror when you are home at a secluded spot and don't know who or what kind of nuts are outside in your fields terrorizing you. That is scary enough and makes great scary moments in this movie. But in my opinion what distracts from focusing on this terror is the personality of the people and victims  who live in the house. I see no need to go out of the way to show so much of what their personalities are like.(they are kind of nutty).I just though the focus on their quirkiness too much distracts from the terror. Its worth watching but just worry about the terror and don't think too much about the victims nutty personslities.,1336867200,2,910,4.2601156069364166
5059194,5,B007726J4U,"The Fields is a perfect thrill-filled horror flick. There's no gore, no screaming soundtrack, and no naked coeds flashing big new implants at you in 3D - so if you're under say 30, you may not appreciate the style. I, personally, feel this was the scariest film I have seen since the original Chainsaw Massacre ruined countless nights of sleep all those years ago.

Corn fields - the fields they reference here - are some how creepy; always have been. Add to that filming when the corn is gone, and the six foot carcasses of stalk line up to create their own Halloween-worthy forest scape...one's imagination can roam into a frenzied Fearland at the mere thought of a crow taking flight.

That being said, the story goes...It's 1973, and young Steven's (Joshua Ormond) parents are having a few problems. His overseers are too busy suspecting and accusing to allow focus to fall on the youngin'. So, off to grandma's house he goes.

His father's parents' place. This quirky duo is a long-married tough sonovabitch sort. Gladys (Cloris Leachman) is eccentric and delightfully foul-mouthed, in that way many of us recall our own grand parents using the forbidden words as colorful adjectives. Hiney (Bev Appleton) is the sweet grandfather - he still has his post-deviling sparkle twinkling in those old eyes of his though.

Their humble farm rests against a corn field; the kind that, while off-putting, beckons for perusal. Naturally little Steven is drawn in like any horror tale's main character...especially when he is told he better not go in there or he'll end up, as his loving grandma likes to point out, black and bloated and dead.

Faster than you can say, ""Godzilla has attacked Toyk..."" the lad sneaks within.

At this point of the film, you are petrified. All they've done is play some mood-altering music, showed a dysfunctional family's secrets, and reminded you about the Manson trial presently in their headlines.

But, you are there with Steven. He's a curious, smart kid. Still he is a child. He sincerely ponders that this Manson chap could be out and about, taking their exit to get some fresh veggies and whatnots. Sure, Steven is in Pennsylvania, and Manson is behind bars in California - but Steven heard the phrase parole on the radio and that's enough to ignite his nightmares.

Manson aside, something's up, and Steven is tuned in to it. And you're watching all this from his perspective.

The Fields is brilliant. Screenwriter B. Harrison Smith wove a fine freckled fearfest here. Each of the characters is deeply built. Here, you won't find yourself yelling at the kuckudoo-for-brains characters for their stupid reactions; they are scared too - and they listen. You get the feeling the film makers crossed their T's and made sure people in this film were on the ball. From editing, location, clothes, set design - they didn't hand you an, ""Oh come on!"" moment once.

You genuinely winced and begged Steve to get the hell outta there, and when he visits his ""odd"" aunt, you skeeve through the whole section of frames. That's the secret of The Fields' success; continued simple empathetic manipulations of the celluloid canvas before you.

Joshua Ormond (Steven) is simply delightful. His face tells the story, and his ability to share fear is incredible; a lot was on this young actor's shoulders and he pulled off an Atlas-style showing. His parents Tara Reid and Faust Checho are spot on as young adults in a strained marriage. Johnson as Hiney is fabulous. And, let's be frank...I don't adore too many actor folks; one of my personal chickbabe idols, Cloris Leachman is one holding the Royal Flush at this high-stakes table of career-making hands. Leachman wields her ""Gladys"" like she's channeling some lower-middle-class grandma's skeleton-filled closet's soul. And, many of her lines make you bellow aloud towards the screen. Yet, her fear and care for the child are clear as a mosquito tableau in the finest Soviet amber (Watch her and I at The Pirate's of the Caribbean Red Carpet - she does a bit from High Anxiety).

Get this. From The Fields' first atmospheric frame you can just tell this quiet film is gonna scare the bejeesus out of you. The people behind the film have grand futures. And, Joshua Ormond will be walking some red shaded carpets soon; let's hope he has a good support system to avoid his own E! True Hollywood Story special.
