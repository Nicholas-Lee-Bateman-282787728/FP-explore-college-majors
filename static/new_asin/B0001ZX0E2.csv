2047389,5,B0001ZX0E2,"I enjoyed this Thomas video very much. After seeing Steamies V.S. Desiels, I was hoping they would put this one back to normal and the did. The theme song is back to normal, the transitions are back to normal(so no more of those stupid activites), and they got the old director back. All of the stories on this video are good too(stories include:Thomas & the Jet Engine, Percy & the haunted mine, Scaredy engine, Harold & the flying horse, Bulgy rides again, and Salty stormy tale) Even the music video,""boo! boo! choo! choo!"" is good. On a scale of one to ten, I'd give Thomas & the Jet Engine a 10",1090454400,4,599,4.405405405405405

The movie is 35 mins, and this means that the video should be semi-normal. Thank God! Because who the heck gave this liscence to HIT anyway. This video sounds promising! Also, there might not be a music video. But thats okay, because they've gotten pretty dumb.",1085961600,4,512,4.7
2047434,5,B0001ZX0E2,"The subject says it.  My kid loves trains, so we were introduced to the series.  Before the computer animation everything was done with model railroad engines with interchangeable faces and moving eyes.  The special effects were primitive.  It was clever, it was narrated, and a lot of work went in to each episode.  Then it became just another cartoon.  In the early episodes there were great narrators like Ringo Starr and Alec Baldwin.

Similar to the shift of Bob the Builder from claymation - CGI made it worse.",1373846400,,516,4.795454545454546
2047435,5,B0001ZX0E2,"This is a very pleasant video.  Solid story and good animation.  My grandson watches it over and over.  If your little ones love Thomas, they will love this video.",1365120000,,163,4.551724137931035
2047436,4,B0001ZX0E2,"The Thomas & Friends ""stories"" are a staple at our house to ""wind-down"" near bedtime.  We have seen all of them lots of times.",1361232000,,126,4.25
2047437,5,B0001ZX0E2,My sons love Thomas.  Thanks for having such a great selection of children's shows available.  Keep up the good work!,1360627200,,117,4.8
2047438,3,B0001ZX0E2,"I am seriously considering ripping and re-authoring this DVD to take out the unskippable menu of doom - THAT'S how irritating it is. The kid just wants to watch Thomas! We don't need to sit through your 10 minute explanation of EVERY SINGLE MENU ITEM every time! ARGH!!!

That said, this is my son's favorite Thomas DVD. (WHICH MAKES THE MENU ALL THE MORE INFURIATING!)",1345766400,,369,4.676923076923077
2047439,3,B0001ZX0E2,"Pros:
I like the episodes that are on this DVD, so does my 2 year old. There is a Halloween episode, however it doesn't scare my toddler. He's fine with it. Episodes: 5 stars

Cons:
The problem is that the menu plays a cheap animation and literally takes five minutes while it explains what menu buttons you can press... there is no way to skip it and it is infuriatingly long and annoying. EVERY TIME that your child will want to watch this DVD, you will feel angry with the people who designed such a stupid menu. We have a lot of the other Thomas and Friends videos with easy menus to get through. Menu: 0 stars (Grrr!)",1342396800,2,622,4.271186440677966
2047440,5,B0001ZX0E2,"This item is now discontinued, so I was thrilled when a brand new one was offered.  It was as offered:  original, unopened and great quality.  The price was so small it actually cost more (which wasn't much) to ship.  My granddaughter loved it.  Grandma Pat",1272499200,,257,4.622222222222222

2047442,1,B0001ZX0E2,"When you read the title of this dvd you don't except it will have Halloween stories in it. That is just what it contained and I would prefer if the dvd producers would have given it a title to suggest that those types of episodes are on it so that those wanting to avoid those kind of stories would do so easily. If you don't want Halloween type of episodes of Thomas, then don't buy this dvd.",1244505600,4,393,4.116883116883117
2047443,2,B0001ZX0E2,"You may be buying this DVD for a toddler. If you are, be prepared for the longest preamble in DVD history. What are the producers thinking?

2047464,1,B0001ZX0E2,"I rented this DVD for my 2 year old who loves all the Thomas movies.  Unfortunately, this one had several scary episodes about ghosts, Halloween, etc.  The night after he watched watched it, he screamed and shouted ""GHOST!"".  It made me sad to realize that Thomas had introduced something scary to him so unneccessarily.  I'm glad I only rented it, but I wish I would have avoided it altogether.",1188000000,4,395,4.681159420289855

2047466,4,B0001ZX0E2,"This is another enjoyable DVD for any young children who enjoy the Thomas shows or playing with Thomas wooden or plastic train sets.  It has 6 short episodes to keep it just over 30 minutes, which is much better than those 90 or 2 hour ones that are simply way too long for little ones to sit through.  Also, there are two spooky episodes just in time for Halloween, one is Percy and the Haunted Mine, which is doesn't deal directly with Halloween, but has it's share of spooky night scenery, and the Scaredy Engines episode which follows, that is about Halloween.  You get the usual extras with a few games and sing-alongs.  Check out Thomas' Snowy Surprise for the Christmas themed episodes.",1155254400,2,693,4.609756097560975
2047467,2,B0001ZX0E2,The first time the kids watched it they didn't mind the verbal descriptions in the menu. Subsequent viewings were very annoying because you can't jump past the menu to watch the movies. They won't watch it any more.,1131840000,4,215,4.684210526315789
2047468,2,B0001ZX0E2,"I have to say that I am getting rather tired of these rather short compilations where there are always at least 1 or 2 stories that are available on several other DVD's/Video's

The Jet Engine in particular is on at least 3 DVD's my son already has, it seems a shame that they cant have at least 1 exclusive episode per dvd - its not like they don't have YEARS worth of episodes to pick from.

With that said, I feel I have to strongly disagree as regards some of the other comments about this being too scary for 2 year olds - my son ( 2years old) has been watching Thomas for quite some time now and has never found ANY of the ghost based stories frightening - any child who is scared at this age of something like this is obviously not getting the right love and attention at home.

If your child already has a healthy Thomas collection then I'm sure that if you have a look you will find ALL these episodes are already present on other compilations - steer clear.

If you have just started buying Thomas DVD's/Video's for your child then this will be a welcome addition.

As for the accents for Donald and Douglas, they are laughable to say the least (especially if like me you happen to be from Scotland )",1117670400,2,1210,4.2663755458515285
2047489,2,B0001ZX0E2,"Thomas is usually a big hit in our house, but this DVD is way to scary for my two year old son. He got frighten and came running into my arms. It will be awhile until I attempt to play this DVD again.",1107129600,2,200,3.6744186046511627
2047490,4,B0001ZX0E2,"My two year old loves this DVD---and I mention this because he's the only Thomas connoisseur in our house.  He doesn't seem to notice the same idiosyncracies that I do as I'm listening along.  For instance, the problem I find is that Sir Topham Hatt's voice sounds different from story to story.  I like this Brandon character on the whole (sounds kind of Mike Myers-y.  However, the lack of continuity in the tenor of the voices bothers me.  Also, Bulgy sounds different from moment to moment.  Mind you, my little fellow is hooked and could not care less, but as most responsible TV parents know, if your kid watches it, you do too!",1097971200,2,634,4.566371681415929
2047491,4,B0001ZX0E2,I have gone on and on about how much I hate the new Thomas movies but Steamis vs. Diesels was something else. I was expecting nothing from this one but I really was suprised. They reinstaded the theme song and the intermissions and put Alec Baldwin back (Wasn't too happy about that). The stories were good but people watching with the toddler who is watching will be quite bored. Thomas has changed quite a bit but I think Hit Entertainment is on the right track to fiking the problems. This is a sure hit for your kids but pop in an earlier one if you want to stay awake during it as well.,1096070400,,591,4.238938053097345
2047492,3,B0001ZX0E2,"My 3-year old, who has seen many other Thomas videos/DVDs was really scared by this one - ""The Spooky Mine"" and ""Scaredy Engines"" were too much for him.  He doesn't even want to watch it again, and based on his initial reaction, I don't want him to watch it again either.",1093996800,4,271,4.313725490196078

8019083,1,B0001ZX0E2,"This is a bait and switch. The preview is basically the entirety of the Jet engine part of the story. Then it's a series of short ""spooky"" Thomas and Friends shorts that are designed to subtly impart fear to your little ones. I'm so grieved by the lack of discernment in parents today. Why do you think this is ok? This would be the perfect way to introduce scary themes to your kids so that they are insecure about their room at night or their closet. Even better, if your a grandparent, you won't have to deal with the fallout because the kids' parents will be the ones comforting them the middle of the night later after you send your grandkids home with mom and dad. This movie is just weird and the title and description is just bait. Know what you're getting into.",1518393600,,770,4.354166666666667

8019085,5,B0001ZX0E2,Exactly as advertised.  These classic DVDs are great.  I love how the production looks like a parent playing with an awesome model railroad layout and telling their child a story.  I think that is why children love these.,1486857600,,221,4.7631578947368425
