8415763,5,B00443WWPA,"Very nice review of the event and what makes the event happen. One has to understand that it is a significant enough event that those invited to compete and ride the big waves at Waimea fly in and wait until the breaks are big enough to hold the Eddie, and to also know that it just may not happen at all.  It is an event of great significance and this DVD provides all the insight into the significance of this event.",1299628800,2,418,4.160493827160494
