4190229,1,B003T9YANM,poor bad editing! the worst dvd box set i have ever had. discs stacked on top of each other in a box with a plastic key totally sucks go suck an egg gozilla!!!,1357257600,,159,3.8484848484848486
4190230,2,B003T9YANM,"This is by no means a licensed production.  Photocopied outer sleeve, printed sticker labels on DVDs.  No inner sleeve - - no history or information of the show.  You could easily pick up something of the same quality or better in your neighborhood Chinatown.  Don't expect much.

That said, the image quality is okay.  It's not so bad that it looks like someone recorded from a tv playing a vhs, but not much better than watching a vhs tape.  It's far below what you would expect from a licensed dvd release.  I wasn't expecting a digitally-remastered, HD video, but I was expecting a bit more than this.  Disappointing.

The only upside I can see is that each episode is represented and preserved on dvd, so what quality there is will not deteriorate over time.",1357171200,2,763,4.626865671641791
4190231,4,B003T9YANM,"I remember seeing the movie compilation of this series when I was young. I've been waiting to revisit it. Giant Robot does not disappoint. Quality of picture and sound are to be expected as this series is from the 60's. All in all, this blast from the past is worth the money.",1344643200,3,276,4.326923076923077
4190232,4,B003T9YANM,This is a Great DVD! I'm so happy to have it. But there are two things about it I don't like. My Ultraman DVD's Have an audio select for English and Japanese and Johnny Robo don't. That's one. The other is the advertising of the seller of the DVD. But you can fast forward it. Other than that it's still good enough to have but don't lose the wheel lock to secure your DVD's in the case.,1340928000,3,387,4.038961038961039
4190233,3,B003T9YANM,"I purchased this box set after reading the review by ""Citizen Joe"" and other bad reviews of another box set being sold. Citizen Joe's review is spot on so read it for more detailed information.

4190234,4,B003T9YANM,"If you grew up in the 80's then you'll love to relive this show. The whole series has been remastered on the first 7 DVD's. The only down side is that the 8th DVD, (the movie) is not remastered. There are also some audio drop out in one episode and a few others have added seens that where deleted for commerical time or content, that are replace in their original Japanees.",1310774400,13,374,4.28169014084507
4190235,3,B003T9YANM,"I purchased this box set after reading the horrible reviews on the other box set being sold.
I was very cautious about my expectations. Gozilla is an independent company and the claim of ""digital remastered"" did have me doubting.  When the package arrived I was in for a good surprise. The packaging is well done and the 8 discs are well secured in the single case. The image quality was a lot better than expected. It is true that it is not 1080HD but Gozilla made a very good effort in enhancing and improving the original prints on each episode.
While some artifacts remain the image itself is very clean, sharper and the colors are bright and balanced.
Occasionally the sound levels drop but not a big deal.  I recommend this to anyone since there are only a couple box sets available and I do not think the full collection will ever be officially released by any major studios.
Note: On each episode the Gozilla logo flashes in and out in the lower corner, not a major issue but wish it was left off of the actual episodes.  Maybe a company spot in between each episode would be better.

This box set not only includes the entire series run but the movie Voyage Into Space. This set also includes bonus Ultraman and Spectreman episodes on disc 07.",1300320000,42,1252,4.502202643171806

We don't allow much TV, but this is a pretty safe bet these days. It's comical the English voiceover Japanese video! My kid doesn't even notice that, but he sure does love the show! All the seasons in one package (I think 4).
Watching this during holiday season brought back a lot of memories and stories with older family members who were in town and kind of bridged the gap between older and youngest generations. It was cool.",1514851200,,437,4.544303797468355

4190240,5,B003T9YANM,"I got this as a Christmas gift and binge watched it.

Is it reckless? Of course

Is it energetic and full of goofy fun? Oh yes it is CRAMMED with it!

Is it worth watching? No...it's worth DEVOURING every bit of it. (Watching is too kind a word)

This was one of the most entertaining romps I've enjoyed in years. The story is for children, but even 53 year old kids like me can enjoy the surreal and off the wall story. I had heard sop much about the show I thought I'd be interested in a few episodes and then move on because I'd get bored or just lose interest.

It never happened and my interest never waned.

I love the fact the show has a beginning and an end, and one of the best endings to a show I have ever seen. Special effects are good, the monsters Giant Robot fights look cool, and the dubbing is not distracting. The show has now gotten me interested in other shows of the type from Japan, and I'm about to explore the genre soon..
If you are a fan of this type of stuff you will like this show.",1513641600,,1010,4.050251256281407

4190244,4,B003T9YANM,"The image quality is about as I remember it from when I watched this as a young boy.  The opening and end credits are scratched and grainy, while the first episode is a little battered.  After that the following episodes are fairly clear, but the image is a little soft, and by that I don't mean focus, but there's a kind of fuzzy color bleed to all objects.  I'm not sure why that is.

The amount of gun violence is enormous, but for all that the kids who grew up with this kind of material didn't make headlines with mass shootings.  I think kids get the idea of violence and have a good message that violence is bad hammered home to them in old fashioned shows like these.

The giant robot is a welcomed old friend.  Not as dynamic as Ultraman or Spectreman, he has his own kind of charm, and is true to the Japanese kaiju genre by having all kinds of devices and weapons at his disposal.

To me this show is strictly nostalgia fare.  I'm not sure how today's young kids might take to it, but it seems like the kind of show that would do well if it were made today.",1509667200,4,1068,4.170731707317073

4190250,5,B003T9YANM,"This show is really a lot of fun.  I didn't get to grow up with the show, but even as a middle age adult, I enjoy.  If you liked the Godzilla movies and Ultraman as a kid, you'll probably be charmed by this set.  I love how Giant Robot barks his confirmation of orders that the little kid gives him.  The heroes always seem to be in real danger, and some people are shot and killed.  Not something I'd expect of a kids show from so long ago.

4190287,1,B003T9YANM,"I didn't expect the image quality to be great but this is almost beyond bad and is responsible for my poor review of this item.  The image on screen often looks like a lot of blotchy blocks (is this what they mean by artifacting?).  Sure you could make out what was happening, but it was hard to enjoy the clarity of such a graded image.  The sound wasn't great but what do you expect from a mono track?  Sometimes tinny.  What was a bit of a problem on later eps was that it jumped to Japanese dialogue and then flipped back to the English dub.  The other downer was that the company, Gozilla, frequently inserted their logo at the bottom of the screen.  It was easy to get used to at least.

This product comes in a large case that holds 8 stacked DVDs, all labeled.  Each DVD (except the last two) contain 4 eps.  There aren't individual chapters to the single eps.  Chapters are essentially divided by the episodes themselves.  The 7th disc concludes the series and also has two bonus features on it (the first episode of Ultraman and another of Spectreman.  That was a nice and unexpected bonus.  The final disc is the cobbled together movie that many people grew up on just as I did, Voyage Into Space.  I have a VHS copy of VIS that Ill keep because the picture is better.

If anyone is unfamiliar with what this series is about?  Its a pure boys adventure tale of sci-fi fantasy flight.  Young Johnny Sokko (where were his parents) is recruited into becoming a Unicorn agent (one of the good guys) when he ends up being the first voice that the atomic Giant Robot hears and from then on forever obeys.  Sokko and his other Unicorn compatriot battle the evil and otherworldly Gargoyle Gang who are bent on world domination and destruction.  They constantly unleash wild giant monsters (like the freaky deaky floating eyeball!) that Giant Robot handily dispatches.  The villains, in silver painted body suits and with garish bulbed foreheads and severely sideways jacked teeth are almost painfully comical.  Remember that this was a Japanese kids TV show and the budget often was spent on explosions so the costumes and cardboard sets are brightly colored but are also sparse and not lived in or filled out.  The show is especially violent with lots of hand-to-hand chop sockey combat and gunfire.  Theres even a little blood from time to time though nothing gruesome.  Still, given that the target audience seems to be little boys between the ages of 6-16 the violence can be a bit much for especially the younger viewers.  But one thing not to worry about: the villains are clearly drawn as such as are the good guys easily identifiable.  No moral quandaries there.

As I never grew up with the TV show but only the movie Id give the series 3.5 stars simply for the weirdness and creativity.  Some of the monsters that they came up with were just crazy and Giant Robot himself with is funky middle eastern/ Arabian look is just so cool.  But the plots are redundant, the effects decent at times and sub-par at others, and the acting pretty stiff and characters one-dimensional.  But while thats not great for a kids TV show, its also not necessarily a bad thing for a crazy kids fantasy from back in the 1960s either.  What is bad is the product image.  I don't know how bad the other product is (you can get this set from Shout! Factory too) but its hard to believe that its worse than this.",1438819200,4,3400,4.5394736842105265
4190288,1,B003T9YANM,"Back in 1999 or 2000, I bought the entire series ON VHS, if you can imagine that.  It came in a box with 12 VHS tapes.  The quality was what you'd expect on VHS, but I still enjoyed watching them, I mean it was pretty much as I watched them as a kid on a crappy UHF channel on an old 70s television set.  On these VHS tapes, there are even portions of the episodes that play in Japanese briefly and then switch back to English, but I didn't care.  So for years I was hoping the long-awaited DVD or even blu-ray would fix those issues but it appears from what I'm reading in the comments that those issues still exist.  Therefore I'll wait until a better dvd or blu-ray set is offered.",1438819200,,684,4.112781954887218
4190289,5,B003T9YANM,"First off no I didn't buy this DVD collection from Amazon or anywhere else actually. I read some of the reviews here earlier. One of these reviews included that this DVD set can be seen on Hulu. And the quality visually on Hulu is better than the disk set sold here. I only watched as a kid a 90 minute Johnny Sokko Flying Robot movie back in the late 1960's. I was blown away to actually see lots of episodes available of this Flying Robot. Each episode is 25 minutes on Hulu and look very good in quality considering the age of the series. So I give Johnny Sokko's Flying Robot 5 stars for the Hulu version. I wouldn't want to buy the DVD sets offered because of so many poor reviews on those. I seen 15 episodes so far on Hulu on this series. And honestly I used for years only think Giant Robot had Finger Rockets, Eye Beams and Fire breath. But Giant Robot actually has a few extra powers as I seen on some of the 15 episodes so far.

My only reason not to give it a full 5 stars, one of the discs had a scratch that caused two of the episodes to freeze up and jump. I considered sending the set back, but I believe I can actually fix the scratch.",1423526400,2,475,4.409090909090909

4190305,5,B003T9YANM,"You know what?  I am a big fan of this genre.  I have episodes of shows you guys may never heard of.  However Most of those are not available outside of a convention and those are what I call rough.  Some are unwatchable, but you get what you pay for and you definitely take what you can get.  I originally watched Johnny Sokko, Space Giants, Spectreman, and Ultraman on channel a UHF  44 in the Chicago area, on a TV with an antenna.  So the quality on these discs is quite good comparing to what I was dealing with.  Maybe we are too used to super duper HD TVs with digital quality, to actually remember the way we had it back then.  I find these to be very well done.  So if you want to watch this show and add it to your collection by all means buy this, because the only alternative is buy a copy someone made and it will not be this good.  And if it is a transfer from a lazerdisc, the quality might be better, but it won't be dubbed which is what many of us here in the states remember.  And I do remember the flying hand scene.

4190311,5,B003T9YANM,"First off, I totally disagree with the reviewers who say the picture is out of focus. I noticed, initially, that it seemed as if the picture was stretched. Knowing that our HD TVs are capable of so many options, I went through and tweaked the presentation. There was an option that automatically stretch the picture past the viewing area a bit to hide edges and artifacts. I turned that off and the very little stretching I noticed was gone.

The picture and audio quality are tremendous as well! Outside of the standard title card for each episode, there are very few scratches on the picture. SHOUT Factory did a masterful job with this release!

As for the show itself, I thoroughly enjoyed it! I had seen clips of the show here and there at G-Fest the last three years, but never watched any full episodes until I purchased this set. I enjoyed this more than I anticipated. Having the show dubbed in English was a pleasant surprise as I was expecting Japanese language with English subtitles. Which would have been fine if that was the case as most of the Tokusatsu shows I own are as such (i.e. ""Iron King,"" Red Baron,"" and ""UltraSeven."").

Johnny and his Agent friend Jerry (a relationship that was fun then, creepy  now) save the world by fighting off aliens and their monsters. Johnny is actually issued a gun and he shoots bad guys dead. Not something you would see in today's children's programming. The giant robot is just that, and through the silliest plot device ever, is controlled by Johnny only. Its progression throughout the episodes actually gives the series a philosophical lesson in robot awareness. Johnny is smart and independent. 2 qualities we would like  children to possess.

  destroying them both.

 23) Dr. Engali, Master of Evil
  U7, member of Japan Branch of Unicorn, is the one who controls the gigantic GIANT ROBO with the wrist-watch controller

  Johnny is shot by a very careless assassin, and Emperor Guillotine pulls out all the stops, throwing his three remaining
  monsters at Giant Robot. Guillotine then grows to an incredible size and declares himself ruler of the world. Giant Robot
  can't defeat him, because Guillotine is made of atomic energy and traditional attacks would 'splode the entire world
  (Chief Azuma's words). Will Giant Robot make the ultimate sacrifice to save the planet and Johnny?

P.S.  I read through a bunch of the other reviews.  I am wondering if this is the same set.  It is put out by shout but I have none of the blurry images they complain about.

4190335,4,B003T9YANM,"I was frightened of this show when I was a kid.

Back in my grade school days in the early 1970s, a local TV station aired Ultraman  and Johnny Sokko back to back. I always liked Ultraman, but I remember thinking Johnny Sokko was scary and I didn't watch it as much.

Im glad its recent release on DVD has given me a chance to revisit the shows 26 episodes nearly 40 years later. Its an entertaining, if kiddish, adventure romp which probably has both Godzilla and Power Rangers somewhere in its lineage.

The series starts with the arrival via multicolored spaceship of  Emperor Guillotine, a blue-faced bulbous-headed alien (its a bad mask with painted eyes) here to conquer the earth. After making some threats and shooting down a few futuristic jet fighters, his ship  settles to the bottom of the ocean. Its from there that he directs his nefarious activities, which each involves the efforts of a commander serving the emperor and a giant monster the Robot ultimately has to fight.

An oft-repeated word here is Gargoyle. Its supposedly the name of Guillotines home planet; one of the lamest monsters of the show is called the Gargoyle Vine (Satan Rose in the original Japanese airing); and Guillotines minions are known as The Gargoyle Gang. (Theres also a bad guy called Harlequin, and I think its interesting that this Japanese-produced series is so enamored of French words.)

Anyway, next enters 10-year old Johnny Sokko, whos traveling on an ocean liner, apparently without parents or adult supervision. He meets a young man named Jerry Mono, who is an agent with a secret group called the Unicorn International Peace Organization. Their ship is sunk by the first giant monster Guillotine unleashes and they wash ashore on the island which just happens to be where the Gargoyles are building a giant robot to help the emperor take over the earth.  A scientist who the Gargoyles are forcing to build the robot helps our heroes and Johnny ends up being the first voice the robot hears upon activation and therefore, his sole controller. As a result, Johnny becomes part of Unicorn and Jerry and Johnny become the premiere team sent to investigate Gargoyle incursions around the world.

Theres no real background about Johnny or any explanation about where his parents are, although in a later episode, you see him in school and playing with some other kids. Since he directs the robot in battle, I also wonder where little Johnny learned battle strategy and about the robots capabilities (and why adults would trust him with the very fate of mankind).

The show displays its cheapness in the fact that just about every monster, no matter how spectacularly it was destroyed the first time,  makes a return appearance, sometimes redressed, sometimes not, as the series goes on. Only one of the monsters is a quadruped, most are bipedal, and then theres things like Opticon, which sounds like an optometrist convention, and looks like a giant flying eyeball.

Unlike Ultraman, the monsters aren't the emphasis in Sokko, but instead the parade of bad guys serving Guillotine provide a lot of the entertainment. Most look like they could have fallen out of a comic book, some are recurring, and some are in a single episode. None have any character development - they're just bad because they're bad and they all grovel before Guillotine.

My favorite baddie would have to be Space Mummy, who is in only one episode and has a rather gruesome appearance. Dressed in a trenchcoat and hat and with bandages covering most of his face, his most defining characteristic is his demented high-pitched almost sing-songy voice.

Another favorite is Dr. Botanus, who is bald and has a silver face and who reminds me of Destro from G. I. Joe. Botanus, however, has shelf-like eyebrows and impeccable fashion sense with his yellow shirt and black shawl with its yellow stitching. His English voice line delivery reminds me of Agent Smith  from The Matrix and he has the ability to teleport.

The bad guy I remember most from watching this show as a kid is Fangar, who has a large forehead, excessively protruding upper teeth, a black and white striped outfit with a red cape, and a crutch. Its obvious hes turned to crime just so he can finance his badly needed oral surgery and other medical needs!

Theres a slew of other commanders, including Spider, Dr. Snake, The Golden Knight, the Executioner, Metron the Spaceman, Dr. Eingali, and Dr. Hydra,

The shows score frequently employs some jazz, but the robots theme music sounds like a cross between a national anthem and some old Italian band music. Theres also a whistled version, usually used when the robot is fighting a monster, and which would not be out of place in a spaghetti western.

Similarities between Johnny Sokko and Ultraman include: both teams have an outwardly gruff but ultimately warmhearted commander; the helmets and uniforms are similar; the team includes both a young woman and a boy; and their adventures include studio shots, model work, and live action shots in and around 1960s Tokyo.

Sokkos Unicorn team comes to include a very young girl named Mari, who becomes the groups communications officer. She is vaguely Shirley Templeish and her English voice is way too sweet.

Iconic Sokko images youll see over and over include red-striped missiles loading into place in the robots fingers, angled shots of the characters as they fly around with their jet packs, the robot flying out of the Unicorn headquarters building, and a tight shot of the robots megapunch from the monsters point of view.

The stories get more complicated and emotionally involving as the shows one season progresses. One that I found particularly suspenseful was the second to last episode (Drakulon - Creature of Doom) in which our young heroes are surrounded by a town full of vampires with the biggest fangs youve ever seen.

The show also occasionally touches on some still-topical subjects, including oil dependance on the middle east, biological weapons, and the arms race.

When it initially aired, the Johnny Sokko was criticized for excessive violence. Theres probably a lot of things in here you couldn't do on television nowadays. The young hero and other children brandish and use pistols often, the baddies frequently mow people down with machine guns, and Johnny and company are frequently put into peril. Theres very seldom any blood shown, and when it is, it looks like it was poured on and no wounds are visible.

Theres no extras at all on the Johnny Sokko DVD set (not even subtitles), but the video quality itself seems better than the Ultraman set which came out a few years ago.

The only thing I find scary now about Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot is that I was once afraid of it!",1391040000,,6752,4.869109947643979

4190338,5,B003T9YANM,"BOTTOM LINE: Dated and childish, but in the best way. JOHNNY SOKKO is a great Japanese TV series from the 'good old days' that still manages to charm and delight the young and young at heart. This Shout! Factory DVD release of JOHNNY SOKKO AND HIS FLYING ROBOT is a mixed blessing though. This basic DVD set is likely to be the only shot at a legit R1 release for this show we'll get, so I guess we have to take what we can get. 5 STARS for the classic, action & monster-packed series itself, (but only 3 STARS for the so-so DVD presentation).

THE STORY: In the not too distant the future, a young boy accidentally gains control of a 100ft tall robot which was originally designed & constructed as a weapon of terror for those sinister intergalactic meanies, The Gargoyle Gang, and their squid-headed leader, that ruthless space tyrant, Emperor Guillotine. Under the mastery of young Johnny, Giant Robo instead becomes a defender of mankind. Johnny & Robo sign on with the United Nations Investigative Criminal Organization Response Network, (that's UNICORN to you & me), and together with his crime-fighting, spy-in-disguise partner Jerry Mano (aka Agent U3 ), 10 year-old Johnny guides Giant Robot's formidable atomic-powered strength & impressive array of built-in weaponry into combat against an army of wildly bizarre monsters from Planet Gargoyle to defend our Earth! When you think about it, this show was a fairly clear prototype/pre-cursor for Guillermo Del Toro's 2013 big budget 'Bots-n-Beasties mash-up, PACIFIC RIM!

THOUGHTS: I think JOHNNY SOKKO AND HIS FLYING ROBOT is a great if somewhat silly show. Just keep in mind when the series was made and who its intended audience was. While it most definitely shows its age when viewed through modern eyes, its big heart & sense of bold adventure shine throughout. Johnny is your average good-natured kid who finds himself plunged into an incredible world of mystery, danger, and bizarre alien beings intent on enslaving mankind and colonizing the Earth. Kids are amazingly adaptable types and young Johnny takes the weirdness all in stride, teaming with the good guys of UNICORN in order to Atomic Punch those space jerks all the way back to Planet Gargoyle, where they belong. The various colorful villains of The Gargoyle Gang are one of the show's biggest strengths: unique, inspired and totally over the top. There's Nazi-wannabe Spyder (and his seemingly indestructible sidekick Piranha), the orthodontically-challenged Fangar, acne-nightmare Dr. Snake, the double-crossing 3-eyed Metron from Andromeda, the ghoulish Space Mummy, lumpy-skinned Dr. Engali (from the 5th dimension of Evil!), cosplay reject Harlequin ...and the baddest of the bunch, the creepy, chrome-domed Doctor Botanus. By comparison the agents of UNICORN come off as a boring bunch of one-dimensional squares. But hey! they're the good guys, right? So we'll stick with 'em. As the series progresses Johnny becomes emotionally attached to Giant Robot, forming a deep psychological bond to the big metal lug; one which sees the mismatched pair through many a hair-raising predicament. Being an older Japanese-created series, JOHNNY SOKKO AND HIS FLYING ROBOT is filled with legitimate life & death situations for young Johnny and tons of gory violence that would send modern Action for Children's Television members into apoplectic fits. Surprisingly however, there are also moments of genuine misty-eyed emotion sprinkled throughout this 26 episode kids' show. And if, like me, you first watched this as a youngster then I doubt you'll be able to hold back the tears during the heart-breaking series finale. The memorable climax was copied almost verbatim some 30 years later in Brad Bird's outstanding animated film THE IRON GIANT.

THE DVD SET: Well, the good news is that, FINALLY, the complete JOHNNY SOKKO series has arrived on DVD. The bad news is that the sourced ""masters"" Shout! Factory used are what MGM had sitting in their vaults. (The self-same masters that Fox Home Releasing deemed unsatisfactory for them to use for their proposed manufactured-on-demand home release.) After languishing for almost two years, the pop culture genre hounds at Shout! Factory stepped in and sub-licensed JS&HFR. If not for them this show would likely still be sitting in a vault somewhere collecting dust. It's too bad they didn't cough up the cash to obtain original source materials from Toei Studios, but the strangely complicated world of international licensing just didn't make it feasible. The video portion is a mixed bag: the English-language opening titles are pretty awful-looking while the actual episodes themselves are decent, though truthfully only marginally better than many bootleg sets which routinely pop up on eBay. Audio is strong & level though a little 'crackly' due to age. (Special mention to the jazzy, James Bond-ian tinged soundtrack, which was mercifully left intact by the American International Pictures dubbing team.) Speaking of which, the English language dub is your only audio language choice and there are no subtitles. Also please note that with the exception of some excellent liner notes by Japanese SPFX historian & guru August Ragone there are no extras. If you want this boxset then my advice is to pick it up used and save yourself some $$$.",1388966400,2,5318,5.181395348837209

Too many English attempts to understand this incredible genre of imported entertainment as ""bad-movie"" or ""cheesy"" fun have REALLY missed the mark on the incredible legacy of Japan's entertainment industry and culture. This fact is what makes it even more disappointing that the unedited versions of these episodes, as they were first shown on TV in Japan, were not included.

4190351,5,B003T9YANM,"OK, lots of people saying the video transfer is rough. My experience is, the opening credits are very rough, but the rest of the episodes aren't too bad.

Which is a very relative judgment, I admit. They look OK on my computer, to me.

Except the credits, which are, indeed, pretty rough. And do, indeed, appear to cut out a half second or so early.

OK. So.

As I recall from my youth... my extreme youth, having been about 7 at the time... the opening credits, here in America, anyway, were _always_ rough.

I find the transfers, at the very least, acceptable. Even though there are some rough edges.

And... and my review may very well be tainted by this... I've wanted this series, and be able to relive my youth, for a very long time. Decades.

That I finally actually do have this series in my collection, to me, anyway, is a blessing. I can't believe that I had forgotten, for example, the flying hand -- but as soon as I saw it in these DVDs I was exclaiming, ""Oh yeah! It's THAT one!"". Just like my 7 year old self did, 40 some years ago. And, amazingly, to me, almost the same excitement.

Not that I recalled a lot of details, but...

So many memories. Good memories. Of my youth. Of watching this before school. And talking to my friends about the episode that was shown that morning.

All of us watched Johnny Sokko before we went to school, and we all wanted a flying giant robot of our own, when we were seven.

And even on the what might have been the 100th re-run, well, by that time we were going ""Oh, it was the flying hand again"". And it was still fun to watch, and fun to talk about. It was still a shared experience.

I suppose, if you're a purist who wants nothing but clean, pristine, copies, this isn't for you.

If you're a little boy grown into middle age (or girl... I suspect there are very few female Sokko fans, because this was long before that sort of thing happened... not that it couldn't happen and rightfully and wonderfully so!) who watched this as a youth who wants to recapture a bit of that, this simply can't be beat.

Is it perfect video transfers? Nope.

Buy it anyway. You either ""get it"", and it's important to you, or you don't. If you ""get it"", you won't care about the transfer quality of the opening credits.

Which as I honestly recall were not that great, even back in the day.",1374192000,19,2329,4.319540229885058

4190362,5,B003T9YANM,"As an adult, I watch way too much television. Most of what I watch is garbage and will have no influence on my life other than to have wasted my time. Amazingly, as a child, I also watched way too much television. Having said that, I look at each of the shows I watched as a kid and so many of them are classics. Sure, all the Warner Brothers cartoons (and others like Tom & Jerry, The Pink Panther...), M*A*S*H (and other sitcoms like Mary Tyler Moore, Brady Bunch...), Carol Burnett Show (and other variety shows), etc., etc., There were so many others and I feel so fortunate (let me repeat that - SO FORTUNATE) to have late 1970's and 1980's television to focus on (to the exclusion of the rest of my life).

Of all the shows I associate with my childhood, two stand out - 1) Star Blazers - an animated cartoon (early Japanese anime) about a group from Earth making a long journey to a planet called Iscandar in order to save the Earth, 2) Johnny Sokko and his Flying Robot - a young boy gets to control a massive flying robot to fight other massive monsters in an effort save the earth.

Evidently, saving the earth was a big deal to me and obviously was going to be what I would do as an adult. Now, I monitor television broadcasting to protect and serve in my own way.

Getting back to my childhood and Johnny Sokko, I was so thrilled when I saw this was coming to DVD. I've waited nearly forty years to get my hands on this set. On the positive side, the picture quality is really very good given the age of the source material. During the opening sequence before each show, you can see how terrible both the audio and video are. Fortunately, there has clearly been a audio/video clean-up for the actual episodes.

I highly recommend this collection to anyone who has ever seen this show because if you've ever seen it, you'll want to see more. Enjoy",1367366400,2,1858,4.345821325648415

That being said, it's about time.  Contradiction much?  I'll say, but once again, it's not entirely what I mean.  This is about A time.  A time in my life where things were fanciful, silly, endlessly enjoyable and ""real"".  When I was a young boy and my eye caught an ad on TV that this would be ""coming soon"", I stopped everything I was doing to plan ahead for the viewing.  In the pre-VCR days, we watched what they put on, when they put it on.  In so doing they created a community.  The next day after the airing, ALL of my friends were talking about it with great flights of fancy interjected into that day's play.  If only we could go back to a time when innocence and imagination were combined with a communal outcome of sharing and reliving.

The effects were cheesy as hell but as a kid I was so mesmerized by the story of Johnny Sokko and his Giant Robot.

4190366,3,B003T9YANM,"The complaints that others are referring to about this particular release of ""Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot"" are valid. I, for one, am very happy to have an official release of this series to go with my dvd's of ""Ultraman"" vol 1 and 2, ""Iron King"", ""UltraSeven"" and ""Super Robot Red Baron"". But the transfers, focusing on audio and video, miss the mark in many places. For starters, the intro for the show is absolutely horrible and looks like an old EP vhs tape with grain, dirt and not remastered at all; and it is the same for each episode. Second, Shout! Factory should be ashamed or not getting the original Japanese language tracks and adding some subtitles. The old English dub may be campy and nostalgic for others but very hard to deal with for others. The English dubs erase any sense of authenticity to the series. Shout! Factory did a good job with UltraSeven so I don't get it. Maybe this released was rushed or something. The video quality of the episodes in not that great, neither consistent with some being good and some shabby. The packaging is very well done and the booklet is a big plus. I do give Kudos for Shout! Factory even releasing this legendary tokusatsu show in the states. But a little more care into the audio and video would have been well appreciated. Overall, this release does garnish a purchase. It is worth buying if you are a collector of Ultraman, Gojira, Gamera, tokusatsu. It is a very nice box set to add to your library. NOW, SHOUT!FACTORY WOULD YOU PLEASE GET THE RIGHTS TO ""ZONE FIGHTER"" AND RELEASE THIS SERIES ON DVD AND/OR BLU-RAY AS WELL...AND THANK YOU!!!

I would've been very surprised if these were re-mastered because not everybody knows about this series. They are so old, they're probably beyond repair and would be too expensive to restore. Look at the Bruce Lee movies, to this day the studio still haven't re-stored those movies and everybody knows about Bruce Lee. So I really can't complain about the video quality. I just happy they finally released an official DVD version that will last forever or until the next video format comes out. A true fan really wouldn't mine.

4190372,3,B003T9YANM,"A few years ago, digitally remastered, complete eps of Johnny Sokko, began airing on Hulu.  They looked good, but were high pitched.  Furthermore, the opening sequence began sort of abruptly, cutting off the first second and a half or so.  Finally, at the end of each episode, there was no preview sequence, showing clips from the next episode. Those of us who remember the show, and who were fortunate enough to own bootlegs, remember this little preview sequence, quite well.

When a dvd release of this series was announced, I assumed it was going to be put together, using the same source elements as the episodes on Hulu, and I was right.  Same pitch problem, same opening sequence, and no previews sequence.  But there was one other problem.  Unfortunately, SHOUT FACTORY goofed in the printing process of some of the episodes, and got the focus out of whack, as some people have observed.  So, in that respect, what you see on Hulu is actually BETTER than the DVD release.

So, here's what I suggest.  If you can't simply capture the eps from Hulu, then buy the DVDs.  If you can, then don't.  Unfortunately, my current computer doesn't allow me to capture very well, so I'm glad I got the dvds.  If you're in the same boat as me, here's what I suggest:  Rip the episodes to your hard drive, extract the audio, pitch it down to normal, then rejoin it to the video.  Then find the episodes that are slightly blurry, and put them into an editing program that allows you to sharpen them a bit.  It ain't perfect, but will likely help, a little.

But again, if you can stream Hulu flawlessly, and have a video capture device, that's your best bet.  The booklet is fun and informative, but not to the tune of $30.00. LOL.

With all due respect to SHOUT, this release needs to be redone.  Until it is, stick with your bootleg or Hulu, if one of those two is a current option.  If not, then get the dvds, and enjoy them for what they are...childhood memories.",1364774400,101,1959,4.524216524216524

4190376,4,B003T9YANM,"Forty years ago, when I first saw ""Voyage Into Space"" and fell in love with Giant Robot, I was unaware that the movie had been assembled from a TV series. If the West Coast broadcast the full series, I was unaware of it. I bought the official VHS set when it became available, and later a bootleg DVD set. When I learned there would finally be an official DVD release, I pre-ordered it immediately. As a Prime member, I had it the day before the street date.

""Enough backstory,"" you say. ""How's the official release?"" Well, it's a mixed bag. On the one hand, I'm happy to have a complete official release with an entertaining, well-researched booklet to go with it. On the other hand, I was expecting a little more ""remastering"" (that is, cleaning-up of the source material). The title sequence is still the scratched, dirt-speckled mess it's always been. If I'd headed the project, I would have recut the title sequence using a better copy of the same footage from the series. The color saturation in the episodes is the best I've seen (that is, among versions of the series), but there's still a lot of noise and speckling in the picture. Personally, I wouldn't mind a slight touch of digital noise reduction. Also, there's a bright line on the left side of the 4:3 image. It's noticeable mostly during the (now defunct) Orion Pictures intro. (Speaking of which, do we NEED the Orion Pictures intro before *every* episode? I say NO.)

All that aside, for me it was well worth the price. And here's a little secret: Even though I've owned a bootleg DVD set for years, I have never actually watched every episode. So my son (who is the same age now as I was when I first discovered Giant Robot) and I will take the full journey together. These are the memories that will last a lifetime. :)",1364256000,15,1791,4.541795665634675

Although the quality of the US opening didn't look too good, the actual episodes look better than I've ever seen them (much better than when I watched them on our black and white TV back in the 70s). It's not state of the art high-definition, but it looks great, maybe even better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-The-Original-Series-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0002I831S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;that was released before it was remastered.

Any fan of kaiju such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Godzilla-Collection/dp/B000VXWK86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Godzilla Collection</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ultraman-The-Complete-Series/dp/B002DQSKLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ultraman: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;should love this series. It is my favorite of all the ones I've seen--partly because of how much I wanted my own Giant Robot as a kid, but also because of how the series develops the relationships of the characters and resolves the battle between Unicorn and the Gargoyle Gang.

This is THE OFFICIAL RELEASE produced from the original prints and is the best quality ever to hit the US--not to mention it's legitimate. Unfortunately there are no special features, but the set does come with a terrific 24-page booklet with some information even long-time fans like me never knew.

Note: for some reason fans of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Giant-Robo-Economy-Pack/dp/B000FFL2ZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Giant Robo - Economy Pack</a>&nbsp;do not seem to enjoy this series. If you fall into this category, you may not appreciate this the way those of us who consider this a cult classic do.

HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION TO ALL LIVE-ACTION, FOAM-RUBBER-SUIT-WEARING KAIJU FANS.",1364256000,5,2184,6.927272727272728
4190378,5,B003T9YANM,I can't wait to buy it an add to my collection Johnny Sokko an his flying robot great tv series an I hope somebody can get Space Giants !! On DVD to,1364083200,2,148,3.65625
4190379,5,B003T9YANM,"If you like Ultra-man, Godzilla and Gamera you will love Johnny Sokko and his Flying Robot. Great live action Japanese retro SciFi. This is the same studio that brought you Gigantor and originally debuted as a manga in 1967, illustrated by Mitsuteru Yokoyama. The Robot shoots bullets from his fingers man!!! This DVD will compleat your Kaiju giant monster collection. This TV show was only previously available by bootleg dvd or an expensive Japanese import. I only wish it had the 25th Anniversary special that was shown on Japanese television as a bonus feature.",1362441600,6,565,5.0212765957446805
4190380,5,B003T9YANM,"Ok, seriously, I have been waiting for three series to be released to home video in an affordable manner for years. Ultraman, Space Giants and Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot. So far, 2 out of three ain't bad! ;-)

As a kid these shows were the greatest because they were mine. By that I mean, they weren't Superman or Captain Marvel or Buck Rogers which were all around for my father. Don't get me wrong, they were all great. George Reeves as Superman was amazing when I was a kid. My father grew up with only the comics and radio versions as TV hadn't been invented when he was born. The TV show was really more for me. He did have movie serials to enjoy of which Captain Marvel, Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon fit that bill. Anyway, they were his which he shared with me. I got to enjoy these Japanese shows dubbed to English and, by proxy of my exposure and interest I suppose, share them with him.

So I'll add this collection to my Ultraman, Speed Racer, HR Pufnstuf and Spiderman 67 and enjoy a little nostalgia of my own. Now, about the series...

If you don't already know, Johnny Sokko was the luckiest kid in the world. He got to control his own giant robot. He would talk into his watch and dictate instructions to it which included flying, shooting missiles from various places in its body, and beating up bad guys - most of which were very large giant-sized bad guys themselves. What's great about most of these kids shows at the time is that they didn't outgrow their initial audience. Today it seems they run a series into the ground. Then, Ultraman had 39 episodes. Pufnstuf had 17 episodes. Johnny Sokko also has a limited amount of episodes which takes you on a complete arc from the day Johnny meets the robot until he defeats the bad guys once and for all. A beginning a middle and an end. Imagine that? Something they actually teach to kids in schools to this day. Whereas today's shows teach kids to cash in on popularity for the most possible cash you can carry. (The scripts don't teach them that but the way they go about many of the programs do teach that.)

Details about the quality of this release to follow once I get it in my hands.",1361404800,12,2164,4.375621890547263

4190384,2,B003T9YANM,"Most important for anyone considering a purchase is that this is not an 'official' release - It looks like someone recorded the show on television, ran it through some editing software to clean it up a bit, and authored a DVD collection.  That being said, as this show is not available in any other way, you need to decide if you care about the drawbacks enough to skip buying the only release of Johnny Sokko and his Flying Robot - To me, it was totally worth the purchase - It's all about the nostalgia of growing up in the 70's and having Johnny Sokko rotated with Ultra Man after school (and yep, we had 'Monster Week' as well - usually featuring Godzilla movies....).  While totally cheesy - there's a 'calm' feeling that fills you up when you have these on....",1357516800,2,766,4.464285714285714

4190386,4,B003T9YANM,"This series brings back some fond memories. Even before those ""Power Ranger-clones"" hit the airwaves, this was the after-school show to watch back in the late 70's-early 80's.
The story was pretty clever too: A scientist creates a super robot to be used by an evil overlord, but before the main villain can use it the robot has to be activated by voice-command only.
Problem was this: whoever spoke into the remote first was automatically ""imprinted"" as the robot's master (who just happens to be a reckless young boy, Johnny Sokko, who spoke to the robot by accident just to see what happens)
The rest was history as the boy ended up helping the japan government fight off the overlord's monster minions by issuing voice-commands to his flying robot to help defeat these monsters godzilla-style!",1357344000,3,796,4.9037037037037035

8405022,5,B003T9YANM,"I remember this show as a child  I thought that the show (at that time was something I never saw before..) I loved the action as Johnny would control the robot with a watch that he wore on his wrist.  I liked the way the robot would flight the monsters that Emperor Guillotine  would send to stop and try to get the robot for his evil purposes....

Today, when I see this show it brings back fond memories of  how a boy could control a robot and how that robot fought for justice and in the end good overcomes evil. I would recommend this show for anyone who grew up with this show.. It is hard to find and it is worth it for your collection.",1516579200,2,642,4.063492063492063
