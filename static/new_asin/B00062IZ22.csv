8037062,5,B00062IZ22,"This is an excellent show for children of all ages. Our grandson of 12 never tires of watching the 30 minute episodes over and over again. The show was well written, well acted, and visually beautiful and who doesn't love ""Fang"", a dog hero much like Lassie. You will be glad to have all the episodes of this show in your video library.",1356220800,2,336,4.349206349206349
