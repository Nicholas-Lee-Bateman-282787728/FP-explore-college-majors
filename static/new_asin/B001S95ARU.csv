8339511,4,B001S95ARU,My daughter loves this series and this one was no exception. :-),1438646400,,64,4.416666666666667
8339512,5,B001S95ARU,We fell in love with this series since the very first one. My four year old started jumping on the princess bandwagon and we wanted her to realize she is a princess in Gods and our eyes. We found this one about having a cold and still feeling special and pop it in whenever she is sick. She loves them all! It is better if your start with the first one Gigi Gods little Princess so that you understand Gigi a little better and build from there.,1365292800,,444,4.114942528735632
8339513,5,B001S95ARU,"I was first introduced to Gigi through a visit to Lifeway Christian Bookstore.
My 6-year old daughter fell in love with her and after watching the DVD, I fell in love with her, too.
Sheila Walsh has captured the perfect idea of a little girl who is still innocent and loves life!
This is great for all little girls!",1266710400,3,315,4.3559322033898304
