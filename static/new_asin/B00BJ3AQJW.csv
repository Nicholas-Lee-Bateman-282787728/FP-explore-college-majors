8569367,5,B00BJ3AQJW,"I love this yoga dvd.  I love yoga and have explored numerous yoga classes in person, online, in videos.  I get better results from this dvd than anything yoga related I have explored. The combo of  the flow with the music is remarkable.  I love Rainbow's method of training, challenging combined with wise counsel to move at own pace. There is so much packed into this dvd.  Highly recommend yoga enthusiasts check this out. It is appropriate for beginners as well as experienced practitioners.",1482796800,,495,4.845238095238095

8569370,2,B00BJ3AQJW,"Very disappointed in this DVD.  The volume is very low so I have to turn my TV up super high, just to hear her instruction.  There is filler narration which was obviously done during editing.  The voice is soft & gets drowned out by the music.  Sometimes she flows without narration, which is frustrating because it makes you have to look at the TV instead of doing the poses.  A few minutes before & after shows her doing these super advanced poses & balancing moves, showcasing her flexibility or whatever, whereas it would have been much better to use those minutes leading the viewer in more yoga poses.  I wish I didn't spend the money on this DVD & instead bought something else by Rodney Yee, Bob Harper, Kristen McGee, Tara Stiles, or Jennie Rawlins.",1435104000,,758,4.5777777777777775
8569371,5,B00BJ3AQJW,I am very pleased with this video.  It is very informative and a good workout.  Mostly I enjoy the pace of the workout which allows you to get the most out of the poses and breath through them instead of trying to achieve some level of aerobic benefit.  Highly recommend if you prefer a more steady pace and getting more out of your stretching.,1417305600,,344,4.34375
8569372,5,B00BJ3AQJW,I love Rainbeau Mars and her yoga DVD workouts. They are perfect for people who want to de-stress and feel better about their bodies. This Yoga for Beauty workout is perfect for loving yourself and your body through yoga.,1389571200,3,221,4.6923076923076925
8569373,5,B00BJ3AQJW,"Thank you Rainbeau Mars for such a beautiful yoga practice. These workouts are as inspirational as they are healthy. In just a week (practicing only 3 or 4 times), my body has gone through a noticeable detoxification - cleansing my intestinal tract and clearing up some skin impurities on my chest. I can't recommend this highly enough and plan to purchase a couple more as Christmas gifts. Even if you are out of shape or haven't been active for a while, you won't be sorry. Rainbeau has designed these routines to help you fall back in love with your body through gentle but powerful moves.",1386288000,6,592,4.647619047619048
