3621735,3,B001GVJYTU,"Come on! This show has been off the air for ages. WHY IS THERE NO COMPLETE SEASONS?

For what it is, that being a ""best of"" collection, it's fine.",1262995200,6,146,4.0344827586206895
3621736,5,B001GVJYTU,"Junkyard Wars were truly special!  If your interest includes seeing how a group of very talented people, with the help of an Expert, can create incredible machines out of junk in 10 hours flat...and accomplish amazing feats with those machines, then these Wars are for you!  There's 14 great episodes, ranging from Artillery Duels to Paddleboat contests, to McGyver type ultralight flyoffs, that keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish!  There's plenty of heated, but good natured competition between the teams, stunning creations, and desperate races to earn the number one spot.  All of this is ably overseen by the host, Tyler Harcott, and his two lovely and engaging female co-hosts. Unfortunately for viewers, they only show up one at a time!  A great contender for that 'must have' DVD collection.",1239062400,4,818,4.985294117647059
3621737,5,B001GVJYTU,"Ever since JunkYard Wars went off the air several years ago, I have been looking for season episodes, and while these are not complete seasons you get some of the best episodes from JunkYard Wars on these DVD's.

The science channel has purchased the rights from the learning channel so now we know where to find episodes.....

My  husband and kids are thrilled to have these quality DVDs to watch any time they want.  The set is a little pricey, but well worth it for any Junkyard Wars Fan.
Mooch",1235433600,,497,4.488888888888889
3621738,3,B001GVJYTU,"Fans of JYW's,  only buy this DVD set if it's your last resort. There are only two episodes per disc A waste of disc space, they are of the last season of the US show, and its not the complete season.
The collection should be of both the US and British shows, With out takes and bloopers.
JUNKYARD WARS was one of the best shows THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL  has aired in recent history.
Come on Amazon you can do better!",1231027200,40,414,4.1625
8307283,5,B001GVJYTU,bought this for my husband but I enjoyed it as well.,1486598400,,52,3.8181818181818183
8307284,5,B001GVJYTU,"The TV show was so much fun to watch. You got to see how a team made up of different backgrounds put together an item from junk in a junk yard. Not having any previous knowledge of what the item is, they are to make, until the teams are told at the time of the show. You'll be amazed how the process of thought, analysis, and team work can accomplish. The hosts are funny as well as the situations the teams are put in.
You must at least get this DVD set, to sit back and be amazed. Some situations will simply amaze you.
Too bad the TV series isn't shown now.",1466121600,,560,4.008928571428571

8307288,1,B001GVJYTU,On this multi disc set not a single disc would play on my Blu-ray player. They would get to the menu screen and no farther. Tried one of the disc's on another player and same thing. They played in a CD-ROM drive. Love this show but given the fact that EVERY disc didn't work I'm afraid to reorder.,1356566400,,297,4.137931034482759
8307289,1,B001GVJYTU,"I ordered it after a good wait you did not send me junkyard wars best of collection ( seven disk set ) you sent me two disk of what I did not ordered I guess you figured I would accept but I did not I had you send my money back I sent you back the wrong order and now I'm very scared to order  junkyard wars best of collection ( seven disk set )  from you cause it seems  if you can't complete the order you would send me what ever you want
P.S. I would like it if you call me to figure this out",1355616000,,495,3.607476635514019
8307290,5,B001GVJYTU,Wonderful entertainment as family drove across USA this summer. what more can i say? Grand son loves to make stuff out of junk and this was very entertaining for him.,1344124800,,166,4.566666666666666
8307291,3,B001GVJYTU,"All seven DVD's in the collection have been recorded in the DVD-R format. Most unusual and very inconvenient because only a
computer or a DVD player designated DVD-R-RW can play these otherwise excellent episodes. The original U.K. episodes are much
better than the ""americanized"" version. It's too bad we can't get the complete British collection, they were a gem. The delivery was much faster than promised. Would have been nice to know these DVD's are in the R format before ordering. The
content is excellent for showing students what problem solving skills are all about. Motivates the students to get away from
the computer and start thinking with their heads and working with their hands.",1301961600,8,695,5.052173913043478
8307292,5,B001GVJYTU,"This compilation is great.  Just wish it had some of the earlier episodes, like the amphibious vehicle one.  It's a good value for as many episodes as you get.",1300579200,,159,4.448275862068965
