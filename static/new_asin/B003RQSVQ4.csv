8403837,5,B003RQSVQ4,"This is another great installment in the line of Primos DVDs. Usually these DVDs focus on elk, deer, or turkeys. This one, however, focuses upon other game species, western species in fact. It is all fair-chase hunts which are covered. (Still, sheep hunting is a bit boring. I know that this is not the DVDs fault, but is an attribute of the DVD.) All in all, a great way to spend an hour waiting for hunting season.",1477526400,,416,4.415584415584416
