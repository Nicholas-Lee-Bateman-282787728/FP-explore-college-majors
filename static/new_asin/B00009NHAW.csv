8500780,3,B00009NHAW,"Considering the picture on the DVD cover, I had wrongly assumed this was another film staring the fabulous George Zucco.  Unfortunately, he is just a bit player at best in this ragged comedy of terrors.  Zucco presence was sorely needed but conspicuously absent for most of this brief foray into a crime story of sorts.  The story begins with a murder where the corpse gets up and walks away.  The body is found several times by several people and promptly hidden in the oddest places as though that was the most logical thing to do.  Two shiftless reporters each want the exclusive on the murder but instead of writing the story and turning it in first, they waste time trying to keep the body to themselves.  It isn't long before the murderer shows up wanting the body back so he can dispose of it permanently.  To say nothing of the dopes who have interfered and ruined his plans..............

Everyone except George Zucco vies to be the comic relief.  One would have sufficed considering the material they had to work with.  Of the bunch, Leo Gorcey is the most annoying.  Even so, I found it moderately entertaining.  I will watch it again someday so it's a keeper.",1431302400,,1171,4.631067961165049

8500782,3,B00009NHAW,"PLOT: A BODY keeps disappearing and 2 reporters get drug into murder.

JOE WELLS a criminal is keeping some HOT diamonds when George Zucco shoots him and gets the diamonds. WELLS is not dead and crawls to the WAX MUSEUM and dies on the stair case of Lady REPORTER...SUE GALLAGHER who lives above the museum.... Sue hides dead guy WELLS til she can ""turn in the big SCOOP"" to her paper. Zucco then trails the blood to the Wax Museum and is looking for DEAD GUY Wells. Leo Corcey (CLUTCH) care taker of the  Wax Museum....stumbles across the hidden corpse and moves it yet again til he can give his buddy REPORTER....Pete Willis (WILLIAM GARGAN) a scoop. This is done for humor here when the body is moved several times and Zucco is busy trying to find it. ADD the bumbling police who are always one step behind the body being moved and this is the plot. DRAGS til the final scenes when rival reports SUE and PETE join force to stop Zucco...the scenes in the WAX MUSEUM are well done and disappearing body is done for humor. this print is rather poor but well worth watching once for the Leo Gorcey bits alone....""lets perambulate"".. LOL....3 STARS~~~",1408924800,,1149,4.545893719806763
8500783,2,B00009NHAW,"Midnight Manhunt, 1945 film

The story begins with a view of a hotel at night. A man enters and knocks on a door. When it is opened he shoots the occupant, then takes a small box of diamonds. The victim rises to stagger to the door. A cop calls about finding the body of Joe Wells at a wax museum owned by Henry Miggs. But the body has just disappeared! Clutch mangles his language for comedy. Reporter Sue Gallagher shows up, and finds the body in a staircase. She moves the body to hide it in plain sight. The police arrive to investigate. Sue calls ""The Chronicle"" for a photographer. Reporter Pete Willis arrives, and the photographer too. Pete finds a key on the stairs. Clutch does his comedy routine.

The killer shows up at Sue's rooms to ask about the body. ""It's a collector's item."" Clutch and Miggs try to move the body. The police return to the wax museum to look for the corpse. They arrest Sue for taking the corpse. Miggs is also arrested for putting the body in a freight car. Sue meets that killer and they drive to the freight yards. Clutch and Willis were there first. The police show up with Miggs. ""I'm awful tired."" A shot causes confusion, Sue escapes. She calls the Editor, who fires her. Sue visits Pete, they and that killer will go to the body. Next the waterfront. Will Sue and Pete be double-crossed? Will they triumph over the killer? Yes. We learn where they hid the body of Joe Wells (for a final surprise!). There will be a happy ending for Sue and Pete.

This mystery-comedy must have been popular with the audiences of the day. It is at best only an average low-budget movie (no outdoor scenes). Other films from that era used a wax museum as a background for the story. The OPA required using less electricity to help the war effort, that explains the dark backgrounds.",1289520000,,1806,4.450151057401813

8500786,1,B00009NHAW,"MIDNIGHT MANHUNT (1945) was a title with which I was unfamiliar, but the cast was impressive, so I selected it to round out my order. What I got for my $5 was an hour, missing from my life, that I can never, ever replace.

Okay, let's keep this short. George Zucco shoots some guy in a cheesy flophouse and takes a box of diamonds from him. The guy - who we find out later is ""famous gangster"" Joe Mills, missing for five years - isn't quite dead, and crawls to a nearby wax museum called the ""Gangster Wax Musuem"". No, I'm not kidding, and No, it's not supposed to be a joke. Anyway, a feisty female reporter (Ann Savage, of DETOUR fame) happens to live in an apartment above the wax museum, and coming home, she finds Mills' now quite dead corpse. She stashes it in the wax museum and runs upstairs to write the story. But William Gargan (a/k/a Martin Kane, Private Eye), a rival reporter and sometimes boyfriend of Miss Savage, snoops around and finds out what she's up to. As does a snoopy police lieutenant. And a snoopy night watchman. And Mr. Miggs, owner of the wax museum (played by the Bank Examiner from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE). And Miggs' assistant, Clutch, played by Leo Gorcey, who thinks he's playing Slip Mahoney, a character that actually hadn't been invented yet (""We can figger dis out t'rough mental reduction""). Oh, and so does George Zucco, looking for the corpse he lost (Mr. Zucco, the film's star, does not have a line until 28 minutes have elapsed of the 61 minute film.) So they all chase each other around and the ""comedy bits"" consist of old Mr. Miggs constantly whining ""I'm tired"" and Clutch moidering da King's English and looking for a light for the cigar butts he picks up. And don't worry, I'm not gonna reveal the ending, mainly because I fell asleep about 50 minutes into this thing and woke up just in time to see Mr. Zucco in handcuffs and the two reporters lip-locked.

For an Alpha print and transfer, this is good indeed, perhaps the best I've seen from this cheap company. There, I've said something nice.

I imagine that this film was shown at the end of a long day to clear the folks out of the movie theatre, and I imagine it worked very well.",1100390400,16,2188,4.437810945273632
8500787,3,B00009NHAW,"This is one of Paramount's low-budget features produced by William Pine and William Thomas. As is customary with Pine-Thomas product, the cast is accomplished, the story is atmospheric, and the workmanship is efficient. The entire cast will be familiar to fans of old movies: William Gargan and Ann Savage as the bantering newspaper reporters trying to outscoop each other when a murder victim disappears, George Zucco as a velvet-voiced, dangerous killer, Leo Gorcey as comedy-relief office boy, Charles Halton as a worried museum curator, Don Beddoe as a frustrated detective, Paul Hurst as a bemused watchman, and George E. Stone as the missing corpse (always a fine actor: he doesn't say a word, but he expires eloquently). The pacing is good and the dialogue is snappy. The DVD derives from an old 16mm print that was very popular at some TV station -- there are frequent cue marks for station breaks, but thankfully no choppiness or serious damage. This has its own peculiar charm for movie addicts, because it looks just the way late-show movies used to look on television, before video and cable. It's an enjoyable hour for movie buffs.",1066867200,17,1144,4.994764397905759
