The truth will come out, one way or another. The world is not only waking up to the Zionist lies and crimes, but it is starting to take action.
Intifada! Intifada!",1453334400,4,303,4.527272727272727
8081058,1,B000AYQO6A,"Dull. Boring. I can't describe just how sleepy this documentary made me feel. Outside of that, it is a political hit-job in the guise of a documentary. If you want to watch an anti-Israel diatribe (more subtle than most, but so subtle as to be dull), go ahead and watch this. If you want to know about the thousands of lives that were saved by keeping suicide bombers out of Israel, go visit Israel..but you won't hear that mentioned in this movie.",1446595200,6,448,4.475609756097561

8081060,5,B000AYQO6A,"Someone should call B'nai B'rith .. I can't believe I watched an entire movie about Israel and not once did anyone mention the Holocaust. Clearly this is a movie by self-hating Jews; the ones who actually think for themselves. Shame on them. (They're probably French. You'd never find people like that in America).

The movie is pretty good though ... if you like thinking for yourself. And, it doesn't have one of those holier-than-thou Narrator Voices telling you which side of the fence you should be on. (Although, I guess, that's pretty obvious really).",1247961600,5,558,4.9361702127659575

The filmmaker probably went to the same school as Hussein Erkenov (""100 Days Before the Command""). Watching this movie is about as exciting as watching mildew form in real time, and just as pointless. I expected much more from the film. Very, very disappointed.",1212192000,4,580,5.041666666666667
8081062,4,B000AYQO6A,I think this was a good documentary that shows what is there--a wall of separation.,1206489600,2,83,4.6
8081063,1,B000AYQO6A,"This is yet another example of a completely biased view of the israeli/arab conflict. The movie claims that the wall is a barrier to peace and a land grab etc, it however does not mention the motivations for the barrier. There have been countless terrorist attacks into Israel over the past 40 years. The nature and extent of these attacks are gruesome and I dount any country faced with this on a daily basis would do anything less than build a wall (and probably do a lot more).
Israel, just like any other sovereign country, has a right to defend itself and the wall is completely justified. There has never been a state of palestine and so the claims that this is a land grab are complete fabrications.",1204156800,8,706,4.5234375
8081064,4,B000AYQO6A,"In 2002 Israel began constructing a 400-mile ""fence"" along the Green Line that separates Israel and the West Bank. This ""wall"" consists of 25' concrete panels, trenches, endless razor wire, guard towers, sensors, alarms, cameras, radars and check points. It is only 50 yards wide, but in fact it symbolizes an immense geo-political gulf. Director Simone Bitton was born in Morocco, educated in Paris, and resides in Jerusalem. Fluent in Hebrew, Arabic, French and English, she uses the crude architecture of this ""wall"" as a rich metaphor of the political debacle in the region. Yes, in some sense the wall ""protects"" Israelis from terrorists, but of course it also imprisons them, exacerbates the strife, and partitions normal citizens on both sides, almost all of whom who were interviewed in this documentary hate the wall. ""Without peace,"" remarked a foreman on the job, ""this fence is worthless."" In Hebrew and Aramaic with English subtitles.",1169596800,10,947,5.196078431372549
8081065,2,B000AYQO6A,"Whatever we want to say about Israel's blood soaked foreign policy, it really doesn't matter all that much next to the fact that innocent Israeli citizens are being killed. Yes, I know that innocent Palestinians are being killed as well, and they matter just as much. But the fact remains that Israel is the country with money to burn, so why not let them spend it on a wall. These two groups desperately need to be separated, and if the armchair solution of a wall is the only one that works then who are we to argue?

That said I am unhappy to report that this film is an utter dud. It is a muted documentary on the building of a wall with the sole purpose of keeping the undesirables out. Simone Bitten, the director, seems pretty well set on filming every inch of the wall. Being driven by, walking by, or just standing near by this wall gets lots of face time. They also interview people and ask them their thoughts on the wall. Unfortunately, the only articulate people in this film are those who are reciting talking points. Of course the Israeli government is for the wall, that's why they are building it, and I really don't need their spin on why it's not that bad for the environment. One interviewee takes his air time to whine about how it prevents him from meeting his neighbors. I know I am in the minority with my strong dislike of humanity, but seriously, who likes their neighbors? In my experience they simply exist to call the cops on you when you have too many drunken friends over. I know that since ""Fahrenheit 9-11"" there has been something of a backlash against Michael Moore type documentaries. No putting yourself on screen, no point of view, no fun. I personally don't believe in any of those rules and this film is a perfect example why. Instead of those things, this film has long, pointless shots of nothing in particular (my favorite was of a tree). The goal may have been to create a meditation on the building of this wall. But what I saw was 30 minutes of material, and 60 minutes of cutting room floor filler. And it really is a shame, because this film could have been so much more. What about a comparison to the US/Mexico dilemma now that the US wants to build a wall to keep their undesirables out? Or more cold hard facts as opposed to the opinions of those involved. I also could have done without Israel's justification for the wall that it will help property values. It just seemed out of touch considering how many people this conflict has killed.

In the end, I feel as though Bitten was against the idea of the wall, but she left me unconvinced. If I became involved in a blood feud with a person my response wouldn't be to move into their garage and throw eggs at their house until they moved out. I would pack up and move across the country, thus creating a barrier between the two of us. It got so bad near the end that I started to envy those building the wall, because they at least weren't watching this clunker. *3/4",1156723200,8,2970,4.408014571948998
8081066,3,B000AYQO6A,"In the documentary film ""Wall"", filmmaker Simone Bitton travels to Jerusalem to chronicle the building of the immense concrete wall that separates the Jewish population from the Palestinians. The wall--which is about 500 kilometers long--is built at the cost of $2,000,000 per kilometer, and it winds in and around Jerusalem.

The film begins with one section of the wall and just the voices of children--many of Bitton's interviews do not include the faces of those filmed. The children speculate about the ethnicity of the filmmaker before she begins to ask them questions about the purpose of the wall. From the voices of these children, Bitton moves onto the construction of the wall itself--it's made from huge interlocking concrete slabs, and the camera focuses on the placement of these slabs until the entire skyline and the beautiful view is entirely blocked.

""Wall"" contains moments of startling purity--a young Israeli settler named Moti speculates exactly how he'd attempt to create peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and he also expresses skepticism that the wall will achieve anything except further alienation. One Israeli drives out into a Palestinian area that was empty of settlements in 1942, but now the farmers in a Palestinian village are separated from the olive trees (and the rotting crop) on the other side of the wall.

Other parts of the film are weak--the film concentrates with an almost morbid fascination on long camera shots--we watch a bus unload, a wall being built, and equipment preparing the land. It's no doubt all relevant, but after a while, such prolonged study of the mechanics behind building the wall becomes tedious. Several scenes show Palestinians trying to get through checkpoints, and while the nuisance, delays and refusals to entry were obvious, the system itself (why some were allowed and not others) remains vague--additional background explanation here would be helpful.

The best scenes in the film occur when Bitton interviews the Israeli Defense Minister. He deserves some points for staying put in the chair when he clearly can't wait for the interview to finish, and his remarks are the most significant in the film. He frankly admits to Bitton that Israel considers all the land is theirs--""First of all, we see both sides as ours."" Plus he insists on calling this concrete monolith a ""fence."" When pinned on the semantics, he argues, that there's ""no need to get ideological about different names."" Just one look at the design system of the wall is enough to convince the rational minded that semantics, in this case, are an intriguing issue. For anyone interested in the subject, it's an interesting--but flawed--film to watch. Many of the static meditative shots should have been replaced with explanations, background information and maps, and ""Wall"" would be a better film as a result. As it is, the film still makes a powerful argument that the wall is just ""explusion in disguise."" In Hebrew and Arabic with English subtitles--displacedhuman",1135296000,26,3025,5.16734693877551
