8392029,5,B0039A9M66,"The picture for this DVD and the summary of the movie on Amazon is misleading as it is from The Delta Force (hijacked plane). This DVD contains Delta Force 2 - The Colombian Connection, with Chuck Norris as Col. Scott McCoy fighting a Colombian drug lord, Ramon Cota.  It also contains Missing in Action (correct description).  Both are great Chuck Norris movies.  The DVD plays without problems or skips.  These are great action movies for those of us who enjoy seeing the good guys win and the bad guys lose.",1445040000,,510,4.633333333333334

8392031,5,B0039A9M66,"Want a couple real good action movies? Here's a pair. Do you want fighting, chases, magnificent explosions, huge casualty lists, gunfire of every kind, death and destruction? These movies have it all. Don't stop to think. You'll miss something. Just relax, sit back, and enjoy the mayhem.

""Missing in Action"" is a Viet Nam saga. It seems that some prisoners of war were  unaccounted for. Americans say they're being held. The Vietnamese say they don't exist. Chuck Norris is an ex-POW and is none to happy about the situation. He goes off to Cambodia, joins up with an old war buddy and the two of them on a rag-tag boat become an ersatz Marine Corps and invade Viet Nam in order to find and release the prisoners. But, what about the Viet Nam army and security forces? No worry. Our two-man marine corps fights it's way in, totally destroys a village prison camp, and fights it's way out. Casualties? Piles of Viet Nam soldiers are left wounded, dead and dying. Destruction is everywhere. Our heroes have a few scratches and some sweat on their brows. It's a good, action-packed adventure story, well worth watching if you like this sort of stuff.

""Delta Force 2"" has Chuck Norris as, well, Chuck Norris. What else might you expect? He's one of the world's toughest men, but he can also kind and understanding. Just  don't cross him. Or kiss your fanny goodbye. Chuck Norris is fun to watch. He's just totally overwhelming, and that's the way I like action heros. With that kind of action hero, of course, you need some real scumbags to counter him. Well, this movie had them. Some of the South American cocaine kingpins, including a drug czar known as ""The Scorpion"" were despicable. It was good versus bad. The white hats against the black hats, and you knew who would win. Of course you did.  Delta Force and Chuck Norris would crush the South American cartel and come out smelling like a rose.

These are fun movies. Don't take them seriously. If it's action you want, well everything was rapid fire and there were no awkward pauses. The movies supposedly took place in tropical locations in Viet Nam and South America, but there's a lot of the Philippines noted in the credits. That's fine. They were in splendid settings. Hat's off to the producers and crews. I don't suppose they'll get many award nominations, unless, perhaps, for special effects.
