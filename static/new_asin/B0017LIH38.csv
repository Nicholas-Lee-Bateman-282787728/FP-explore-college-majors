8266439,2,B0017LIH38,"This video was VERY disappointing!  It relates only to Shih Tzu owners who plan on showing their dog.  The tips were from a ""professional"" that handles a very docile, already well-groomed dog.  There are no basic tips for the typical dog owner--just fancy topknot and show grooming.  Who keeps a dog oiled?  Definitely not for your average dog owner.  I suggest you save your money for a good groomer!",1102896000,10,401,4.739130434782608
8266440,5,B0017LIH38,"We lost our beloved Lhasa last August and brought home our new puppy just before the holidays.  His breeder gave us this video as a gift.  I am so grateful!  Not only is this new little one helping to mend broken hearts but I am now looking forward to his grooming with new knowledge and a new confidence.  We had our first dog in various lengths of coat over the years and never knew this much about grooming her - not only correctly but efficiently.  She hated going to the groomer and, each time, I hated leaving her there.  Jake is going to be groomed by me and in his home.  He is going to be a beautiful gold color.  I am looking forward to keeping his coat and admiring and loving him every day.  I definitely recommend this video.",1073260800,5,738,4.214285714285714
8266441,5,B0017LIH38,"""Show Off Your Dog GROOMING BASICS"" is an outstanding dog grooming video that covers the basics for grooming your dog at home, it does not demonstrate pet clips. If you are interested in haircuts for dogs, you should select ""Grooming Your Dog BASIC HAIRCUTS"" at Amazon.com.

""Show Off Your Dog GROOMING BASICS"" is not just for show dogs.  It is for everyone who wishes to learn proven techniques for grooming and maintaining dogs in full coat.  Most appropriate for longhaired, drop-coated breeds such as Shih Tzu, Maltese, Yorkshire and Silky Terriers, Lhasa Apso, etc., this detailed program offers expert guidance and in-depth instruction.

The dog used for the demonstration is not ""docile"" or ""passive"".  He has been trained for grooming. This is a prerequisite for dogs that require more grooming than just an occasional bath. Maintaining a consistent and correct grooming routine is also required.  This internationally acclaimed video is a classic and the ""best of its kind ever done"".  And, for those willing to put the time and effort into training and grooming their dogs to look as beautiful and polished as any show dog, this video will show you how to obtain that most rewarding objective.",1037664000,3,1203,5.045454545454546
8266442,5,B0017LIH38,"This is a delightful and useful video.  Not only does it show you basic procedures for grooming any breed of long haired dog -brushing, bathing/conditioning, blow drying - it also demonstrates how to groom your dog for a beautiful and polished look.  My own dog is currently clipped but I would love to grow her hair longer.  With the help of this tape, I now know proper coat care and how to keep up a long coat.  Aside from all the special grooming techniques that are covered, I was especially impressed with the section demonstrating how to give a dog its bath.  Anyone who has a dog with hair knows that frequent baths are a must.  In the past, I rather dreaded this ""duty"", never again. With the benefit of this demonstration I finally know how to accomplish this aspect of grooming - not only efficiently but correctly. Another highly commendable section deals with the top knot.  There are instructions in some books and diagrams on web sites about how to do a top knot for dogs that need to have hair tied up and out of their eyes.  None of these sources come close to the absolutely wonderful lessons on top knots contained in this video.  Step-by-step and very clearly depicted on tape, this first-hand demonstration can be referred to as often as needed.  Now that I've seen the secrets, I can't wait to try it!  Ena Lane has an easy, relaxed tone throughout this video and her dog is extremely beautiful - a true role model.  I definitely recommend this terrific video.",1027468800,9,1482,4.571969696969697
8266443,5,B0017LIH38,"This is a wonderful grooming video and I recommend it.
I don't have a purebred dog; she is a Lhasa mix but I still care a lot about how she looks (and feels) and about grooming her correctly MYSELF.
With the help of this video, I can ""show off"" my little dog and I am thrilled about that.  I am proud of her and of myself too!
I follow everything I learned from watching this video and I learned a great deal - many new things.  This is a very well done work and I look forward to enjoying it over and over again.",993600000,15,513,3.923076923076923
8266444,5,B0017LIH38,"I loved this video and thought it was full of valuable and useful information.  Thank you, Ena Lane, for sharing your secrets.",991958400,6,126,4.7272727272727275
8266445,5,B0017LIH38,"This was an extremely great video!  I got this thinking i would learn about grooming my dog, but when i was done i had even learned about training my dog.  I groomed my own dog and even championed it with the help of this video.  I highly recomend this video.",977270400,15,259,4.14
