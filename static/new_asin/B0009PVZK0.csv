2311034,1,B0009PVZK0,"Mr. Dickens wrote the strange story ""Great Expectations"" in 1861, after leaving his wife. Mr. Dickens married his wife Catherine in 1836. They were married 21-years; during which he wrote his great novels: ""Oliver Twist""-1839, ""A Christmas Carol""-1843, and ""David Copperfield""-1850. Mr. Dickens left his wife and mother of ten children, about 1857.

Unlike ""Great Expectations"", Mr. Dickens's great novels follow a high-minded thought; balance with moments of cheer, triumph for the main character, adventure, and interesting characters. A novel is not a classic just because it is: old, assigned by your English teacher, or written by the writer of other novels indeed brilliant. ""Great Expectations"" has portions which show Mr. Dickens's ability; however overall it lacks the charm and elements that make his other stories great, true, enjoyable, classics.

This 1981-version has a better first episode than the 1999-version; but then drags painfully; wearing the viewer out. Too much time on the dreary. The 1999-version leaves you empty in the end. The 1947-version of ""Great Expectations"" is best; with John Mills, father of Haley Mills. The 1947-version pulls out the cheerier portions of the novel and focuses on them, for a story of some interest.

Mr. Dickens's, ""Nicholas Nickelby"", written in 1839, is better.",1175731200,18,1320,5.429268292682927
2311035,2,B0009PVZK0,"I agree with the other reviews about too much emphasis on the bleak, and dragging on interminably.  No movement.  No captivation.  Unfortunately filmed in short segments, so you have to deal with opening and closing credits, etc. frequently.

I did find it hard to follow the dialog with the various dialects of the characters, so I wanted to use subtitle.  Alas!  Subtitles are not enabled on DVDs in this series (BBC white covers).  I switched from viewing the DVD via the component connection to viewing via the coax ""VCR"" connection.  That allowed me to take advantage of the television's closed captioning capabilities.  However, I had to sacrifice picture quality.",1169769600,2,670,5.073394495412844
2311036,2,B0009PVZK0,"What started out to be a suspensful movie dragged in the last several episodes. I found myself begging for it to finish, and even then, the ending was very dull. My daughter and I finished the over 300 minute movie with an ""Oh, well."" We love period movies, but this one is better borrowed or rented than bought for a library. I will admit  the Old Miss Haversham was the most enjoyable character to watch. I would recommend other Dickens Classics such as ""Our Mutual Friend.""",1135987200,5,476,4.534883720930233
2311037,5,B0009PVZK0,"It is very faithful to the book. There are so many scenes portayed almost perfectly. The actors are great, especially Pip, ages 8 and adult, the 12 year old isn't so good. Herbert is excellent, and this is around 5 hours long, so you know it isn't just a skim over. It's just wonderful, touching and classic.",1116720000,27,308,4.421052631578948
2311038,4,B0009PVZK0,"There are so many versions of this beloved story of Dickens.  It is hard not to confuse one from another, so let me begin with the facts.  This BBC TV series were made in 1981, and run as long as about 300 minutes.  It stars Gerry Sandquist as adult Pip, Sarah-Jane Varley as grown-up Estella (now the former is no more, and the latter seems retired).
The original story is a very famous one, which is about a boy Pip whose love for Estella changes his life forever, so I won't repeat it here.  The series here actually cover the story very faithfully, and even the minor characters are not neglected.  There are slight changes here and there, but they are minor ones compared with previous filmed versions.  So, you see not only Herbert Pocket but his poor father and mother (whose only concern is the aristocratic families).  This means you spend so many time to reach the conclusion, and you should see it at two sittings.  And you will watch Mr. Wopstle's terrible Hamlet.
About many actors that join in the production; some are good, some not, others so-so (like many standard BBC products), but most memorable is Miss Havisham played by Joan Hickson (better known as Miss Marple in the same BBC series), and Jaggers by Derek Francis.  In fact, these Jaggers and Wemmick (by Colin Jeavons) are the most convincing in the whole history of the adaptaions of ""Great Expectations.""  And you can see Patsy Kensit as young Estella.  She is good, but the best Estella (as a cruel and enticing girl) still remains Jean Simmons in David Lean version.
This is no classic, and sometimes it betrays its TV origin.  Sometimes you notice the drastic contrast between the tone of the interior shot and that of exterior shot, (which happens often in BBC outings, as is the case with ""Bean"" or ""Monty Python"").  But all in all the result is satisfactory with its good pace.  Slightly above average.",1074988800,41,1886,4.641566265060241
2311039,5,B0009PVZK0,"Over the past year or so, I have seen quite a few movies and mini-series of ""Great Expectations,"" and while many of them had striking features and some strong performances, all of them suffered from the same defect: they were too short. Whether at around 2 hours (the movies) or 3 hours (the mini-series), justice was never done to the process of Pip's becoming a mature human being. In all cases, after the return of Magwitch, there was a too-quick movement to the chase on the Thames and the subsequent resolution. Dickens's great theme in the novel went by the board: the question of whether suffering would humanize one or brutalize one. And in this version -- all six hours of it -- we see Pip suffer. Magwitch returns with about 2 1/2 hours of the series still to run, and the stress of concealment, the development of the relations of Pip with Herbert Pocket, Mr. Jaggers, Wemmick, and even Biddy are shown in considerable detail. And Dickens's great theme comes across: Pip IS humanized, but that doesn't mean an end to suffering. ""Great Expectations"" is a dark, sober book, with an ending that is less than clear-cut -- and this 6 hour version catches all that. When we get character development given time to make its effects, we don't need scenery-chewing -- and entertaining though Gillian Anderson and Helena Bonham-Carter were as Miss Havisham, Joan Hickson gets at an inwardness in the character that catches HER sadness and suffering as well as her manipulativeness. Hickson was around 70 when she played the role, and her scenes with the adult Pip (Gerry Sundquist) are given the pace and space to be powerful and affecting. Sundquist's performance is the glue that holds the whole thing together, though -- the move from callowness to confidence to suffering to some recovery of balance is riveting and often painful to watch. Readers of the novel will remember that the story is told by Pip, retrospectively, and in this version too, we hear Pip, in voice-over in places, move the story along appropriately.

One effect of the leisurely pacing of this version is that we see less of Estella, with the result that more attention is focused, as it should be, on Pip himself. Magwitch is played by Stratford Johns -- better-known in Britain than in the States -- and he fills out the character fully. It's a lovely performance. So too is that of Tim Munro as Herbert Pocket -- the ""conscience"" (along with Colin Jeavons's fine Wemmick) of the London scenes, just as Biddy serves that function in the marsh country. Some liberties are taken with Dickens's plot, and they seem to be in the interest of giving weight to Biddy and Orlick, characters who hardly figure in some other versions. Derek Francis, another familiar figure from British stage and screen, is Jaggers, a character capable of surprising us, and perhaps himself. The climactic scene between himself and Pip is very powerful. All in all, this is the version that does Dickens's novel justice -- and even at six hours, it doesn't drag for a moment.",1461715200,,3028,4.789674952198853
2311040,5,B0009PVZK0,"There are more modern versions of this story. You can get a big budget two hour film that may look great but so much of the book will be cut that it really becomes a different story. This is a made for TV MINI-SERIES in 12 parts. For 1981 television, it is a beautiful production. But more importantly the acting is splendid throughout. The transformations of both Pip and Magwitch are absolutely moving. By the end of the story you couldn't love them more. Stratford Johns just seems born to play the role of the grateful prisoner. I never tire of the theme music.",1460678400,,565,4.4423076923076925
2311041,3,B0009PVZK0,I read the book in school and watched the movie. My only disappointment is that it doesn't just play thru. It has I think 12 episodes. So for each I have to wait for credits. But I do love the story,1457654400,,198,3.8536585365853657

2311045,4,B0009PVZK0,It is a very good movie.  I bought this one because it had close captioning on it but my machine would not pick it up.  I thought it would because I purchased this Sony player for the exact purpose of getting the close captioning.,1426809600,,230,4.204545454545454

2311052,5,B0009PVZK0,"Very pleased with this adaptation, recently viewed.  It has pushed out my former preference, the 1946 John Mills/Simmons/Hobson version, though that one has merits.  The Gillian Anderson version left me cold with its inventive, spooky bent stylizing.  This is it so far.  Was pleased with casting, considering Joan Hickson, yes, older than others featured elsewhere, but appropriate to the book type and faithful in execution.  She is a good actress, and I'm glad she finally came into appreciation with her Miss Marple and subsequent parts such as this.

Personally, I liked the adult Pip, finding him sensitive when needed, yet showing the requisite callousness when he was in those throes.  However, I did not like the length of the handling of his burn injury and interaction with Magwitch at the end, which I felt were over extended.  This Herbert was super, truer than true, authentic and credible as such.  Otherwise, all other castings were competent, though the Jaggers character received more detailed and extended interaction than I recall from the book.  The Wemmick here brought amusement, as I recognized him from the Sherlock Holmes series of the `80s, who was Inspector LeStrade in that. On a light note:  I think I've seen enough of side whiskers for a while. :)

This version brought some elements into clearer focus and comprehension, and the length was appreciated because it was so enjoyable and well done.  I consider this a fine depiction of the classic, one of my Dickens favorites, and would recommend it to any and all.",1388016000,,1545,5.011764705882353

2311055,3,B0009PVZK0,"I read the book recently and was looking for an adaptation.  I liked the child actor when Pip was young, but I never warmed up to the adult actor.  Miss Haversham is portrayed too old.  Not too bad overall.",1383955200,,206,4.230769230769231
2311056,4,B0009PVZK0,I loved the actors. I remember reading this in High School and loving the story. The only thing that was annoying was there were so many breaks in it. I will watch it though again as it was a joy to watch.,1381968000,,205,3.9047619047619047

2311058,3,B0009PVZK0,"The casting in this version of Great Ex. is the best I've ever seen, and I've been teaching this novel and showing films of it for two decades. However, it is not always a student favorite, since it is on a ""set"" vs. an actual feature film production. Even so, no one has EVER done a better Miss Havisham than Joan Hickson, and each of the other characters maintains the vibrant integrity of this engaging novel.",1368057600,,412,4.434210526315789
2311059,3,B0009PVZK0,"Iread Great Expectations in High School and I remembered it was dark and sad. However, Joan Hickson did an outstanding job as Miss Haversham. But it is just a little to dark and sad for me. Your glad Pip wins out in the end.",1365206400,,224,4.113636363636363
2311060,4,B0009PVZK0,"I am one who likes to read a book and then watch a movie about it to see how others imagine the story. I was surprised when my spouse agreed to watch ""Great Expectations"" with me; my spouse had not read the book. We enjoyed the series over three nights. Like others have mentioned, it would be more enjoyable if the series were edited to remove the credits and openings for each section. Miss Havisham, Mr. Jaggers, Mr. Wemmick,Magwitch, and Herbert Pocket are extremely well done. If you read the book, it is hard to really like Pip for he is portrayed by Dickens as being very fickle to Joe Gargary. I was very curious to find out which ending the BBC production chose as Dickens wrote two. My copy of the book ""Great Expectations"" actually includes both endings. I think it evokes the time period that Dickens was portraying very well.",1358726400,,838,4.519736842105263

2311062,5,B0009PVZK0,This is a very good version of the story by Dickens. All essential elements of the story are there. Characterization is well represented by the actors. It is broken down into segments that could be used in the classroom.,1350950400,,220,4.666666666666667
2311063,5,B0009PVZK0,"THIS BBC PRODUCTION IS WELL WORTH THE TIME!  WHILE THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IS DECIDEDLY EIGHTIES, THIS IS ONLY A PROBLEM FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN SPOILED BY THE MODERN TECHNOLOGICAL SEDUCTION.  IN FACT, THE CINEMATOGRAPHY EMPHASIZES THE STARK POVERTY OF PIP'S YOUTH; THE HAUNTING LONLINESS OF THE MARSHES, WHICH IMPRESSED ITSELF SO VIVIDLY ON PIP'S CHILDISH IMAGINATION, IS BEAUTIFULLY IF SIMPLY CAPTURED.  THE SCORE, SIMILARLY, IS SIMPLE IN MANY WAYS, BUT FITTING.  PIP IS A COMPLICATED CHARACTER, AND SUNDQUIST, IF AT TIMES VERY SLIGHTLY WEAK, DOES HIM GOOD JUSTICE.  MISS HAVISHAM IS BRILLIANLTY PORTRAYED BY JOAN HICKSON; HERBERT IS DELIGHTFUL; MAGWICH IS VERY GOOD, AS ARE WEMICK AND JAGGERS.  ESTELLA SEEMS A BIT FLAT, BUT OVERALL CONVINCES AS THE WOUNDED DISTANT FEMME FATAL MISS HAVISHAM HAS MADE HER.  PIP'S LOVE FOR HER, PORTRAYED BY SUNDQUIST, IS VERY CONVINCING.  THE ENDING IS VERY GOOD, ESPECIALLY THE LAST SCENE.  OVERALL--VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1341273600,,962,5.317880794701987
2311064,5,B0009PVZK0,"I was hesitant to watch this because I feared Dickens would be too dreary.  However I put it on and, to my delight I was quickly drawn in to this wonderful tale.  It was not all bleakness!  The story is so dense and rich, like a good, old-fashioned meat and potatos meal---not the depressing ambiguous things that pass for art films these days.  The acting is good, with Gerry Sundquist as the adult Pip, probably the weakest of the cast.  Some of the supporting actors were magnificent.

Some reviewers complained about the length.  To me, it gave us the chance to really live in the novel.  I watched it over two nights and had become so engrossed in the story that I was sorry when it was finished.

All in all, this was a thoroughly enjoyable film!",1276646400,2,752,4.430656934306569
2311065,5,B0009PVZK0,"I have watched many different versions of this book, and this one is the ONLY one that has been able to recreate the story with the detail you want to get from a good adaptation of a classic into cinema. Great!!! (had the vhs needes de DVD)",1267142400,4,240,4.127659574468085
2311066,5,B0009PVZK0,"I've seen many versions of Great Expectations and I think Director Julian Amyes hit the mark on this one. I wasn't too pleased with his version of 'The Old Curiosity Shop,' so I approached Great Expectations with some hesitancy. Like many of Amyes' productions, the strength of his theatre trained actors carry the show. The cast in ""Expectations"" was exceptional-especially Gerry Sundquist as Pip and Stratford Johns as Magwitch. Joan Hickson is also incredible as the jilted bride, Miss Havisham. Some of the negative reviews on this page point to the length of this production. I watched this entire series in two nights and didn't find it excessively long. In fact, it was edited quite well and at the end of each episode there was an appropriate amount of suspense. Despite it's length, the story is easy to follow especially if you're not familiar with this tale. In a nutshell, it concerns Pip, a young boy of low birth who suddenly finds his wish to be a gentleman fulfilled with the aid of a secret benefactor. There are many themes but none as important as social division, revenge, and the consequences of subterfuge. Dickens is a master of finding intricate and clever ways to intertwine his characters and make even the most insignificant person become vastly important to his stories. This series has immense value and it's unfortunate it has been reviewed so negatively simply because it was filmed in segments and it was ""too bleak."" Please. Bleakness was part of Dickens' world, but, as with 'Expectations,"" his characters experience redemption, transformation, and justice for the oppressed.",1230422400,45,1609,5.0299625468164795

2311068,4,B0009PVZK0,"Make yourself a haystack of buttered toast, pour yourself some tea, and try to resist the urge to steal the pork pie and brandy from the pantry. Originally produced by the BBC as a TV mini-series, this is the adaptation to see for those who enjoy Dickens for enjoyment's sake. All the characters are here, and all your favorite scenes from the novel (with the exception of Wemmick's wedding scene, one of the most delightful comic scenes from the book, which is sadly absent).

Okay, so the acting is not superb, the settings often seem stagey, and Julian Amyes is not about to win any awards for originality, but this is a production that is to be enjoyed in spite of its flaws, a movie that is to be treasured for its faithfulness, not for its artistic merit. Its length may seem daunting, but, like Dickens' novel, this was created as a serial and may be enjoyed over the course of a week or more. There are certainly much worse ways to spend 351 minutes of your life. Enjoy the film!

NOTE: For those looking for a more earnest, concise production of 'Great Expectations', the 1999 Julian Jarrold version that ran on Masterpiece Theatre is highly recommended.",1224979200,8,1163,4.613526570048309
