1924793,4,B0000DGKI7,"A neat little Rusiian film that takes place in September of 1944, a few days before Finland dropped out of WWII, about a Finnish soldier (Veikko) dressed as a SS officer who was chained to a rock by Germans and left to die, a Russian soldier (Ivan) who is being taken to be court-martialed by his troops when a overpassing war plane kills everyone but him, and the Lapp woman (Anni) who finds both of them and takes them in.
Anni lives a simple life, living out of a hovel on the water and catching fish to survive. Her husband has been dead for years, so having these two men in her home, even if no one speaks a word of each other's language, is still a bonus for her. And therein lies the crux of the humor here. All three of these characters are total chatterboxes, yet no one understands a word anyone else is saying. It makes for some unexpectedly laugh-out-loud situations, and as the film plays out the characters become very well-defined and we see that language is clearly not the only impenetrable barrier between these three.
The first half hour of this film is just set-up, as we get introductions to the three characters and their dilemmas. Not much funny going on. But once they meet, it all becomes very enjoyable, and even a well-filmed but somewhat morbid scene with Anni calling one of them back from the ""paths of the dead"" doesn't change the pace, so much as it gives Anni a greater depth for us.",1077494400,4,1417,4.432950191570881
1924794,5,B0000DGKI7,"At the end of World War II when the Nazis were leaving occupied Finland, Veikko, young Finnish soldier, is chained to a rock.  Veikko struggles resiliently to get free from his chains as he knows that his life depends on it.  After a long struggle with the rock he is finally free and he stumbles across the home of Anni, a Lapp, who is sheltering a Soviet soldier, Ivan, that has been injured from an attack.  Ivan attempts to kill Veikko as he thinks he is a murderous fascist, however, Ivan fails in his slaying of Veikko.  This is the beginning for a friendship among the three as Anni provides a sanctuary for both men.  However, this sets up several misinterpretations and assumptions as none of them speak the same language.  Cuckoo is a warm and funny drama that keeps the audience smiling and feeling the pain and happiness of each character as they regain some hope after a long and cruel war.  This sets up a delightful and extraordinary cinematic experience that will keep the audience cheerful.",1075248000,,1007,4.623595505617978
1924795,5,B0000DGKI7,This movie is my favorite. Don't miss this DVD.,1073520000,,47,4.333333333333333
1924796,5,B0000DGKI7,"""The Cuckoo"" is a wonderful russian film from 2003.  Its plot of three people all of different cultures and speak different languages who meet and become friends is brilliant.  The layering of the three different languages blend perfectly: russian, finnish, and lapp.  The dramatic theme builds interestingly as the film reveals the characters' backgrounds.  Many conflicts arise as more secrets are revealed, especially when it's discovered that the two men are enemies.  The plot adds some humor in the perfect times.  One of the most interesting humorous scenes are when the russian soldier speaks in his native tongue what the other two think is his name: Gerlost, which actually means ""get lost"".  Few movies accomplish keeping the audience's interest for the whole duration with only three characters throughout most of it.  Besides the plot, the actors perform their roles beautifully.  They add their own drama in the dramatic scenes and their own humor in the humorous scenes.  Without such acting quality, this movie wouldn't be nearly as interesting.  ""The Cuckoo"" is a great movie for those looking for a unique film.  This is sure to please many audiences.",1073433600,4,1169,5.159574468085107
1924797,5,B0000DGKI7,"What an extraordinary movie! I was confused at the beginning, as were the 3 people with whom I was watching this ultimately marvelous film. We couldn't figure out why the guy was being chained to the rock, who was on which side of the war, what languages they were speaking. But with a little patience and perseverance, it all becomes crystal clear and the movie soars to the stratosphere. Ten stars.
The whole movie is set in Lappland, home of the ethnic Sami people. There's a pacifist-Finnish-conscript-sniper-prisoner of the Russians (got all that?) who is chained to the rock and left to die (dressed in an SS uniform) because he just doesn't want to fight any more. Didn't want to fight in the first place. Most of the beginning of the movie is taken up with his persistent and ingenious attempts to free himself from the chains - and I think it was all of those schemes that kept my 18yo son fascinated. By the time the bolt came loose from the stone, my kid was hooked on `the real story,' and, in spite of hating subtitles, he stuck around to the end and loved it.
Okay, stay with me here. Then there's a Russian prisoner of his own countrymen being taken to trial for the anti-Communist views found in his diaries. The jeep with the Russian is bombed; only the prisoner survives, but he's badly concussed.
And there's an utterly charming and luminous young Sami woman living alone (her husband was taken off 4 yrs earlier as a conscript) on a spit of land in a beautiful but pretty barren wilderness who ends up with both men in her hut. None of them speak a common language. The subtitles are hilarious as they babble on incessantly to each other with only occasional glimmers of real communication and understanding. But somehow they forge bonds, the seasons pass, the odd romances blossom and wane - and at the back of the whole story is one of the strongest anti-war messages I've ever seen.
Anni-Christina Juuso, the Sami actress, is nothing short of extraordinary.
The ending is touchingly beautiful, perfectly fitting for this touchingly beautiful film.
See it now.",1073174400,91,2082,4.67574931880109
1924798,5,B0000DGKI7,"Somewhere in the isolated and stark Lapland countryside a few days before Finland pulls out of World War II a Finnish sniper is chained to a rock after being accused of being a pacifist and a reluctant fighter. After he is deserted and left for dead he struggles and perseveres to unhinge the chains and break free. He then befriends a Lapp woman farmer and an AWOL Russian soldier on the farm and hides until he can safely return home. What follows is a marvelous film of friendship between unlikely individuals in difficult circumstances. There are obvious language barriers between the three but they continue speaking with each other in their own tongues. The farm is almost completely self-sufficient so there is much hard work to do before the winter sets in. In addition there are apparent romantic feelings between the farmer and one of the soldiers that leaves the other feeling bad. All three elements add for an interesting DVD experience.
The cinematography of THE CUCKOO is excellent and the story is captivating. This is the second terrific Finnish film I have seen lately (THE MAN WITHOUT A PAST being the other) which makes me believe that Finland can produce entertaining and innovative films. I will definitely keep my eye out for more DVDs from this small yet impressive country.",1072742400,11,1298,4.877828054298643
1924799,5,B0000DGKI7,"This is an extraordinary tale of a Sami woman, a Russian Soldier, and a Finnish Conscript.  The tale begins in Lappland, home to the Sami people, with the Finnish Conscript, garbed in SS costume, as a prisoner of the Russians being chained to a rock and left to die.  Our Russian is himself a prisoner, taken to trial for his anti-Communist beliefs.  On the road to his trial, he and his custodians are attacked by one of their own aircraft.  The Finnish Conscript, a sniper on a suicide mission known as a ""cuckoo,"" he bears witness to the events, but is more concerned with escaping from his bindings.  This is where the Sami woman comes in.  During the morning, while in search of materials, she comes across the carcasses of the Russian's captors, as well as the Russian who is dying after the attack.  She buries the other Russians, and drags the Russian back to her encampment, and begins to nurse him back to health.  Shortly afterwards the Finnish Conscript who had successfully freed himself from his chains, finds his way to the encampment.
The story is about three people who speak three different languages, learning to communicate outside of language.  This is not a war film, but an anti-war film.  It is well written, well acted, and it is a story that will touch your heart.  The actors are authentic, and the Sami actress, Anni-Christina Juuso, is extraordinary.  The movie is beautifully photographed.  It is funny, sad, and touching.  Highly recomended.",1072656000,7,1472,4.7896825396825395
1924800,5,B0000DGKI7,"Even if you don't understand Russian, it makes absolute sense.  Not understanding a specific language is the whole gist of the film.  The 3 main characters don't even understand each other.  I leave it at that.  Funny and uplifting drama.  One of the best films I have seen!!",1072569600,4,275,4.645833333333333
1924801,5,B0000DGKI7,"I saw this movie at a festival last month.  It was produced in Russia, with the subject matter taken from WWII somewhere along the Finland/Russia border in Lapland. Fabulous scenery! I have seen other movies about this time period from the Finnish perspective.  This is not a typiclal war movie with lots of blood and gore.  Its main characters include a Finnish soldier left to an uncertain fate by his Germain allies, a Lapp woman, and a captured Russian soldier.  All three speak with great emotion in their native tongues throughout, although it is apparent that they do not share a common language.  This lends humor at times, but also adds a great deal to the effectiveness of their roles. Thank God for subtitles.  Both of the Finns, the soldier and the Lapp, are well known cross border thesbians.  The Russian actor deserves to be as well.  One of the best movies I have ever seen, but I have the advantage of perspective of the era portrayed.",1068336000,18,952,4.658682634730539

I will certainly view this movie again in the next year, and I know the second time will be even better than the first one.
Strongly recommend this movie , even my son who was interested in the young snipper was quite moved by this movie.",1381536000,,541,4.284313725490196
1924815,5,B0000DGKI7,"Great movie for those of you who like an interesting plot. The film takes place during the war and is filmed in 3 languages so subtitles are a must.  A young Laplander farm girl who has lost her husband finds herself visited by an older German officer who has escaped court marshal by means of a bomb which kills his escorts and a young Russian deserter who pries himself loose from a rock he has been chained to as punishment for his cowardice. You are drawn into it quickly and feel you are living the story on the screen. The actions of the characters are genuine and I found myself thinking, ""that is what I would do and that is how I would feel."" It's a curious jaunt into a different world with humanity, desire and a dose of practicality. Not for the big screen but, definitely a simple pleasure for the thoughtful mind. Cozy up with this film at home. I think you will like it!",1369872000,2,885,4.299401197604791

Because they all speak their own language and not the others, communication comes in the context of their situations.

A small look at war in the autumn of 1944, a look at the Lapp way of life.  This is not a film  about big war events nor a cast of thousands.

1924828,5,B0000DGKI7,"Its 1945, and the Second World War is grinding to its inevitable bitter end.

In the silent arboreal splendor of a Lappland wilderness, three strangers are thrown together by chance. One is a Finnish soldier, a disgraced sharp-shooter, chained to a rock by his countrymen, left to the mercy of the enemy. The second is a Russian soldier, charged with some frivolous ""offense"" by the battalion commisar. The third character is a young Sami woman. Living alone in the forest for quite some time, she has no idea where her husband is, after he left to serve in the Finnish army. Fate and war throws them all together.

The Finn and the Russian are intellectuals. The Finn was a university student before the war, the Russian is a well-known poet. The Sami woman is a true child of the earth, and is merely greatful to finally have some company in her remote corner of the wilderness.

None of them can speak the others' language!
Yet, they ""understand"" each other in ways that they don't fully comprehend. In this surreal setting and circumstance, they attempt to ""speak"" to each other anyway. Knowing full-well that neither of them are really ""listening"", are they REALLY talking to each other, ...or to themselves?

A testament to the universal human need for fellowship of some sort, amidst enormous chaotic events, this film is yet another example of the many unique, high-quality films still coming from Europe.

For those purely interested in the World War II aspect of the story, its an illustration of how vast the war was in its many fronts, major and minor, and its influence on people in even the most obscure regions of the world. In this case, the background is the ""Lappland War"", in which Finland was forced to break its alliance with Germany, as the Soviet Union prevailed in driving German forces westward. In fact, theres a very brief scene, in which the characters observe a small party of German troops evacuating wounded personnel, accompanied by a nurse, ...presumably the aftermath of some distant battle.

Three excellent actors gave this movie real appeal. It's too bad it isn't better known. I could go on and on about various scenes that were so touching. I loved Anni's strength, and her tolerance for her two ""little boys"" fighting in the dirt. Veikko was just a total sweetheart. I noticed, after seeing the film for the second time, that in the beginning as he is being chained to the rock, he is sniffing a bit of reindeer moss. He has a gentle soul, which is apparent right away.
With Ivan (Gerlost), it takes a while longer to see his sensitivity. As a speaker of Finnish, I was able to appreciate the movie from a different perspective. I also loved the feature where the director and actors were interviewed. What a darling of a film!",1235174400,,881,4.5125
1924837,5,B0000DGKI7,"If you are at all like I am and find that many Western films are simply not doing it for you, might I suggest a Russian film subtitled in three different languages?????

It is a good thing (not Martha Stewart-like!) to have Amazon friends with which to watch, learn, observe and share.  I watched this film ""The Cuckoo"" (KUKUSHKA) by famed director Alexander Rogozskin with one friend who said to me ""You really need to see this film.  I can't think of anything like it that I have ever seen!""  WHY NOT!  So we did, and he was right!

I speak only for myself when I say that this film has to be one of the most pleasantly odd (if that would be the best word to use) movies that I have ever seen.  This film tells three very separate stories, in three different languages and cultural understandings, with three unique characters who, because of World War 2 are all thrown together in a place and time and must communicate.  Shot on location in the upper regions of Asia, the story of a Finnish sniper, a disgraced Russian Captain and a native Lapp woman comes vividly, comically and tragically to life as Rogozhkin spins a tale of how humanity rises above war and death, how compassion transcends language, and how basically alike we all are as human beings.  These three ""misfits"" all desire love, sex, touch, beauty, peace and tranquility.  This is what each of them had before the War ""enlisted"" them involuntarily away from what they once knew.  War has made them resourceful in ways they probably could have never learned otherwise, but the War has become tiresome and they long, no yearn for sweet humanity once again.  What is fascinating about this film (yes you must be prepared to read subtitles!) is that each character speaks a different tongue, and you must remember that what you are reading is the character's true thoughts and not what the other character is understanding!  Once you get that point, the rest is cake!  This film was a challenge that I was up to, and I am glad that I accepted it.  When Western films are not filling the void that I so feel, I find myself turning to the East and longing for a way to view life that is not American.  This is an incredible humanitarian film that is beautifully and ingeniously rendered.  In the ""special featurette"", director Rogozhkin and members of his team make it very clear that this film could actually border ""on Boredom"" because of the solitary way in which the tale needed to be shot and told.  I never was bored.  I was transfixed and grateful that once again I had experienced something that I otherwise might have overlooked.",1208476800,6,2602,4.5809935205183585
1924838,5,B0000DGKI7,"Director Aleksandr Rogozhkin  was awarded the Russian Film of the Year Prize in 2002 for ""The Cuckoo"" with this following honorarium: ""For the memory of its mise-en-scene, and the originality and metaphorical and humanistic force of its scenario about the problems of communication among human beings.""  High praise indeed for what directors/ artistes long for!

""The Cuckoo"" is so uniquely original in my experience as a lover of film, it is quite a struggle to express how I feel about the film.  Perhaps that is the point!.. ""The Cuckoo"" is a simple, yet deeply metaphorical story, taking place towards the conclusion of WW2 in Upper Lapland, Finland. where a condemned Finnish sniper, a Court Marshalled Russian soldier, and a young Lapland widow, who speak three different languages are brought together and learn how to communicate beyond words.  Each character has become resourceful in his/her own right as the War has forced them to be.  Each character had been something and someone different before the War, and now, as the War is ending, each must decide who they will become.  Each babbles on at each other in their own tongues, never apologising or trying to understand the other.  Some of this is quite comical, as what each person thinks they are understanding is not what is actually communicated at all!  What IS divulged to the viewer, in a very clever way, is the entire backstory of each character WITHOUT the characters themselves EVER understanding that backstory.  What we see on screen, then, is how love, compassion and humanity are communicate; so as you can see this is a very different kind of a film!..The audience knows what the characters do not, but the characters learn what the audience can only observe.  Very different....very unique....highly complex....yet so very, very simple.

There are scenes in this film that will be indelibly etched on my brain, they are that unusual!

The featurette on the DVD is one of the finest I have ever seen in regards to a director's approach to a film and the actor's sense of how and what their characters should be.  You learn a lot about the nature of filmmaking in Russia, and a refreshing ""Non-Western"" approach to telling a story.  This film is a special find and a real treasure! 103 entrancing minutes!",1208476800,4,2284,4.911458333333333
1924839,5,B0000DGKI7,"Of all WWII films, this one is one of the most unusual and entertaining I came across lately.  We meet Finish soldier who is abandoned to die because he refuses to fight any more; Russian soldier on his way to excution who is deemed not loyal and Lapp woman who has spent last four years alone fighting for her own survival and waiting for her husband to come back from the war.  These three people strike unlikely bond, which is even more amazing considering that they each speak different language.  We learn thru their interaction that they deeply care about each other -- but in their own ways.  They also seem to want to think that whatever it is that they are thinking is what the other person is thinking too.  So it comes this wonderful tale about three people who live real life together close to the very end of the war, but at the same time they all build their own reality too.  I particularly liked the female character who is strong, self-sifficient adn resourceful.  She knows what she wants and goes for it.  She is an enchatress, hunter, cook, wife, lover and mother.  It is almost funny when a Russian soldier calls woman like that, living all alone in the cold mountain ""stupid woman"", considering she managed to survive on her own for all that time.  Absolutely entertaining and touching movie.",1203984000,2,1314,4.576923076923077
1924840,4,B0000DGKI7,"The 2002 Russian production KUKUSHKA (""The Cuckoo"") is an entertaining tale of mutual understanding across language barriers on the Finland-Russian front in World War II. As the film begins Veikko (Ville Haapasalo), a recently drafted Finnish student who doesn't seen the point of fighting, is being chained to a rock. Punished for insubordination, he is forced to wear an SS uniform so he won't surrender, and given a gun to shot passing Russian troops. Only a couple of kilometers away Ivan (Viktor Bychkov), a Russian soldier who has just been arrested for the counter-revolutionary activity of writing poetry, is set free when his jailers perish in a bombing. Both of these condemned men are taken in by Anni (Anni-Kristiina Juuso), a Sami woman resident in the area, who holds on to her small farm four years after her husband disappeared.

Each of these three characters cannot speak the language of the others, and Ivan initially hopes to kill Veikko, whom he believes to be a Nazi soldier. The misunderstandings that arise make for fine comedy, but the final reconciliation amongst the three characters is heartwarming. The cinematography really brings out the beauty of the land above the Arctic Circle, and the writers have represented the traditions of the Sami with care. Director Aleksandr Rogozhkin has expertly handled the actors and the action.

The DVD extras are quite entertaining, especially Juuso's bafflement at the suggestion that the Sami people are sex-obsessed.

I watched this film as a student of Finno-Ugrian linguistics resident in Finland, passionate about the Finnish and Sami languages and with training in Russian as well. Audiences with different backgrounds might not care as much for the film, and you might find it a three-star effort instead of four. Nonetheless, I am sure you'll find KUKUSHKA an entertaining film.",1203206400,2,1855,5.176666666666667

1924842,5,B0000DGKI7,"The first 15 minutes of the movie when nothing was happening except for Veikko trying to free himself, we both throught that it was a boring and colorless movie. The rest of it we were literally falling off the sofa, so funny it was. The sheer premise of putting 3 people with different languages and different agendas in the same setting was beautifully explored here. The scene where Anni tries to bring Veikko back to life is rather eerie, but so gorgeously shot! I recommend this film to anyone who is sick and tired of Hollywood blockbusters made for the cheap audience.  This movie is rich in spirit and will leave you smiling for a long time",1182470400,5,648,4.538461538461538
1924843,5,B0000DGKI7,"THE CUCKOO (Kukushka) is a small miracle of a film.  It is not only a unique story but one that draws us into the individual lives of three strangers from different languages and backgrounds who bond in time of war because of their mutual isolation.  It is at once charming, gently humorous, and deeply touching.

Taking place during WW II during the little known Russo-Finnish War, the setting is Lapland.  We first encounter a Finnish student/soldier Veikko (Ville Haapasalo) being chained by the Russians to a rock in a German SS uniform as punishment for his disillusionment in the war effort, thinking that he will be killed as the enemy.  In another area some Russian soldiers are transporting a Russian poet/soldier Ivan (Viktor Bychkov)  condemned for his anti-Communist stance: the jeep transporting Ivan is bombed, killing the soldiers except for Ivan.  Along comes a little Lapp girl Anni (Anni-Kristiina Juuso), finds the severely injured Ivan, drags him to her hut and nurses him back to health.  Meanwhile Veikko ingeniously frees himself from his rock and wanders into the presence of Anni.  Veikko speaks Finnish, Ivan speaks Russian and Anni (aka 'Cuckoo') speaks Sami and the three cannot understand each other's language or customs.  Ivan sees Veikko as a fascist and wants to destroy him; Veikko never wanted to be in the war anyway so he pacifies Ivan; Anni is more concerned with basic physical needs (her husband has been gone four years, conscripted by the armed forces for a war she doesn't understand and she is hungry for the presence of a man in her bed!).  The story explains the manner in which these three people intertwine their lives and beliefs and overcome the barriers of language to form a trio of true universal family.  The war ends and the three 'bodies' separate, leaving behind indelible evidence of their transforming experiences.

Writer/director Aleksandr Rogozhkin has created a masterpiece, a film brimming with beauty of visuals, of warmly humorous exchanges of dialog understood only by each speaker, of survival and of the mystery of life beyond.  The acting is superb, the cinematography is breathtaking, and the message is deeply moving. In the field of strong anti-war statements, THE CUCKOO is the most sincere.  A brilliant achievement!

1924844,5,B0000DGKI7,"The previews for this film caught my attention, so I rented it as soon as it came out. It was a very interesting and thought provoking film. How would three people with different languages and different cultures interact, especially if two of them are enemies? This film explores that question. The performances were outstanding, and the film was beautifully and artisticly done. Much of it was very funny, as the audience is let in on both what WAS being said and what was THOUGHT to be being said. One example of this is Ivan being called Gerlost as if that is his name because he is always telling Veiko to get lost. Even people who speak the same language have a hard time communicating. While this film is rated PG-13, parents of older teens ought to preview it separately so as to make an informed decision as to whether they want their older teens to see it (I wouldn't). This is because of some issues of religion and morality (to say more would give to many plot spoilers).",1134518400,12,982,4.522471910112359
1924845,5,B0000DGKI7,"A very simple happenstance movie about a frustrated Russian soldier, a reluctant Finn soldier and a pastoral Sami woman. There are just the three characters in the movie and all of them speak different languages (Russian, Finnish and Sami). The Finn soldier (Veikko played by Ville Haapasalo) is a sniper (Cuckoo in military jargon) who is chained to his position in a remote outpost. His die-hard and innovative attempts to get rid of the shackles whilst complaining about the war, are simply hilarious (the actor's silent facial expressions are most impressive). The  Russian soldier/prisoner (Ivan) is stranded in a foreign land and is ever suspicious. The pastoral Sami woman (Anni played by Anni-Kristiina Juuso)steals the show with her top-notch acting. Her bucolic lifestyle and simple outlook towards life is thought provoking. None of the characters in the movie can speak or understand each other's language and their interactions (mostly miscommunications) are simply hilarious.

In one of the scenes, Ivan cooks mushrooms for dinner. Anni thinks mushrooms will give Ivan a bad stomach. She prepares an infusion and (kindly) offers it to Ivan, who gladly drinks appreciating the wonderful taste. The infusion is in fact a potent laxative that takes immediate affect.

All in all a wonderful movie from Russia that reaffirms the beauty of life and the futility of war. It is also a movie about making connections by letting go of fear, suspicion and predisposed biases.

Solid performances by Anni-Kristiina Juuso & Ville Haapasalo.",1124323200,26,1542,5.281632653061225
1924846,5,B0000DGKI7,"I stumbled upon this movie on cable and am glad I did.  Other reviews identify that this movie is about three people, each speaking different languages, who meet and interact.  I believe, though, that this movie really portrays the dynamics of communciations on many levels.  It is striking that these three people never learn each other's language but instead hold conversations based on what each one ASSUMES is being disussed.

I've likened this movie's theme to the problems I've observed (and experienced) in the communications between technical people and executives, women and men, parents and children --you name it.  We make the conversation fit what we understand (and want) the purpose to be rather than really make an effort to understand what the other person is actually saying.  That really IS deep.

Throw in the subtle humor and the beautiful scenery and you'll find this is a movie that makes one laugh and think- and is certainly worth watching!",1122508800,7,964,5.0251572327044025

However, it might as well have been commissioned by the KGB, as it invites Finns to wallow in pacifism and brotherly love to all mankind, especially to Russians, when Russia has not yet returned the stolen province of Karelia.",1097280000,3,382,4.876923076923077
1924849,5,B0000DGKI7,"The main theme of this film is well known and very well worked out.  Two enemies meet in a neutral surrounding.  They want to kill each other, but by one reason or another, they don't.  Sounds familiar?  Well here we have an extra twist - a woman.  None of these three people understand each other; they speak different languages and they have different backgrounds.  There is no understanding but yet there is some.  They feel each other.

The film is smartly complemented by the excellent director's work, superb acting, top cinematography, and the beautiful scenery of (Laplandia - Korelia) the northern Russia - southern Finland.  This was the territory the Soviets aggressively took away from the Finns in 1939 in the Soviet - Finish war (the forgotten war).  That is when the Finish snipers and the brutal winter destroyed the Soviet Army but still a little country as Finland could not defend itself against the Soviet might.

I give this film five stars and a very warm recommendation to everyone to watch it.",1093132800,65,1017,4.820809248554913
1924850,5,B0000DGKI7,"HISTORY LESSON: To explain some things that a lot of people reviewing this film don't understand, Finland was NEVER allies with Nazi Germany. They were invaded by Russia at the beginning of the war, and appealed to Sweden, France and Britain as well as Germany for aid. France and Britain were the only ones to aid them, and very little at that. At the beginning of the war, German officers led the Russians into battle against the Finns. Later, the Finns fought to expel the Germans from Lapland. The Germans even scorched vast areas of Lapland in retaliation. My fiance's grandfather fought the Russians during the Winter War and spent time in a Russian POW camp, but was also wounded by a German grenade.

(For more information Google ""The Winter War"" and ""The Lapland War."")

As the Finnish population is so small, it was imperative that every able-bodied man fight in the war. Veiko was dressed as an SS officer as punishment for being a deserter. This was common practice. The Russians would shoot him on sight, since by the end of the war they were fighting the fascists. He had no choice but to fight to defend himself after being chained to the rock to die.

It is very interesting hearing Sami, since the Lapps guard their language and refuse to teach it to outsiders, and very few Lapps ever leave their villages (they might be likened to the Amish in the United States.) Much of their culture remains as it did in the film to this day.

I couldn't help but laugh out loud when Veiko went to build the sauna. Finns joke that they can't live without a sauna (sauna is, after all, a Finnish word.) Even during the war, groups of Finnish soldiers would build makeshift saunas.

This movie is absolutely brilliant. The cinematography and story are beautiful. At times you will laugh out loud but quickly want to cry. The ending, though bittersweet, fit the film well.

I recommend it to anyone who loves foreign, art, OR war films. My fiance and I enjoyed hearing Finnish for the first time in ages, since his entire family moved back to Helsinki. The scenery even made him homesick.

1924851,5,B0000DGKI7,"I would put this movie in the top ten war-movies ever made. The storyline is powerful, actor's play - magnificent and camera work - flawless. The only drawback is that viewer really ought to know at least one language - Russian, Finnish or Lapp to truly enjoy the intricacies of ""he-said-I-perceive"" word play that flows through the movie. For English speaking viewer it really helps to start not with the movie itself but go to ""Special Features"" and see ""Making of Featurette"" to fill the gaps in particular points of Russo-Finnish war in 1944 and better understand the movie. Like, a question that clearly baffles some of the reviewers-  why  was that Finn soldier (Veikko) chained to the rock by the fellow Finns and changed to the SS uniform? Well, for one, SS soldiers, being staunch followers of Nazi ideology and major participant in all these countless war crimes they committed against citizens of USSR, were rarely taken prisoners on Eastern front. Thus, for Veikko accused of being pacifist, the only way to prolong his own life, was to kill any Russian soldiers on sight. The morbid irony of this situation was not lost for him or his executors and was obviously intended as an additional punishment.
Its quite useless to tell the story line - everybody will have own perception of the story and emotional impact of this movie also, will be different for every person. One thing is certain- this movie is definitely worth seeing.",1082073600,11,1442,4.834008097165992
