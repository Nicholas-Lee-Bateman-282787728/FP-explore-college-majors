You will never get it back!,1405728000,,351,3.943661971830986
8094970,5,B000C0GWZ0,"Germany around 1910. After the death of her mother the young girl Manuela von Meinhardis (Romy Schneider) has to enter a boarding school for aristocratic women, whose headmistress believes in strict Prussian education. Manuela as well as some of the other young students adores the rather young and (for this time) unconventional governess Frulein von Bernburg (Lilli Palmer), who tries to see the students as individuals. This believe goes straight against the education represented in this boarding school and sure there are big arguments between her and the headmistress.

Manuela finally admits her love to Frulein von Bernburg after a theatre performance and under the influence of way too much alcohol. This leads to a big scandal which forces Manuela into isolation and the feeling of being abandoned from her teacher, finally resulting into a suicide attempt. Her classmates are able to save her just in time and the headmistress begins to understand that her lack of comprehension and her cruelty nearly resulted in the death of one of her students. Frulein von Bernburg is asked to stay in the school, but she denies in favour of Manuela, feeling that Manuela needs to find her own way in life and that she would be a handicap for this.

The book on which the movie is based ends entirely different: Manuela succeeds in her suicide attempt. Author Christa Winsloe (who had to leave Germany in 1933) wanted to show the destruction of Manuela.

However, the film adaptation with Romy Schneider is brilliant and was a scandal in 1958, showing only one kiss between teacher and student, but one too much. And what a kiss... remember we are talking about Germany around 1910.

Therese Giehse (playing the headmistress) is outstanding and was a famous German character actor of her time. Romy Schneider and Lilli Palmer were some of the few international stars of Germany theatre and the other cast is just as good. But is sure is an older movie and some scenes are a bit corny today.

Being a German I always have to smile listening to the educational believes and statements in this movie. But I know that this kind of Prussian education was a real thing way back in Germany and that makes it really interesting and depressing at the same time.

This is actually one of my favourite movies and I was more than happy to buy it on DVD.",1167350400,13,2339,4.8059701492537314
