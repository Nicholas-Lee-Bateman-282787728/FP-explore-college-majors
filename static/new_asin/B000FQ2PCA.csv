8125445,5,B000FQ2PCA,"This movie is awesome. I thought it was very well done. I never saw the ending coming. Very surprised. Very thrilling and suspenseful. I wish this would make it to DVD or Blu-ray like boarding house, killer workout, and the others. This is one of the best",1452124800,,255,4.446808510638298
8125446,1,B000FQ2PCA,The movie is very slow the graphics are poor and cheap and not really much about a monster dog wouldnt recommend to anyone.,1379808000,,123,4.391304347826087
8125447,3,B000FQ2PCA,"I saw this movie on VHS a long time ago.  The artwork had a picture of Cerberus(3 headed dog) on the cover.  I thought this could be fun.  Oh boy....the outer decsription had it right this is the worst "":Werewolf"" movie ever.  I thought it was just plainly one of the worst movies ever.  The quailty of the transfer is poor.  I could see the film jumping a few times.

If you are a fan of horrible B movies this one is a doozy to watch.

To find out more on it go to Badmovies.org where you can learn about this and other cheesy movies.  Some of which were on MST3K.",1363132800,,566,4.027027027027027
