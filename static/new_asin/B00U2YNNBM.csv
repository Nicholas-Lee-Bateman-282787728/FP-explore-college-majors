7028563,1,B00U2YNNBM,My first single star and well-deserved. Yet another documentary turned Found Footage. Girls go nuts in the woods. There. Now you can skip the first 1:04 of this 1:09 movie. . Absolutely nothing good to say about this. It's only a little over an hour but seems like 4 hours. B-o-r-i-n-g and s-l-o-w.,1468886400,3,298,4.6415094339622645

7028565,3,B00U2YNNBM,"I liked the premise nevertheless, I had things to do and the film failed to advance in character development enough for me to put things aside and continue watching.  I WILL, in time finish it because the film did capture my interest in learning the outcome.

7028571,4,B00U2YNNBM,"For all us high school nerds that remember when the Blair Witch Project opened in theaters as the hottest new movie of the year, will appreciate ""Awake In The Woods"" for it's nostalgic value.  The film harkens back to the chilling glory days of 80s Camp Chrystal Lake's eerie woods that keep your eyes bulging, yet glued to the screen as three brave camping buddies searching for a missing little girl that supposedly haunts the spooky woods of upstate Marion, NY.  Collins does his usual believable character performance, while still maintaining strong ties as a professional actor to a somewhat above average horror plot.  Elements of satanic possession will hold your attention, with a hint of Rambo machine gun comedy here and there to keep you saying, ""not bad, not bad.""  Overall worth seeing if you long for the days when you actually didn't have someone filming you with a cell-phone in the desolate woods.",1438214400,3,914,4.877419354838709

7028575,1,B00U2YNNBM,"Ridiculously bad microbudget c-horror. Definitely don't waste your time or money on this thing - despite the 'local legend' concept, and the kinda cool DVD artwork, this is just another 'I got suckered' weekend shoot, with terrible writing, acting, lighting, camera work, and directing.",1433462400,2,286,5.5227272727272725

7028578,1,B00U2YNNBM,"And I thought Sawtooth was the worst found footage horror film i had seen until i saw this one omg. At least I could laugh at the stupid stuff in Sawtooth...this movie was just plain stupid bad lol. I love found footage films too even some of the poorly made ones,but this one takes the cake for me as far as being the worst one yet. Dont waste your time lol.",1431043200,4,359,4.070422535211268
7028579,1,B00U2YNNBM,"Let me warn potential viewers for I just watched in on Amazon ($1.99 for the rental and I STILL feel ripped off).

This movie was the bottom of the barrel. I have no objections to low-budget movies, in fact I have a weakness for them, particularly horror and ghost based movies. But this movie had NOTHING going for it (and in no ways reflects its' $250,000 budget on screen).

The acting was atrocious (except for the blond leading lady, who wasn't too bad), the plot (which I use loosely) was nonsense, and all other elements that add to the film were either piss-poor or missing.

The music was the annoying 3-note piano progression: blum, blum, (pause) BLUM!!! They used this repeatedly in scene transitions, with a black screen for the first two notes, and then the caption on the third. Again, and again, and again...

Although one transition was unintentionally funny - it said ""Second Night"", but instead of continuing to something happening at night, the scene resumed in the day time. I don't know if they cut the night scene without correcting the title, or it was just ineptitude (given what I watched, I'm leaning toward the latter).

The last part of the movie was complete nonsense - knowing that a young girl is missing and was spotted in the forest, what does one of the characters do when he hears screaming at night? He unloads his laser-sighted, semi-automatic rifle into the surrounding woods!

Ugh - I can't write anymore. If you choose to watch this, at least my conscience is clean - you've been warned!",1430870400,11,1527,4.700374531835206
7028580,1,B00U2YNNBM,Avid Horror Movie Watcher............I Have seen just about every movie on Amazon in the Horror section and this was only ONE of the most HORRIBLE MOVIES here. So bad it prompted me to comment. I will from here on try and warn others so they will not waste their time either. The only other issue is the Movie Selection. Needs a better rotation I have had to visit other sites so I would not have to watch the same sets over again.,1429833600,6,431,4.2682926829268295

8704328,2,B00U2YNNBM,"Some of the acting was okay. Like the married couple and the nurse. They were believable. And the two guy campers were good. The girl camper was okay for a while but then uh, oh, not so good there near the end. The best thing about this movie was reading the reviews. Now THAT's entertainment! The beginning was horrible. I had to continue watching to see what all the hullabaloo was about. Yes, it literally fell apart at the end. Like a writer who wants to get the book over with and rushes helter skelter writing any old crazy, cliche, outrageous scene. And what's up with the girls in their underwear? Was this filmed by a tweenager? Could have been a good movie in the right hands. I think youtube has somehow set a very low bar for movies, even B movies. Are we getting less discriminating after watching all the amateur stuff out there? Oh well, got a lot of laughs out of the reviews.",1495670400,,892,4.379518072289157
8704329,1,B00U2YNNBM,Why use cameras if you are never going to look at the footage?  Really??? And why is the girl in her underwear & the guys fully dressed when they awaken?  What a crap shoot.,1492560000,,173,4.0588235294117645
8704330,1,B00U2YNNBM,"The plot of this is simple enough.  Strange things are going on in the woods and some crazy girl comes out of the woods claiming that something evil is out there.  Of course, the trouble is that the plot was executed so poorly by weak direction and horrible acting that the viewer can't get into the story.  Now, I love horror movies, but the acting is so bad in this that it's like listening to someone scrape their fingernails on a chalkboard for an hour and a half straight.",1492041600,,477,4.337078651685394
8704331,2,B00U2YNNBM,"As I watched the first hour of this movie, I wondered why it was getting such bad reviews-the acting wasn't bad for amatuers, and the plot kept me interested, then the last few minutes started, and the whole thing fizzled into nothing but a stupid contrivance.  The characters all acting inconsistently with how they had been for 100 minutes, and the ""mystery"" was not revealed.  It seemed like the writer or producer, whomever he or she was, just ran out of gas.  It reminded me of taking a written exam, when I realized I only had 5 minutes left to finish my answer, but needed another 20, so I just scribbled furiously to fit in whatever I could before time was up.  The movie borrowed from other cliche endings, and threw  all of them into the kitchen sink. Such a waste.  So now I am joining many others in  advising against watching.",1492041600,,839,4.480263157894737
