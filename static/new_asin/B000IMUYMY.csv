2659201,5,B000IMUYMY,I like the picture because it was entertaining. Elvira has been a favorite of mime for years. Just a campy movie with no hidden message to save the world.,1230076800,2,154,4.344827586206897
2659202,4,B000IMUYMY,"This dvd shows not only what you'd expect to see at the Playboy Mansion on Halloween but also how much hard work goes into the planning, putting together and pulling-off of the biggest, best Halloween party in the country.  It really is a behind-the-scenes look at one of our most famous icons, his home and his ""playground"".",1168300800,4,325,4.701754385964913
2659203,5,B000IMUYMY,"Let's see... Elvira hosting Hugh Hefner's annual Halloween Bash.  Not exactly what I expect from Elvira, Hugh Hefner or Playboy.  The fact is... the DVD is really BETTER than the sum of it's parts.  First of all, it's NOT a sex video (although there IS some nudity, of course).  It's a genuine documentary that covers - and UNcovers - everything you'd ever want to know about the biggest Playboy party of the year.  It seems Hef (as his good friends know to call him) has loved Halloween ever since childhood.  It was then that the future publisher from Chicago received a letter from his hero, Boris Karloff, and started a childhood ""gang"" called the ""Shudder Club.""  Hef even did his own monster comics and horror flicks -- some of which are shown here.  Years later, Hef decided to combine his love for Halloween (and beautiful women) and throw the biggest, spookiest Halloween bash EVER.  For this he recruited his good friend - and fellow monster flick-enthusiast - Rich Correll (a former ""Leave it to Beaver"" kid actor who grew up to become a big TV director).  With the help of a horror effects company called ""Scare Factory"", Correll and an army of artists, artisans and underemployed actors build and staff everything from monster mazes and Scarecrow bogs.  The visual quality is very impressive, as the footage was actually shot in HD for an earlier broadcast on the ill-fated ""Monsters HD"" satellite network.  Elvira's host-wraps are GORGEOUS, too.  (So is she, by the way!)  Overall the production, editing and sound are first rate.  Fans of the hit reality show will enjoy seeing ""The Girls Next Door"" (Holly, Bridget and Kendra) in all their ""themed"" splendor.  My only complaint is the overall length (one full hour) and the lack of ""bonus extras"".  (The complete version of Hef's boyhood monster flick would have been fun, etc.)  Oh, well...  Let's face it.  Most of us will never get in to parties like this.  At least we can DREAM.",1160784000,16,1949,4.775449101796407
8146515,5,B000IMUYMY,"This video turned out to be better than I expected, with Elvira leading us through the presentation with her usual style, the video takes you behind the scenes, showing what goes in to putting on Hef's Halloween party, the design, the equipment, the setup, and the people. Plus a look into Hef's life long interest in all things scary.  Some body painting for the girls and finally the party and guests and their reactions to all the amazing things that had been setup to scare them.",1478044800,,483,4.616279069767442

8146520,5,B000IMUYMY,"I've been looking for this for years, and tried Amazon as a fluke, and found it.  Love the part about how Hef's haunted mansion is put together, and would liked to have seen more Elvira, but still a great buy!",1384300800,2,209,4.225
8146521,5,B000IMUYMY,Enough said gorgeous woman and very funny this is a funny movie .. I seem a couple of her all night ers all of her movies absoultley funny .,1365120000,,140,3.8620689655172415
8146522,2,B000IMUYMY,"Not Enough Elvira. She should at least made appearance to the Playboy Manison. With her show. She had seen the movies, that she's making comments on. So shouldn't she have gone to the manison to see the Haunted House?",1358294400,,217,4.589743589743589
8146523,1,B000IMUYMY,best to watch this one without any sound.  I was expecting more of Elvira (why is she on the cover if she's not in it that much?). Basically it's a lot of how they set up his party and a bit (just a bit-not nearly enough) of the scantily clad women. This was disappointing.,1341273600,,273,4.055555555555555
8146524,5,B000IMUYMY,"Funny as ever reminds me of the great days of late night tv. Who could ever beat Elvira, just loved it.",1314921600,,103,3.9523809523809526
