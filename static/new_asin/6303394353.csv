634366,1,6303394353,"A list of 7 things you need to have before watching this film:
1. Knitting Needles - to jab yourself in the eyes and scrotum at appropriate times (namely the opening titles and anytime during the space filling the gap of time until the end credits)
2. The names and numbers of the closest paramedics, veterinarian and morgue
3. A list of 5 reasons to live (for quick spot-checking)
4. Rectal thermometer (you'll know when it happens)
5. A serum consisting of equal parts mole remover, saltpeter and some sort of fish paralyzer
6. A bag full of bunny farts (to aid w/hyperventilation)
7. And finally, complicity with the theory that Sylvester Stallone is an alien life form sent here to reap carnage on mankind, capable of single-handedly destroying art and culture with little more than a typewriter and the ability to form catastrophic phrases out of seemingly benign language  (i.e. GURU OF DOODOO)...run...for the love of all that is holy...run.",1014508800,10,948,4.888198757763975
634367,3,6303394353,The plot is a little unbelievable but the music is not half bad.  Worth it just see Sly's basement performance of 'old macDonald. It's priceless.,992563200,,145,4.8

I LOVED it, plus, some of the most heartfelt songs  Dolly has ever written were in this film, (Well, maybe not the ones Sly  sang) but who can help but get misty-eyed  with songs such as ""One  emotion after another"" or ""What a heartache you turned out to  be"" Truely a classic Dolly movie, no matter what the critics say!

But it has held-up incredibly well, and I think fans of Dolly Parton (and country music in general) would love it even more now than in the 80's. It's also fun to see Sly Stallone in an offbeat role.",1498003200,,330,4.253968253968254

It had a good story line, but it wasn't as entertaining as it could have been.  I don't think he helped it any, though his fans will not agree, I'm sure.  Still, it's a mildly amusing story about Dolly making a bet that she can turn Stallone into a star.  She had her work cut out for her, for sure.  If you like Dolly movies, you'll enjoy watching it, but it's not really the kind you watch over and over, imho.",1478476800,,522,4.068627450980392

634730,2,6303394353,"Too much against the laws of plausibility. For one thing, no redneck chick is going to accept a bet with a manager to turn any joe shmoe she finds on the city streets into a country singer. Even setting aside the fact that she would know full well that such a thing is unlikely to happen, would such a person really want to get so personally involved with someone she doesn't know and randomly meets in a big city like NY? Not likely! Rednecks generally stay away from big cities as it is. They mostly like to keep to themselves and don't take kindly to outsiders. So why would she want to bring some Italian guy she doesn't know over to her hometown in Tennessee to turn him into a country singer when she knows full well that that is just not realistic and she will surely lose the bet without doubt?

Not only that, but she even lets him walk into her bedroom late at night! Her father is in the same house and doesn't seem concerned that his daughter is allowing this to happen. But I guess if the cab driver ends up being Sylvester Stallone, I guess we can easily overlook these little infractions, because we know this isn't reality and that it is a movie lots of people will watch and it's merely done for laughs. Stallone himself just didn't blend well with the country rednecks and the character he played lacked any humility; anyone in their right mind would not attempt to turn an Italian cab driver into a country singer.

But I guess things could have been worse. The cab driver could have ended up being from Bangladesh! Then Miss Parton would have really have had reason to panic.",1470960000,,1595,4.403389830508474

I know both artists have received quite a bit of flack over the years and the movie was horribly received, but I love it ! ! ! ! ! It's unfortunate we let 'critics' dictate so much of our lives. Both actors did a wonderful job and it was so awesome to see them again, in their youth, in such a fun little movie. It's a GREAT ! ! ! ! movie to watch with kids. No swearing, no bedroom scenes, and the sexual overtones aren't 'in your face' and are soooooo tame compared to what is out there today. I am so very grateful it was available. As horrible as the critics were at its release, I never dreamed I would be able to have a copy. And on dvd no less. Sylvester Stalone's 'Drunkenstein' is out of this world precious. He totally captures how people outside country music feel about the art. I mean, he nails it. I love having this movie in my collection. WOO ! ! ! !",1469145600,,970,4.110526315789474

So says Dolly Parton's character to Ron Leibman's. In other words, she can't stand him! And he's her boss. Holding a three-year contract! This sets the scene for a wager wherein she bets she can turn the next man she sees into a country singer. And guess who shows up! Yeah.

It's fun, extremely silly, and allows both Stallone and Parton to make fun of their public personae. If only it had captions.....",1461456000,2,489,4.609195402298851

634920,5,6303394353,This movie is hilarious. It is a must see for Stallone fans. It's great to see Stallone play in a comedy. He is very funny and Dolly Parton is great as usual. Stallone cannot sing and that is made clear in the film. I commend Stallone for trying something different. The film wasn't a box office hit but  it was a good movie. I like the fact that Stallone doesn't throw one punch in the film. Dolly Parton does land at least one right cross. Her character is talented and very intelligent. She is a great singer and a talented actress who brings charm and grace to all of her roles. Stallone and Parton have great chemistry. This is a fun film.

She takes him to the country to try to teach him county ways in this fish-out-of-water tale. However, just watching Dolly as Sly's character says, ""You look like a moving violation,"" is entertaining. There appears to be no chemistry between them. See it to say you have seen it.

It appears it was pondered, ""Is there anything Sly can not do?"" when this was made. I wonder what his and her thoughts of this are today: regret? shame? Do they just play it off as a movie and nothing more?",1438214400,,687,4.276923076923077

She takes him to her home town with hilarious results. It's a very 80s atmosphere of course. Dolly fans would really like this, she's a good actress.

635124,3,6303394353,"I'll admit that I'm giving this film 3 stars as opposed to 0 solely because of Dolly Parton's contributions.  The film itself jumps around and doesn't make much sense at times.

Sylvester Stallone rewrote a lot of this script, and it shows.  There are bits of dialogue in the film that are very out of place and Sly's performance is really only funny because of how bad it is.  He's just not a comedian, and I'm wondering how he was cast in this role.

Now, on to Dolly Parton.  I'm a big Dolly fan and I think her musical contributions to this film as well as her acting are the shining moments in an otherwise pretty terrible movie.  There are a couple of great moments with Dolly and an acoustic guitar that make you forget that you just watched Sylvester Stallone sing (or really, shout) a song called ""Drinkenstein.""

Overall, I believe this is a must-see for any die hard Dolly fan, but otherwise I would recommend that you pass on this title.",1417392000,,949,4.445086705202312

Stallone is a very interesting character who leaves New York City to go and become a ""one hit wonder"" country western singer, being taught ""down home"" ways by Dolly Parton; she had accepted this challenge as part of a bet.

635394,3,6303394353,"First off, I'm just gonna get this out of the way - I bought this knowing it was going to be a terrible movie. I also bought it knowing was likely to be a lot of fun, as terrible movies often are. Can never go wrong with Dolly Parton, and Sly wasn't terrible. He wasn't good either, but he wasn't terrible. It's Dolly's personality and songs that save the film.

Anchor Bay originally released the film on a barebones DVD, licensed from its studio 20th Century Fox, quite a few years back with a trailer being the sole bonus feature. That DVD has long since gone out of print and fetched very high prices for quite a while. Fortunately, in 2013, Anchor Bay reissued the DVD with a list price of $10, with Amazon and other stores often selling it for much less. (I bought it on here at $5.) This disc is even more barebones than the original. In fact, this disc is so barebones, it contains an FBI warning, the Anchor Bay bumper, and the movie. That's right. Not only is there no trailer, there isn't even a menu. Once the movie is done, it simply starts all over again. There are 12 chapter stops, no subtitles, Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. The 2.35:1 transfer, anamorphically enhanced, isn't totally pristine, but better than one would expect for a flop film not even released to DVD by the studio responsible for making it, with generally good color palettes, a layer of film grain that only occasionally gets unnaturally thick. The transfer is occasionally soft, but most of the soft parts were probably intentional on the part of the director and/or cinematographer.

While it's disappointing that the DVD couldn't simply be a reprint of the original DVD and include the theatrical trailer and a menu, it's still nice to have it back in print, as I'd never seen the film, but wanted to. At $5, it's hard to whine and moan about barebones treatment when we're at least treated to a good-looking and good-sounding presentation of this awesomely bad fun film.",1391040000,9,1956,4.585714285714285

635444,4,6303394353,"This is not a popular Stallone flick. He's even stated that if he could not make a movie, 'Rhinestone' would be the one.
Still, I really like this movie. It is a guilty pleasure for sure. I bought it without really paying attention to what it was about because I'm one of those people who collects things and currently I'm collecting Sly Stallone's filmography. Anyway.

The premise is pretty outlandish, Dolly Parton has to turn some random person, of course it's Sly, into a country music singer to win a bet with her hella greasy manager. This movie is super goofy. It's supposed to be a comedy and it certainly is ridiculous. I found myself genuinely laughing out loud at it, mostly because it is so weird. Dolly is endearing like always. Her character throws shade at everyone and won't be bossed around. Sly's character has some sharp lines, but he's mostly a likable tornado of energy. Dolly has pipes and the songs she wrote for this movie are actually pretty good and catchy. Sly can't sing at all. Well, he'd probably be okay on karaoke night with friends but he's not going to win American Idol.

Don't buy this if you're expecting a typical Stallone flick. DON'T. It did horribly when it came out and I expect it was exactly for that reason.

I think the fact that the dogs howl when Stallone sings is part of the charm of the whole movie. If Stallone could sing there wouldn't have been a challenging bet.

Put her beside Sly Stallone and what on earth did they expect. He is the worst actor in the world and seemed like he was trying to be worse than ever in this. The script is horrible so neither of them really has a chance to be anything but terrible. Why on earth didn't somebody see right from the start that this was a disaster they were making.",1376179200,2,466,4.306818181818182
635532,4,6303394353,"By 1984 Dolly Parton was regarded by many in Hollywood as a hot commodity as she had two hit films under her belt...""9 to 5"" and ""The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas"". These were her first two movies and seeing them so big at the box office was tremendous as Dolly was a novice in acting.

 After many personal problems Dolly, alongside her then manager Sandy Gallin, decided it was time for her to do another movie and along came ""Rhinestone"". Publicity was huge for the movie (Sly Stallone (Dolly's co-star) and Dolly herself graced the cover of ""People"", the two had made an appearance on that year's Oscars together and the soundtrack was going to feature songs written by Dolly.

 The movie came out and it bombed at the box office. This had nothing to do with Dolly: she tried to make the unforgettable script into something more, but couldn't. The premise was that in order for Dolly's character to get out of manager's contract she made a bet that she could turn a New York City cab driver (Stallone) into a country and western singer. If you think the story premise is bad wait until you hear Sly singing! His acting is terrible in this and his singing even worse and many say it was ""Rhinestone"" that led him to a fast decline in Hollywood.

 Since the movie flopped Dolly's album of the same name flopped as well even though there was a #1 song from the soundtrack and another Top 10 single. Dolly would state she learned a lot from making the film, Sly was kind to work with and that as  one of the producers she had lost a lot of money on it.

 Buy the movie, not because it's good, but because Dolly is in it, she makes the best of a worst situation and she sounds and looks great!",1375315200,2,1695,4.355555555555555

Maybe that's why my opinion of the movie is what it is. The movie itself though is no great surprise. Dolly Parton is basically playing herself, Stallone is also basically playing himself. Everyone writes at how horrible Sly's singing is, no kidding, it's supposed to be bad! The premise of the movie is Dolly is an adored country singer in a club, she makes a bet that she can turn anyone into a country singer. Enter Stallone as a New York cab driver. She takes him back home to Tennessee and tries to teach him how to be ""country"". He struggles with the whole concept, the walk, the talk, the singing. At no point during the movie are you supposed to believe that he CAN sing, nor are you supposed to believe that he's become ""country"". If you like Dolly, you will love her in this movie. She pretty much just plays herself thruout. Her songs are great, she wrote all of the songs in the movie with one exception. The only song she didn't write is the wickedly funny ""The Day My Baby Died"" which is also a favorite of mine. Look, the movie is no ""Gone With The Wind"", it doesn't pretend to be.

Dolly sings some good self-penned songs, but some of the Stallone songs are simply ludicrous. Buy the soundtrack, but skip this cinematic mess. One reviewer states that the whole point is that Stallone is not a country singer. But the whole premise hinges on a  bet a night club owner makes with Dolly that she can turn a person that he picks into a viable singer. At the end of the film, Dolly and Sly perform two numbers. Stallone is as  bad a performer as he was at the start of the movie, but the highly critical crowd turns from jeering to cheering. Sly passes the test and Dolly wins the bet!

No one ever accused Stallone of being able to act, but at least with most of his films (the Rocky series and Rambo series) you know what you are in for when you buy your ticket (or turn on your DVD player). After this ludicrous film no one will ever accuse him of being able to sing either. A mind-numbingly horrible film, one sits and watches mezmerized by its sheer awfulness. Surprisingly, however, Stallone does not come off as the worst thing in the film - that ""honor"" goes to Ron Liebman. A comedy needs a clever script, and a director and actors with a sense of comic timing. This mess has none of these. At least with Stallone's so-called action films there is noise and things blowing up to divert you from the mediocrity. Rhinestone just has itself.",1366156800,3,849,4.4423076923076925

(Edited review - You are not going to recieve what is being asked price wise for this movie. Especially when there are so many other outlets that it can be obtained for $7.40 - $9.96 - $5.20[Just unsure of product carrier is all] and so on and so forth. You must be reasonable with your prices. This was not even an academy awarded class movie. And can be watched for free online most places. I shop on amazon for a reason, this however makes me gringe to see the blistering prices people place on devalued items. And remember DVD is going to be obsolete with blu-ray and other devices coming into prominence. So please be reasonable!)I love this movie and think that it is a good film, all things considered. I would love to add it to my collection of thousands of movies. But in a realistic tone, it put simply is over priced, way over priced. I am constantly gathering movies from this time era and I can say that this and one other I have searched for are the most outrageously priced. 10$ would be top rate price all things being considered especially in todays society and economic crunch. I think it is a great movie and doesn't deserve the negative reviews it recieved. I just think the price is ridiculous. I am sure we could find it in some shop for 5 bucks like we do with so many others. or watch for free online if necessary. I would rather not, but this is why people do that. I understand the reasoning behind it, but it is unrealistic and out of line. Rhinestone is good movie, not 50 or 80 $ movie.",1339718400,,1522,4.321678321678322

Move over Rocky Balboa here's Nick Martinelli. Sylvester Stallone is absolutely hillarious
in this film. I watched this film when it first came out and I enjoyed it as much as I did then.
I played it and even my middle nephew thought it was funny. I laughed so hard--especially when
he was ""pickin'"" fun at Barnette Kale.

The music is good and but most of all Sylvester is soooooooo entertaining. I know that I highly
recommend anyone to watch this film. I do give you a warning not to eat too much popcorn because
you will laugh in some segments so hard that it just might come right back up.

635666,4,6303394353,"I first saw this movie when I was a little kid in '84. I am in my early thirties now and I still enjoy it. A lot of people ragged on Sly for being in this movie but as a true Sly fan, I thought it was a cool choice. I think a lot of action fans were upset he decided to dip into a different genre which brings on the backlash of Rhinestone. Please! I am so sick of people saying this movie is terrible when I could name about a million other movies that are horrible in comparison to this. This isn't even the worst film Dolly or Sly have been in. Remember ""Stop or My Mom Will Shoot"" and ""Straight Talk""??? YIKES! Both of them did much worse than Rhinestone down the line.

Rhinestone may not be drop dead funny but it's entertaining. Sly and Dolly have good chemistry and Dolly has tons of charm. They made a cute couple and the chemistry alone makes you sit through this ""horrible"" movie. This movie is for people who want to have a little fun and enjoy some laidback entertainment. It's not for film snobs who think every movie someone should make is supposed to be a blockbuster. Get real! Actors can choose the movies they want to do and obviously Dolly and Sly wanted to do this one. It's been over 20 years and people are still whinning about Rhinestone and how bad it is!  Snobs won't like it because they don't understand that it wasn't meant to be the greatest movie in the world. It was a cute little 80's movie!  Over half of the movies in the 80's were crap!  Let's not forget other bombs of the 80's, Night Shift, The Babysitter is Dead, Look Who's Talking and I could go on and on.

So if you haven't seen this movie and don't expect it to be Sly kicking someone's butt every five minutes, you'll enjoy. But if you sit there expecting not to like it, you won't. And if you're a film snob then go watch something else. This is for those who are fans of Dolly and Sly. I think Sly shows  his versatility in this film. He wanted to do a comedy. Arnold Schwarzegger did a line of BOMB comedies, yet everyone gets hot about Stallone and Rhinestone. If it bothers you that much you should get a life. A lot of people enjoy this movie and the others can deal with it.",1260144000,,2176,4.169047619047619
635667,2,6303394353,"I love everything Dolly Parton does. She has been my idol since I was a little boy, but ""Rhinestone"" is without a doubt the worst project Dolly ever did. The walls of 20th Century Fox shook when the boxoffice results came in for this turkey as it was one of the studio's worst flops. What makes the film so bad is not only a poor script, but Sly Stallone. While watching the movie I cringe everytime I see Sly in his scenes. He thinks he's being funny, but he comes off looking totally stupid. And as far as his singing goes...plug your ears. Dolly did the best she could with a terrible script, but her music is what salvages some of the film. The soundtrack has become Dolly's most rarest CD recording, with copies going for several hundred dollars on auction sites, and the DVD version of the movie has become a collector's item as Anchor Bay, who released the film, stopped producing copies of it a few years before. Buy the movie only if you are a true Dolly fan; besides that look elsewhere for a good comedy. The just of the film says it all...Sylvester Stallone as a singing cowboy! Please!

635669,2,6303394353,"Most of the reviewers have said well enough about how good or bad this movie is. Stallone cannot sing, no matter how well produced the film is, no matter how they silken his voice and no matter how much they embellish the rest of the music - he just cannot carry a tune. And that would probably be easily guessed by even the most casual movie watcher.

Parton, as always, looks great, although I am not a fan of her music, I am a fan of her ""visual style"". Otherwise, the movie is pretty much a fish-out-of-water tale, by taking a New York cab driver and get him to be a country singer by hooking one of the hardest crowds around.

Too many questions come up during this movie regarding plot, such as 'Are we in New York or Tenessee?' or 'How does a country club in New York survive when all of the talent gets laughed off stage?' and many others that, for the most part are not even worth trying to answer.

The only thing that begs questioning is that the credits state the movie is based on the popular country song ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" by Larry Weiss, but not once is it played in the movie. I don't know if the DVD cut out the song for rights purposes, or if it never made the final cut of the movie. But why bother giving credit if its not even represented?

Oh well. With that, the only other curiosity is that this film is directed by Bob Clark, who directed A Christmas Story, Porky's, Turk 182, among other cult films.

Overall, it is a cheesy 80's flick that can be unintentionally funny, but otherwise an irritating film.",1233964800,,1532,4.305555555555555
635670,3,6303394353,"As Sylvester Stallone's film acting career winds down, I get all nostalgic and tend to look more favorably even at his clunkers. Case in point, this film. When you think of legendary screen pairings, you don't think much of Sly Stallone and Dolly Parton. Yet, here they are, in RHINESTONE, a Pygmalion-like romantic comedy. Back in the day (that would be 1984), Sly had just done ROCKY III and FIRST BLOOD, his star ascending like a mothereffer. RHINESTONE was a change of pace for Sly and his first attempt not only at comedy but at romantic comedy, and when I first saw it during its theatrical run, I was stunned, and not in a good way. But I've seen this flick a number of times since then, and while familiarity does breed contempt, sometimes it also takes the edge off that initial pang of ""What The Eff Is This!""

It's a bare-bones premise: With more than just her contract on the line, a country western singer makes a bet with her creepy horndog manager that she can turn anyone into a country western star within two weeks. She ends up stuck with a coarse New York cabbie and brings him to her Tennessee home for the hasty tutorial on hillbilly. After which, he has to perform before (and survive) a tough, rowdy crowd at a popular New York honkytonk nightclub.

So what's more horribly fish-out-of-water than Sly stranded in backwoods Tennessee while striving to channel his inner hick? Where even the local hayseeds remark that ""He's slow-witted, ain't he?"" Sly's brash cabbie doesn't dig country music, thinking it ""worse than liver,"" and, yeah, when he tries to sing country I tend to agree with him. He talks and sings like he has marbles in his mouth and, on stage, twitchy dude needs to take some Calm Down pills. But the biggest flaw is that the characters in the movie, in the end, seem to buy into Sly being a credible singer (Dolly's manager even sounds him out about a contract). Sly co-writes the screenplay and he throws in so many bad caricature moments that the film was destined for universal panning. Dolly Parton is sweet and can really sing but her presence can't balance out the cliched cornpone and pasta.

And yet, much to my shame, the last few times I've seen RHINESTONE, I've enjoyed the watching of it. The caveat, I think, is that you have to like the two leads some, or, else, you'll only get the bejesus irked out of you. If you like Dolly Parton, then it's fine, because she's good in her typecast role. If you like Stallone, then you might get a kick out of watching him attempt a southern drawl and a jock itch strut and also his being all gigged out in gaudy attire (and I'm not even referring to his country-western outfits, but his normal 1980s wear). The ""Drinkenstein"" scene (in which a rainbow throws up on him) happens to be one of my favorite Stallone moments ever. Although the funniest song is probably ""The Day My Baby Died,"" belted out by that face-scarred would-be cowpoke singer. And, for folks who dig the TRANCERS series, Jack Deth himself (Tim Thomerson) has a supporting role as Dolly's ex (but he loses some man points by getting clocked by Dolly).

In the Stallone comedy ouevre, this one isn't as large a suckfest as STOP! OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT but not as good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oscar/dp/B00008979E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oscar</a>. RHINESTONE is a train wreck, yep, but the weird dichotomy is that its backhanded saving grace is also what capsizes it, namely Sylvester Stallone as country singer. Me, I ended up placing this flick on the Guilty Pleasure shelf of my DVD collection. It really all depends on if you can be forgiving enough, of the cheese and stereotypes and ""Hopalong Meatball""'s mugging and shatteringly bad singing (which to me is what makes the ""Drinkenstein"" song so awesome).

It's from neither Shakespeare nor Jane Austen, but I dig the lyrics: ""Budweiser, you created a monster. And they call me Drinkenstein. And they call me Drinkensteeeein!""

And what the heck is he doing making a film with Dolly Parton, right?  Well, I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a sense of humor.  Yes, it's an 80's flick, but still, it is full of hilarity!",1216857600,,478,3.836734693877551

635742,5,6303394353,"This is the funniest movie with two very big stars in it.  I don't think it ever really made it big, but I absolutely loved it.  It made me extremely happy to find it on amazon at such a wonderful price.  The movie is about Dolly Parton who plays a country singer of course who has to teach Stallone an Italian New York City taxi cab driver how to become and look like a county singer.  Abracadabra!  Dolly decides to show him some real country roots and take him back home to her family to teach him how to be country. If she succeeds her manager will break her contract but if she looses she has to sleep with the slimey guy. (the guy playing the part is perfectly slimey too)
Funny as funny can be.  Stallone and Parton fall in love and Dolly meets her goal as Stallone wins over the crowd with his newly found country style. A Funny and entertaining love story.",1209254400,4,865,4.212121212121212
635743,5,6303394353,"Groucho Marx once wrote that he hated movies in which the leading man's chest was larger than the leading lady's. But he would have been hard-pressed to determine the, ah, biggest star in the cinematic torso-fest RHINESTONE, which pits Sylvester Stallone's overdeveloped pecs against Dolly Parton's matchless mammaries.

PORKY's director Bob Clark, perhaps realizing that his stars' considerable charms don't include acting, cast them according to type -- she as a cornpone country gal, he as an urban Italian lunk -- and yet they aren't believable even as themselves. Laughable, yes.

The plot has struggling C&W warbler Dolly betting her ample body that she can make a singin' success out of the next city slicker who passes by -- and guess who appears? We then take a very extended detour South, where Dolly teaches the Sly guy to think ""country,"" larnin' him such authentic bits of rustic lore as ""a cowboy always mixes his peas with his 'taters"" (it's how the West was won), and that a country walk is just like a city walk with ""a bad case of jock itch."" The script never lets up: ""There are two kinds of people in this world -- and you ain't one of em!"" And, ""Where are all the lepers when I need 'em?"" When our stars inevitably get together, their love scene is entirely obscured by Dolly's ... hair.

If all this doesn't sound like enough to keep your kitsch-jaded friends amused, just mention these two words: Stallone sings! Sort of like an Elvis-impersonating bullfrog with a speech impediment. That sound alone is enough to rank RHINESTONE with the classic bad star vehicles of all time",1208563200,2,1599,4.786231884057971

Even mild digs at Stallone himself as Dolly repeatedly punches out the bad guys before Sly gets a chance!

It's all good fun and a feast for fans of Dolly's singing.  Stallone does a good job of going from hopeless in the beginning to all the right moves at the end.

635793,5,6303394353,"Twenty-plus years has left this movie with a nice glow, my pee-ers.  In 1984, two years after back-to-back hits ""Rocky III"" and ""First Blood,"" and only one year after his triumph writing and directing the ""Saturday Night Fever"" sequel ""Staying Alive,"" the moviegoing public was not highly anticipating a flat-out comedy from the buff stud muffin.  But that's what they got that summer.  I, for one, was thrilled because I remembered Sly's rendition of the main theme from ""Paradise Alley"" - my man can sing!  The idea of pairing him with country-queen Dolly Parton was a masterstroke.

The story couldn't be simpler:  Dolly wants out of her contract with a sleazy manager - he agrees to release her, IF she can train a ""regular person"" of his choice to be a country singer.  The regular person turns out to be the New York City cab driver played by Sly.  She has two weeks to prepare him for his NYC debut on amatuer night at a rowdy country bar - he only needs to get through one song without being torn apart by the merciless crowd.

The screenplay, co-written by Stallone (as he wrote or co-wrote most of his films from this era), is loaded with knee-slappers.  One of the funniest parts is when Stallone wants to show Parton his ""really big organ"" (sounds dirty, but isn't).  Some of my favorite supporting characters are Freddy Ugo - Parton's sleazeball manager, and especially BARNETT CALE, who is a country singer and just an overall weird guy.  Oh, and the late Richard Farnsworth is excellent as Parton's dad.

I wish the soundtrack was available on CD, as there are some very good songs from both Ms. Parton and Mr. Stallone.  I also wish there were some bonus features on the DVD, but sadly there are not.",1147564800,14,1716,4.62046204620462

I love the music, I think Stallone was the perfect male to choose for this part, I loved him in the scene where he was wearing the pink shirt. Not all men can wear a pink shirt. Dolly is the best when it comes to country music. If you are a country music fan you must see this movie. It'll knock your socks off. It'll have you dancing in your seat. You'll laugh till your sides hurt. What more can I say its a great movie. I have watched it at least 20 times. DVD makes the sound and picture so much better. Everytime I watch it I get lost in the movie. If Iam having a bad day this movie will brighten you day. Try it I think you'll like it. Thanks Linda",1127952000,11,695,3.9361702127659575

Sly is an irreverent cabbie, picked out of the crowd by good ole Dolly and her manager to become the next big thing at a local country club. What ensues is classic 80's camp with little more than guilty fun at the expense of good taste.

The greatest part of this film is the first real Sly song, ""Drinkenstein,"" performed while wearing an outrageous get-up that is beyond the imagination. That song won the movie a much deserved Golden Raspberry as did Sly's brilliant acting performance. No extras to speak of, but who needs em.

Maybe that's why my opinion of the movie is what it is. The movie itself though is no great surprise. Dolly Parton is basically playing herself, Stallone is also basically playing himself. Everyone writes at how horrible Sly's singing is, no kidding, it's supposed to be bad! The premise of the movie is Dolly is an adored country singer in a club, she makes a bet that she can turn anyone into a country singer. Enter Stallone as a New York cab driver. She takes him back home to Tennessee and tries to teach him how to be ""country"". He struggles with the whole concept, the walk, the talk, the singing. At no point during the movie are you supposed to believe that he CAN sing, nor are you supposed to believe that he's become ""country"". If you like Dolly, you will love her in this movie. She pretty much just plays herself thruout. Her songs are great, she wrote all of the songs in the movie with one exception. The only song she didn't write is the wickedly funny ""The Day My Baby Died"" which is also a favorite of mine. Look, the movie is no ""Gone With The Wind"", it doesn't pretend to be.

Stallone also wrote the screenplay (I wouldn't admit it myself, but...) and Dolly wrote all them there songs. (Not her best work either).  But together they are a pair you just can't look away from.  Loosely based on Glen Campbell's good ole boy song ""Rhinestone Cowboy.""  The fun begins when Dolly has to train Stallone to get through one number at the bigger jigger without gettin' booed off stage.  If he succeeds then she gets to tear up her contract with her oversexed agent. Then, of course LOVE comes in, Stallone saves the day, and they have a good ol' hootin' annie at the bigger jigger.",1106438400,2,868,4.701986754966887

Critics panned it because they thought Sylvester Stallone wanted to break into the music business, not true. It's just a MOVIE! Too bad they can't tell the difference between reality and fiction. We all know he can't sing, that's why it's perfect. The casting is genius for this movie, Richard Farnsworth plays Dolly's Daddy, the laid back country gentleman we all love, Ron Leibman is the convincing womanizing creep ya gotta beat off with a stick, Tim Thomerson is the funniest one in the movie; my sides hurt from laughing so hard, even the supporting cast was perfect, and Dolly again, outdoes herself with the soundtrack.

This is a must-see movie if you want to be entertained, it's cute, it's funny, and yes, it's a love story, ok, it borders a 'chick flick'. I highly recommend it to everyone.

Tim Thomerson does a wonderful job as Dolly's ex-love. Stalone is believable as a NYC Cabbie. Dolly Parton is perfect as Sly's teacher and an absolutely excellent performance (as always) by Ron Liebman as the slimy dirt-bag club owner.
