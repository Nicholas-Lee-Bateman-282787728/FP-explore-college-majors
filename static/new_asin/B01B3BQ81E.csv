7621547,5,B01B3BQ81E,Challenging and exciting. A beautifully told story about one mans ability to continuously face his fears. Gored is a story about courage and tradition. A peek into the ancient world for a modern audience. Beautifully shot and beautifully told. I cannot wait to see this film again!,1456704000,,281,5.0
7621548,5,B01B3BQ81E,"I saw the film last year. I was the one in crowd yelling 'No! Don't risk your life again! Not worth it!'. You could feel how his wife was thinking the same thing. The best part of the movie for me  was the look in her eyes knowing she has to keep it together for one more fight. I was on the edge of my seat, Loved it!",1456704000,2,318,3.676470588235294
7621549,5,B01B3BQ81E,"I saw Gored six months ago and still remember it vividly. A beautiful, complex and sensitive portrayal of a man who is willing to die in order to fulfil his life's dream, a Don Quixote of the bullfighting world, if you will. A fantastic and truly emotional movie.",1456704000,,263,4.5
7621550,5,B01B3BQ81E,"As an animal lover, I was reluctant to watch, but the treatment of the subject couldn't have been more sensitive and smart.  One of the best documentaries I've seen in years - fascinating, smart and extremely compelling.",1456704000,,220,4.945945945945946
7621551,5,B01B3BQ81E,Totally riveting!! Lush and powerful. This film brings you right to the nostrils of the beast and into the mind of a man and his delusional determination to be a great bullfighter.,1456704000,,180,4.65625
7621552,5,B01B3BQ81E,"I've seen Gored at the NYC Doc- amazing movie!!!
beautifully crafted.",1456704000,,69,5.363636363636363
7621553,5,B01B3BQ81E,"As a wimp who avoids danger at all costs, I'm fascinated by those who live to risk their lives. While not the worlds greatest bullfighter, Barrera gets an A+ for effort and size of gonads. Because we are made aware early of his track record the film glues you to each fight. You never know how each fight will end  - not well usually. The documentary goes a long way towards explaining the mentality of a Matador but also delves in to the effect and strain such risk has on the family of a fighter. The cinematography is beautiful and the movie also benefits from excellent archival footage. Looking forward to joining Barrera for his last fight (again) on Bluray.",1454803200,3,664,4.533333333333333
7621554,4,B01B3BQ81E,"As a native Spaniard and a lifetime ""hater"" of bullfighting, I was a bit apprehensive to see this film. However I left the screening intensely moved, and with a deep respect towards Antonio Barrera, the matador. I didn't really see GORED as a film about bullfighting, but rather as a psychological character portrait of this conflicted, talented, passionate man, whose love and respect for his profession, but especially for the bulls he fights, overtakes everything else in his life. I was also surprised to, for the first time in my life, find myself considering bullfighting as much an ""art"" as a savage tradition. Ultimately a beautifully shot, complex film, full of nuance and issues/questions to be pondered.",1457395200,,714,5.111111111111111
7621555,5,B01B3BQ81E,"Gored is poetic. It's about life, it's about death. It's a dance of beautiful colors, animals and people.",1457222400,,105,4.888888888888889
7621556,5,B01B3BQ81E,"By James Toback  To say that GORED is far and away the BEST movie ever made about bull-fighting is insufficient praise indeed!  It is--apart from a uniquely truthful depiction of that controversial sport--a riveting portrait of a man ferocious in his dedication to his profession and to his family and admirably fearless in his constant facing of mortality.  The film sneaks up on you, increasing literally minute-by-minute in its addicting impact.  There is not a dull moment, only an unfolding of a poignant, socially resonant and fundamentally philosophical dramatic event.  The sudden and devastating emotional impact at the end of the film is rare in cinema--fictional or documentary.",1457136000,3,689,5.342592592592593
7621557,4,B01B3BQ81E,Well done.,1457049600,,10,4.5
7621558,5,B01B3BQ81E,"This movie had me from the opening shot...it's killer.
Though it's  hard to imagine in the abstract why a man with a family who he loves, can tempt death every time he steps into the ring. It is in the beautiful way that the film maker allows Antonio to reveal who he is more and more as the film unfolds that we come to understand the meaning behind the risk.
Fantastic job by the director/editor.",1457049600,,398,4.306666666666667
7621559,5,B01B3BQ81E,"Wonderful documentary. Direction and cinematography are a true delight, sensitive and thoughtful, bringing to light the story of a mesmerizing protagonist.",1456790400,,155,6.428571428571429
7621560,5,B01B3BQ81E,"Watching Gored, I felt I have made an intimate encounter with a man who is willing to dedicate his life to make his dream come true. As someone who values life over dreams, I feel this man is an example of bravery and honesty.",1456790400,,226,4.159090909090909
7621561,5,B01B3BQ81E,"Cinematically colorful and beautiful, GORED takes us into the bullring and life of Antonio as he practices a vanishing and old world artform. This is a man who chooses to dare death and we wonder how he can repeatedly face the bull and how he can live if he doesn't.",1456790400,,266,4.34
7621562,5,B01B3BQ81E,"Fantastic - it's about a ""sport"" I abhor yet I was drawn in and fascinated by the film and its humanity.",1456790400,,104,4.0
7621563,5,B01B3BQ81E,"This is a brave movie, with endless sensitivity to human inclinations, urges and drives. Gored confronts the viewer with their own morality,
fears and doubts, telling the story of the most gored matador in history. Barrera is sometimes frighteningly intensive, not a
simple pill to swallow, and fascinating nevertheless. One of the most interesting things about watching this film is how such a controversial theme, that obviously raises many questions and objections, is transformed into a love story between a man and his bull, a man and his family, and a man and himself, and becomes something that is hard to ignore. Very recommended",1456704000,,637,5.134615384615385
8749192,5,B01B3BQ81E,"It's hard to believe how much punishment a body can take and keep on truckin'.  This matador is as much about luck as anything else.  Other matadors would have been killed or ruined during the course of such a 'gored' career.  Even more interesting is this man's philosophy about personal death.  It is unimportant.  He doesn't play with death.  He willingly accepts its reality, even its beauty.  He waxes mystical about having his femoral artery ripped by a bull and the fact that he very nearly died.  He does have concern for his family but he cares nothing for his own death, which places him in an impossible position.  He must retire for the sake of his family but he hates the prospect of not facing the bulls again and testing the limits of his own survival.

I have seen many corridas but never before have I seen the incredible ""La Puerta de Muerto"" or whatever it is called.  Granted it's Hollywood hotdog but if you are going to 'Hollywood' it up, this is the way to do it.  One thousand lbs of angry hatred right in your face.  Life or death?  Whatever floats your boat.",1515369600,,1084,4.464285714285714
8749193,5,B01B3BQ81E,Excellent movie and very well done. It is worth watching,1515110400,,56,4.7
8749194,1,B01B3BQ81E,"Movie didn't work properly, subtitles were for a michael vic dog fighting movie.....  Unwatchable",1514764800,3,97,5.928571428571429
8749195,5,B01B3BQ81E,Love bullfighting movies,1485993600,,24,7.333333333333333
8749196,5,B01B3BQ81E,"Great documentary.....I loved it!  As a bullfighting aficionado, I appreciated how the film gets into mindset of the matador, the dignity with which he faces incredible danger every time he steps into the ring, and the elastic beauty of the world of bullfighting (albeit brutal).  Extraordinary film!",1459382400,3,300,5.361702127659575
8749197,5,B01B3BQ81E,"Beautifully filmed, Gored tells the incredible story of one man's commitment to being a Matador. His passion for the sport and his devotion to his craft brings him into the ring time and time again in an attempt to tame the untamable bull.  As the movie explains, he is the most Gored man to date, but that doesn't stop him. It's not your typical film about bull fighting but rather a compassionate and beautiful story of the hero's journey. It's a must see!",1458691200,,458,4.518072289156627
8749198,5,B01B3BQ81E,This film was very captivating.  To see the main character's determination to be the bravest was courageous in and of itself.,1458000000,,125,4.9523809523809526
8749199,5,B01B3BQ81E,"GORED is a beautifully rendered film and is a love story indeed.  It is a visually stunning movie that had me gripped at the first frame.  The film is perfectly paced, allowing the viewer time to feel and notice their reactions as the movie unfolds.  GORED tells the story of the most gored bullfighter in history and weaves together incredible footage of his time as a matador with one on one interviews with Antonio, his family and other bullfighters.  Antonio is shown preparing for some of his bullfights with such a sense of mindfulness and respect for his craft that I was immediately drawn into caring and respecting Antonio.  He is a thoroughly interesting study in contrasts;  passionate and kind (zipping up his son's jacket in one of the earlier moments of the film) as well as relentless and intense.  Antonio's thoughts and observations on family, love, fame, relentless pursuit of his passion are different and fresh.  The film covers some of the larger issues associated with bullfighting but this film in the end is a love story, between a man and his passion, and how this particular man risks it all to fill his soul.",1457913600,,1135,4.755102040816326
8749200,5,B01B3BQ81E,Fascinated look at death.  This is not a film about bull fighting it's a film about one man's struggle with coming to terms with mortality.,1457913600,,139,4.56
8749201,5,B01B3BQ81E,An incredible look at a world typically shrouded in mystery. Eye-opening and riveting.,1457568000,,86,5.6923076923076925
