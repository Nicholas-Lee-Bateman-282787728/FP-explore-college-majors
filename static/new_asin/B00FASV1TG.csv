8613897,4,B00FASV1TG,"I missed my roll on the biggest rapid of my life this past fall.  It was clear that I needed a tune up.  EJs video has provided a fresh way of practing my roll his common sense methods and short chapters of video instruction have given me a few new tools to try.  I gave the head-on-the-back-deck position a try (instead of the head-at-my-side) and could feel how easily it was to right my boat and come up.  I like EJs hard line, too.  He says that nothing ever prevents you from getting your roll on the river.  If you swim, it's because you panicked and chose to swim instead of roll.  The video not only covers components of the roll but of ways to sharpen your mental game, too.  The only thing better than the video would be to be rolling with EJ in person. Paddling season can't get here soon enough.",1420243200,,807,4.228758169934641
