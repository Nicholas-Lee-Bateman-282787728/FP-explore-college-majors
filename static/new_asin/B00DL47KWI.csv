5827019,5,B00DL47KWI,"I absolutely loved the movie.  I thought it was clever and creative and I was laughing out loud at parts.

I'll admit, I'm biased towards the casting - I'm a huge Darren fan to begin with, from Glee to Starkid to his music.  But Kristen Wiig, Matt Dillon, and Annette Bening are all fantastic as well :).",1376352000,4,304,4.298245614035087
5827020,4,B00DL47KWI,"Went to see the movie at the local art cinema. Was pleasantly surprised that it was a sweet, sensitive movie. I completely enjoyed it and would recommend it.",1375833600,5,157,4.642857142857143
5827021,2,B00DL47KWI,"""Girl Most Likely"" showed up pretty much unannounced a couple of weekends ago at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati, but I had heard and read pretty much only negative things about this movie and stayed away. Having seen that it is STILL playing at that same theatre, curiosity got the better of me and I finally went to see it.

""Girl Most Likely"" (2013 release; 103 min.) brings the story of Imogene (played by Kirsten Wiig), a thirty-something woman in New York who is down on her luck. As the movie opens, we see how first she is dumped by Peter, her boyfriend of many years, and then how she is fired from her job as a magazine writer. In sheer desperation to try and win Peter back, Imogene fakes a suicide try (including a fake farewell note, written so well that Imogene later comments ""I could be a professional suicide writer!"", by far the best line in the movie). Rather than Peter coming back, Imogene, after a short hospital stay, ends up being released into the custody of Zelda, her gambling-addicted mom (played by Annette Bening) and moves in with her back in Ocean City, NJ. Turns out Zelda has rented out Imogene's room to Lee, a twenty-something singer who performs in a cheesy casino play. Zelda's boyfriend (played by Matt Dillon) thinks/claims he is a CIA operative and goes by 'George Bush'. There is also Imogene's brother and dad who have a fringe role. At that point we are about 30 min. into the movie and the table is pretty much set for these wacky character to play out their roles. Will Peter and Imogene get back together? Can Imogene and her mom finally get along? To tell you more would be, well...

Several comments: I am generally speaking quite finicky in choosing the movies that I go see, and if I know beforehand there is little chance I will not like the movie, I won't go. With this movie, my curiosity was peaked because (i) it is playing for several weeks at my local art-house theatre, so obviously people are seeing it, otherwise it'd be gone already, (ii) I had low expectations going in, and (iii) it's freakin' Kirsten ""Bridesmaids"" Wiig, so how bad can it really be? Not to mention that Wiig also executive-produced this movie, so surely she had more than a hand in the final product. Alas, I am sorry to tell you that all the rumors are true. This is supposed to be a comedy, and do you want to know how many times I laughed? Not a single time, I mean not even a chuckle! This is all the more surprising, given that this was directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, who are more than capable. The most likely explanation is that the script was outright weak, beyond the point of salvage. About 80-85 min. into the movie, there is a plot twist (don't worry, I won't reveal) that is so out-of-nowhere and so weak, that I was utterly bewildered and exasperated. I decided to leave the theatre right then and there, as I had already spent too much time with this movie.

Wiig, Bening and others may try as hard as they can, but they cannot save this witless and flat-lined movie from the dud that it is. What a tremendous waste of talent! In all honesty, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, not even Wiig die-hards. Save yourself the trouble, the time and your money, and check out something else instead (such as the underrated and actually excellent ""Friends With Kids"" from last year, also starring Wiig). As to ""Girl Most Likely"", viewer beware!",1375056000,5,3426,4.531502423263328

5827122,5,B00DL47KWI,The Girl Most Likely illustrated the complex human dynamics while also maintaining a sense of heartwarming flutters by the end. A tale of how life can go in a different direction when you least expect it and whether you desire it to or not.,1515888000,,240,4.4772727272727275

5827197,1,B00DL47KWI,"This film aspires to much but fails at everything. Just plain awful. I gave it 45 laughless minutes and bailed. I frankly don't understand Kirsten Wilg's appeal, but that's just me. In this particular movie, I can identify very well with the people in her character's life who want her to be out of theirs. I'd want to be rid of her, too. Don't waste your time.",1512000000,,361,4.402985074626866

5827199,5,B00DL47KWI,"I don't know how I never heard about this very delightful movie. The cast is super funny. Matt Dillon as Annette Benning's boyfriend just really takes the cake. Everyone though plays their roles so amazingly well. I just love Kristen Wiig, who is the girl who sees her high society relationship end with practically zero warning. Suddenly she has to move back home to live with her mom and her boyfriend, a younger brother and a boarder who took her childhood bedroom.

Wiig is on an immediate quest to just get away and back into her old life, and to find her father who she is sure will save her. This part was bittersweet and stoked in reality. As whacky as this movie is, it really actually is fairly true to life on many levels.

My stomach and face hurt from laughing so hard at many scenes. Annette Benning does an outstanding job as Wiig's mom. And her brother who creates his real life sized crab shell, just warms the heart. And what I LOVE about this movie is the Heart and Soul of the movie. The boardwalk singer (Zach?) who shows Kristen that she really has a lot to be Thankful for. And that the ""glamorous life"" ain't all it's cracked up to be. In the end, Home is really where the Heart is. A truly realistic movie with a great message. Not to be missed. Highly enjoyable!!!",1509580800,,1290,4.393305439330544
5827200,5,B00DL47KWI,One of the funniest movies every! Had to pause it when I could not stop laughing. From beginning to end this was one of the best movies I have seen in quite some time.

5827245,5,B00DL47KWI,"Kristen Wiig, Annette Benning, Matt Dillon. I thought it was funny. Different kind of story.

5827247,5,B00DL47KWI,"This was my total New York City experience.  I am a writer and I love literature and had a super wealthy best friend who threw me away.  She was talent-less.  When I watched the dynamic with the friend and her friends my heart thudded to a halt.  I also lived on the Jersey Shore and really enjoyed the experience.  Back in New York and have a much more grounded group now.  Really love Queens.  This is not so much a movie review as a description of how much this movie parallels one New York City/New Jersey reality.  I'm happy report there is more than one.  And that this is one of my favorite movies, for all the reality and heart and humor and Kristin Wiig and her brother and Darren Kriss and Annette Benning and Matt Dillon.  Seriously awesome movie.

5827249,3,B00DL47KWI,"likely presentation of East Coast ""culture"" consisting of egregious overpopulation mostly treating each other as the infringements that they are.  In its own strange way, this film makes it easier to understand how such a population enabled the sonofaBush to create his massive and ongoing set of felonious abrogations of American human and civil rights throughout the country beginning from knocking down a couple of their tall buildings on ""911"" and attributing it to ""foreigners"".",1502496000,,483,5.44

5827252,4,B00DL47KWI,"I was really surprised at how deeply felt and sweet this movie was.  It seemed to be marketed as a comedy, but it was really a lot more than that.  Actually there weren't so many laughs as much as there were life lessons, character complexities, quirky dysfunctional family drama and bizarre situations.  Kristen Wiig is fine as a washed-up playwright whose life has imploded, but it is really Annette Bening who steals the show with her emotionally complex performance as the estranged mother with a gambling problem and a much younger, mysterious boyfriend played by Matt Dillon.

A sub-plot involving Dillon's character (is he really a spy or just pretending?) over-steps the point of credulity, but it all works together for good in the end.  The romantic sub-plot involving Wiig's character and Darren Criss also seems a bit manufactured to move the plot along, but it works in its own way as well.  Overall, this is not a movie to go to for big laughs, but if you can appreciate more subtle comedy with a huge slice of heartwarming story, this movie is worth checking out.",1501718400,6,1078,4.768817204301075

A quirky story that is well written and fun. I do wish it had been longer. I would have liked to see the process of her getting back on her feet, seen what happened to her brother and his invention. Did she get with the guy and what happens to him? He went to Yale so he should move beyond the job he has.

This movie can't seem to figure itself out in a way... it's marketed as a comedy, but definitely strikes romance, action, drama, and even has some musical aspects? But genre aside, it's an interesting mishmash of story, and has an unpredictable storyline that keeps you entertained.

She does the same in this movie and is supported by a great cast including Annette Benning and Matt Dillon.

I've seen Annette Bening in films for years. Matt Dillon is just a name to me. I never watched the tv show he was in.  None of them gave outstanding performances in this film.  Because none of those people mean enough to me to make me want this DVD, why did I buy it?  Just one name - Darren Criss.  The only bright spots were his scenes.  That being said, the film itself is just sad and depressing. Getting dumped by a boyfriend and then staging a suicide is a cry for help.  Being a compulsive gambler is sad.

In the end I think the reason the movie wasn't as good as it could have been was with herself. Her character didn't have any other feeling besides misery.  Times that could evoked more joy and emotion on her part just ended up dreary and it negated the comedy.,1436918400,,437,4.395061728395062

She is funny but not overly funny and the cast and the twist that the story takes works very well and lend an air of coolness to an otherwise slow movie film. I love Darren Criss in it and must admit that he is the reason I even gave this film a chance to begin with. It was a little weird to see the relationship that played out between these characters cause of the real life age differences (he 28, she 41) but then again you forget about real life watching the movie because there is only the real life in which the characters in the film are living and I would therefore call that a success.

It has a little bit of sappy to it, but it still makes you laugh either way. Matt Dillon is one of those characters that makes you question if he is telling the truth or if he is just being a sponge.

It is funny with some drama as well.  The story is a NYC girl is dumped and makes an attempt to get her ex boyfriend back.  While doing this she ends up back at her childhood home in New Jersey.

It seems to try to be funny but Wiig's character is not intended to be funny and so the humor doesn't gel.  I guess that was the intention.  Left me confused because various aspects were just too unlikely and far-fetched, probably trying to be funny, but the joke doesn't materialize.

Starts off strong with Kristin Wiig's interesting portrayal of a thirty-something dealing with life's disappointments, but then veers into the absurd as an unrealistic climactic resolution is forced on the audience.

5829580,3,B00DL47KWI,"I enjoyed this movie. It was fun and not too predictable. More  interesting and entertaining than most romantic comedies. I don't remember bad language and there is only one bedroom scene-so it is watchabe with your mom.  I loved that the lead actress stayed in her high school clothes after she moved home. It maybe tries a little too hard by delving into a complicated father daughter relationship, but so much better than most  of the films today that resort to borderline porn and bathroom humor to get an audience. Get some popcorn and enjoy.",1420329600,,547,4.7368421052631575

In the second half of this movie, every scene just feels like it's been lifted from some other movie or old SNL skit.

This is a self-discovery journey with a difference - every single characters is just a little bit nuts, flawed and loveable in their own way, but together they make a pretty awesome family! The small side of romance adds heart and interest, but doesn't detract from what essentially is one woman's journey to rediscovering herself after she becomes lost in the falsity of her NYC social circle.",1413936000,2,461,4.987012987012987

I loved it, no, it is not a chick flick... Bridesmaids it is not, but why should she be typecast just because she starred and produced 1 of the most successful, intelligent female ensemble movies script and script of all time? This is an entirely different genre of acting & films. Well thought, poignant, funny, sad, awkward but lovable. the supporting cast was well rounded by Annette Benning who I loved the chemistry between her and Wiig as Mother/Daughter in reverse. Would've loved more of that but the film worked well. The other cast, Dillon, Criss and her brother( forgot name) was pertinent to the story and nicely played. I really enjoyed the movie and was nicely surprised.

Imogene is struggling with a break up, losing her job, and the realization she might not have any real friends.

During her stay she reconnects with her brother, begins to understand her past, and makes a startling realization about her father.

Girl Most Likely touches on what it's like to have failed, to try, and to succeed. Kristen Wiig's character is a clever representation of the every-girl.

5830237,3,B00DL47KWI,"If Amazon allowed half-star ratings I would give ""Girl Most Likely"" two-and-a-half stars. Kristen Wiig is good but not great as Imogene, an up and coming New York City writer who is forced by circumstances to stay with her (seemingly) oddball family in New Jersey. The concept for these kinds of movies is hardly new, so much of their value lies in their casting and in the execution of the genre's tropes. In this case it's a mixed bag.

Annette Benning, who I have never considered to be that great an actress, really shines as Zelda, Imogene's impulsive and anxious mother. The trope of the wacky mother that the protagonist of the story is trying to get away from is easily overdone but Benning manages to make the character flawed and funny, but without being cartoonish. Christopher Fitzgerald's turn as Imogene's hermit crab obsessed brother, Ralph, lacks such nuance but, surprisingly, leads to some of the most endearing moments of the final act of the film. Matt Dillion plays the Bousche, Benning's live-in boyfriend and a putative secret agent. Darren Criss rounds out the cast as Lee, the Back Street Boy tribute singer cum love interest.

""Girl Most Likely"" is not a straightforward romantic comedy. Instead, it is intended to be a funny drama--a character piece with some laughs along the way. The movie is nothing like ""Bridesmaids,"" but is closer in tone to Adam Sandler's ""Spanglish."" Kristen Wiig's character is, in many ways, unlikeable. Perhaps this is because Wiig lacks the breezy charm of Drew Barrymore or the sardonic girl next door quality of Tina Fey, but it struck me that the problem lies more with the writing than the performance or direction.

The movie does a good job of setting Imgoene up as someone who has a high opinion of herself while being blind to her own neediness, but it fails to pay that off at the end by having her realize this truth about herself. The basic problem of ""Girl Most Likely"" is that Imogene's character arc is cut short, and it makes the inciting event of the movie (Imogene faking a suicide attempt to get attention from her ex-boyfriend) rather cruel. By not having her reflect on it, the movie gives a tacit endorsement of the character's choice to do something this horrible.

Nevertheless, the movie is entertaining and has some nice--if random--character pay-offs for the other people in the movie. My recommendation is: if you are a fan of Kristen Wiig or just looking for an entertaining movie for an evening rent ""Girl Most Likely"" but don't buy it.",1412121600,,2521,4.8018433179723505

5830246,3,B00DL47KWI,"2  stars.  Gosh, this seems to have everything going for it.  Some of my favorite people, themes.  ***SPOILERS FOLLOW***  And yet... I gave quite a bit of thought as to why this didn't work for me and finally concluded that the chief problem is that Wiig isn't convincing as someone who is hurt, damaged, or wronged because she's 1) deceitful (e.g., feigns suicide) and, 2) too clever, wise-cracking, ready with a witty comeback whatever happens, from beginning to end.  In other words, she's difficult to root for because she never seems like an underdog, seems pretty much fine, though a little cranky, and, doesn't seem much better than the people who wronged her.

Plus the film is quirky for quirky's sake and the outcomes too pat (fame, fortune, and loves that magically materialize for both Wiig and her brother).  Regardless, I think I would've liked it anyway had Wiig seemed more... pathetic, devastated.  What I'm trying to say is that she gave a one-note performance, played it the same throughout (the script's fault).  She should've suffered a nosedive after her fiance dumped her and her friends proved disloyal, been ashamed of having to return home to mommy (instead she just seemed to look down her nose at her mother, faulting her mother instead of her own shallowness and poor judgment).  It would've been easier to care about her and root for her if she'd FOUNDERED along the line.  The tone was set by the fake suicide attempt.  The only thing I liked about her character was the solicitude, tenderness she displayed towards her oddball brother.  And I liked the scene near the end where she doesn't have time to talk to the famous producers, that was a nice touch.

One can't help but contrast this with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridesmaids/dp/B005KL3R6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridesmaids</a>, in which she screws up again and again, her self-respect and prospects growing ever more dim, she's HAPLESS, and you can't help but glory in the ending, her redemption.

The main thing that struck me in watching this film is that it's easy to critique a movie once it's made.  I often wonder how they sound when pitched, or how the script reads.  I have no idea whether some of my criticisms of completed films would've been apparent to me upon reading the script (maybe not).  I'll bet I would've thought this a winner on paper (her mom's nutjob/CIA boyfriend WAS a nice comic element, and Matt Dillon did a great job [as did all the supporting actors], but I think the other ideas probably looked better on paper than they actually played).  Just barely worth seeing I think, so-so.",1411689600,,2656,5.006833712984054

I understand it showed him still getting his life together but with a fairly level head but sometimes it just seems awkward that he's younger. But that's the point I guess.

The adult character just really did not seem as smart and clever as her back-story child. Of course, if she was, we would not have this mediocre movie.

The premise of the plot and some of the scenes were ridiculous and unbelievable. However, the dialog and filming were so good that you wanted to believe that this could really happen. Shortly into the movie you are hooked, and believability becomes secondary, replaced by sympathy for the characters, and wishing that it really could happen.

It has rich visual background humor that pops up every few minutes - for example, the CIA agent with a coffee mug with big letters saying""CIA"".

This is just something to watch for fun. It is a comedy, but contains a certain amount of the reality of life that is a little bit sad. However, in the end, the strength of the characters comes through, and ends on a very high note",1406592000,,743,4.613636363636363

This movie has a great cast, but I have no clue what they are doing here or how they got attached to this project. Why is this movie bad? It's a) not funny and b) tries too hard. It's filled with clichs, including an obnoxious girl who learns the value of family, a mother who constantly embarrasses her child and an emotionally distant father. There's also the mentally ill brother who loves mollusks and the mother's boyfriend, who thinks he's a time traveling Samurai who works for the CIA. If this sounds awesome to you, then this is your movie. But for the rest of us, it's a hard movie to like. It's very predictable, right down to the fact that the crazy faux CIA agent will turn out to be -- wait for it -- an actual CIA agent, even if that makes no sense. Yes, it's a comedy, but the movie lacks any sort of internal logic or emotional resonance. It won't make you laugh, cry or react at all. Instead, you will sit there in stunned silence wondering who made this film, why, and why in the world you chose to watch it.

5831332,1,B00DL47KWI,"Kristen Wiig could not save this film. Remember in Bridesmaids how her character Annie was so intolerable and self-absorbed, before she turned things around and grew up a little? Well, all of those same attributes = her character in this movie. I wanted to like it and give it a fair shot, which is why I didn't turn it off after 20 minutes, but I couldn't even sit through an hour. Annette Bening is usually awesome, but in this film she's a cliche trainwreck mom. Like, they seriously belabor the point.. we get it, she was a crappy mom and she's so quirky and free-spirited or whatever.

The beginning is a bit hard to watch as we are introduced to the characters and get settled into the story. But, stick with it because it's actually quite sweet and you'll be happy you watched it.

5831357,4,B00DL47KWI,"Overall I thought it was a good movie for what it was.  Certinaly not an oscar conender, but mildly entertaining.  Despite moving slow in some parts, it kept me interested the entire time.  Some funny parts, some endearing, some madning, some sweet, some dramatic. It had a little bit of everything.  I like Kristin Wigg and Annett Benning so for me, it was a decent movie.  I watched it ""free"" because I'm a prime member, but even if you paid the $4.99, I don't think you'd be entirly dissapointed.  I'd say give it a shot.",1403740800,,524,4.463157894736842

5831383,3,B00DL47KWI,"This movie was just about what I expected. K.W. being rejected, awkward and playing the victim. SNL showed that she's a versatile comedic actress but each role is identical. Just an okay movie with a few laughs sprinkled here and there.",1403740800,,236,4.780487804878049
5831384,4,B00DL47KWI,This movie was surprisingly good and fun to watch. A dysfunctional family and supporting characters will have you wondering why you hadn't watched the film before.,1403740800,,163,5.3076923076923075
5831385,2,B00DL47KWI,All I can say about this movie is it is the one where you wonder afterwards why you wasted2 hours of your life. There really wasn't a plot because it was so random. The resolution was not real clear.,1403740800,,199,4.128205128205129
5831386,2,B00DL47KWI,I actually did not finish this movie so my review probably should not count - but I was just sooooo bored. How is this even a real movie with real actors? I love Darren Criss in Glee but even he could not keep me from getting up and turning the tv off. Even Kristen Wiig looks bored to death. Would not recommend.,1403654400,,313,4.064516129032258
5831387,5,B00DL47KWI,a delightful movie about family and what really matters in life. Juxtaposes the phoniness of class and money versus the truth and stability of family and home.,1403654400,,159,4.925925925925926

5831410,3,B00DL47KWI,"Definitely not award worthy, but it kept my attention for most of the movie. In typical Kristen Wiig fashion, there is a lot of dry humor and shes the mild-mannered star who is full of sarcasm and pulls a crazy antic or two every so often throughout the movie. Its worth a view if you are just looking for something to kill a few hours, but nothing I would shell out more than a few bucks to rent.",1403568000,,397,4.102564102564102

5831446,5,B00DL47KWI,"I love Kristen Wiig- and her name caught my eye, which lead me to watch this film. Having no previous insight to the film, I delved in having only read the very 50/50 comments here on Amazon. A lot of people seem to want to compare this film to Bridesmaids, and I'm not sure why. Granted, one of the lead actresses from Bridesmaids is a lead actress in this film as well- but why should that mean this film is going to be anything similar to Bridesmaids? It's not, and I- for one- was thrilled that it took a refreshing right turn from Bridesmaids.

This film follows Imogene (Kristen's character) on her humbling fall from fame (or 'almost fame') as a playwright. Amidst losing everything, she finds the important things. The story is fairly predictable, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth a watch. It's beautifully constructed, full of entertaining and loveable characters, and thoroughly dabbled with witty humor.

Contrary to many people, I didn't find Bridesmaids terribly gut-wrenchingly funny. I found it mediocre. Not one of my favorite films. But this film, to an extreme contrast- I found intelligently humorous. The entire film was filled with subtle and quirky jokes that everyone could relate to. I found myself giggling throughout the entire movie. The sweet dialogue passed between Imogene and her family is both relatable and utterly spirited. I found myself relating to her more and more as the film went on.

The film does have a few surprising twists and turns. When all put together it creates an unrealistic but very entertaining storyline that kept me head-over-heels in love with the movie. I loved every last minute of it and found myself rooting for each of the characters. The film does an amazing job of taking even the most serious of moments and filling them with sarcastic humor that makes the film enjoyable (even for cry-baby women like myself who can find a reason to tear up during virtually any movie). This film, although having its typical ups and downs keeps a relatively light mood to it. It's the kind of film I want to watch over and over again.

I really can't begin to explain how much I enjoyed this movie. It's among one of my new favorite movies. It's quirky, light-hearted, fun, sarcastic, and just really really cute. A great mother/daughter date night movie. A great single-cat-lady (like myself) chick-flick. And overall feel-good film that has definitely earned its 5 star rating from me.",1403481600,,2441,4.832535885167464
5831447,3,B00DL47KWI,"I love Kristen Wiig, and I really had some high hopes.  This movie was a little too silly.  The brother and Matt Dillon's characters were a bit too much.",1403395200,,153,4.241379310344827

5831471,5,B00DL47KWI,"I chose this rating because of the constant surprising turns this movie takes, making it deliciously different than one would expect.  The wisdom that comes from the story is profound and subtly presented.  This movie is heartwarming and inspiring, I recommend it highly.",1403395200,,271,5.27906976744186
5831472,5,B00DL47KWI,"I don't know why this movie has such mixed reviews. I'm so glad I decided to watch it because I loved it. It's a movie that's more about the characters than the plot, and I love how human they are. As it gets deeper into the movie, you realize that none of them are all good or all bad, all normal or all eccentric, etc.

There were plenty of laugh out loud moments for me, but it's not the typical box office, inappropriate, big joke type humor. As other reviewers have said, it's more subtle. It kind of builds up throughout the film rather than being joke #1, joke #2, joke #3... It's the kind that makes you laugh at the sheer terribleness of the situation. It's a little offbeat. And if that's your sense of humor, I think you'll like the movie.",1403395200,,750,4.244755244755245

They also teach us how to be comfortable in our own skin with our own less than perfect family members.  Obviously, they are the long lost cousins to the 'Little Miss Sunshine' cast.

The production and direction are very sound and the ensemble acting is solid with only a couple areas where the activities and dialogue take on a feeling of sandpaper instead of seamlessly flowing.

The story writing is somewhat pro forma in that we have seen many coming-of-age/maturation movies of dedicated, young, working women (""Working Girl"" and ""Broadcast News"" are my favorites of this genre), but in the end this film does not carry as much ""chops"" as those have. I fear that Wiig is heading toward a typecasting place (ala 2011 ""BridesMaids""), that she may regret in the future (sort of like McCartny).

5831553,4,B00DL47KWI,"Someone (I forget who) said, while writing a script, always do something the audience doesn't expect. Michelle Morgan seems to have taken that advice while writing the script for this movie.

Here's the scoop. Imogene Duncan (Kristen Wiig) Attempts suicide after her boyfriend leaves her and she loses her job. She's forced to move into her mother's house where she is confronted with an odd assortment of characters and a personal odyssey ensues.

I like Kristen Wiig. I like the work she did on SNL and her attempts in film, to break away from her TV persona have, for my dollar, been successful. She doesn't disappoint here. I like the character she's built. She's someone who squandered her potential as a play write and needs to fight her way back while exorcizing her demons. She really is oblivious to how others view her. She's a stick in the mud and doesn't know how to pick her fights. The odd folk around her, including her cloistered brother, help her to see the world a different way. This is a fun ride.

As I mentioned, there are a lot of surprises in the script. It rarely rode the path I expected and that kept me in the game. The supporting roles from Annette Bening, Matt Dillon et al were all good. It's not a flashy film but it can't be. The directing, editing, music, etc. are all on par with the content.

It's not overly funny, not overly romantic, in fact it's probably just too real.  It made me uncomfortable, likely because I know too many people whose lives are so nearly like Imogene's.  Not in exact detail but in overall affect.  And I just want them all to make it through the tough times, with their families, like Imogene does.
This takes a long time to bring you back up from the doldrums, but it does and you'll very likely be smiling and feeling much better.  I know I did.  Thanks for a nice movie to watch on a rainy day.  (really, it was raining)",1402704000,,716,4.1678832116788325
5831555,4,B00DL47KWI,"'Girl Most Likely' is a quirky film that will probably see more hits on DVD than in the theatre. I was surprised how much I enjoyed the film. Kristin Wigg plays Imogene, a young woman who received an award as one of the best potential playwrights, and now has lost the buzz. She has a handsome boyfriend who does not seem as interested in her as she is in him. She has found the society life, but does not seem to be a good fit.

When one thing leads to another, she finds herself back in Ocean City, NJ, in the home of her mother, whom she has not seen for years. Zelda, mom, is wonderfully played by Annette Bening. Hers is probably the best acted part of the film. A kooky lady who likes to gamble. She lives with an alleged CIA agent named George Bousche, played by Matt Dillon. Imogene finds her old room has been rented out to a young man, Lee, played by Darren Criss. Her brother, Ralph, played by Christopher Fitzgerald, is a nice young man with some sort of disability. Trying to find her bearings, Imogene needs to decide what she really wants in life. Can she revive her career? Can she live with her family in the homemade sheet bed in the living room? Some laughs, some great acting by Annette Bening and the film does try to stay on track. Not sure what the goal was, but an enjoyable film.

5831619,3,B00DL47KWI,"There may be spoilers.

Kristen Wiig is one of those actors I'll watch in any movie without doing much research.  That includes this middling comedy, romance, drama. Wiig plays a dysfunctional and unpopular failed writer living in New York City.  Once on the fast track with a new play that failed, she's now in a deep funk, buoyed only by her boyfriend (Brian Petsos) who is about to dump her.  In an effort to lure him back, Imogene (Wiig) fakes a suicide attempt which lands her in the psych-ward.  The hospital, being full, sends her home with her mother (Annette Bening) back to Ocean City, N.J.

Not having been back for years, Imogene is surprised that Zelda (Bening) is sharing a bed with some sort of secret agent (Matt Dillon).  Her old bedroom is being rented out to Lee (Darren Criss), who sings in a Backstreet Boys cover band.  Brother Ralph (Christopher Fitzgerald) completes the household.  Imogene tries to get her mojo back, and finds a little romance with the younger Lee.  He helps her get back to the city to attend a book release party of a supposed friend.  A new wrinkle in the plot comes in the form of Imogene and Ralph's father (Bob Balaban), who was believed to be dead.  At least that's what mom told the siblings when they were very young.  Finding out about this lie, leads to an unfortunate reunion.

While this film isn't terrible, it wastes the talent of Wiig and Bening.  The story, while perhaps interesting, is convoluted to a fault.  The romance between Imogene and Lee doesn't feel right.  The comedy is limited to Imogene's reactions and expressions and Zelda's weirdness.  But they are both pretty normal compared to the crackpot inventor, Ralph.  In the end, it's hard to feel much sympathy for any of the characters.  The film is at its best when Bening and Wiig are on the screen at the same time.  This is a modestly, watchable film.  Just don't expect ""Bridesmaids.""

The Blu ray transfer comes in a 1080p resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  While the picture isn't eye-popping, it is certainly well done.  Images are sharp and well defined.  The audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  This is a dialog heavy film so there's little to expect in surrounds other than street noise and other ambient sounds.  Dynamic range is limited, but there is really nothing particularly bad.  Dialog is clear and that's what counts.  Extras are limited to a gag reel, a short piece on Ralph's ""invention,"" a making of short and some deleted scenes.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.",1396915200,,2538,4.7

5831630,2,B00DL47KWI,The script was amazing. But Kristin Wiig was miscast. I really wanted to love this film as I grew up on that boardwalk (and under it) in the summers of my youth. Just couldn't believe her in the role.,1393200000,,200,4.153846153846154

5831632,4,B00DL47KWI,"Thirtysomething modern-day New York lady Imogene Duncan (Kristen Wiig) has the lot - a well-to-do boyfriend who once stated they were Soul Mates (he'd say it again if only if he could stay off his mobile long enough to remember), an apartment in the right address with a unformed doorman (none of your riff raff here), society friends who wear Jimmy Choos and sip cocktails (their spitefulness makes the real housewives of Beverley Hills look positively saintly) and even a possible writing career outside of the magazine she works for (if she could only get that Play she was supposed to write 8 years back down on paper). What could possibly go wrong? Well, try everything...

And then the diced carrots really hit the fan when brash Zelda her bed-hopping gambling-addicted mother shows up from New Jersey in a stolen car...on loan from her new boyfriend who calls himself George Bousche and claims to be an undercover CIA agent with possible Samurai consciousness tie-ins (hilarious turns by Annette Bening and Matt Dillon). Imogene rapidly loses her boyfriend, her job, her apartment and her fair-weather socialite pals - eventually ending up back in Ocean City in rental Hell in her ""Friends"" teeshirt instead of snazzy clothes.

Only now her old room has been let out by gambler Mom to a complete stranger who doesn't change the sheets that often (a handsome turn by Darren Criss) and Imogene has also to live and deal with Ralph - her almost mentally challenged younger brother who won't go any further than the boardwalk and whose fixated on crabs and the invention of a human shield like the outer crusts of molluscs (a part that could so easily have been awful superlatively played by Christopher Fitzgerald). Then it gets worse. Only now does Imogene learn that Mum's hopeless parenting might even extend to lies about her supposedly dead father. Maybe he's a genius author right now - very much alive and well and living like a millionaire in a plush townhouse back in the New York area she just lost...

Co-Directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini and written by Michelle Morgan from her own experiences - ""Girl Most Likely"" as you can imagine is a bit all over the place story-wise - but it's undeniably witty and at times very touching - a hard combo to get right. And it has superb roles for women - hitting a lot of those mid-life crisis points along its convoluted but merry way. A lot of the fun credit has to go the two superlative women leads  - Kristen Wiig and Annette Bening whose scenes together are electric - Bening getting the look, the swagger and the god-awful garish clothes of Zelda absolutely spot on. But they're not to be outdone by the men in what was obviously a 'nice' movie to work on - good material made by good people.

The BLU RAY picture quality is beautiful throughout and stretched to the full screen. But don't watch the 'making of' extra first - it rather stupidly gives away too many key scenes - especially those featured towards the end of the movie.

Not a masterpiece by any stretch of the cinematic imagination - but this little film has heart and laughs and is a lot better than most. Luckily you won't get crabs off ""Girl Most Likely"" - but you'll be glad after you watched it that you addled up to it's plentiful charms in the first place...",1392854400,,3310,4.668953687821612

He probably had no idea how to start being a father to her, especially jumping in at this late stage in her life.  Plus, from what she was telling him about her life, it was natural for him to assume that she needed money which he offered.

This movie is also about a woman who's life is not panning out as she had hoped or planned but has some very realistic scenes about how she copes (or doesn't) with that, and also some very good performances by Annette Bening (as the somewhat eccentric mother) and Matt Dillon (as the Mom's seemingly whacky boyfriend).

5831752,5,B00DL47KWI,"On the surface this is your typical quirky comedy about a dysfunctional family combined with a chick flick. The film opens with a young Imogene (Sydney Lucas) wanting to change the most famous line from ""The Wizard of Oz."" After all who would want to go to Kansas once you have been in Oz. The film smartly copies the theme and to some extent, the characters of the famous film.

Imogene (Kristen Wiig/Dorothy) is forced to go back home from NYC (Oz) to her family home in Ocean City, N.J. Her mother (Annette Bening/ Glenda) is over the top and lives with a younger man, George the Boushe (Matt Dillon/ Cowardly Lion) who claims he is CIA and has been a Samurai for 25 years, but seems more like a con artist. Her seeming half-wit brother Ralph (Christopher Fitzgerald/ Scarecrow) likes crabs and creates an infinite stream of metaphors about homes and protection. Imogene has discovered her room has been rented out to Lee (Darren Criss/ Tin Man) a man who is deeper than what is seen on the surface.

Imogene's goal is to return to Oz and find the Wizard (Bob Balaban).

This is not a great comedy by any means. It is just a simple heart warming story and chick flick that was smartly written by Michelle Morgan.  I loved it, even if no one else did. Good Date night film.

""Girl Most Likely"" wants to present the viewer with a woman who is a completely self-absorbed, un-self-aware mess, and have the audience rooting for her -- and that's just not possible.

For a little background, Imogene grew up in the Atlantic City, NJ area with an eccentric mother (played very enjoyably be Annette Bening) and a brother who's a little odd and needy (also a very good performance).  Imogene flees her family for NYC, where she doesn't experience the meteroic rise as a playwright she'd hoped for, but still, she clings to the idea of being part of the sophisticated city milieu.  Unfortunately, her suave, live-in boyfriend breaks up with her, she loses her job -- and she ends up in a psych ward.  Imogene is then put in the care of her estranged mother and finds herself back in Jersey, a place for which she has a chronic contempt.  Imogene's mother has taken in a boarder (another strong performance as given by Darren Criss of ""Glee""), who becomes a reluctant companion to Imogene as she struggles to reestablish herself in NYC.

There are some laughs in the film, but Wiig is really only given caustic humor to work with; almost everything out of her mouth is negative and mean.  Imogene's loving relationship with her brother, Ralph, is designed to show her softer side, I think -- but it only serves to make the character less believable as there are no traces of that heart of gold anywhere else in her life.  The character is completely devoid of empathy.  Along those lines, it is not believable that Imogene has any talent as a writer.  She has no clue her boyfriend and friends don't really care for her, has no insight into what is going on with her famiy; she pays attention to absolutely nothing.  Yet she's a gifted playwright?  (In ""Young Adult"" the main character writes books for teenage girls, underscoring that she has no depth, not contradicting it.)

In order for a character to be redeemed, it has to be believable that she's redeemable, and while watching this movie I never bought that Imogene was someone who was just a little lost.  She has major issues and flaws.  In contrast, despite their problems, her mother and brother are pretty fleshed out, likable characters.  While this is kind of the point, Imogene needed a little more of what they got.  Matt Dillon, who I always love seeing onscreen, has a turn as the mother's wacky boyfriend.  While the character is meant as a foil for Imogene, his part of the storyline takes the movie to a really ridiculous place, and it stays there.  There's also a subplot involving the supposed death of Imogene and Ralph's father that works at first, but eventually becomes silly in a bad way.

So why 3 stars?  Because I enjoyed Annette Bening that much.  And Christopher Fitzgerald gives a really sweet performance as Ralph.  There are moments where the writing is strong and the family dynamics are portrayed very well.  But overall, I never even wanted to like Imogene.

(As an aside, there's a major faux paus in the movie when Darren Criss's character is pumping his own gas in NJ -- it's illegal to do so.)",1384646400,,3494,4.67430441898527

5831778,2,B00DL47KWI,"First of all, let me start by saying that I am a fan of all of the actors in this film. I typically love Kristen Wiig's movies, Annette Bening is amazing, I love Darren Criss in Glee, and I haven't disliked a single Matt Dillon film that I've seen. With so much star power, I didn't expect this movie to be so awful. Even having been broken up with, nearly committed to a mental institution, and doomed to live with an eccentric mother, I still couldn't muster up the slightest bit of sympathy for Imogene (Kristen Wiig). Bening and Dillion's characters were just TOO out there--more caricature than actual substance. The only likable person in this movie was Darren Criss, and he seemed so incredibly out of place. This was just a mess, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. The only reason I didn't turn it in the first 20 minutes was because I paid to see it.",1384473600,,863,4.366459627329193

The doctors want her to go home to a place where she can be loved and cared for, her mother (Benning). This change does not go as smooth as the doctor expected. While trying to adjust to this drastic change in her life she learns of a family secret that changes everything. There is a saying ""you can't judge a book by it's cover"", I am coming up with a new saying ""you can't judge a movie by it's cast"". I was looking forward to this because of Kristin Wiig. There have been many recent movies where actors that are mostly in main stream comedies do more art house type comedy. Tina Fey in Admission, Paul Rudd in Prince Avalanche and now this one with Kristin Wiig. While this is a comedy at its core it does have many dramatic aspects and isn't the type of movie you would expect from Wiig. Not that this isn't good, it just wasn't really what I expected. If you are into laugh-out-loud comedies this isn't one of them. If you are into more off beat movies with a few laughs then this is one for you. Overall, funny but just not what I expected.

5831840,2,B00DL47KWI,"A dud, despite superior cast.  The movie does not know if it is serious or a spoof and misses the mark on both. If you liked ""Bridesmaids"", this is nowhere near as wickedly ironic.
If you fancy a comedy about a self-deluding woman who crashes into reality, see ""Young Adult"", with Charlize Theron.  It's bitter and hilarious.

The story lines are similar: superficial woman hates her upbringing, thinks she will take the big city by storm, gets dumped by rich boyfriend, landlord,  and snooty faux-friends, and goes home to face the music .
""Young Adult"" focuses on selfish Theron's developing some humanity: ""Girl Most"" focuses on hangdog Wiig needing prozac because she can't stay in NYC with all the beautiful people even though she has no talent and is boring everyone to death.
There are the ubiquitous ""partying drunk"" scenes.
""Girl"" plays as an over-long spoof with all the exceptional cast forced to play goofy stereotypes that would have been okay in a 5 minute, SNL skit . I have to blame the script on this one.  The attempt at a romantic storyline between Wiig and Criss flops.  He clearly has acting talent and screen appeal and tries to sell it but there is no chemistry at all in their grope scene.  Also, he is the only actor who is playing his role seriously.  Benning is waaaaay too beautiful to be Wiig's mother, but she adds the only comic relief against Wiig's bloodhound-droopy face.  We've seen Matt Dillon do his crazy/looney role before and it is getting boring here as Bening's boyfriend.  Bob Balaban is his usual hermetically-sealed robot-self as her long-lost, successful-writer father who feels absolutely no interest in the two kids he sired in his youth. Then, she saves her family from an assassin who is stalking Dillon,  by jumping him while wearing her mollusk-obsessed brother's invention, a people-sized protective shell.  Ugh.
Somehow this brings Wiig a catharsis that she propels into a successful return to the Big Apple, a fancy apartment and a critically acclaimed play.
