8031227,3,B0002S64BO,"This movie was a bit boring, and the acting wasn't the best.  I have it away after I watched it.",1501804800,,96,3.8
8031228,4,B0002S64BO,"An excellent film, suspenseful & well acted.
It's based on a true story and really holds your interest, especially if you like court trials.  I couldn't stop watching it.
It shows the value of a close friendship and how one woman goes all out to support the other.
A movie well worth seeing.  I'd rate it at 4 1/2 stars.",1429660800,,320,4.316666666666666
8031229,5,B0002S64BO,"DVD arrived in Excellent Condition, Perfect, Like New. THANKS. I was friends with Sunny & Jesse. He was at my home the night of the killings, before picking up Sunny, so she didnit know this. I gave Jesse $50.00 for a Motel Room. If Rhodes hadn,t pushed them to leave that night things might have been different. But Hindsight is Perfect. Jesse was INNOCENT, I know this for a fact & can prove it. I would have liked to see more about him and his life, but it was Sunnys' story and a good one. JUSTICE was not DONE. That was the real Problem.",1427500800,,542,4.221153846153846
8031230,4,B0002S64BO,"Moving (and true) story of the efforts to free an innocent woman and reverse a travesty of justice. The cast is a mix of either names that were household names when the movie was made, or were up-and-coming actors who are household names now.",1374105600,,242,4.5227272727272725
8031231,3,B0002S64BO,"This movie is based on a TRUE event about a woman and her husband/lover who find themselves entangled in the corrupt legal system, landing both on DEATH ROW, after they agree to accept a ride back to their home-state from the husband/lover's EX-CON ""friend.""

""In the Blink of an Eye,"" 2 officers end-up ""shot to death"" and the ""victims"" (the woman & husband/lover), end up with GUILTY verdicts, instead of the ""supposedly"" EX-CON driver.

15 years later, the imprisoned woman's childhood best friend reunites with her friend and is compelled to FIGHT THE SYSTEM and OVERTURN the verdict during the course of her LAST CHANCE APPEAL.  Her friend conducts her OWN investigation in collaboration with her friend's lawyers.

It is a FAST-PACED movie.  The acting is not the best at all - although the storyline would have had GREATER potential.  (I will RESERVE my personal opinion/thoughts about the characters - esp. the ""victims"" from this review, as I cannot decipher if it's due to the ""bad acting"" or ""sloppy"" script).

However, this movie reveals the ""corrupt legal system,"" the ""lies"" and ""twists"" that actually occur in courtrooms, along with the legal ""deals"" that are cut-out for ""alleged witnesses"" that send the innocent to prison and reduce sentences for the guilty and/or fake ""witnesses.""

This movie emphasizes more on ""THE LEGAL SYSTEM"" and NOT ""PRISON LIFE."" So, you do NOT see ""WOMEN IN PRISON LIFE"" (raping, cussing, fighting, stabbing women, lunch-stealing women, etc).  On the contrary, because the focus is NOT in ""PRISON LIFE,"" this movie does not give you the slightest-chance to see PRISON as a ""BAD place.""

As mentioned before, it IS a very fast-paced movie.  So, you're not eternally ""grounded"" in a courtroom OR ""grounded"" in prison.  It moves rather quickly. It's NOT suspenseful or gripping, but just a historical story of a TRUE event.

I would have given this movie 2 stars because of the bad acting and a sloppy script (in my opinion) but the story-line's undeveloped GREATER potential is why I gave it a 3-star rating.",1301097600,,2051,4.979472140762463
