First and foremost for the fact it had no songs, secondly for the theme of the film, thirdly for portraying a leading character in the film as a negative one, fourthly it was a film totally different from what normally Rajesh Khanna or Yash Chopra used to do. Rajesh Khanna puts in an excellent acting performance in the role of a man accused of murdering his wife and on the run from the law for it. Yash Chopra (director) handles the film brilliantly and the viewer is kept on the edge and guessing right thru to the end. A must see for all lovers of Good Indian Cinema. (Hmmm Good Indian Cinema sound like a misnomer in today's Bollywood)",1301875200,,736,4.45925925925926
