6104472,4,B00GRTVTQ2,When will the Region 1 version of One Chance be released?  I already watched the movie when Yahoo previewed it last year and I read at that time that it would be released in the US in January or February. I keep checking with Amazon and still only see the Region 2 version which isn't compatible with our US DVD and Blu-ray players. I enjoyed the movie especially James Corden's performance and am looking forward to seeing it again.,1421884800,36,433,4.481012658227848

6104474,3,B00GRTVTQ2,"It's impossible to watch uplifting underdog story One Chance and not think of Billy Elliot. The plucky hero in this case isn't a ballet dancing boy, but rather the real life Paul Potts, the cell phone salesman turned Pavarotti-esque opera singer who won Britain's Got Talent and became an instant sensation. The film is endearing and tough to dislike as so many of these Brit crowd-pleasers tend to be, but it's constructed in such a by-the-numbers fashion that it makes Potts' story seem like a work of fiction.

Comic James Corden, who only resembles Potts in terms of size, does a surprisingly good job as the South Wales chap who overcame bullying, a less-than-supportive father (Colm Meaney), and a severe lack of confidence to embrace his love of opera, despite being bullied mercilessly for it. The film breezes much too quickly through pretty much every aspect of his life, as if producer Simon Cowell had designed it to be a fill-in episode of one of his many talent-based shows. Potts works in the Carphone Warehouse alongside his RPG-loving best friend Bradden (Mackenzie Crook), but despite his rapturous voice that everyone loves, his lack of self-confidence prevents him taking it any further. He finds that extra boost in Julie-Ann (the lovely and genuine Alexandra Roach), the online girlfriend he'd been too scared to meet in the flesh. Nicknaming one another 'Brad Pitt' and 'Cameron Diaz', their relationship becomes a guide post for Potts, even as his journey takes him to Venice and a performance in front of his idol, Luciano Pavarotti.

The film takes full advantage of every opportunity to tug at your heartstrings and feel for Potts, who it seems can't stay out of the hospital bed for any manner of physical ailment. Dressing like a sad clown to perform Pagliacci in front of a rowdy hometown crowd, Potts floors them with his unlikely voice; an early achievement that helped set him on his path. But every time he's about to take the next step something awful occurs, like a terminal bout of stage fright, or a burst appendix before a major show, or getting hit by a car. These are only given enough emotional weight to earn our sympathy and pity, but even if you've never heard of Potts (as I hadn't) how this story turns out won't come as a surprise.

Directed with workmanlike efficiency by David Frankel, who will perhaps always be known as the guy who helmed The Devil Wears Prada, the film finds a winning formula in the combination of Corden and Roach. The Tony award-winning actor acquits himself well as Potts, lip-syncing to his powerful voice and capturing his warm-hearted spirit. Some may recognize Roach as the teenaged Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady, and she shows a different sort of strength and sturdiness here. In a film that doesn't stretch much beyond formula, their relationship is one that we want to get that storybook happy ending.",1412985600,2,2887,4.851926977687627
6104475,5,B00GRTVTQ2,"One Chance is a drama genre film based on British tenor Paul Potts. The narrative examines from childhood his interest in music, difficulties during adolescence, attempts to establish a professional opera career, his family, and love life.

The film does take some liberties with Potts actual personal circumstances, but nevertheless the story follows a determined singer hoping to gain a break.

Potts setbacks and at times continuous run of bad luck presents a person at the edge of abandoning his dream, yet he persists through dark times, and finds a suitable place for his talent to be appreciated on Britains Got Talent.

The movie regularly offers enjoyable scenes, with a cast of great personalities, and an inspiring story to smile about.

6104476,4,B00GRTVTQ2,"One Chance is a biographical picture of Paul Potts, a mobile phone salesman turned opera singer. James Corden plays Paul Potts (with the singing voice dubbed by Potts himself), who, despite his disapproving father (Colm Meaney) and lack of confidence, became a singing sensation overnight after appearing on Britain's Got Talent in 2007.

As a bio-pic One Chance feels all too familiar (penned by The Bucket List writer Justin Zackham), and though the on-location photography is beautiful to see, the Italians section (really shot in Venice) is not very convincing.

Directed by David Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada), the film best works when following the romance of Paul and Julie-Ann, a charming girl Paul meets in an internet chat room. Alexandra Roach (who played young Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady) as lovely Julie-Ann is very impressive. Julie Walters as Potts' encouraging mother, and Mackenzie Crook as his friend and terribly inefficient manager are also very good.

One Chance may be a little formulaic as a true life story, but is still entertaining and worth watching.",1397606400,9,1087,5.1647727272727275
