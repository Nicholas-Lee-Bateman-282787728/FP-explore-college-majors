I do not believe these cartoons give children's entertainment a bad name. Rather, they call into question the very definition of ""entertainment"" if the term can be so loosely applied. They are, I would say, something more akin to ""child abuse"" than ""children's entertainment."" How any child could watch these cartoons--and we know they watch them over and over--without his/her brain resolving into a viscous gray sludge is beyond me.

These cartoons were quickly excreted to take advantage of Disney's far-superior offerings, Hercules and Pocahontas. Their perceived market was confused parents who, seeing what they thought was a bargain or perhaps a pricing error by a careless clerk, would pick this DVD up by mistake. Really. And what a mistake it would be!

Of course, as one of the writers, I am prejudiced. What parent finds their own children anything but beautiful? Well, in this case, even I have to admit that what we have here are two babies of such hideous aspect that, if they were abandoned, orphanages would leave them on the doorsteps of other orphanages. Gypsies would recoil in horror. Wolves would refuse to devour them.

They are, in fact, a vile abomination upon the face of the earth.

If you buy them by accident, remember that Amazon has a generous return policy.",1348444800,11,1523,5.003952569169961
