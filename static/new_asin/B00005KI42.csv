7943462,4,B00005KI42,"This video seems short (40 min) (but most of the other tapes in the series go for longer), but it is packed with excellent dance routines.  As far as instructional videos goes I would consider this one fair to average.  It start of with the basics of leading and following, but quickly leads into more advanced patterns that might be a bit much for a beginning dancer.  Marcus and Barbl are excellent dances and provide the tape with some interesting moves that I haven't seen on other instructional videos.  The move list is: triple-lindy basic, the send out, the pass through, the whip, the whip with a free spin, the quick stop, switches, the rhythm turn, dean kicks, the sugar push, the sling shot, and the slide.  I would recommend that you try another video of you are a beginner (perhaps Big City Swing). but once you get the basics down this video is amazing.  As a bonus this video is full of live footage from swing dance competitions.  As a swing dance teacher, I love this one.",1035763200,5,989,4.522471910112359
