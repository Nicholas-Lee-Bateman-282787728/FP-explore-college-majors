8119765,3,B000FA7BJI,"I was a little bummed. I think it was due to my own expectations. Or maybe not, Maybe I really was hoping for more.
I preferred the Paul Grilley DVD's over this one by a long shot. I only used it once and passed it on.
The Paul Grilley DVD's I use regularly.
So if really wanting more for the buck, do some research and make sure you are buying something you will use, not just watch once and pass along.
This DVD workout does give some good info and asana's.
For me, I simply wanted more.",1433721600,3,489,4.051546391752577
