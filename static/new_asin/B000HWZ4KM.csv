2646362,4,B000HWZ4KM,"Yes, from all I've seen it was a pretty wonderful life, for most Americans, from 1945 to 55 when we ruled the world.  Both of these movies capture some of that unquestioning nationalistic sentimentality and  disingenuouness  that would finally  evaporate completely in the jungles of Viet Nam.  For now though we had a ton of food and tent space and it was worth a try since nothing we did ended badly, yet.

  Jimmy Stewart is perfectly cast as the George Bailey,kindhearted but bitterly disappointed by life so far. With techniques that borrow heavily  from AA and Charles Dickens he is finally convinced that his life has been is a force for good.  The sentiments are soggy but the movie has an almost noirish realism especially in the nightmare of what his quaint small-town turns into without him.

  This movie ends with a rousing ""Hark the Herald Angels Sing"" and ""White Xmas' ends with a rousing, (What else?"")""White Xmas"" as the long-awaited snow falls behind them. There is no pretense of realism in this movie, and much of the enjoyment here is just the tremendous camp fun especially with Dany Kaye devouring the set in every other shot.",1178409600,2,1149,4.771573604060913
2646363,2,B000HWZ4KM,"The movies were great and what I wanted, with one exception... In the description it states that they are in color, where in fact ""White Christmas"" is in color but ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is not. That is the only gripe that I have about this duo-set. I have been trying for several months to get a copy of the colorized version of ""It's A Wonderful Life"". I saw this advertized as color and ordered it. I received it and watched the movie, only to find out that it is not in color, but in fact black & white. I am very disappointed of this fact.",1174608000,5,545,4.150943396226415
2646364,5,B000HWZ4KM,"A Christmas classic.  All these years later, life can still be the same as in this movie.  Lot's of us are always striving, longing for a ""better"" more exciting life and many times if we stepped back and looked at ours it couldn't get any better, we just need to appreciate what we have and make the best of our life.",1170374400,,317,4.180327868852459
2646365,5,B000HWZ4KM,"I had a chance to watch both movies over the Holiday, and was very pleased with both of them.",1169078400,,93,3.9473684210526314
2646366,5,B000HWZ4KM,Anyone who loves these classic movies will love these DVDs. These movies are more and more rarely seen in their entirety on TV - this is a wonderful opportunity to see them in their entirety. A great value!,1168732800,,206,4.447368421052632
2646367,5,B000HWZ4KM,"This is a wonderful collection of two class Christmas films...Jimmy Stewart provides a poignant reminder of the beauty of our lives, the importance of family, and overall contentment in ""It's A Wonderful Life;"" Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and friends entertain in the WWII setting in White Christmas, with his timeless rendition of that song and others.  A great addition of clean, classic entertainment for any household.",1168473600,2,418,5.333333333333333
2646368,5,B000HWZ4KM,"You will never find prices like this, I received two movies for the price of one! In the stores, alone, It's a Wonderful Life is $20.00. As always, I received my DVD's on time and was able to track my order which I like.",1168300800,2,220,4.0227272727272725
2646369,3,B000HWZ4KM,I always look for widescreen films and this is one of those.  I like to see the entire screen the way it was filmed rather than part of the action cut off in strange places.,1167177600,6,173,3.942857142857143
2646370,5,B000HWZ4KM,The other reviewer is living in the past- widescreen is the way to go. Widescreen is not bad- its actually showing the movies as they originally came out in theaters. The movies are great.,1167004800,5,188,4.5588235294117645

2646421,1,B000HWZ4KM,"At several points in the movie, It's A Wonderful Life played like the DVD had been scratched. Movie even froze at one point and we had to go to the DVD menu and restart.  The disc appears fine, so I assume it is the quality of the item. Disappointing.",1450915200,,251,4.122448979591836
2646422,5,B000HWZ4KM,"As most everyone (middle-aged and beyond adults, anyways, and countless others) is already well aware, these two films - ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946, 130 mins., b&w) and ""White Christmas"" (1954, 120 mins., colour) - are terrific holiday classics. In the DVD releases of this wonderful 2 discs set, picture and audio quality is excellent on each - crisp, clean, clear, and beautiful. This delightful ""Classic Christmas Collection"" set is a must-have for any collector of not only great holiday movies, but also of first-rate vintage films and entertainment. Get this collection and enjoy year after year!

NOTE: This review is of the 2-discs ""Classic Christmas Collection"" set. I see that the vast majority (99.9%) of reviews appearing here are for just ""White Christmas"", as, clearly, reviews of it, and of this 2-discs Christmas set, are all dumping together. Realize that my review is expressly regarding the set bearing the cover title I've mentioned (which is precisely where I'm posting this - though I realize this will likely also wind up appearing elsewhere), and for which the advertised cover artwork shows an image from ""Wonderful"", followed by that movie's full title, in the upper portion, the ""Classic Christmas Collection"" words in white and yellow print throughout the cover's green midsection, and an image from ""White"", followed by the movie's complete title, on the cover's lower portion. I'm pointing all this out so that if you're considering purchasing the same excellent set as I now own, you'll be able to actually find a review about it. Incidentally, the ""It's a Wonderful Life"" included DVD is the 2006 60th anniversary edition, and the ""White Christmas"" included DVD is the 2000 edition. Both films are presented in gorgeous condition.",1450828800,2,1765,5.171328671328672

You get a DVD copy of one of the best Christmas movies of all time, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, and a copy of one of the best Christmas ""musicals"" of all time, WHITE CHRISTMAS. IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is worth owning just because of the huge influence it has had upon pop culture. WHITE CHRISTMAS has been influential, too, but what makes the movie stand out are the heavenly voices and picture perfect scenes.

2646479,5,B000HWZ4KM,"IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a classic film without a doubt. When you are down and out put this film in and really see what it has to say. When your back is against the wall and it seems hopeless there is still a ray of hope. Someone somewhere does care. You have made a difference throughout your life and you don't realize it. You made a difference to the ones you loved and loved you. You made a difference no matter how insignificant to many you have made contact with. Perhaps is worth living after all. You may have more to offer than you ever knew. You will be missed. You never know what's around the bend of life. Stewart conveys the torment and despair of hopelessness brilliantly. Yet, he perseveres. My heart goes out to him in this film. He just seems so sincere. Mister Capra, there is no corn here, just heart. Thank you so much for this film. WHITE CHRISTMAS is a beautiful and colorful holiday film full of song and dance. It is very entertaining and the Christmas spirit permeates every frame of this film. Dean Jagger's subtle performance truly steals this ultimately hart warming film.",1379030400,,1101,4.482587064676617

I received 2 emails of the status and received the video just a few days later. A follow-up email was also sent once the video was delivered to assure my satisfaction.

2646525,2,B000HWZ4KM,"I love both these movies and wanted to own them, and this set was priced cheap enough.  But the ""It's a Wonderful Life"" disc was faulty and would only play about a third of the way through before freezing.  After trying it on another dvd player and finally a brand new one,it still wouldn't play right,so I decided to send the set back and get a refund.  I did not even try ""White Christmas"" as I had to return them as a set anyway.  My money was refunded quickly, so no problem there.  I cannot say that an exchange would have done the same, but I didn't want to have to bother with another return if it did. My guess is they are cheaply made.  I will purchase movies separately in future at my local store.",1327104000,,708,4.169117647058823

2646529,4,B000HWZ4KM,"I can tell you that any place selling this item is going to believe that, Its a wonderful life is in color because the front of box shows both in color,and on the bottom edge of the box it states (1946 & 1954/B&W and color/250 min/not rated) so i firmly belive that the stores that sell this item think the same as the customer.

When I read the description, it reads Black & White, Color - which I took to mean 'respectively' in reference to the titles.  The product name lists It's A Wonderful Life first and White Christmas second, so I expected It's A Wonderful Life to be in black & white (as I've always seen it) and White Christmas to be color (again, as I've always seen it).

2646568,5,B000HWZ4KM,"What's Christmas without snow, snow, SNOW!  Plenty of that to be had in both  Christmas classics: White Christmas and It's a wonderful life!  The family tradition in my house since I was a young girl was the night we decorated the tree, watch White Christmas and have hot chocolate and cinnamon buttered toast.  And who doesn't want to see an angel get it's wings and find ""Zuzu's  petals"" over and over again.  That's not a question.  It's a fact.  Now I'm 55 and my kids are grown and we still cry when the retired General comes in and all his platoon line up to sing ""we'll follow the old man wherever he wants to go!""  I know I will be until I'm 95!",1234224000,,653,4.2439024390243905

It's a Wonderful Life is in glorious black and white in its original 4:3 full screen aspect ratio.  The special features are a documentary ""The Making of 'It's a Wonderful Life',"" a tribute to the film's director Frank Capra from his son called ""A Personal Remembrance,"" and a trailer.

White Christmas is in color in its original widescreen aspect ratio, anamorphic, enhanced for widescreen TVs.  The special features are an interview with star Rosemary Clooney, a commentary track also by Clooney, and two trailers.

These are two true classics, among the most loved Christmas movies, or any movies, of all time.  There are reviews at the links.

Take a break this Christmas from R-rated movies, mind-numbing TV and rap music, pop some popcorn and enjoy!

Oh, and BTW, It's a Wonderful Life is in B&W rather than color as Amazon has listed.  Personally, I think I prefer it in B&W!
