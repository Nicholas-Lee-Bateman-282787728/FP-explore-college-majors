8351063,5,B0025KVNTK,I like the fact that Torchwood is not all bright and shiney. This series has shown that mankinds future is not all Star Trek or all Bladerunner. It show what we may be left to contend with. Children of Earth was amazing. All last week I could not wait to get home to watch each new episode as well as the indepth behind the scenes bonuses. The personal life experiences of the cast mearly allow us to connect with them. My only problem with Children of Earth is that they can cleanly end the series ... I want more!!!,1248912000,4,517,4.232323232323233
8351064,5,B0025KVNTK,I have seen the trailers and this looks like it's going to be fantastic. Can't wait for it to come out. Can't believe that it can get negative reviews before it's even been broadcast. If you didn't like the first series why are you still watching it??,1244764800,3,251,4.361702127659575
8351065,5,B0025KVNTK,"The 3rd season of Torchwood will be a 5-part mini series called ""Children Of Earth"".  I loved Seasons 1 & 2, so it's a given I'll love this.  I'm only upset that we're getting a 5-part mini series instead of a full season, especially since Doctor Who is also not producing a full season this year as well.  BBC America will be showing the 5-part series in late July and tvshowsondvd has announced it will be released on DVD July 28th.  Why does it take Amazon.com so long to put these series up for pre-order after they've already announced a street date?",1244332800,7,555,4.411764705882353
8351066,5,B0025KVNTK,"The one review posted on Torchwood Season 3, says that it was so bad they stopped watching.  I find that interesting because Torchwoood Season 3 will not even be shown on TV until July 09.  How can something be rated bad when it hasn't even been seen yet.  Based on past seasons I am expecting this to rate high.",1243382400,15,312,4.254237288135593
8351067,1,B0025KVNTK,"I loved ""Who"" and have watched both spin-offs; this and Sarah Jane Adventures.

At first Torchwood was original, intriguing with a good group of actors. That would be this Season. But don't let yourself get hooked! Season two takes a horrible turn for the worse.

In season 2 it seams the writers are trying to make sure every character ""bats for both teams"" and everyone sleeps with just about everyone.

I'm not a homo-phobe: there are questions about my dad who still rooms with the same guy he left my mom for. My husband has a cousin everyone wishes would come out. It is part of our world today.

But this show makes it seem like it is natural for everyone to change their minds. Take the butler like guy. In the first season he is pining over his girlfriend that he's hidden in the basement. She's half robot.

Season II:

He and the Captain become lovers.

It was my understanding that either you are or you aren't. You don't just wake up one day and decide to swap teams.

Add to this that the main character, the girl - I'm really bad with names - who is shacking up with her boyfriend. She decides to have a romance with one of the guys in Torchwood. It seems every other episode is about who's doing who.

Season three was so bad my husband and I stopped watching it all together.

If that is what I wanted to see I'd watch Soaps.",1242777600,4,1342,4.3107569721115535
