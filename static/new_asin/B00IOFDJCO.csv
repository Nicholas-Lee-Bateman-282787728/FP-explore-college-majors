6284175,5,B00IOFDJCO,"Well if you didn't like the second Speed but want to own it for the collection this is for you. Its a two disc box set, its just one case but the cover art is awesome.

Speed: is the original Blu-ray that came out a while back but the picture and sound quality are excellent. I would give it a 10/10 for content and 10/10 for picture and sound.

Speed 2: is a very well planed Blu-ray the sound a picture quality are great. Part 2 however does fall short on content 7/10, but sound and picture its a 10/10.

So two thumbs up TWENTYTH CENTRY FOX.",1400112000,10,545,4.074766355140187

6284182,5,B00IOFDJCO,"I have seen  both Speed & Speed 2: Cruise Control and I really enjoyed both of them. Matter of fact, I have both of them on DVD. I wanted to get them on Blu-Ray for a two reasons: first I wanted to see the behind the scenes look at both Speed 1 & 2 because the DVDs I own have nothing but the trailers. Second,  I wanted to see what the picture quality would look like on Blu-Ray because I've never own a Blu-Ray before. The good news I have already order it and it came .  my only concerns is I hope I won't have any problems with this in the future.  Speed I give 5 stars and Speed 2: Cruise Control I give 4 stars. Totally recommend getting this bluray two-pack if you are a big fan of speed 1 & 2 !",1456790400,6,702,3.820689655172414

6284187,3,B00IOFDJCO,Speed gets 5 stars & Speed 2 gets 0 stars so that's why I gave it an average of 3. Speed is a great movie. Speed 2 is one of the worst movies I have ever seen & I have seen a lot! It was actually painful to watch. No redeeming qualities.,1438560000,,237,3.576923076923077

6284194,4,B00IOFDJCO,"Speed 1 is always a classic 90's action flick. Bringing Keanu back to the front, and Sandra into a leading role. Both Speed 1 and 2 look great and sound great. This dual pack is the best bang for the buck, basically you get Speed 1 and from time to time you can view speed 2 if you want....",1427068800,,290,3.9322033898305087

8644148,4,B00IOFDJCO,"I watched Speed a million times when it first came out... you know, back on VHS (anyone remember what that is?)!  I don't know why it took me so long to purchase the move on DVD, but was glad to find the set.  I still like Speed and the sequel was pretty good... but either the technology is still old or the quality of the Blu-ray that I got just happened to be bad.  It skipped a lot and froze at one point... luckily recovering a little while later.  I realize people don't like getting reviews on here about whether a movie works or not, but it affects the experience (in my opinion) so I have it in here.  Overall, worth it as long as you can get it to work!  I was entertained all over again watching these movies!  (I also forgot how gross Speed was at times! Haha)",1485648000,2,772,4.1066666666666665
