8182447,5,6302121892,"I am not very fond of opera but Cavalleria Rusticana by Pietro Mascagni is simply fantastic. I have seen this opera performed in Ribeiro Preto, Brazil and I loved it. Then I decided to buy this video, with the opera recorded in Siena, Italy. Shirley Verrett as Santuzza is terrific. One of the best performance I have ever seen in my life. The orchestra is also wonderful. This video is one of my favorite ones and I recommend it.",988243200,4,430,4.455696202531645
