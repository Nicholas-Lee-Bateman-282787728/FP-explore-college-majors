3123689,4,B00147F8WS,"The documentary was sadly upbeat for the subject matter.  The host was constantly smiling and explaining all of the resources which go into any given thing and how many of that particular item the average American uses throughout his/her life.  As if its a good thing to say that we use so-many thousand of disposable toothbrushes in our lifetimes.

Also, there are parts of the documentary that that disgust me.  In order to show you the number of eggs the average American eats, they dump them all from a bulldozer.  This, of course, destroys the usefulness of the eggs...and for an animal rights activist its like watching abortions.

Continuing, I have to say that the number for how many chickens, pigs and cows each American eats in their lifetime has got to be low.  I am currently a 22 year old vegetarian, and I used to eat chicken wings a lot - there's no way I only ate 17 chickens worth of wings, let alone everything else.

Now, on to the good stuff.  I certainly like how this documentary shows us the consumption - it lays items out that either are that item or represent that item.  By the end of the film there are diapers, cans, bread, buns, toothbrushes, hair and skin care products and many more things simply laid out in a fairly open area to show us the massive consumption.  If it were not for this visual, I don't think I would have the respect for this documentary that I do.

3123690,3,B00147F8WS,"This film tracks the life of a boy and girl from childhood through old age.

At various stages of life their consumption of various resources is examined in great detail.

The early displays of actual counts of what they use are at first fascinating and impressive.  Gee...I thought... someone went to lot of effort to assemble and set up over 43,000 soft drink cans.

Then as the statistical bombardment continues, one begins to wonder are these numbers really correct.  Each stat is accompanied with yet another visual display of what the number means.  OK...I get it...I don't need to see the actual number of toothbrushes I will use in a lifetime.

Finally, the whole experience becomes irritating, if there is a point here the film is not making it clear (at least for me).  Even small uses become large values over the 77 years of the average lifespan.

Are we supposed to apologize for being alive?  That was the way I felt a few times.  Apparently you are really not a good person if you eat cheeseburgers.

I would certainly agree that there are waste and excesses that need to be curbed especially here in America, but the film seems to imply that consumers are to blame for all of it.

There is nothing in the film about the endless marketing and advertising that drive all of us to over-buy and over-use.  Consumption and more consumption is just what corporations want and their role in driving that to excess is never explored.

The planned and engineered obsolescence of many products that requires us to re-buy the same items that fill up the landfills is also never considered.

As an hypothetical example, the ""Acme Widget Company"" wants you to buy as many ""widgets"" as possible in your lifetime, building them to last is the very last thing they want to do.  Meanwhile landfills are accumulating thousands of broken and worn out ""widgets"".

There is also nothing about the real source of the human footprint impact and that is over-population.  Even consumption in moderate amounts really starts to add up with 6+ billion of us out there.

Finally, it seems the film misses a golden opportunity to discuss the positive benefits of recycling.  If it was discussed at all I missed it.

Human Footprint is certainly worth a look, but the steady stream of ""average"" statistics may not be entertaining for some.  For me, I felt a sense of relief when the film was over.",1216425600,35,2383,4.716707021791768
3123691,5,B00147F8WS,"The ""Human Footprint"" was first aired on the National Geographic Channel earlier this year.  It is a graphic portrayal of the quantities of stuff that an average American consumes over the course of a lifetime.

The criticism of our lifestyle is implicit.  No one says what all this is doing to the planet, but it quickly becomes obvious that enormous quantities of stuff must be manufactured, consumed, and discarded in order to support the high standard of living that we enjoy. You only have to look at the herd of pigs, tons of potatoes, or football field expanse of bread to be amazed at what we consume.

The story is told with a sense of humor.  The kitchen filling with fruit is funny.  However, the question that comes to mind is whether we will always have the resources to keep this up. The inventory shown by National Geographic is food for thought.

Another interesting video on the subject of the consumer economy is the 20-minute ""The Story of Stuff.""  It does not seem to be available on Amazon, but can be found for viewing on the web. ""Stuff"" is more direct in its point of view.",1210809600,15,1097,4.561224489795919

It was visually impressive to see the amounts of ""stuff"" we go through in a lifetime, and it's a good movie because students have no idea what these amounts really are; they cannot fathom how immense 43,000 soda cans is. However that's really all there was to this dvd-they show a product (or activity), explain (briefly)how it is constructed, or shipped, and then they actually display the amount with the number (literaly they laid out 43,000+ soda cans in a parking lot). There was no explanation of the impact or problems associated with the levels of consumption or waste. And after 30-40 minutes (the dvd is 1.5hrs) it gets well, kind of boring.

3123694,3,B00147F8WS,"Episodes in Human ConsumptionA Teachers Review

Approximately 17 dramatic vignettes are used to impress viewers with how much one American consumes in a year or a lifetime. The strategy is to line up, stack, pile, and otherwise overwhelm the viewer with the quantity of items a person consumes. Since this same theme is driven home again and again, the effectiveness relies on a teacher breaking the video into segments and placing it in context. Unfortunately, there is virtually no recognition given to the concept of renewable resources, which is critical in appraising sustainability, i.e. milk and plant products, etc. are renewable while mined products are non-renewable.  The items discussed move in order from our needs as babies through old age.

1. Diapers are produced at the rate of 3,796 over 2.5 years requiring 1898 pints of crude oil, 715 pounds of plastic, the pulp of 4.5 trees and total 18 billion in use per year. Washing cloth diapers uses water (but again, water cycles which is not emphasized).

2. Usage is converted to massive CO2 production which becomes the coin of the ecological realm.

3. Milk from 65,000 U.S. dairy farms with 9.2 million cows averaging 168 pints per year.

4. Meals require beef, pork, chicken and eggs (one years worth of eggs for a person are
dumped); 19,826 eggs per average lifetime; 20,000 potatoes/person; wheat for pizza and bread, etc.; hot dogs and hamburgers; fruits and veggies; 14,000+ candy bars; 1,056 pounds fo sugar; 5,067 bananas...all per one persons average lifetime. Includes 12,888 oranges, 262 pineapples/person/lifetime as well.
5. 15 tons of plastic packaging per person; 43,371 aluminum soda cans per person per lifetime average.

6. 28,433 showers per person per life [again a water cycle, not a one-way consumption but this is not noted].

7. Cosmetics including toothpaste and deodorant and shampoo require chemical dispersion of 1.2 million gallons/lifetime and 20 gallons of sewer system use per day per person.

8. The human waste stream in America produces 64 tons of glass, plastic, etc. trash per person per lifetime.

9. We consume 68 pounds of clothes per year; laundering the clothes uses water equivalent to 11 days of Niagara Falls.

10. We average 13,248 beers per life, 942 bottles of wine per life, and spend $26,000 for the average wedding.

11. Americans on average move into 10 houses per lifetime; a home consumes 64 trees per home, with allotments of copper, and 7 sets of furniture, appliances, air conditioners, etc.

12. Electrical power consumption in the U.S. is equivalent to burning 20 tons fo coal per person per year, compared to just 6 tons per person world average.

13. Computers are a mixture of waste problems; televisions last an average of 12.5 years.

14. Holiday meals pull out the food limits 6 times a year, 412 per life.

15. Cars with original parts last an average of 12 years; the U.S. uses half the worlds oil at 31,350 gallons of gas per person per lifetime. The cost of air travel is 20 tons of carbon per year.

16. Our impact on the natural world includes the U.S. consuming 1/4 the worlds minerals; loss of land to development, loss of wild habitat.

17. By old age and our consumption of medication per life averages 37,320 pills.

While the data are based on 2008 levels of consumption, there should be little variation from these figures due to hybrid cars, more energy efficient laptops, etc. since population growth will offset any minor gains in efficiency. No discussion is provided of the massive per capita discrepancies between the Western countries consumption and that of India, China, etc. While China has exceeded the American carbon footprint since this video was made, their per capita energy consumption remains 1/4th that of an American and the issue of our luxurious life versus their sparing conservationist living is not broached. This video can have a role in illustrating that disparity.",1448582400,2,3936,4.990825688073395

3123698,4,B00147F8WS,"In this show there is a very tangible view about what is left behind from the consumer and modern lifestyle.  A theme of the film is that throughout the life of a person living in a developed country, there is steady and increasing use of resources, and the coinciding pollution.
If a similar show looked at ranchers and charcoal producers in South America and Africa, you would also see sizeable footprints, but the show would be shorter since their impacts don't involve diverse consumer products.
As some studies show, if all of Asia were to live at U.S. consumption levels we would the equivalent of more than one Earth for resources and waste recycling.  In that respect the human footprint issue for the planet as a whole is derived from the product of a) the average footprint per person, times b) the total human population.  This leads presents new reasons for civilized family planning so the global human population evens out a 9 billion and avoids the new (December 2014) estimate of 12 billion by 2050.",1418515200,,1015,4.755681818181818

It chronicles the lives of a typical boy and girl and follows their lives through the consumption of things needed, used, and consumed to raise them, e.g. diapers, milk, fruits and vegetables, junk food, showers, cosmetics, and so on.  It  presents some startling statistics and then graphically and visually depicts the consumption of the items.  I use this with my high school students  as part of a unit on consumption and conservation.  My students love viewing it.

3123709,4,B00147F8WS,"This documentry is very effective in delivering the desired goal. To show the public, what items an ""average"" human in an average lifetime and how much of it is needed for each human in the United States. This is useful as, I doubt many of us try and estimate how much of these casual items (needed or not) that we go through. Naturally there will be at least one variation from these statistics for everyone, (vegitarian, smaller house, no children) but that is not important.

Seeing all of these items layed out for us, makes this documentry far more effective. 14,000 small milk caurtons cannot be fully visualized unless you see it for yourself (and note the film people used water in the caurtons, they didn't waste anything). The same is true for everything else, even showers, pills and wardrobe items, all of which we need.

Dispite delivering the message it wants to there are a few flaws. Towards the last third, I feel it becomes harder to listen. Also, of course, not EVERY resource we go through is mentioned, but this is about what humans need to stay alive and be able to go in public, not what is needed to preform every job and dispose of the products we waste. The stats only apply to those in the United States, so many could feel affended perhaps. Finally as this was done a few years back, the size of the footprint has probubly increased by now.

In summary, very useful to know and doesn't leave you feeling negative, as many of these documentries do, just aware of what you will do.",1355875200,,1507,4.533088235294118

This movie really puts in perspective how much 'stuff' we actually use, dispose of, and will leave on this plant after we die.  To some, this film may encourage change; personally I wasn't motivated to make much of a change.  The Industrial Revolution brought about ways to make our lives easier and have allowed us to get things done quicker, regardless of the price paid.  There won't be a person who watches this movie and decides to stop driving or stop eating for that matter, but it's certainly food for thought.

I purchased this film three years ago after seeing about it on Natgeo.  The packaging is very creative being made of recycled material.  This is one film that will encourage you to think if nothing else.",1343520000,,872,4.697368421052632

It was visually impressive to see the amounts of ""stuff"" we go through in a lifetime, and it's a good movie because students have no idea what these amounts really are; they cannot fathom how immense 43,000 soda cans is. However that's really all there was to this dvd-they show a product (or activity), explain (briefly)how it is constructed, or shipped, and then they actually display the amount with the number (literaly they laid out 43,000+ soda cans in a parking lot). There was no explanation of the impact or problems associated with the levels of consumption or waste. And after 30-40 minutes (the dvd is 1.5hrs) it gets well, kind of boring.

3358191,3,B00147F8WS,"Episodes in Human ConsumptionA Teachers Review

Approximately 17 dramatic vignettes are used to impress viewers with how much one American consumes in a year or a lifetime. The strategy is to line up, stack, pile, and otherwise overwhelm the viewer with the quantity of items a person consumes. Since this same theme is driven home again and again, the effectiveness relies on a teacher breaking the video into segments and placing it in context. Unfortunately, there is virtually no recognition given to the concept of renewable resources, which is critical in appraising sustainability, i.e. milk and plant products, etc. are renewable while mined products are non-renewable.  The items discussed move in order from our needs as babies through old age.

1. Diapers are produced at the rate of 3,796 over 2.5 years requiring 1898 pints of crude oil, 715 pounds of plastic, the pulp of 4.5 trees and total 18 billion in use per year. Washing cloth diapers uses water (but again, water cycles which is not emphasized).

2. Usage is converted to massive CO2 production which becomes the coin of the ecological realm.

3. Milk from 65,000 U.S. dairy farms with 9.2 million cows averaging 168 pints per year.

4. Meals require beef, pork, chicken and eggs (one years worth of eggs for a person are
dumped); 19,826 eggs per average lifetime; 20,000 potatoes/person; wheat for pizza and bread, etc.; hot dogs and hamburgers; fruits and veggies; 14,000+ candy bars; 1,056 pounds fo sugar; 5,067 bananas...all per one persons average lifetime. Includes 12,888 oranges, 262 pineapples/person/lifetime as well.
5. 15 tons of plastic packaging per person; 43,371 aluminum soda cans per person per lifetime average.

6. 28,433 showers per person per life [again a water cycle, not a one-way consumption but this is not noted].

7. Cosmetics including toothpaste and deodorant and shampoo require chemical dispersion of 1.2 million gallons/lifetime and 20 gallons of sewer system use per day per person.

8. The human waste stream in America produces 64 tons of glass, plastic, etc. trash per person per lifetime.

9. We consume 68 pounds of clothes per year; laundering the clothes uses water equivalent to 11 days of Niagara Falls.

10. We average 13,248 beers per life, 942 bottles of wine per life, and spend $26,000 for the average wedding.

11. Americans on average move into 10 houses per lifetime; a home consumes 64 trees per home, with allotments of copper, and 7 sets of furniture, appliances, air conditioners, etc.

12. Electrical power consumption in the U.S. is equivalent to burning 20 tons fo coal per person per year, compared to just 6 tons per person world average.

13. Computers are a mixture of waste problems; televisions last an average of 12.5 years.

14. Holiday meals pull out the food limits 6 times a year, 412 per life.

15. Cars with original parts last an average of 12 years; the U.S. uses half the worlds oil at 31,350 gallons of gas per person per lifetime. The cost of air travel is 20 tons of carbon per year.

16. Our impact on the natural world includes the U.S. consuming 1/4 the worlds minerals; loss of land to development, loss of wild habitat.

17. By old age and our consumption of medication per life averages 37,320 pills.

While the data are based on 2008 levels of consumption, there should be little variation from these figures due to hybrid cars, more energy efficient laptops, etc. since population growth will offset any minor gains in efficiency. No discussion is provided of the massive per capita discrepancies between the Western countries consumption and that of India, China, etc. While China has exceeded the American carbon footprint since this video was made, their per capita energy consumption remains 1/4th that of an American and the issue of our luxurious life versus their sparing conservationist living is not broached. This video can have a role in illustrating that disparity.",1448582400,2,3936,4.990825688073395

A theme of the film is that throughout the life of a person living in a developed country, there is steady and increasing use of resources, and the coinciding pollution.
If a similar show looked at ranchers and charcoal producers in South America and Africa, you would also see sizeable footprints, but the show would be shorter since their impacts don't involve diverse consumer products.
As some studies show, if all of Asia were to live at U.S. consumption levels we would the equivalent of more than one Earth for resources and waste recycling.  In that respect the human footprint issue for the planet as a whole is derived from the product of a) the average footprint per person, times b) the total human population.

It  presents some startling statistics and then graphically and visually depicts the consumption of the items.

3358206,4,B00147F8WS,"This documentry is very effective in delivering the desired goal. To show the public, what items an ""average"" human in an average lifetime and how much of it is needed for each human in the United States. This is useful as, I doubt many of us try and estimate how much of these casual items (needed or not) that we go through. Naturally there will be at least one variation from these statistics for everyone, (vegitarian, smaller house, no children) but that is not important.

Seeing all of these items layed out for us, makes this documentry far more effective. 14,000 small milk caurtons cannot be fully visualized unless you see it for yourself (and note the film people used water in the caurtons, they didn't waste anything). The same is true for everything else, even showers, pills and wardrobe items, all of which we need.

Dispite delivering the message it wants to there are a few flaws. Towards the last third, I feel it becomes harder to listen. Also, of course, not EVERY resource we go through is mentioned, but this is about what humans need to stay alive and be able to go in public, not what is needed to preform every job and dispose of the products we waste. The stats only apply to those in the United States, so many could feel affended perhaps. Finally as this was done a few years back, the size of the footprint has probubly increased by now.

In summary, very useful to know and doesn't leave you feeling negative, as many of these documentries do, just aware of what you will do.",1355875200,,1507,4.533088235294118

To some, this film may encourage change; personally I wasn't motivated to make much of a change.  The Industrial Revolution brought about ways to make our lives easier and have allowed us to get things done quicker, regardless of the price paid.  There won't be a person who watches this movie and decides to stop driving or stop eating for that matter, but it's certainly food for thought.

My big problem with this movie is that we learn that we are wasteful but we do not really learn what we can DO about it. Babies need diapers. It's kind of unavoidable. Oh, you use washable diapers, you say? Well, don't feel too proud of yourself just yet, because they are going to show you the swimming pools-worth of water you will be using to wash them over 2-3 years. A person in Tanzania (or was it Indonesia?) has less of a carbon footprint in their WHOLE LIFE than one of our American babies does in its FIRST YEAR. Well, OK then. WHY??? Is this because they do not use ANY diapers? What exactly do they do instead? Is this a country with a water availability problem? Is it a country with a high infant mortality rate? A low life expectancy?

Our wastefulness is terrible. No solutions were really offered. Recycling? Great. But maybe instead of recycling your phone you could own it for more than 7 months. Manufacturers are part of the problem. Make computers that do not die in 2 years. We do not always WANT to throw things out.

The food seemed like a lot, but hey, we have to eat. I find I am not average. At all. Zero soda cans for me! Zero beer bottles. WAY more milk bottles than average. (I try to be healthy!) I also drink water.... and I will NEVER pay for bottled water unless that is the ONLY thing available. And I am dying of thirst. I am a vegetarian. But, I don't eat much bread. They did not choose any of my preferred fruits. I am surprised any Americans eat that many of ANY fruit. I'm curious how many people are actually ""average,"" but I guess they got these figures somewhere!

I have no comment on the items they ""wasted"" to make this movie... other than I used to almost cry at car chases in movies because I never had a dent-free car until I was 34. We see what other movies do, and this is a representation of one person out of billions.
