5243141,4,B00923MWCK,i have been waiting for this series. haven't even finished it yet but already happy to have bought it. boobs,1368057600,2,108,4.45
5243142,3,B00923MWCK,"Ok, so let me get this out of the way... Queen's Blade is fan service. Some of it gets weird too. So far I have watched the first season. I find myself liking this show for some of the characters and disliking it for others. There is some story going on here as well, but to be honest it is kind of hard to follow with every other shot angled between a sexy character's thighs. I have to laugh when they are showing nothing but boobs and yet the characters are holding a conversation. At first I found Nanael (the angel) to be so annoying, but then she got funny and I enjoy most of the scenes with her and her crazy schemes. Queen's Blade is truly a mixed bag for me and it does have it's moments, so I gave it 3 stars.",1367452800,10,720,4.006944444444445
5243143,5,B00923MWCK,"It's rare for a fighting anime to combine magic with combat, this anime does it well and tells a great story all at the same time, if you like fighting anime's this is one to check out.",1365033600,,185,4.027027027027027
5243144,5,B00923MWCK,It's a great fan service show. Lots of fantasy violence and adventure with a solid plot and character build up. Most of the fan service is above the belt. Great action scenes and a good cast of characters and some good humor. I only had the complete second series and it left me wanting the whole thing. Worth it. Not a lot of sci-fi though.,1361664000,8,341,4.2615384615384615
5243145,5,B00923MWCK,"When you hear Queen's Blade, think fan service.  The story is basically an excuse to show anime girls fighting and losing their clothes during the battle.  Lots of gratuitous panty shots and soft nudity.  Not to be taken too seriously.",1394668800,,235,4.825
5243146,5,B00923MWCK,Very happy with this one! I remember the first time I saw it a few years ago and have hunted for it on youtube off and on trying to re watch it. I finally got fed up with it and just bought it! Very happy! Thank you!,1391385600,,216,3.617021276595745
5243147,5,B00923MWCK,"HEY! I watched it this weekend and i am appauled that everyone forgot the obvious and most important part of this.

Sure there's lots of boobs. And fighting... sometimes in mud pits, but how could you miss it?

YURI! Lesbians! oh it's implied with pretty much all of them except Cattleya, but there were three women that were openly gay and this had nothing to do with the fact that you can count the men in this series on Captain Hook's fingers.

1. The evil elf babe who owns the luckiest snake int he world and who will apparenly hit on anything with breasts provided they don't have a kid.

2. The youngest of three sisters who wants to bang the second youngest like a drum at a Nativa American cultural festival.

3. The undead mummy princess whose plans to resurrect her former kingdom revolve around hypnotising random women into giving her full body oil massages complete with ""Happy endings"".

Somebody should have mentioned this.",1384732800,9,939,4.66060606060606
5243148,4,B00923MWCK,"First thing first, this is a heavy fan service show. Anything that you can think of for a fan service fantasy fighting show is in this show. Queen's Blade takes place in a medieval setting where the next queen is decided by a tournament of female fighters. Its like an election, but a lot more fun. Characters in the tournament include: a thief, a shapeshifter, an elf, dark elf, half-elf, dwarven princess, a ghost maid, a shrine maiden, ninja, an angel, a priestess, a pyromancer, and others.

As mentioned before, this is a fan service show, so you should expect character's clothes to be ripped or torn frequently. Ridiculous outfits or lack of proper clothing are also rampant in this show. Tentacle-like objects do show up every now and then. The first half of the show seems to be more about introducing the characters and using rather unorthodox methods of fan service. The second half of the show is about the actual tournament itself, and less about blatant fan service.

Most of the fighting is pretty good in the anime, and fortunately the fights never exceed one episode in length. You don't have to devote a lot of viewing time to any one particular fight in the show. There are 19 different fighters in this tournament, each with their own story and fighting style. Yes, the characters have their own motivations; its not just a simple fighting show. The main character, Leina, and her older sister, Claudette, have probably the most interesting story of any other characters. This is particularly present in episode 4 of the series.

One aspect of the show to commemorate is the fact that the characters actually look like they belong in a fantasy story. They do not look like big eyed anime schoolgirls; they actually look like warriors. There are a couple of exceptions, but it is rather nice that this show actually deviated from the clich.

This collection does have all 24 episodes of the series as well as actual special features. There is an interview with the Japanese actresses, as well as a mini-series that takes place in a high school setting. These school episodes are even raunchier than the regular series, so beware (or enjoy.) This set is released by Media Blasters, and they mostly did a good job. I say mostly because the first time I bought the set, the second disc did not work. The second set that I got did not have a working third disc, so I ended up buying the third disc alone to replace the defective one. So be careful when purchasing this set online because this happened to me twice.

Overall, this a fun fan service show, if you are into that, it gives the viewer a lot more than they handle. It works a lot better than other fan service shows like Rosario+ Vampire. If you are against fan service shows, I am not really sure why you read this much, as I mentioned many times that this is a very crazy fan service show.",1381190400,11,2866,4.6007827788649704
5243149,5,B00923MWCK,its came in good condition with no problem it is an excellent anime and it was amazing to watch and see,1379289600,,103,3.9523809523809526

5243151,4,B00923MWCK,"I have to admit it has nudity but whoever can't handle it, just shows your a kid. it has story to it. Leina is my favorite character, she never gives up, which gives this anime a story. I was gland that they made the two series in one collection.the DVDs has some defects like can't click features and skip little parts ,but what can I do. characters that I found interesting Leina,Risty,Irma,Echidna,Tomoe,Menace,Nyx,Shizuka,Melona, and Aldra.",1374883200,5,444,5.013513513513513
5243152,1,B00923MWCK,"This is violent kiddie porn plain and simple. Vile and disgusting...this from just a small sample I saw on TV so why would anyone waste time and money on this. The Japanese creators of this drivel are obviously sexually repressed and depraved to put this garbage out. They make characters appear to be young under aged girls portrayed in and doing acts that but for the fact that they are animated makes this child porn...and this makes it OK?

What's this great fan service I keep reading in these reviews? Is it code for good rubbing one out material for us boarder line pedophiles?

Yes...I went there.",1373846400,2,605,4.644859813084112
5243153,5,B00923MWCK,I highly enjoyed this anime. It has lots of action and plenty of fan service. It also has OVA shorts that I found very enjoyable.,1373760000,,129,4.2
5243154,5,B00923MWCK,It arrived in good shape. If I didn't like the movie I wouldn't have ordered it. I will be getting the next season. The movie came just like the product was advertised. Would order from this seller again,1373760000,,203,4.368421052631579
8534547,4,B00923MWCK,"I love the story, I even loved the cloths/armor popping off every time someone got hit for like the first few episodes but that got old fast.. I mean really, every single fight someone gets a lucky hit and knocks the armor off the other women, leaving her topless and exposed every time..  If you are ok with every other view coming from between the legs or from behind or centered on the breast area then this is for you..  Like I said, the story is great if you can get past all the stuff mentioned already",1526688000,,508,4.22680412371134

8534550,3,B00923MWCK,Arrived in great condition but I got disc 2 twice so I need to buy disc three separate or rebuy the series making it inconvenient.,1499472000,,130,4.24
8534551,5,B00923MWCK,"Over-the-top fan service anime. If that is your thing, then this series is a must own. Note if you are looking for something of a more serious variety then i would advise to give this show a pass. It hinges on the ridiculous and absurd so do not expect a grounded plot or characters here. This goes without saying but this is an adult anime and is definitely not for children.",1492646400,,376,4.309859154929577
