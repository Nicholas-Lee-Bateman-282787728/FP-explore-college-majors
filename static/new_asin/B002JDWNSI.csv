3937633,3,B002JDWNSI,"I suppose they thought this was quirky when they wrote it (Tony Hiles, Frances Walsh, and Peter Jackson).

Jack Brown, Genius is a romantic/comedy/fantasy film about a monk who takes possession of an inventor's brain, forcing him to put his life in danger so the monk can fulfill the dream that killed him: flight.  The monk in question (his doomed flight is the movie's prologue) is accused of ""self-murder"" by a toady and that's all it takes to curse him for eons until he takes possession of Jack Brown.  It's a paper thin premise that they try to fill with a few chase sequences and a couple of villains who are desperate to steal one of Brown's earlier inventions.  (Technically, the monk could also be considered a third villain since he cares little for Jack other than using him to get what he wants, a free trip to heaven.)  The humor is mostly subliminal.  Everything is handled in a matter-of-fact style entirely deficient of energy.  It's as though everyone involved lost interest immediately, yet felt the need to finish the project anyway.  It lacks enthusiasm, excitement, and characters we could care about.  Even though Tim Balme is an interesting actor, they really didn't gave him much to do that allowed him to showcase his talents.  (Balme won the 1996 New Zealand Film award for best actor for this film.  Director Tony Hiles also won, as did the score by Michelle Scullion.)

I wasn't impressed, considering the supposed pedigree of the people who made this film.  It was neither terrible nor good, just eh.
It's nothing I'd care to watch again.  Not a keeper.",1402963200,2,1583,4.750915750915751

3937636,3,B002JDWNSI,"Not sure why this film took 14 yrs to be released on DVD but better late then never. It's an interesting insight into the early life of the wingnut films empire, not sure what happened to Tony Hiles but I for one like the film. It's not a laugh a minute or a non stop romp but definitely worth a watch all the same. Some good odd ball characters and one liners, ""I want to sleep with you Eileen"" is a classic.",1310342400,,409,4.0
3937637,5,B002JDWNSI,This is actually a charming little film that surprises you. I highly recommend this mostly unknown movie.,1274572800,2,105,5.235294117647059
