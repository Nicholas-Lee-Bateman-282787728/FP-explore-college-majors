This movie takes you through every emotion. We laughed, we cried, we gripped our hands.--everything.  There were times when my heart was pounding. My mother, who thought she'd fall asleep, not only stayed awake but ended up yelling out loud at the screen! Really, people were cheering.  I am so excited that this is coming out on dvd for my region.",1427414400,45,515,4.410526315789474

6992447,3,B00SU1DDVY,"Frankly, I learned more about the battle from the reviews than I did from the film.
I suspect it was a bit too targetted toward a Korean audience to quite work for someone not part of that culture.
But it was certainly well-done.
Just hard to follow in many details, although the main thread was pretty clear.",1515456000,,309,4.43859649122807
6992448,5,B00SU1DDVY,"One of the best naval movies out there.  Just don't get too hung up on historical details, this movie plays with them just like every action movie  based on a real event does.  The Admiral, which I saw on Netflix, describes one of the most unbelievable navy victories ever where Admiral Yi Sun-shin with only 13 ships defeated a Japanese armada of 100 ships or better (the number depends on whether you count the ships engaged or present.  Now you're asking how does anyone do that? And the answer is let local conditions work for you.  Yi Sun-shin lured the Japanese fleet into a maelstrom. Local fishermen helped in ways both shown and not shown in the film.  Min Sik-choi does a fantastic job in the role of Yi Sun-shin.  The battle scenes are well-filmed, as you would expect in a Korean drama, The director,  Han-min Kim, doesn't drop any of the balls he juggles.  I appreciate all he does, although it is workman-like and never achieves true greatness.  It belongs among the better naval movies, a group, as this retired USN master chief will tell you, is not very strong.",1511568000,,1078,4.596858638743456

6992454,5,B00SU1DDVY,"Greatest naval battle in Korean history? Wow, talk about an undue & underserved modesty. How many engagement land, sea, or air does anyone know of 300 vs 13 odd that resulted in complete & absolute victory? Plus, 26 wins out of 26 engagements with much less favorable condition than the enemy. This battle sealed Japanese aggression toward China & Asia. We also know what happened few hundred years later, when Japanese aggression was unchallenged during WWII. Pearl & Man in the High Castle, few hundred years early?
Notice the torture he suffered by his own jealous King & government at the beginning of the movie. Most, including myself, would likely have defected to the enemy under those circumstances. Instead, he puts his life in the defense of it. Heck, no wonder he is considered as a god by even Japanese & it's most admired admiral Togo Heihachiro quoted ""You may compare me to the Lord Nelson, but compared to Yi Soon Shin, I am only a petty officer.""

6992461,2,B00SU1DDVY,"The story of Admiral Yi is amazing so I am left bewildered why the script writers altered the story and made the accomplishments of Yi less than stellar. Usually, movies embellish tales, this movie is quite the opposite. They took a man of naval god-status and made him just another dude in the sea. The Admiral Yi in the movie makes naval mistakes, mistimes current changes, yada yada, in real life this dude was on point. Very confused why they portray Yi as a bumbling know-nothing. Due to these script inaccuracies, I spent the first 45 minutes of the movie trying to figure out which battle Yi was preparing for, what the heck was going on, and then I realized this movie was simply going to take the entire story of Yi and bundled it into one single battle that does no justice to his life. If you are expecting even a semi-accurate portrayal of Yi, don't get your hopes up, other than by name, Yi is missing from this Korean flick. Finally, simply based on the movies own merit, I probably wouldn't recommend 'The Admiral' because the characters and storyline are quite lacking.",1496620800,,1085,4.597938144329897

Disgraced admiral yi (choi min - sik - lucy old boy) is reinstated to lead the Korean depleted navel force against the final wave of japanese warships with only twelve ships to command against over 300 japanese war vessels yi leads his ship on a suicidal mission to protect his country and change the shape of history. Roaring currents is visually stunning it has epic battle sequences the special effects are amazing jaw - dropping this film recounts one of the greatest navel battles in world history.

Would have been better if given each side clear colors or different amour or anything at all to know which side to cheer for. The best actor in the entire movie was a deaf woman who had two scenes. She stole the entire show. Also I looked up info about the Admiral and was disgusted to find the movie did portray his character right at all. I think its dumb to make a movie about a person and then do the opposite of their personality. Just do a movie about a admiral thats smart in that case!",1467158400,,567,4.0265486725663715
6992498,3,B00SU1DDVY,"The first 40 minutes of the movie was kind of a let down because the story kind of dragged and went on endlessly  with the general in constant conflict with his men over the merits of going into a suicide battle.  The lead actors are not bad at all but the secondary actors are really poor and it takes away from the movie.  Since as a viewer you can pretty much guess the outcome, this time spent bickering and plotting seemed like an eternity even if it did become a crucial plot point later on.

Then you get to the second half of the movie and at this point I give it high credits for both visual appeal and authenticity, with one notable exception.  If Oared boats of that period were really that fast, the USA should be fitting their newest aircraft carriers with Oars.  I guess the real maneuvering speed might have made the movies pace too slow but at some points you could clearly tell they were doing 30+ knots.
Since the main characters are now mostly on the screen and the secondary's fighting and not talking the movie takes on a whole new dynamic and moves from a 2 star to a 4 star movie.  I love historic movies and this one was not a let down!  Be prepared that the title and hype exaggerate the actual scale of the battle, but none the less it was a great portrayal of the real thing and as the movie progresses you get swept up into the battle and the heroics of the men involved.",1466553600,,1399,4.2330827067669174
6992499,3,B00SU1DDVY,"A bit disjointed with poor continuity.  If  you enjoy these types of movies you'll find something here, but it's not the best I've experienced.",1466467200,,143,4.916666666666667
6992500,4,B00SU1DDVY,"This great and exciting film (The Admiral - Roaring Currents, 2014) appears to be a spinoff of, The Alamo (2004 film), about a United States, State of Texas, True battle against the Mexicans.  You will notice many similarities between THE ALAMO and THE ADMIRAL.

The Alamo film (2004) came first, but the writers of THE ADMIRAL film (2014) make us believe they were the originators of the plot by setting their film in 1597, whereas The Alamo is set in 1836.

In both films you have the head military leader coughing up blood into a napkin. The Admiral does so (The Admiral), and Colonel Bowie does so (The Alamo).

Also, the ratio of odds is exactly the same.
The Alamo writers use 180 Texan troops fighting against 5000 Mexican troops. Whereas, The Admiral writers use 12 Korean ships against 330 Japanese ships. That is exactly the same odds ratio.
EXAMPLE:
12 ships times 10 = 120 ships.
330 ships times 10 = 3300 ships.
add half as many more and you get
180 ships against 4950 ships (sounds like 180 men against 5000 men).

Either history repeats herself around the world or else these writers are deceiving us into thinking their plots are original?

Consider the Israelite story of Moses, King Saul, and King David.
Then consider the Roman/Greek story of the Emperor Nero.
Nero's life was very similar to the combined lives of Moses/Saul/David.

Davy Crockett's life can be compared to Jesus Christ in great detail. Davy was even purported to have risen from the dead and appeared to many in Mexico City after the fall of the Alamo (and his death). Davy bled the 5000 whereas Jesus fed the 5000. And so on.

And COL Jim Bowie, COL Davy Crockett, and LT COL William Travis are considered the Holy Trinity of the Alamo.

Perhaps the Admiral is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost all rolled up into one?
Or should I add Moses too, making 4?
We have to add in General Sam Houston into the mix to make a victory for the Texans.
So perhaps the Admiral is:
Moses, God, Jesus, Holy Spirit all rolled up into one, or
Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, William Travis, and Sam Houston all rolled up into one?",1466467200,3,2089,4.549333333333333

6992509,1,B00SU1DDVY,"Yes, modern audiences are sophisticated enough not to be fooled by substandard animation and the animation here is definitely not lacking, and the animators due a superlative job but unfortunately the same cannot be said of their grasp of reality, basic physics and naval warfare.

The ships move around like powered toys. Even if they were steam ships their speed and manoeuverability beggar belief. For one thing, it is a physical impossibility to propel and manoeuvre such wooden behemoths with such a contingent of rowers as was displayed on the screen. The ships are racing around like speedboats (not an exaggeration). Even against powerful currents. Just look at the wakes and the foaming and churning waters around the ships. This is a dead giveaway. You would think there was an engine powering them.

And what about sail?  None of the naval engagements involve sails, especially during manoeuvers which require a precise dance of sail and oar. I cannot believe for a moment that this is how how these specific naval engagements were fought back then.
Otherwise, this is an excellent storyline believably portrayed.",1463184000,,1124,5.131147540983607

A lot of this movie's dialogue is spoken in Japanese, but all of the actors with Japanese roles struggle with the script (with the exception of one actor who is actually Japanese). They even seem to overact in an attempt to make up for their poor diction, so the Japanese scenes come off more like a comedy sketch parodying foreign historical dramas. It would have been better if they either cut down the amount of Japanese dialogue or gave more of those roles to Japanese speakers.
Either way, the rest of the movie made up for that issue, so I still enjoyed watching this.",1457481600,2,710,4.642857142857143

Brilliant!  A little too violent for my taste but this is one very inspiring film.  Nothing is perfect and I am sure you can pick many flaws in this film if you are inclined to but this is definitely one of the best movies I have seen in recent times.  I am seeing so much trash in the name of entertainment these days that a movie like this comes as a long awaited breath of fresh air.

This is a Korean film and I am sure the impact of the film will be a lot more in its original format in the native tongue.  A lot of the cultural significance, emotions and message can be lost in translation.  But it is still very effective for a foreign audience like me even with the shortcomings of subtitles and English voice overlayed on the original dialogues. Many folks are undermining this film because it is a foreign film.  It is like saying a great Hollywood film is bad simply because the Korean subtitles and Korean translation of the film is not done well.  It does take away some of the finer points of the movie but you can still enjoy any good foreign movie even with all associated cultural and language constraints.  This is perhaps the first Korean movie I have ever seen. And if this is what Korea has to offer I am certainly checking out Korean films in future.

This is one of those few movies that will stay with you for a long time unlike the current crop of big budget Hollywood entertainers that you see and forget the very next minute.",1444003200,,1600,4.31438127090301

6992535,5,B00SU1DDVY,"This film can be best described in one word: 'exhilarating'.  This is especially true of the last hour of this two hour film and I can go far as to say that you will find yourself cheering Yi Sun-Sin, the Admiral.  You will find yourself caught up in his situation, one which most commanders would wish they never found themselves in.  Yi must not only survive but also defeat insurmountable odds in order to save his country.  This is an true story and if you find yourself doubting it, just do the research and you will find the Admiral was in reality even more remarkable than shown in this film.

As a movie, this film is far better than most of the recent epics we have seen from the likes of Marvel and DC.  Better, because it is genuinely engrossing, captivating and, as I said right at the beginning, exhilarating.  Better because this is no fantasy or sci-fi but a story taken from history and about a man who was a brilliant commander but also found time to be loyal, fair and compassionate to one and all but also led Korea to defend itself successfully against Japanese aggression despite never having the amount of supplies and equipment his foes did.  In real life, Yi is regarded as the one of the greatest naval commander who ever lived by military historians and naval commanders alike, as great as Nelson and Halsey, if not greater.  The movie is really well made with excellent actors taking up the lead roles in a well told story,  and the set design and costuming is simply stunning and rivals any Hollywood epic and then some.

This is a Korean film and even though there is an English soundtrack available, I strongly suggest you watch it in the original Korean with English subtitles to enjoy the full flavour!  I have become jaded by recent Hollywood offerings and this film has restored my faith that a film can be commercial but also fun, enjoyable and can capture your complete attention.  This film ranks right up there with 'Gladiator', 'Spartacus' and 'Saving Private Ryan' and perhaps it may not have the polish of those films and their respective film-makers but it makes up for it with a real story told in a way that found me watching it with the awe I first had when watching 'Jaws' as a ten year old.  No wonder it was the biggest film ever in Korea in 2014.

The battle zone? A bay off of the high seas. The odds? 12 ships and one seasoned ADMIRAL who was considered to be ""...in disgrace..."", against the vast fleet of 330 ships which were manned by the enslaved populous. The Emperor's arrogant and 'predicted' outcome? Total annihilation of THE ADMIRAL - Yi Sun-shin and his ""mere"" 12 ships against his 330. This historical, action/adventure is considered to be the greatest naval battle that ever took place. One ADMIRAL against several..., and 12 ships against 330? The odds were more than overwhelming. They were astronomical! No sane, Naval Commanding Officer would dare too imagine, let alone..., actually send Naval Seamen against such an Armada. But THE ADMIRAL Yi Sun-shin, didn't have a choice. He was ordered by the Joseon Dynasty to lead the last remaining 12 ships against the Emperors' 330, like it or not. And as a bonus burden, the sailors on the 12 ships were terrified of the prospects and almost had a mutiny, even before they set sail. So, the good ADMIRAL, already burdened by the overwhelming odds had to convince his crew to remain calm, fight and have a winning attitude because anything, was possible! This superb, historical, Naval Battle as depicted on the big-screen, comes to it's audience on a single, color, DVD-disc, in English and runs approximately 128-minutes in length. You don't have to be a historian or a military buff to appreciate this enthralling, edge-of-your-seat, monumental and miraculous, Naval Battle. This film is as mesmerizing as it is, riveting. And you' ll find yourself cheering for the underdog ADMIRAL, every step of the way. Because although THE ADMIRAL was ordered into this battle, he wasn't a coward and didn't attempt to run away. That alone, in the face of such odds, is a unique form of bravery and a colossal miracle. That is why this movie is an absolute 'must see' and a definite keeper for your home DVD library.

6992545,5,B00SU1DDVY,"SPOILER.

The movie does an excellent job imparting several moral messages based upon Yi Sun-Sin's philosophy and speeches about war as a triumph over fear.  This would have been academy award material except there are a few schlocky time-stop sequences and the first 50% of the movie (all the buildup) was edited to be about 5 minutes too long.  Please pause the subtitles at the beginning and UNDERSTAND ALL THE BACKGROUND (which is 100% true).  15M out of 50M Koreans saw this movie when first released in 2013, an all-time box-office record.

I will list some facts about the battle known and unknown to me.  Please comment on this review so we can move the unknowns to Facts or Poetic License.  Thanks!

Poetic License

1. Yi's ship was never boarded. Those battles happened to his second in command.
2. Bae Soel (who saved the 12 ships) fled the night before but was not killed then. He was later found hiding in his home village and killed.
3. There was no mutinous attempt to kill Yi the night before battle.
4. Deaf wife screaming. She spent the whole movie screaming.  I think she was a trope.
5. Battle time was chosen deliberately to leverage the tides via Yi sending a scout ship to lure the japanese fleet towards Myeongnyang at the right instant.  This was omitted from the movie.
6. Turtle ships are heavily armored ships with 4 innovations (a) Covered roofs with spikes to prevent boarding, (b) larger, (c) Cannons on starbord, port, fore, and aft with dragonhead for smokescreens or to emit poisonous gas (d) fully armored (with thick wood) to protect crew from bullets.
7.  There was no turtle ship under construction.  Yi planned to scare Michifusa with a ship modified to look like a Turtle ship, but there was no time.

True

1. Won Gyun had Yi imprisoned & tortured and lost Yi's fleet in only 4 months
2. The emperor released Yi from prison and he had only 12 ships and days to fight with.
3. Peasant fishermen donated 32 narrow (not battle) ships to the fight
4. At the outset the other 11 ships held back and Yi's flagship fought alone
5. It was 12 ships against 131 according to journals of Yi and his nephew
6. Of the other ~200 ships, most were supply ships and troop carriers (non-lethal)
7. Yi invented modern cannon-based naval warfare. No need to say more
8.  Yi hung a general's (not Michifusa's but Madashi's) head from his flagship.  Madashi was killed, however, close enough.

Not Sure

1. Was the village actually burned down
2. Were all the Japanese atrocities (decapitations) documented true
3. Was Yi actually 200 years ahead of everybody else in political thought
4. Was there really a bomb ship
5. Was it peasants who saved Yi's ship from the whirlpool",1440892800,2,2695,4.635789473684211

6992555,5,B00SU1DDVY,"Blown away. I was drained by the end of the movie.  Each battle scene was followed by a more intense scene. Just when things looked hopeless ....I knew nothing of this history. If you want to be be picky, the CGI was crude in parts and the dubbing a little off. The initial acting was cheesy in parts. So what. Still a great movie. This makes the Master and Commander type British naval battles look tame. The uniforms, weapons, ships, and tactics are all new to me and fun to observe.",1438387200,,485,4.329670329670329
6992556,5,B00SU1DDVY,"Im a military history and war movie buff and this ranks as one of the best ever. Yi Sun-sin, virtually unknown outside of Korea, has to be considered one of the greatest military commanders of all time for what he achieved during this Imjin War between Korea (then called Joseon) and a newly united Japan from 1592 to 1598.

This movie is specifically regarding a naval battle known as Myeongryang in 1597 when things were looking very bleak for Korea in its conflict with Japan. Yi Sun-sin, hopelessly outnumbered with his troops demoralized and full of fear, somehow takes a small fleet of 12 ships against an onslaught of 330 Japanese ships and again emerges victorious in a dramatic fashion.

This is truly a great all-around movie - not just a great war movie. The acting is superb, the action scenes are realistic, the story is well-paced, the special effects are proficiently employed and the movie is emotionally charged. Yi Sun-sin was not only a genius military strategist and tactician but he was also a great human being - virtuous, loyal, honest, inspiring, and genuinely caring for the people of the Korean (Joseon) nation he has committed himself to defend against the invaders.

A great movie is more than entertainment for 2 hours. It leaves you thinking about it for days and weeks after you viewed it and inspires you in many ways. Not only do you want to watch it again but it makes you delve deeper into the story, the characters, the setting, the environment, the culture and the history. This is such a movie.

Although not a conqueror like other brilliant and famous military geniuses and leaders such as Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan and Napoleon, Yi Sun-sin has to be ranked up there with the very best in the annals of military history for consistently winning (23 battle victories with 0 defeats) against what seemed like insurmountable odds - especially this amazing battle that the movie is about.",1438300800,,1946,4.817365269461078

6992558,5,B00SU1DDVY,"This comes from director Ha - min Kim who also brought us `War of the arrows' and is about the second Japanese invasion of Korea in 1597 - the first being 1592. Admiral Yi sun-sin had led the Korean navy and proven to be a worthy adversary but due to in fighting at court and his reluctance to follow orders he had been arrested and even tortured.

Then the Japanese invade again and they had already wiped out the navy at the battle of Chilchonryang and so expected only resistance on land. So they advanced with all the rapine and pillaging that went with war and sadly still does. However there was a rump of a navy left and Yi, now reinstated, decided to lead them to face a far superior enemy. The Japanese had around 330 ships and he had just thirteen.

What follows is a recreation of the Battle of Myeongnyang and I have to say it is ruddy brilliant. I researched the battle and all of the events depicted are recorded as having taken place. Obviously there is a ton of poetic licence but it hardly matters when you are faced with film making on a scale like this. They have recreated the actual oar powered ships and there is a bucket load of CGI which is all on the excellent side.

The acting is like a lot of Korean cinema in that it can be a bit over the top emotionally at times - but that goes with the territory and I am not in the least fazed by it. The fight scenes are amazing and choreographed to a point that defies imagination. Check out the fighting monks all sporting the swastika (sign of peace variety). This is a fight fest par excellence and even the music is great; it has been a while since I could really rave about a film and thanks to this the wait is over - absolutely and utterly recommended.",1437523200,12,1727,4.243161094224924

6992568,3,B00SU1DDVY,"Overly-dramatic and slightly disappointing, some of it far too silly for such an important subject - the most astonishing victory in the history of naval warfare fought by an amazing man, but sad to say it's almost B-grade at times. It could and should have been a great movie, but it isn't!

The 2005 Korean drama series ""Immortal Yi Soon-Shin"" does a far better, more exciting and realistic job of depicting this battle and Admiral Yi's life and times than this movie does. It is advertised on Amazon as unavailable...it is still possible to find it if you know where to look. It's a great series.

Why was the only female in the movie cast as a mute? (girls should be seen but not heard?..ha)
Why such a cameo role for the amazing Turtle Ship? The makers went to such lengths and expense to re-construct one, yet there were only a few glimpses of it. This was the world's first iron-clad assault ship, that wreaked havoc on the Japanese ships. True, there were no surviving Turtle Ships at the battle of Myeongryang, but neither was one burnt down by Yi's mutinous officers before the battle as shown in the movie. Since it was in the film, we could have seen more of it in action during the lead-up to the battle...that would have been much more interesting and factual than some fictitious and melodramatic burning.

The Subtitles....
the English dubbing with stagey American accents on 16th century Koreans is truly atrocious. It's unwatchable...that leaves the subtitles...

I have a cheap $9 Malaysian version of this movie, with the English translation often more accurate and meaningful than the American version. Hard to believe but true...some examples:

Admiral Yi is asked by his son what miracle saved him...in the Asian version Yi replies ""Heaven helped us."" Fair enough.
The Americans had him replying ""It was the grace of God!"" What a joke!

In the US version he refers to the Korean villagers as ""the peasants""! In the Asian version he much more respectfully describes them as ""the people"".
He says regarding the miracle in the Asian version, ""the people who came to save me.""
Continuing with the grace of God nonsense, Yi is asked by his son in the US version, ""The peasants were the grace of God?"" Yi replies, ""What's more likely to be the grace of God?"" This is really ridiculous coming from a 16th century Buddhist or Confucianist. Is this translator a time-travelling born-again zealot?

The Buddhist monk armies played a crucial role in expelling the Japanese invaders, and it was good to see them arrive to offer their assistance - praying, rowing and eventually much more hands-on...in the US version Yi says to the monks, ""your assistance is much appreciated"". How perfunctory!
Boring and uninspiring compared to the heart-felt Asian version, ""You have my gratitude. Your presence gives me strength.""

After surviving the horrific battle Yi is offered a tiny snack of taro balls. The insipid American translation says, ""It feels good to eat."" Like he's getting into a big Mac after work.
The Asian version says, with so much more true feeling after surviving that hell, ""How wonderful it is to be alive and eat this.""

After the battle Yi looks at the carnage around him and the villagers on the shore who helped...the lame US version says ""how can we ease their suffering?"", referring to the people.
The Asian version gives us a totally different viewpoint: he says, not to the villagers, but more to himself, ""what shall we do...with all this hatred between us?"" Meaning between the Koreans and the Japanese...surely a far more profound, powerful, poignant and fitting comment!

You American translators need to re-study, and with the grace of God you might get to take some lessons in English expression from Asians!

It isn't very often that a film is able to combined so many high quality elements. The story is fascinating, especially since it is so poorly known i the West. The costuming is wonderful and the full scale ships are amazing, as are the fight sequences. This movie is rewarding on so many levels that I am really sad I never got to see it in a theater.",1432166400,,452,4.267441860465116
6992588,4,B00SU1DDVY,I saw this in Korea in the theater. It is a well-made big budget epic naval battle movie. It is quite enjoyable as such but it also offers a fascinating insight into Korean society and the way Korea views itself in the world. Worth watching for both reasons.,1432166400,8,258,4.395833333333333

6992595,5,B00SU1DDVY,"An awesome movie with big budget and long time to complete. Just look at the costumes, already well worth the money. This movie has great plot, great acting, plus great pictures (if you are watching it in high definition). The never-say-die attitude by the Admiral makes this movie very interesting, 12 ships versus the enemy's 300?? The fighting scenes are also beautifully put together. This is the first Korean-made fighting movie, and I love it. Watched it three times already within a week. You won't be disappointed, and I rated this 5 out of 5.",1431129600,21,551,4.810526315789474

6992597,5,B00SU1DDVY,"First of all, let me preface this review with my familiarity with Asian Cinema.  I am what you would call a fair to good fan of Asian Cinema Historical Epics.  Being a History Major, I enjoy historical epics of all kinds due to costuming and battle tactics in each era of cinematic viewing.  I've got about a half shelf full of Asian epics like this, so I'm fairly familiar with the genre.  That said, not many, if any, of these films ever touch me emotionally, mainly because I don't know the culture of the history all that well, then of course the language barrier (subtitles, et al) hurts the problem as well

Well, Admiral was different for some reason.. The first hour was a bit slow, a lot of setting up main characters and the reasons for the coming battle, but once the battle got started, which lasted the entirety of the second half of the film, it was highly emotional and engaging.  I don't know if it was the musical cues or just the sheer suspense and tension of the engagements in the battle, but I caught myself wanting to tear up at times.  This film is compared to 2008's ""Red Cliff"" of which I have also, but I have yet to watch the naval battle part of it, ironically, so I don't know how it compares to Admiral in terms of realism and emotionally.

Admiral takes place in the 1590s  If your familiar with the timeline in the PC game Total War: Shogun II, it takes place during the Shogun era of the game.  So I was very familiar with the armor, weapon, and ship types in this film.  The ship types range from small attack craft, usually manned by archers, to these large mufti-level (3-4 decks) wooden boxy ships that are mainly used as cannon platforms and boarding party ships.  Essentially the 16th Century version of Asian Pirate Ships.

But anyway, the battle which is both deadly and bloody, it's actually quite spectacular in fact.  It's no wonder why it's the top grossing film in Korean film history.  The Blu-ray comes labeled with just a Dolby Digital soundtrack...but that is incorrect.  It has DTS-HD 5.1 tracks in both English and Korean, and PCM 2.0 tracks in both too  Extras a severely limited in just the trailers and a highlights of the film featurette.",1430956800,13,2194,4.5

6992599,4,B00SU1DDVY,"I normally like these movies but this one did little for me. Its the story of one of Korea greatest naval victories but somehow the movie just did not grab me.

On the plus side it has some brilliant battle scenes. The photograph is very good. If you are going to see it, make sure you have a good scene.

Update: I was not happy after seeing the movie yesterday as I felt I missed much so what I did is read up on the story in the Wikipedia. I then as I watched it paused the film to find out facts that I did not know. As the film followed closely what happened, I could follow the story and enjoyed it. I suspect one reason that the movie was so popular with people in Korea is because they know the story. For a non-Korean, I suggest you read up on the story first before attempting to view it, otherwise, you could get lost like I did.",1430611200,6,840,4.023952095808383

6992601,4,B00SU1DDVY,"A South Korean production that broke records at the South Korean box office, Admiral is obviously a ""feel-good"" movie for Korean viewers since the Japanese get their heads handed to them in a frankly humiliating defeat (the Battle of Myeongnyang).

PROs
 Absolutely beautiful cinematography and costumes/regalia
 The battle scenes look so real that you often can't tell where the sets end and the CGI begins
 Rare insight into Eastern 16th century naval warfare
 History as art; this film has a heart and soul

CONs
 The first half is dragged down by lots of scenes with testosterone-ridden military officers childishly and melodramatically roaring at each other
 Overbearing jingoism muddies the waters; I would have preferred a little less ""Hollywood"" (whatever the Korean equivalent is) and a little more historical accuracy
 The musical score is ambitious, but grandiloquent; constantly clashing cymbals become so overused that their purpose is defeated

Admiral is the kind of movie you're likely to view more than once; I watched it dubbed the first time (to keep focused on the action), but may watch it again with subtitles at some point in the future since you almost get a different film when watching without dub.",1430524800,6,1224,5.16751269035533

6992603,5,B00SU1DDVY,"Saw this in Los Angeles movie theater in 2014 with my family. My 10 year old son loved it.  Called it the greatest movie he has ever seen. Blu Ray DVD arrived less than 2 days, great.  The Admiral: Roaring Currents, which chronicles the Battle of Myeong-Nyang in 1597 where a dozen Korean battleships led by Admiral Yi Sun-sin fended off a Japanese fleet of 330 battleships. The images looks fantastic and really does bring out the rich colors of the Japanese and Korean armor. The CGI is good, not easy enough to distinguish what is real and what is virtual. The images is free of any noticeable flaws. The sounds are great with roaring cannons, crashing waves and the screams of sailors, pounding sounds of war without leaving the viewer shell shocked in the process. English dubbing was terrible as you should listen in Korean with English subtitles.  Bonus materials in Blu-ray comes up short, offering only a short ""making of"", a teaser and full trailer. The Admiral Roaring Currents is truly an epic in every way. Its telling of an underdog force fending off villainous invaders easily translates to the exotic location of late 16th century Korea. It looks and sounds great on Blu-ray and this one is surly one of the great naval epics ever made.",1430438400,27,1252,4.707762557077626
