8143756,5,B000I2KQJK,"Having been born in the 1960's, watching movies from that time is nostalgic. Being American, I never saw any of these, and they are hilarious and classic!
Evidently, French humor at the time was different from American humor in that there are few funny lines (dialog). The comedy comes from from the actions of a bunch of goofy characters. It is not about the story, but the silly/goofy things people do, without explanation or setup. So often I ask myself, ""where did that come from?"" But it is really funny. Also clean.
I want to talk about my impression of the first movie. The protagonist is not entirely a nice guy and definitely has character defects. But not so mean that we aren't sympathetic. And his lovely young daughter (Genvieve Grad) is cute and innocent, but also somewhat of a bad girl. In an American comedy, the main characters would not be this complex and it works because you really can't predict what they're going to do next. Surprisingly the second movie is even funnier than the first. I'm looking forward to seeing the 3rd.
The closest analog in American movies of the time might be Peter Seller's Pink Panther movies because it is the characters that provide the humor. But they aren't funny in the same way at all. There aren't many punch lines, but I still laugh out loud at the ridiculous situations.

Beware, this version has no subtitles! I wish it did, but even with my mediocre french I got most of the humor. There are a lot of sight gags.",1506211200,,1474,4.583333333333333
