8433130,5,B004KLVWN4,This is a wonderful documentary about our USA synchronized swim team in 2004. It chronicles how the girls train to get qualified for the Olympics and also follows them through the 2004 Olympic games.

8433132,5,B004KLVWN4,"An excellent piece of work. It truly demonstrates the power, grace, finesse, grit and determination that goes into the sport including the highs and lows and the selection process. Not only that, it follows the life of the girls up to the event, including the story of one girl who took a serious injury and personal tragedy and recovered.

Loved the bit when they entered the Olympic Stadium, that was taken on a home video, and really captures the excitement of the opening ceremony from the athletes perspective.",1306195200,4,515,4.8522727272727275
8433133,5,B004KLVWN4,"I'm the father of an 8 year old synchronized swimmer and our whole family loves Sync or Swim!  It is a movie filled with wonderful role models for girls, but also stories for adults. The women in the documentary are real people as well as Olympian athletes, and to see their champion attitudes and perseverance through life's obstacles -- from the hard work of constant practice, to dealing with asthma in a sport where breathing is critical, to working through major life tragedies -- makes them role models for the rest of us as well.",1306022400,4,536,4.6421052631578945
8433134,5,B004KLVWN4,"Sync or Swim gives viewers an incredible look into the intensely competitive, detail-oriented, and often ""misunderstood"" world of synchronized swimming.  As a former synchronized swimmer and absolute enthusiast of the sport, I count Sync or Swim among one of my favorite movies--largely because it paints the sport in such a positive light.  Sync or Swim chronicles the journey of nine synchronized swimmers on their journey from Olympic try-outs through grueling training sessions and all the way to a bronze medal finish at the Olympic Games.  The wonderful thing about Sync or Swim is that it's not only a story about synchronized swimmers, it's a story about nine all-American young ladies with a common dream.  The emotions and trials that the athletes face throughout the movie are not unique to synchronized swimmers, rather, they are intensely human and appeal to anyone with dreams and aspirations.  A fantastic, awe-inspiring, and tear-jerking movie!",1305763200,,960,5.373333333333333
8433135,5,B004KLVWN4,"This is a wonderful documentary that I watched like it was a feature film.  The film does a phenomenal job showing both the artistry and athleticism of synchronize swimming as an Olympic sport.  Following the run up to the Greece Olympics, it does a great job showing what it takes to be an Olympic athlete in a lower profile sport-- all of the trial competitions, the hours and hours in the pool, and the mundane ways the swimmers support themselves and their team out of the pool.

As a former competitive swimmer who was in the stands for synchro's inaugural Olympics and who competed in synchro for several summers, I thought I knew a lot about this sport.  At the end of the hour and a half I spent with Sync or Swim, I had a new appreciation!!  And, aside from the film, the DVD extras are great!

This is a great film to show for an academic class, to watch to learn more about synchro beyond Esther Williams, or to just have an entertaining evening.",1305763200,4,957,4.409090909090909
8433136,5,B004KLVWN4,"Wow, what an amazing documentary.  Sync or Swim tells the story to a group of ladies trying to qualify to go to the Olympics in Greece.  You see the incredibly hard work that goes into their training, how they earn a living, and how they deal with everything life throws their way during the year of training.

If you are still thinking of Esther Williams style synchronized swimming then you really have to watch this.  These ladies are amazing athletes and the grace they show under pressure is awe inspiring. I think that most people don't realize what synchro is about and this documentary will make you want to go find a pool and do a ballet leg!",1305504000,4,651,4.491525423728813
8433137,5,B004KLVWN4,"I have been a competitive synchronized swimmer for many years at many different levels and this documentary accurately portrays the sport and its Olympic trials process for both veteran synchronized swimmers and those with no relationship with the sport. It also tells a story of perseverance, hard work, and success that anyone can identify with. I would recommend it to anyone, no matter their athletic status!",1305072000,2,412,5.257575757575758
8433138,5,B004KLVWN4,"I purchased this DVD to help teach my high school physical education class synchronized swimming.  I wanted the DVD to help give my class the best start to understanding the sport and a small history of the sports beginning.  The documentary focused on synchronized swimming as an Olympic sport and the dedication that it takes to be on the team as well as their journey through the Olympic experience.  My class loved the DVD and the educational information it provided for my class was extremely helpful.  This was a fantastic video, not only for teaching purposes, but also for personal enjoyment.  I will use this DVD over and over again to help in all my classes and for my own personal entertainment.",1305072000,4,706,4.754098360655738
