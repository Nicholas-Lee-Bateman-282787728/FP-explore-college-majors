8306231,5,B001GN21XY,I'm not very coordinated so I don't do the aerobics tapes. This one doesn't required me to remember multiple moves in split second movements.,1406505600,,141,4.916666666666667
8306232,5,B001GN21XY,"This is a low impact exercise routine that is great for beginners.  If you are heavy or not used to much regular exercise, this workout is a good way to get started with moderate exercise.  Yes, as you get more advanced, and hopefully in better shape, you will need to advance to a higher degree of difficulty.  I am not there yet, but that is my goal!  The host is not intimidating or annoying (as some are) plus has a pleasant Aussie accent!  As I advance I plan to stay with the Lucy Knight series.",1301097600,,501,4.231578947368421
8306233,2,B001GN21XY,"The DVD exercise portion is divided into 4 sections: Warm-Up (sitting, bouncing, lifting & walking around the ball), Toning (crunches & tiny hip thrusts), Floorwork (a tricep dip, hip thrusts, inner thigh exercises), & Stretching

Bad: Not challenging at all.  This workout would probably only help invalids or those recovering from strokes.  You'll only lose a modicum of weight with this if you are in horrible shape & after a month will need to spend money on a new beginner DVD that is a typical difficulty.  With this workout, you just barely break a sweat & there's only light muscle challenge.  The exercise ball is not even really necessary for most of the exercises.  If you do a Google search for stability ball exercises, you'll find lots of great moves that the gym ball enhances but none of them are used here.  No push-ups, planks, bridges, back or side extensions, wall squats, knee tucks, or ball passes.  It is mentioned on the DVD case that the gym ball can help with posture which is something I bought it for, but there was no discussion of it during the exercises & I really feel like there was no improvement afterwards.  No discussion about proper alignment, such as ear over shoulder over hip, & next to no strengthening of back muscles to correct keyboard slouch.

Good: The intro discusses if you are a heavier person, you may need to start with a ball designed for a slightly taller person to accommodate you at first which I had never heard before.  The moves are low impact, relaxing, & easy to follow.  With a gym/stability ball you get a bigger range of motion for crunches.

To make this a decent gym ball exercise DVD there need to be more techniques demonstrated to increase the difficulty level, more muscle groups being targeted, & use exercises where the gym ball is actually important.  In conclusion, don't buy this video.",1275350400,,1861,4.7213622291021675
