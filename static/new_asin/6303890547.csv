721900,5,6303890547,"Thank God the scriptwriter took liberties with ""Around the World in  Eighty Days""! I read the book, and couldn't stand it. I watched the  movie, and became addicted.
Pierce Brosnan's Phileas Fogg has a sterile,  lifeless, prescripted life as a proper upper-class English gentleman. He  plays card games at a men's club, wants his bath at precisely the right  temperature, and speaks in a monotone. But when a bunch of men at the club  wager against him that he can't go ""around the world in eighty  days,"" Fogg is suddenly fired with a desire to do that. He sets off  across the world with his comedic new French valet, Passepartout (Eric  Idle.. yes, THAT Eric Idle!).
But a bank robbery in London leaves Fogg as  the primary suspect. He can't be arrested until he's on English soil, and  the rather inept Detective Fix (Peter Ustinov) is sent off to bring him  back.
But as we watch, Fogg's personality alters. He and Passepartout  manage to save the life of a beautiful Indian princess, Aouda, and as the  trip progresses, Fogg becomes less icy and ""proper."" How many  proper Englishmen would fall in love with an Indian princess?
Brosnan and  Idle are at their simple best. Idle's rather pathetic Passepartout is a bit  irritating at times, but he has endearing moments as well, such as when he  waves goodbye to girlfriend Madeleine.
 Brosnan's Phileas Fogg seems like  a standard cold fish at first, but the viewer cheers as he shouts  ""Stop!"" at the Indians trying to kill Princess Aouda, or when he  faces down a firing squad with steely courage, or when he admits for the  first time that he loves the princess.
Julia Nickson-Soul is the exotic  Princess Aouda, the Indian girl who is almost killed after her loveless  husband dies. But after she is rescued, she becomes an invaluable asset to  the journey. When I was little, I was simply transfixed by the array of  colorful, beautiful saris she wears throughout it.
It travels all across  the world, from the look-but-don't-touch grandeur of London, to the ornate  beauty of China, to the sweaty jungles of Asia, to the plains of the USA.  For an exotic and well-scripted adventure/romance/travel/comedy, look no  further!",968630400,10,2184,4.8059299191374665
721901,4,6303890547,"Phileas Fogg is more real, more human in this version than in the 1956 version played by David Niven.  I found the action, coupled with the constantly changing pieces of the plot kept my attention better as well.  It's still a long epic, but worth the viewing.
I enjoyed the developing  humanity and tenderness of Phileas Fogg as he struggles to break with his  stiff, English background and allow himself to love and express that love  to Aouda, the Indian princess.
Excellent for the incurable romantic.",961718400,4,505,4.825581395348837

721903,2,6303890547,"This DVD was not good. It wasn't the worst thing ever, but it was bad enough that if you had the chance to watch it on TV for free, you'd probably change the channel.
So why did I buy it?  Well, I like Pierce  Brosnan and Eric Idle, I liked the Jules Verne book and I am interested in  geographical and historical movies.  This movie seemed like a good solid  choice.  Plus it was a mini series so I figured I was getting more running  time for my money.
Instead of picking apart everything bad about it, let  me just say that the historical events and places that are visited are NOT  accurate or realistic.  Every place seems fake and has stereo-typical  inhabitants. On the other hand it doesn't play well as a comedy or satire  either. It is basically a boring trip around the world with  not-particularly-inventive plotlines and sets that seem a couple of inches  deep.  I know that Jules Verne kind of went along with the stereo-typical  views of the Orient and America so maybe the show is true to the book.  However, a better choice would have been to have taken the time and spent  the money to make each of the places that are visited more accurate and  realistic.

721980,3,6303890547,"I wish I could give this review two and a half stars.  For a ""made for TV movie"" the production values, in terms of locations and TV talent, are fairly decent, but the cinematography is really basic.  The compulsion for audiences to see this film was to show an English gentleman broadening his horizons from the privileged white social circle to one of enlightened internationalist.  The producers wanted to show English speaking audiences the benefit of knowing people from all social groups.

Regrettably the production is rather plane, and looks like a made for TV movie.  The DVD issues I have is a duplicate from what looks like a half inch copy.  No remastered negative here, just a simple copy from a copy.  Which is too bad, because in order to sell this mini series on the home video market it really needed to be dusted off and polished.

There's nothing wrong with the actors, they're all A-Class material.  Unfortunately they're in a mid-budget range production with lots of master shots hoping that the actors can carry the film's narrative forward.  It only just works, and the results are functional--no more, no less.

As for the story material, I must confess that I've never read Verne's classic tale, but, were he alive today, I would tend to think he would be somewhat amused and altogether disappointed at the same time that the film is plain, basic, and is more of a demonstration of character than exploring how mister Fogg becomes enlightened from his travels.

It's the kind of film that I might have flocked to as a younger viewer with the enticement of Pierce Brosnan gallivanting around the globe with lots of recognizable name actors.  And, once the miniseries had finished I would have felt disappointed, let down, yet strangely glad I had seen it, as was probably the intent all along.

In social psychology terms it's a film meant to enlighten viewers on how we are all the same people the world over, as is the spirit of mister Verne's tale.

Huge in scope, lack luster execution, it might be worth grabbing a cheap used copy, but you might want to save some money and grab a copy at the library.",1488844800,,2130,4.688172043010753
721981,5,6303890547,"DVD comparison is at the end of the review.

I'm tempted to knock a star off of this movie, because it's not perfect, but judging it based on what it is (a 1989 made for TV mini-series), and the scope (an adventure that runs around the world), it's about as close to perfect as it could be.

If you don't enjoy classic television, or understand that this isn't going to be in HD Widescreen (because that wasn't the way it was shot), then you probably won't like this nearly as much as I do.

What this mini-series is, is a product of its time. Yes, the acting is over-the top, and the balloon looks like the Good Year Blimp with a sheet over it, but that's part of its charm.

I really loved this when it was broadcast on television. I was a big Pierce Brosnan fan because of the TV series Remington Steele. I actually recorded it off of television and kept those VHS tapes for many years. I later bought a retail VHS copy that was edited, but still fun to watch.

Now for the DVD comparison. I've owned one release for a while, but since people have complained about the quality, I thought I would look at some other editions to see if the quality was any better.

The good news is that the one that's most easily available at the time of this review, is probably the one you want to get. I've added numbered pictures so that it's easier to identify the DVDs.

Number 1: 2011 release by Harmony Gold and Entertainment One (eone). This 2 DVD version has a listed running time of 285 minutes; screen format of 4x3 (1.33:1); Dolby Digital (stereo) audio; and includes English Subtitles. Picture quality looks like it was converted from an NTSC analog tape master. On my HDTV, I see some interlacing issues, so the transfer probably could be bettter, but it's not bad, and I expect it may be the best we ever get. The only real complaint I have with this release, is that there are previews for three R-rated films at the beginning of this mostly family friendly mini-series.

Number 2: 2003 release by Harmony Gold and ADV Films. This 2 DVD version has a listed running time of 270 minutes, but honestly, I don't understand why. Both this version and the ""eone"" release have two discs with three parts, each running approx. 95 minutes. That's 285 minutes. Anyway, It looks like both this version and the ""eone"" version were made from the same digital master, as I could not see any picture quality difference when making a visual comparison, although they are compressed at different rates. As far as quality goes, I would say that there is no difference between this release and the ""eone"" release, except that this version does not have subtitles. So no reason to upgrade, unless you want subtitles.

Number 3: 2004 Single DVD release by Trinity Home Entertainment. I've seen slightly varying cover art, but I expect they are all the same versions. This is one to stay away from. I always suspect that people who say that a DVD looks worse than a VHS copy are exaggerating, but this really does look like it was copied from a poor VHS copy. It has a listed running time of 266 minutes, and I verified that to be accurate. It's shorter than both of the other ones, so it's probably edited down, but I didn't sit through the whole thing. It has all three episodes jammed together, instead of being separate parts, but inexplicably, also has the commercial bumpers included. Why? Can't recommend this one at all.",1485993600,4,3409,4.512155591572123

722045,2,6303890547,"We (two 13 yo girls and their Mom) watched this after reading the book for school. We all LOVED the book. While the idea of this was good, the story they told strayed too far from the original story. OK...must you include a balloon??? Jesse James? Really?? And what's with all the buxom women with emphasis on the buxom portions of them? (yes, I know it was made in 1989) There were many important parts of the story that were totally lost. Others were so altered that it was hard to see the original storyline. We did like the section when Aouda was to be burned (no spoiler here). That part was well done. We felt that Phileas Fogg showed too much emotional change too early in the story. We believe in the book he was changing, but much more subtly.

As the only viewer in our group that was alive in the 80's or 90's, I appreciated seeing so many actors of that era. I particularly enjoyed seeing Stephanie Powers and Robert Wagner (a.k.a Jonathan and Jennifer Hart from Hart to Hart) show up together in this miniseries.

In AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS, English adventurer Phileas Fogg wagers fellow Reform Club members that with all the available modern methods of late 19th Century transportation, he'll be able to circumnavigate the globe in barely 11 weeks. Fogg (Niven) and manservant Passepartout (Cantinflas) set off on a memorable journey filled with colorful sites and unusual people.

Popular Mexican actor Cantinflas is really the star of this Oscar-winning super-widescreen, stereophonic Mike Todd travelogue that's based on Jules Verne's novel.

Nifty closing credits by Saul Bass condense a three hour story to a handful of minutes and illustrate what actors cameoed in which scene. Not included during the finale is an ""extras"" list of nearly 1,000 names, longest in motion picture history (see full cast at imdb).

The largest-ever Hollywood production set other staggering records: most costumes (74,685), over 4 million air miles logged, 68,894 extras in 13 countries, 8,552 animals used, 140 sets at a half-dozen Hollywood studios, plus in Japan, Hong Kong and England. Most astounding of all: total budget for a 75 day shoot (including Marlene Dietrich's $300K gown) was only $6 million!

But after reading the book and once again wanting to see the characters in living color and animation - I was dropped to the lower depths of disappointment. It's expected that the book vs. the movie/series rarely, if ever, meet on equal terms, but this production had so much added and shoe horned into story already so large, you could cut and trim instead of stuff and bloat. I love Pierce Brosnan, but here he hardly gives me the sense that he is Fogg, as described in the book, he's brash, he yells, he curses, he gesticulates wildly and thereby ruins the whole calm, unperturbed demeanor of the character. With the possible exception of Eric Idle's performance of the servant, every other character (the police inspector, the 'princess' sacrifice) all act and speak as very poor imitations of characters loosely based on other characters hinted at in the book. Characters whom were never mentioned, or hinted at, in the story pop up and confound it more by being throw away characters made to seem important. This wasn't a short story that needed padding, it was full enough and rich enough that not one thing need be added to it to make it more entertaining. It just seemed like an excuse to get a bunch of actors that everyone knows, or has heard about, and do a quick and dirty impersonation of a play.

The title screen actually was very hokey--looked like something from 1989, which it was.  I was totally prepared to dislike it.

Well, it was fun and entertaining.  Being a DVD, I learned when to fast forward credits or opening previews and things like that.  Brosnan does a great job, and it's fun seeing all the tons of cameo parts by famous actors.  DO NOT go into this expecting a 2013-made production.  It's from the 1980s and shows it.  It's corny and occasionally predictable, but it's still enjoyable to watch. Also, we did not have any audio or video problems with it, though some people apparently have.

He brings the character of Philias Fogg to life with a cold manner at first and then slowly softens his character into a kindhearted gentleman. In this movie Princess Auoda and Passepartout are perfectly portrayed, the first as a stunning Indian girl arrayed in her beautiful clothing, and the latter as a bumbling yet reliable French man. Fix never ceases to make a nuisance of himself throughout the movie but the movie would be incomplete without him and somehow you come to like his character enough to accept his aggravating manner. As to the scenes themselves, they are well made. Though I can't vouch for what they would have looked like in that time period, I would say they are right on the money whether it be in the dark cave of their captors or in the crowded and noisy streets of Hong Kong.

As reported by others, this DVD authoring is poor, having a yellowish cast and artifacts indicating that the videotape used was worn or damaged.

This script emphasizes more of the comedy and romance contained in the story.  I personally find that the Detective Fix character and the Reform Club gets more airtime than is needed, but this may make more sense when viewed in mini-series format.  The introduction of contemporary historic figure cameos only slows things down.

722363,4,6303890547,"So how do you take a relatively short novel and turn it into a nearly 4  hour miniseries? Answer: A whole lot of padding. At least half the material in the movie is not in the book including the balloon ride which was taken from the 1956 film with David Niven. Besides all the added parts the mini series is actually pretty true to the Jules Verne book. It also sports one of the most amazing casts you'll ever see. As a big James Bond fan I was absolutely thrilled to see Pierce Brosnan, Christopher Lee and Patrick Macnee all sitting around a table together. Eric Idle is excellent as Frenchman Jean Passepartout and Peter Ustinov give an...uh... interesting performance as Detective Fix. Julia Nickson was not a name I was familiar with but she did a fine job as Princess Aouda. I wasn't a tremendous fan of Brosnan's tenure as Bond (not altogether his fault) but his performance as Phileas Fogg is wonderful and very true to the spirit of the character.

*** SPOILER ALERT ***
Besides the aforementioned balloon flight the movie also added a fairly pointless run in with French actress Sarah Bernhardt, a kidnapping in Burma and an encounter with Jesse James. I didn't really like the Burma part because Fogg and crew were rescued by the British who then slaughtered dozens of Burmese kidnappers. It wasn't gory in the least but the killings seemed badly out of sync with the general lighthearted nature of the film. What I couldn't quite understand was the removal of some parts of the book. In the book Passepartout is taken against his will by a group of American Indians and Fogg risks his life to save his trusted valet. This seemed like a rather pivotal moment in the story and its removal is a bit of an odd decision given that they certainly had enough film length to include it. Also, at one point in the book Detective Fix reveals to Passepartout that he plans to arrest Fogg but has decided to assist him in his quest if only to get him back in England so he can carry out his warrant. Passepartout decides against informing Fogg to his regret when Fix follows through and does indeed arrest Fogg the moment he steps foot in Britain. Again, I considered this an important part of the book which probably shouldn't have been removed.

The film clearly has all the hallmarks of a made for TV movie from the late 80's but the cast, of which I have only named some luminaries, is worth the 4  hours of your life. As on homage to the Verne book it's probably the most faithful adaptation I have ever seen and they really put some effort into the set designs. I watched this on Netflix and I can't say that I'd actually pay money to own it but I did enjoy the movie and recommend it.",1309392000,4,2692,4.465447154471545

Of the three, Jackie Chan's is the most enjoyable. It's light-hearted, full of laughs and action and it moves right along. The Niven version is so incredibly heavy and pondering it's amazing it hasn't sunk into oblivion. The best thing about it is the star-searching. That leaves this patchwork quilt with Pierce Prosnan and Eric Idle.

This was a three-part miniseries, and boy, does it show! It's terribly fragnented with obvious commercial breaks every 15 minutes or so. As a result, no head of steam can be built up. The transfer quality sucks, too. But the major question is this: Why did they bother? Why spend the money they obviously spent to do a remake that doesn't improve on the Niven version? Just so Pierce Brosnan could have something to do while waiting for James Bond? And why hire an English comic to play a Frenchman? Peter Ustinov (criticized elsewhere for his over-the-top hamminess in this) saves the day...he and the wonderful old character actors at The Refom Club and the Bank of England.

The cast is wonderful, including notably Eric Idle and Peter Ustinov. As one of the last of the great '80s all-star miniseries, this one competes for a place as the best. It's family-friendly, too, with plenty to delight all ages.

For those who've seen the edited DVD from which portions of the miniseries were cut, I have good news: This edition from Trinity actually has the whole thing. Nothing's missing here, with the full running time of 266 minutes. (And for those who didn't know, yes, it really is 266 minutes. The original miniseries was presented in 3 parts--not 2--of 2 hours each, including commercials.) I was fortunate enough to discover this version first. And best of all, it costs a lot less.

The bad news is that this is a transfer from video, and as we all know about video, it doesn't always survive a decade and a half well. In just a few places there are minor video glitches. However, they're brief and they aren't anywhere near bad enough to distract from the film. As such they're quite forgiveable in light of that fact that this brilliant miniseries is complete and finally available on DVD.",1117497600,89,1384,4.691358024691358
722587,4,6303890547,"I would give this pitifully under-rated film five stars, however, there are some problems with the 2 DVD set....

This is a good quality transfer, but there are 2 flaws in this version....

Some scenes from the VHS set are missing.... but the absolute worst thing is that every 15 or 20 minutes, we have to see the opening logo once OR TWICE, then also see ""previews of the next episodes"" and so forth, which worked well on commercial television, but absolutely have no place on a DVD. The VHS version simply had the entire miniseries as a continual film... this is how the DVD should have been replicated... with the missing scenes restored.",1106352000,43,642,4.62280701754386
722588,4,6303890547,"I read the book for the first itme when I was eight at the request of my Uncle.  And then I saw the movie when it came out two years later.  I loved both immensely.  Both have that sense of grand adventure and daring-do that I enjoy.  And the movie has the added incentive of having Pierce Brosnan as the lead character, Phineas Fogg.  I have admired him since I used to watch the Remington Steele series on TV.  He has a casual elegance about his ability to play the rather strict business-like individuals is something he does better than any other major movie star.  For reference check out his performances in Taipan, The Thomas Crowne Affair, The Lawnmower Man, and any of the Bond movies.",1098748800,2,694,4.4603174603174605
722589,2,6303890547,"I watched the same film in VHS few years ago.
It was very impressive and had a lot of fun.
But after I got this DVD, it really disappointed me!!
A lot of scenes have been REMOVED: just like the chapter in China, Japan and India. And that part(saving the princess) has gone also.
If this is a miniseries, I guess they really didn`t have an idea about when and where to cut it!!!",1088985600,10,377,4.108108108108108

I divided it up into two evenings. This is one movie you can watch with your grandmother or with children around  and not be embarrassed. I think it's a great family movie. And the picture was fine. I used to have the  VHS copy and this DVD was much better quality.",1084838400,5,511,4.1

722645,5,6303890547,"I saw this movie last summer on tv. When I started watching it I had no idea that it was as long as it is, otherwise I probably wouldn't have watched it, what would have been a mistake. Then this movie is wonderful. The only reason I can see that some people might not like it is, that it doesn't use all this high technology, full of action and sex scenes that we are used to now a days, when watching a movie. For me it is a welcome change and I enjoyed it, but everyone has their own opinion and is entitled to it.
Another thing I like about this movie is all the build in obstacles Pierce Brosnan has to go through on his quest. Often, it seems to me, that once he got out of one problem, he faces another one, what creates suspence on whether he will reach his goal or not. Also I highly appreciate the differente cultures portrayed in it.",1065916800,5,844,4.090361445783133

722648,3,6303890547,"This made for TV movie is broad in scoop.  Brosnan takes off to win a bet by traveling around the world in 80 days.  He is met with challenges at every front and pursued by a dogged PI.  Oddly enough he also keeps running into the famous of the era.
Brosnan acted with energy and enthusiasm.  I liked this a lot, but I bought it as a good ""G rated"" family movie, but the kids all walked out on it.  It was to long and to uninteresting for them.",1055894400,,444,3.943820224719101
722649,5,6303890547,"Even though I am a big Pierce Brosnan fan, I only watched the mini-series just to see what Eric Idle looks like. He is so cute, adorable, witty, funny, and was the soul in the mini-series. That when I got my interest in him and how I watched Monty Python. While John Cleese put the straight man act, Graham Chapman put the one-line words, Terry Gilliam put the animation, Terry Jones dressing in drag was fun, & Michael Palin acted like the stupid man, Eric put the sex in Monty Python. I wished the producers of that mini-series would give a spin-off of Passepartout and let him go around in his journeys maybe with his kid or two and let him be either devorced or widowed. If I can get an internet site and write fan fiction, It would only be Eric's Passepartout and Passepartout only!! Pierce may be Bond and Peter Ustinov may be the brains and better actor but Eric is the comic relief and had Pierce show more emotion with his cold-fish character into a warm sensitive person. Everybody thought it was the Indian princess that moved Pierce but Eric' Jean Passepartout played a very big role in it and even though Phileas took the credit for the journey, Passepartout is the one who steals the mini-series and is the one also that deserves about 95% of the applause.",1046995200,2,1270,4.478448275862069

7854216,2,6303890547,"This mini-series has a great cast and is quite enjoyable. The acting is everywhere from competent to very good, and you'll enjoy the many famous faces.

Unfortunately the video obviously came straight from tape .. and OLD tape. The picture is fuzzy most of the time, grainy all of the time, and occasionally you see double images around the outline of actors and objects in the background.

The colors are considerably off from its original broadcast.

Most annoying is the soundtrack. The dialog is OK, but the background music is almost without exception a victim of the type of distortion that comes from old tape.

I literally have better vidoes that I taped from TV, and then dubbed from VHS tapes to DVD as much as 15 yeasrs later.

The bad news is that this appears to currently be the only way to get this complete mini series, and if you can travel back in time 20 years and pretend that you taped this while you were away with a bad VCR on a cheap VHS tape, you won't mind it too much. LOL

When you compare this to DVDs of the Remington Steele show (also with Brosnan) that was produced a few years earlier than this, you'll see that no effort at all went into the transfer, and evidently no effort went into the search for a better source master.",1508976000,9,1258,4.424242424242424

The casting and locations were well-done, especially considering that this was a TV movie, not one released in theaters. I highly recommend it. In my opinion it stands the test of time.

A man most set in his ways is changed by his 80 day journey and finds he can care about people, make friends and fall in love along the way. In the end he realizes his life had been a waste and lonely and decides he wants much more. Pierce B. portrayal as this unique character is delightful. Enjoyed the surprising twist.
