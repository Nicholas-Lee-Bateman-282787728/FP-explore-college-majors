7930684,5,B00005420T,"This movie inspired me to help other children with similar disorders like my grandson.  My family used the very difficult and challenging methods to calm a violent child to eventually reach some of the deep problems.  My 6 year old grandson showed some, but not all, of ""Katherines'""  violent tendancies.  We have yet to find a physician/pychiatrist as the doctor in this movie.  But we will keep trying.  So far my daughter has found that there has been slight improvements in my grandson with the techniques used in the movie.  I would appreciate it if Lifetime TV would air this movie again in the near future.
