8681488,5,B00O1Y5E7A,"I was surprised to see more technically-knowledgeable reviewers comment on what was thought to be a less than perfect Blu-ray recording.  Watching it, I marveled at the audio and video quality of the picture in both performances.  Lest you think the 480i upconverted to 1080i is a flaw or distraction, I can assure you that the picture is sparkling, clear, and vibrant.  In many of the close-ups, you can see each individual hair on a musician's head.  (I almost felt I was intruding, to be able to see them so closely!)

For both symphony 1 and 2 the performances are excellent--the musicians are attentive to each of Jrvi's directions, his guidance is constant and we watching the video can see subtle indications to the orchestra which the symphony hall audience cannot.

Both Swedish soprano Camilla Tilling and Finnish mezzo Lilli Paasikivi are in perfect form and seem to feel the passion which I especially find moving in the Urlicht and final parts of Symphony 2.

There is a bonus feature of Paavo Jrvi's thoughts about the two symphonies.  I don't entirely agree that Mahler was constantly tormented by his Jewish roots, (he was able to fit himself into the world he chose to live in!) but surely they did influence his life and his music.  Many of us, as did Leonard Bernstein, hear bits of klezmer music especially in the middle sections of Symphony 1.  At any rate, Jrvi's comments are generally insightful, and promote continued thought and discussion.

The technical engineers deserve special praise, not only for the quality--audio and video--of the DVD, but also for knowing the music, and being able to be there every time an individual instrument was given by Mahler its ""chance to shine.""  Really, it was a ""symphony of the engineers"" to engineer being there for so many close-ups at exactly the right moment.

Symphony 2 was performed in the Eberbach Monastery whose alcove served as a perfect location for the off-stage brass ensemble, and gave it an aura of supernatural distance (which I think is just what Mahler intended)

There have been so many great conductors of Mahler, that I was a bit hesitant to welcome Paavo Jrvi into their midst, but this recording convinces me he is for real, and I think you'll find hearing and watching these two symphonies a really enjoyable experience.",1456876800,3,2311,4.862244897959184
8681489,5,B00O1Y5E7A,"This DVD on the C Major label features the Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Paavo Jarvi performing Mahlers Symphony No. 1 Titan and Symphony No. 2 Resurrection.  And my goodness, is it frighteningly clear that Mr. Jarvi understands the score and the intent behind it.  This is freakishly well done, and these two gripping performances were a delight for this Mahler lover.

The two Symphonies are performed in order, and the first (Titan) certainly lives up to its nickname the way it is performed here.  This is music making of the highest order, and it is clear from the very first note that the orchestra cares as much about bringing this music to life as the conductor does  and the full dynamic range of the Blu-Ray medium is utilized, as every important nuance is produced and captured.  The 3rd movement is particularly captivating here (just as it is live  unbelievable what Mahler does with the material herein), and this orchestra and Mr. Jarvi bring forth every subtle emotional texture.  I cant say enough about how captivating this entire performance is.

And what about Symphony No. 2 (Ressurection), featuring Camilla Tilling (soprano) and Lilli Paasikivi (mezzo-soprano)?  It brings back chilling memories from when I heard an amazing departing conductor for the Phoenix Symphony perform the work as his last concert before returning to his homeland due to what ended up being a terminal health condition.  This work has *everything* contained within it  thoughts about life and death and suffering and striving  amazing choral work, stunning solo sections that show what a talented orchestra can do when they are completely committed to the music and the vision of the composer as interpreted by a talented conductor that knows and feels the intent of the composer.  Words are insufficient to convey the emotional subtext of the listening experience captured here.  This is glorious and unbelievable, and it brought tears to the eyes of this listeneras I remember seeing a man give everything he had to give as he conducted this piece, as his musicians give everything they could back to him that they possibly could.
It is rare to see an orchestra and conductor that are in sync to this degree, and that feel this deep of a connection to the music being performed.  The liner notes are a bit sparse, but the music says everything that needs to be said.  If you adore the work of Mahler as I do, or are open to experiencing what this genius has put to paper for other great men to interpret, then you need to see this DVD (preferably in Blu-Ray).  Very Highly Recommended.",1451779200,,2604,4.879545454545455
8681490,5,B00O1Y5E7A,"Theres a lot happening on this new Blu Ray disc of the first two Mahler symphonies with the Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Paavo Jarvi. There is a very fine 1st Symphony recorded at the Kurhaus Wiesbaden in 2012, and an outstanding 2nd Symphony from Kloster Eberbach filmed in 2010. Though the 2nd Symphony loses something because of the lower definition of its video source, it still packs a real punch. Both contain orchestral playing of the highest order, with outstanding solo and choral contributions in no. 2.

The set includes a fascinating discussion by conductor Paavo Jarvi of the Resurrection Symphony which contains a blunt repudiation of any sincere belief by Mahler in Christian doctrine: Its not him. You can feel it in the music. Jarvi finds the music beautiful, but feels there is an emotional distance built in because of Mahlers equivocating embrace of Catholicism. You can feel that distance in this performance, as beautifully played and sung as it is. I find these views absolutely clear-sighted, and the performance completely convincing. This was written, after all, at the end of the 19th century; Mahlers world is not Bachs. Your mileage may vary :)

Jarvi feels that Kloster Eberbach is the perfect place for a performance of the 2nd Symphony. Besides the visual and historical aspect of Romanesque Abbey Church, built in the 12th century, the acoustic space is hugely reverberant, with an 8 second echo. But Jarvi doesnt worry about this harming the music: Absolute precision seems much less important.. He feels that the way that sounds overlap suits the mix of orchestra, offstage instruments and chorus, with an amazing meeting point somewhere in the space. Im not sure how it happens, but this 2nd Symphony is magic.",1426982400,,1765,5.041095890410959
8681491,4,B00O1Y5E7A,"A true bargain with both Symphonies 1&2, sonically awesome, performances wonderful, the only reason for the 4 star rating instead of 5 is the video quality on the second symphony is sub par, soft, lacking in detail, not up to Blu-ray standards.",1426809600,,244,4.833333333333333
8681492,5,B00O1Y5E7A,"The Estonian/American conductor Paavo Jarvi (one son of the world-famous conductor Neeme Jarvi) is rapidly making a name for himself as an interpreter of the symphonies of Gustav Mahler. This new 2-disc DVD from Unitel Classica features Symphonies 1 and 2 [filmed in high definition (HD)], and both DVDs make a point of stating ""The Mahler Symphonies,"" which implies that he intends to conduct the complete cycle. The first Symphony was recorded in the Kurhaus Wiesbaden on August 23, 2012. Those with computers can view this performance (as of February 8, 2015) on the web with a separate URL for each movement. The second Symphony was recorded in Eberbach Abbey (Kloster Eberbach) on June 26 and 27, 2010. Only the finale (fifth movement) of this performance is available (as of February 8, 2015) on the web, and the video looks totally ""washed out,"" which largely negates the whole point of HD.
Overall I rate Paavo Jarvi's interpretations as excellent. He is especially sensitive in the second Symphony to the acoustics of Eberbach Abbey, which has a long reverberation time. A good example of this is the opening timpani phrase at the start of the third movement; Jarvi paces it beautifully so that nothing is lost. The Swedish soprano Camilla Tilling and the Finnish mezzo-soprano Lilli Paasikivi both sing superbly, and the enjoyment of both symphonies is greatly enhanced by the all-too-infrequently unsung heroes of all excellent video films - the camera crew members, who clearly know the compositions well.
My only criticism of this 2-disc set is that the program notes are much too brief. Major productions like this absolutely demand more comprehensive notes to inform viewers about these symphonies. Viewers who know little about these works will learn very little from the single page of text enclosed. Please, Unitel, provide much more comprehensive notes for future DVDs of classical compositions, especially the symphonies of Mahler!
Conclusion: inadequate program notes spoil an otherwise excellent production. If this doesn't bother you and you're a Mahler-lover, buy the set!

8681493,4,B00O1Y5E7A,"Recieved my pre-order of this BluRay disc today.
 I will not comment about the artistic performance of the music. I am not qualified.
 However, there is a major problem,and I work in the broadcast television business,so I think I can comment on this disc. For whatever reason,Symphony No. 1 is true 1080i video. Symphony No. 2 is video from what looks like an 480i master,upconverted to 1080i.
 Yes,you can present a HD 1080i BluRay,but the original recording can be a less than true HD quality.
 I think this could be a mistake from Unitel Classical that produced this disc. If not a mistake,intentional,and that""s sad. It's known as fraud.
 I hope to hear from other buyers concerning this quality issue of the BluRay disc. Maybe I'm wrong",1422316800,8,741,4.803149606299213
