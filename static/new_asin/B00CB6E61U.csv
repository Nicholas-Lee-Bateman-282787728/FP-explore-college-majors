5711022,5,B00CB6E61U,The Doc was amazing!  I really felt like I was apart of the crew traveling around and listening to the amazing interviews.  This is what Star Wars fans are about!  A must for a fan or someone who wants to learn more about the Star Wars universe.,1385337600,,245,4.170212765957447
5711023,5,B00CB6E61U,"I finally had time to sit down and watch The Force Within Us. As with Cris Macht's previous film, The Force Among Us, Cris and his team have put together an amazing and powerful ""love letter"" to Star Wars fans. This time the journey is much more personal and internal, and shows how potent the medium of film is, and how Star Wars has and continues to touch the lives of so many people around the world. I'm proud to call myself a Star Wars fan, and may the Force live within us all for many decades to come.",1369008000,,508,4.141414141414141
5711024,5,B00CB6E61U,"After watching the first movie by Cris, The Force Among Us, I was stoked to hear he was making a second film. This is Cris' journey as a Star Wars fan, and I feel like I know him personally by watching this film. He really gets in touch with Star Wars fandom and shows how much Star Wars fans are really just like anyone else. We have a passion and a dedication that gives life meaning and brings us hope in this very uncertain world. I was touched by this film and recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about Geek/Genre fandom.

This movie was so good I paid twice for one copy!",1368230400,,592,4.192982456140351
5711025,5,B00CB6E61U,"The Force Within Us is a great Star Wars Fan Documentary and well made. Cris Macht did a really directing the film and telling the story of Star Wars Fans and fandom in general. All the people in interviwed the documentary Cris Macht , Ashley Eckstein , Dave Dorman , Jimmy Mac from RebelForce Radio , Paul Bateman , Steve Sansweet etc are awesome. This Documentary is a must own for Star Wars fans and a must see. Star Wars is forever and so is The Force Within Us.",1367971200,,466,4.247191011235955
5711026,5,B00CB6E61U,"Overall I liked the film and I thought it had some great moments, including the following: I enjoyed hearing from Jimmy Mac and his family. I laughed as I watched his wife, Wendy, take him to task on how his two sons have to share a room because of his Star Wars room. I enjoyed that, because that would be a similar conversation me and my wife would have. I enjoyed the Dave Dorman interview and his perspective as a licensed Lucasfilm artist.

The most enjoyable parts of the film were the interviews with the residents of Crescent City, CA and their memories of when Lucasfilm rolled into town to film the Endor scenes for Return of the Jedi. It was great to hear the stories of people who played a part in the film and have such fond memories of it all. I also like the on location segment, when the crew was at Death Valley visiting some memorable locations from the movies.

Perhaps my only criticism is that there were too many interviews with fans, which we got a lot of in the first film -The Force Among Us (which is awesome too, by the way.). I felt that there were too many of these and that after awhile I was hearing the same thing over and over again, just from different people. I liked the fan interviews, I just felt it was overdone.

Overall, I enjoyed this film and I think Cris and his crew did a great job on this. I'm glad I was able to help out, (even just a little) along with a bunch of other Star Wars fans, to get this film produced and released via the Kickstarter project. Thank You Cris Macht for your dedication and passion for Star Wars. I can't wait for The Force Around Us!",1367193600,,1608,4.248366013071895
5711027,5,B00CB6E61U,"While there have been many Star Wars fan documentaries over the years, some very good ones and some fairly below average ones, I was excited to watch this the second it arrived.  Having backed the project on Kickstarter, I was following it from day one, and when it finally arrived, I, strangely, even felt more excitement than I did when the actual six films came out on Blu-ray.  It is clear from the beginning to the end that this was a work of passion from a person who not only loves Star Wars but loves what Star Wars has done for him, his family, his friends, and, indeed, the world.  The biggest issue that I have with any documentary is that of editing and how many times the director/editor does not know how to cut something up, make it move along, and you are watching a talking head recalling a story for 10 or 15 minutes.  While I truly believe ALL of these stories are interesting, it is important to always remember that it is still a movie that needs to move along, and it is not forgotten here.  The interviews make up most of the film, and I never once found myself bored or wanting someone else to come up on screen.  I know there would most likely be hours of footage for each person, but the actual portions picked to be in the film are masterfully done and never drag.  It is also incredible to see a handful of filming locations, especially at the end when we find ourselves in the woods of California, aka Endor, and we have some great interviews with cast and crew from the film.

To say the movie is heartfelt would also be an understatement.  Cris Macht, the creator of this documentary, gives us an extremely personal look at what Star Wars meant to the life of him and his family, and while much goes unsaid, I do feel there is more there than appears.  For many people, myself to some extent, we have had much pain in our lives and during that time, it's incredible what can help bring us out of it.  Often times, the best way to bring us back to the real world is a world far, far away.

If you consider yourself a fan of Star Wars, this is an absolute must own.  If you are a fan of documentaries and maybe not Star Wars in general, this is still a must own as while the thing that draws the film together is Star Wars, it is not ABOUT Star Wars as much as what Star Wars does to and for people.  Top quality from beginning to end.",1367193600,,2364,4.224444444444444
5711028,5,B00CB6E61U,"I have an entire shelf of Star Wars dvds....the films, animated series, Lego specials, plus all of the fan documentaries.  Star Woids, Star Wait, Jedi Junkies...you name it I have it.  Cris Macht's duology which includes his first film, ""The Force Among Us"" and this new film, ""The Force Within Us"" is lightyears beyond the other fan docs.  Both of Cris' films have loads of nostalgia, if that's what you're after.  They also feature incredible footage of the locations in Tunisia, Norway, Death Valley, and Northern California that belong on the official Star Wars boxed sets.  Cris' films have loads of heart and passion and never poke fun at Star Wars fans like the other fan documentaries seem to.  This is no Trekkies, but a love letter not just to Star Wars, but to Star Wars fans.  I can't wait for the third film to be released, and whole-heartedly recommend people check out both ""The Force Among Us"" Director's Cut when it's released, and ""The Force Within Us.""

5711029,5,B00CB6E61U,"I have watched this film 4 times since I recieved it. GREAT JOB CRIS!!!! It is the quintessential Star Wars fans documentary, I have ever watched. This film will relate to not just Star Wars fans, but everyone. It brought out so many emotions and memories of my childhood. 10 out 10!!!",1366934400,,285,4.5
5711030,5,B00CB6E61U,"This movie captures everything that it means to be a Star Wars fan.  But more than that, it follows a specific story weaving through filmmaker Chris Macht's life.  Wonderfully made and a superb soundtrack!",1366934400,,205,5.0
5711031,5,B00CB6E61U,"This film is a total MUST for not only lovers of the iconic STAR WARS series but for everyone!
The makers have crafted a fantastic documentary where their love of the subject shines through!
It takes you on an emotional journey from one mans loss to rediscovering his childhood through these
amazing films!.
I can't recommend this enough get it while you can!
Congratulations to Cris and everyone involved!",1366761600,,406,4.898550724637682
5711032,5,B00CB6E61U,"""The Force Among Us"", Cris Macht's first documentary about the fans and fandom of Star Wars was an amazing accomplishment.  I've enjoyed watching it over and over.  But this ""sequel documentary"" blows it away!  ""The Force Among Us"" gave us a general feel of Star Wars fandom, while ""The Force Within Us"" digs into the heart of the matter.  That's what this film is about: HEART.  While ""The Force Within Us"" is largely Cris's story of connecting to his family (especially his dad) and his youth through the medium of Star Wars, it is coupled with others' stories of similar situations: fathers with their children, friends connecting with each other, families meeting each other through their fandom.

Star Wars came about because of one man's understanding that our culture needed hope during a dark time -- a modern mythology that appealed to the heart and soul of every person.  ""The Force Within Us"" chronicles the success of this saga through the eyes and lives of people who shared and continue to share the power of the Force that surrounds us, penetrates us, and binds the galaxy together.",1366675200,,1097,4.834224598930481
5711033,5,B00CB6E61U,"I very much enjoyed this film.  I have tried to watch  as many Star Wars documentaries as possible and some are great, while others seem to lack something.  This one knocked it out of the park!  I enjoyed the celebrity interviews, but the real gems (for me at least) were the candid moments of fans sharing their love and collections with their families.  It was like peeking into my home from the outside.  I have two sons and the saga is definitely a part of the glue that our bonds are made from. We adopted our oldest son, Mario, when he was just eight years old and I honestly think that collecting and playing with the toys with him started us off on the loving relationship we now enjoy.  We missed the first film (The Force Among Us), but my boys and I are already eagerly anticipating the release of the director's cut.  Thanks guys!",1366416000,,842,4.387096774193548
5711034,5,B00CB6E61U,"This wonderful dvd follows the acclaimed dvd The Force Among Us and takes the viewer on a fantastic ride down the childhood roads of Cris Macht and includes wonderful feelings and feedback from Star Wars fans and movie  personnel. It is touching, heartfelt and full of the Force!  I recommend this dvd to everyone who has a love of Star Wars, no matter your age!",1366329600,,362,4.553846153846154
5711035,5,B00CB6E61U,"When I had first decided to purchase The Force Within Us, I was at the time, just adding another Star Wars documentary to my Video library. After watching it, I had come to realise that this film isn't just another Star Wars documentary: its so much more.  The Force Within Us is, pure and simply, a film about how Star Wars has formed connections for us all.  Star Wars is the glue that holds together our pasts, presents and futures.

Cris Macht, as well as all the other interviewees, opens their hearts and souls to shares with us varying stories, all familiar, of what Star Wars means to them and what it means to us all.  He makes it perfectly plain that Star Wars is that common bond that surrounds us and binds us all together.

Star Wars forms connections between us all: family and friends, loves and lovers, husbands and wives. It is the glue that keeps us together and is the catalyst that sparks the fondest of memories. Star Wars is something shared not only with those we love, but is the strongest of bonds between who we are today and our younger selves of yesteryear.  It is a film that opens the books of our minds to those tender memories of our childhoods, when life was as perfect as you could get.

This film states so beautifully just how important those memories are that we hold so dear as well as the interactions we have with other Star Wars fans, both familiar and unfamiliar.

Hearing the stories from some of  today's most well known Star Wars icons such as Cris, Ashley Eckstein (voice of Ahsoka Tano/founder of Her Universe), Dave Dorman (Artist), Steve Sansweet (Rancho Obi-Wan) and Jimmy ""Mac"" McInerney (co-host of Rebel Force Radio) as well as the icons of the Original Trilogy such as Jeremy Bulloch (Boba Fett) and the impact that Star Wars had on them, shows us how we are all equal as fans and that it means something to all of us in our own way.

This film reminds me of my own connections I have because of Star Wars. It takes me back to when I was a kid and my dad took me to see it for the first time in 1977 all the way to the present day when I took my father to Rancho Obi-Wan for his birthday. We will always share our love for Star Wars.

The Force Within Us lets me know that I am not the only one who's life has been enriched by Star Wars and reminds me of all those special memories I have made from my childhood to now and will continue to make in the future.",1366329600,,2413,4.281318681318681
5711036,5,B00CB6E61U,"This is the first time I've posted anything on Amazon, but I felt that this film certainly warranted it.  I'm an ""on-off"" Star Wars fan and ordered this film the other day, and watched it last night.  It is a touching film about the ""Fans"" of Star Wars and why they are fans.  I have to say that the production values and the film maker's LOVE of Star Wars really make the film!  It even helped answer a few of my questions on why I like Star Wars as well!  Major thumbs up for this one!",1366243200,3,487,4.03125
5711037,5,B00CB6E61U,"This was such a great movie.  It truly captures the heart of fandom and why people are fans.  If you are a fan of anything, even if it is not Star Wars, or know someone who is, this movie is for you.  Chris does an amazing job of answering the question ""What makes a fan a fan?"".

5711038,5,B00CB6E61U,"I just finished watching the ""The Force Within Us"" with my family, and I have to say a huge congratulations to Cris and Ian for doing an incredible job on the film. For one thing, it looks better and flows better than the original, but more importantly, it has a more compelling narrative and tells a more connective story. Not just about Cris and his own family, but how the saga has brought so many people closer together with their own families, their children, and the Star Wars community as a whole. There were genuine moments of emotion, tears, and chills. I am very proud that my band High Adventure was able to record music for the soundtrack and it was a thrill to see the moments in which the music helped to better tell the story. An excellent job overall, and perhaps the best Star Wars indie film on the market today. Looking forward to the next film in the trilogy!",1366156800,5,879,4.432098765432099
5711039,5,B00CB6E61U,Best Star Wars documentary I have ever watched this film truly relates to all Star Wars fans. 10 out 10 for the film,1366070400,3,116,4.086956521739131
5711040,5,B00CB6E61U,"This movie is a heartfelt testimony on how Star Wars has touched peoples lives with very specific examples from the film maker and others that are passionate about Star Wars including those who has parts in creating Star Wars like Ashley Eckstein, Dave Dorman, Robert Watts and Jimmy Mac of Rebel Force radio to name just a few. It also gives personal stories of those who were a part of Return of the Jedi in northern California both in front and behind the camera. Also there is a lot of footage that goes back to the early years of the 1970s and 1980s. Whether you are a Star Wars fan now or in the past or never were a fan you will be touched by the stories in this movie. Highly recommended.",1366070400,4,696,4.28030303030303
5711041,5,B00CB6E61U,"This documentary is amazing. Not only does this film take viewers on an incredible journey through Star Wars history and locations, it is also a look into film maker Cris Macht and a few others who share their passions for Star Wars. It is a very personal story, one that so many of us fans can relate to. This is a must have for fans of all ranges, from the passionate to the casual.

While I loved hearing all the stories from different people I feel these movies truly shine when they become about the filmmaker's personal journey. I've watched them several times now and will watch them again. Strongly recommended for any Star Wars fan!",1474416000,,445,4.717948717948718
8579608,4,B00CB6E61U,"A very nice little film. The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars was the less than ideal production values. It is filled with fun, charming and sentimental moments. Star Wars fans should love this (especially those of us who were around when the original came out in '77).",1474243200,,286,4.519230769230769

8579613,5,B00CB6E61U,"Disclaimer: I have met Chris Macht and had a few beer with him, but this review has nothing to do with that.

Star Wars is a cultural phenomenon that has created generations of dedicate, loving and light saber wielding fans. No other film franchise has succeeded in the same way. But why? If I knew the answer, I'd be making the next movie sensation. In my mind the answer is a mystery that can only be unraveled bit by bit. This movie is one of those bits. It explores some the people and stories behind Star Wars, while also exploring the effects it had on Chris Macht's own life. Be prepared to be moved, to laugh and to understand just a little more why Star Wars remains the most successful franchise in movie history.",1390176000,,723,4.395522388059701
