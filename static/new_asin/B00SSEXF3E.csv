8699124,3,B00SSEXF3E,"A not half bad traditional styled Western about a man about to be hung but set loose only to be hunted by a rich gamesman for the sport of it.

Yes, it the old classic scenario, set in the mountains and forest of the old West.  It's a low budget affair, but they make good use of interesting camera angles and pretty good editing and scenery.  The hero while trying to save his family is thrown in jail to be hung after killing a baddie.  A rich old hunter and his martial artist lacky set him loose to be hunted.

The acting can be a bit stiff, and some of the forest chase scenes repetitive, but over all it puts together a decent action flick with even a martial arts fighting scene. The hero does meets a single woman, who helps him, while out in the woods, so there's a touch of romance suggested.  Overall, it's a clean flick, really no language, sex, only a very, very brief bathing shot of nudity, and the violence is not overly gratuitious or bloody.  At the start of the film, there is child endangerment.  Probably rated PG-13.
