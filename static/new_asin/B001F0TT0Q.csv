8300232,2,B001F0TT0Q,"Eyewitness has a lot of material out there and this dvd seemed to have promise.  It is mostly geared to the late elementary level, but is evolutionary in slant and at one point shows girls running down the beach in thongs - definitely not for the elementary age and I wouldn't show this to even high schoolers - seriously not appropriate for a dvd that is trying to be educational and go through the body systems.",1360022400,,413,4.434210526315789
8300233,3,B001F0TT0Q,"This is an ok video, the animated guy who is seen throughout the video is a little scary/awkward.  The worst part is was the beach scene, when they talk about protection from the sun.  There are girls walking on the beach and their bikini bottoms are not in place...you see a lot of butt!  Yes, this may be seen at the beach, however, I'm not interested in showing my young students girls butts at the beach.  I wanted a good video on the human body, and this is not the best.  I would not buy it again.  however, I may be able to use it again, and just skip the butt scene.",1299456000,8,574,4.080357142857143
