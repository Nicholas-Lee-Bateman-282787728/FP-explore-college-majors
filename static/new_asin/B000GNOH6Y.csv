2615689,3,B000GNOH6Y,This dvd is good for beginners.  A little slow for me.  I need a much faster pace total body workout,1273363200,5,100,3.95
2615690,5,B000GNOH6Y,"This is the funnest workout for me. I absolutely treasure that it's only 30 minutes long and it gives you such a great, great session. I wear a heart monitor when I train and every time I use his DVD, I always burn 250-300 calories... sometimes a little more depending on the weights I select. It's exciting to state this because the exercise routine is SO EASY that it makes it FUN!! I've performed Jillian's 20 minute workout and burned that same amount of calories as Jeffery's--but it wasn't as enjoyable.

He has 3 levels on it (beginner, intermediate and advanced), so it's for everyone. I also ended up buying another one for my mum because even she can do his exercises--now there are no more excuses!",1260662400,3,709,4.582677165354331
2615691,5,B000GNOH6Y,"This dvd has given me a new perspective on what muscles you don't use every day and by doing this exercise several times a week, will help your mind power,self confidence and your body become a new you over time.",1248048000,3,212,4.325
2615692,4,B000GNOH6Y,"What I like about this weight training workout is the emphasis on compound movements and balance-related exercises. The prevailing opinion in the workout world is that these types of exercises help one get the most out of their weight training by raising the heart rate and working out smaller muscles essential to balance and coordination that are often overlooked. Jeffrey Scott constantly coaches through the whole workout and his manner is upbeat but not annoying. He is backed up by two ladies that perform the exercises at two different and easier levels of difficulty. As with the other DVDs in the Trainers Edge series, this workout is well produced and the background and music are simple and not obtrusive. Two sets of dumbbells are used throughout which may be sufficient for the ladies but most guys could probably get more out of the workout by including a third set of dumbbells. The workout starts with a warmup set of easy lunges and squats. The standing workout segment that follows then incorporates more lunges and squats. All this leg work does get the heart rate up and working these these large muscles has been shown by studies to be one of the most effective ways to burn calories. The upper body workout is not overly strenuous but involves a large number of reps in two sets for each arm which seems to be the standard in the female-focused workout DVD world. This is one of the DVD's exercises where a heavier set of dumbbells and fewer reps maybe more productive and less monotonous for most guys. The advanced level of balancing on one leg on many of the exercises additionally works the legs. The floor work that follows involves pushups, chest and tricep work before finishing up with the abs and moving on to a short cool down stretch segment. Again these exercises incorporate some compound movements and balance work. The ab work uses the weights and again is not overly strenuous. The workout then ends with a stretch segment. I approach this DVD as a middle-aged guy who has worked out with weights on and off for my adult life and am always looking to shake up and improve my home workout routine. So my criticism of this dvd is the same issue that I have with most exercise dvds and that is that it is more of an introduction that doesn't fully replace the structure and diversity provided by a class or a trainer. Mr. Scott does a good job of hitting arms,legs and abs in a couple different ways but I would have liked to see him return to do a couple more sets of the exercises particularly in the floor segment focusing on the abs and chest.  I wonder how much more it would have cost them to add a second workout with less talk and more sets to be used after one becomes proficient in the exercises and tired of the same chatter. There is certainly room on the DVD as the whole workout comes in at around 40 minutes. A person can certainly use heavier dumbbells to increase difficulty but incorporating a few more sets would have made me really excited about this DVD.",1228089600,9,3010,4.584415584415584
2615693,2,B000GNOH6Y,"This workout is very repetitive with lunges and squats. As someone with bad knees, it would have been nice to know that before purchasing it. The dialogue is a bit cheesey and unprofessional. I did enjoy the floor work. Also, the background setting looks cheap and is therefore distracting.",1189555200,9,290,4.938775510204081
2615694,5,B000GNOH6Y,"I've used many exercise videos and DVDs over the years, and this has to be one of the best strength training ones I've used.  It's easy to follow, and Mr. Scott's manner is friendly and encouraging without being cloying or overly bouncy.  He gives ample safety pointers and reminders to keep breathing.  The music is energizing but still likely to be palatable for many tastes, and the DVD doesn't seem over-produced.  I actually found myself thinking ""It's over already?"" when the workout came to an end.",1182643200,10,505,4.837209302325581
2615695,5,B000GNOH6Y,"This is the best strength training dvd among my 12 training dvds...
I never get tired of watching and doing it.... it is not boring and very stimulating... you will sweat...

I am here to look for his other dvd series but could not find one.. :-(",1182124800,3,246,4.23404255319149
2615696,5,B000GNOH6Y,"I've done this workout a few times since I received it, and I enjoy it more and more each time.

There's a short warmup at the beginning and a short cool-down/stretch at the end of the workout, and you're going to do some serious work in between. You know how a lot of home workout DVD's claim the exercises will work both upper and lower body at the same time? Well, that's EXACTLY what you get here. Think pelvic tilts WITH chest flies while lying on your back, or rows PLUS leg pulses while standing.

The diversity is quite amazing, too: one background exerciser will show the beginner's version, the other one will do the intermediate version and Jeffrey will do the advanced moves. There's a VERY high repetition of each exercise (Jeffrey starts together with the two girls, then he goes back and starts explaining each version, which always takes some time, so that way it doesn't get boring), and the more times you complete the program, the more experienced you're gonna be, so you can do your own version of each exercise from the beginning if you feel like it. If you use heavier sets of weights, you can always make it more challenging.

Even though it's strictly a toning program, if you find your own level, I'm sure you'll end up doing some serious sweating (I know I have).

Altogether, it's great series of exercises, and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a variable and tough workout.",1165795200,42,1413,4.595238095238095
2615697,4,B000GNOH6Y,"This is a nice basic workout done with lighter weights because of the high reps and compound moves.  There is also a good deal of balance work in this workout, which is always nice because balance work is not that easy to find.  Jeffrey leads the workout and there are two background exercisers.  Jeffrey does the most intense moves and the two background exercisers show less intense options.  Jeffrey is friendly and motivating.  This workout is a great addition to my strength training collection.",1164067200,16,500,4.904761904761905

8133683,5,B000GNOH6Y,Great work out.,1447372800,,15,4.333333333333333
8133684,3,B000GNOH6Y,It's just okay.  I watched it a couple of times and haven't returned.  Maybe I can upgrade it in the future.,1422489600,,108,4.095238095238095
8133685,4,B000GNOH6Y,"My lower back was sore at the beginning of this workout, but I actually felt better by the end. I like how multiple parts of the body are used simultaneously for extra burn.  Three different variations of the moves were shown so that people of all fitness levels could benefit.  I found this workout a little boring, and I prefer to use a heavy weight and less reps, but overall this was a good workout.  I used 5 lb and 10 lb weights, but with all those reps, I wished I had a lighter set.  Lots of squats and lunges which my touchy knees didn't appreciate, but I did what I could.  I'd say I gave it a solid 30% effort--which is the nice thing about working out at home, you don't have to worry about people staring if you stop in the middle.  If you are a beginner there are a lot of great moves and technique offered here!",1417564800,,826,4.13125
8133686,5,B000GNOH6Y,Very good training film.  Good combination of exercises that are easy to learn and accomplish.  Money well spent for someone who cannot afford the gym.,1401753600,,151,5.0
8133687,5,B000GNOH6Y,"I really enjoy this workout.  His directions are very easy to follow.  For each move he starts you out with the beginner version, then allows you the chance to do a little more advanced version of it if you want.  I liked the music and the fact that he is smiling and encouraging all the way through it.  If you are pretty advanced with working out, this video might not be challenging enough for you.",1394928000,,401,4.306666666666667
8133688,5,B000GNOH6Y,"First view of the workouts I thought this is going to be boring and easy. ""WRONG"" so I proceeded through the warm-ups getting half way thru and I thought ""AGAIN"". Heart rate @ 120 BPM legs burning. OMG and this is only the warm-ups. Jeffery gives you three levels of intensity, it is not boring and tolerating a little pain it will increase core strength. I always believed I had fairly decent balance during daily activity. ""WRONG AGAIN"" and these workouts proved it. If you are one who desires to strengthen the entire body, increase balance and aerobic endurance this is the DVD you want.",1385596800,5,591,4.6380952380952385
8133689,5,B000GNOH6Y,I first tried this workout on Netflix. I love it. It really whips you into tip top shape fast. I wouldn't suggest it for daily use because it may be too harsh on your body. Definitely follow up with heavy stretching or do yoga the next day.,1344470400,,240,4.127659574468085
8133690,5,B000GNOH6Y,"I ordered this video to see if it would work with Geriatric Patients, and it was everthing i hoped for",1332979200,2,102,4.15
8133691,5,B000GNOH6Y,"I read through the negative reviews and want to comment on it: lunges and squats are part of this workout but in combination with upper body exercises. This causes your heart rate to elevate making it nicely challenging and the most of your workout time. If your knees hurt FROM doing lunges, your form is incorrect. If you have ""bad"" knees, squats and lunges might just strengthen your leg muscles and help your knees. Either way, it is not done exessively in this DVD. The pace is steady, definitely not slow. I used weights as heavy as I could handle (7 to 20 lbs for various exercises - I'm female), plus ankle weights and I was challenged keeping up with the pace (I'm used to Cathe and sweated through the new Bob Harper Inside Out workouts).
He begins each exercise with the basic move then adds on more and more to make it harder. Each exerciser demonstrates at a different level, from beginner to advanced. The workout is chaptered into two main sections: standing and floor which includes abs. Instruction is well done and friendly. In less than 45 minutes you get good total body strength training workout.",1283990400,22,1117,4.646464646464646
