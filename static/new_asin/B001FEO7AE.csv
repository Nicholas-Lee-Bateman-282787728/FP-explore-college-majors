8302036,5,B001FEO7AE,This is an excellent video for personal enjoyment or for sharing with your friends. It radiates the beauty of ballet as a performing art. I bought this video because I view the French ballerinas to be the best in the world.  Their movement is so fluid and graceful. I also purchased this video to share with my students of ballet.  It represents a deeper level of technique and expression for performance.,1263686400,4,405,4.690140845070423

8302038,5,B001FEO7AE,"This was a delightful view of the level of artistry this woman had.  Every nuance, every stance is being conveyed to her students and her criticism is often harsh although necessary to preserve her dance standards.  I could see the students trying very hard to absorb her style, but just a movement from her eclipsed any of their technical abilities.  It is truly inspiring to see great artistry like this and to dream of aspiring to it.",1226448000,10,437,4.64935064935065
