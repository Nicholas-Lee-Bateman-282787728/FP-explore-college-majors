8423036,4,B004CJB0BI,the kind of movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat and won't let you fall asleep for a while.,1389225600,,100,3.590909090909091
8423037,2,B004CJB0BI,"Not an Oscar contender but it was mildly entertaining. A good, ""if you've got  nothing to do and want to kill some time"" this is a good vehicle for you.",1389052800,2,152,4.066666666666666
8423038,2,B004CJB0BI,"Ok, these low budget horror flicks with almost no budget are entertaining in their own way.
However the cover for this one leads one to think of zombies or ""28 days later"" or ""rec'  but it's not.
In fact this is about a group of scientists who are infected by a mutant h1n1 virus and then attacked by a android.
It's pure shlock! lots lots of almost no budget horror movies through the ages that I enjoy so well.
This fits into that scene with it's sets which are basically some sort of wharehouse with designer walls and plastic sheeting even. That's supposed to be the lab. THey have mabybe for stages set up! The android looks like a transvestite sorta and talks with a srrange voice. The basic story though of evil labs allowing a virus to escape so that they can make money from the vaciine is a good idea. IT's just that they had no money at all to make this movie with! If you don't like superlow budget akward movies then stay away from this one. BUt I like them and so found this to be what I expected.  The dvd looks excellent and it's dark because that's how they shot this movie. At least it's on film though!  The acting isn't terrible as one person said , instead these newer actors do the best with what they have and are believable as dying plague victims. However the direction is all over the place like you'd expect.",1306368000,4,1335,4.3107569721115535
8423039,2,B004CJB0BI,"I thought this would be like the first Resident Evil movie, with a bunch of scientists trapped in a facility with zombies. Instead, you have a bunch of scientists talking, talking, talking as they slowly get sick with a strain of H1N1 virus. Has a nice conclusion, but you'll be tempted to hit the fast forward button more than once.",1301184000,,333,4.566666666666666
8423040,1,B004CJB0BI,"A scientist who has created a vaccine to cure the H1N1 virus is funded by a transvestite looking uber-rich dame to develop a deadlier form of the virus which will speed the time between infection to death to three days. Since she controls the vaccine the world will fall at her knees for the cure and she will make billions. The scientists fellow doctors, lab assistants etc. are confined to an almost empty equipped lab in a basement while the doctor upstairs observes them on a monitor.  Also observing the doctor and those below is an albino henchman of the rich witch and with his long white hair he looks like a cross between the blonde, crazy dude from ""Die Hard"" and a wet mop.  Amongst the confinees in the basement is a plant who has been exposed to the deadlier form of bird flu and his job is to infect those below.  The plan is after he has infected the group he will sneak away, treated with the vaccine and paid handsomely.  He accomplishes his goal by walking among the doctors coughing his lungs out but of course he is double-crossed and ends up trapped with the other guinea pigs.

One by one they start feeling sick and begin to cough and spit up what  looks like dark, chocolate syrup. Soon enough a couple of the sickies pair up and do what bunnies do best and as I have always said..and I quote myself...""Nothin' does lovin' better than matin' while coughing and spittin' up dark chocolate syrup on each other.""

The doctor has a twinge of conscience and actually goes down to the basement to apologize to the doomed.  He also reveals the location of the vaccine and the address of his benefactress.  This so enrages the albino that he races down to the basement semi-automatic in hand and scolds the doctor by blowing his brains out.  Someone jams a hypodermic needle in the albino's eye and since most clear thinking albinos like two eyes, this one puts the gun to his own head and shoots.  Funny thing is the blood spurt from the exit wound looks suspiciously like dark chocolate syrup. To make a long review a little shorter, two escape, apparently find the vaccine and the uber rich dame ends up infected and confined to the basement while the cured couple watch.  The End.

The movie had a little potential despite being reasonably far-fetched but the movie ran into a couple of problems.

It sucked.  The actors sucked. The photography sucked.  The dialogue was written by a retard on crack and that sucked. The production values were thread-bare and shoddy and I'm guessing the bulk of the budget was spent on......dare I say it?----dark chocolate syrup!

I have to admit though I was sucked-in by the DVD cover and that really sucked but even so, I am sure that is easier to swallow than say a cup of...DARK CHOCOLATE SYRUP.",1299283200,5,2755,4.555780933062881
8423041,4,B004CJB0BI,"This is a great, scary movie. I stumbled upon this film and really enjoyed it.  If you like dark classic Italian horror you will like this film too. It's a true psychological horror and a great mashup of Roger Corman and Argento.  Lots of great gore effects also.",1297814400,4,263,4.458333333333333
8423042,1,B004CJB0BI,"I only found out about this movie because I was searching the shelves of my local Blockbuster for something to watch. After reading the back it seemed interesting. The movie is a low budget horror movie(which I don't mind) about a group of scientist who are researching the H1M1 disease, during the film they become infected and they become trapped in their workspace. The movie has poor lighting, not very good acting, and the plot really doesn't make sense sometimes. If I had a fatal disease and I was trying to escape and survive would I all of a sudden try to make out and have sex with someone? Bottom line do not rent even if you love horror movies like me, just pass on it, trust me.",1297036800,7,691,4.40625
