1340431,5,B00004CTW6,"OK... wrong film but the sentiment is still there!  Move faster BBC/Warner!

This time we get 2 series (10 and 11) from our favorite retirees.  From the press release:

""The world's longest-running sitcom returns with two seasons of high-jinx from everyone's favorite geriatrics! The lure of Georgian silver prompts the boys to scour the canal in a homemade glass-bottomed boat, and chaos ensues when Compo smuggles a dog into the hospital to cheer up an old friend. At Seymour's urging, Compo and Clegg try their hand at skiing on trays, and a Welsh ferret in compo's care has an eventful day out. Compo hopes that wind-surfing on an ironing board will win the ever-elusive admiration of Nora Batty, but the speed record goes to Edie's son-in-law Barry when he tangles with Wesley's oversized kite.""

Will BBC/Warner ever get this?

Anyway... here's my typical synopsis/opinion:

Don't be surprised if you are lukewarm to LOTSW on first viewing. This show grows on you over time. The first time I saw LOTSW I was underwhelmed... it was slow and seemed almost without a plot. But after watching a few more episodes I was hooked!

And again BBC/Warner... Get on with it! Make these *at least* bi-monthly!",1297382400,17,2678,4.900442477876106
1340432,4,B00004CTW6,"This is one of my all-time favorite Britcoms, and like others who have posted here, the BBC & Warner Brothers can't release them fast enough for me.

According to the BBC America Shop website, these are the episodes to expect in this one:

1. ""The Experiment"" - Compo wonders why all the blood rushes to his head when he's turned upside down. Seymour sets out to discover why. (16 October 1988)
2. ""The Treasure of the Deep"" - Is the piece of silver fished out of the canal really a thief's haul? Is there more where it came from? (23 October 1988)
3. ""Dancing"" - Compo's feet hurt, but why go to visit ""The Witch"" for a cure? (30 October 1988)
4. ""That Certain Smile"" - A visit by a much loved pet seems the only way to bring a smile to Clem's face during a spell in hospital. (6 November 1988)
5. ""Downhill Racer"" - Seymour tries to prove that skiing is more than just a winter sport for the rich. (13 November 1988)
6. ""The Day of the Welsh Ferret"" - Compo has an encounter with a ferret. (20 November 1988)
7. ""Come Back, Jack Harry Teesdale"" - Is Jack Harry's cumbersome caravan wrecking his marriage? Seymour seems to think so, so he drags in Compo and Clegg to lend a hand. (15 October 1989)
8. ""The Kiss and Mavis Poskitt"" - Clegg could be the answer to a lonely widow's prayer! Meanwhile, who is kissing who? (22 October 1989)
9. ""Oh Shut Up and Eat Your Choc Ice"" - The trio examines a haystack, resulting in their having to push it back to the top of a hill. (29 October 1989)
10. ""Who's That Bloke With Nora Batty, Then?"" - Compo is concerned when he sees Nora going out mysteriously and then sees her in the pub with another man. (5 November 1989)
11. ""Happy Anniversary, Gough And Jessie"" - The overly-domesticated Gough is a woeful sight to behold at his anniversary party, so the guys take him out for a bit of cavorting. (12 November 1989)
12. ""Getting Barry Higher in the World"" - No sooner than Seymour's spotting a kite does the trio end up building and attempting to fly their own gigantic version. (19 November 1989)
13. ""Three Men and a Mangle"" - Compo wants to help Nora Batty with a troublesome chore, but Seymour ends up taking over and fouling up the entire operation. Howard tests out a series of lame disguises. (26 November 1989)",1295913600,44,2259,4.350710900473934

1340508,5,B00004CTW6,"I am still enjoying this DVD.  It is worth watching over and over, day and/or night.  I have laughed at the three ole buddies who finds mischief and adventure to be fun-filled and rewarding. The writer, Roy Clarke, is a gifted writer to have such a fantastic imagination.  From Seymour's experiment gone wrong to smuggling another friend's dog inside a hospital to cheer him up is just part of the fun.  It is interesting to see Howard and Marina pop up in unexpected places as well as watching Eli make his cameo appearances.  This DVD is great.  It introduces characters such as the police officers who are unsuspected, accidental victims.  Of course the ladies add even more funny stuff to each episode,. This DVD is worth purchasing.",1406505600,6,737,4.755905511811024

1340540,5,B00004CTW6,I have been following this show ever since I saw it on PBS. It is a typical British comedy with just the right characters and just the right joke lines.
