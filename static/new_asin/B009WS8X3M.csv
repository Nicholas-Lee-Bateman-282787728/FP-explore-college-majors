8544757,4,B009WS8X3M,"If you enjoy watching the Independent Film Channel as much as I do then you'll probably enjoy seeing this short psychological drama, shot in and around Houston, Texas, and directed by Natassia Fissiak. ""dissOnance"" is the story of Troy (Kevin Dowd), a recovering alcoholic who seeks to destroy the marriage of his former lover after accidentally meeting her husband while working at a car dealership. Troy's life has been in shambles since his breakup with Marina (Karina Junker) nine years earlier and his budding music career has been on hold ever since. He resorts to setting up a blackmail scheme involving Marina's husband in hopes of getting her back into his life, no matter the consequences. I found the fantasy/dream sequence in this film to be stylishly reminiscent of the private party scene in Stanley Kubrick's final film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Carlos Sepulveda co-stars as Marina's husband. This film was entered in the short film category at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.",1359590400,3,983,5.074074074074074
