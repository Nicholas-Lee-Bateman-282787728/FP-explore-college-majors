3731584,5,B001OPQ1EO,"This movie is well shot and could easily be compared to the great type of biopics that hollywood used to make. No jerky cinematography in this one! My dvd that I bought here on amazon looked really smooth and the picture was very clear without marks or artifacts. This like all biopics does mainly stick to the facts but it like all biopics has does take some leeway.  That doesn't make this any less of a great movie though. It's A A Movie that is traditional and heroic and of course has cgi for battle effects. The first battle between the admirals cruiser and a battleship  is quite awesome, in reality that battleship only lost 8 lives though when it sank because the mine hole was slow enough to allow rescue of the crew.  But that's no worse than most hollywood biopics. This one though is gorgeous and looks for the most part historically accurate in many ways. With some mistakes. But it's very cool that todays russians can see what a great hero Admiral Kolcak was!
During the darkness of the horrible communist soviet rule they would have been taught he was a villain! There are some big battle scenes in this movie that reminded me of war and peace somewhat even though this was ww1-russian civil war period. personally I wish they'd call it ww1 and ww1 russain civil war theater. because they run together in  history and bloodshed.
This movie also features the great true love story of the admiral and his second wife who too.  She was alot younger than him and the movie doesn't tell us that she had kids too , just like he did.  But in those days people were wed by 19 usually!
This is a great movie that is very well done. You could do a miniseries on the admiral easily. But this movie is concerned with the admiral's last four years only.  1916-20.  And his rise to head the white russian forces who unfortunately lost the war , the u.s. and many other countries intervened during the 1917-1920 conflict but not with enough help to matter.  And then lenin came into power and murdered many millions. Hollywood needs to make some movies like this again. Stories about real heroes who fought for what was right instead of endless dirty cop movies and druggy antihero things. (which have their places in small doses)  They are ok but people need to remember heroes of the past to find out who they can be.",1275436800,4,2321,4.491686460807601
3731585,5,B001OPQ1EO,"""Admiral"" is a 2008 Russian movie about Admiral Alexander Kolchak set shortly before and after the Russian revolution (1916 to 1920). Everything about this film is of the highest quality (actors, editing, dialogue, cinematography, art direction, special effects, costumes, sets, etc.). I shall not provide any details about the plot of this film since this act would make me guilty of spreading ""spoilers."" One caution to the timid: There are scenes of realistic graphic violence in the battle scenes of this film.

The subtitles are mostly excellent. However, it is quite odd that every time an English word (in the subtitles) should begin with a capital ""C"" it is shown with a capital ""O"" instead (e.g., Oheck instead of Check, Ozech instead Czech, Ohristmas instead of Christmas).",1274054400,3,783,5.165354330708661
3731586,2,B001OPQ1EO,"The film is excellent but the cost of the DVD was $99.00 + postage. For that price, I expected more than one DVD, especially as the film had recently been serialized into 10 parts of about 45 minutes' duration on Russian television. Only one DVD (with scenes cut out) was sent and the sender explained that the high price was due to that particular DVD being out of print. I still think the price is unreasonably high, especially as the one indicated on the package was $3.00. Also, while the sound was consistently good, the picture was sometimes jerky, which would suggest that the DVD could be a pirated version.

So, altogether, I am not very happy with this purchase.

3731587,5,B001OPQ1EO,"Admiral sheds light on one of Russia's most important military and political figures: Admiral Alexander Kolchak. The film starts off with Kolchak in command of a ship on a mine-laying expedition in German territorial waters during the First World War before opening a window into the (February-March 1917) Russian Revolution, the (October-November 1917) Bolshevik coup, and the subsequent bloody 1918-1920 Russian Civil War. The film provides for a very good description of pre-revolutionary and revolutionary Russia, presenting people and events slowly tearing at Russian society and by extension the country as whole.
The movie actually does an excellent job of transporting the viewer to early 20th Century Russia and presenting important people like Tsar Nicholas II, Alexander Kerensky, and French General Jonin, factions like the Reds (Bolsheviks) and the Whites, and much more.
Konstantin Khabenskiy, Elizaveta Boyarskaya, Anna Kovalchuk, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least. All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!
Andrei Kravchuk's Admiral is very well written and very well presented allowing for a thought-provoking movie that will provide food for thought well after it is over as it offers valuable insight into a very important period of Russian history.
Strongly recommended along with 1612 and the Barber of Siberia for those with a soft spot for all things Russian.",1247270400,5,1529,5.483050847457627

3731590,5,B001OPQ1EO,"Admiral Kolchak became the ""Supreme Ruler of all the Russias"" in November 1918. As head of the White Army in Siberia against the (Bolshevik) Reds, he was the primary ""Great White Hope"" so to speak, to end communism during the Russian Civil War. This film, however, is mainly a romance (with several powerful action scenes) set in Russia in World War One and in the Russian Civil War that immediately followed. The film is in Russian with English subtitles. I bought both versions, but do be sure to get the one that does not have the annoying ""jerking"" effect throughout...the other version is quite smooth. The film quality is stunning, the acting superb, the characters enticing. As author of a few books in the civil war period I had hoped for a movie twice the length, concentrating on Kolchak's tenure as Supreme Ruler, but alas. This subject would have been tough to tackle at under three hours and ""Admiral"" moves along quickly and is about half that in length. The Russians have shown just how ""artsy"" they can be and just how equal they can be to any movie-makers in the world in turning out a quality, high-class film. The beginning and the end of the movie tie together the overall story line and are accomplished in a particularly heart-wrenching way. You will fall in love with the leading actress (well, at least I did)and cheer on the White Army in the hope of saving the captured Admiral.

There's another version that comes with a CD, but the DVD has poor quality. This DVD is all-region NTSC so it will play on any normal North American DVD player. The film itself is a character driven, with superb acting, incredible lavish sets, and cinematography to drool over. It is produced and directed by the same team that did the fantasy horror films Nightwatch and Daywatch, so none of this should be much of a surprise I suppose. The synopsis on this page is fairly accurate, so no need to elaborate there. If you're expecting non-stop action, this isn't the movie. However, if you're in the mood for a fantastic film, that deals with history rarely discussed or even cared much about in this part of the world, then this is a great film.",1238025600,37,885,4.6075949367088604
3731593,5,B001OPQ1EO,"Andrei Kravchuk's ADMIRAL is a sweeping and magnificent epic portrayal of the last five years in the life of Russian Admiral Alexander Kolchak. Produced--perhaps incredibly--with support from the Russian Ministry of Culture, the film unfolds in the beginning amidst the filming of Sergei Bondarchuk's monumental WAR AND PEACE (1964), then quickly fades to a World War I naval battle (1914) aboard an Imperial Russian ship commanded by then-Captain Kolchak (with some amazing special effects and photography). Kravchuk traces Kolchak's great naval accomplishments and his meteoric rise to Vice-Admiral and command of the Russian Black Sea fleet. The abdication of Tsar Nicholas II and the assumption of power by Kerensky is detailed, and Kolchak temporarily leaves Russia. The triumph of the Communists brings him back, and at the head of the counter-revolutionary White forces, as Supreme Ruler of Russia. From this point until his final, tragic betrayal by the French commander at Irkutsk, onrushing events, heroic battle scenes, and a passionate but unconsumated love affair are expertly woven into the drama. Like many good films where we already know the eventual outcome, Kravchuk stresses character and explores the dramatic ramifications of what is happening to his characters---the ""forces of destiny.""  The final execution scene is quite moving, and then there is a transition back to 1964, this time with added meaning.

The Russian DVD version is ""all regions,"" and although dialogue is in Russian, subtitles are available in English. The print is very good, although the version with subtitles is at times a bit jerky. Nevertheless, with such a marvelous film, and the chances of it being commercially released in the US so small, I must give this release five stars. It is well worth your time to search it out.

That today, some ninety years after the Bolshevik Revolution, the Russian government could support the production of such an epic (and generally favorable) account of the supreme leader of the White forces of the Russian Civil War is incredible in itself. And the film is well-worth the time and effort to acquire. Highly recommended.",1236297600,12,2160,5.273255813953488

3731595,5,B001OPQ1EO,"I would recommend this movie to those who like historical movies.  You don't have to be Russian to appreciate the movie's themes of patriotism, duty, and love, and I am glad that my wife asked me to buy this one for her.  It is hard to write a review without giving up the plot, but let's just say that ""the admiral"" (briefly) falls on the ""wrong side of history"" trying valiantly to defend Russia from the Bolsheviks following World War I. Ultimately, he is now considered a hero in Russia and admired for his abilities.  There was a time when fighting for what you believed in was valued in this country.

I wish the full length would also be available, because the subject of the film - Russian Civil War and its heroes - is very important and helpful in understanding how communism was possible, that the Russians did fight against it (like other peoples in the former East), and that the modern Russia discovers and appreciates the fallen generals, including amiral Kolgeac. Even the compressed version of the film presented on DVD is well made, however some previous knowledge of history of those times is necessary to account for the missing details.

3731600,4,B001OPQ1EO,"'Admiral' is a movie that brings a much-maligned historical figure to life, in epic form.  Told from the viewpoint of Anna Timireva, the viewer is given a glimpse into the the last four years of the life of Admiral-turned-'Supreme Ruler of Russia,' Aleksandr Kolchak.  From single-handedly using quick wit to destroy a German warship in WWI to fighting Reds in Siberia in the Russian Civil War, director Andrei Kravchuk glosses over all the bad traits of Kolchak and creates a 'superheroic' figure with Christ-like symbolism, a real-life man who was ostracized as epitomizing all the evil in the world during Soviet time.  Interwoven within the story of a heroic man is a love story, very melodramatic, about the affair between Kolchak and Timireva, wife of his friend.  The beauty of a lost time (Imperial Russia) and the people who were lost due to political ideology are recreated in a way that is countering the Soviet ostracization of such a figure.

The film is a ""whitewashed"" biopic of the last years of Admiral Kolchak (1916-20).  It is from the point-of-view of his ""mistress"" and is multi-layered.  Kravchuk shows that both men and women were caught in a struggle of political ideology and socialism won.  However, while many aristocrats left Russia forever, Kolchak and Timireva stayed, out of love of country, regardless of the outcomes (Kolchak is executed for being an enemy of the state; Timireva goes to the GULag camps).  It is also a film about the new generation of filmmakers attempting to recreate and reanalyze their nation's past history, one that was one-sided and had to toe a certain line (so to speak).  It is a counterpoint, a counter-history, to Soviet cinema, as well as an attempt to bring certain historical truths to the table by showing this counter-history.

It is not a bad film, but the American viewer who watches Hollywood features will probably be disappointed.  It will feel like Cameron's ""Titanic,"" with a love story and heroism against the odds.  It relies heavily on Hollywood for its storytelling approach, with heavy melodrama and allegorical representations of Christ in the character of Kolchak.  However, it is told through the eyes of a much older Timireva, whose love for Kolchak was well-known through her words, both oral and written.  Where the Soviet cinema chose to not show strong female characters (exceptions include 'Commissar""' (1966) and Shepitko's 'Wings' (1967), and, to an extent, 'Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears' (1980), the 'voice' of the Russian female was not widely used.

""Admiral"" is not available in NTSC.  It is an import.  The success of the movie spawned a 10-part TV series, also available on DVD, but NOT with English subtitles!  Uggh!

Make sure you purchase the ""Blue Cover"" dvd+cd set (With KINO in Cyrillic on the top) - not the one with ""ADMIRAL"" in English with the pink/blue/green cover.  This is what I am reviewing.  I am unsure if the copy I bought is entirely legal, or the other one, for that matter.  True Russian releases usually have a hologram sticker on the cover when it is a legal copy, and mine did not.  However, the copy I received had no apparent problems with its playback.  The visuals look to be a bit blurred in screens, but I do believe that is mainly due to CGI effects more than anything.

4 of 5 Amazon stars.  Most people will hate the love story that takes up as much time as the story of Kolchak, WWI, and the Russian Civil War that followed.  However, this is a Russian film for Russian people, first and foremost.  It was a blockbuster!",1380153600,2,3554,4.828099173553719
3731601,4,B001OPQ1EO,"I gave this movie 4 stars because its great, but not totally as I expected.
That's because I earlier watched a Youtube video wich I tought was only about this movie,
but now I saw the movie I realised the video was mixed with scenes from other movies about the Russian civil war.
So I expected scenes to come, which didn't came. Not the movie makers mistake of course, but it had
an influence on my experience.
I recommend this movie to everyone who is intrested in the Russian history, revolution, civil war or just wants
to see a Russian movie. Because its a very good one!

3731602,5,B001OPQ1EO,"As I sit here writing this review, I can still picture the scenes of the naval officers being shot for no reason other than the fact that they were Imperial Navy officers.  And all the waste of the young men!  The film opens during the First World War as Kolchak lures a larger gunned German ship onto mines that he himself planted, showing the steel nerve that the Russian had in battle.  He is rewarded with a promotion.  But when the revolution comes, he sees the other side, as he is unable to convince Kerensky that the young officers are needed if Russia is to stay in the war.  In fact, this is something that I had originally thought that just the communists did when they took over, but it now appears, after further research, that Kerensky's revolution was more like the Jacobin's in France.  This is a Russian film with large subtitles and well worth the viewing.  In fact, I will want to see it many times to digest all the film presents, from the love story of Kolchak and the wife of friend, to his ultimate end in Siberia at the hands of the communists when he come back to fight in the civil war.  Over all, when you are told about how a picture is worth a thousand words, it is the images that stick with you.  One viewing of this film will confirm that and heighten your interest in the whole period.  Indeed, the images of the dead officers in the lake tied to rocks to keep them down, still sticks with me, weeks later.",1362700800,,1439,4.315985130111524

3731604,4,B001OPQ1EO,"An interesting, if flawed, biopic about Alexander Kolchak, Russian admiral during World War I, and after the Russian revolution, leader of the Russian whites during the civil war. I know the Soviet Union ended more than 20 years ago, but I was still surprised to see such a reverent movie about one of the leaders of the Russian whites. For example, the scene where Kolchak takes command of his army with the blessing of the Russian Orthodox Church is told with soaring musing, and without any hint of irony. And the story of his romance with the wife of one of his fellow officers adds very little (in fact, probably detracts) from the film. In summary, a generally well made film and with a relatively generous budget, but a bit too reverent and solemn toward its subject.",1361577600,,774,4.656934306569343

3731606,3,B001OPQ1EO,"I have to agree with the reviewer who advised to watch this film for entertainment purposes, rather than any realistic treatment of its subject.  Post-Soviet Russia is still in desperate search of ""national heroes"" as foils for current state policy.  Glomming onto Admiral Kolchak, the would-be ""Supreme Ruler"" of the Siberian civil war, is as desperate a ploy as the Chapayev flics of Soviet times.  I expect to next see Chilean studios come out with a lavish production on the heroic career of Augusto Pinochet.

But because of those production values I'll give it three stars for technical effort. Even had the rush to save Kolchak proved successful, it would not have saved the White side of the civil war any more than the integrity of this film.",1349049600,2,751,4.84375
3731607,3,B001OPQ1EO,"This is the original theatrical release.  Apparently there was a significantly longer Tv series release one year after the motion picture release.  The feature film release does feel jumpy in it's story and character development.  It is in essence a love story, and as such it feels a  bit awkward.  There are a lot of dramatic one liners, but little development of the relationship.  Furthermore there are several characters seemingly important to the story, but hardly introduced.  All of this would indicate that the much longer television release would likely be a significant improvement.
In all fairness I must say that the first 20 minutes of the film are excellent.  One of the best movie openings I have ever come across.  Let's hope that the TV series will be released on DVD.",1342224000,3,786,4.893939393939394
3731608,4,B001OPQ1EO,"I am quite glad that I saw this film, and I rather liked it, although it certainly has many flaws.

""Admiral"" is supposed to tell the story of life, struggle and death of Admiral Alexander Vasilyevich Kolchak (1874-1920), a man probably completely unknown to most people in the West - but quite familiar to those from Eastern Europe. Being Polish and having grown under the communist rule, I quite well remember this name as one of the most famous ""boogeymen"" used in the official propaganda. Already in elementary school we had to read some Soviet books describing adventures of heroic little children who in time of Russian Civil War helped to the best of their abilities to defeat the hideous hordes of ""White"" evildoers commanded by the monstrous bloodthirsty wraith dressed in a sailor uniform - the Admiral! The hatred the communists still felt towards this man even 60 years after his death was unbelievable - but somehow understandable as, together with general Denikin, he gave them probably the biggest scare in the whole history of their sinister movement...

As this film describes only four last years of Kolchak's life (1916-20), it can be interesting to have a short look at his earlier life. Son of Major-General Vassily Kolchak, a veteran of Crimean War and specialist in coastal defence, he quite naturally followed in his father tracks by joining the Navy in 1894. After four years spend in Far East Fleet (Vladivostok, 1895-99), he volunteered to particularly dangerous duty in Arctic expeditions organised by Russian Navy (1900-1903). Having survived two long expeditions (from which some of his companions didn't return), he was reaffected again to the Far Eastern command and arrived there just in time to take part in the defense of Port-Arthur (1904-05) against the Japanese, first serving on cruiser ""Askold"".

He then received the command of the destroyer ""Serdityi"" and he led this ship in numerous mining operations. A minefield laid by ""Serdityi"" is credited with destruction of Japanese cruiser ""Takasago"" on 13 December 1904. After all Russian ships in Port-Arthur were disabled by fire of Japanese artillery and lack of coal and spare parts, Kolchak commanded a coastal battery (like his father in the Crimean War). Badly wounded, he was ultimately taken prisoner when the Port-Arthur garrison surrendered on 2 January 1905.

Between 1905 and 1914 Kolchak worked on reconstruction of Russian Navy. He soon became an authority on mines and mine warfare. His other speciality was designing powerful modern ice-breakers and studying problems of travel in Arctic waters he also acquired a considerable scientifical reputation as glaciologist.

In the beginning of World War I he was affected to Baltic Sea Fleet and charged with laying a defensive bareer of extensive minefields. Once Russian bases were safe behind those protections, he proposed a vast operation of offensive mine-laying raids in German coastal waters and was designed to co-ordinate it. Although promoted already to Rear-Admiral, he insisted to participate in all those dangerous mining operations on board of small destroyers, amongst his men. Minefields his ships laid in Baltic Sea between 1914 and 1916 caused a great lot of trouble to Germans until the end of the war.

The action of the film begins at the very end end of his Baltic Sea exploits, just before he was promoted to Vice-Admiral and named Commander-in-Chief of Black Sea Fleet. WARNING! There will be some SPOILERS ahead!

This film is not however a real biography - it is rather a ""hagiography"" of this very controversial man, avoiding black spots and focusing on his achievements, his religiosity and his personal life. ""Admiral"" has definitely many flaws:

- the first battle scene in the film is historically completely inaccurate, although inspired by real events; it describes the destruction of powerful German armoured-cruiser SMS ""Friedrich Carl"" and this is a historical event; however ""Friedrich Carl"" was sunk on 17 November 1914 (in the film it happens in 1916) and even if she was destroyed by mines laid by Russian destroyers commanded by Kolchak, at the moment of her sinking he himself was NOWHERE NEAR the site of her demise (entry to German port of Memel)...

- there is no mention of conditions in which Kolchak seized the power over the Provisional Government of Russia in Siberia (in reality he more or less made a coup d'etat)

- there is not even one mention of the very harsh way he dealt with all communists, real or suspected, during his great anti-Bolshevik offensive in 1919; in real history, Kolchak didn't hesitate to execute hundreds of people to eliminate all support for Bolcheviks in conquered areas; although it is also fair to say, that whatever atrocities he committed, they were peanuts compared to what communists were doing in the same time; it is safe to assume that for every hunded people executed during the Russian Civil War by the Whites, the Bolcheviks killed one thousand

- there is no mention of grievous mistakes he did in 1918-19; Admiral Kolchak was many things, but a politician and a diplomat he was not; by trying to return the land which peasants seized by force in 1917-18 to its rightful previous owners he alienated large parts of Siberian population and helped create a vicious guerilla on his communication lines; he turned against him the non-Bolchevik leftists (""esers"" and ""mencheviks""); he lost at critical moment the support of Czech and Polish troops fighting initially on Whites side in Siberia; and finally he didn't manage to obtain any support from foreign troops which entered Siberia in 1918 (Japanese and Americans)

- and finally the film gives too much place to the romance between Kolchak and his mistress, Anna Timiryova - and as a consequence there is not enough time left to treat war and history

But there are also many other points, which I liked very much and which made the watching of this film a rather enjoyable experience:

- the first battle scene (the destruction of ""Friedrich Carl""), although historically inaccurate, is a very very powerful and touching one;

- the scenes of desintagration of Russian armed forces just before the revolution, including the one in which Kolchak is challenged by his own sailors, are excellent; the fate of officers and cadets during the revolution is shown in a terrifying (and terrific) way

- the scene in which the White Army in Siberia, standing in the immaculate snow, swears solemnly to fight for God and country is a splendor - I confess that I actually had tears in my eyes at the end...

- the great bayonet charge of White soldiers, who have no more munitions so they have to go take them from the enemy, is a REALLY great one

- the terrifying Great Siberian Ice March of White soldiers from general Vladimir Kappel's army is IMPRESSIVE (and it is a very real event)!

- the surrealist train trip which brings Admiral Kolchak to his fate is at least as good as the train voyage from ""Doctor Zhivago""

- the scene in which Kochak finally meets his destiny is extremely powerful and beautiful

- and last but not least, let's just say that Elizaveta Boyarskaya, who plays Anna Timiryova, is a drop dead gorgeous, eye-hurting-level beauty. Every moment of her screen presence is a pure delight.

- the post-scriptum scenes showing the later life of Anna Timiryova are very, very touching; the communists have so much feared and hated Admiral Kolchak, that even after his death, unable to reach his family (his wife and son lived safely in France), at least they kept tormenting his last mistress, for no less than FORTY years!

So all in all, I give to this film four stars, even if it is maybe a little bit too generous - but I ultimately rather liked it. Also, I am happy that this movie was made and that, although far from perfection, it gave some respect to all those soldiers of the White Armies, who not only lost their war and their lifes, but then kept being insulted and vilified for the next 70 years in every possible way and by every possible media - almost as if the communists feared that one day they could rise from their graves and overthrow them; which is in a certain way exactly what happened in 1991...",1340928000,10,8227,4.907127429805615

Here's the essential difference between a Russian film and a Hollywood production: In a Hollywood film, it's typically all about the actors. In the few instances where there could have been a good story, the commercially-oriented producers make the tale so predictable as to diminish the drama. With a Russian film, *all* the emphasis is on the story and the actors simply carry it out in the most artful way. Russian stories themselves are largely quite different from Western ones. In the West, we focus upon the *destination* -- in Russia, the *journey* is more highly valued and thus punctuated, such as one might encounter in poetry.

The story here is about a Russian Admiral, initially faced with fighting the Germans during World War I from his battleship. Of course the Russians signed a separate peace agreement with Germany subsequent to the 1917 Russian Revolution and after Lenin had seized the provisional government from Kerensky, even though the Allies fought on against the Kaiser and ultimately defeated him.

The Tsar and his family were murdered (not part of the film, but just to help in understanding what happens next) and the Red Bolsheviks [Communists] raged on in a Civil War against loyalists, the latter of whom retained a faction of the Russian Army and who received some marginal aid from their former allies of the war. In Moscow and St. Petersburg, Tsarists and the nobility, along with many military officers, were murdered by the Red Bolsheviks outright. The Civil War moved East and the Admiral who had successfully defeated the Germans in battle so valiantly from his ship had ultimately become Lenin's opposite and nemesis.

Great leader that he was, the Admiral was hardly a flawless man. He had a wife and child but he chose (or was emotionally compelled) to fall in love with a fellow officer's stunning wife. The account tracks these two soulmates across Siberia to a last stand against the Communists. It's a compelling tale and essentially a true one to boot.

The landscapes and sets are nothing short of spectacular, the cinematography is inspired, and the script is flawless. Gleb Matveychuk composed the magnificent filmscore, one which notably enhances nearly every scene, given it's essential Russian-ness. The subtitles are quite easy to read and the translation is perfect. This is 124 minutes of pure film-lover's delight. It's a 2008 production, shot in letterbox format -- it looks beautiful on a widescreen television.

You won't get hurt on this one -- my highest recommendation!",1301875200,9,4044,6.618867924528302

The primary personalities are presented to be of great strength and to be admirable (no pun intended). The reason that I did not give it more 'stars' is that I don't know how accurately the script depicts actual events: more than a few of the events/ turns appear to be incredulous, unrealistic. If these incredulous moments are in fact accurately presented, the feature deserves at least 4 'stars'. Oh, by the way, the naval battle scenes use somewhat 'cheap', amateurish, special effects.

3731617,3,B001OPQ1EO,"The film never touched me in any way.

DISCLAIMER: I enjoy war movies when well made. I have no problem with foreign language movies with sub-titles. I only care for the movie itself.

Aleksandr Kolchak is a towering figure in Russian history. He led the whites against the communists and for many years was seen as the Arch Enemy of the Soviet Union. But after the fall of Communism a revival has occured and he has become something of a legend.

Kolchak was indeed the stuff of legend, a decorated and brave naval commander that rose through the ranks on proven ability. Portraid as upright and righteous he is a rock in the sea of turmoil. So we are told and a few scenes support this.

The film is o.k. at the start. Throw in a few battle scenes with similiar CGI animation as Star Wars (and about as unreal and cartoonish) we get a decent feel for Kolchak the Admiral. Then we get a good feel that the commies were bad. They go off on a killing spree and various ways are depicted of how they killed all the nice officers. A few powerful moments here.

Then Kolchak turns his back on the new regime and all of a sudden he is leading the White Guard without any effort to how that came about. Nor do you get any paticular feel for the war itself. But you do get to see he spent a lot of time on a train. The Crusade against the Bolsheviks is a complete let down.

Far more effort is spent on a strange love story between Kolchak and Anna. She is pretty, granted, but how he becomes love stricken is seems to be solely on her looks and the whole affair dominates the movie for the better part but is far from interesting or explained to satisfaction.

To say that this is a dramatical rewrite on history is streatching things very far, and that was rather what I was hoping for. Instead I get a category romance with great custume settings and historical figures in a sympathetic light. So you are made care for Kolchak, you are told what an upright guy he was and the commies are clearly bad.

On the whole I felt rather duped. The few battle scenes are either mediocre CGI or very limited in scope, you get very little feel for the battles. History is barely touched except in passing and the category romance does not carry the film that could have been more. Certainly it holds no place among the best of foreign cinema in my collection.

I found the film mildy entertaining, but now that I have watched it I have no reason to see it again.",1298592000,4,2447,4.302173913043478
3731618,5,B001OPQ1EO,"The war is the huge background. But the love story among Anna and Alexander is portrayed with artistic conviction without falling into commonplaces. The War sequences are first-rate, the cinematography and the rhtmyic pulse are also overwhelming.

Radiant masterwork.",1294358400,2,387,5.771929824561403
3731619,3,B001OPQ1EO,"History has always been a somewhat fluid commodity in Russia, with one decade's hero of the Revolution another's traitor as the propaganda needs of the day dictated, and judging from Andrey Kravchuk's 2008 epic Admiral the reverse trajectory is just as likely in the New Russia, with one of Tsarist Russia's most notorious and dictatorial mass murderers, Admiral Aleksandr Vasileyevich Kolchak, whitewashed into a noble romantic hero. It's a bit like a film celebrating the humanitarian achievements of one of Pol Pot's executioners or showing the loveable side of Heinrich Himmler.

Former Polar explorer Kolchak may have fought on the `right' side as the leader of the disastrous White Russian resistance to the Revolution, but he was so utterly ruthless in his suppression of the people, thinking nothing of killing and torturing 25,000 civilians in one city alone and exhorting his generals to exterminate entire local populations, that no foreign government in the world would recognise his government. And while a certain amount of communist propaganda might be expected to exaggerate his very real failings and cruelty (which in many ways guaranteed the victory of the Bolsheviks he despised), he wasn't overly popular with his own allies either, many of whom regarded him as a pro-British puppet before even the British turned against him and his Czechoslovak allies handed him over to the Reds. So, all-in-all, not one of the likelier candidates for an admiring biopic with a cast of thousands, but in Putin's Russia such is the stuff of heroes. Like Braveheart, you have to forget any thoughts of historical fidelity and just take it as a kind of wishful thinking period fantasy.

Of course, Kolchak was far from the only war hero to spectacularly blot his copybook when he got into politics to save his country from itself, as hundreds of examples from Pompey to Petain have shown, and there could have been a fascinating story in how the very qualities that made him an ideal warrior were disastrous in politics. But that's not the kind of film this is: Admiral is pure print the legend stuff. Kicking off with a spectacular and genuinely exciting naval battle that sees Kolchak (Night Watch's Konstantin Khabenskiy) crippling a German battleship single-handed before despatching it in a tense chase through a minefield, it's clear we're in mythmaking rather than debunking territory here. It's the kind of love story where the sun is always shining beautifully, even when it's raining, where bloody battles are accompanied by love letters being read in adoring voice over, where even in the midst of evacuating a city the hero can find time for a railway station reunion with his lover, where pledges to protect God and country are accompanied by thousands of kneeling extras and soaring devotional music and where even his wife understands why he'd have an affair with the most beautiful woman in all the Russias (Elizaveta Boyarskaya) without kicking up too much of a fuss. His allies may betray him and the odd regiment desert, but the people love him more than life itself - not too surprising since we never see him mistreat a single peasant, let alone destroy a city. All that's missing is John Wayne saying ""Aw, truly this man was the Son of God."" Watching the film you have to wonder how he could ever have lost so disastrously.

Opening and closing on the set of what's clearly meant to be Bondarchuk's War and Peace, it sets its political stall out early: even 44 years later, Party officials want to fire an extra who was the lover of an enemy of the Revolution despite the director's insistence on keeping her because he needs faces like hers (if the casting of a svelte actor as the portly Bondarchuk seems odd, it's perhaps excusable since it's actually his son, Fyodor Bondarchuk). And that's probably the nicest the Communists get in this film. We get plenty of examples of the Bolsheviks' random acts of cruelty and mass murder, but never any of the outrages on the Tsarist side that led to them: indeed, it's not until the Revolution that we even see some workers, the film being strictly an officer class affair until then. Considering the role of the Russian navy in the revolution, it's more than just a massive oversight in a film about an admiral... But then the film's sins of omission are many and massive. It even drops broad hints that Kolchak's government was recognised by the allies while his atrocities are washed completely from the record.

So far, so reprehensible. But while it may be crudely simplistic in its unquestioning hero-worship, it's often superbly executed as a piece of epic cinema. Like the best propaganda movies, for all the heavy-handed unjudgemental mythmaking it carries you along with a skilful appeal both to unashamed populist sentiment - it's not how history was but how it should have been - and by not forgetting to be entertaining along the way. It's well acted, beautifully photographed with some spectacularly vivid imagery and the kind of superlative production design that hasn't been seen since the roadshow epics of the 60s. As history it may be a worrying travesty, but as a grand old-fashioned CinemaScope Glorious Technicolor romantic epic with a cast of thousands and some pretty impressive special effects, it's undeniably effective. Still, one can only wonder what the producers are planning to follow it up with - Eichmann: The Garden Party Years, perhaps?",1292716800,3,5442,4.963815789473684
3731620,4,B001OPQ1EO,"Don't expect ""Admiral"" to clarify the extremely complex political situation of this period. Either you know it already and can fit the film into its context, or you don't, in which case focus on the romance. Of which there are some peculiar aspects: Kolchak never smiles at his mistress (the passion appears almost one-sided) and to the end, they continue to address each other using the name/patronymic convention instead of first names. (And there's not the faintest hint of sex.)  However, the movie is still a sweeping epic of a kind to satisfy fans of ""Doctor Zhivago."" It seems to have been very carefully filmed, with lavish settings, reasonably good costumes, and moderately good acting. Momentous historical events, even if imperfectly explained, transform it from a B-movie into a B-plus. The technical quality of my version of the DVD was excellent (except for a few English subtitles laid right over Russian ones, toward the end, but I can live with that).",1290729600,2,968,5.012422360248447

It's beautifully made however, and enough happens to keep interest if you want to stick it out.",1287014400,,450,4.6375
3731622,3,B001OPQ1EO,"My son and I were in Russia in October 2008. I was amazed to see the billboard ads for ""The Admiral"".  Though there had been some positive treatment of the White Guard before in ""Silent flows the Don"" and ""The White Guard"" (aka ""Days of the Turbins"") this film offered to take a previously demonized figure of Alexander Kolchak and make a positive biopic of his life.
The filming is quite good though the editing leaves a lot to be desired. Watching the additional material on the DVD (which you will lose out on if you do not speak Russian) it is obvious that some scenes which would have gone a long way to explaining a very complex period of Russian history were cut. Kolchak goes from being sent to the US by Kerensky to all of a sudden being in Siberia and taking the oath of his troops. The viewer does not really get a sense of the many factions vying for power: the Reds, the Whites, the Greens. Among the Reds the bolsheviks and the SRs; among the Whites the monarchists, the liberal democratic forces - Kolchak, Denikin, Wrangel, Yudenich, etc. The place of the Czechs is not really explained, or the Americans. There are American flags displayed in several scenes.
It was interesting to see Fyodor Bondarchuk playing his father Sergei Bondarchuk in the scene with the filming of ""War and Peace"".
Kolchak is depicted as a very cold duck. He never displays emotion. You never get the sense that there is any passion between him and Anna. Throughout the film, even at the end, they are using the formal ""vy"" instead of the personal ""ty"" form of ""you"" which someone relying on the English subtitles will lose. You never get the sense that there has ever been any intimacy between them.

But despite a few nods to the heroic Russian spirit of patriotism and self-sacrifice, and the nation-changing events of the Russian Revolution, this is really not a political movie, any more than ""Titanic"" was fundamentally about ship-building.

And that - in the central love story - is exactly where the absolutely beautiful cinematography and lush story-telling make one oblivious of the subtitles. Whoever created the recent, wretched ""Pearl Harbor"" could have learned a lot about grafting a love story on a war movie from these Russian filmakers. For ""Pearl Harbor,"" it ruined both the romantic movies AND the war movie; here the themes are integrated gracefully, naturally, and without stress.
