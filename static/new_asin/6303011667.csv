This story begins in 1865 with a Civil War battle. One man falls to the ground, then rises and runs back to his lines. General Grant awaits the return of Bill Hickok, who has news about the enemy's plans. ""Have it your own way, Bill."" The Confederates spot Bill leaving the Union lines! But Bill escapes. Then the war is over. Bill attends a Victory Ball. He tells Maryanne how that picture saved his life. Stephen explains his job with the Santa Fe Railroad to ship cattle east. That note is delivered. [Isn't this trick still used today?] There is a business problem: the expected shipments are not arriving. Bill and Whiny are headed for Kansas. Elsewhere a herd of white-faced cattle is refused passage across private property. They will use the North Pass. But the gang has plans to hijack this herd. Someone takes a shot at Bill. In the country that gang wants the brands changed since there is a new Marshal in town. Bill and Whiny follow that herd's trail.

Bill scans the brands on that herd. He is seen, and shots are fired at him. The gang chases Bill and Whiny, but they escape. The gang must now move that herd fast. A rider fires on them. There is a surprise! Bill learns who is the owner of that land. Who shot Steve? Bill sees the three guns on the floor, and surmises what happened. Mr. Jones is hard of hearing. ""You're looking in a mirror."" Bennett tells about the herd in the North Valley. The trick about Steve works, someone shoots at a resting Steve. They follow this man. Bill finds the gang leader. There is a fight, Bill wins. The end of the rustler gang means better business. Cattle will be shipped to the East again. New orders send Bill and Whiny to the Twin Cities.

This story has a good plot, but somehow seems about average. It avoids the question about the cowboys who accompanied the herds that were rustled. Yes, it is a low budget film. Its purpose seems to show how an unregulated private business that benefits its owners can damage the economy as a whole. And this was seventy years before the Crash of 2008!

Bill Hickok led a very interesting life. He was a member of the Anti-Slavery forces before the Civil War, rode for the Pony Express, was a member of the Union Army, and a Buffalo hunter. He was a law officer in his last years. Hickok was the subject of many dime novels before and after his death. Some said his name was originally Haycox, but he changed it to avoid problems. There was no official record of any spying during the Civil War, but there is a gap in his employment by the Army during the war.",1277856000,,2584,4.4222689075630255
