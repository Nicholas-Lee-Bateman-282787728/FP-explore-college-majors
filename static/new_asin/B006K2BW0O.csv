8499959,3,B006K2BW0O,"It was a region 2 and wouldn't play on my DVD.  Wasn't aware of this but since the smurf dvd's hardly ever come out my excitement got the best of me.  Still played on my computer but no special features either brought it down another notch.  Also, some of the episodes appear on other DVD's.  I hope the smurf DVD's start getting a little bit better like the first couple of volumes but I guess we'll see.",1497225600,,405,4.220779220779221
