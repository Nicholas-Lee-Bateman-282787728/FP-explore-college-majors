2223824,5,B0007OCG74,"No changes within the cast yet. One highlight from this season was when Lionel Jefferson(Damon Evans) and Jenny Willis(Belinda Tolbert) became husband and wife. This episode first aired in December 1976. DE joined the Jeffersons cast in the summer of 1975 after Mike Evans,who played Lionel originally,left to produce another CBS sitcom,Good Times,which he had co-created. ME would return for the seventh season in 1980. Olivia Jefferson,George's mother still frequently visited George(Sherman Hemsley) and Louise(Isabel Sanford). Marla Gibbs is now officially a Jeffersons cast member as Florence Johnston,the Jeffersons' wise-cracking no-nonsense maid. She even guest-starred in the series premiere episode. We still hear ""honky"" and ""zebra"" coming out of George's mouth. The ""honkies"" are the Jeffersons' neighbor Tom Willis(Franklin Cover),their next door neighbor Harry Bentley(Paul Benedict),doorman Ralph Hart(Ned Wertimer in a recurring role) and bank President H.W. Whittendale who is also the Jeffersons',the Willises and Harry's landlord. The ""zebra"" is Jenny,who's half-caucasian on her father Tom's side and half-negro on her mother Helen's(Tom's wife played by the late Roxie Roker) side. Sadly,Sanford passed away on July 9,2004 at age 86 of complications from pneumonia. She was hospitalized five days earlier. Several months earlier,she received a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame. So I dedicate this item to the memory of Sanford.",1108339200,19,1450,5.84433962264151

2223864,3,B0007OCG74,The 3rd season of the Jefferson's was not that funny. There were funny moments and some shows that were funny but I feel like the show became about George working too much and Weezy and George arguing too much. I am a Jefferson fan so I would still buy season 3 regardless just to have it as part of my collection.

After being on the receiving end of some bad advice courtesy of George, Mr. Bentley finds himself in jail in the episode ""Bentley's Problem"", while Tom saves George's life after George nearly chokes on some popcorn in the episode ""Tom The Hero"". The only downside of this season is due to Zara Cully's absence as Mother Jefferson (due to illness), as she only appears in three episodes. Like the previous two seasons, Season Three is still top-notch, complete with solid contributions from the writers, producers & actors.

While I was nonetheless disappointed when I realized what I had bought had nothing to do with the aforementioned, I found a pleasant, serendipitous surprise in watching the actual show. The characters are rich, vibrant, and most importantly, black. I had never actually encountered a black person in my lifespan thus far, but this series of short documentaries seems to be an accurate representation of what the lives of black folk are like.

Their friends and neighbors, Tom and Helen Willis, are an interracial couple whose daughter, Jenny, married Lionel Jefferon in an unforgettable Christmas episode at least in my opinion. The show's topics ranged all over the place in this season. it was probably the last season for Zara Cully who played Mother Jefferson. I loved Mother Jefferson and believed that her absence was plagued by health reasons. Regardless, this show kept going and just got better instead of getting worse.

2223947,5,B0007OCG74,"Nominated for 13 Emmys and 8 Golden Globes, The Jeffersons was a groundbreaking situation comedy that was not only utterly hilarious, but also explored the controversial social issues of its day. Premiering in mid-season 1975, the show was a spin-off of the #1 hit series All In The Family, where main characters George and Louise were the next-door neighbors of Archie and Edith Bunker. During its nine-season run, The Jeffersons spent all but its last season as a Top 25 Nielsen rated show. One of the first sitcoms to center exclusively around the lives of African-Americans, The Jeffersons most likely featured television's first interracial married couple in Tom and Helen Willis. It was this fearless attempt to push the boundaries of the status quo that made the show one of the funniest of its time as well as a valuable resource for American race relations...

The Jeffersons follows the lives of George (Sherman Hemsley) and Louise Jefferson (Isabel Sanford), a middle-aged African-American couple who own a string of successful dry cleaning stores. The windfall generated by their business paves the way for George and Louise to ""move on up"" into an exclusive Park Avenue apartment. The series is made by Hemsley's portrayal of the stubborn and greedy, yet quite lovable, character of George whose sarcasm and antics are only equaled by the Jeffersons' quick witted live-in maid Florence (Marla Gibbs). A supporting cast composed of omni-present neighbors Tom (Franklin Cover) and Helen Willis (Roxie Roker), the ever-polite Bentley (Paul Benedict), and a tip-grubbing doorman named Ralph (Ned Wertimer) provide for endless sources of irritation and annoyance for George. Throw in George's mother (Zara Cully) and her constant insults of Louise, and The Jeffersons becomes one of the best-written humorous shows of its time...

The Jeffersons (Season 3) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""George and the President"" in which George's competition with his chief dry cleaning rival, Cunningham, really heats up. Cunningham launches a massive ad campaign to coincide with the nation's bicentennial celebration, prompting George to dress up as Thomas Jefferson in order to lure in customers... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""The Retirement Party"" in which George is prepared to sell out Jefferson Cleaners to a big corporate conglomerate until he reads the fine print and learns that many of his best workers will be fired, and ""Jefferson Airplane"" in which Louise urges her workaholic husband to take up a hobby, but he worries her when he decides to take up flying...

2223948,5,B0007OCG74,"I can't believe how long Columbia took to release season three, considering the great response seasons one and two recieved. Needless to say I could hardly wait to add season three to my collection. It had some of the best episodes, like when Tom and Helen make an attempt to improve Louise and George's marriage. Sherman Hemsley's comedic timing was priceless! I just loved the way he would express his continued dislike toward the Willises, despite Lionel and Jenny being married. I'm sure alot of people would love to be able to openly insult their in-laws and get away with it!!!

Thank goodness the episodes are crisp and have excellent sound quality. My only complaint is there are no extras. It would have been nice to see an on camera tribute to Isabel Sanford from surviving cast members and Norman Lear. Oh well, I guess I should be greatful to finally get the dvd.

COLUMBIA TRISTAR PLEASE DONT TAKE TOO LONG RELEASING SEASON FOUR!!!! I'd like to see the episode when Gary Coleman guest stars as George's nefew from hell.",1115424000,5,1032,4.727777777777778
2223949,5,B0007OCG74,"Oh, how I love everything about the 70s (the music, the movies and the TV shows). The Jeffersons remain one of the greatest shows of all time. Today we are forced to watch stupid reality shows, but back in the 70s this sitcom dealt with real issues in a funny and special way. This season, Marla (the maid) joins the cast full time after stealing the show as a guest star in the first two seasons. In later years, she was the reason why I continued to watch the show when the show started to decline. Sadly, Mother Jefferson's role is decrease to make room for Florence. It is clear that Mother Jefferson is ailing. Florence picks up where Mother Jefferson left off. As for George, he is still crazy and funnier than ever. He is still picking on Bentley and the Willis. Weezy is still funny and the rock of this show. Season 3 is not as good as Season 1 and 2, but a MUST HAVE to remember what a good show was about.",1115251200,2,916,4.2102272727272725

George&Weezy are the Ultimate Couple of Tv.,1113696000,4,353,5.2105263157894735
2223951,2,B0007OCG74,"I've watched more than half of the episodes in this season and I'm very disappointed.  I am a huge fan of the show and I can't recommend enough the first two seasons of the show which are hilarious and classic.  I don't know what happened in the third season because I remember some better episodes that must have come later in the show's run. The problem is the writing.  The situations, for the most part are lame, the scripts in this season are crude.  Florence seems sassy all the time for no reason and gets to be obnoxious, George is a loud mouth, Bentley has doors slammed over and over again in his face - it's like all the soul has been written out.  Maybe the writers didn't know where to go after the Jeffersons, who had been poor and middle-class got used to being rich. Louise (Wheezy) seems like just another rich woman on television - the show is about as safe as Family Affair or Don't Eat The Daises, with a little ""soul"" thrown in for flavor.  Even Mother Jefferson is used unimaginatively.  The ideas are all tepid, and many of the jokes are so jaw-droppingly stupid, you think how can anyone laugh at this stuff?

I may tryt to rent the fourth season first, if and when it comes out, because I don't know if the writers were fired and replaced for later seasons.  I really love this show when it deals with ""real"" issues (second season: Florence's suicide note, George's enmeshment with Mother Jefferson, Lionel and Jenny's breakup over a bought term paper, George's best friend sexually harrassing Louise).  But something really went wrong with this season.  I wish I'd been warned.",1113696000,5,1603,4.56993006993007

The big highlight: Florence the maid (Marla Gibbs) officially becomes a regular cast member. To this day, Florence remains one of the all-time great sitcom characters. As essayed by the wonderful Gibbs, Florence was sassy, sarcastic, achingly funny and a perfect comic foil for the loud and rambunctious Sherman Hemsley (George).
