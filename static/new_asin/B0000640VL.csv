1697741,5,B0000640VL,"I have two words to summarize this DVD, holy moley!!  I think everyone knows that David Blaine is the master of street magic, but who knew he had the power of superheroes??  He's like Superman, Spiderman, Batman and Hurcules rolled into one.  This video will fascinate you and demonstrate magic like that will remind you of PeterPan.  I highly recommend this video to anyone who is a fan of magic and mind-boggling feats.  David Blaine is a modern day wizard--but a lot cuter than Merlin!!",1021420800,2,489,4.705882352941177
1697757,5,B0000640VL,Cool to watch the magician do his thing. If you don't like this guy then don't buy his products. It's fine for me,1419984000,,113,3.9565217391304346

1697760,4,B0000640VL,"Although I really enjoy David Blaine I haven't been very happy with ANY of his DVD's. In my PERSONAL opinion, I couldn't care LESS about all the major ""show off"" routines he pulls...such as burying himself alive, living encased in ice for days. standing on a beam for weeks, etc etc etc. I want to see all the STREET MAGIC!!!! That's why I like him! All the other stuff is just done by having the right mindset and ""training"" and has NOTHING to do with actual magic! Unfortunately there is very little street magic on ANY of his discs!! Yes, they have some of his street magic but it only applies to about 20% of what is on the discs. The rest is all the other crap he wants to show off...expecting us to be impressed. I'm not. If you like all the stunts he pulls then perhaps you will like his DVDs....if not and you like more street magic like me then you will be very disappointed in any and ALL of his discs! Sorry Blaine....",1395532800,,929,4.254237288135593
1697761,5,B0000640VL,"I have a good time with David Blaine every time I watch him on TV or DVD. Haven't seen him in person, but it's clear that he's one of the best magicians ever. I don't like his recent stint, where he puts needles in his legs, etc.  Gross!  But, he is excellent on the other magic. Well worth the time and money to watch!",1391904000,2,319,3.96875
1697762,5,B0000640VL,"How does do it and what planet is he from?  Fascinating dvd that integrates the entertaining world of magic with everyday life.  I have repeatedly watched the ""illusions"" etc. that Mr. Blaine presents and am still entertained and baffled by many of them.  He is truly one of a kind and his presentations are as skillfully done as the results are amazing! ""Dallas Hall of Fame running back Smith, please take the deck and pick a card""...and then another unexplainable mystery unfolds.",1391644800,2,483,4.865853658536586

It's helpful to me as a magician so I can examine the subtleties he uses during his performances and adapt for myself.",1385164800,,171,4.3125
1697764,5,B0000640VL,"A great digital (DVD) compilation of his first shows.  I'm not his hugest fan (but I like him), but as a magician myself, it's nice to watch him to all of the great close-up tricks in his repertoire!

1697766,1,B0000640VL,"David Blaine's overrated presentation is not only tedious and frustrating to look at but it's trite. David Blaine absolutely does nothing original, exciting, or entertaining. The majority of his dull presentations are filmed in the low-income Ghetto of an inner city. He shows various racial and ethnic minorities a multitude of trite card tricks for most of the DVD. Even at the end of the presentation when he traps himself into a giant ice-cube left me bored and irritated. There was absolutely nothing interesting, entertaining, or unique in this film.

I've watched David Copperfield's DVD entitled Illusion which was profoundly impressive. David Copperfield does exciting and professional illusions and magic that feature elaborate presentations inside lavish theaters and outdoors, too. David Copperfield sets the standard and unfortunately David Blaine falls flat. David Blaine can't even compete with the pretentious Criss Angel.

I give this DVD an F-.",1345075200,,962,5.537414965986395
1697777,5,B0000640VL,"Well worth the watch, mainly because he performs right in front of people on the streets with no props, as it appears. When a performance leads you to say, How did he do that?, then it's worth watching. This is one of those. Great entertainment.",1232409600,,245,4.466666666666667
1697778,2,B0000640VL,"People don't even know how bad this is because they have not seen GOOD magic.
The real magic at work here is the hype and the publicity machine. Really, if David Blaine can be considered a great magician, then anyone can... He mumbles in a dead pan droll manner thru all his performances like a first year magic student that has no character or script.
The success of David Blaine just goes to show how magic is a great art that is rarely seen.",1230249600,,444,4.2976190476190474

1697782,5,B0000640VL,"Pick a card, put it back in the deck, then splatter the deck of cards against a store window. The card you chose stuck to the inside of the window and now faces out toward you. Or the same trick but the card ends up inside the firefighter's shoe, or in the kid's back pocket. David Blaine (born 1973) has taken his act to the streets, whether to the locker room of the Dallas Cowboys, ghetto kids, vacationers, or to every day people in the Mojave Desert and even Haiti. His feats of physical endurance are weird, like placing his palm on the pavement then rotating his body 225 degrees, or standing upright in a block of ice for 62 hours in Times Square. His mind-reading tricks are even weirder, like asking you to think of an important person, then having that name appear as a tattoo on his chest underneath his shirt. These tricks are amazing, but at 110 minutes the film drags. Fearless collects Blaine's three ABC television specials called ""Street Magic"" (1996), ""Magic Man"" (1998), and ""Frozen in Time"" (2000). Everyone knows that these tricks have an explanation, but the reward in viewing them is all in the reactions of the spectator-participants, which in Blaine's up close and personal style is off the charts.",1189728000,,1224,4.645161290322581

1697785,4,B0000640VL,I have to admit that I had never heard of David Blaine before. My husband wanted this for a birthday present so I bought it for him. I watched this show with him and was surprised that I liked it as much as I did being the sceptic that I am. David did some pretty awesome tricks and we are still trying to figure out how some of them could have been done. Some tricks seemed a little hokey but it was still very entertaining. I think this show would be suitable for the whole family as well. I am looking forward to another show to be released soon on DVD so I can buy it. Enjoy!,1163548800,3,579,3.9572649572649574
1697786,5,B0000640VL,This movie was pretty cool. The magic he does is pretty chill. It kind of trips you out. It is a good purchase. I would recommend if you like magic.,1163116800,3,148,3.966666666666667
1697797,4,B0000640VL,"Good dvd to check out, keeps you entertained.  The cards tricks get a little repetative.  Hes good at what he does but you tend to wonder if some of the tricks are pre planned in some way or if the people are in on it...who knows.  Still fun to watch.",1153612800,3,251,3.98

1697800,5,B0000640VL,"This move is fascinating.  Some of David Blaine's magic you may have seen elsewhere but some of it is simply astonishing.  I don't want to give away any of the specifics but this is a movie you'll find yourself ""rewinding"" to watch something one more time to try to figure out, ""How can he do that?!"".  But, that's only 1/2 of his story - the rest is in his tests of human endurance and finding the boundaries of what he can do.  Between this movie and one other, we see him perform these feats - he buries himself alive, he stays entombed in ice for days on end, and stands 10 stories above ground for a couple of days with no food, no water - simply perched on a platform that looked to be, at most, 2' x 2'.  Amazing.  I loved it.",1141171200,5,733,4.090909090909091
1697801,5,B0000640VL,"I love this DVD, it is so awesome because it's a compilation of all his magic shows that have ever aired plus it shows his frozen in ice stunt and how he prepared for it and what happened after the stunt.

1697802,4,B0000640VL,"A great DVD, David Blaine is a great close-up magician,

do not believe the people who tell you that Blaine is fake, because he isn't, offcourse he doesn't work alone, just simply because if he would, some things he does (card through window) would be impossible.

to rectify a kid's review earlier,

David Copperfield isn't a magician, he is an illusionist, completely different thing, also, Copperfield is a worlwide know phenomenon, way more famous then Blaine, and lastly, it's foolish to even think Copperfield creates his own magic, he has a team of well-paid people who create illusions FOR him.

great DVD, but i justed wanted to rectify.",1135036800,,646,4.953703703703703
1697803,3,B0000640VL,"Having been a close-up magician for over 13 years, I guess I might have a somewhat biased opinion about Blaine compared to most people who haven't really seen any good close-up magic before he came along. With that out of the way, here are some of the things I liked and disliked about the specials:

Pros: David Blaine seems to have helped to get rid of the stereotypical ""magican"" image that many people seem to have - the crazy guy in the top hat on stage using people in elaborate costumes and ornately decorated boxes. The presentation he uses is generally direct and to the point, making the effects seem potentially more impressive than they would otherwise have been. Plus, the feeling of being out on the street, in a more ""normal"" setting, makes everything seem more real than it would otherwise seem. Finally, I respect the amount of time he's obviously put into learning all the sleight of hand and presentation used in his effects, even if the actual effects all originated elsewhere.

Cons: Just about everything is edited really heavily, in some cases making it look like Blaine did things that are pretty much impossible to do in real life. In some cases, this is even somewhat pointless (like his levitation, for example), since he could have just shown the real version with as much impact. Also, it would be nice if he changed his patter (ie what he said during the trick) every once in a while . Granted, the seriousness of his presentation is one of the things that made him so popular and impressive, but hearing ""watch, watch, watch...."" over and over again gets pretty repetitive after a while. Lastly, some of his sleight of hand is pretty obvious in places (if you're watching his hands, not following his well-placed misdirection). With the amount of editing that the rest of the series had, you'd think it would be easy enough for him to simply redo the trick with other people so that it wouldn't be as easy to see what he was doing.

Anyway, that's my two cents on the series. If you haven't seen Blaine yet, it will probably be enjoyable to watch. Better yet, go see a good close-up magician in person if at all possible.",1132617600,13,2152,4.613577023498695
1697804,5,B0000640VL,"David Blaine is not only a good magician, but he is a good entertainer.  I liked the way he wrote his book.",1127606400,,107,3.8636363636363638
1697805,5,B0000640VL,"He is a very talented and gifted individual~  I was very mad to read some of the insults to his GIFT!  Must be jealous.  I could watch him forever...plus he very sexy on top of making you stop and question what the mind is capable of~  I wish he had a message board.  I'm HOOKED!  Buy this video, YESTERDAY~",1127606400,2,307,4.11864406779661
1697806,3,B0000640VL,"David Blaine is a wonderful, talented young magician who has obviously studied and practiced his craft well. So. Why does he use the camera as his accomplice? To anyone knowing anything about magic, the heavy-handed editing nearly pokes your eye out. Yes, it's fun for the lay-person, even the the old clown stunt, the Balducci Levitation. Blaine is too good for this. He could never do what he does in this DVD live. He and his crew search out only the reactions that ""freak people out."" Is this all that the magic arts are about? What about that shared intimacy with the audience, the sense that the magi and the audience Both help to create a moment of astonishment for each other? I find this lacking here, for the most part. For the young people interested in getting involved in the magic arts, there are much better forums and influences than a ""mysterious stranger."" Yeah, I know how he does it all, but I'm not jaded. I've see magicians bore a crowd with a Zombie, and other performers usher their audience into a lovely world of ""What If"" -- leaving them smiling, thinking, not freaked out or looking at the magician like he's from another planet. Blaine could do much better, if he didn't suffer from a serious lack of humility, instead of a dearth of self-promotion.",1110844800,8,1278,4.634361233480176

1697808,5,B0000640VL,"Most of David Blaine's magic is a close-up magic and as a previous reviewer said - yes, practicing magicians are familiar and can do most of the magic presented on this video.  Nevertheless, most people are not practicing magicians, and even those who are, will appreciate the presentation.  DVD is wonderful to watch and non-magicians in particular will be astonished and delighted.  Most of the magic revolves around sleight-of-hand - with cards, coins, rings, and bills, then you'll see levitation, which involves - hmm, mainly distraction (I guess it wouldn't be exactly sleight-of-feet), and then you'll watch David encased in a block of ice for three days and more fun stuff.  And you'll hear lots of screams from astonished participants.",1102118400,17,744,5.175
1697809,5,B0000640VL,"David Blaine will be the first to admit that his magic is all trickery as amazing as it is.  This DVD contains some of the most amazing tricks you'll ever see.  I was a bit dissappointed to find that he did use some editing techniques which cheapened his tricks, but if you take the DVD for what it's worth, there is still some amazing content.  I guess one of the advantages of using a camera is that you can edit it.  As for the levitation trick, in the Bonus Material there is one that shows how it looks to the person watching, which if you slow it down enough, you could see how he did it.  It's still very good.  Also, many of the card tricks can be figured out if you slow them down, but his ease with the cards is still impressive.  There are some tricks I still can't figure out, but that's what makes him a great magician.  All these people that criticize him are bogus or jealous.  One aspiring magician said that Blaine was hurting Magic, I feel that he lifted it to a new level and made it fun and popular again.  One person said that if you call the DVD magic then you might as well call Star Wars magic.  That's silly because Blaine rarely uses editing techniques and the magic that does not use it is still incredible.  The truth is that everyone that was impressed was real, maybe he didn't show us exactly what he showed them, but he impressed them somehow.  It's worth buying.  You'll impress all your friends.",1072828800,8,1429,4.2835820895522385
1697810,5,B0000640VL,"My family bought this DVD a year ago.  We've been showing to friends and family and everytime we watch, we are still amazed with the ease and flair that David Blaine displayed at each illusion. Some can be disturbing for younger kids like the trick with the chicken's head.  But mostly sets you at the edge of your seat and holding your breath at each move.
A must have if you are an illusion and magic lover!",1070668800,,409,4.298701298701299
1697811,5,B0000640VL,"David Blaine is extremely watchable and will completely blow your mind with the magic he performs. Despite doing a lot of card tricks (probably some of the best you will ever see mind you) the variety of tricks he performs will truely amaze you.
I'm sure he could start religions after some of his performances - the people are so engaged. It's interesting to note that some people believe that he is spiritually gifted, or some kind of guru. Although he will leave you doubting the laws of science, he is still mortal and just an illusionist, albeit also one of the best in the world. Due to his street performances he can't use any fancy props, which makes you wonder even more how he is able to achieve such amazing effects. If you knew however, it wouldn't be hardly as entertainin.
If you love magic (and let's face it, who doesn't?) you certainly won't be disappointed if you buy this DVD and I guarantee you will want to show all your friends.",1067040000,4,950,4.497109826589595
1697812,5,B0000640VL,David Blaine's Fearless is the best street magic DVD ever.  If you like street magic in general or just David Blaine you should definitely buy this DVD.  If you are the kind of person who likes stage magic with big props and tons of setup that really takes away from the illusion then this is not the DVD for you.  The only thing I could ever negatively say is that I which that it was longer.,1059436800,2,393,4.144736842105263

I purchased David Copperfields' Illusions DVD last year and it does stand a chance to this new young phenominom.  Although I was not personally present while David entertained people, I saw with my own eyes, this guy lift off the ground on several occations and it is absolutly incredible.  I am, what one would call a pretty normal person but like many people, I beleive in UFO's and I beleive this guy has something to do with another existance. Perhaps, he was abducted by Aliens and they gave him this special gift, I don't know, but I do know that he has to be the first human being with the potetial to learn how to fly without out help.

1697831,5,B0000640VL,"You may have caught some of ""street magician"" David Blaine's act on his TV specials that had limited runs. Not too worry; ""David Blaine: Fearless"" gathers them all up, and throws them all onto one DVD, and then some. You can generally find this DVD priced the same as ""discount"" DVDs, so you won't be paying the normal $20 plus that DVDs command.
Blaine's amazing tricks are super-cool but wouldn't have held their own displayed merely in a Vegas showroom; it's the who and where that makes this DVD special. Blaine often performs his tricks up close and with plenty of audience participation, to an extremely diverse set of people. He bites a quarter in half and spits it back to make it whole in front of some LA street thugs. He performs his famous levitation at the Dallas Cowboys training camp, sending Deion Sanders running, his wits barely intact. He pulls various ""pick a card"" tricks on a pair of grandmothers sitting on a bench, despite their initial declaration that they're not into magic tricks. A bunch of soccer girls at a rest stop scream with glee when makes a name appear out of ash.
Blaine even ventures into a remote South American jungle, where an tribe that has been mostly isolated from civilization serves as the challenge; the only way he can communicate with them is magic, but will ""pick a card"" mean anything to them or impress a culture with no concept of quarters, Aces or Spades? Blaine adapts and amazes them by squeezing drinkable amounts of water from random places or making a ball multiply within a closed fist. He does this again with other journeys to foreign areas.
Many of Blaine's tricks are true head-scratchers that will leave even the most cynical viewer amused. I've already described a significant amount of his simpler tricks, so I'll leave the rest for the DVD to show, including an act that is more endurance than magic: fighting hypothermia and mental breakdowns as he remains encased in an ice prison on a busy sidewalk for a couple of days.
He has a different sort of charisma; he's so laid back but you still get the sense that he truly treats magic as an art, not as an attempt to hoodwink you; but at the same time he isn't so overly serious that you can associate with him.
This is a great DVD to have; magic is an all-genre, all-gender thing. You can pop ""Fearless"" in anytime at any setting, be it a small gathering, a big party, or in your portable DVD player while waiting for your flight at the airport. There's very little filler material, which is a good thing; they've packed in as much material as they can.

1697832,5,B0000640VL,"Parlor tricks or sheer sorcery? Who's to say ? One thing can be sure is that Mr. Blaine has probably done his research/homework into the psychology of the human mind ! This is not to also dismiss that he may be onto something that the average ""normal"" human has not tapped into (after all, we only use a small percentage of our brains). One noteworthy aspect of Blaine's nonchalant and casual attitude is that he does not put on a Las Vegas or a flashy David Copperfield production (now, those are distractions that probably aid those tricks well).  Still, this DVD is and incredible and highly entertaining piece of magical history...Just as entertaining are the dumbfounded reactions by the people on the streets he performs the magic for; Even utilizing some of their personal and precious belongings. How does he do it ? I don't wanna know...that's what makes Fearless fun...you just don't want to know...Amazing stuff to make viewers think, though...",1053734400,4,955,4.895061728395062
1697833,5,B0000640VL,"UPDATE: October 2004, The $100,000.00 has been found. David Blaine's Challenge has been solved as of March 20, 2004. Now it can be said.  In this DVD, begins a black & white film with David Blaine and several subliminal images.  There is one important clue (the address numbers) in this film  that would have lead to the gold orb inside the hollow stone and the ultimate $100,000.00. David Blaine filmed this video right where the ""Treasure"" was buried.
 This was part of the ""Blaine's Challenge"" contest. if you would have read David Blaine's book, solve the puzzles, figured out the clues in the book, found the map and location, called the phone number, the street address, the bridge, the stone, all lead to the $100,000.00.  David Blaine handed the winner the $100,000.00 himself.
  I had not read Blaine's book until just this week (October 2004) and did not know all the details of the contest, but I had seen the video and knew of the contest and had wondered if David Blaine was making clues in the video. David Blaine gave out one additional important clue on ""Larry King Live"". David claimed that the clue put you there. The eventual winner said he did not have a copy of the book nor a copy of the DVD. But did watch ""Larry King Live"".
  I did do some heavy thinking myself when I saw ""Visiting...With Huell Howser"" on television recently and he showed the locations in Laurel Canyon, Califronia, in a very private, exclusive community.
My original review:
 The short, scratchy mysterious black & white film  has subliminal images. In order of appearance: David Blaine's eyes by left lion, black circle, shadow of Blaine on balcony (or small image of Blaine), image of a small Blaine near a doorway near bottom of stairs, another small image of Blaine behind left bottom of stairs behind rock pillar, face of David Blaine to the right while Blaine is in mid-air, quick shot of Blaine disappeared, scene changes to Blaine walking down rock stairs, subliminal to the right is hand holding a fan of cards, Ace of Spades appears on front of Blaine's coat, Jack of Spades appears under right lion statue, Blaine's eyes between David and the right lion, between David and right lion the face of Harry Houdini, another picture of Harry Houdini as if standing with Blaine. Then Blaine will do a trick for you. I got hooked on David Blaine when I saw his television special on the ABC Network. I was channel-surfing when I saw this man do the levitation trick. Then I saw the street magic. David Blaine is original. David Blaine is unique. David Blaine is real. ABC Network is wise to let David Blaine have specials to air for his talent and to entertain us. I will watch every special David Blaine does and I hope he is a longtime tradition for the ABC Network. When you press ""Play"", you can see 1 hour and 49 minutes of highlights from three of David Blaine specials. However, if you would like to see all three of his specials in its entirety, go to ""Archives"".
 In the ""Archives"": DAVID BLAINE STREET MAGIC--David Blaine's very first ABC Network TV Special. May 19, 1997. Special Guest: Leonardo DiCaprio. Here it runs 31 minutes.
 DAVID BLAINE MAGIC MAN--His second ABC Network special. It runs 37 minutes.
 BLAINE-FROZEN IN TIME--A Mega-Event! His third ABC Network special was originally shown live. During the re-run, they added unseen footage. This runs 40 minutes and without most of the news reporter live coverage.
 Also in the ""Archives"", is nine minutes of ""Unseen Blaine"" that are eight tricks that didn't make it in the television specials. Also newspaper articles from The New York Times from November 28, 29, 30 and December 1, 2000.
 Easter Egg #1. In the ""Main Menu"", if you click on David Blaine's eyes when they are red, they change to green. David Blaine will let you participate in a magic trick only for you. By the way, you can play this magic trick over again, pick a different card you see and David will still pick the right card!
  Easter Egg #2.  Go to ""Archives"", make it so by clicking until no underlines appear at all or just let the scene play though three times.  The letters will start to fade.  David will open his eyes and tell you to get a deck of cards.  He will wait.  Then he will do a trick for you while you are holding the cards.
  Easter Egg #3. Also in ""Archives"", instead of selecting, click your ""right"" button.  A white heart will appear on David's forehead.  Now click ""enter"" and the heart turns black.  He will show how he was preparing for the ""Pillar"" event in 2003.",1052265600,3,4527,4.610972568578553
1697834,5,B0000640VL,"David Blaine - ""Fearless"" is a must have for anyone who has the slightest interest in Magic. His magic is up close and this DVD clearly shows himself as one of the worlds greatest magicians.  There is plenty of footage and nonstop action.  Each trick will leave you shaking your head in amazement.  His tricks will never get old and this DVD will make an outstanding addition to anybody's DVD collection to watch over and over again.
For the true David Blaine fans I recommend purchasing his book ""Mysterious Stranger"" along with this video.  In the book he reveals how hid did a couple, not all, of the tricks on this DVD.  It also reveals how he got into magic and how he begame the man he is today.",1044316800,6,701,4.403100775193798
1697835,5,B0000640VL,David Blaine is really fun to watch.  He does some really creative and neat stuff.  Even tho he advertises street magic as his signature stuff but I would really like to see this guy progress further by doing more than card tricks as the bulk of his magic.  Hes definately a cool entertainer and has so much potential in the future.,1043020800,,332,4.409836065573771
1697836,5,B0000640VL,"Mr. Blaine is unhuman. He is unnatural. Let's get real, he isn't either of those things. What he is, is extremely talented. I don't know how he does the things that he does, but there is a way. Maybe he is magical, whatever the case my be, this dvd has provided hours upon hours of entertaining friends, and I've never got sick of watching it. It's great inviting new friends over that have never experienced Mr. Blaine's magic, and just watching their reactions to the show. He does all his magic in public, no stage, no lighting tricks. It's all him. A must have for anyone that loves, or even likes, magic.",1037750400,5,609,4.446428571428571
1697837,1,B0000640VL,"I have seen much of Blaine's Magic on TV.  I have seen him on many Talk Shows and News Reports.  But the reason I bought this DVD was because I wanted to see the ""extra"" stuff the DVD had to offer.  The unseen stuff.  All in all, after watching the DVD, I had the same feeling about him as I did before seeing the DVD which is the following.  Although he does use some sleight of hand that a magician would use for some of the magic tricks, a lot is accomplished by other kinds of trickery.  Without going into detail on how his ""magic"" or ""endurance"" performances are done, I will just say this.  If you like Star Wars & ET or George Lucas & Steven Speilberg then this DVD is for you.  Because that is how certain ""major"" feats of endurance & magic are accomplished on this DVD, with camera tricks, editing, stooges, etc.  There is a great thing about Street Magic, also known as close-up magic that large-scale illusions just do not have.  When you think about the popular magicians like David Copperfield, Lance Burton, Siegfried and Roy, and Penn & Teller, they all do large-scale stage illusions.  But there is one thing about all of them, they create magic in every show infront of hundreds to thousands or people a night.  If anyone ever runs into blaine ask him to levitate and see how far he really gets off the floor.  Magic is a great thing when it is used in the right way, by the right magician.  If you consider this a ""magic"" DVD then you should also consider all of the other movies in your collection with camera tricks and special effects ""magic"" DVD's.  I guess he is a good performer, but only on DVD...",1036454400,8,1623,4.3455149501661126
1697838,5,B0000640VL,"If you have never seen David Blaine and like to see the most incredible magic (if you can call it that) than you are sure to love Blaine's Fearless. He takes you through his three specials as well as never-before-seen footage and you are amazed at each turn and feat.
  If you have seen some of his previous work than you really need to add this piece to your collection and continue to be amazed at David's gift of Illusion. I used to think that he was very quick and well-versed but now I believe that he has a true gift and the things that he is able to do are not explainable by simple visual imagery.
  If you are a doubter than I encourage you to pick this up and ask yourself, ""how does he do it?"" - you will be amazed, I was.",1031961600,2,733,4.0344827586206895
1697839,5,B0000640VL,"I saw bits and pieces about david Blaine in the news from his NY stunt. So I decided to buy this one. Now understand I am one of the people who love magic. People go to Las Vegas to gamble I go to watch the magic shows. After seeing this DVD I was very impressed with the level of skills David has. Although he does many card tricks that are stunning and unexplainable and he does them with people on the street and celebrities like the dallas cowboys, He also does some supernatural stuff. If there is paranormal or spiritual tricks where physics don't apply then this guy does them.
I watched it many times and gave it to my sister to watch with her kids(14, 12 and 9) and they like it so much they won't return it to me. This is a great product for the money.",1031443200,4,762,4.120805369127517
1697850,5,B0000640VL,"When I first seen heard about this movie I thought, oh okay another one of those cheap magic movies again. But when I seen it I couldn't get my jaw off the floor! I was all in awww! Nothing but amazement in this movie. I've seen it over 20 times! You gotta watch it! Now, I'm just in LOVE with DAVID BLAINE!!!",1029628800,,309,4.0

We've watched it and talked about it for days... truly a collector items.. a great film for parties!...

1697852,5,B0000640VL,"I find it hard to come to terms with the inexplicable magic of david blaine, especially when he made that fellow win money on thelottery ticket,or the pigeon ) then some comparison can be made with the arrival of Jesus doing miracles. David should use his gifts (if they are real) to  cure and to alleviate so much suffering in the world instead of promoting entertainment.",1029110400,2,373,4.651515151515151
1697853,4,B0000640VL,"The first time you watch it it's amazing...... in fact it is..... but this guy does the same 5 or 6 tricks to like 6 different people..... and...after the second time....well, you've seen it already.... still, it's a great buy...... a must see anyway....",1023408000,5,254,4.795454545454546
1697854,5,B0000640VL,"It seems like David Blaine does standard old-school tricks like biting the quarter in half or sleight-of-hand card switches in order to make his more mind-blowing illusions seem a little less spooky. I have read the editorials by magicians debunking some of his more pedestrian tricks but I haven't read any plausible explanations on how he managed to aid the guy in buying the winning $1600 lottery ticket (don't tell me they cut out the footage of hundreds of losing tickets) or managed to drop a woman's ring into a sewer grate and then find it minutes later inside a tiny liquor bottle on the ground behind the crowd of onlookers. There are at least a dozen of these ""tricks"" on the DVD that are absolutely astonishing. He is an unworldly character and the video is an outstanding document of his abilities.",1023148800,16,811,4.71830985915493
1697855,5,B0000640VL,"If you want to be amazed by David's talents for a little under 2 hours get this DVD. It's none stop in your face excitement from beginning to end.

1697856,4,B0000640VL,"David Blaine demostrates great execution of magic tricks and mixes very well peoples reaction on the street to create a ""mystic"" atmosphere. As with all magic tricks, it's all illusion (check the web and you'll find plenty of sites with spoilers of his tricks), but never the less, his execution is flawless. Doing a DVD is risky for him, since you can follow very closely each trick using a frame by frame. So if you love magic, buy it and don't bother to try to look for an explanation.",1023148800,5,488,4.49438202247191
1697857,5,B0000640VL,"In a word, David Blaine is neater than front row seats to a Barry Manilow concert.  The tricks he does in this video are mind blowing and should be banned from any country that does not have it's own currency.  This DVD was out of sight! I am not sure how he does all of his feats of trickery but believe me, I think that anyone who can pull of some of the neato stuff he does should be given their own DVD.  He also have very dreamy eyes that seem to look right though you, to the chick that is standing behind you... Spooky!",1022112000,2,526,3.9904761904761905
1697858,5,B0000640VL,Absolutely amazing!  I saw Street Magic on TV a few months back and rushed to my computer to find out more about David Blaine.  I preordered this DVD and have waited patiently for its arrival.  Wow!  It is even better than I could have imagined.  I can't wait to tell all my friends and family about David's ability and skills.  Just buy this DVD.  You will not be disappointed.  I think I'll buy a second copy to give to my sister for her birthday.,1022025600,6,449,4.261904761904762
