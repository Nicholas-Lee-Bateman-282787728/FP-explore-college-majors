8182193,5,B00004TL7X,"I loved this movie. It definitely seems to be as low budget as possible while still being watchable. The frame story is terrible filmed and acted, but the two segments, especially ""The Box"", are really good and imaginative and surprisingly liberal. The series focused primarily on women, the first one was about prostitutes but they weren't buffoons and the film makers didn't seem to treat them like they were meant to be sex symbols or anything. Which, considering it's a super low budget 90s horror film, you'd kinda figure the opposite. I get why people would hate it, and definitely don't expect anything even B quality. But I gotta say, I'd prefer this over a lot of the regular grade horror films. Things 2 is pretty good as well, but this one certainly takes the cake. The creature effects are really neat too. It just seems like a lot of love and heart was put into this movie, and being made in the early 90s, if anything it makes for an interesting watch.",1523318400,,966,4.589595375722543

8182195,4,B00004TL7X,"A fun Shot-On-Video (SOV) anthology horror movie from the early '90s.  Has 2 stories and a wraparound.  Stars Courtney Lecara in the 2nd story, who also stars in Tim Ritter's ""Killing Spree"".  Worth a watch if you like SOV movies.",1519430400,,230,4.7
8182196,3,B00004TL7X,"This is a Kool film. It is really offbeat. Two weird tales of terror that could have been in a EC comic. Independent films like this are what making the search for obscure B movies worthwhile . I loved the Outer Limits like weird creature too.  I liked the first tale the best .  For a low budget film it has great imagination. Violence, gore, nudity, and weird creatures. It moves fast too. Fun for any movie night.",1405209600,,416,4.32051282051282
8182197,1,B00004TL7X,"This is a weird movie, strange plot, it was different. Revenge on a husbands mistress by his wife, and evil mayor of a small town who has a strange creature he uses to keep the town under his control, and a wife who wants to escape her husbands beatings. All three are intertwined and its just weird how they all happen. The acting is low budget.",1359849600,,346,4.257575757575758
8182198,1,B00004TL7X,"This movie shamefully is using the Credits for THINGS 1989 even though it is a film by the same name from 1993. Do Not be fooled - Amber Lynn, Barry J. Gillis, Doug Bunston and others from the movie THINGS (1989) are not in this movie. If you are a fan of THINGS 1989 or looking to buy it, avoid at all cost.",1218067200,8,308,3.9047619047619047
