1834292,5,B00008AOVG,"The movie is about a crazy physco killer that dies then comes back as a snow man and wreaks havoc on a little town. I have to be honest with you this movie SUCKS! It's horrible that it's just hilarious. His one liners like ""Well it aint F**ckin Frosty"" and ""The worlds most pissed off snow cone"" are classic. It's like the horror/slasher/comedy version of Godzilla. It's a terrible movie but you can't help but love it.",1142467200,16,419,4.454545454545454
1834293,2,B00008AOVG,"While the script idea for a serial killer snowman is a novel idea, the execution of the story, which possibly could have been on a par with Shaun of the Dead in its wit and visual humor, falls short. Whenever you try to combine the elements of comedy and horror, you have to decide where to take the story: should it be a parody, a satire, tongue in cheek, or a mix of these approaches? What visual framing will convey your choices, and how will the characterizations and actions move the story along to highlight them?

Beginning with the opening narration, an inappropriately told bedtime story to a young girl (at least the voice was supposed to be that of a young girl), the camera moves slowly across ornaments on a Christmas tree, pausing to show the film's credits written on each one (a clever but drawn out setup). This narration sets up the story, sort of, for Jack Frost, and we cut to him being conveyed to his execution in a van aptly titled with Troma-like subtlety ""State Executional Transfer Vehicle.""  The ensuing truck collision with the aptly titled ""Genetic Research"" van shows the miniscule budget the movie was shot with, and Jack is now conveniently melted into the snow, where his molecular do-hickies merge with the stuff to create the killer snowman.

Cut to Snowmonton, site of the annual snowman contest and...hey, wait a minute, there's that lack of budget again. No snow! Well, okay, a few very small piles of fake snow lying around, but the snowman contest does look pretty pitiful, and awfully fake. This would have been a funny scene if intended as such, but I doubt the script was that sophisticated.

The first murder is done off camera, and the victim's discovery is framed pretty well and is humorous: the camera angle from behind the dead man's frozen head, looks up at the three police officers looking down at the body in the rocking chair, with one of them annoyingly rocking it back and forth with his foot. Another killing later in the story has a woman viciously murdered by Jack, using a Christmas tree, Christmas tree lights, and ornaments. The scene is vicious and not particularly handled well, so falls between intended to be funny, but not really funny. The camera angle here mimics the first murder, and while clever, loses a lot of its intended humor due to the way the woman's murder was handled. The killings become more vindictive and bloody, as the film becomes more gore oriented, and the characterizations lose the humorous aspect they were meant to convey because the balance of parody, satire, and tongue in cheek are lost to the stereotypical escalating violence.

In a convenient plot device to make Jack more mobile--he can change from snow to water as needed-he can enter houses, and commit a particularly distasteful rape and murder that completely changes the tone of the story. While the scene must have looked clever on paper, it defies logic and thematic sense, and moves the film into more serious horror-head territory (which would have been great if the rest of the film had joined it).

The ensuing scenes, which include the sheriff's penchant for losing keys, and, hey, where did all those aerosol cans and hair dryers come from?! combined with the highly unlikely denouement involving the anti-freeze filled truck bed, are incongruous with the more serious tone of Jack Frost's killing spree.

While this is not a good film, it still contains some elements worth watching, and also provides a primer in what you should not do when attempting a humorous horror film for budding scriptwriters.",1135123200,13,3566,4.807504078303426
1834294,4,B00008AOVG,"My interest first came to this film when I was flicking through the pages of my Fangoria magazine, and  there was an intervew with the Director, but the article mentioned 'Jack Frost' and an unknown Shannon Elizabeth getting raped by a killer snowman.

I thought ''What the hell'', but was interested. Then I saw it at my local video store and I didn't grab it right away, I kept thinking ''This film is going to be bad, but I wanna see it''. So I finally hired it and the first time one watches it, you think ''Oh this is soooo bad, but funny in a dumb way. But there is something about it. Then I watched it again and I got more into it, by the third viewing I was totally into in. Funny how that happens with some films.

This movie rocks. It actually is a good, interesting, funny film if you just embrace what is happening and the humour along with it.

The people who made this vile movie,must think that rape is something to laugh at and to find funny. Well,there is NOTHING humorous about rape. I say this,because in one scene it shows a woman being violenty raped by the killer snowman's ""carrot"".This is the most digusting thing I have ever seen in a ANY movie. The rest of the film is garbage too. Some of the most gruesome deaths I have ever seen in my life during a horror film. Overall,this movie is below low. It's a downright disgrace. I would rather watch the old time horror flicks over this any day. Such as Frankenstein,The Mummy or maybe Wolfman. Now THOSE were good horror flicks. Not immoral trash like this. I would also watch Micheal Keaton's Jack Frost movie over this vile mess too!",1359676800,,861,4.561290322580645

This is one movie that has to be seen for the laughs/puns to work. Also, this one is great compared to the one starring Michael Keaton and Kelly Preston. This has the best puns in movie history and great acting for some of the silly dialogue they have to say. You can tell that Scott MacDonald is trying be imitate Brad Dourif's voice when he yells ""I'll find a way!!!"" He is still great dispite that. I can't say much more.

1834305,4,B00008AOVG,"A serial killer by the name of Jack Frost (natch) is being transported to where he will be executed at the stroke of midnight. Unfortunately, the blinding snowstorm during the trip causes the transfer vehicle to crash into a genetic research truck chock full of an experimental acid. The collision exposes the psychopathic killer to the acid, dissolving his body and mixing his DNA with snow to create... yes... a killer snowman! This will not bode well for the residents of nearby Snomonton County (of course the first syllable of Snomonton is pronounced ""snow""). Perhaps the local sheriff, who was responsible for capturing Jack Frost (albeit, when in human form), can save the day once again. Since Jack is capable of altering his molecular structure, we could rationalize how the mutant serial killer could form into the shape of a snowman. But then we might ask, ""Why?"". Is it the seasonal and symbolic thing to do? Oh wait, all that constitutes logic, which this crazy Christmas chiller has little of. But then, we as the viewers weren't expecting something of sound mind, body and snow, er, soul, anyway. Outside of the possible annoyances of Jack's corny one-liners and some whacked out holiday background music that sometimes sounds... well, Hawaiian, you should get some enjoyment out of this horror flick.

1834310,4,B00008AOVG,"Ok for those that think this is going to be a super scary slasher with a viscious looking snowman like the cover, think again.

It is story about a serial killer ""Jack Frost"" recently captured by the local sheriff, hand cuffed and on route for his execution.  When suddenly a blizzard occurs and visibility becomes impossible and they collide with a genetics experiment truck.  Soon the genetics truck explodes and the chemical inside melts Jack into the snow.  Soon the abonimable killer is on the loose seeking his revenge on the sheriff that put him into this predictament and of course killing anyone in his path.

Sounds OK right?  Well it is a very watchable movie.  Especially for anyone that likes movies that you can't believe were ever made.  More comical then scary.  Jack is far from the appearance the cover depicts.  What you get is a guy in a puffy white snowman outfit with large white oven mit hands.  What adds to the hilarity is the way people battle the abonimable killer.  Hair dryers, aerosol cans and lighters, heaters, etc. fill the movie with extra laughs.  In fact take out the strange rape scene and this film in my book gets five stars.

Overall, a fun movie that is a must buy for anyone that likes the cheesy campy films of the 80s.  Belongs next to Killer Klowns and Tomatoes on the shelf.",1217289600,2,1320,4.581196581196581

I even bought it but never popped it in until recently. This time around my opinion changed big time. I'm not sure what I was thinking when I originally thought it was so great. It really was awful. I am a big fan of B movies but this was just too goofy. I wasn't expecting much, but this didn't do anything for me. I think it's the best when a movie really tries to be serious but is too ridiculous to be anything but funny. But when a movie knows it's so bad they try to make it funny is a different story. As much as I'd love to love a movie about a killer snowman, I just can't. I'd pass on this if you have the chance.",1203638400,2,753,3.896103896103896
1834312,2,B00008AOVG,"We, Sid the Elf, have been very excited about kicking off the Christmas B season and decided to open up with Jack Frost. Many years ago Sid saw Jack Frost when it was a new release at his local video store and really enjoyed it's straight to VHS goodness. Unfortunately it did not stand the test of time like we expected. I'm not sure exactly what went wrong? Horror B used to be the tops. Now it is hard to even sit through a full viewing. I guess Sid has just matured and really needs some sweet explosions and neck snappings to get his bull running. After viewing timeless works of art like ""Total Recall"", ""Predator,"" and ""Out For Justice"" Jack Frost just seems obsolete.

As much as we would like to, we just can't recommend Jack Frost. It seems as if this one started the trend of horror movies that know they are so bad they have to try to make them funny, which has single handedly ruined the genre.",1197158400,,907,4.304093567251462

1834314,4,B00008AOVG,"The 1997 straight to video release of Jack Frost (incorrectly searched as Jack Frost, the PG rating with Michael Keaton, Grr) is an unrecognised piece of cult status classic, simple plot is as follows: a serial killer gets sent to blah blah of some town, crashes with a car full of genetic chemicals and dissolves into the snow and becomes an unstoppable machine, only one thing kills it and it's A---------- (you guess the rest), what makes this seperated from the pack is the killer can come apart and regenerate again. Christopher Allport (Sleepaway Camp, also good independant horror movie) is the Sheriff of the little town and his acting is bearable but towards sketchy, Shannon Elizabeth makes an appearance which sparked a huge answer to the film's probelm, who's the target audience?, Me? i prefer the one liners, the brief gore moments and blood! (sick aren't i?) All in all, it's a good little popcorn movie with a reasonable budget but does need to belong in any horror movie collection.

1834316,2,B00008AOVG,"Although often touted as a horror comedy, the most amusing aspect of this 1997 direct-to-video clunker is the fact that it is often confused with its saccharine family-flick namesake, a commensurately clunky and similarly themed Michael Keaton vehicle released in theaters the following year. Interestingly, the titular character of each film is a snowman that has somehow come to life. However, those planning a nice evening with the youngsters will be in for quite a shock if they purchase or rent the wrong movie. The snowy dude in Keaton's film is a benevolent father figure who wants to help out his real-life family; the icy hombre in the 1997 horror flick is animated by the soul of an escaped convict with a penchant for rape and murder.

Outside of the amusing thought of 1997's JACK FROST getting an accidental showing at a kiddie party, this film has very little to offer. The special FX are amateurish, the script is so inane that it is nearly impossible to suspend one's disbelief for the duration, and much of the acting is horrid. While some films can be admired for their cheesiness--Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD (1981) comes immediately to mind--JACK FROST falls way beneath even THAT standard. Writer-director Michael Cooney seems unable to decide if he wants to spoof the horror genre--there are scenes that mimic horror cliches but few, if any, that parody or satirize them--or simply make, a la Wes Craven's A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (1984), a scary film with humorous characters and an amusing premise. The film vacillates between both styles without gaining sufficient footing in either, and the result is a slushy thematic jumble that is neither scary nor entertaining.

JACK FROST is not without a few near-redeeming qualities, however. There are lots of amusing Python-esque puns and jokes sprinkled throughout the film, the kind of verbal gags that make you simultaneously chuckle and...well, GAG. And this film also marks the cinematic debut of gorgeous actress Shannon Elizabeth, who here has some, ah, revealing moments with the eponymous snowman. Unfortunately, these elements do not elevate the film enough to make it worth wasting an hour-and-a-half of one's life.

Don't be fooled by the artwork on the DVD's packaging--that cool skull made of snow does not appear in the film. In truth, 1997's JACK FROST is an ice-cold stinker that few discerning horror fans will want to add to their collections.",1168214400,6,2426,5.029850746268656

7981378,4,B00008AOVG,"This movie is so bad that it's good. It's a B movie. This movie is fun and entertaining. Don't take it too seriously! Have fun with it.
However, if you expect to have a killer plot that aligns properly/makes sense, you will be strongly disappointed. Before you watch the movie, you should read the synopsis or watch the trailer to know what you're getting into because I browsed through the reviews and it seemed like some people had high expectations for this movie. Before you watch the movie, I suggest you look at the synopsis and watch the movie trailer. This movie provides a few cheap laughs and has a penchant for absurdity.

The trailer comes off cheesy and the killer snowman said a few one liners. The acting wasn't really good either. In any case, the premise of the movie was about a killer snowman. It follows the plot of a truck transporting serial killer Jack Frost to his execution. Trouble arises due to the truck bumping into a genetics truck. This causes Jack's body to mutate and combine with the snow. Thus, forming a killer snowman. Jack is believed to be dead and that his body melted away. But this is not the case as he became a killer snowman and tries to get revenge from the man who caught him. That plot itself doesn't seem like something you can take seriously.

It was meant to be funny and satrical. The straight faced delivery of the scenes were enjoyable. Plus, it was fun watching the cast play it off with such a ridiculous premise. The special effects were amateurish, but I believe that the quality made the movie great in its way. The acting was not very good and the plot was insane. However, I think that was to be expected. The movie does deliver what it promised in the synposis/trailer. Jack Frost does murder alot of people in bizzare homicidal ways. For instance, he used a sled to decapitate a teenage boy, stuffed a woman's mouth with Christmas ornaments and then punched her in the face, and etc.  There isn't much else to be gained from watching it, other than for a few laughs.",1439856000,,2029,4.523160762942779
7981379,4,B00008AOVG,"At the beginning a serial killer is on route to be executed.  Same time as an expiramental chemical was being shipped.  The chemical was part of a genetic research project.  It was designed to bond human DNA to inert material.  That would allow a healthy gene pool to be preserved indefinately, so that human race could survive even in the event of a global catastrophy.

When Jack's transport collided with the chemical truck, Jack was drenched in the chemical.  Jack's entire body liquefied, and bonded with the snow.  The snow didn't just absorb Jack's DNA, it also absorbed his memories, personality, and his entire mind.  Jack was reborn as a Killer Snowman.

Jack headed for the Small Town, where he'd been captured.  He killed a few people to test his new form, and then enjoyed terrorizing the town.  Once he'd had his fill of sadistic pleasure he came for the Sheriff, who'd arrested him.

Jack survives bullets, explosions, and being completely evaporated.  Finally they realize that his snow body could be dissolved in Anti-Freeze.

Now, Jack has returned to terrorize the small mountain town of Snowmonton while seeking revenge against the sheriff that locked him away. JACK FROST has all the makings of a great B-movie: a ridiculous villain, awful humor, and a wintery holiday setting. Wise crackin' Jack is given only the worst one-liners as he spreads his bloody holiday cheer around town. The actors add to the absurdity by playing everything perfectly straight, despite being chased by a killer snowman made out of fluffy white Christmas flock. Director Michael Cooney does earn a few cheap laughs along the way, although most will be laughing at the movie, and not with it. As far as murders go, the film packs in quite a number of ridiculous deaths, including a decapitation by sled, an icicle impalement, and an axe to the face (not what you would expect). Look for Shannon Elizabeth in an early starring role.
