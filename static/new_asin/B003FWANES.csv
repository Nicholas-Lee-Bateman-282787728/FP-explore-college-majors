8396235,1,B003FWANES,This film was retarded if you need it for national lampoons buy it but don't watch !,1457913600,,84,4.0
8396236,5,B003FWANES,"I loved it! But then I made it. 300 people, full costume, full original score and shot at Universal Studios! Love it or hate it, if nothing else this is a lesson for fellow filmmakers on how to make $1.5 million worth of movie for under $68k. The fact that American Cinematographer dedicated five pages to it and it was screened at festivals around the world should just offer a little more reassurance.  Hey, no film is for everyone, but at the very least this film represents an almost impossible achievement in production.",1417219200,,525,4.645161290322581
8396237,1,B003FWANES,This is a stupid movie and it's short. You'll spend more time thinking about buying the movie than actually watching it. The extras are a joke. It was bought as a gag gift and I've had more enjoyment from giving it than watching the movie and it's because of this that I don't regret buying it.,1412640000,,294,4.267857142857143
