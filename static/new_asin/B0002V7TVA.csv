8032513,4,B0002V7TVA,Joki on hyv elokuva.  The River is a good movie.,1469750400,,48,3.8
8032514,3,B0002V7TVA,"Extremely interesting as insight into modern Finnish tastes and mores (on the whole quite civilized though sometimes all too familiar).  Also some great shots of a mostly rural setting (nevertheless, why miss an opportunity to brag up what must be unusual and gorgeous countryside?).  Unfortunately the distraught mother's near suicide, while riveting, is not enough to pull the many stories together.  BTW Amazon makes one acutely aware of how many books, films, and other media use the same title!!",1459900800,,500,5.30379746835443
8032515,1,B0002V7TVA,"Had thought I had selected a different ""River"" so it was a mistake. I began it but had other things to do that were higher priority.",1454544000,,132,4.115384615384615

8032517,5,B0002V7TVA,"i thought this movie was fantastic.  the characters, the depth, the humanity were all on display.  thank you for hosting this movie Amazon Prime!",1442016000,,145,5.0
8032518,2,B0002V7TVA,"It's not Robert Altman. Too many characters, too slow, too confusing. Flat.",1416268800,,75,5.333333333333333
8032519,5,B0002V7TVA,"A fantastic film that shows how, in our search for love, our decisions start a deeper process (both unconscious and conscious) that determines our experiences in life.  It also shows, through the poignant snippets of the lives of the people who inhabit this town, how they cross each others' paths and have the potential to make a difference.  Lovely glimpse into Finland.",1383523200,,372,4.983870967741935
8032520,5,B0002V7TVA,"that's the quote from Variety that's on the DVD box, and I couldn't agree more. The acting in this film is top notch. The film follows a range of characters over the course of one autumn day in Finland. Included among them are a gay couple trying to keep their affair secret, an adulterous wife, and a young mother contemplating suicide. The film manages to portray all of its characters in a very real and believable way. Unlike some ""day in the life"" films, this one manages to be an ordinary day with some very extraordinary events. Two thumbs up!!!",1098835200,2,552,4.53
8032521,2,B0002V7TVA,"...in a bad way.  ""The River"" (or ""Joki"") takes a painfully familiar formula (ex. Robert Altman's ""Short Cuts,"" as if we needed another), sets it in Finland, and leaves its viewer stranded.  The film is structured around a woman who appears to be attempting suicide by drowning her and her baby in a river; the side-stories follow from there.  Unfortunately, the ""we're-all-connected"" theme of the film feels less genuine than even the the most uninspired of the subgenre.  The film feels more like a bunch of half-assembled ideas patched together solely because the director didn't know how to conclude (or leave interestingly inconclusive) each story.  The sad part is that the film is far from dull; yet your endurance through the entirity may seem futile by the end-credits.",1098144000,4,778,5.046875
