A man talks about a room. He enters, another man attacks him, but falls. Is this a nightmare? He awakes in his bed. But there are two thumb prints on his neck! He has a strange key now. Is he going insane? Or sick? He calls in sick to his place of work - a bank. Vince Grayson isn't well, or at home. He goes to see his brother-in-law at home and explains his dream. His coworker is there. He puts an ad in the newspaper for a house with a mirrored room. The next day they go for a car ride in the country and stop for a meal. Vince is still upset, he rejects Betty. Then it rains so they return. Vince remembers this area. They turn off the road and come to a big mansion. There is a key under the mat, so they enter to find a warm dry place. They start a fire in the fireplace of this empty house. Vince finds a room like the one he dreamt about! His brother-in-law accuses him of lying.

A deputy sheriff arrives to investigate their presence. A murder was committed there last week. A burglar killed the wife while the husband was on a business trip. Vince and his brother-in-law visit the police station to learn more. Vince recognized the people in the pictures! He faints. They return home. Cliff talks to Vince in his room, then leaves. Vince opens a window and looks down. Cliff grabs him just in time! Betty will drive Lil home, Cliff will stay with Vince. They talk. Vince tells him about the man in the next room. Cliff leaves on an errand, then returns with a mans picture; he explains what happened. Cliff has a plan to clear Vince. Vince meets Mr. Belknap. Belknap talks about what he did, a confession. Can Vince be hypnotized? Can the police stop Belknap? There is a dramatic scene in a car. Can the police save Vince? There is a car chase, Belknaps car crashes. Vince is saved. The story is in the newspapers. There is a happy ending.

This is based on the story Nightmare by William Irish. Is it believable or plausible? Maybe it sounds good on paper, but showing it as a re-enactment shows its implausibility (unless you suspend belief). Some may like this story. When a wife is killed the husband is the prime suspect. I wonder why the police didn't check the husbands alibi about being in Mexico?",1489622400,,2248,4.297169811320755
