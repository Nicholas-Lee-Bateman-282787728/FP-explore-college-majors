It's so bad, you can't even enjoy it without getting a headache. Lot's of useless effects and grain, out of focus areas, camera all over he place to give you a headache and they even went as far as using stretcho vision for an effect. WTF!! The camera men and who ever edited this DVD needs to be shot. I felt like I was watching a bad MTV video instead of a live concert. You know, I would of like to had the camera stay still or focused long to watch a guitar solo.",1278201600,3,630,3.968503937007874
