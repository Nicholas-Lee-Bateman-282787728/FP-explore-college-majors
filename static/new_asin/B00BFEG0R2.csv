5614932,5,B00BFEG0R2,"MISS DECEMBER is a killer movie! It's a dark romantic comedy that will chill your bones and warm your heart! It's such a good flick... I laughed, I cried, I s*** my pants. The performances are stellar! Jensen Bucher steals the show. She is a revelation. The story is unpredictable and filled with excitement and suspense! Independent film is not always good, but this film is great! Check it out!",1360886400,4,396,4.671428571428572
8567706,2,B00BFEG0R2,A friend was in this film and that is the only reason I watched it. The film was not so thrilling although I was delighted to see my friend on the screen and want to support his work.,1490572800,,183,3.8421052631578947
8567707,4,B00BFEG0R2,"Miss December opens with a montage of murders and nude women that makes it look like a sleazy exploitation film--then the movie proper starts and it turns out to be much closer to early Hal Hartley.  Jensen Bucher plays Ari, a diner waitress who is rude to her customers, drinks too much and is in love with her best friend who is engaged to someone else.  She's lonely and bored with her life, despite her don't give a crap attitude.  Meanwhile a serial killer who has murdered one woman every month all year is prowling the city and it's December.  When a newspaper publishes a letter from the killer describing his next victim it sounds a lot like Ari, and rather than be scared like a normal person she's excited--to the horror of both her only female pal and her male boss at the diner.

If Ari really is the next victim there are two main suspects who might be the killer--her ex with a violent temper who is a photographer and tells a gallery owner who rejects his portfolio that he's working on something that isn't quite finished or the scruffy young man with the camera around his neck who suddenly starts popping up at the diner and hanging around the waitress.

Ari is the kind of person people like even though they really shouldn't and actress Jensen Bucher slips enough charm and vulnerability into her generally unpleasant character to make it believable that people might want to be with her despite her frequently off-putting behavior.  Bucher makes a pretty annoying character adorable and she's probably an actress to watch.

Miss December is filled with low-key charm and laughs but a thriller or horror movie it definitely isn't.  But if you watch Miss December you might find yourself falling in love with the foul-mouthed waitress who is so bored with her life that she welcomes the attention of a serial killer.",1386374400,,1836,4.6770186335403725
8567708,2,B00BFEG0R2,"Really not worth the money spent.  I would've been happier having rented this one, but that wasn't an option.  The film looks to be another one of those films made by a few of Kevin Smith's friends.  Jensen Bucher was great as Ari, but the plot/execution of the film was sooo poor (especially at the end of the film) that it reminded me of another Kevin Smith recommended terrible film from a few years back called Vulgar, also featuring Brian O'Halloran (Dante from Clerks).  So far this is the worst film I've seen of the Kevin Smith movie club, though it's totally possible there are worse yet in the collection.  I came to this one after seeing The Dirties, and Alter Egos, which were great!  Miss December was a pretty crappy film reminding me yet again that not everything Kevin Smith associated is great.",1383523200,,811,4.597222222222222

I thought I knew who the killer was....I was wrong.",1382486400,,111,4.55
8567710,4,B00BFEG0R2,"Good storyline, great casting and acting, flow of events, close up camera work keeps viewer with actors' feelings, liked everything about it!",1375056000,,141,5.454545454545454
8567711,1,B00BFEG0R2,"The reviews are obviously coming from people who either are part of the production team or friends with the director. Either way this a muttled mess bad acting , bad script, predictable plot and nothing redeeming to offer cinema. This is not a horror film it is a satire comedy for some one that has time to waste.",1372550400,,314,4.431034482758621
8567712,5,B00BFEG0R2,If you are a fan of indie films then this is the movie for you.  I really enjoyed the story and the twists and turns that kept me on my toes. This is the perfect dark comedy for an evening in.,1371081600,,192,3.682926829268293
8567713,1,B00BFEG0R2,"With a title like Miss December, you'd think I'd know it was like Playboy bunny murders.  I watched about 10 minutes of it.  I DO like Brian Gottfried and Corben Benson, however, and I was curious to see how they did.  The reviews, positive though they were, were written by males but I was NOT impressed with the little I saw of this one.",1370476800,,339,4.265625
8567714,5,B00BFEG0R2,"I went to this after watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mancation/dp/B009NPLCXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mancation</a>&nbsp;which stars Joey Fatone and Winnie Cooper from the Wonder Years. This film was also hilarious, but in a dark, horror-twinged sort of way. It has a nice indie feel, and the actors do a nice job bringing the story to life. Imagine that a serial killer is making hits based on the Calendar, and then you have a hot heroine who is ready to take it head on-literally. I would definitely check this out. Get your popcorn.",1369440000,4,590,5.872093023255814
8567715,5,B00BFEG0R2,This horror rom-com far exceeded my expectations. It is a thriller for the ages that defies typical archetypes seen in this genre. Well done!,1362182400,2,141,4.916666666666667
