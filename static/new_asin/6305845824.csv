7899555,4,6305845824,Its just what i expected.. Floyd is entertaining and knowledgeable on the subject.  Wish there were more than just the 8 episodes.  He is so much better than the travel guys you see on other networks these days.  I recommend Floyd even though he's still on VHS! Cheers!,1382918400,,269,4.5625
7899556,5,6305845824,"Floyd, and his companion Jonathan, seek out the wine world of France with a tongue in cheek type of attitude.  Floyd is quite humorous, especially with a couple of glasses under his belt. The English humor comes through and Jonathan, his companion side-kick, is a straight man.  He is also the one who knows his wine.
With Floyd as the 'Dummy' and Jonathan as the French Wine Institue representative, this video works.  A serious student of French wine, French wine regions and wine tasting in general would find this video informative and entertaining.
A must is to acquire each of the wines prior to the viewing of each week's show.  This makes the show much more valuable.

Floyd and Pedley provide an unsnobbery approach to the  wonders of wine from Burgundy to Champagne. It is fun and informative, but  most of all... highly intoxicating!",961027200,3,264,4.954545454545454
7899558,5,6305845824,This excellent video of the Bristish TV series 'Floyd Uncorked' is very entertaining and essential for anyone who wants a no-nonsense guide to French wines.  The video is interactive too!  All you need to do is buy the  same wines that are featured and as Floyd opens a bottle you open a bottle!  I know it's good because I produced and directed the series!,955670400,16,357,4.53125
