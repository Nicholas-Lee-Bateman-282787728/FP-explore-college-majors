7828195,3,6302629128,"PREY FOR THE HUNTER is one of the countless films whose scenario is this:  a human is suddenly placed in the position of being prey for a nasty bunch of hunters.  In this one, Todd Jensen stars as Simon, a t.v. newsman who has been stranded in war-torn Africa.  He meets up with a bunch of initially jolly hunters.  Bob, the gang's leader, played by Andre Jacobs decides to ask Jensen to participate in a hunting game, wherein paint bullets will be used as the weapon.  In return for a trip home, jensen agrees and the game begins.  However, Jacobs has a hidden agenda:  he stands to get the dibs on a defense contract if his fellow hunters meet an untimely demise.  He uses Jensen as a scapegoat to achieve this goal.

The pacing is too slow for a movie of this nature, and although Jensen has the studly demeanor of an action hero, the direction inhibits him and the rest of the cast as well.  A tricky surprise twist at the end is neat, and overall, if you like this type of movie, it's okay.  Not a classic though by any means.",1098057600,,1031,4.290155440414508
