1394501,5,B000055ZK9,"There is no doubt that Wrestlemania was a great, breath-taking ppv. But with all the publicity and advertising and commercials they got i think one or two matches could have been a little better. The hardcore match was great. mcmahon street fight was great but not really a street fight atmosphere. undertaker vs. triple h was good but the scaffolding bump helmsley took was made out of foam rubber. tlc1 was better than tlc 2 but it was still unbelievable. the title match was real good but not as good as it could have been with the 10000000 hours of hype it got. This was a great ppv no doubt. im just saying that some things didnot live up totally to all 35 days of attention they got.",986515200,,689,4.390625
1394502,5,B000055ZK9,"I like all the matches but I have to say my favorite was Chyna v.s Ivory. It's so funny! Chyna just lays on Ivory as if she was a couch! It really impressed me that the WWF came up with this great event! The first match was Y2J(Chris Jericho)v.s William Regal. Jericho finishes him off with a lionsault! Next was  Tazz/APA v.s Right to Censor. You GOT to see that Clothesline from Hell to Goodfather! It is just amazing! Then in a Triple Threat Match Kane, Rave, and Big Show all fought for the Hardcore Title. Im not a fan of Big Show so I love saying this: BIG SHOW FALLS THROUGH A WALL! You should see the impact when Kane almost Irish Whips Big Show through the screen! But its to bad he doesn't. But then Big Show and Raven fall through this glass thingy and Kane hits an amazing leg drop! Then in the match for the European title Latino Heat picks up the win when he hits Test with the belt. TLC 2 was amazing! Jeff Hardy was hanging on the belts but Christian jumps and knocks him down! And Dudley Boyz 3D Lita! And Spike Dudley comes out and does the little spring-on-their-head thingy to Christian through a table! And Jeff Hardy Swanton Bombs Ryhno AND Spike Dudley through a table! And Matt Hardy and D-Von Dudley both get smashed through 4 TABLES AT ONCE! And in the last match Stone Cold v.s The Rock, Mr. McMahon ACTUALLY HELPS STONE COLD! And later they shake hands! And in Triple H v.s The Undertaker, Triple H hits  Undertaker in the head with a sledgehammer but he still loses!",986515200,2,1495,4.316725978647687
1394503,3,B000055ZK9,"Well I caught Wrestlemania X-Seven on pay-per-view and must say that it wasn't too bad.  However it wasn't as good as it was hyped up to be over the few months leading to it.
The TLC-2 match was basically the highlight of the event and was indeed a spectacle to watch.
The gimmick battle royal was cool as it brought back some old favourites from back in the day.  However the match began and ended within 5 minutes (and that's including the introductions).
The Rock/Austin match was also very entertaining.
I will say this for it however, it was better than last year's.",986515200,,571,4.533980582524272
1394504,5,B000055ZK9,"I was there at Wrestlemania 17 and I must say this was the best show put on by the WWF since No Way Out. The Regal-Jericho match had some old school wrestling to it with Jericho coming out on top. Eddie Guerrero and Test was a solid matchup. Tazz& the Acolytes vs. Right To Censor was a good match with some confusion but overall a good match. The Hardcore Championship Triple Threat match was a hilarious and entertaining match with Rave, Kane and Big Show all giving a great performance through the back halls of the Reliant Astrodome. Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit show a great deal of technical wrestling skills in their match. Shane McMahon versus Vince McMahon was an awesome match and I must give Shane a great deal of respect to pull off the type of moves he did in this match. TLC 2 was better than Wrestlemania 2000 especially when all 3 tag teams plus their associates joined in this myraid of metal and wood. Triple H and Undertaker brought the whole Astrodome crowd to its feet with the ongoing action and the brutality and guts of both grapplers.  The Gimmick battle Royal brings in some comedy to calm the crowd down. The main event with Rock vs Stone Cold Steve Austin is a match that will go down in history. I recommend everyone to buy this tape because it signifies how Wrestlemania is the ""Grandaddy of 'em All!",986342400,,1329,4.469135802469136
1394505,4,B000055ZK9,"I was at Wrestlemania X-Seven and it was a pretty good event. McMahon said that it was the biggest Wrestlemania ever. I disagree with that, but it did have quite a few good matches. With the exception of the Benoit/Angle and Test/Guerrero matches, it was a good show. The Triple H/Undertaker, Kane/Raven/Big Show, Shane/Vince and TLC II matches were defintely the best of the night. The rest of the matches were also very entertaining. All in all, a good PPV. If you're a WWF fan, you'll probably enjoy this. It was however missing two things, Jerry Lawler and The Kat.",986256000,,569,4.7
1394506,5,B000055ZK9,"I love Wrestlemania. Wrestlemania is like the Super Bowl of wrestling. All the great fueds end here.
Although Wrestlemania 16 wasn't that great, WM 17 has a GREAT card this year headlined by a match that many have been waiting 2 years to see!
Stonecold Steve Austin vs. The Rock
Stonecold just returned from being out for a year in November. He had others on his mind like Kurt Angle, HHH, and Rikishi but has finally caught up to his biggest nemisis: The Rock!
And, SCSA's place in the fans hearts has somewhat been taking by The Rock, as he was the top face in the WWF for awhile. Will the Texas fans back Steve or go for there champ, The Rock?
It's gonna be a slobberknocker, much like there 1999 match was. Except now, the fans love BOTH these guys and The Rock espically has improved his game. Great match here.
We also get to see the great undercard, such as The Undertaker vs. HHH and Kane vs. The Big Show! A big Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match has been rumored to take place between the Table-loving Dudleyz, Edge/Christian and there head-chair-shots, and the highflying, ladder loving Hardyz!
As of right now, we may even see Shane McMahon vs. his father Vince McMahon himself!

1394528,5,B000055ZK9,"The Attitude Era was the greatest era in wrestling history.  This was the finale.

It features almost all the key players of the Attitude Era, featuring the two biggest stars ever in the main event: Rock vs. Austin.  Also on the card you get Kurt Angle, Benoit, Triple H, Undertaker, and the entire McMahon family.

The three-way TLC tag team championship match is one of the wildest bouts in wrestling history, packed with unbelievable stunts.

This was the culmination of wrestling's hot period that started with WCW and the nWo in 1996.  By the time of this event, WCW was sold to WWF and no longer existed.  The influential underground federation ECW has also folded.  Wrestlemania 17, the best pay-per-view of all time, was the last night of wrestling's biggest boom period.  Odds are, wrestling will never get as popular ever again.  WM 17 was a very memorable night.  Wrestling has never been the same since.",1367020800,,915,4.801282051282051

We saw an awesome grudge match between Taker and HHH. Raven, Big Show and Kane had a great three way dance for the hardcore title. The story here was the return of Stone Cold. This was an important match in his career. I think this was one of his best matches of all time only equaled with Bret Hart at Wrestlemania 13. This was the best match The Rock and Austin ever had. This dvd is rare and can be pricey but it's worth the price based on the quality of the card being the greatest Wrestlemania.

Intercontinental Championship match
Chris Jericho (champion) vs. William Regal
Good opener, these two have pretty decent chemistry and you always know Jericho is going to be great out there. Regal put up a really good fight working over Jericho's arm and Jericho returned with an equally great fight. In the end, Jericho successfully hits the lionsault to retain his gold against Regal.
Winner and still champion: Chris Jericho
rating: 7/10

Six man tag team match
APA & Tazz w/ Jacqueline vs. Right To Censor
Average, it was just a filler on the card really. Tazz hits some nice suplexes and APA gets their shots in too. It was a short match, but pretty action filled. The goodfather just couldn't take the Clothesline from Bradshaw.
winners: APA & Tazz w/Jacqueline
rating: 5/10

Triple threat Hardcore match for the Hardcore Championship
Raven (champion) vs. Kane vs. Big show
It was pretty hardcore. Not very many weapons used but a lot of use of the different objects around them. Both of the giants looked to get Raven alone because he was the smallest and easiest to pin. Raven takes all the abuse, he gets thrown through a window, his head smashed into a wall and thrown off the stage (along with big show). big show and kane both grabbed each others necks and threw each other through a wall, and then Raven took off in a golf cart with big show on the back with kane in another cart not far behind with the referee. eventually, Big Show lifed Raven up in the air and kane booted him in the face so they both fell off the stage. then kane jumped off of it and leg dropped big show for the win
Winner and new Hardcore Champion: Kane
rating: 8/10

European Championship match
Test (champion) vs. Eddie Guerrero w/Perry Saturn
Test towered over eddie on this match and mostly tossed eddie around. but then he misses the big boot and gets tangled in the ropes by his ankle. once he was freed, the match was all about eddie. Whenever Test got up, either eddie or an interfering Saturn wuld put him back down again. Eddie eventually picked up the win after Malenko distracted the ref and eddie hit Test with the title belt.
Winner and new European Champion: Eddie Guerrero
rating: 6/10

Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit
WOW, great great great wrestling match put on by these two. Kurt really wanted to win this one. It started out with a lot of great grappling and then angle decked Benoit turning it into a brawl. Then it turned into a regular wrestling match. each of these guys aiming to hit their finishing submissions. sometimes getting them locked in, sometimes not. Benoit at one point had the crossface on angle and he tapped but the ref was out. then benoit kicked out of the angle slam. then angle rolled up benoit by the tights picking up a cheated victory. This was later named the tenth best match in wrestlemania history.
Winner: Kurt Angle

Women's Championship match
Ivory (champion) vs. Chyna
Whenever Chyna walks into a women's match, its obvious she is going to win. Ivory gets a few good shots at the injured neck but Chyna just gets up and squashes her. Not really worth watching
Winner and new Women's Champion: Chyna
Rating: 3/10

Street fight match
Shane Mcmahon vs. Vince Mcmahon w/ Mick Foley as guest referee
i loved this match. probably the greatest storyline leading up to a match ever! at first, it was Mr Mcmahon all the way. but then shane got back in it and hit his father with some nice punch combos and his signature kendo stick. Shane went for an elbow drop through the announce table but Stephanie pulled her daddy off the table, sending shane crashing through it. Mick didn't really have any affect on the match until mr. mcmahon hit him with a steel chair right in the head. Mr. mcmahon put his sedated wife in a chair in the corner of the ring after trish stratus had turned on vince and chased Stephanie out of the arena. Vince started hitting shane in the head with trash cans and Linda Mcmahon rose from her chair (causing probably the loudest ovasion of the entire night) and kicked her ex husband right in the family jewels. then mick regained consciousness and beat the hell outta vince. then shane put a trash can in vince's face and hit the coast to coast dropkick to win.
Winner: Shane Mcmahon

TLC II match for the WWF tag team championships
Dudley boyz (champions) vs. Hardy boyz vs. Edge and Christian
These three teams went out and absolutly demolished each other!!! TLC II has more broken tables, dented chairs and and usage of ladders than TLC I did. Here are just some of the awesome highlights. Edge spearing Jeff Hardy from midair, Edge jumping off a chair and clotheslineing Matt Hardy off the ladder, Bubba Ray powerbombing Jeff Hardy on top of Edge through a table, Rhyno spearing Matt hardy through a table, Spike Dudley bulldogging Christian through a table, lita cracking Spike Dudleys head with a chair only to turn around to a 3D from the other two dudleys, Jeff Hardy hitting the swanton off the ladder putting Spike dudley and Rhyno through two tables, Jeff Hardy jumping off matts back and dropkicking Edge off the ladder and probably the awesomest part, bubba ray and matt hardy falling off a ladder through a stack of 4 tables on the outside. In the end, D-von was on top oof the ladder and edge grabbed his ankle and held him there while Rhyno lifted Christian up the ladder on his shoulders so he could grab the belts.

Slaughter vs. Gobbledy Gooker vs. One Man Gang vs. Doink the Clown vs. Kimchee vs. Repo Man vs. The goon vs. Hillbilly Jim vs. Duke Droese vs. Iron Sheik
i saw no point in this besides trying to let the old legends prove they still got it. it wasn't the that long and the iron sheik eliminated SGT. slaughter in the end to win. but slaughter got back in the ring and locked him in the cobra clutch to celebrate afterwards.
Winner: the iron sheik
rating: 4/10

Triple H vs. The Undertaker
Really good match, lots of great action. But when the ref gets his lights out, it turned into a brawl outside the ring in the audience. My personal favorite part was when Undertaker chokslamed Triple H off a camera tower onto the floor far below. they finally got back in the ring and taker lifted triple h in the air for the last ride but triple h picked up the sledgehammer on the way up and smacked taker hard in the skull with it, busting him open. taker got back up and hit the last ride though, keeping his wrestlemania record alive.
winner: Undertaker

WWF championship match
The Rock (champion) vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin
The greatest match out of all three of their wrestlemania matches. Austin lead the entire match with Rock barely doing anything the entire time. it looked like stone cold was in winning position and then vince mcmahon came out, Handed austin a chair and austin cracked rock over the head with it. Rock kicked out though. causing austin to hit the stunner, which rock kicked out of, then another chair shot, rock kicked out and reversed and started beating and vince, then austin hit another stunner, rock kicked out, and then he started just wailing on him with chair while he was on the ground, hitting about 10 times and then getting the full pin to become champ, some people booed, most people didn't care that austin was working with vince because it was still the same stone cold. so a lot of people still cheered.
Winner and new WWF champion: Stone Cold Steve Austin
rating: 9/10 (would have been a 10/10 but the working with vince ruined it)

Highlights:

Jericho vs. William Regal- 3.5/5

APA & Tazz vs. Right to Censor- It was just a match to fill time, but still entertaining, with the annoying RTC losing at the end..3/5

Eddie Guerrero(RIP) vs. Test- To be a time slot filler, they had a match that got better as time went on. But with Eddie G., he'll always put on a decent match.....3.5/5

Kane vs. Big Show vs. raven- A better match than most might have thought it would be. Like how they fought all over the arena. 3.5/5

T.L.C.II- Terrific match with some hard falls and awesome aerials. Damn, The Hardy Boyz deserved to win, but alas, Edge & Christian win again...5/5

Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit- Started out REALLY slow. But, if you like pure wrestling, this is a classic for you. Back & forth, until Angle wins at the end. The best ""real"" wrestling match on the card...5/5

The Gimmick battle royal had some good spots. Good entertainment value 3.5/5

Shane vs. Vince- Really liked this match except for the WCW allegiances. They should've kept that out the picture. The action was non-stop, and they really went at it. Trish turning on Vince was funny, and Linda ""rising up"" was epic in live version....Plus Shane's trash can finisher is a testament to his real athletic ability, seeing how he was already around 30...5/5

Chyna vs. Ivory- was a down spot. Terrible. All they had to do was lengthen the match.. 1.5/5

HHH vs. Taker- This was a match that was before it's time, seeing as how they could've had this same caliber match years later, but had this classic in 2001...A straight out brawl, all over the Astrodome. there were points where you really believed HHH would beat Taker..Blood, chairs, sledgehammers, oh my!!lol..5/5

Rock vs. Austin- The buildup, in my opinion, is the greatest WWE ever had. You can buy this dvd just to see this match. This was Probably the greatest WM main event you'll ever see. The 2 biggest stars in the company on Austin's turf, where he really couldn't beat Rocky..then a heel turn at the end, where he joins with arch-rival Vinnie Mac..CLASSIC.....5/5",1296691200,,2284,4.751898734177215

1394548,4,B000055ZK9,"This is about the time when the WWE began to really take off with their success and hype for the Wrestlemania events.  Maybe the 17th version of the spectacle was not the absolute best of the series, but it is indeed one of the better ones.  I always enjoy revisiting this event to watch a few of the matches.  Overall, the card is pretty strong:

Intercontinental Title:
Chris Jericho vs. William Regal
This was a great choice for an opener.  I have always liked Regal and his brawler/technical style that he brings to his matches.  Jericho is always capable of putting on an all-star match.  In addition to this, the IC belt is always a good way to start off any PPV event.

RTC vs. Taz & The APA:
Here, we have something that is just plain average.  Yes, there is some ""build-up"" when Bradshaw attempts to raise hype before the match begins, but it eventually does not matter.  Not that I was disappointed with the match by any means, but I don't think I am being unfair when I say that a Wrestlemania should not have ""filler"" matches.

Hardcore Title:
Raven vs. Kane vs. Big Show
This is another testament to the overall strong event that WM17 was.  I loved every minute of this intense battle between the two.  I liked WWE's decision to go with two big men against Raven for the title.  The match goes all throughout the arena, has broken glass, collapsing walls, free-falls, weapons, and even a golf cart!  The ending of the match is also very satisfying.  Because I highly recommend this event, I will not give away spoilers, but this match is definitely worth a look!

European Title:
Eddie Guerrero w/ Perry Saturn vs. Test
This match for the now shelved European Title was actually kind of a bore.  Both men are capable of a great contest, but for some reason, just managed to put together a sub-par, average, forgettable match for the belt (what a time to chose to do that).  Perhaps if the Euro Title generated a little more excitement with its match and their competitors, it would have been a large success than it was.  You'll be glad to know that these two actually do go on to compete in better matches against one another.

Chris Beniot vs. Kurt Angle:
Other than their match at the Royal Rumble, this is the best time to watch these two together.  The pace of the match is not as incredible as you really want it to be, but it is good enough.  This turns out to be, probably the best match on the card.  Which is actually saying a lot, because the event does begin to turn up the volume and produce a lot of classics that will not soon be forgotten.  Maybe the reason that it does not stand out as much as their other encounters do is because it is not the only good match on the card.  But anyway, a technical masterpiece!

Women's Title:
Ivory vs. Chyna
Yes, we all know that Chyna is a amazon of a woman who can dominate a match with her eyes closed, but this excuse for a match tries to get us to believe that a successful and talented competitor such as Ivory cannot even compete with her.  Personally, I do not understand why this match was even on the card for WM17, especially when they are using the largest stage of the year to try to promote the divas division.  The match is a total 3 minute squash.  Disappointment here.

Special Guest Referee Street Fight:
Shane McMahon vs. Vince McMahon; Mick Foley as special guest official
I really did enjoy the whole dispute that they were promoting with the WCW vs. WWE.  Usually when Mr. McMahon cuts a promo around the time of Wrestlemania to give us a ""blockbuster"" main event, it turns out to be a total DUD.  Shane McMahon is an exciting performer in his own right, and a street fight against the chairmen with Foley as the guest referee is a formula for a very entertaining match.  The drama did not stop there, as Stephanie McMahon and Trish Stratus both add to the mix of the formula.  The conflict between the two women really had me sold about this time.  As for the match.. it is a brutal and aggressive display of a hardcore match.  Maybe it will not live up to the standards of ECW hardcore junkies, but it nonetheless has unlimited use of weapons, highflying risks, and all of the drama and suspense that you could ask for.  To top it off, Foley does an impeccable job of selling the storyline to us.  The match is well worth the lengthy time it lasts!

World Tag Title TLC Match:
Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian
Rivaling the match that the three teams had during the 2000 installment of Summerslam, this incredible display of showmanship is a gem for the company.  I can't decide which contest I prefer between the first and second TLC match, but nonetheless this is an outstanding match.  From the time after the match, there have been a number of exciting ladder matches of this sort, but in my opinion, this match set the groundwork for what we have today.  They each did a respectable job, all willing to put their bodies on the line in order to entertain a huge audience.  There are also a number of interferences that add to the carnage.  The incredible displays of the athleticism never seems to end, and the match is a nail-biter from bell to bell.  A classic!

There is a battle royal in here somewhere with each of the participants being gimmicked in some way, but this is not really worthy of the time that it took up.  If you're looking for some ""comedic"" relief from the intense match from before then go ahead and take a look,  if you're not, just skip this.

Triple H vs. Undertaker:
The match here is also strong.  The match has two big names, and it is nice to watch the two stars of the company go at it during the biggest event of the year.  There are a couple of points in the match where Hunter takes some hard hits, and the suspense and onslaught of close calls is not missing.  The match even takes place in the crowd for a lot of the bout, involving the audience yet again during Wrestlemania.  Overall, we all know who wins the match, but it is a great way to continue a great show.

WWE Title No DQ match:
Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. The Rock
What a way to end this event!  Yet again, we get a match that features the huge stars of the company!  Fans all over the world have loved to see these two main event large broadcasts, and they might be getting their most exciting dose of it at WM17.  The match has a lot of charisma and buildup.  The ending of the match is even more exciting when the chairmen makes another appearance to shock the crowd when he aids Austin for the win.  The DQ stipulation of the match adds a lot to it as well, but we could have all predicted the outcome when we saw McMahon coming down the ramp.  All in all, an outstanding way to end the show!

I highly recommend this Wrestlemania.  The DVD has a lot of extras and backstage segments to add to the show.",1271808000,,6815,4.363780778395552
1394549,4,B000055ZK9,"It is December 23, 2009 when I am typing this review.  I am stuck behind a hotel desk with nothing to do.  I am bored beyond belief.  I am so bored that I've chosen to type a review of arguably the most beloved ""WrestleMania"" of all time.  It's not my personal favorite (more on that later), but it's still very good.

*********************************************

1) Intercontinental Championship
Chris Jericho (champion) v. William Regal (WWF Commissioner)
---What better way to kick off a show than two gifted wrestlers who've refined their craft all over the world?  Regal was capable of some great technical contests, and Jericho has always been one of the best in the world.  These two mix it up quite well.  I would've preferred if these guys got to have a longer match, but I suppose that's a compliment to how well these guys worked together.
""7.0 / 10""
______________________________________

2) Right To Censor v. Tazz & The APA
---After a corny backstage segment where Texas' own Bradshaw gets all worked up, we get a pointless but watchable filler match.  If you're expecting these 6 guys to tear the house down, you've come to the wrong place.  If you're okay with a trio of good guys win one over a band of hated villains, then you won't mind watching Bradshaw win one in his home state.
""4.0 / 10""
______________________________________

3) Hardcore Championship
Raven (champion) v. Kane v. Big Show
---This one is just nuts!  The WWF often treated the Hardcore belt with crazy antics that usually involved brawling all over the arena.  But what makes this one better (in my opinion) is that it's goofy AND still violent.  There are a couple of genuine ouch moments in this fight.  Raven takes the worst of the beatings in this one, almost being severely injured at one point by a golf cart.  Big Show and Kane also get to shine, even if I had a hard time believing that guys this large would have any problem winning a match like this.  I'm not giving this Triple Threat a very high score, but I still had a good time watching it.
""6.5 / 10""
______________________________________

4) European Championship
Eddie Guerrero (w/ Perry Saturn) v. Test (champion)
---This title bout is really the only one that disappoints me, because in 2001, I loved watching either of these guys wrestle.  I was hoping for a good showdown between the globally-respected Guerrero and the criminally-underrated Test.  Sadly, something was just off here.  Basically, I loved watching Test slam and toss Eddie around, but whenever Eddie was in control of the contest, these two just didn't click.  Plus, Saturn's ringside involvement was kinda dull (though his pink pimp had is something to behold).  Not a terrible match, but a huge letdown considering how much I loved watching these guys.
""5.5 / 10""
______________________________________

5) Kurt Angle v. Chris Benoit
---I want to put things in perspective here, because by now, 99.9% of wrestling fans agree that any Angle/Benoit contest is worth a PPV purchase.  But by ""WM 17"", these guys hadn't mixed it up a whole lot.  I think most of us were expecting a fast-paced back-and-forth blockbuster.  Instead, Angle & Benoit gave us a most delightful surprise: very old-school, amateur-style mat wrestling.  The first five minutes are such a shock, as Angle & Benoit use takedowns & holds that might 'LOOK' boring to the typical WWF fan.  But then those of us who were initially bored realized that we were watching the most intelligent and sensible form of in-ring competition.  It made us question why superstars ever run off the ropes, when waistlock takedowns are much more effective.  Don't worry, the pace gradually quickens, and the contest grows into one of the PPV's best.  I believe that Angle & Benoit outdid themselves in later matches, but this encounter sure made one hell of an impression.
""8.0 / 10""
______________________________________

6) Women's Championship
Ivory (champion) v. Chyna
---On Amazon, you'll often read wrestling reviews that use the term ""Push The Storyline"".  Here's your textbook example.  The point isn't whether Chyna will fail to get her revenge or reclaim her gold.  The point is whether the story comes to a satisfying conclusion.  While I would've preferred a longer competition for the title (I had great admiration for both women), the outcome was inevitable.  These storyline-pushers are hard to score.  No matter what number I put, the bottom line is that I wanted a much longer match, but was satisfied overall with this glorified squash.
""4.0 / 10"" (""8"" for story conclusion & execution, ""2"" for short contest)
______________________________________

7) Street Fight - Guest Referee: Mick Foley
Shane McMahon (WCW Owner) v. Vince McMahon (WWF Chairman)
---History has shown us how this angle played out, but the WCW angle wasn't really the primary focus yet.  At the time, the McMahon mania was almost as maddening as the year before.  Vince was an unfaithful husband in an affair with Trish Stratus, while wife Linda was comatose, daughter Stephanie remained ""Daddy's Little Girl"", while Shane was the only moral and sensible one on the family.  Oh, and Mick Foley somehow became the referee.  You with me so far?...Oh well, the video package will explain everything.  Frankly, I loved the craziness of this fight.  Vince and Shane aren't afraid to pummel each other with slaps, garbage cans, and kendo sticks.  Throw in an announcer table crash, a ringside catfight, a miraculous coma-recovery, Mr. Socko, and the debut of Shane's Coast-To-Coast..... man this is one wacky scenario!  Bottom line - even if you hate the McMahon Family storylines, I think this one will entertain most.
""7.0 / 10""
______________________________________

8) TLC II - Tag Team Championships
The Hardy Boyz v. Edge & Christian v. The Dudley Boyz (champions)
---Perhaps the most popular Ladder Match of all time, this one is sure to please fans of hardcore or weapons action.  These three teams gave the tag division a huge jolt for over a year, and this was kind of their swan song, even though there was a TLC 3 a couple months later.  It was time to put this saga to rest, and all six men did a great job of doing so.  Actually, each team gets an accomplice to join the fun (Rhyno for E&C, Spike for the Dudleyz, Lita for the Hardyz).  Everyone is game for the bumps, bruises, and battered bodies.  However, for a long time, I've felt TLC II was overrated; I think I've finally nailed my nitpick.  There's simply too much.  I have great respect for these men (and woman) putting their bodies through so much carnage.  But TLC II is one of those Ladder Matches where it delivers 50 high spots when 20 would've been fine.  TLC II isn't satisfied with only having a handful of great moments, which makes a believable hard-hitting Ladder Match become an over-the-top spotfest.  I love TLC II; it's an excellent display from all involved.  But it's not the masterpiece that most have claimed it to be.
""8.5 / 10""
______________________________________
9) Gimmick Battle Royal
---While this was neat in theory, WWF really dropped the ball with this one.  About 20 or so wrestlers participate in a traditional over-the-top battle royal, with all wrestlers being known for some sort of crazy character.  For every respectable guy like Earthquake or Iron Sheik, there's a Repo Man or Gobbly Gooker to keep things from getting too serious.  Frankly, this is the fastest Battle Royal I've ever seen, as these guys just fall over the ropes in lazy fashion.  Only a few eliminations have any creativity in them.  I don't mind fun throwaways, but this one came off as lazy.
""4.0 / 10""
______________________________________

10) Triple H v. The Undertaker
---Oddly enough, the Undertaker's 9th match at ""WrestleMania"" wasn't tagged with the ""Undefeated Streak"" that hovers over his appearances today.  It was still such a bizarre coincidence that nobody ever beat Taker at this event.  Anybody who was paying attention the Streak, however, surely paid attention to HHH.  After all, his career skyrocketed in 2000, and 2001 was off to a very promising start.  This one features very little in the way of technical competition, and quickly becomes a slugfest that goes into the crowd for most of the match.  Everything was going fine until a weakass spot occurred: HHH is chokeslammed from a high platform onto a foamy crashpad, and you don't even get a hard ""oomph!"" to let you know it was supposed to hurt.  Thankfully, when the two return to the ring, the match ends with a series of counters and kickouts that are well worth the wait.  This is a good match, but when you think back on the foamy crashpad and the referee being down for over 10 minutes, it's a tad silly.
""7.0 / 10""
______________________________________

11) WWF Championship - No Disqualifications
`Stone Cold' Steve Austin v. The Rock (champion)
---I have to be fair and admit that Austin/Rock matches aren't my favorites.  They're good matches, but aren't the glorious classics that most fans believe they are.  Frankly, my favorite Austin/Rock match took place in England, and was released in the United States on DVD.  But as overrated as I think this main event is, it is a very solid way to end a ""WrestleMania"" PPV.  The charisma and hard work from these guys can't be overstated.  The match is pretty long (in a good way), and these guys pulled off the impossible: They delivered a ""WrestleMania"" rematch that didn't feel like a complete retread.  But I have some big problems with this one.  First off, Debra McMichael's role as Rock's manager was completely forgotten.  Secondly, the No-DQ stipulation was a pleasant but illogical surprise.  Howard Finkel basically announced it on the microphone, and we were as confused as we were excited.  Also, I'm not a fan of stolen finishers (Rock doing the Stunner, or Austin doing the Rock Bottom).  Finally, as everyone knows, ""WM 17"" ends with a huge twist as Vince McMahon helps his sworn enemy Steve Austin to win the gold.  But the twist is cheapened when Rock kicks out of the assault, only to get bludgeoned with a few more chair shots.  We didn't need that false hope of The Rock surviving, because it was pretty obvious he wouldn't.  I know I've trashed this match more than I've praised it.  I guess when everyone gives it endless praise, I feel compelled to bring it off its untouchable pedestal.  The Rock/Austin rematch at ""WM 17"" is quite good, but I don't think it's a masterpiece.  Then again, ""WrestleMania X-Seven"" isn't my favorite of the series.  How fitting.
""7.0 / 10""
______________________________________

""WrestleMania X-Seven"", without question, is the most popular edition of the annual extravaganza.  I really like it, but have a handful of others that I enjoyed more.  I liked a few different ""WM"" PPVs more for a variety of reasons.  I loved the one-trick pony that was ""WM 12"" (1996).  I loved the All-State Arena crowd from ""WM 22"" (2006).  I loved most of ""WM 13"" or ""WM 21 (1997, 2005), even though they bombed in their final stretches.  I loved the constant supply of solid matches in the underrated ""WM 7"" (1991).  Most of all, I love ""WM 19"" (2003) from start to finish.

But as another reviewer explained to me (Jose, by the way - look up his reviews), ""WM 17"" has something for everybody.  You have a couple technical wrestling matches.  You get a few silly exhibitions.  You get a handful of weapons & hardcore action matches.  You get a squash.  Some storylines begin; others are brought to a close.

I know I basically typed a review explaining why ""WrestleMania X-Seven"" isn't my favorite.  Forgive the rambles.  An hour or two later after typing my review, sitting behind my hotel desk, I'm still bored on a slow day with nothing to do.",1261526400,,11771,4.862745098039215
1394550,5,B000055ZK9,"My copy of this just arrived in the mail along with mania 19. this is probably my favourite ppv of all time, what the hell, my favourite anything of all time. After all the wrestlemanioas weve had recently id kind of accepted that this might just not be that good despite all the great reviews, i have never ever been more wrong. even the average matches were entertaining, they all just had that wrestlemania feel, you never forgot what ppv you were watching which tends to happen rather alot at times like wm25. the crowd in this one (67,925) made the ppv 100% better, they were so into every match on the card that they even managed to make regal seem mildly intense. there were three matches or so that really made me go 'shamwow'

TLCII match

so many high spots i cant even mention half of them. even the interferance was great, just adding to the match. so many crazy jumps and even one fall off a ladder which was insane. even if every other match on the card failed i would buy this dvd (exactly what i would recomend for wm16, just for the tlc match).

Taker vs H

not alot of people remember this match but its really stuck for me. it was a complete brawl and it fit the competitors perfectly. Undertakers entrance was mega intense, the crowd went nuts. thers one huge chokeslam, obviously theres SOMETHING not quite right about it its still cool ;)

Rock v Austin

words cannot describe or do justice to this match. there were so many near falls, huge story twist, everything about it was mint. i cant even describe it, you know what, just buy this dvd, buy it now and prepare to see value for your money like youve never known. i would gladly pay $100 for thsi baby.

1394551,5,B000055ZK9,"Wrestlemania is the super bowl in sports entertainment. I bought this when I was 11 right as it came out on VHS baby lol. It took place in the Astrodome in Houston Texas, and had over 65,000 fans there.

1. Chris Jericho versus William Regal, this was a good opening match for the Intercontinental title, I remember as the lights turn off for Jericho's entrance, you could still see everything from the light outside or something, it was not dark at all. It had a good promo as well for the match, two very good technical wrestlers. Jericho was battling a shoulder injury but still had  a good match. 6.5/10

2. The APA and Tazz versus The Right To Censor, this was a good match to have just as a filler, Bradshaw and Jacqueline had a good promo, talking about Texas and the Astrodome and such than they came out and pretty much destroyed, Bradshaw had a awesome clothes line from Hell on the Goodfather. 7/10

3. Raven versus Kane versus The Big Show, for the Hardcore Title, This was a one of the best hardcore title matches I have seen. Sadly though I think Kane got screwed by putting him in this match, he lasted over a hour in the Rumble, and got put in this match...oh well...they fought through the crowd and into the backstage, through a window, a wall, a door, Kane drives a golf cart, all ends up on the stage and Kane does a legdrop of the stage, its a must see. 9/10

4. Test versus Eddie Guerrero for the European Title, I really did not think this was a filler match, but Eddie used his high flying ability and Test used his power, really turned out to be an alright match. 7/10 R.I.P to both men.

5. Chris Benoit versus Kurt Angle, to a traditional wrestling fan this match is awesome, so in my eyes it was great. I really loved watching Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit in the ring, and when they are put against each other, there is nothing better. Alot of wreslting holds and greco-roman suplexes. Kurt Angle was a coward at the time, but I could watch his matches all day. 9/10

6. Chyna versus Ivory for the womens title, This match took about 3 minutes, it was totally obvious that Chyna would wipe the floor with Ivory, and she did. Ivory was a bad in ring wrestler and talent in my eyes. 4/10.

7. Shane Mcmahon versus Vince Mcmahon in a street fight, Very good match with one of the best story lines ever behind it, when Shane bought WCW from under Vince. A very good match, considering these guys wrestling maybe 5 times a year. Shane pulled off some amazing moves in this one, also the whole Mcamahon family was at ringside as well. Mick Foley was the special guest referee as well. Ended in dramatic fashion as well. Shane comes out victorious. 9/10

8. Edge and Christian versus the Hardy Boyz versus The Dudley Boyz in TLC II, this was in my opinion the best TLC match, I really enjoyed this match, it is very hard to describe in words, you just have to see it.

9. Gimmick Battle Royal, It was cool to see the oldies come back for a bit, Doink the Clown, The Iron Shiek, Hillybilly Jim, and others, it was really short, but a fun match. 7/10

10. Triple H versus The Undertaker, this was not your typical wrestling match, it was a full blown brawl, they were in the ring for about 10 minutes, Taker punches the ref out, and they brawl throughout the stadium, and it is a overall great match. I am pretty sure you guys know who wins this one.

11. Stone Cold Steve Austin versus The Rock for the WWF title, A very very good promo, Austin is obsessed with being the champ, and this is a very good match, better than their match at Wrestlemania 15, I really enjoyed this match, and I watch the last 5 minutes all the time, even though it was the turning point, I loved when Austin was a heel. It was awesome

WWF Intercontinental Championship
Chris Jericho (C) vs William Regal
The way this match was set, it was BORING.  But the phenomenal performers Jericho and Regal are, they did their best to make it as exciting as possible, and while it may have been boring, they did their best not to make it so, and the crowd loved it.  (6/10)

Tazz and The Acolytes (APA) vs Right To Censor
I expected nothing from this match, but it gave me something.  It was exactly as long as it needed to be, with no slow spots, and with everyone contributing something amazing to it, be it double team moves, to some suplexes, to generic brawling or power moves.  It was exactly as long as it needed to be, and had a great short run to it.  (9/10)

WWF Hardcore Championship
Raven (C) vs Kane vs The Big Show
If this sort of match were done today, it would be a complete bomb.  Here, though, it was just what you expect from a hardcore match and then some.  They brawled in the arena, and went backstage, with amazing spots such as Big Show tossing Raven into a wall and denting it, a botched go-kart chase which nearly results in Raven being run down by Kane, Raven being tossed through a glass window, Big Show and Kane brawling in a bathroom, and Big Show tearing down a wall, all culminating in two big spots on top of the ramp which see Kane win the championship.  Pure WWF Hardcore goodness.  (10/10)

WWF European Championship
Test (C) vs Eddie Guerrero
Far from a perfect match, this one was nevertheless a decent wrestling display of the athletic Guerrero vs a still-capable of putting on a decent match Test.  It wasn't too long, so it wasn't too boring, but a decent match nonetheless.  (7/10)

Kurt Angle vs GUY WHO NEVER EXISTED
Their match at Royal Rumble 2003 was utter crap.  THIS match bore traces of ECW, which unfortunately much of the audience was unable to appreciate, but they did enjoy it nonetheless.  PERSON WHO DID NOT EXIST and Angle had amazing back-and-forth chain wrestling for the first third of the match, culminating in WWF-style brawling, and back to more hard-style wrestling.  While not exactly a technical wrestling fan's dream match, it came as close as a WWF match was likely to come.  (10/10)

WWF Women's Championship
Ivory (C) vs Chyna
Yes, this wasn't much of a match, and more of an excuse to have Chyna squash Ivory as revenge for kayfabe breaking her neck.  (2/10)

Shane McMahon vs Vince McMahon
The predecessor to the Invasion storyline, this one was certainly worlds' better than the No Mercy 2003 street fight between Vince and Stephanie.  With the sheer amount of battles the McMahons have with one another, it's hard to tell them apart at times.  This is one of the few that is easily distinguishable.  The storyline involved Vince keeping Linda sedated, and here she rose up out of her chair to help Shane win.  Sort of a classic, but not a great match.  Shane is a phenomenal athlete.  (8/10)

WWF Tag Team Championship
Tables, Ladders, and Chairs
The Dudley Boys (C) vs The Hardy Boyz vs Edge and Christian
With what they've shown in the Ladder match at Royal Rumble 2000, the Ladder match at Wrestlemania 2000, and the first Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, you can't ever expect failure from these six.  They put on another phenomenal outing full of the best spots and action you expect, and in front of 67,000+ people, it was an amazing auditory experience as well as visual.  (10/10)

Gimmick Battle Royal
So much hype for all these old legends (and Gobbledygooker) and the guest commentators Bobby Heenan and Gene Oakerlund, the match lasted only about 3 minutes.  Not nearly enough, though Heenan managed to show why he's one of the best color commentators of all time in that short time.  (5/10)

The Undertaker vs Triple H
Aside from Motorhead's sloppy performance of ""The Game"", this one was beyond my expectations, as Triple H succeeded in helping carry this to be one hell of a Wrestlemania match between two elite veterans hardened with experience and slowed by age, but not stopped.  (8/10)

WWF Championship
The Rock (C) vs Stone Cold Steve Austin
I can't really say more than that it was a classic.  Similar to Austin vs Dude Love, or Cactus Jack vs Triple H in 2000, this was a classic.  For 28 minutes, these two superstars brutalized each other with classic WWF-style wrestling, emphasizing power and athleticism and some extreme wrestling talent, genuinely brutal-looking submission holds, and overall great performing by both men involved.  It was the first time since becoming ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin that Austin turned heel, and it was a hell of a way to turn.  (10/10)

With arguments could be made for both of those statements, this event is undoubtfully a must see event.

WrestleMania 17 was a significant event in World Wrestling Entertainment's history at the time. With WrestleMania 2000 previously failing on so many levels such as too many tag team matches, triple threats, & unproven wrestlers that didn't belong on the card whatsoever, WWE needed WrestleMania X-Seven to succeed & it did.

This WrestleMania card had something for everyone to appreciate that WrestleMania 2000 didn't have. True technical wrestling for the true wrestling fans in the Benoit/Angle confrontation, hardcore wrestling for the die-hard ECW fans in the Hardcore Title Match & in the TLC 2 Match, over-the-top storylines including the Father vs. Son McMahon Family Street Fight involving all four members of the McMahon Family, having the Gimmick Battle Royal for entertainment, & having 4 of the greatest superstars (at the time) squaring off against one another in HHH vs. Undertaker & in the main event as The Rock battled Stone Cold Steve Austin with the aftermath surprising everyone in the building & watching on TV.

Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho Vs. William Regal - A very good choice for an opener. Nothing really memorable or exciting in the match but solid wrestling. Jericho was selling his injured shoulder leaving Regal targeting it throughout the match. Not a technical masterpiece but its a match that did its job. 3.5/5

A.P.A. & Tazz Vs. Right To Censor - This was an average filler at best but it served its purpose. Bradshaw cut an appropriate promo before the match & it was a good idea to have Bradshaw wrestle in his home state. Both teams put in a good effort for the 5 minutes they were out there & it was a good choice to allow this match to be on the card. 2.25/5

WWE Hardcore Champion Raven Vs. Kane Vs. The Big Show - This is the part of the night where the event truly begins to shine & pick up. Raven was put at a disadvantage from that start as he was in there with Kane & The Big Show. Kane & TBS worked really well in this type of environment & Raven did his best to go back to his ECW ways to put on a good Hardcore Match. This match was entertaining from start to finish & it delivered. 3.5/5

European Champion Test Vs. Eddie Guerrero - This was another filler match but it played out well. Test's best run in his career was in 2001 & Eddie has the ability to have a good match with just about anyone so this match was good. Some slight interferences from Radicalz member Saturn with a little ""lyin', cheatin', & stealin'"" from Eddie that made for a good match. A good performance from both men & this was a good match for the now shelved European Title. 4/5

Kurt Angle Vs. Chris Benoit - The Olympic Gold Medalist & The Rabid Wolverine put on one great wrestling match. This is also the first true technical match at a WrestleMania since Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels from WM 12. Everything a wrestling match should have, Benoit & Angle gave it. Lots of great suplexes, reversals, finsher escapes, near falls, high risk, & everything in between. This is a great one-on-one match & one of the bests in WrestleMania history. 5/5

WWE Women's Champion Ivory Vs. Chyna - This is a total squash match. WWE did the rigth thing to give Chyna the belt but Chyna deserved more credibility then this. This match is borderlining as the WORST Women's Title Match ever. This is the only low note of the night. 1.5/5

Shane McMahon Vs. Vince McMahon w/Mick Foley as the Special Referee (Street Fight) - This is a lot better of a match then what many thought it was going to be. The Street Fight rules was a good stipulation to the match & it really added more flavor to the match as well. The story told in the match was very good & it felt real at the same time. You could really feel the intensity in this match. A couple of good spots with Shane doing his usual table spot & also using the Van-Terminator for the first time in his offense with the shocking face-turn in Trish. A very good match that everyone will enjoy. 4/5

WWE Tag Team Champions The Dudley Boyz Vs. Edge & Christian Vs. The Hardy Boyz (Tables, Ladders, & Chairs Match) - These 3 teams took what they did at SummerSlam last year to a whole other level. TLC II has much more crash & burn spots, more death defying antics, more table crashes, more chair shots, & more breath taking moments then what TLC I had with special cameos from Rhyno, Lita, & Spike Dudley. This is one exciting match that did its due where it was amazing for every second all 3 of these teams were out there. 5/5

Gimmick Battle Royal - This is just an over-the-top battle royal featuring some of the WWE's most interesting & unique superstars from the past that includes Sgt. Slaughter, The Iron Sheik, Doink The Clown, Repo Man, Tug Boat, Earthquake, The Goon, Kamala, The Bushwackers, Nikolai Volkoff, Hillbilly Jim, Michael Hayes, & others with special commentating done by ""Mean"" Gene Okerlund & Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan. Its entertaining but nothing special. 2/5

Undertaker Vs. Triple H - This wasn't a wrestling match by any means, it was war from start to finish. Undertaker & HHH started the match very wildly & crazy and when the referee got taken out, this match turned into an out of control slugfest where the majority of the match is fought in the crowd. The last 10 minutes of the match is the most exciting where HHH & Undertaker has a great offensive exchange until HHH suffers to The Last Ride. Do not expect a 5 star classic wrestling match here as this match is the complete opposite. 4.25/5

WWE Champion The Rock Vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin (No Disqualification Match) - Props has to be given to WWE for making this match No DQ & allowing Stone Cold & The Rock to hold nothing back in this match. This main event has everything from technical wrestling, brawling, weapon use, blood, intensity, finisher escapes & stealing of the finshers, & eveything in between. Stone Cold & The Rock always have great chemistry together & this match is no exception as it is argubably their best match together. The Rock & Austin kept the match exciting with having no dull or boring moments in the match at all. This match will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through. The last 5 minutes will blow your breath away with the surprising heel turn of Steve Austin. A fantastic main event & an awesome way to end ""The Grand Daddy Of Them All"". 5/5

TLC II is brilliant. Its fast, hardcore and risk taking. The undertaker Vs HHH match isn't a hardcore match at start but ends up as one. Watch out for HHH getting chokeslammed off platform onto the ground.

Good opener, crowd was really behind Jericho. Worth a look, not a bad match. 6/10

Not a bad tag match. A little bit on the short side, but its decent. Worth watching once. 6/10

3. Triple Threat Match for the Hardcore Title: Raven (c) vs. Kane vs. Big Show

Very entertaining match. Mostly takes place backstage, with a couple nice spots. Raven takes quite the beating in this one, and the ending is pretty cool. Definitely worth watching, for sheer entertainment value alone. 7/10

4. European Title Match: Test (c) vs. Eddie Guerrero

Decent match I suppose, somewhat entertaining. Don't particularly like either man, but they put on decent performances. 6/10

5. Chris Beniot vs. Kurt Angle

Not as much of a classic as people make this out to be. Good match, don't get me wrong, but definitely overrated. Not one of the greatest Wrestlemania matches of all time, but still very good. These two mix very well together, and put on great performances. 8/10

Boy, the McMahons are quite the dysfunctional family aren't they? Well, we benefit from their antics, thats for sure. This is a very entertaining match with a couple great spots, and much chaos in and around the ring. Definitely worth watching, don't pass this up. 7.5/10

Not really a match, but nice to see some of the old legends come back to the ring, and nice to hear Mean Gene and Bobby ""the Brain"" commentating too. 6/10

10. Triple H vs. The Undertaker

A brawl through and through. These men mixed very well together, and venture through the crowd when the ref gets knocked out. Couple nice spots throughout, and just a great match overall. Probably 'Taker's best Wrestlemania match. 8.5/10

11. No Disqualification Match for the WWF Title: The Rock (c) vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin

Though the build-up for this match wasn't as good as for their match at Wrestlemania XV, the match itself was much better in my opinion. This was an all out war between these two. The match is very back and forth, and they don't hold back at all. These two put on exceptional performances. The winner is somewhat predictable, but the ending is one of the most shocking moments in wrestling history. Rather lame, but very suprising. Great match overall though, probably the best match between these two men. Don't miss this. 9/10

Many credit this as the greatest Wrestlemania in history, and I won't argue. The card has something for everyone: an excellent hardcore battle, a great technical wrestling match, a very entertaining street fight, amazing tag team action and high flying spots, a great brawl, and one of the best main events in Wrestlemania history. Only one bad match on the whole card, everything else is at least good. Definitely the best Wrestlemania of all time, and perhaps the greatest PPV the WWF/E has ever given us.

Match of the Night: The Rock vs. Stone Cold. Finally, how a Wrestlemania should be: saving the best for last. Even the screwjob finish couldn't hurt this one. A great match that had the crowd on their feet. Austin and Rock stole the show yet again.",1146182400,4,3766,4.751152073732719

BEST WRSTLEMANIA",1139356800,,1614,4.508771929824562
1394574,5,B000055ZK9,"WrestleMania X-7 was a special and historic night as this was perhaps the most unique event of its time. This was the first PPV event in which the WWF was the sole company left in town as WCW & ECW had gone out of business prior to the event, this was the first WrestleMania since IX that didn't have Jerry Lawler doing commentary as he had quit the company weeks prior while this marked the WrestleMania debut of former ECW founder, Paul Heyman. Amongst other things, this was the event that was the Apex of the Attitude Era.

Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho vs William Regal. This match was build-up from when Regal was assigned the Commissioner with each man trying to one-up the other when it came to insults including a hilarious segment involving Jericho & Regal's ""tea"". Early in the week, Regal had injured Jericho's shoulder so the story was that Jericho had to end the match early to have a chance which showed as Jericho was on the offense right away while delivering a reverse elbow from the top rope & a crossbody to the floor that tweaked the shoulder. Regal was able to work on the shoulder with an arm ringer & a shoulder takedown with Jericho feeling the effects to the point where he couldn't apply the Walls & hurt his shoulder while doing his Lionsault. This was a great opening match as they worked the story well regarding Jericho's shoulder while credit to Regal for taking some stiff chops during the match that caused his chest to be bleeding.

Acolytes & Tazz vs Right To Censor. Before the match, we got a glimpse of Bradshaw's ""JBL"" character on the mic while trying to fire up his team for this match. The backstory was that Jerry Lawler & the APA had their issues with the RTC but with Lawler quiting, Tazz was the other commentator that the RTC targeted. This started off as a brawl on the isle with even Jacqueline taking care of Stevie Richards in the ring. Once the match settled, RTC regained some offense by isolating Tazz from his teammates including whip Tazz so hard into the ropes he fell into them & knocked himself out for a bit before building the hot tag to Bradshaw. This match didn't go too long but it was a fun match for the time given while also showcasing Bradshaw & Jacqueline as the Texas natives.

Hardcore Champion Raven vs Kane vs Big Show. You could sense the direction this match was going to go once Raven came out & brought a series of weapons only to attack Kane at the start before Big Show even made his way into the ring leading to a scenario where Kane through Raven out of the ring onto Big Show only to deliver a clothesline from the top rope to the outside. From there, they went into the crowd with Kane & Show brawling amongst themselves with Raven just trying to escape before coming back with a metal sign. This got crazy from there with moments such as Kane throwing Raven through a glass window, Show throwing Kane through a door, Kane & Show battling through walls, Show & Raven crashing in a mini cart before Kane would join his own mini cart & referee almost running over Raven's leg, the Snapple concession stand being destroyed and Show & Raven being knocked off the WM stage with Kane taking advantage with a dive from the stage to win the title. Just a very entertaining & at times brutal match.

WWF European Champion Test vs Eddie Guerrero. Before the match, Saturn was at ringside wearing this funny hat that Jim Ross just couldn't take his eyes off. Test was using his power early on by throwing Guerrero around the ring with a series of slams before Eddie was able to take advantage of Test's mistake of getting caught in between the ropes with Saturn getting in some shots for measure. Eddie's strategy was to beat Test down whether it came to working over his knee or using wearing down holds like a sleeper before Test regained control with a series of powerbombs. However other allies of Eddie Guerrero had Test take his eyes off of Eddie allowing Eddie to do what he does best in ""Lying, cheating & stealing"". This was an average match as these two had a tough time clicking together at times during the match.

Kurt Angle vs Chris Benoit. Without including the UK Insurrextion PPV in 2000, this was their first high profile match but before the match, check out Kurt Angle's promo regarding the state of Texas. Angle got the takedown rightaway in the match with both men doing some amateur wrestling to start things off only to lead with a series of stalemates that even got the crowd to pop which was rare for it's time. Benoit started to get the better of mat-wrestling that allowed Angle to throw the first punch & taking the match to the outside, sending Benoit into the steps & the announce table. Both men traded momentum with a various suplexes & even attempting to apply their submission holds with each man finding a counter for each of their holds to the point where Benoit used the anklelock & Angle used the crossface. It took a cheap tactic that Paul Heyman referred to ""as using leverage"" for a winner to be declared but the important thing was that this was the beginning of what would be a classic rivalry based on in-ring wrestling alone as this was a wrestling clinic that left both men looking stronger than they did going in.

WWF Women's Champion Ivory vs Chyna. This was the rematch to their Royal Rumble match earlier in the year & the culmination to the months long feud between Chyna & the Right To Censor with the added stipulations being if Chyna was hurt, then there would be no legal recourse while the RTC was banned from ringside. Ivory was able to use the belt early & attempted to pound Chyna down. From there, Chyna dominated & squashed Ivory to the point where Chyna had the match won but picked Ivory up to deliver one final blow. This was the only flop of the night due to it being a squash but it really played out the way everyone was expecting.

Street Fight w/Special Referee Mick Foley: Shane McMahon vs Vince McMahon. This had a ton of side stories as the build up was Shane had bought WCW from under his father the previous week on RAW while on the same night, Mick Foley returned to announce that he was gonna referee this match despite the fact that Vince had fired Foley as Commissioner several months. Along with that during the time, Vince had divorced his wife Linda, placed her in a comatose state while having Trish as his mistress & Stephanie being in Vince's corner. Vince started the match aggressively by beating Shane down including one shot that caused a swelling on Shane's. Shane returned the favor with the use of a sign, kendo stick & a monitor before attempting to put Vince through the announce table till Stephanie making the save for Vince leading Shane to ""Crash & burn"". This match got completely out of control with the twist & turns in the angle with Trish coming out with Linda in a wheelchair only to show her true colors leading to a catfight with Trish, Vince taking out Foley with a chair before placing Linda in the ring to watch him beat down Shane with trash cans. However, it was that moment where Linda did something that not only shocked Vince but would hurt every man watching before Foley got some revenge allowing Shane to finish things off in an ""Extreme"" way. This match was tons better than it had any right to be as it played to everyone's strength in sports entertainment.

TLC II: WWF Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs Hardy Boyz vs Edge & Christian. Just based on the quality of matches that these three teams had during this time, you knew you can expect these three teams to steal the show. The Dudleys & Hardys singled out Edge & Christian early on before going after each other. From there, this was a highlight reel of a match with various moments occurring such as Edge & Christian doing something to Matt Hardy that had every man screaming, Jeff taking a double drop-toe hold onto a chair, Bubba putting Jeff through Edge through a table, all three teams fighting on individual ladders with Christian taking the worst of fall, the outside parties in Rhyno, Spike Dudley & Lita getting involved such as Spike putting Christian through a table, Rhyno goring everyone in sight including Matt Hardy through a table, Lita knocking Edge off the ladder & hitting Spike with a chair before paying for it in the end, Jeff delivering a Swanton from the largest ladder in the match onto Spike & Rhyno through tables, Matt & Bubba taking the high fall through the double stacked tables & the moment that everyone remembers most about this match in Edge spearing Jeff Hardy (who was hanging onto the belt hooks) off a twenty foot ladder. This lived up to the reputation that these teams established in this match.

Gimmick Battle Royal. Bobby Heenan & Mean Gene Okerlund returned to the WWF for the first time since '93 to do commentary for this match. The battle royal itself was pretty quick as the highlights were just seeing all the names from the past but the most entertaining parts of this one was Bobby & Gene having fun in their commentary such as making fun of the wrestlers,remembering Gene's encounter with the Gookleygooker, Heenan's remark towards Iron Sheik ""It will be WrestleMania 28 by the time he gets to the ring"", and the fun they were having when the Bushwackers licked Gene's hair (""What You Got Left...Both Of Them"") & that's even including who they were picking to win. This was just good old entertainment all the way through.

The Undertaker vs Triple H. This was their first big PPV match between these two that stemmed from Triple H claiming that he had defeated every big name in the company except one man in the Undertaker. However this one got personal in the coming weeks such as Taker being arrested, Triple H busting Taker open with a sledgehammer & even going as far as destroying Taker's bike. Taker went right after Triple H to the point where the Spanish announce table once again was destroyed. Triple H was able to regain offense by countering Taker's ""Old School"" before getting so frustrated that he ended up getting a sledgehammer. This one took a huge turn once the referee went down as both men continued the brawl into the crowd & onto the electrical equipment stand with moments such as Triple H beating the hell out of Taker with a chair & Taker chokeslamming Triple H off the stand onto the floor while taking the EMTs in the process. Once it settled back in the ring, the sledgehammer became a factor resulting in Taker getting busted open again but soon after sending Triple H onto his ""Last Ride"". Jim Ross quoted this match better than I can in saying ""What a hell of match"" & it was.

WWF Champion The Rock vs Stone Cold Steve Austin. We ended up getting a surprise in the opening announcement in that this match was going to be held under No Disqualifications. Austin came out to a hero's pop in his homestate of Texas while this was a foreshadowing for The Rock in the reaction he received here (and later on in the next WM). Austin jumped the match right from the get-go during Rock's entrance with both men even attempting their finishing moves before taking the action to the outside. They brawled around ringside, onto the announce table (which eventually did give), into the crowd & into the timekeepers table that resulted in Austin using the ringbell to his advantage in busting Rock open. Austin focused on the cut with various kicks & punches and even used his leg braces before losing his temper one too many times along Rock regain momentum & in the process, return the favor in busting Austin open with the ring bell. The intensity really started to pick up here as both men starting pulling out all the stops here including trading sharpshooters, stealing the other's finishing moves & false finishes left and right while also using the remains of the announce table such as the monitors. However the big story here was the appearance of Vince McMahon in doing something that not only shocked Rock but shocked the entire wrestling world as it was revealed that Austin & McMahon were joining forces with Austin just going absolutely crazy with his series of chair shots onto Rock. Jim Ross described this match on commentary as ""Off The Page Intense"" & he was right as this was the best Rock/Austin encounter based off the intensity & work alone with an ending that truly ended the Attitude Era.

DVD extras include bonus footage from RAW the next night, footage from WWF Fan Axxess & a bonus match from Sunday Night Head along with interviews as well.

WrestleMania is usually the biggest event of the year but this particular one stood out as the best of them all not only based off the fact that it ended an era but also the fact this event had just about everything from wrestling, brawling, entertainment, drama etc as this is one that I highly recommend needs to be in your collection.",1135814400,,12845,4.562635457303858

Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit

There can only be one first. There can only be one blueprint. WrestleMania 17 was the night where the whole Angle Benoit series started and what a match it was. A Very back and forth match that saw each man display what they're all about. Technical wrestling, submissions, high flying, brawling, false finishes. This match had it all but what really stands out in my mind about this match was the wrestling the two did at the beginning of the match. A Great Match by two phenomenal athletes. My only complaint is that the match had a weak ending. Match Rating 9/10

Match One-Intercontinental Championship-Y2J(C) Vs William Regal-Match was a good length but a little short. A good way to start Wrestlemania X7. This match was one of many in their solid feud. My rating 6/10.

Match Two-Tazz & APA Vs Right to Censor-This was a very short match. It was mainly served as a filler but it did involve a slight purpose. A good match for Right to Censor but I hope the APA get better matches then this in the coming months. My rating 5/10.

Match Three-Hardcore Title-Kane Vs Raven Vs Big Show(C)-This was a good triple threat hardcore match involving a good use of backstage area including a golf cart and many other objects in this match. Great match by all three and a good show of agility by the big men in the ending. My rating 7.5/10.

Match Four-European Championship-Test(C)Vs Eddie Guerrero-Nice match in my opinion some of you may hate it but i like it. Eddie is a great worker and test has quite a lot of potential. Eddie today cheats to win just like the old days. Eddie and test put on a great match, maybe not a classic but still a good match. My rating 8.5/10.

Match Five-Kurt Angle Vs Chris Benoit-This match was a classic, maybe not as good as Royal Rumble 2003 but this was still an excellent match. These two are two of the best workers in our business and deserve everything good. Keep this feud going i say. My rating 8.9/10.

Match Six-Womens Title-Ivory(C)VS Chyna-Why the hell was this on the show, it was just an absolute squash match. Absolute waste of time the time used on this could have been used on the six man tag match or another one. My rating 4/10.

Match Seven-Street Fight-Special Referee-Mick Foley-Shane McMahon Vs Vince McMahon-Shane signals out to some WCW wrestlers up in the stands. Shane and Vince battling it out for a while brawling with weapons and everything. Shane though he is not a professional wrestler can still do amazing spots. Good match all round. My rating 8.6/10.

Match Eight-Tag Titles-TLC II Match-Hardys Vs Dudleys(C)Vs Christian & Edge-This was an absolute spotfest with all the teams taking their fair share of bumps. This would have been a really really good match if Lita,Rhyno & Spike hadn't interfered causing this to be a bit of an over crowded match. My rating 7/10.

Match Nine-Gimmick Battle Royal Match-An absolute waste of time,went for a few minutes with a bunch of old wrestlers chucking guys over the rope then Sargeant Slaughter getting his revenge on the winner. Like the Womens match this could have been scrapped giving time to another match. My rating 4.5/10.

Match Ten-HHH Vs Undertaker-HHH had Motorhead play his entrance theme while he made his way to the ring and then Taker came speeding down the ramp at 50 Miles an hour with the crowd screaming. This match was a brawl with plenty of ref bumps, the usual Wrestlemania tombstone and lots of near falls. A very good match in my opinion. My rating 9/10.

Match Eleven-Main Event-No Disqualifications-WWF Title-Rock(C) Vs Stone Cold Steve Austin-This was an absolute great match. This was a great way to end this PPV. It had a huge surprise at the end and it was awesome. My rating 9.6/10.

8. Gimmick Battle Royal- even this match probably gets 3 stars.  It was cool to see some of the old timers have at it.  In fact they should have made it longer.

9.  Undertaker vs.  Triple H - GREAT MATCH.  This match shows what happens when the taker gets an opponent with talent.  These two guys put out an unbelievable performance.  Triple H literally gets choked slammed off a balcony and taker gets hit with a sledgehammer.  It is a privilege to give this match 5 *s.  CLASSIC

10.  Stone Cold vs. The Rock in a No DQ- It would be pretty hard to top the last few matches, but these two did just that.  See the WWE found itself in a bizarre situation.  Stone Cold acted like a bad guy and yet was loved by fans.  How do you turn someone like that heel? Have him sell out to Vince.  A surprise that leaves you speechless.

As I said, this is one Mania that does not disappoint.  At a minimum you get half a card that is not good, but great.",1113091200,,2503,4.206382978723404
1394618,5,B000055ZK9,"Let me go through the matches and I'll sum them all up at the end:

1. Chris Jericho def. William Regal to Retain his IC Title - Basic opener. Acually, it wasn't too bad, but nothing real memorable. Rating: 7/10

2. Tazz and Acolytes def. Right To Censor in a 6 man tag - The only real problem was because this match was way too short. I would have liked to see Farrooq get involved, but wasn't. Still nothing too bad, but definetly needed about 5 minutes more. Rating: 6/10 (for the time)

3. Kane def. The Big Show and Raven in a Hardcore Match - Awesome hardcore match. Had everything in it, from Kane throwing Raven through a glass window, golf carts, walls broken down by the 2 monsters, etc. Watch this match and you will see how good it is. Ending rocks too!! Rating: 9.5/10

4. Eddy Guerrero def. Test to win the European Championship - pretty basic match with these 2. Eddy rocks today and Test is gone from WWF so I don't know about this one. Rating: 7/10 (for Eddy being there :D)

5. Kurt Angle def. Chris Benoit - easily one of the top ten matches of all time at Mania events. Probably the best technical wrestling I've seen in a while. Rating: 10/10

6. Chyna def. Ivory to win the Women's Championship - pretty much a walk in the park for Chyna, pinning Ivory in 2 minutes with Ivory getting no offense in. Rating: 5/10

7. Shane McMahon def. Vince McMahon in the 'McMahon' Street Fight - AWESOME buildup to this match. Shane buying WCW right at the last RAW before Mania definetly added more heat to this match. Great spots from Shane with a Van Terminator and another spanish announce table drop. Rating: 10/10

8. Edge and Christian def. The Hardy's and Dudleys in a TLC match to win the Tag Team Championships - a contendor for the match of the night, but I know there are several matches of the night in this event. Watch this match and you will never ever forget it. All I'm giving away is that Edge speared Jeff from the top of the ladder. Rating: 10/10

9. The Iron Shiek wins the Gimmick Battle Royal - I don't know why everyone's saying this was such a bad match. It really wasnt, as this doesn't happen every pay-per-view. Let the old, retired people have some fun in a match, huh? Rating: 6/10 (was a bit boring though)

10. Undertaker def. Triple H - Taker is now 9-0 at WrestleMania's!! The match got very good at the camera area when Triple H got chokeslammed about 15 feet below! Watch this match, and really good buildup to it. Rating: 10/10

11. Stone Cold def. The Rock in a No DQ match to win the WWF Championship - awesome 28 minute match. Not one minute was wasted in this. Very intense match all of the 28 minutes. HUGE suprise/shocker at the end of the match is when Vince comes down and helps Austin win the belt. Quite possibly the match of the year. Rating: 11/10 (that was intentional, meaning this is one of my favorite matches in the WWF)

Extras aren't too much:

Next night on RAW with Triple H/Austin/Vince/Rock

Fan Axxess

Triple H/Undertaker at Fan Axxess

Some more but the other extras are forgettable

All in all, possibly the best WrestleMania ever. It featured everything with huge brawls, hardcore wresting, good technical wrestling, etc. Buy this event on DVD (right now!)so you can get the extras!!",1112745600,,3257,4.4379194630872485
1394619,5,B000055ZK9,"I will probably get stoned for this, but this Wrestlemania was not as good as everyone has made it out to be. WM X-8 was so much better, despite the calibur of the main event...X-7 has a bett main event by far...

Match #1 Chris Jericho (c) vs. Commisioner Regal for the IC Championship: Boring! But I can see why they'd open the show with this. Jericho retains his title, but why would Regal win if he was the commisioner anyways? 5/10

Match #2 Tazz & APA vs. Right to Censor: This could have been better if it was longer, but it was way too short. Tazz and Farooq barely got any ring time. Bradshaw beat RTC around a little bit, clothesline from hell, and that was that. Tazz and APA win. 6/10

Match #3 Raven (c) vs. Big Show vs. Kane for the Hardcore Championship: Not bad, but could have been better. What was lame about this match was that Raven didn't stand a chance against these two so everyone knew he would lose. Kane wins after throwing Show and Raven off the stage, then dropping a SICK leg drop on Show and pinning him! 7.5/10

Match #4 Eddie Guererro vs. Test (c) for the European Championship: One of the worst matches on the card. This match makes me wonder why no one liked Eddie back then and why everyone is all over his nuts now! He acts exactly the same! The crowd was so dead for this match it was crazy! Eddie wins with Malenko and Saturn's help and Test looked weak barely getting any offense in! STINK! 3/10

Match #5 Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle: Best match of the card so far! First match in these twos long history of matches. It was a great display of pure mat wrestling, but again not as good as everyone said it was. Their match at Royal Rumble '03 whipes the floor with this match. Angle wins with a hand full of tights! 8/10

Match #6 Ivory (c) vs. Chyna for the Woman's Championship: I was actually entertained by this eventhough it ended in like 2 or 3 minutes. Chyna pummeled Ivory all over the place and easily took her title. Not a good night for Right to Censor...Thank God!!! 7/10

Match #7 Vince McMahon vs. Shane McMahon in a Street Fight: Is it just me or is Shane like the king of street fights?! This was entertaining because of the drama behind it, not the actual match. There was no blood what so ever, but 2 sick bumps made up for it...Shane's leap of faith through the announce table and Shane doing a drop kick all the way across the ring planting a garbage can into Vince's face...oh and Linda punting Vince in the grapefruits! Mick Foley was SGR! Shane wins! 8.5/10

Match #8 E & C vs. The Hardyz vs. The Dudleyz (c) for the Tag Team Championships TLC 2: Another entertaining match, but not as good as their first triangle ladder match. What made this not as good was the constant interference by everyone...Rhyno, Spike, and Lita! Some cool spots...Spike gives Christian the Dudley Dog through a table, Rhyno gores Matt through a table, and the Dudleyz give Lita the 3D! Rhyno pushes Christian up the ladder allowing E&C to win the belts! 8.5/10

Match #9 Gimmick Battle Royal: This sucked! Worst match on the card! All these old timers who obviously couldn't wrestle anymore were in the ring and it just looked like the inside of a toilet bowl...crap! Iron Sheik wins this garbage in like 2 1/2 minutes! The entrances for everyone took like 4 times as long as the match...0/10

Match #10 HHH vs. Taker: Now we are getting somewhere! After taker flattened Mike Chioda, this turned into a street fight going all over the place! HHH took a 15' chokeslam, SICK! Taker wins with the last ride after HHH busted him open with the sledgehammer! AWESOME! 10/10

Match #11 Rock (c) vs. Austin for the WWF Title: Save the best for last, that's what I always say! This was announced as a No DQ match right when the superstars were making their entrances to the ring! Rock was getting his butt handed to him by the Rattlesnake at the beginning of this match and was busted open early! Stone Cold sells his soul to the devil, as McMahon gives Austin a chair and he DESTROYS Rock with the dang thing! The alliance we never thought we'd see was formed, Vince and Austin! After their victory, they celebrate with some beers as WM X-7 comes to a close...freaking CRAZYNESS!!! 10000000000/10

Overall not bad, but like I said see WM X-8 cuz it's better then this! Austin vs. Rock is probably the only thing that makes this mania better then X-8 because we know HHH vs. Jericho sucked! Oh and I'm a big fan of Paul Heyman, but he proved at how much he sucks at being an announcer here...his commentary was HORRIBLE! Too bad King was gone for this...",1112227200,,4584,4.411834319526627
1394620,5,B000055ZK9,"Some people think that this is the greatest show the Wwe has ever put on, but I can't agree.  Now, it is one of my favorites, most definately, but saying it's the greatest WrestleMania ever is pushing it.  See, comparing this to WrestleMania 3 is like comparing regular water to filtered water, it's close, but it's not the same.

Intercontinental Championship Match

-------------------------------------------

William Regal vs. Chris Jericho:  It was a good match, though it was very short.  If they were to extend the length of the match, it would have been much, much better.  Anyways, they both pulled off some nice moves and did a good job in the ring. 8/10

6 Man Tag Team Match

-------------------------------------------

APA and Tazz vs. Right to Censor:  Okay, i'll put it in simple terms, it sucked.  Tazz wasn't doing good in the ring and it was just short.  It sucked. 3/10

Hardcore Championship Match

-------------------------------------------

Raven vs. Big Show vs. Kane:  I didn't expect to much out of this match but a bunch of chokeslams, but I was wrong, big time.  This match was not only hilarious, but it was brutal.  This match was not only good for a laugh, but it was actually a great match. 8/10

European Championship Match

-------------------------------------------

Test vs. Eddie Guerrero:  Solid match, a few big moves, a few small moves here and there.  Test just doesn't really get my attention, and Eddie Guerrero is one of the best, so it wasn't a really good match to begin with. 5/10

Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit:  I was blown away by this match. One of the best WrestleMania matches ever, by far.  Both of these guys have a great wrestling background, and it shows in this match. 10/10

Womens Championship Match

-------------------------------------------

Ivory vs. Chyna:  This one blew, big time, even worse than the 6 man tag match. 2/10

Street Fight

-------------------------------------------

Shane McMahon vs. Vince McMahon with Mick Foley as Guest Referee:

I really don't know what to say about this match.  Vince took some bumps, Shane took some bumps, so it was back and forth.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good match, and they both did good jobs, so it was good. 9/10

TLC 2

-------------------------------------------

Dudley Boyz vs. Edge and Christian vs. Hardy Boyz:  What a match.  It was a very high flying, risk taking match, and these guys talent showed.  Jeff Hardy and Edge pulled off some sweet moves, like the Swanton bomb from that tall ladder and that sweet spear from the ladder.  Great match. 10/10

Gimmick Battle Royal

-------------------------------------------

Well, I enjoyed it. 7/10

Triple H vs. Undertaker:  Whoa!  This match was a wild one, and an unintentional street fight.  Best match of the night?  By far. 10/10

Wwe Championship Match

-------------------------------------------

The Rock vs. ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin:  After seeing WrestleMania 15, I knew this would be a good one.  It was made into a ""street fight"" at the last minute, and that made it even better.  It was a great match, but the shocker comes at the end of the match, and it still shocks me every time I see it. 10/10

What an event.  All the wrestlers did great jobs in, and out, of the ring, and made this one of the best ever, though not as good as WrestleMania 3. Altogether, I give it a 9.5/10",1111968000,,3370,4.910714285714286
1394621,5,B000055ZK9,"In my opinion, the greatest wrestlemania in history. It had everything from a great (huge & loud) crowd to a main event featuring the biggest stars of our or any other time.

All the matches were good but my top 5 are as follows

1. Rock v Austin - One of the greatest matches of all time

2. Angle v Benoit - A superb wrestling exibition, way better then their royal rumble match.

3. Shane v Vince - A trumendous effort by both men that did justice to a very interesting storyline going into this match.

4. HHH v Undertaker - first time these 2 badasses locked up. 10/10

5. TLC match - ruthless hardcore match, that on any other night, would of stolen the show.

1394624,5,B000055ZK9,"This Pay Per View had something for every type of wrestling fan. Firstly for those loyal fans who have watched WWE through the 80's, there was a legends battle royal, which although it didn't shape up to be an impressive match, the chance to see many WWE veterans back in the ring was a privalleged and rare opportunity.

 The Pay Per View finished off with two matches that the WWE fans were eager to see; the first ever showdown between The Undertaker and Triple H and a rematch between the Rock and Stone Cold since two years ago. We were starting to see signs of tension between the two superstars since Rebellion 2000.

 There may have been a few criticisms concerning the use of WWE talent on the match card. For instance, Kane and Big Show being demoted to a Hardcore Championship match up, an underrated use of two fine atheletes. Furthermore, Chris Jericho being placed in the opening match against William Regal arguably didn't help his career, since he had faced more admirable opponents the previous year.

 However, compared to the following Wrestlemania's and the awful match catch awaiting us for Wrestlemania 21, this Pay Per View is representative of the best year in WWE history. Enjoy!",1110931200,,1204,4.764423076923077
1394625,5,B000055ZK9,"Chris Jerico vs William Regal- what a way to start of the show with a good match. Jerico did a great job with this match but Regal held his own in this match. 7/10

APA & Tazz vs Val Venis Godfather and Bull Buchanean- Not evevn worth watching,a point less match that should have not been part of the show. 2/10

Raven vs Kane vs Big Show Hardcore Tittle Match- good hardcore match that had everything. Started in the ring then went to the back and that back to the area. Raven got throwen it to a glass window and Kane was driving a golf cart, it was great. 9/10

Eddie vs Test- okay match,eddie to me carryed the match and that waht made the match. Saturn and Dean came to help and this was an okay match 6/10

Chris Benito vs Kurt Angle- great wrestling match with to best wrestlers in the business and they should it this night and was a great match. Everything I expected and then some and it was worth it. 10/10

China vs Ivory- no,no,no,no, no point to this match it was not even that long and there was no point to this match. 0/10

Shane Mcmahon vs Vince McMahon- WOW great match by these two, all sorts of good bumbs in this match. Shane really put on all the stops in this match. Shane diving from the top of the rope in to the table. And I'll leave you with Shane going from one end of the ring to the other. (so buy this DVD) 10/10

TLC Match Hardy Boyz vs Edge & Christain vs Dudley Boyz- Another great match just as good as the first one. These guys work well together and do well in this match. Great momments in this match with Jeff Hardy doing the swanton bomb to bubba ray on the table. 10/10

Gimmick Battle Royal- it was entertaing to see all the old wrestlers there it was funny. 6/10

HHH vs The Undertaker- Taker returnes to his home town for a really good match. They go in to the crowd and fight and this match was very surprizing to me cause these to don't work that ofton together but they did a good job in this match. 10/10

Stone Cold Steve Austin vs The Rock- Best Match of the night and the greatest match these two have ever had. great stoyline behind this match and it was a great match with a great ending.

Wrestlemania 17 will live forever, and is perhaps the greatest Wrestlemania of them all. The card is so strong that it is hard to argue to deny this. There were 5*+ matches at Wrestlemania 17. Seriously, five superb matches! Take a look:

1394637,5,B000055ZK9,"I remember I paid well over 50 bucks for this dvd and call me crazy since they just released it on dvd again in the WrestleMaina set. True but I bought the dvd without the scratched out WWF logo. Its a great buy and probably one of the finest ppv's WWE has ever put on. 2001 was an excellent year for WWE. They just bought WCW so it had alot going for them (although it wouldnt turn out as fans hoped) and there rosters were stocked with top tier talent that would only rival TNA's and WWE Smackdown roster of 2002.

Chris Jericho VS William Regal: Two great wrestlers and Jericho sells his arm injury good. A good match but nothing speical.

APA and Tazz VS Right To Censor: A fun six man tag match. You knew who was going win anyways. Geez, Tazz is one short guy.

Raven VS Big Show VS Kane: I really miss this about the WWE. The hardcore divison brought alot of fun to the company and had some great matches. This match is funny and alot of cool spots thru out the match.

Test VS Eddie Guerrero: Never really liked Test. Decent match with Eddie winning with help from the Radicals.

Kurt Angle VS Chris Benoit: Good match between the two.

Ivory VS Chyna: Dont like women wrestling.

Shane McMahon VS Vince McMahon: Father and son don't always wrestle but when they do, they give it a 110%. Awesome street fight.

TLC 2: Dudley Boyz, Hardy Boyz, and Edge and Christian. Six men who never disappointed a crowd when any combo was against one anther. Christian and Edge win it with help from Rhyno.

Gimmick Battle Royal: Relive old days and see many wrestlers of the past; fun but nothing speical.

Undertaker VS Triple H: I love Motorhead and loved they sang live as Triple H came out. Undertaker wins in a great match.

Steve Austin VS The Rock: The company would change after this match. Great ending just too damn bad they couldn't keep the alliance thing going with better talent.

A great buy and alot of street fights for one PPV that isn't ECW.  Highly recommed this to any wrestling fan.",1107734400,,1998,4.382113821138211

Chris Jericho vs. William Regal

Great way to heat up the crowd.  Fast pace.  Good match.

APA & Tazz vs. RTC

Again, fast pace and the crowd was into it.  Just the right time too.

Hardcore Title

Raven vs. Big Show vs. Kane

Wow! They fought everywhere and there were a lot of great bumps taken by all 3.  Ballsy performance by Raven.  Great ending.

European Title

Test vs. Eddie Guerrero

Surprise match of the night.  Pretty good technical match.  I always felt Test was a bit underrated.

Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit

Amazing!  Just the first of many, many classic battles between these men.  No matter how many times they wrestle it's ALWAYS a 4 star match.

Women's Title

Ivory vs. Chyna

A squash but a rather entertaining one.  Especially considering Chyna's in it.

Street Fight

Vince McMahon vs. Shane McMahon with Mick Foley as special ref

Shane O'Mac is the man!  Great story, action, and even drama.  Crowd reaction is priceless.

TLC II Tag Team Title

Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian vs. Hardy Boyz

Even better than the first one.  Spectacular performances by everyone involved.

Gimmick Battle Royal

The best part was seeing who was in it.  Otherwise kinda crappy.

Undertaker vs. Triple H

What a brawl!  Much anticipated match since these two never wrestled on ppv before this.  Great match.

WWF Championship

The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin

What else can you say?!  The second best WM main event of all time.  So much intesity and drama between these guys.  This is what you expect from 2 of the greatest ever.",1105056000,3,1569,4.682835820895522

Chyna was indestructable in the women's division.  She faced Ivory at WrestleMania X-Seven and finished her off in short order with a powerbomb and a gorilla press slam.  Chyna held the championship until she left WWE at which point there was a six-way match to determine a new champion.",1104537600,,575,5.217391304347826

But for those of you who think that this ppv was only good for the TLC match and the Main event, believe me, there are a lot of other matches worth seeing.....

 Right To Censor vs. Tazz and the APA: Nowadays non of these guys  are wrestling anymore except Bradshaw and Steven Richards. This match was good and the crowd was well into the APA's corner since they were from Texas. Come back to wrestling Tazz! APA and Tazz win an okay match. 7.5/10

 Chyna vs. Ivory: I think if you compare Batista to Shannon Moore nowadays you will know what happened in this match [No offense to shannon moore.] Not that good and Chyna wins. 7/10

 Chris Jericho vs. William Regal - IC title match: Better than it looks on paper. Though it wasn't outstanding it did prove that they could wrestle together. Jericho wins and keeps his IC title for another month. Decent match. 7/10

Raven vs. Kane vs. Big Show - Hardcore Title Match: Wow, very good and very brutal. They fight inside and outside the ring and Kane and Big Show even knock each other through a wall. Raven gets thrown through a glass window. Tables were broken and guys were bleeding. Kane wins to become new champ. 8.5/10 [First great match of the night.]

Test vs. Eddie Guerrero - European title: Test dominated the entire time but the Radicalz come down [Perry Saturn and Dean Malenko] and help Eddie win to become the new champ. 7.5/10
So far about 75% of the titles have changed hands.

Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit: Have you seen their epic Royal Rumble 03 match? If so this is just like it, though slower paced in some spots, not that that is a bad thing. Incredible chain wrestling by both men and it even became one of the top ten best matches at a WM of all time. Kurt wins after rolling up Benoit and grabbing the tights. Really good match. 8.5/10 [Those of you who don't like actual wrestling as much might want to save this match after you've seen the street fights.]

Shane McMahon vs. Vince McMahon - Steet Fight: Think of it as a big soap opera [which it is] combined with Mick Foley and a catfight. Huge amounts of trash cans were used in this one. Shane even tries to give an elbow drop onto an announce table but misses after Stephanie McMahon pulls her father out of the way. Trish then slaps Vince and attacks stephanie. Vice attacks Foley, then Linda McMahon attacks Vince. Shane gives the Van Terminator to Vince to get the win. A good fight. 9/10

The Dudley Boyz vs. The Hardy Boyz vs. E and C - TLC 2: I don't agree with other reviewers. I think it was just as good as the first TLC match. Lots more interference on the outside on behalf of each team. Including Spike throwing himself and Christian through a table, Rhyno throwing Bubba Ray Dudley and Matt Hardy through four tables, and Lita attacking Edge and Christian.

Some highlights include Jeff Hardy giving a Swanton Bomb off a ladder onto Rhyno and Spike through tables, Bubba Ray and Matt going through four tables, and of course one of the best moves in history as Edge speared Jeff while he was hanging from the belts 20 feet above the ring! Edge and Christian win. 10/10

HHH vs. The Undertaker: This turned into a semi street fight after the ref was knocked unconscious within the first ten minutes. They fight in the crowd and onto a tower filled with monitors and cameras. HHH knocks taker around with a chair, then Taker chokeslams HHH over the side and into the crowd.

They go back into the ring and HHH cracks the sledgehammer over Takers face, but taker kicks out. Taker then gives the last ride for the win. An okay match, but the ref being unconscious all that time wasn't that believable. 8.5/10

20 man ""old school"" Battle Royal: This was shorter than all their entrances combined. It was okay but definately was just there to entertain the crowd. The Iron Shiek wins. 7/10

The Rock vs. Stone Cold - No Disqualification for the WWE Belt: Out of their three matches at WM, this is the best they ever put one. Both men get cut open, an announce table was broken, each use the others own finishing moves and the biggest surprise of them all came last when Vince McMahon comes down and helps stone cold win the belt.

You could tell that the crowd didn't really care because they were too busy cheering the fact that stone cold was champion no matter what. Stone Cold begins his fifth reign as champion. 9.5/10

Overall this is the best WM of them all. It has a variety of matches for all sorts of viewers. I personally liked the TLC match and Kurt vs. Benoit, but that is just my opinion. Also, this is really hard to find on DVD, it took me 4 months to find this, so start now!",1103500800,2,4774,4.398410896708286

The Rock v. Stone Cold Steve Austin  World Title

  BOOOOOO!!!!!  This match stunk especially with Vince helping Austin win the title so DUMB!!!**",1100304000,,1698,4.494949494949495
1394642,3,B000055ZK9,"Many people claim that this was the greatest ppv of all time, but i don't understand how, true there were some highlights but otherwise much of the card wasn't very special especially the main event. I have been a major wrestling brain for years, i even gave up on the whole business after WCW got bad because with McMahon the top guy, you may as well look at it as the George W. Bush of ""sports entertainment"" onto the card

As always Vinny Mac has to use the mainstream crap music to create his opening promo's, todays juke box selection Limp Bizkit ""My Way""

Intercontinental Title Match- Chris Jericho def. William Regal

Decent Match but pretty short, just under 8 min. Should have given these guys more time and less from the Main Event and Street Fight, could have been a classic, but god forbid Vinnie ever let the spotlight off him at the largest stage...6/10

6-Man Tag Team Match- APA and Tazz def. Right To Suck

To bad Val Venis went from being massively over with the crowd to part of a failure stable, basicall tazz is in the majority until he hot tags Bradshaw who cleans house, Farooq comes in to help fend off the Business suit pansies...Bradshaw wins with the CFH..(and I don't mean Cowboys From Hell either) 3/10

Hardcore Match- Kane def Bigshow and Birdboy to win the title

Well Isaac Yankem, the Giant and Johnny Polo give us the typical jarble in this one...didn't waste my time on this one too much 3/10

note: Remember when Raven could have been a dominant force in WCW especially in 99 when he was super over, then they canned him, I do...1 of the 6 major players WCW would lose and ultimately pay the price in the end

Gyro Title Match- Eddie Gurrero def Kevin Na...i mean Test.

Well Eddie carries Little Sexy to a decent match but not enough to impress me...5/10

Single Match- Kurt Angle def. Chris Benoit

not as good as the Rumble 03 match but the match of the night in my book. Both guys use a lot of mat wrestling and grappling, tons of counters as well, each guy even utilizes the others finisher (i wonder if the main eventers were watching this match, more on that later) anyways Angle uses the tights to pin Benoit...8/10

Womans Title Match- Chyna def. Ivory

yep, it sucked 0/10

Street Fight- Shane-O Mac def. Vince ""Can't sell a single move or throw a decent looking punch"" Mcmahon.

starts off as an all out brawl, looking pre-tty good to me so far, Steph gets involved (she's gorgeous). Shane goes for an elbow off the top rope on to Vince who is on the Spanish Announce table but Steph pulls Daddy out of the way, Shane crashed through and for the next 10 minutes is pretty much out cold, so to kill time Trish brings out Mamma Mc in her wheelchair (she's been sedated on drugs.........LAME) doing a lame job at acting period, Trish turns on Vince, Trish and Steph fight to the back, Shane gets tossed in the ring, Vin pounds him with numerous trash cans linda gets up and in a clearly forgotten spot by Vin Man has to spread his legs while standing so linda can kick his McMahons...

what happened was linda stands up vince turns around but his legs are too close together and for a quick second they chit chat, and vince spaces his legs......GOOD ONE VINCE!

long story short the most incredible move of the night happens when Shane jumps from ringpost to ringpost and nails daddy with a dropkick into a trashcan...the match gets a 5/10...shane's move 10/10

TLC 2- E&C def the Dummy Brothers and the Hardly Boys...

good match but too much like the first one but this time lita, spike, and rhyno play a role in this one, match turns into chaos in the end with people being taken out, ending comes when d-von and edge are trying to climb and get the belts and rhyno climbs up under edge and boosts him up to get the belts. Good Match Lame Ending. 9/10 pretty hot crowd tonight!

Gimmick Battle Royal- Iron Shiek wins.

very short, the crowd so badly wanted Doink to win and when he got tossed major boo's for that one (That's Vince for you) After Shiek wins big fat Sarge Slaughter comes in and puts on a sloppy Cobra Clutch for the win.....go back to G.I Joe I say...5/10 only cause Bobby Heenan was commenting and giving us his great wisdom

Grudge Match- Undertaker def. Triple H

First thing I said when I saw this match coming up, oh good Son in Law v.s the man of 6 moves. Match is basically a brawl, ref goes down early from a kick, must have been brutal seeing how he was out for so long, Over the hill taker chokeslams Triple H off a scaffold in the crowd! oh nevermind massive cushioned pads were below. Blade job from Taker won't impress me late in the match. 6/10 crowd was hot hot hot for this one

No DQ WWF Title Match- SCSA def. The Rock

so this is the one people thought was so great, all we see is punch punch punch punck x10000, each guy does the others moves, didn't we see that with angle/benoit, oh who cares they aren't good enough for vince, blade jobs from each, Rock seems to have botches his first blade attempt as no blood really comes out, as well as he crawls on the announce table and it falls apart, oops thats two for Rocky, basically we get a survior series 96 attempt when Stunning Steve uses the million dollar dream on the Crotch, and Crotch does an awful pushing off the turnbuckles with his feet almost blowing the move to try and get the pin, anyways Vince comes out, Austing turns on Rock beats him silly with a Chair, claims the title to no one's suprise, but in a shocking twist joins forces with Vince....2/10...less punch more crunch next time

well there you have it, the not so great ppv, sorry but after Austin broke his neck he had that same spark, he went from a great technician to your typical kick punch its all in the mind dude, as for the Rock, stay out of Hollywood and get some more ring skill. Adios DUDES!!!!!!!!!",1099440000,2,5822,4.386617100371748

TRIPLE THREAT HARDCORE CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH
RAVEN (c) VS. KANE VS. BIG SHOW
OH MY GOD.  I LOVE HARDCORE MATCHES.  THIS WAS A GREAT ONE.  THEY END UP IN THE BACKSTAGE FOR 80% OF THE MATCH.  RAVEN GETS THROWN THROUGH GLASS!  BIG SHOW AND KANE RUN EACH OTHER OVER THROUGH A WALL!  RAVEN WAS A HUGE UNDERGOD, AND ALMOST GOT THE WIN.  IN THE END, KANE JUMPS FROM THE STAGE INTO A BOX THING, AND LANDS ON BIG SHOW TO WIN THE WWF HARDCORE TITLE.
9/10

WWF EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP
TEST (c) VS. EDDIE GUERRERO
PRETTY FAST PACED MATCH.  TEST DOMINATES MOST OF THE MATCH.  IN THE END, PERRY SATURN COMES DOWN AND SO DOES DEAN MALENKO.  TOGETHER, THE THREE OF THEM SCREW TEST OUT OF THE TITLE.  EDDIE WINS AND IS THE NEW CHAMP.
7/10

KURT ANGLE VS. CHRIS BENOIT
OH MY GOD.  THIS WAS A WONDERFUL MATCH.  IT STARTED AS AN AMATUER STYLE MATCH, BUT TURNED INTO A BRAWL AND THEN INTO AMATUER STYLE AGAIN.  BOTH MEN USE THEIR HOLDS AND LOTS OF COUNTERING.  CRAPPY ENDING THOUGH WITH ANGLE GRABBING THE TIGHTS TO WIN.  HOWEVER, TOTAL GREATNESS!
10/10

WWF WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP
IVORY (c) VS. CHYNA

SHANE O' MAC VS. VINCE MCMAHON!
SON VS. FATHER.
MIC FOLEY AS SPECIAL GUEST REFEREE!
STARTS OFF WITH VINCE SLAPPING SHANE, THEN SHANE KICKING VINCE'S BUTT ALL OVER THE RING.  VINCE ENDS UP ON THE SPANISH ANNOUNCE TABLE, AND SHANE ATTEMPTS TO DROP HIS ELBOW THROUGH VINCE THROUGH THE TABLE.  SHEPHANIE MCMAHON HOWEVER GRABS VINCE AND SHANE GOES THROUGH ALONE.  LINDA IS PUSHED DOWN TO THE RING BY TRISH.  VINCE GOOFS AROUND WITH HER AND BRINGS HER IN THE RING ON A CHAIR.  VINCE HITS FOLEY WITH A CHAIR IN THE PROCESS.  TRISH TURNS ON VINCE AND HER AND STEPHANIE FIGHT EACH OTHER INTO THE BACK.  THAT LEAVES SHANE, VINCE, FOLEY AND LINDA.  LINDA THEN RISES AND KICKS VINCE IN THE ""GRAPEFRUITS"".  FOLEY COMES IN AND STARTS BEATING ON VINCE INTO THE CORNER, AND SETS A TRASH CAN ON HIM.  SHANE O'MAC THEN COASTS TO COASTS FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER INTO THE TRASH CAN, AND GETS THE 1,2,3 ON VINCE.

TLC 2 FOR THE WWF TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS!
THE DUDLEY BOYZ (c) VS. THE HARDY BOYZ VS. EDGE AND CHRISTIAN
WOW!WOW!WOW!  LOTS OF HIGH RISK LADDER MOVES IN THIS MATCH, AND LOTS OF BODIES GOING THROUGH TABLES!  LOT'S OF ""HOLY S#!*"" MOMENTS IN THIS MATCH!  MY FAVOURITE WAS WHEN EDGE SPEARS JEFF HARDY FROM A LADDER!  RHYNO COMES IN TO HELP EDGE AND CHRISTIAN, SPIKE FOR THE DUDLEYZ, AND LITA FOR THE HARDYZ.  I WISH THESE 3 WOULDN'T HAVE COME IN.  THEY MADE THE MATCH KINDA BAD.  RHYNO IS THE CONTRIBUTING FACTOR, PUSHING BUBBA RAY AND MATT THROUGH 4 TABLES OUT OF THE RING!  HE THEN PUSHES CHRISTIAN UP THE LADDER, AND EDGE AND CHRISTIAN ARE THE NEW TAG CHAMPS!

GIMMICK BATTLE ROYAL!
THIS WAS AN OVER THE TOP ROPE BATTLE ROYAL FEATURING ABOUT 20 OLD SKOOL SUPERSTARS.  PRETTY FAST BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL SO OLD.  IN THE END, IRON SHEIK ELIMINATES SGT. SLAUGHTER TO WIN.  THE ""WEASEL"" AKA ""THE BRAIN"" AKA BOBBY HEENAN AND MEAN GENE ARE GUEST COMMENTATORS.  7/10 BECAUSE IT WAS FUNNY TO SEE THEM ALL 15 YEARS LATER.

UNDERTAKER VS. HHH
THIS MATCH GOT UGLY IN A HURRY.  THE REF GETS KNOCKED OUT AND THEN ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE!  THINK OF IT AS NO HOLDS BARRED WHEN THE REF WAS OUT.  THEY TAKE IT INTO THE CROWD, AND UNDERTAKER CHOKESLAMS HHH FROM A STAGE OF SOME SORT.  THEY BOTH GET BACK IN THE RING, WHERE UNDERTAKER DOES A LAST RIDE.  HOWEVER, IN THE MIDDLE OF IT, HHH HITS HIM WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER, BUT UNDERTAKER KICKS OUT WHEN THE REF RECOVERS.  UNDERTAKER EVENTUALLY GETS A LAST RIDE WHEN THEY ARE IN THE CORNER.  UNDERTAKER WINS!

The matches were unique in their own way there was something special about this night the match card was amazing, all was on the line. All championships changed in a brilliant way we crowned new champions, we stood in amazement in what we were seeing.

In my opinion there was 5 matches that stood out matches that were miraculous to our eyes. What were they? Let me remind on the night of April 1ST 2001 Houston,Reliant Astrodome not in particular order, all brilliant

Some people prefer matches like the rock v mankind I quit Royal Rumble... in that they hit each over with microphones...not as much talent as Kurt V Chris. I prefer Kurt to Chris because he can make anyone look good. If you want a good ppv from 2001 get No Mercy, No Way out...",1093132800,,402,4.10126582278481
1394669,5,B000055ZK9,"Best wrestling PPV ever?  That was the heavily debated question after this PPV.  If it wasn't the best ever, it was darn near close.  Wrestlemania 17 is a 2 disc set.  Disc 1 and part of 2 contains the matches and the rest of 2 is extras.

1. Chris Jericho vs. William Regal (Intercontinental Championship)

These two built up quite the comical fued before this match.  Good match.  Good way to open up the show.  (7.5/10)

2. APA & Tazz vs. Right To Censor

Nothing really happened in this match.  Right To Censor is horrible.  (5/10)

3. Kane vs. Raven vs. Big Show (Hardcore Championship - Triple Threat)

Very entertaining match that went all over the arena.  Good bumps taken by Raven (thrown through glass, hit by a golf cart).  Very good finish to the match as all 3 men take good bumps.  (8.5/10)

4. Test vs. Eddie Guerrero (European Championship)

Surprisingly entertaining match from Test.  The match is pretty short.  (7.5/10)

5. Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit

Another technical classic between these two.  Starts up as a pure wrestling match.  This was actually voted as the 10th best Wrestlemania match by WWE superstars before Wrestlemania 20.  These two have such great chemistry together.  Bad ending.  (9/10)

6. Chyna vs. Ivory (WWF Womens Championship)

Who cares?  (1/10)

7. Shane McMahon vs. Vince McMahon w/Mick Foley as Special Guest Referee (Street Fight)

Very, very exciting match.  The crowd was into this match from the beginning.  Amazing.  Crazy bumps taken by both men.  Shane jumps off the top rope through an announce table, and also delivers a Van Daminator to Vince with the use of a trash can.  There are many surprising twists and turns that occur during this match.  (9.5/10)

8. Edge & Christian vs. Hardy's vs. Dudley's (Tag Team Championship - TLC)

One of the best matches of the year, although it is not exciting as TLC I.  It is still great in its own right.  Spike Dudley, Rhyno, and Lita all make appearances in this match.  To many crazy spots and bumps to note.  Watch for the Edge spear off the ladder on Jeff hanging from the belt.  Maybe the best move ever.  (9.5/10)

9. Gimmick Battle Royal

This match featured past WWF superstars.  Good nostalgia.  (8/10)

10. Triple H vs. Undertaker

This match was not a Street Fight, but turned into one when the ref gets knocked out.  The match spills into the crowd.  Triple H takes a good bump getting choke slammed off a scaffold.  Very exciting ending.  (9/10)

11. The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin (WWF Title - No DQ)

Great match.  Match of the year in my opinion.  These two really went at it.  There is a lot of blood, reversals, and close falls.  Great finish, although very surprsing.  Great match.  (10/10)

The extras on disc 2 are the normal interviews, superstar moments, and RAW the next night.

I definately recommend picking this up, although it is very hard to find and expensive.  Definately one if not the best PPV ever.

1394673,5,B000055ZK9,"The 17th annual Wrestlemania extravaganza broke more ground in 2001 than ever.  Here is WWF at its prime, with the best superstars, and the best matches.
The opening match is the Intercontinetal Championship match between the champion Chris Jericho, & William Regal.  The match is farely quick paced and is won by Jericho with a Lionsault pin.  The second match is a 3 man tag team match between the APA, Tazz & Jaqueline at ringside vs. Right to Censor.  Ok match.  The highlight for me is when Jaqueline gets in the ring & DDT's Val Venis.  Match is won by Bradshaw with the Clothesline From Hell
A Hardcore Championship Match is next pitting to super heavy weight, Big Show & Kane, against the champion Raven.  Pretty decent hardcore match featuring shattered windows, blood, & even a couple of golf carts.  Kane wins with a spectacular leg drop on Big Show.  Next is two of the all time greats in a awesome match.  Chris Benoit, & Kurt Angle truly give the fans there money's worth.
The most forgetable match of the night is a European Championship match between champion Test, against Eddie Guerrero.  Guerrero wins in true heel fashion by cheating with a distraction from Dean Malenko.  The 9th world wonder, Chyna is next, beating the hell out of Women's Champion Ivory.  Ivory doesn't stand a chance and loses the belt in record time.
One of the best matches of the night belongs to Vince McMahon & Shane McMahon in a brutal Street Fight.  This match truly tells a story with a wide variety of superstars including guest referee Mick Foley, Stephanie McMahon, Trish Stratus, & Vince's wife Linda McMahon extracting her ultimate revenge.
Match of the night belongs to 3 young tag teams in the second ever TLC(Tables, Ladders, & Chairs) match.  The Hardys, Edge & Christian, & the Dudleys give a spectaculor match that went down in history as one of the best.
The 1st main event of the night pits Triple H against the phenom himself, The Undertaker.  This match basically turns into a hardcore match when Taker knocks the referee out.  Taker keeps his winning Wrestlemania streek alive with a vicious Last Ride to HHH.
The main event is a WWF Championship match against Champion The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Great match starting the Steve Austin heel stage.
Extras on the DVD include and extra match from Sunday Night Heat.  Steve Blackman & Grand Master Sexay vs. X-Pac & Justin Credible.  Also the DVD shows the wrestlemania aftermath on the next nights RAW.  GReat DVD, & great pay per view.",1086998400,,2510,4.724137931034483

TLC match
I thought it was an average PPV.
Overall I enjoyed it very much.
Not the best WM though.",1086220800,,392,4.297297297297297

Intercontinental Title - Chris Jericho V William Regal
A solid opener, which got the crowd interested. It had a good pace and a nice ending. 7/10
RTC V APA and Tazz
This wasn't really a very good match, but it was nice to see RTC getting beaten up! 6/10
Hardcore Title - Raven V Big Show V Kane
This was a fantastic hardcore match, with only a few seconds of it happening in the ring. They go backstage, where the use various weapons and smash through a door, a glass window, and even a wall. The ending is also great! 9/10
European Title - Test V Eddie Guerrero
Pretty solid match, although one of the worst of the night. 6/10
Kurt Angle V Chris Benoit
If you like technical matches, this is an easy 10/10 match. I don't like them that match, but I still enjoyed this. 7/10
Women's Title - Ivory V Chyna
This was crap  really, but it was saved by it's shortness and the fact that Ivory (part of RTC at the time) got kicked in! 5/10
Street Fight - Vince McMahon V Shane McMahon
A brilliant brawl, with weapons including signs and trash cans. Also, Shane jumps right through the Spanish announce table. The best part however was when Linda got up and kicked Vince in the balls. The crowd reaction at that point was fantastic! 9/10
Tag Team Titles Tables Ladders and Chairs (TLC II)
The Dudley Boyz V The Hardy Boyz V Edge & Christian
This was absolutely AMAZING! Match of the night! The moves are incredible, including a Swanton off an amazingly high ladder, and Matt and Bubba going through 4 tables on the outside of the ring from a ladder pushed over from inside. Also Lita, Spike and Rhyno all come in, making it even better. Loads of tables break, there are some great chair shots and some brilliant ariel moves off ladders. An incredible match, one of the best matches I've ever seen. 10/10
Gimmick Battle Royal
The entrances are actually longer than the match. It's just a bit of fun really, not a proper match. Some old commentators announce it. Not a match, but funny and entertaining, and it was a good way of calming the crowd. No Rating since it wasn't really a proper match.
Triple H V Undertaker
The Ref get knocked out for ages, and they fight through the crowd and up to the camera tower, where Triple H is chokeslammed from. When they get back to the ring Triple H hits an amzing Sledgehammer shot on Undertaker, and the end is fantastic. A great match. 9/10
WWE Title - The Rock V Stone Cold Steve Austin
The main event of the best event of all time, and it lived up to the hype! It's cool when the match is introduced, as they announce that it will be No DQ, getting a great crowd reaction. The match is amazing, neither man will stay down. The use finishers, they use eachothers finishers, the use weapons, but they just keep kicking out! In the end Austin hits Rock with a chair masses of times to keep Rock down. After the match, Austin and Vince shake hands, an incredible ending, absolutely unbelievable! 10/10
Overall
Wrestlemania X7 is not only the best Wrestlemania ever, but the best wrestling event EVER! Nothing more needs to be said!",1085961600,,3091,4.441901408450704
1394676,5,B000055ZK9,"The three words ""of all time"" get thrown around a lot in this day and age, and I am not innocent of constantly uttering them myself, in effect watering down their significance. But when I say that Wrestlemania X7 is the greatest Wrestlemania -- even greatest PPV -- OF ALL TIME, I am not exaggerating. Everything from the opening montage to the post-main event celebration was electric live on PPV and none of that electricity is lost on DVD.
This was a Wrestlemania that WWF needed to succeed, what with the failure of the previous year's Wrestlemania 2000. The WWF attained that success with X7, in everything from the card to live attendance to PPV buys. Most of the matches had well built storylines and were just great matches in themselves. Another treat was the Gimmick Battle Royal featuring special appearances by the always-welcome Bobby Heenan and Mean Gene.
One aspect to this PPV that made it such a success was the diversity of the card. Wrestlemania 2000 was bogged down in tag team matches, triple threats and unproven wrestlers. X7, however, had something for everyone. Technical wrestling fans will drool over Benoit vs. Angle for years to come. Hardcore fans love the TLC II match. Fans of the over-the-top storylines were into the father vs. son match. And fans of the industry's top two stars at the time, Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock, will always remember fondly their main event that night on April Fool's day in 2001.
The DVD extras aren't much, but what do you need with extras when the PPV event itself gives you one hell of a show? Even with all of the positives on this show, there are some negatives. In the aformentioned father vs. son match, fans did not react well to Shane's WCW allegiance and this slightly took away from the impact of his win over Vince, although it was more Linda McMahon's win than Shane's. Also, some of the other matches just didn't click for whatever reason. Although a very decent opener, Regal vs. Jericho was a bit off, as the latter was going 100MPH and Regal just didn't seem to be in key that night. Chyna vs. Ivory was an atypical squash match akin to those we used to see on WWF Superstars in the late 80's. But one of the greatest advantages DVD has over VHS is the ability to go to the next scene instantaneously at the press of a button.

1394677,5,B000055ZK9,"If you are looking for a Wrestlemania to get on DVD, Wrestlemania 17 should be at the top of your list. There were 11 matches and 6 titles on the line. A night no one can or will ever forget, with 4 main event caliber matches and a ending that shocked the world.
1. WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Chris Jericho (c) vs. William Regal (WWF Commissioner); There was a great build up to the match and I think it should have happened later in the event. It was still a great opener and Chris Jericho was able to win. 8/10
2. 6 Man Tag Team Match: APA and Tazz vs. Right To Censor; A good match with lots of action. APA and Tazz win thanks to a Clothesline from Hell. 7/10
3. Triple-Threat Match for the WWF Hardcore Championship: Raven (c) vs. Big Show vs. Kane; One of the best if not the best hardcore match I have ever seen. Incredible action throughout the match and a great ending in which Kane picks up the victory. 10/10
4. WWF European Championship Match: Test (c) vs. Eddie Guerrero; It should have been the opener, but the action was decent. Eddie steals another match thanks to his friends. 7/10
5. Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit; A great wrestling match. Both men wanted to make the other tap out and it ended in a rollup and Angle victory. 9/10
6. WWF Women's Championship Match: Ivory (c) vs. Chyna; Ivory did not stand a chance it was all Chyna. A short match and a easy win for the new Women's Champion Chyna. 6/10
7. WWF Street Fight Match: Shane McMahon vs. Mr. McMahon with Mick Foley as special guest referee; A awsome match with a surprise in the middle and a great move at the end that lead to Mr. McMahon being beat by his own son Shane. 10/10
8. WWF T.L.C 2 Tag Team Champioship Match: Dudley Boyz (c) vs. Edge and Christian vs. Hardy Boyz; A great match. Almost every move was awsome and unbelievable. A match for the ages with Edge and Christian wining. 10/10
9. Gimmick Battle Royal: featuring Nikolai Volkoff, Kamala, Kimchee, Iron Sheik, Sgt. Slaughter, Repo Man, Earthquake, Gobbledy Gooker, The Goon, Tugboat, One Man Gang, Hillbilly Jim, Brother Love, Doink The Clown, Duke Droese, Freebrid Michael Hayes, Jim Cornette, and The Bushwhackers (Luke and Butch); A fun match to see people were gone quickly and the Iron Sheik won. 8/10
10. Triple H vs. Undertaker; A unbelievable match. Both men put it all on the line. The second best match of 2001 and Wrestlemania history. The only match better than this one was the main event of this Wrestlemania! 10/10
11. WWF Championship Match: The Rock (c) vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin; The best match I have ever seen. Both men were bleeding a great amount and were beating the hell out of each other. This match has an ending you will not believe and it caped off the best Wrestlemania I have ever seen. 10/10
The World Wrestling Federation out did themsleves on April 1, 2001 in The Houston Astrodome with the thrid largest crowd in Wrestlemania history of 67,925 people. Wrestlemania 17 in my opinion is the best event in WWF history. 100/100",1080000000,,3018,4.509124087591241

1394679,5,B000055ZK9,"I have been a loyal fan of the WWE for the last ten years, and in all the time that I have been watching, Wrestlemania 17 is by far the greatest WWE ppv that I have ever seen. Most WWE pay-per-views feature a few great matches combined with mainly average to mediocre matches. Wrestlemania 17 is the only WWE show I have ever seen that did not have one bad match on the card. In fact, many of the wrestlers that participated in Wrestlemania 17 put on the matches of their careers.
The PPV basically had something for everyone. For fans of the classic mat style of wrestling, you got to see Chris Benoit vs Kurt Angle which are argulably two of the greatest wrestlers alive today. For those fans who are into hardcore matches and the extreme attitude of the WWE, the TLC II match featuring The Dudley's, Edge and Christian, and the Hardy Boys is guaranteed to leave you satisfied. For those fans who just want to see an all out brawl, Stone Cold vs The Rock, and Triple H vs The Undertaker will make you very happy. Perhaps the most suprising match of the night was Shane McManon facing the owner of the company and his father no less, Vince McManon in a street fight. Shane and Vince both put on one hell of a performance, considering the fact they are not full time wrestlers.
If you are a fan of the WWE, there is no way you can pass this up. Wrestlemania is always the biggest PPV of the year, and Wrestlemania 17 managed to somehow be even bigger than the rest of them.

Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho def. William Regal
A good opener for a Wrestlemania with a unexpected ending with a small lionsault by Y2J to get the three. Overall ***
APA & Tazz def. RTC
Not a very good match that was slow. It had a nice ending with a huge clothsline on Goodfather to get the three. Every man takes a beating, also Steven Richards gets ddt'd by Jackie. **
Kane def. Raven & Big Show for the Hardcore Title
A great, huge Hardcore match with a huge ending when Kane leaped off the stage and legdropped Big Show for the 3. A huge frenzy back stage and there is no way I could give this match less than *****
Eddie Gurrero def. Test for the European Title
A decent match with a bad ending when Malenko was distracting the ref and Saturn threw the European Title to Eddie and Eddie nailed him to get the 3. ***
Kurt Angle def. Chris Beniot
A great pure wrestling match that deserves more than five stars except for the ending where Angle got a roll up and held the tights to get the 3. **** 1/2
Chyna def. Ivory
A short, bad match that should have been on Raw or something because this was short! The only reason the match went on is because Chyna lifted up Ivory and did a gorilla press slam to get the 3. **
Shane McMahon def. Vince McMahon
An awesome street fight and even better because Trish turned on Vince and  slapped him in the face! The best street fight I have ever seen! MUST SEE! *****
Edge & Christian def. Hardy Boyz & Dudley Boyz in TLC 2
Another awesome match that is a MUST SEE. Rhyno was a huge difference maker in this match! I shouldn't spoil you with the details but let me say this, Matt & Bubba Ray's carrer almost came to an end. *****
Iron Shiek won the Gimmic battle royal
A decent match with all the old superstars with a gimmic. The eliminations were as quick a a snap though! At the end of the match Sgt. Slaughter had the Cobra Clutch on Shiek. ***
Undertaker def. Triple H
A awesome brawl after the ref got knocked out by the Undertaker. They took it to the place where Moterhead played Triple H's them song. The ending came when HHH was punching UT on the middle rope and UT lifted him up for the last ride and finally got the 3. *****
Stone Cold def. The Rock for the WWE Championship
A great brawl but who the heck  made it No Disqualification match!? Anothe super match until the end where Austin murdered The Rock with the chair until Rock finally gave it up. Shame on you Austin! *****",1073952000,,3124,4.360344827586207

Chris Jericho vs. William Regal: An alright match, but Jericho is capable of so much more. 5/10
The Right To Censor vs. Tazz and the A.P.A.: You really don't expect that great of a match when it features these guys in it. My assumptions are correct and the match isn't that good. 1/10
Raven vs. Kane vs. Big Show: A pretty good match that featured lots of nice bumps from Raven. 5/10
Eddie Guerrero vs. Test: A suprisingly good match. 6/10
Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit: When you get both Angle and Benoit in the same ring, you know you're in for a mat classic and an awesome match. They did just that here. 8.5/10
Ivory vs. Chyna: The worst match of the night as Chyna basically just squashed Ivory. 0/10
Vince McMahon vs. Shane McMahon: 7/10
The Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian vs. The Hardy Boyz: 10/10
Gimmick Battle Royal: Good for nostalgic purposes, but otherwise it was pretty rushed. 1.5/10
Undertaker vs. HHH: 4.5/10
Steve Austin vs. The Rock: 9.5/10

Jericho saves the match because lets face it Regal is a show killer. Good match not the best but great ending. ***
2. 6 man tag: APA & Tazz vs. Right To Censor
Short and sweet. Tazz gets his butt kicked in this one but it has another great ending. ***
3. Triple threat Hardcore Title: Raven vs. Kane vs. Big Show
Amazing Hardcore title match. Gets the show started. Most of the match is back stage so you can't really hear the crowd. People go through glass, walls and off the stage in this one. *****
4. European Title: Test vs. Eddie Guerrero
More of a Raw or Smackdown match but is worth the watch. ***
5. Single match: Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit
Amazing technical wrestling in this one. Slow start but serves its purpose. Almost a perfect match lasting the right amount of time. *****
6. Womens Title: Chyna vs. Ivory
Lasted about 1 minute. Very short which is nice. **
7. Gimick Battle Royal:
Alot of old wrestlers in this one. Fast match the entrances lasted longer than the match. Funny to listen to the special guest anouncers talk. **
8. Street Fight: Shane McMahon vs. Vince McMahon /Mick Foley= Ref
Awsome street fight. Great father vs. son match With amazing spots and a great story line. Shane flies in this one. *****
9. T.L.C. Tag titles: Dudleys vs. Hardeys vs. Edge & Christian
Just as good as the first if not better. Spike, Lita, Rhyno get involved in this one. Great ladder and tabble action. *****

1394696,4,B000055ZK9,"This one was probably the most intense WrestleMania since 1997 with WrestleMania 13 (though WM 13 is still the most violent in my view). Well, let's get to the matches:
IC Championship:
Chris Jericho (Champion) vs. William Regal - A slow but still interesting match. Decent mat psychology with Regal.
6-man tag team match:
APA and Tazz vs. Right to Censor - Nothing spetacular but was kept short and sweet. Big pop for Bradshaw from the crowd since he's from the state of Texas.
Triple-Threat Hardcore Championship Match:
Raven (Champion) vs. Kane vs. Big Show - Not the best hardcore match but it had its moments, especially when Kane throws Raven through a window!
European Championship Match:
Test (Champion) vs. Eddie Guerrero - Surprisingly good match. Eddie is a great worker but this is one of the better matches for Test.
Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit - The beginning of their classic series of matches that they have had since this one. This was their best bout until the recent Royal Rumble 2003!
Women's Championship Match:
Ivory (Champion) vs. Chyna - Dreadful match that was kept mercifully short! The only real stinker of the card.
Street Fight:
Shane McMahan vs. Vince McMahan with Mick Foley as ref - Very good match! Shane could be the predecessor to Mick Foley in terms of hardcore wrestling! Vince did a good job as well.
TLC II match:
Hardy Boyz vs. Edge and Christian vs. Dudley Boyz (Champions) - More brutal than their previous TLC encounter at SummerSlam 2000. Not as fast paced as that one but definitely more brutal!
Gimmick Battle Royal - Not a great match but it wasn't meant to be. It was for entertainment and it did deliver that.
Triple H vs. Undertaker - Possibly the best Undertaker bout at WM other than his match with Ric Flair the following year at WM 18!
WWF Championship Match;
The Rock (Champion) vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin - Probably the most violent WWF/WWE Championship match ever and my favorite Austin/Rock match!

1394698,5,B000055ZK9,"Overview:
The biggest show of the year of the year for the World Wrestling Federation, Wrestlemania, nearly always delivers when it comes to providing a memorable spectacle.  The 2001 edition of Wrestlemania, number seventeen (or as the WWF likes to spell it X-Seven), was arguably one of the greatest Wrestlemania's, nay wrestling cards of the modern era.
The Card:
Intercontinental Championship: Chris Jericho (C) vs. William Regal
A solid opening match, nothing overly amazing, but that is the purpose of the first match.  8/10
The APA and Tazz vs. The Right To Censor
Nothing wrong with this match, with some great displays of athleticism from the big men in parts.  7/10
Hardcore Championship: Raven (C) vs. Kane vs. The Big Show
The WWF's version of hardcore can be described as `gimmicky', especially when compared with the brand of entertainment that ECW once produced.  However this match did entertain, with some great spots that elicit a chuckle.  7.5/10
European Championship: Eddie Guerrero (C) vs. Test
Good match that shows why Guerrero, should at least, be on his way to great things, like a world title.  Ruined only somewhat, for the wrestling purists, by the constant outside interference.  8/10
Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle
Great match by two excellent in ring performers, this would the first of several great matches between the two.  The ending was a letdown somewhat, but was done in order to further the feud between these two for the next PPV event.  9/10
Women's Championship: Chyna (C) vs. Ivory
This match was kept short and to the point with the expected result.  5/10
Street Fight: Shane McMahon vs. Vince McMahon with Mick Foley as Special Guest Referee
While technically not a great match this one delivered in respect its strong story-telling and several unbelievable spots by Shane McMahon.  The presence of Foley was a bonus as well.  8.5/10
Tag Team Championship - TLC II Match: Dudley Boyz (C) vs. Edge & Christian vs. Hardy Boyz
Absolute spot-fest galore in this one, amazing match, enough said.  10/10
Gimmick Battle Royal
The `classic' faces and gimmicks of yester-year return to remind many of a time of wrestling that many are trying hard to forget. Used well as an `intermission' between TLC II and the two big matches of the night.  (For simplicity the names of the competitors have not being listed).  5/10

Triple H vs. The Undertaker
No titles on the line in this one, a well built up match that amazed with action both in and out of the ring.  9.5/10
WWF Championship: The Rock (C) vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin
The two biggest names of the attitude era go one on one in what would prove to be a great struggle.  The crowd was hot throughout this match and helped add to the emotion.  The quality of the ending though is something that is still debated.  10/10
DVD Extras:
The extras are somewhat disappointing, given that most are simply taken from within the actual Wrestlemania broadcast itself, such as segments on Axxess and the grudge histories that lead up to the respective matches.  The best feature is, arguably, the re-cap of what occurred the next night on Monday night `Raw Is War'.  3.5/10
Overall:
This was the last great show of the attitude era.  After this event, as is well known, the quality of the WWF, later WWE, product began to sour somewhat to what we have today.  Watching this DVD in retrospect helps bring back memories of a time when wrestling was at the forefront of pop-culture.  While a lack of the back-story leading into these matches takes the shine of the event somewhat (this PPV had arguably the greatest build up to an event ever, especially the main event for which anticipation was at absolute fever-pitch), the point is not lost that this was simply a great wresting show.

To start, I must say that this is by far the best WWE/WWF event, best Wrestlemania, and best Sports Entertainment event of all time. When my brother and I first viewed this, we were fairly new to the wrestling world, and by the end we were in shock. In this review, I will express points of each match that we particularly liked, however, I will not give any spoilers as to who won the match except in a couple places.
Matches:
Match 1:
Intercontinental Championship Match
Chris Jericho VS. William Regal
As soon as the great entrance to this Wrestlemania ended,which, in all honesty, was good enough to give us chills; going all through the greatest moments, this was the first match that greated us, and at the time, though it was the first match, it was one of the greatest we had ever seen.  As soon as the match began, it became obvious that the match would be good, but we had no clue how good. It had a good back story to it, and was able to freshen up the rivalry. (8/10)
Match 2:
APA and Tazz VS. Right to Censor with Stephen Richards
Right to Censor is one of the most annoying groups in wrestling and it was good to see them get into a fight with someone who can hold there own. This match was very fun to watch because APA is always great, and Tazz had one of his best matches. There is a reason they call him the Suplex Machine. (7/10)
Match 3:
Hardcore Championship
Kane VS. Raven VS. Big Show
This match was actually quite funny and entertaining, going all around backstage, using some very creative ways to hurt each other. I can't say much about this match because I ran long on the first two, but it was very fun to watch!(9/10)
Match 4:
Test VS. Eddie Gurrero
European Championship
This was probably my least favorite match at Wrestlemania 17, but that's not saying much, it is definitely worth the time to watch. It couldn't really compare to the other matches, but Eddie was fun to watch of course, and had a good story line going in. I did not like all the outside interference and I must say I didn't think it was very fair. (5/10)
Match 5:
Kurt Angle VS. Chris Benoit
Very good technical match, lacking in some places, but still very entertaining...these two have great chemistry and Kurt was funny. (8/10)
Match 6:
Chyna VS. Ivory
Women's Championship
I said I wouldn't give away any matches, and if you don't want to know, don't read on. Chyna completely dominated this match and if I didn't say who won, there wouldn't be much to say. Very short match. (6/10)
Macth 7:
Vince McMahon VS. Shane McMahon Guest Ref: Mick Foley Street Fight
Great match, lots of action, and great story line. Very controversial story...very good match, very entertaining to watch father and son fight it out, GREAT match, one of the best. (10/10)
Match 8:
TLC Match Edge and Christian VS. Hardyz VS. Dudleys
Tag Team Titles
What can you say about TLC? It was GREAT. Very entertaining and some very creative ideas by whoever put together this match. Looked like a car wreck after the match, and the Hardyz dare-devil style added greatly. (10/10)
Match 9:
Gimick Battle Royal
It was great to see some of the oldies back into the ring, announced by Mean Gean Okerland and Bobby the Brain, it was very fun to watch! (8/10)
Match 10:
Undertaker VS. Triple H
Undetaker is by far our favorite wrestler, and again put on a show at Wrestlemania. Most fans will know who won, since 'Taker has never lost at Wrestlemania, and it went out of the ring in this match. Very fun match to watch take place. Hardcore matchup, ref knocked out through most of match (10/10)
Match 11:
The Rock VS. Stone Cold Steve Austin
One of the greatest matches, many two-counts, even after special manuvers. This was a GREAT match, though it had a dissapointing ending after such a hard fought match. The best match at Wretlemania 17, if not of all time, except for the ending. (12/10)
Conclusion:

1394714,5,B000055ZK9,"NOTE: THIS IS THE VHS REVIEW
There is no doubt, Wrestlemania X-Seven is the greatest Granddaddy of Them All.  Just six days after WCW's last television program, and right before the Invasion, the worst (up to that time) and most disappointing storyline ever, this was the WWE at its peak, and in hindsight, was truly the end of the Attitude Era.  What a way for the Attitude Era to end!
Here are the list of matches, with my star ratings (up/down to *****, DUD means zero stars) and some comments on each of them as well...
Pre-Heat: X-Factor (X-Pac and Justin Credible) v. Too Cool (Grandmaster Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty) - Can't rate this match, because I didn't see it, since I saw the VHS version.  I do know that X-Pac should have been put into a better match, though.  (Winner: n/a)
Opener - IC title: Chris Jericho (C) v. William Regal - Decent opener, but Jericho was wasted because he should have been put into one of the main events.  Sure, Regal's a fine technical wrestler, but he's nowhere near Jericho's league.  **1/2 (Winner: Jericho)
Tazz and APA (Faarooq & Bradshaw) v. Right To Censor (Bull Buchanon, Val Venis, and Goodfather) - Unfortunately, the best wrestler in RTC, Steven Richards, didn't wrestle.  Instead, I had to see BB and Goodfather.  I was not impressed.  DUD (Winner: I don't even remember)
Hardcore title: Raven (C) v. Kane v. Big Show - What a disgrace to Raven's abilities!  He deserves better than Kane and Big Slow, who should NOT have been on this show.  Hindsight says that Raven should have gone up against Rhyno, Tajiri, X-Pac, Guerrero, Jerry Lynn, or even Jericho.  Fairly entertaining brawl though, due to of course, Raven. ** (Winner: Kane)
European title: Test (C) v. Eddie Guerrero - Guerrero carried Test to his second-best match ever, only worse than Test/Shane @ Summerslam 1999. Once again, hindsight says that Guerrero should have faced a better opponent, perhaps as European champion against Jericho in a unification match, or defend the title against X-Pac or Raven.  Perhaps it should have been against his fellow Radical, Dean Malenko, who sadly didn't wrestle on this show.  *** (Winner: Eddie Guerrero)
Chris Benoit v. Kurt Angle - What a way to begin one of the greatest feuds of all-time!  This match was awesome until its lame ending, which prevented it from being a Match of the Decade candidate.  A must-see for any true wrestling fan! ****1/4 (Winner: Kurt Angle)
Women's title: Ivory (C) v. Chyna - Ivory deserved better than to be squashed like this.  Sure, this took up only five minutes, but I'll never get those five minutes back.  -*** (Winner: Chyna)
Street Fight - Vince McMahon v. Shane McMahon (Special ref: Mick Foley) - Very entertaining match!  I can't think of a bigger surprise than this match.  All of the outside activities and spots were nice touches.  Surprise of the night! ***1/2 (Winner: Shane McMahon)
Tag titles - TLC II: Dudleyz (C) v. Hardyz v. Edge & Christian - Easy Match of the Decade candidate.  The best match between these three teams, and one of the greatest feuds of all-time at its peak.  Nice outfit by Lita, also.  ***** (Winner: Edge & Christian)
Gimmick Battle Royal - The only good thing about this garbage is that it had Mean Gene Okerlund and Bobby ""the Brain"" Heenan commentating.  I won't bother listing all of the ""wrestlers"" in this drek.  Instead of seeing matches from Malenko, Steven Richards, Hardcore Holly, X-Pac, Jerry Lynn, Rhyno, Saturn, Crash Holly, Steve Blackman, or Rikishi, we got this.  The commentating earns 1/2* for this.  -****1/2 (Winner: Iron Shiek)
Undertaker v. Triple H - An entertaining brawl, but Triple H deserved better than to be fed to a has-been Undertaker, who I'm actually a HUGE fan of.  I wouldn't have minded seeing a Last Man Standing rematch between HHH and Jericho.  Anyways, it was decent, and a nice breather before the main event.  *** (Winner: Undertaker)
Main event - WWE title - No DQ: The Rock (C) v. Stone Cold Steve Austin - The best match these two ever had with each other, and the peak of this top ten all-time feud.  Unfortunately, it had a terrible ending, thus knocking 1/4* off.  I wish they'd had done the Austin-McMahon turn on RAW the night after.  But I appreciate what I did see, and that's one of the greatest brawls of all-time, and a Top Ten Matches of the Decade candidate.  ****3/4 (Winner: Stone Cold Steve Austin)
Well, what a great WrestleMania this was!  Three memorable matches, and only two stinkeroos.  Any show that contains a ****1/4, a *****, and a ****3/4 easily gets an extremely high thumbs up from me!",1059091200,,4591,4.7440100882723835
1394715,5,B000055ZK9,"As a WWE fan for 13 years now, I'd say this pay per view ranks up there with the very best of them. As it progressed, the event just kept getting hotter and hotter ultimately finishing with arguably the most shocking moment in Wrestlemania history. Top to bottom the matches are extremely solid, maybe with the exception of the Women's Title match, but for the fans' sake, it was fortunately a very short dud. Wrestlemania X-7 probably marked the end of the WWE Attitude Era, and in effect, the last successful run the WWE had, and it went out with a bang.
While almost all of the matches are worth watching, some my favorite matches included Angle vs. Benoit, two of the best wrestlers of our time and it was a technical masterpiece. Vince vs. Shane told an emotional dramatic story where Vinnie Mac was well deserving of some kind of an Oscar for his performance here. TLC II was a bumpfest and all of the competitors deserve a standing O for simply putting their bodies on the line. Plus, I loved the Gimmick Battle Royal simply for its sentimental value, it was like watching an 80s-90s reunion. The brawl between Triple H and Undertaker was brutal and intense as I take my hat off to Trips for putting Taker over. And finally, I will never forget Austin vs. Rock for the WWE Title. The ending is absolutely shocking and what lead to it was tense, dramatic and suspenseful competition that only two icons like these two could carry out. In my view, Wrestlemania X-7 is the best Wrestlemania ever and will be hard to top. Well, let's hope Wrestlemania XX next year does just that.",1054857600,2,1583,4.538461538461538
1394716,5,B000055ZK9,"The time before WrestleMania X-Seven was a very prosperous time for WWF/E.  Their three main superstars: Stone Cold Steve Austin, Triple H, and The Rock and even Kurt Angle were in their prime, physically and in popularity.  WWF/E dominated the wrestling business, as it did the past few years since the era of ""Attitude"" was ushered in.  But the company's domination of the American wrestling industry was cemented as ECW had folded in January of that year and WCW, WWF's greatest competitor had been bought out by McMahon.  WrestleMania X-Seven was a triumphant culmination of its splendor and the card reflected that, as this was the most balanced card ever for WrestleMania, or for that matter, a WWF/E pay-per-view.  Top to bottom, this was the finest hour or four hours, to be correct, McMahon and company had.  A rundown of the matches:
1. WWF Intercontinental Championship: Chris Jericho (Champion) vs. William Regal. A solid opener with fairly good ring psychology but with a fairly cold crowd, as well. (3/5)
2. Right To Censor vs. APA & Tazz. Effective warm-up match with a reasonable duration of 5 minutes of a match of this calibre. (3/5)
3. WWF Hardcore Championship: Raven (Champion) vs. Big Show vs. Kane. Nicely paced match with your typical WWF-hardcore spots. (3/5)
4. WWF European Championship: Test (Champion) vs. Eddie Guerrero.  One of the lowest points of the card.  Eddie Guerrero is one of the best lucha technicians in the industry today, but Test, who is more of a Kevin Nash clone hasn't lived up to his potential because he basically doesn't have much potential.  Not exactly a terrible bout, but it wasn't exactly a really good one either. (2.5/5)
5. Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit. Greco-Roman style mat wrestling to start the match off, with entertaining exchanges between the two.  The fight picks the pace up without losing its technical precision.  (5/5)
6. WWF Women's Championship: Ivory (Champion) vs. Chyna. Basically a yawner, but like most women's matches, it's just a span of a few minutes. (2/5)
7. Father/Son Street Fight: Vince McMahon vs. Shane McMahon. Good buildup leading up to this match.  For the most part, it's a match to satisfy storyline marks, especially after Shane's top-rope flying elbow drop through the Spanish announcing table bump.  Shane O'Mac rips off Rob Van Dam, even before he arrived in the WWF, by nailing The Whole F'n Show's patented Van Terminator to finish off Vince. (4/5)
8. Tables, Ladders, Chairs II for the WWF Tag Team Championship: Dudley Boyz (Champions) vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian.  A repeat of their Summerslam 2000 match with a few good twists, involving Spike Dudley, Lita, and Rhyno gaining some run-ins.  Much like its precursor, lots of hardcore spots, with Edge's spear off a 20 foot ladder to a dangling Jeff Hardy onto the canvas, as the highlight bump of this match, in my book.  Personally, I would've wanted to see either the Dudleyz or Hardyz win instead of Edge & Christian, but E & C's victory just cements their place as one of the best tag teams the company had, reminiscent of The Rockers (Shawn Michaels/Marty Janetty). (5/5)
9. Gimmick Battle Royal.  Amusing and nostalgic match which added a humorous, charming touch to this edition of WrestleMania.  There's a lot more pageantry in the entrances, which lasted for a little over ten minutes, compared to the match itself which clocked in about well, by my count, less than two minutes.  Short and sweet, especially if you are a long-time wrestling fan.  (4/5)
10. Triple H vs. Undertaker.  Although the storyline hype wasn't as astronomical as the main event, this match was very well promoted.  Taker is looking to be undefeated in WrestleManias while seeking revenge against the greatest heel of all time, Triple H, in his hometown of Houston, in the biggest spectacle in all of sports entertainment. Yadda yadda yadda... This was Taker's most inspired outing of 2001, with The Game's prime wrestling psychology carrying it.  It had a certain street fight element which was beneficial for Taker's performance.  It hasn't been said a lot but Trips was classy for jobbing to Taker. (5/5)
11. WWF Championship: The Rock (Champion) vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Hands down, the most anticipated championship rematch in the WWF's history.  JR & The King did excellent work behind the mic to make this championship match that much more dramatic.  The match itself wasn't of course, a technical mark's dream match, but nonetheless it was an exciting bloodbath with many near-falls.  Much like the previous year, X7 breaks tradition by having a heel, or in this case a face turned heel, win the championship. (5/5)
In short, WrestleMania X7 arguably goes down as the greatest WrestleMania or to push the ante, the greatest pay-per-view in the company's history.  But on the downside, WWF/E had declined into rougher times after so much articulation and effort into this pay-per-view.  In retrospect, this edition of WrestleMania was wrestling at its peak, with a rather bittersweet feel to it.",1054166400,2,5048,4.967895362663496

Weeks of waiting, trash-talk, stipulations, and interference from the boss, two of the biggest names in the business were going to war.  The Houston Astrodome was electrifying all night long and with a historic father/son rivalry, a TLC match that defined the laws of gravity, Wrestlemania X7 is the ultimate PPV to get if you are a fan of the WWF.

Wrestlemania X7 will go down in history as one of the greatest PPV's of all time.  Every match was a slobbernocker and the fans were into each one.  Many titles changed hands, and there was much brutality in the TLC 2, Undertaker vs. Triple H, and the triple threat hardcore match.

For fans of extreme high flying wrestlers, the Tables, Ladders and Chairs match (""TLC"") between the Dudleys, Hardyz, and Edge and Christian is the best of its kind, and will have you questioning the sanity of all the participants.  Many heartstopping moments and insane falls from high places.
For fans of mat wrestling, Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit put on a four-star clinic.  If you like streetfights, the Vince McMahon/Shane McMahon bout was simply awesome, as Shane executes a move at the end I didn't think he had the balls to try.  This much was much better than most people expected.
Finally, the Main Event between ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin and The Rock is truly something to behold.  I would probably rank it as one of my top five favorite matches of all time.  The crowd was into it, there were many ""false finishes"" and the ending is especially a ""twist"" given the previous three years of WWF storylines.

Oh ya there is still the Chyna/Ivory ""match"" I don't think 1 minute squashes should be in a wrestlemania so that match brought it down a half star by itself and the 6 man tag brought it down another half star so I guess if they kept the right to censor out of 'Mania then it would of been a complete ***** spectatular, but they were so it's not",1048809600,,1283,4.198380566801619

Match 1: Jericho vs. Regal (IC title) - This is by no means a bad match, and it's a very good opener

Match 2:  APA & Tazz against RTC.- Nothing really exciting, but it ended before I got bored

Match 3: Raven vs. Big Show vs. Kane (Hardcore title) - By far the best hardcore match I've seen since 2000
Match 4: Test vs. Eddie Guerrero (European title) - A fairly good exchange between the two, but not much to get you on your feet
Match 5: Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit- Being  a huge Angle fan, I loved this  match. Both competitors showed off their amateur skills for a while, and then they got in to some WWF style fighting. As always, they bring out the best in each other.
Match 6: Ivory vs. Chyna (women's title) - Without a doubt the worst match of the night. I found no redeemable qualities of this match.
Match 7: Shane McMahon vs. Mr. McMahon- This wasn't as much of  a match as it was a brawl, but never the less it was some good action that told the  story well. On a side note, it was wierd how they both used the  same music.
Match 8: Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian vs. Hardy Boyz T.L.C. II) - No question as to whether this is the best match of the night. Nothing shows  desire like crashing through tables from 20 feet up.

Second Disc (DVD version):
Match 9: Gimmick Battle Royal- As a fan since 2000, I hadn't known any of these guys, and it really was funny to think that these guys actually wrestled  at one point. The action is slow at best, and its humor dies fast
Match 10:Triple H vs. Undertaker- Another great match. With the ref out for about half  an hour(WTF) this turned into a street fight.
Match 11:The Rock vs. Austin ( WWF title) - Not a bad match, but it wasn't what I thought it'd be. It is worth it's weight in gold for it's shock value, though. This is truly the WWF at its best.

This is one DVD that never fails to impress.
DVD Extras- There aren't as many as you'd think. Most of what is on as ""extras"" are in fact part of the show. The only real extas are the match from heat , the highlights video, and the next night on raw.",1047686400,,2140,4.100719424460432

3rd- Raven VS Kane VS Big Show (****) I like this match because it was so brutal and you could see Raven at his best. He got crashed through the window by Kane!!
4th- Test VS Eddie Guerrero (**) Average match, I don't know why they put it in the Wrestlemania... it should be on the RAW or SmackDown card.
5th- Kurt Angle VS Chris Benoit (****) I loved this match cause I think Benoit is the best technician. I love every Angle-Benoit match because it's so interesting.

7th- Shane McMahon VS Vince McMahon (****) here's the match I really enjoyed and Shane kicked butt there! Nice low blow there, Linda!
8th- Dudley Boyz VS Hardy Boyz VS Edge & Christian (****) super match! You even got to see Jeff performing Swanton Bomb through 2 tables, Rhyno's gore to Matt Hardy, Spike Dudley's Dudley Dog to Christian, Lita and Spear from top of the ladder!!!!
9th- Gimmick Battle Royal (**) If you like oldies, you'll enjoy this!
10th- Triple H VS Undertaker (****) cool match and 'Taker got smashed to head with sledgehammer during the Last Ride!! Beautiful Chokeslam there, 'Taker!
11th- The Rock VS Stone Cold Steve Austin (*****) The best match on the card!! I would give it more stars, if it wasn't for that crummy ending! Brutal match and Rock & Austin were bleeding more than anybody else in the WWE!! Most brutal match I have ever seen!!

1394744,5,B000055ZK9,"A great extravaganza and easily the best since 'Mania 14. Main event saw austin turn heel and make friends with the devil himself, vince mcmahon. Unfortunately, the crowd loved this. Hardcore match was fantastic (especially raven getting run over by a golf cart by kane!) and TLC 2 was another brilliant match. The undercard was entertaining with matches which i thought would be dull actually proving to be very watchable. Chyna beat Ivory in the most obvious outcome of the nights matches, this was boring. A very good crowd saw shane kick his dads butt in a good father v son match. Overall an excellent ppv and one of the best wrestlemanias ever!",1044576000,,650,4.761061946902655
1394745,4,B000055ZK9,"A VERY fun show to watch, but leaving you with a sour taste in your mouth. Out of 5 stars. . .
IC Championship: Chris Jericho (c) vs. William Regal. 3 stars, good opener, but nothing overly special. Ending was too straight forward.
APA & Tazz vs. RTC. 2 stars, A fun match with no real purpose, except to show off Bradshaw and Jackie to their home-state, to give Tazz a match as he was fairly popular for some reason, and for the RTC to get [...] kicked.
Hardcore Championship: Raven (c) vs. Kane vs. Big Show. 3 stars, very entertaining, but with pretty much the same purpose as the prior match. To show of Kane and Big Show, and for another title to change hands.
European Championship: Test (c) vs. Eddie Guerrero. 2 stars, these wrestlers have 2 things in common. They're not entertaining and I don't care about them. Next.
Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit. 4 and a half stars, probably one of the more technically sound matches EVER, but they just roll around on the mat so much that my attention is often lost.
Women's Championship: Ivory (c) vs. Chyna. 1 star, this match's purpose was to get the belt off of that evil, ugly Ivory, and to show off Chyna. Don't even get me started on why the AMAZINGLY popular Lita was not in this one.
Street Fight: Shane McMahon vs. Vince McMahon. 4 stars, very entertaining, but getting slow in the middle. All of the evil McMahon's get their come-uppance, all of the good get cake.
Tag Title TLC 2: Hardyz vs. Dudleyz (c) vs. Edge & Christian. 5 stars, best match of the night. Interference added alot (Lita was in this one). Great high spots, and never a slow moment.
Gimmick Battle Royal: Everyone over 50. 1 courtesy star, the intros took longer than the match, but this one has sentimental value, but had the wrestling soundness of Ivory vs. Chyna.
Triple H vs. Undertaker. 4 and a half stars, very cool match. Great spots, but after a kick and an elbow, the referee is unconscious for like 15 minutes, hmm. . . still awesome.
WWF Championship: The Rock (c) vs. Stone Cold. 4 and a half stars, pretty much the same match type as Trips vs. Taker, but much more tense at times. However, the Austin twist at the end leaves one with a bitter aftertaste. WrestleMania should end on a positive high note.
However, after the previous year's abysmal WrestleMania 2000, this is a welcome treat. Not a must buy, but definitely a must see.",1040947200,,2371,4.478060046189376
1394776,3,B000055ZK9,"truth is what i tell. and i believe that the main event was a no no. wwf main event was austin vs bret hart all over again. the rock was stealing my boy moves austin. believe me yall look at that match and look at survivor series 96 austin vs bret hart which was a classical match. but tryna make a clone of it wasn't right. but it was a ok match. but i think there match at wrestlemania 15 was way better than that one. but i think outta all wrestlemanias the hype on this one was high ... the best thing about this event was the intro and the music. the best match that night was benoit vs angle. that match was like a whose the best man match. that match is few matches u can see these days cause now dayz fans say the matches r good cause they bleed in the matches now. what happen 2 the good matches. 4 example bret hart vs undertaker at summerslam 97 the best summer event ever. i was mad about the undertaker and triple h match. it wasn't good at all. after wrestlemania 15 they all got weak even though i believe my best one ws 14.

1394777,5,B000055ZK9,"Houston, we have a problem.  WWF Wrestlemania X-Seven invaded the Houston Astrodome on April 1, 2001 to bring to WWF fans the greatest spectacle in sports entertainment.  A double disc set captures all the action both inside the ring and behind the scenes.  From the beginning of Wrestlemania weekend, which included highlights of Axxess and Sunday Night Heat, to the final bell of the final match.  In the main event, the Rock defends the WWF Championship against Stone Cold Steve Austin in a no holds barred classic.  Keep your eyes open for Mr. McMahon.  In another classic confrontation, Triple H goes to war with the Undertaker.  The gimmick battle royal also takes place as WWF superstars of the past battle with eachother one last time in an every man for himself encounter.  The Tag Team Titles hang above the ring as magic once again takes place at Wrestlemania.  Perhaps the greatest Tag Team Title match in WWF history is TLC II.  The Dudley Boyz put their gold on the line against both Edge and Christian, and the Hardy Boyz.  It's father against son in a street fight as Mr. McMahon takes on Shane McMahon.  Chyna challenges Ivory for the WWF Women's Title.  Kurt Angle faces off with Chris Benoit in another classic.  Test defends the European Title against Eddie Guerrero.  Raven is forced to defend the Hardcore Championship in a triple threat match against Kane and the Big Show.  In six man tag team action, the APA and Tazz battle the Right to Censor.  For the Intercontinental Title, Chris Jericho stares down the challenge of WWF Commissioner William Regal.  With almost four full hours of pulse pumping action, no wrestling fan can go wrong with this DVD.  It is no doubt the greatest show in the history of the WWF.

1394781,5,B000055ZK9,"This was THE best Wrestlemania EVER! An easy five stars! And anyone who watches this video and doesn't enjoy it is not a true wrestling fan. WWE will probably never have another wrestling event as good as this one. The only poor matches on the card was the silly Gimmick battle Royal and the Women's Championship match between Ivory & Chyna (Ivory can throw some of the fakest punches ever).  Other than that, this pay-per-view was a true classic! Fans of hardcore wrestling should not be disappointed, as Wrestlemania 17 brings you five hardcore matchups: Kane vs. Raven vs. The Bigshow for the WWE Hardcore title. Also, you'll see the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs II matchup between the Hardy Boys, the Dudley Boyz, and Edge & Christian. This is an extremely breathtaking matchup that you'll have to see to believe, especially the part where Edge literally spears Jeff Hardy off the rungs holding the Tag Team titles!!! Also, witness the first meeting between Triple H and The Undertaker where ""the dead man"" chokeslams HHH off of a 10 ft. tower. This match was very tight, especially at the end where The Undertaker hits HHH with a tremendous ""Last Ride"" powerbomb!  And also, let's not forget about the main event for the WWE Championship: Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. The Rock (no-holds-barred). Austin and The Rock get very physical and end up busting each other wide open! The match continues to get increasingly more violent and bloody until Mr. McMahon (the evil owner of the WWE) interferes in the matchup when it seems that Austin is about to lose. McMahon hands Austin a steel chair and Austin begins beating The Rock with it numerous times and finally pins The Rock to capture his 5th WWE title! After the match, Austin shakes hands with the evil McMahon, selling his soul for the title and turning heel (bad guy). This is probably the most shocking heel turn ever. But despite Austin's heel turn this was the best match ever (in my opinion). This was an excellent pay-per-view that you don't see very often. Chris Benoit took on Kurt Angle in a very interesting matchup. Motorhead sung Triple H's theme song, ""The Game"", LIVE!. The electric guitar sounded quite terrible. Motorhead can make some pretty good music but this just wasn't it. The beat was kind of cool though. Wrestlemania 17 was the best wrestling event EVER!But, hey, why not see it for yourself and make up your own mind.",1031443200,,2399,4.764423076923077
1394782,5,B000055ZK9,"Wrestlemania X-Seven was a great Pay Per View with intense action.  The Pay Per View brought out memorable matches that you won't never forget.  Here are all the matches and how they were.....
#1 WWF Intercontinental Championship: William Regal vs Y2J- A good opener match.  Was decent and not dissapointing.  The ending was a little suprise.
#2 APA & Tazz with Jackie vs Right to censor- A good tag team match, although it was kind of short and there wasn't as much action as you would expect.
#3 WWF Hardcore Championship Triple Threat Match: Big Show vs Kane vs Raven- An AWESOME hordcore match.  This One of my favorite hardcore matches of all time.  It was long and the 3 went all around through the arena.  The match was really revolved around Kane and Big show.  I was suprised Raven lasted al long as he did in the match.  My favorite parts were when Kane tossed Raven through glass and when Kane kicked Big Show off the Ramp.
#4 WWF European Championship: Test vs Eddie Guererro- Not a great match, not a bad match, just an okay match.  It was kind of boring and it was obvious Eddie's friends were gonna come out and help him.
#5 Chris Benoit vs Kurt Angle- A good exciting match.  I couldn't believe that they had so much rivalry considering the fact that there rivalry only started six days before the pay per view.  The match was a little boring because both competitors tried so hard to win by submission and this match led to other matches like their Ultimate 30 minute submission match a BACKLASH and their 2/3 falls match at Judgement Day.
#6 WWF Women's Championship: Ivory vs Chyna- A better women's championship from Royal Rumble.  But I would not know it that well because I was concentrating alot on Chyna's shiny maroon attire.  Believe me, she looked hot (as always)
#7 Street Fight: Shane McMahon vs Vince McMahon with Special Guest Referee Mick Foley- An Incredible match.  Shane-O-Mac had defied the leaps of gravity.  These 2 barely wrestle but put up one greatest matches ever.  The best parts were Trish slapping Vince, Mick Foley getting a little revenge on Vince for having him fired, Shane's flying kick from one apron to another, and Linda getting up and kicking Vince in his grapefruits.  It was a night of a living hell for Vince.  This match was also the start of a rivalry that led the Alliance.
#8 WWF Tag Team Championship TLC II (Tables, Ladders, and Chairs 2)- Edge & Christian vs Hardy Boyz vs Dudley Boyz.  An UNFORGETTABLE MATCH.  It was even better then the one at Summer Slam 2000.  So many tables being brokened, Edge spearing Jeff Hardy when Jeff was hanging from the belts, and interfearences from Spike Dudley, Lita, and Rhyno who also fought each others too!  This is one my top 5 favorite tag team championship matchs!
#9 Gimmick Battle Royal_ Boring but had nostalgic fun.
#10 Triple H vs The Undertaker- A great match between two great wrestlers. The entrances were at the begining of the match was awesome because Triple H had Motorhead play his entrance theme ""The Game"" which was really cool and Undertaker came down with his new bike.  The match had pretty much what evry wrestling fan wants to see.  Brutality, blood, weapons being used like the sledgehammer and a sweet ending when Undertaker picked up HHH while he was puching him so he could give him the last ride!  Undertaker improved his wrestlemania record 9-O!
#11  WWF Championship: The Rock vs Stone Cold Steve Austin.  A great ending to a Pay Per View.  Limp Bizkit's song ""My Way"" was a great theme to this pay per view and their rivalry.  So many times had it looked like this match was going to be over but it just kept continuing.  Rock and Austin put up a good fight.  The only down part of this match was the ending which was Austin 3:16's winning the because of his change of character by having an alliance with Vince McMahon! his long time arch enemy.  This was start of the hatred the fans had against Steve Austin that lasted a long time.
Over all I think Wrestlemania X-Seven was one best Pay Per Views of all time and may even be the best Pay Per View of 2001.  Any wrestling fan will love this so buy it.",1029888000,,4139,4.533692722371968

IC Belt: Chris Jericho(c) vs. William Regal- ***2/3
Great opener.  Crowd was right into it.  Funny buildup and an entertaining match with diverse styles.  Ending sneaks up on you.
6-Man Tag: Tazz and APA vs. Right to Censor- ***
Fairly watchable.  Pretty short, so it doesn't overstay its welcome.  Faarooq sees little action, though.
Hardcore Title Match: Raven(c) vs. Kane vs. Big Show- ****2/3
Awesome title match.  Not a dull moment in this one.  Insane spots and great ending.  Raven, with guts and toughness, starts to really get over with the fans.
Euro Title Match: Test(c) vs. Eddie Guerrero- ***1/3
Another good match between diverse styles. Test and Guerrero shine and make each other look good.  One of the better Euro title matches.
Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle- ****1/3
Great technical match.  Shows there is something for everyone here.  Start of a classic rivalry that only gets better.  The ending is the only downfall, but it is good for furthering the rivalry.
Women's Title Match: Chyna vs. Ivory(c)- **2/3
Worst match on the card, and it's not all THAT bad.  It is 12,443 times better than their Royal Rumble match.
Street Fight: Vince McMahon vs. Shane McMahon- *****
Unforgettable.  The McMahons aren't experienced wrestlers, but they can really put on some exciting matches.  Shane is insane in the membrane with 2 amazing spots.  Plus, the crowd went wild when Linda rose.  Also, Mick Foley.  Nuff said.
TLC Tag Title Match: Edge & Christian vs. Dudleyz(c) vs. Hardyz-*****
Match of the Year.  This could be in a PPV with nothing but Kennel from Hell matches and Teddy Long-Howard Finkel Hair vs. Hair matches and I would still buy the tape.  That is how awesome it is.
Gimmick Battle Royal- *****
It gets 5 stars for the entrances alone.  The match itself isn't great, but it is total nostalgic fun.
Triple H vs. Undertaker- *****
Not a dull moment in this one.  Motorhead rocked, and the Undertaker is the hometown boy, so the entrances alone got the crowd into it.  Plenty of outside and scaffold action, some religious poo-poo chants, blood, sledgehammers, and an exciting finish make this one a 5 star classic.
Heavyweight Title Match: Stone Cold vs. The Rock(c)- *****

Nobody saw this coming and that is what made this pay-per-view stand out in the archives of the WWE. The match itself was the better of all the matches between Austin and the Rock. If you enjoyed the championship match between the two from Wrestlemania XV, you will truly enjoy this. It was all culminated by a vicious attack from Austin with a steel chair that finally put the Rock away. This is also the first of two straight Wrestlemania's (Wrestlemania X8 being the other) that the fans were more behind the Rocks opponent than the Rock himself. But, can you blame him? Wrestlemania was in Texas..we all know where Austin's from :-p
TLC II, the Gimmick Battle Royal, Angle vs. Benoit, and Undertaker vs. HHH were the other matches that headlined this pay-per-view.

Ok, that was pretty cool, but, the match alone didn't steal the show from the other matches I have listed. The moment that is in my mind forever though is during the triple threat Hardcore title match: Kane driving a golf cart and running down Raven..gotta see this, very comical.

1. Intercontinental title match
Y2J (champion) vs William Regal 4/5 stars. This was a great opener for wrestlemania 17. Nice moves.
2. 6 man tag
APA and Tazz vs Right to Censor 2/5 stars
This was an ok match. It was just too short.
3. Hardcore title match
Raven (champion) vs Bigshow vs kane 5/5 stars Awesome hardcore title match. Best one i've seen in years.
4. European title match
Test (champion) vs Eddie Guerrero 2/5 stars It wasn't as short as the 6 man tag. Just an average match.
5. Kurt Angle vs Chris Benoit 5/5 stars This was probably the best technical match of all time
6. Women's title match
Ivory (champion) vs Chyna 0/5 stars Short and boring. In the beginning, Ivory had the offense. But Chyna dominated the rest of the match.
7. Street Fight
Shane vs Vince
Special Referee:Mick Foley  5/5 stars This was my personal favorite match on the card. Amazing bumps. There were so many things that happened in that match.  I've never been so into a match like I was in this one.
8. TLC 2 match for the tag titles
Dudleyz (champions)vs Edge and Christian vs the Hardys
5/5 stars All I can say to this match is... Unbelieveable
9. Gimmick battle royal
0/5 stars The match wasn't good at all. It's like your watching these 20 guys that are like 50 years old go at it. But I just grade this on how well the match is. Not the entrances. Those were pretty fun to watch.
10. Triple h vs the Undertaker
4/5 stars I didn't expect that much from this match. But it turned out to be great. The referee was down for most of the match. Then it got really hardcore.
11. WWF Title match
the Rock (champion)vs Stone Cold Steve Austin

RAVEN V. Big Show V. Kane 10/10: This is where things go nuts! I wanna say the events but will spoil. This match very rewatchable! Best Hardcore title match ever tied with Jeff Hardy V. RVD.
Eddie Guerrero V. Test 6/10 : Funny moments in this match but are cut out on the DVD and VHS, like no one can take test's leg out of the rope, Eddie,Ref an only Perry can do it and when Eddie slips on the apron and falls flat on his face. Good match with nice ending.
chyna V. Ivory 1/10 : ... Obvious who wins.
Angle V. Benoit 9/10 : Intense , hard fought match. Great ending. suspenseful (is that a word?) anyways great!
Vince V. Shane 10/10 : Entertainment value is great. Steph,Trish , Linda , Mick . Great match great table spot and great ending.

Gimmick Battle royal 0/10 (6/10 for me): I put 6 for me because it brings back so many memories but any casual wrestling fan will say it was the worst match of WMX7. Entertaining for old wrestling fans.

Intercontinental Title match. Chris Jericho VS William Regal
This match was a good curtain raiser with some nice moves. Regal puts on an unsually good performance. 3/5
European Title:
Test VS Eddie Guerrero.
A good match while it lasted, it was ruined though by the Radicalz interference. 2/5
Hardcore Title:
Raven VS Kane VS Big Show.
This was an arena wide brawl. A better match then i expected. Watch for Raven when he gets chucked through a glass window. 3/5
Tazz and A.P.A VS Right 2 Censor.
A quick and exciting match. It could have gone longer. This is one of the last RTC matches which is good as they were really annoying. Also, Tazz doesn't wrestle another match after this until the KOTR tourament. 3/5
Chris Benoit VS Kurt Angle.
A wrestling purists dream. This is the best mat wrestling i have seen in the WWF for a long while. 5/5
Womens Title:
Chyna VS Ivory
A pointless squash match. I really think Ivory got about 2 moves in. She does redeem herself as she takes some great bumps. 3/5
Tables, Ladders, and Chairs 2 for the WWF Tag Team Titles:
Hardy Boyz VS Edge and Christian VS Dudley Boyz.
A great performance by all guys involved. Interference by Spike, Rhyno and Lita only add to the excitement. Some unbelieveable high spots for example, Jeffs Swanton Bomb off a 20 foot ladder and Edges spear off the huge ladder to a dangling and prone Jeff Hardy. 5/5
Street Fight:
Shane McMahon VS Vince McMahon.
This is a usual Shane'O match with a couple of sick bumps. With Mick Foley as special referee it only makes the match better. Watch out for Shane's Van Terminator attempt.(not as good as van dam himself, but a fair effort.)
Gimmick Battle Royal.
An entertaining contest with some of the greatest gimmicks in the history of wrestling. I still believe they should have put Paul Heyman in the mix as Paul. E.Dangerously. 3/5
Undertaker VS Triple H.
A huge brawl all over the Astrodome with some great high spots.
Undertaker gets a huge reaction in front of his home crowd. 4/5
WWF Title:
Stone Cold Steve Austin VS The Rock.
A good match, not too much wrestling but fairly entertaining. The good thing is it doesn't drag on. It is also the start of a new era in the WWF.4/5
I recommend this video to any WWF fan as it is a good PPV and showcases what the WWF is all about.",1016928000,,2414,4.4391891891891895
1394802,5,B000055ZK9,"Wrestlemania is the event of the year. It surpasses the World Series, the Grammy Awards, and even the Super Bowl. For 17 years Wrestlemania has been coming to us and for 17 years hasn't let us down. Wrestlemania X-7 can be considered the King of Wrestlemanias. Many consider it to be the greatest Wrestlemania ever, and even the greatest event in WWF history. The matches were incredible. I have not seen the video yet, but I was 5 rows from ringside, and from what I witnessed, it was the greatest thing I have ever seen. When you see the insane moves pulled off in the TLC II match you will gasp. Everyone around me were breathless after the high flying Hardyz crash through half a dozen tables.
Another highlight of the night was the Gimmick Battle Royal match. All your favorite gimmicks were back for one night only. Names such as Iron Sheik, Sargent Slaughter, Gobbedly Gooker, Repoman, The Goon, Bushwackers, Michael Hayes, and others were all brawling it out in a single ring.
The Hardcore match was incredible. Big Show, Raven, and Kane crashed through walls, doors, and even tried to run each other over with a golf cart. Deffinately one of the best Hardcore Matches ever.
The main event set up the storyline for the entire year. Stone Cold made history in this match and shocked the world, twice.

1394823,5,B000055ZK9,"WrestleMania X7 was the most anticipated WWF event of all time and, I must say, it was the greatest WrestleMania event of all-time, surpassing WrestleMania III which, until this card, was my favourite event ever. If you are a fan of pure wrestling action you probably won't enjoy this card (excepting the Angle-Benoit match) but, if you are like me you can look past the pure and technical wrestling aspect and just enjoy the show for its emotionally charged, action-packed matches. My favourite match was the McMahon Street-Fight which was not a good match from a technical standpoint but this match told an amazing story. This match will mean much more if you had seen all the lead up action but you will enjoy it anyway. I must say, this is a brilliant card which earns each and every one of its five stars.",1013126400,,810,4.631944444444445

1394825,5,B000055ZK9,"Wrestlemania x7 had everything you ever wanted. Great Matches,Title Changes,Hardcore action,high flying spectaculars,TLC,turns and much more. The matches are all rated here:
1. IC Title Match:Chris Jericho beat William Regal  6/10
This match was pretty short and the action got slow at some points. Jericho retained the title in the end with a lionsault.
2. A.P.A.&Tazz beat RTC  5/10
Not enough action by Faarooq and Tazz. Goodfather actually did pretty good in the match but got boring just because it was the RTC.Richards got beat up by Jaqueline also.
3. Hardcore Title Match:Kane beat Bigshow and Raven  8/10
This match was very,very, hardcore. Kane threw Raven through a window after choking him with a hose. Bigshow and Kane sent each other through a wall. Raven got in a golf cart and rode off but Kane chased him with his own cart and the ref caught a ride on the back. In the end Kane kicked Bigshow and Raven off the stage and legdropped Bigshow to win the title. Raven didn't stand a chance.
4. European Title Match:Eddie Guerrero beat Test  4/10
This match could have been alot better if Test did more high flying stuff and less power moves. He also dominated the match too much. Eddie hit Test with the belt to win with his Radical pal distracting the ref.
5. T.L.C. II Match:Edge & Christian beat the Dudleyz and Hardyz again 7/10
E&C won once again. Come up with a new ending to these TLC matches.some new stuff with the ladders and tables but not to many. E&C win there 7th tag team titles.
6. Womens Title Match:Chyna beat Ivory to win the title  3/10
This only lasted 4 min. Chyna just gave her a gorilla press and laid across Ivory to win. Shouldn't Chyna still be fighting for the IC title instead of the womens.
7. Gimmick Battle Royal:Iron Sheik Wins 4/10
A bunch of old faces have come back. It took Sheik about 20 minutes just to get to the ring. The dumb Gobbley Gooker was in the match as well. After Sheik won Sgt. Slaughter came back and gave him the cobra clutch.
8. Kurt Angle beat Chris Benoit  6/10
This was kinda boring at some points thanks to some amatuer wrestling. The tried alot of submissions as well. When the ref wasn't looking Benoit made Angle tap but Angle won by grabbing the tights.
9. Street Fight:Shane beat Vince  8/10
This was an exciting match:Mick Foley was ref. Trish turned on Vince and got in another fight with SMH. Linda walked out of her wheelchair and Shane gave Vince the Van Terminator into a trash can to win.
10. Undertaker beat Triple H  8/10
An exciting match with the most story. HHH got chokeslammed off a platform in a street fight while the ref was down. Taker tried to give him the last ride but HHH hit him in the head with the sledgehammer. He then gave him an extra big Last Ride to win.
11. WWF Title Match:Steve Austin beat the Rock  9/10
Who would've thought. Vince came down in the match and helped Austin win. After the win SCSA and Vince shook hands while the Rock looked in disbelief on the ground bleeding.",1008720000,2,2988,4.508317929759705

Eddie Guerrero beat Test to win the European Title and Kane won a GREAT hardcore triple threat to win the title. Shane-vs-Vince was very emotional with a humongous story. TLC II was eXtreme,even though the Hardyz lost. Undertaker continued his Wrestlemania undefeated streak with a big win over Triple H. Steve Austin and Rock put on a memorable performance that will be remembered forever thanks to Vince McMahon.",1005091200,,554,5.032608695652174
1394829,5,B000055ZK9,"One of the best WWF PPVs I have ever seen!  From top to bottom, this was a 4 hour thrill definately worth the money you payed for!
WMX-7 started with Chris Jericho vs. William Regal which was pretty good but the crowd was dead and made you wonder if there were 68 thousand or 68 hundered fans in the building.  Chris wins with the Lionsault to retain the IC title.
Tazz & APA vs. Right to Censor was mediocre, however the promo Bradshaw does before the match is hilarious.
Kane vs. Raven vs. Big Show turned out to be pretty good.  High point was when Kane dropped Big Show and Raven through the stage and leg dropped them to win the Hardcore title!
Eddie Guererro vs. Test was pretty good.  You should have a good laugh though, when Test gets his foot stuck between the ropes (which was not part of the match, however, Eddy, Saturn, and Heyman do a good job of making it seem part of the show).
Chyna vs. Ivory was great...at sucking!  Hit the fast forward button on this one. (Ironically enough, they would have a much better match on Smackdown a couple days later)
Shane McMahon vs. Vince McMahon was either five-star or a fart depending on how you look at it.  It had little wrestling to it, however, there were some wicked bumps and it did an excellent job of telling the story.  The fans really woke up when Linda rose from the wheel chair.  They sounded like 68 million instead of 68 thousand when that happened.
TLC II (E&C vs. Hardys vs. Dudleys) was a definite show stealer.  Although not as good as TLC 1 at Summerslam 2000, the interference of Lita, Spike, and Rhyno made the difference in not being a twin of the first TLC.
Gimmick Battle Royal was meant for comedy.  For those who watched the WWF in the early to mid 90's, it was a reminder of how bad wrestling used to be.  For those who started watching during or after the Attitude era, it gave them a glimpse of what wrestling used to be like.  (Bushwackers, Repo Man, Gobbeldy Gooker are examples of the participants)
Undertaker vs. HHH was excellent.  For once, a battle into the crowd wasn't just hitting guys with trash cans and rolling through a sea of people.  Do not be fooled when UT chokeslams HHH off the sound towers though, he doesn't land on concrete, it is some padding.
Austin vs. Rock was better than its WM15 cousin.  These two not only provided a great match for both hardcore and mainstream fans, they relived past a couple past WM moments besides the WM13 overrated bloodbath.  (Rock countering the Million Dollar Dream the same way Bret Hart countered Piper's sleeper in WM8 is an example)
BTW: X-Pac does not suck! (in Bizzarro world that is!)",1004400000,,2633,4.454166666666667
1394830,5,B000055ZK9,"WrestleMania X-Seven has to be one of the greatest WrestleManias ever. the card was terrific. The matches that really stand out in this event would be the McMahon Street Fight (Shane's athletic ability is incredible), TLC II (terrific match from the start), Undertaker v.s. HHH (the story with this one is cool and the match itself is great. both men fight all over the arena while the ref's down and out. also, the Undertaker finally TOMBSTONES his opponent!!!!), and of course, The Rock v.s. Stone Cold in the main event. Despit the very dissapointing ending to it, this match was very great. the rest of the card was excellent too, but those are the matches that really stand out. this is a must-have for any wrestling fan.",1002585600,,726,4.724409448818897

The people are screaming their throats out, and you can feel the greatness of the WWF. All matches are great, but my favorites are Benoit vrs. Angle, the TLC2, HHH vrs. Undertaker, Reagal vrs. Jericho (to short though), and the main event, this one is just breathtaking, the Rock and Austing gave everything in this one, surprising ending, exellent PPV.

But the real action is at streetbrawls.com Never, in my long wrestling-watching life, would I thought I would ever see WCW/ECW vs the WWF. The RVD (Rob Van Dam) vs. Jeff Hardy match is a classic if you ask me. The bra and panties tag match too! >=) Two of many reasons to own this one of a kind.",1001376000,,440,4.25
1394873,5,B000055ZK9,"Wrestlemania.  The greatest sports entertainment event.  The only ppv that's three months in the making.  The 2001 version (WM 17) could possibly be the greatest ppv ever.  It's the best of my collection for sure.  Never have I seen intensity and athletic ability in wrestling then here.
The DVD format of course have some extras you should know about.  It's a 2-disc format that split up in a weird way.  The event is more or less cut in half between the DVDs.  The first eight matches are on DVD 1, the last 3 DVD 2.  A far cry from last years Wrestlemania 2-disc.  But who cares?  Here are the extras:
Play It Now: Plays the first 8 matches (DVD 1) or last 3 (DVD 2)as seen live on ppv.
Pick A Fight: Pick a match of your own choosing
Flashbacks: How two wrestlers came to WM
Extra Stuff:
DVD 1: A Benoit interviw, extra match (Grandmaster Sexay & Blackman vs. X-Factor), and video clips of the WWF visiting Ft. Hood and WWF Axxess.
DVD 2: Bushwacker Interview, a WWF New York Clip, the Triple H/Undertaker incident, The Highlight video (usually shows a recap of ppv) and what happened the next night on RAW
The first two features are standard.  The flashbacks and extra stuff are pretty cool.  Unfortunately, the next night on RAW just shows the night in short, edited clips.  I would like to see the whole main event of RAW, just like on TV.  But enough about the features.  You want the matches:
1)Jericho vs. Regal: Intercontinental champ match.  These two are good wrestlers but I personally think they lack chemistry, at least in the ring.  They tried though and made an okay match.  3.5 stars out of 5.
2) APA & Tazz vs. RTC:  An okay match that I think was the best you get from the six.  Not to say the six men are not good.  Just not in a six-man, brawl-style match.  Didn't have a nice flow they usually have in singles (Tazz, Venis) or Tag (APA or Buchanan/Goodfather).  3 stars.
3) Raven vs. Big Show vs. Kane: Hardcore champ match.  This was pretty hardcore.  I rather enjoy the Raven strategy: hit hard, run hard.  Showed he's pretty smart.  Good pshychology of showing Kane's and Big Show's ability to hurt somebody.  Check this match out if you wanna see an interfere-free, first fall wins hardcore match.  4 stars.
4) Test vs. Guerrero: European Champ match.  A quailty matched that was well-paced, nice thought out and gave us a pretty cool new move (Tilt-the-whirl to powerbomb. Trust me. It's cool).  The match did something Regal and Jericho didn't: show two different wrestlign styles clashing together.  Test with his power and strength against Guerrero's speed and technical superiority.  4.5 stars.
5) Angle vs. Benoit:  Ever hear the phrase 'For every hold, there's a counter-hold'.  Add 'For every counterhold, there's another counter-hold', and you can explain this match.  I didn't think you could reverse the anklelock or the crossface, but you can as shown in this match.  The technical ability of these two really show off here.  Too bad it was slow to start and had a bad ending.  4.5 stars.
6) Ivory vs. Chyna: Women's Champ match.  Short and to the point.  This match served only to give Chyna revenge and to show her superiority.  Nothing more.  I have nothign against women's wrestling in WWF but please actually wrestle.  I don't like seeing one-sided matches, though annoying Ivory getting pounding is entertaining.  3 stars.
7) Shane vs. Vince: Street Fight w/ Mick Foley as Special Ref.  Two non-trained athletes fighting it out = boring right?  WRONG!  The intesity, excitement and athletic ability (mostly Shane) of these two made this match just as good as the main event.  I couldn't believe Shane doing two crazy bumps or Vince's willingness to take one of those bumps.  5 stars.
8) Dudleys vs. Hardyz vs. Edge & Christian: TLC 2!  Tables were broke, ladders were climbed, and chair were dented with head prints.  Does it get better?  Yes.  Yes indeed.  This mtach was better then the first TLC match because this had different better spots that were well chereographed and timed well.  Also, it never looked like they were setting up a spot.  Very cool match.  5 stars.
Side note: The PPV is split here to disc 2
9) Gimmick Battle Royal: Go over the top to be eliminated.  Do you want the whole list of wrestlers?  Well, okay:  Nikolai Volkoff (The Russian wrestler), Kamala (He rubs stuff on his belly), Kimchee (Kamala's trainer), Iron Sheik (Hated villian in old school WWF), Sgt. Slaughter (Loved wrestlers in his time), Repo Man (Funny gimmick), Earthquake (Big fat guy who sat on you), Gobbledy Gooker (I can't explain), The Goon (Hockey goon), Tugboat (See 'Eathquake'), One Man Gang (Big fat guy who didn't sit on you), Hillbilly Jim (Don't go messing with a country boy), Brother Love ('Taker first manager), Doink (He's a clown), Duke Droese (He's a garbage man), Micheal Hayes (A freebird?), Jim Cornette (The best darn manager ever. . .next to The Brain), The Bushwhackers (You're  very deprived if you haven't seen these two).  Fun for what it was.  4 stars.
10) Triple H vs. Undertaker:  A great match that was overshadowed by the other 5 star matches.  I bet you next year, not many people will remember this match.  It's too bad.  This was excellent.  Watch 'Taker chokeslam Triple H 'straight to hell'.  It's so cool!  5 stars.
11) The Rock vs. Steve Austin: WWF Champ match.  Never before has a match been so personal, so intense, and so wonderfully down that it makes you cheer, boos, and makes you angry at the end of it all.  Most of all, it entertains like entertains like no other.  This is a match for all ages.  It was brutal yet technical, chaotic yet orderly.  The pace was perfect and the crowd just made it even better.  Watch teh build-up to it and you get even more into it.  The storyline wa perfect shown during the match.  Stone Cold constantly showed he would do anything to win the belt.  The Rock showed he wouldn't give the belt up without a fight.  The end will shock you, anger you, and then entertain you.  You almost believe that this wrestlign storyline is real!!!  5 stars b/c that's how far my rankings go.
Great main event.  Great mid-cards.  So many 5 stars in one ppv and I rarely give up 5 stars.  A must have for any wrestling fan.",999907200,8,6232,4.617915904936015
1394874,5,B000055ZK9,"The matches were incredible!, I especially liked TLCII it was great. Jericho vs. Reagal was pretty good.the 6-man tag team matchup(APA & Tazz vs. RTC) was excitiung when Bradshaw delivered the ""Clothesline From Hell"" on the Goodfather. The Triple-Threat Mathup(Raven vs. Kane vs. Big Show) was very,very good. GREAT ACTION!.The Europepean Championship(Test vs. Latino Heat) was  kinda good. Chyna vs. Ivory was an exeptional match, but Chyna tore Ivory apart!!.The Father vs. Son matchup was very fun and had soap opera drama. Kurt and Benoit put up a great matup by starting out by trying to tip eachother out but then it turned into a brawl. The MOST EXCITING MATCH was defidently TLC11 with great TABLE>LADDER>CHAIR action. HHH vs. Decade Of Destruction was a great all around match-up. The Gimmick Battle Royal was pretyy funny, but ok. The WWF Championship match Rock vs. 3:16 was ""A GREAT MATCH-UP"" with great intesity, except i was dissapoiunted with the endind because MR.

1394875,5,B000055ZK9,"Wrestlemania 17 is easily the best Wrestlemania ever. The only negative thing I can say about it is that Jericho/Regal is too short. Rock VS Austin was an awesome 30 minutes plus match that did a great job at turning Austin into the amazing heel we see every monday and thursday. Angle VS Benoit was a technical masterpiece, like you'd expect. HHH VS Undertaker was much better than expected and was probably a ***.5 match. Shane VS Vince was also way better than it had any right to be. Lots of drama plus Shane uncorked his ""Van-Terminator"" (Or is it Van-Shaneinator?) TLC II was a fun spotfest that included many innovative ladder spots. The Hardys, E+C, and Dudleys almost killed eachother but had a great match in the process. No other wrestlemania is this good. Although the DVD features are nothing exciting, the real draw is the card itself. If you like good wrestling, it goes no better than Wrestlemania 17.",998870400,,917,4.701863354037267

1394877,4,B000055ZK9,"This was one of the only wrestling events that I watched that actually had me cheering on my feet. I lost my voice at the event! Arguably one of the best Wrestlemanias, this event marks the turning point for the industry, as it was the first pay-per-view that featured the newly purchased WCW, once considered the WWF's rivals. It also brought back many workers who had left the federation, which was unparralleled as the WWF used to wipe all memory of a worker away once the quit or were fired. For old-school fans, this was definately a treat. The main event also began one of the most heated, conterversial and interesting agnles ever - the heel turn of one of the most famous wrestlers ever, Stone Cold Steve Austin. If I had a complaint, I'd say the DVD was a little skimpy on the extras. What they call extras are actually segments FROM the event itself, which is a blatant misadvertisement.

1394878,5,B000055ZK9,"Yeah, okay, so the Iron Sheik only had a small part, as he took place in the ""Gimmick"" Battle Royal, but this is just one of the eleven matches that made up one of the best Wrestlemanias of all time.
This DVD is packed with lots of wrestling action, and the sound is absolutely superb.  The best match of the night had to be Triple H vs. Undertaker.  These two took the fighting to a new level and they fought all over the arena.  The ending of that match was unbelievable.  The McMahon vs. McMahon match with Mick Foley as the referee was also awesome.  Not only did Linda McMahon get up out of the wheelchair to slap Vince, but Shane-O-Mac literaly flew from one end of the ring to the other to slam a garbage can into his father's face.  Other hilights include the Triple Threat match for the Hardcore Championship between Raven, Big Show, and Kane.  It was amazing when Kane ran over Raven's leg with a golf cart.  Yes, I am still talking about wrestling!
The main event featured the Rock against ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, in what had to be the most unexpected turn of the year.  This great match lasted quite a while, as both men gave their all, ending the spectacular card nicely.
This was a great Wrestlemania, and an even better DVD.  This is a must for any fan of the WWF, and that's the bottom line!",997488000,,1310,4.331967213114754

1394882,5,B000055ZK9,"Sure, the Jericho/Regal match was sloppy, the APA/Tazz/RTC match was pointless, the Chyna""Ivory match was barely that, and the Test/Guerrero match was just plain bad, but the rest of this PPV was unforgettable. The Hardcore Triple threat match had some great bumps-- some of the best I've seen in an actual match. The Angle/Benoit was a great example of technical wrestling at it's finest. The Taker/HHH match was AWESOME.  The two battle up the camera tower and one goes done the hard way.  ...  In a very sweet moment, Taker points to the Sara tattoo on his neck and covers his heart. Austin/Rock was a great slugfest with a great ending. The McMahon street fight had Shane taking Foley-esque risks and was really impressive considering the competitors. The Gimmick Battle Royal was a great match for old-time fans.  I couldn't help but do the Bushwhacker dance when they came down the aisle. But by far the best match was TLC II.  The nine people involved but their bodies on the line and put on a show that rivals Hell in the Cell or Andre/Hogan in its sheer awesomeness.",995587200,,1075,4.696808510638298
1394903,5,B000055ZK9,"Okay, I guess I'll just rate the matches one by one, to prove this is in fact in the top five WrestleManias of all time:
Jericho vs Regal: hot opener.  two very good workers who will one day be among the wwf's best.  this is a preview of the future of the wwf.
APA and Tazz vs RTC: this match is a ""sleeper"".  not exactly a technical masterpiece, but Bradshaw's speech was inspired, and I just totally marked out when he hit that clothesline from hell.
Kane vs Big Show vs Raven: hilarious hilarious hardcore match.  Raven's efforts were great and it's just so funny watching Big Show's eyes pop out of his head as well as Kane driving a golf cart.
Test vs Eddie Guerrero: some old-school style wrestling with the old-school ""face should have won if not for interference"" storytelling.  Very solid match from two very hard workers.
Kurt Angle vs Chris Benoit: if you like technical wrestling, this is for you.  if you don't keep away from this match.  me?  i like it.
Chyna vs Ivory: this match was just put on this card in a pathetic attempt to build up the women's division by having the face beat the dominant heel champion at wrestlemania.
Vince vs Shane: their matches aren't always technically sound, but Shane McMahon is guaranteed to incite Holys ... with every match he has.
TLC 2: my only gripe with this match is that it didn't have a pre-match video package buildup.  the wwf does great video editing and this feud has been going on for two years.  with the inclusion of new players (rhyno, spike, and lita), a video package would have informed the newer, more casual fans of the seriousness of the feud.
Gimmick Battle Royal: for the wresling historians, this match is great, making you think ""why the hell did we watch this when we were younger???""  and for the newer fans, this match gives them incentive to go out and buy old wwf videos!  or not,whatever.
Triple H vs Undertaker: in a battle between the wwf's locker room leaders, Triple H and the Undertaker proved why this WrestleMania should have been billed with a ""double main event"".
Stone Cold vs The Rock:  great great story to this match.  Stone Cold and the Rock aren't the best technical wrestlers there are, and i'm not a big fan of brawling unless roddy piper and brian pillman are involved, but they tell a great story that any real wrestling fan must watch.",995500800,,2338,4.535714285714286
1394904,5,B000055ZK9,"This truly was the greatest WM of all time with the best heel turn ever.
Match 1: Jericho VS Regal, IC TItle: OK but regal really cannot take his bumps.
Match 2: APA & Taz VS RTC: Taz did well considering he had a concussion the majority of the match. All competitors deserved their spot on WM card.
Match 3: Should have been a straight Raven VS Kane match as Big Show doesn't deserve to be on Metal. He truly sucks at everything he does. Good ending.(hardcore title).
Match 4: Test VS Eddie Guerrero, European title: Good match featuring quality offence but a lame ending. He could have used the frog splash!!!!
Match 5: Angle VS Benoit: Oh my God some wrestling!! People probably marked this match down for its slow start but it built into a great fued.
Match 6: Chyna VS Ivory, womens title: I truly hate Chyna.
Match 7: Vince VS Shane: Great match which told an even better story and a superb climax with Shane O'Mac stealing RVD's Van Terminator but who cares it is an outstanding move. Very glad to see that Mick Foley can still take the best chair shot in wrestling even though he is retired.
Match 8: TLC, Dudleyz/Hardyz/Edge+Christian: Honourable mention goes to Rhyno,Spike and Lita who made their presence felt. I personally think this was their best TLC match yet because of the craziness of having 9 people running around breaking tables,ladders and smashing chairs instead of 6. Breathtaking.
Match 9: Gimmick battle Royal:I know Slaughter got a huge pop but everyone wanted to see Doink win and there is even boos when he is eliminated.
Match 10: Taker VS Triple H:It would have been mint if Bizkit played Taker in aswell as Motorhead 4 Triple H. Solid brawl with a innovative ending. Always nice to see a bit of blood aswell.
Match 11: Rock VS Stone Cold, WWF Title: Possibly the greatest WM main event of all time as both men gave everything they had. Vince McMahon makes a special guest appearance at the end to put Stone Cold over as one of the best heels in my opinion that I can remember. With both men bloodied the evil McMahon screws The Rock to let him go off and become a movie star.
Yes it was the best WM of all time,buy it now.",995328000,,2155,4.472081218274112
1394905,5,B000055ZK9,"In 1985, Vincent K. McMahon... the co-founder of the World Wrestling Federation, created the very first of a series of wrestling shows that would ultimately be known as ""WrestleMania""
The 17th WrestleMania which eminated from the Reliant Astrodome in Houston, Texas on April 1, 2001, was nothing short of spectacular. With 65,925 fans in attendance, this $3.5 million grossing event was not only the WWF's most successful PPV ever, but the highest grossing one as well.
Every match on the card featured top sports-entertainment talent at their very best. Every single WWF superstar worked their butts off to pull off this extraordinary, one-of-a-kind show. (For match listings... just scroll down... you'll find them somewhere)
The DVD edition makes this an even better buy... digitally remastered sound and picture enchances the viewing experience a great deal.
However, be forewarned... do not buy this for the DVD extras unless you want to see Sunday Night Heat footage prior to the PPV itself.",995155200,3,997,5.2375
1394906,5,B000055ZK9,"This is, in my opinion THE BEST WWF pay-per view. I have every one since January 1998. My only grudge against it is that it is poorley laid out! 8 matches on the 1st and 3 on the 2nd disk with a few extras on each. Now if you think that that is because they couldn't fit all the matches on one DVD with all the extras on the other, your wrong. They put the entire envent without the extras on a VHS, a DVD can hold a lot more! Anyway here is how I rate these matches:
Intercontinental Title: Chris Jericho vs. William Regal: *** 3/4 Extremly entertaining, should have been further into the event though.
The RTC vs. The Acolytes and Tazz: ** 1/2 Tazz needs to be pushed, bad. He is one of the most charismatic and good wrestlers in the WWF.
Hardcore Title: Raven vs. The Big Show vs. Kane: *** 1/2 This match should have been much further into the show, not just because of the quality but because of the 2 former WWF Champs! (Big Show and Kane)
European Title: Test vs. Eddie Guerrero: ***. A solid match that was exactly what I expected.
Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit: **** 1/2 A great WRESTLING match. Also check out their awesome 30-Minute Ultimate Submission match at Backlash 2K1!
Women's Title: Ivory vs. Chyna: * I gave this match a 1 cuz it was so 1-sided and the outcome was very predictable. I think I speak for everyone when I say I'm glad it was kept short.
Vince McMahon vs. Shane McMahon: ****. Whenever Shane O-Mac is in a PPV, you can bet your A$$ that you will not be disapointed, his Summerslam '99 bump along with a 20 foot dropkick is included!
Tag Team Titles: TLC II: The Dudley Boyz vs. The Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian: *****. I still agree that TLC 1 was unbeatable, the only new huge bump that happened was a spear of a 20 foot ladder in mid-air. I'm not saying that that is boring! I'm just saying that they did every same move that they did in TLC 1. Good to See again though!
Gimmick Battle Royal: ??? This match was simply to keep Wrestlemania about the legends and this is what the match did. (It also provided some comic relife!)
Triple H vs. The Undertaker: **** Both men proved that even though Rock and Austin may have been in the main event. They derserve to be in it too! (Although I like single main events better.)
WWF Title: The Rock vs. Steve Austin: ***** Even better than their Wrestlemania 15 match, EXCELLENT WAR! (Except for Austin's heel change)",995155200,,2394,4.310421286031042

3. Test getting stuck upside-down and Eddy and the Ref not knowing what to do.
4. The Iron Shiek

1394910,5,B000055ZK9,"Simply put, as long as you live, you may never see another PPV this good again. I'm a big backer of calling Wrestlemania III, the greatest supercard ever but Wrestlemania X-7 puts it to shame. From top to bottom (with the exception of Chyna/Ivory) just a superb card.
The standout matches are the McMahon vs. McMahon battle, Angle vs. Benoit, TLC 2, and Austin-Rock. Even Triple H/Undertaker exceeded expectations. Overall, the show features great matches, a hot crowd and two of the greatest Wrestlemania bouts ever (TLC 2, Austin/Rock).
The DVD extras include a lot of Sunday Night Heat stuff which is nice. The only negative is they threw a lot of stuff that's already on the card into extras (highlight video, feud recaps). However, they made up for it big time by including a nice recap of the next night on Raw which has never been included on a WWF DVD before.
It's this simple. If you're a casual or diehard wrestling fan you NEED this DVD. You may never see anything like this card ever again.",993081600,2,1002,4.634831460674158

The IC Title match was OK. Since Regal lost, that made it better. The 6 man tag stunk. The Hardcore match went everywhere and overthrew my expectations. The European Title Match was dumb. It was a nobodies war. Test did great and deserved the match. Benoit and Angle was boring. But the end was fair. The Women's match was boring and it helped that it was short. The street fight ruled! Finally Vince loses and gets a 4 on 2 attack (Shane, Foley, Linda, and Trish Vs. Steph and vince) Shane was amazing! TlC 2 was sweet like the first TLC match. If you saw the first TLC you would know how amazing it was. The Gimmick Match was funny. It's good to see Mean Gene and the Brain back. Sheik won but..... Game and Taker went everywhere Taker deserved every bit of his win. The Main Event everyone knew it was going to be awesome. They were wrong it was even better than that.

1394945,3,B000055ZK9,"I was mainly a wrestling fan from 1984 to 1990.  It had been about seven years since I'd watched a wrestling pay-per-view, but I heard so many good things about this Wrestlemania that I had to order it.
I remember when the ladder match was a revolutionary concept.  Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels tore the house down with just a single ladder and great ring psychology.  Yet somehow, even with five ladders, ten tables, and 87 chairs, the TLC match left me feeling rather bored, with the exception of the occasional ...moments where the participants risked death several times during the match.  These nine guys were so worried about protecting themselves that they didn't seem to have any time to tell a story in the match, just ""fall down, get up, set up the ladders and chairs, and do it again"" ad nauseum.
That's not to say that there weren't any moments that I didn't like.  Triple H/Undertaker had a rather interesting match, purists can find a lot of good things to say about Angle/Benoit, and the McMahon Civil War is a voyeurs dream come true.  But the ""Gimmick"" Battle Royal summed up my feelings about this show best.  It was great seeing some of these old timers again, but sad seeing how totally out of shape most of them had become.  It made me feel kind of old and insecure, seeing how badly time has warped the memories of my youth.  Like Thomas Wolfe says, you can't go home again.
If you're a modern day wrestling fan, ignore this review.  It's not for you, because we're not on the same wavelength.  But if you are another 80's wrestling fan refugee like me wanting to see what's become of the spectacle (and don't have access to RAW and Smackdown for some reason or other), let me just say that wrestling is totally different from your fan days, and you might be better off picking up a copy of Wrestlemania III, or Best of Wrestlemania so you can absorb the new product in a smaller dose.",991785600,,1909,4.504347826086956

BEST PPV OF ALL TIME",991353600,,492,4.051546391752577
1394947,5,B000055ZK9,"What more can you say about any WrestleMania event? I always get a funny feeling in my stomach! They get me every time! These events have proven time and time again how masterful and entertaining wrestling can be! I really think that if Vince McMahon can top this next year with WrestleMania X-Eight, then WWF should become a religion. Oh, my God!
The opening match involving Chris Jericho defending the WWF Intercontinental Title was a great opener, involving some old-school wrestling techniques. Y2J overcomes the odds and retains his title following the Lionsault.
In a huge Six-Man Tag Team Match, Tazz teams up with the Acolytes to face the lecturous Right To Censor (Bull Buchanan, Goodfather & Val Venis). Ol' White Socks didn't walk away with the victory in this one (Thank, God!), and I believe that this was one of the most entertaining Six-Man Tag Team Matches ever fought. I am glad that Bradshaw lived up to his speech about winning at WrestleMania, and did so after the Clothesline From Hell on the Goodfather.
Raven defended the WWF Hardcore Title against Kane and the Big Show. Poor Raven! No doubt a WrestleMania victory in retaining his Hardcore Title over these two monsters would have made him the happiest man alive, but sadly that was not the case. In what has to be considered a HARD grueling match down to the very CORE (No pun intended! Seriously!) this one brought comedy and carnage in true WrestleMania fashion! I loved it, especially the golf cart ride! Heh-heh! Kane wins the WWF Hardcore Title following a huge elbow drop from the stage pinning (surprisingly) the Big Show! Hard luck, Raven!
Eddie Guerrero challenged Test for the WWF European Title in a reasonable speed vs power match-up! In the end, after some interference by both of his Radical buddies, speed prevails after Eddie bashes Test with the title to win the title. Hope your proud of yourself, Eddie!
Kurt Angle was challenged by Chris Benoit in this match which surprisingly received no hype at all. No hype, obviously made these two determined to put on a true show stealer in the greatest form of wrestling ever witnessed. They turned a wrestling match into a pier-6 brawl. In the end, as expected, the ""Olympic Hero"" grabs the Rabid Wolverine's tights into a roll-up predicament to steal the win. Very entertaining match!
Ivory (motor-mouth) defends the WWF Women's Title, which she never deserved, against Chyna, the Ninth Wonder of the World, who has not surprisingly ever been the WWF Women's Champion. When you can beat men like Chyna can I'm sure you wouldn't be interested in the Women's Title! She is a former WWF Intercontinental Champion and coincidentally the first ever female Intercontinental Champion. Well done, Chyna! An expected victory in this short yet highly anticipated contest.
Vince McMahon and Shane McMahon in a Street Fight. Many surprises along the way in this one. Street Fight is at its ultimate best in this anything-goes affair. Vince's actions in recent months (the affair with Trish Stratus, keeping his wife heavily sedated, etc.) were all built up to this Street Fight at WrestleMania and both of the McMahon boys show us what they are made of. After one hell-of-a low blow from Linda, the WWF Chairman is left to the mercy of Mick Foley and Shane McMahon. He gets no mercy and after an unbelieveable drop-kick stunt from Shane involving a trash can, Vince is finally defeated.
TLC II - Dudley Boyz defend the Tag Team Titles (once again at WrestleMania) against Edge & Christian and the Hardy Boyz. Oh, my God! What a masterpiece of talent. Tables, Ladders & Chairs! Oh, my! No one would have ever thought that these 3 teams could capture the magic of the first TLC Match, but they beat all odds. With new accomplices Rhyno and Spike Dudley, and Lita getting into the fray, this one had a heart-stopping feel to it! I cannot wait for the next TLC! Edge & Christian prove again why they so reek of awesomeness by winning TLC again and becoming seven-time WWF Tag Team Champions, and who may I ask has ever done that before? Of course they couldn't have done it without a little help from Rhyno, they've just got friends in high places, really HIGH places (pun intended)!
Gimmick Battle Royal reunited legendary wrestlers, who are getting on a bit, but it is good to see the wrestlers you loved growing-up with. The Iron Sheik, who I have never heard of, wins this one last eliminating Hillbilly Jim. Sgt. Slaughter locks on the Cobra Clutch to his arch-nemesis in true sore-loser method.
Undertaker and Triple H. No stipulation added, nothing on the line, just two of the greatest wrestlers who have never met one-on-one on any Pay-Per-View before. Triple H, who retained his WWF Title last year at WrestleMania, which the Undertaker was absent from, gets his just-desserts in a classic match that turned into the second Street Fight of the night when the referee was intentionally beaten up. The Undertaker, the homeboy of Houston, shows the Game why he truly is an American Badass, after he takes Triple H for his first and Last Ride (another pun intended).
Stone Cold Steve Austin won the Royal Rumble 2001, earlier this year, eliminating Kane! The Rock won the WWF Title at No Way Out, after defeating Kurt Angle. RAW! Rock-Austin-WrestleMania! No two men have ever received legendary status like these two. The Rattlesnake and the People's Champion, although they have met before (WrestleMania XV, when Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated The Rock, who was a heel, to win the WWF Championship), the fans always wanted to know who the better man truly was in this sequel to WrestleMania XV. Did they find out who the better man was? Yes, they did! Did the better man win? No, he didn't! This was truly a masterpiece of wrestling! All hype that surrounded this match was worth the wait! It was an absolute treasure. But all expectations were false. Yes! This match was brutal! Yes! Both men sweat and bled for the title! No! A true champion didn't leave WrestleMania! In what has to be considered the greatest upset (in more ways than one) Stone Cold defeated The Rock, with the help of (brace yourself) Mr. McMahon! A man who has made Steve Austin's life hell and has tried to prevent him from ever being the WWF Champion screwed The Rock for the second consecutive WrestleMania giving the victory to the Rattlesnake. It was one hell of a job for Austin to win the title. A Stone Cold Stunner proved impossible to put The Rock away, a chair shot from Vince McMahon proved not enough, but after several chair shots from an outraged and determined Stone Cold, The Rock lost the WWF Title in a sickening occurence. What fans saw that night will keep worldwide watchers of the sport talking for years to come! Austin and McMahon, two long-time rivals, shook hands and it seemed now that after at least three years, Mr. McMahon finally had the WWF Champion he had always wanted in Stone Cold Steve Austin. With that, Stone Cold added insult to injury by blasting The Rock with what was his title belt and the two left the Reliant Astrodome leaving the fans in Houston and what was left of The Rock in total confusion. As the 67,000 in the Astrodome exited the arena themselves, one question was left on their minds: ""Why, Stone Cold? Why""
WWF WrestleMania X-Seven is ultimately superb. I suggest you rent it, buy it on video and DVD as well! Anything that can get you to see it.",991094400,,7410,4.749418153607448

Kane vs. Big Show vs. Raven: This was sloppy and cheesy... But I loved it. A pretty good hardcore match but nothing to write home about.

Get Lita and Trish out there! Vince vs. Shane: Sweet as hell for non-wrestlers. Predictable but a classic none the less. TLC2: Sweet stunts, not quite as good as TLC though... It seemed like the same bumps only slightly changed. Gimmick Battle Royal: Waste of air time that could have gone to Angle/Benoit or Jericho/Regal. HHH vs. Undertaker: A good brawl, good effort by the deadman at his last WM. SCSA vs. Rock: That's it? I said. This can't be the best PPV ever because the main event was terrible.

None of these matches were sleepers!  Everyone of them exceeded any expectations I may have had.  But the high spots for me were TLC II and the Championship match.  Each of the teams in TLC II should be proud of themselves for the effort they put into it.  Honestly, after what they went through, I don't see how they are all still walking around.  And it looked like Stone Cold was gonna cripple the Rock with multiple, relentless chair shots in the Championship match.  What a bloody battle!  At one point, I almost thought I was watching WrestleMania 13 because The Rock had Stone Cold in the Sharpshooter and Austin was a bloody mess!

1394966,5,B000055ZK9,"WOW!!!  What an amazing beginning to a new year.  The Superbowl of Wrestling can't keep amazing me anymore than what i saw on that night.  I was feeling good that night i was so glad i got the PPV it was awesome.  And to see Bobby Heenan and Gene Okerland back in the WWF was cool.  I think the two matches that got to me the most were the WWF title match between Austin and The Rock and the match between the Undertaker and Triple H.  I think it was kind of cool that Triple H was lead in with his song The Game by Motorhead.  I loved it..  The match itself didn't deny that it could a main event in any arena any where i mean just the antomosity between those two men.  They had a lot of blood in the match and i thought Triple H got killed when he got dropped off the stage to the floor.  The main event itself was nothing short of spectacular i mean just 35 to 40 minutes of Austin and The Rock just beating the crap out of each other i just sat there in amazment that these two men would go that long and impress and audience of about 67,000 people is just amazing.  Plus the fact that these two go way back to 2 years previous at Wrestlmania 15 when these two men met each other for the same belt and also beat the living crap out of each other then.  Please i beg of you people get this movie when it comes out also for your info the DVD version of this comes out 6/5/01 if you want to have both for you collection i certainly do because i have almost all 17 Wrestlemanias i just need Wrestlemania 15 on DVD and Video because i think it is cool to have both because it will be a collectors item when i get older.  So good luck if you can get both i certainly will.  Also i hope you enjoy this event because this is one momentous night in wrestling.",990144000,,1755,3.962962962962963

1394990,5,B000055ZK9,"I have over 250 wrestling tapes in my collection and have seen all the Wrestle Manias and all the WWF's pay-per-view event form 1985 onwards.  To be quite honest this 2001 annual Wrestle Mania is quite possibly the best Wrestle Mania and quite possibly the best pay-per-view event put forward by any Wrestling company and thats a lot of shows.  I waited the day after the show all day while I was at college to watch the show.  And I wasn't disappointed.  While the card doesn't contain a, ""best match ever candidate.""  It is a card that is very consistant and delivers some absolute stunning effort and a stunning crowd at that.  The show starts a bit slow with some of the lower card matches been short but that is not a bad thing, because if they had been longer they may have dragged on.  The card starts hitting amazing with Benoit vs. Angle which is a very good wrestling match.  The card truly has something for everyone as Shane vs. Vince shows, while not been great wrestling the emotion and the story telling in this match are top notch and Shane does some crazy stuff.  While not been a big fan of stunt wrestling the TLC match blows you away and is nothing short of amazing.  The Gimmick battle royal is not for everyone but provides some comic stuff for longtime fans and is kept short which again is good.  HHH vs. Taker is not the best match ever but provides a enthrawling brawl and many people I know have said this was a good match while I do not agree I can see others been keen on this.  The card climaxes with Austin vs. Rock I saw these two fight live at Sheffield in 1999 and the crowd reaction was breathtaking and that was from 12744 people now put nearly 70000 infront of it in Houston, after both men popularity had grown, triple the length of the match and up the stakes and you have what may be Wrestle Mania's greatest ever main event.  Some longer time fans may recognise some of the spots in the match from the 1996/97 Austin vs. Hart feud too which caught my eye and made me like the match even more as this match builds on Austins previous battles with Hart.  The DVD is bound to have like hours and hours of added stuff plus the Axess festival which by all accounts was pretty awesome its always good to see the workers out of the ring and in the carnival atmosphere of Wrestle Mania weekend and this is the oppotunity.  I whole heartly say to anyone if I had to pick five wrestling tapes (discs) to take to a dessert island this would be on that list and I have a big list to chose from.",988761600,,2523,4.293248945147679

After two top notch ppvs (""Rumble"" and ""No Way Out""), comes this epic event which will probably be talked about for a long time (though I could have lived w/o hearing Limp Bizkit's ""My Way"" every 10 seconds).  Jericho and Regal is a great opener and the Acolytes/Tazz vs. RTC match is much better than I thought.  The Hardcore match between Raven, Kane, and Big Show was pretty good but a little boring.  Would have been better if someone who wasn't involved in the match took advantage of the 24/7 rule and got the pin.  Had a nice finisher though.  China vs. Ivory was just total garbage.  I can't believe anyone wastes their time with these matches.  Test and Guerrero is also pretty weak.  There wasn't much of a plot between these two and there wasn't follwing the match either.  Benoit and Angle put on a nice match with mostly straight mat wrestling until they turn it up a few notches towards the end.  Solid match. Vince and Shane was also much better than it sounded with Shane doing a ring post to ring post dive at the end.  How he does this stuff I have no idea. TLC 2 is just as amazing as the first one (yet a lot of the same stuff happend).  The Dudleys, the Hardeys, and Edge and Christian put on a great show and E&C are tag champs once again!  The Gimmick Battle Royal was funny and nothing else but it wasn't good either.  Though it was nice to see Sgt. Slaughter give Iron Shiek the Cobra Claw.  Unertaker and Triple H had a great match for the most part (though some of the falls and what not were over sold just a bit).  Triple H bouts Taker with a sledge during a last ride but doesn't do it hard enough for the win either.  Rock and Austin was a damn good main event.  At the begining they announced it was no disqualifications which told me something was up and then the two biggest names in the federation just beat the crap out of each other.  About 20 Minutes into the match, they both have both bloodied each other pretty good and then out comes Vince.  Rock goes for a pin and WOAH!  Austin heel turn as Vince helps Stone Cold.  The end is all too dramatic as Austin smacks Rock with a chair a countless number of times and finally gets the Rock down for the pin.  The unthinkable happend.  Austin turned heel at the end of one of the most spectacular matches of Rock or Austin's career.  Definately a must see.",987552000,,2407,4.258278145695364

I have one word to describe this match...... AMAZING!!!!! How Shane manages to pull off the ring post-to-ring post drop kick I will never know!!!

TLC was amazing with some amazing stunts including a Sweantom bomb from Jeff Hardy from a ladder through a table. The Undertaker vs HHH match was very interesting with the 2 wrestlers fighting through the crowd. The WWF title was my favourite and it was made no dq.

The greatest match of all time was Stone Cold vs The Rock, who were both in their prime on top of there game during what was the end on the Monday Night War as WCW was purchased by Vince McMahon. But on that final Nitro episode, Shane McMahon signed the contract before Vince had a chance to and that started the ""Invasion"" storyline of WCW coming into WWF at that time trying to takeover and put them out of business. This was a classic setup for what was to come as Shane went one on one vs Vince. Undertaker's first match vs HHH where Taker came out on top. TLC 2 between the Dudleys with Spike in their corner, Hardys with Lita in theirs and Edge and Christian with Rhyno in their corner. Chyna winning the women's title against Ivory on this night. But nothing was more anticipated than Austin/Rock.

7931388,5,B000055ZK9,"WrestleMania X7 is my all time favorite WrestleMania ever. WrestleMania X7 is my second WrestleMania. I watched this PPV when I was in high school and this PPV blew me away. This PPV had many memories that will never be forgotten ever. Here is the match list, I will rank them either 1-10 stars.

WWE Intercontinental Championship Match. ""Y2J"" Chris Jericho (champion) vs. William Regal. Nothing special, but a good match to open WrestleMania. The former WWE Commissioner started to target the injured left shoulder of Y2J with an exposed turnbuckle and an submission maneuver, but it cannot help Regal and Y2J wins a clean pin with the Lionsault. 7 stars

Winner and still WWE Intercontinental Champion: Chris Jericho.

6 Man Tag Team match. APA and Tazz vs R.T.C. Short match, but it is a good match for Bradshaw later JBL to wrestle at his home. Stevie Richards tried to interfere in the match but it was foiled by Jacqueline. Both teams do their best and JBL wins with the Clothesline from Hell on Goodfather. 6 stars.

Winners: APA and Tazz.

WWE Hardcore Championship Match. Raven (champion) vs. Kane vs. Big Show. One of my favorites. Raven tried to run away like a rat, but it was a nice try. Both men beat each other all over the area, Kane threw Raven through a glass window, Kane and Big Show went through doors, walls, and Kane kicked Big Show and Raven from the stage to the floor for the pin. 8.5 stars.

Winner and new WWE Hardcore Champion: Kane.

WWE European Championship Match. Test (champion) vs. Eddie Guerrero. Great match for those late wrestlers. The late Eddie did a great job doing trademark Lie, Cheat and Steal from the help of Perry Saturn against the late Test. R.I.P. Test and Eddie Guerrero, thank you for that great match. 8 stars.

Winner and new WWE European Champion: Eddie Guerrero.

Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit. Great match. It started to get a little bored, but it become more intense. Both of those technical wrestlers locked each other in wrestling holds and suplex each other made this match great. Kurt Angle cheated when he grabbed the tights of the late Rabid Wolverine for the pin. 8.5 stars.

Winner: Kurt Angle.

WWE Women's Championship Match. Chyna vs. Ivory (champion). Not a very good match, but just a simple woman squash match. Ivory was manhandled by Chyna. Chyna wins with a simple Gorilla Press Drop. 1 star.

Winner and new WWE Women's Champion: Chyna.

Street Fight Match. Shane McMahon vs. Vince McMahon. One of my favorites. It all started when Vince had an affair with the Hall of Famer, Trish Stratus and he bought WCW until his son signed the contract. This match had a lot of intensity. In this match, Trish turns face, she slaps Vince until Stephanie starts a cat fight with Trish. The highlight in this match is Shane doing an turnbuckle to turnbuckle Van Terminator on Vince for the pin. 9 stars.

Winner: Shane McMahon.

TLC II for the WWE Tag Team Championship. Edge and Christian vs. The Dudley Boyz (champions) vs. The Hardy Boyz. WOW, this is the star match in this PPV. My all time favorite. There are a lot of sick chair shots, awesome moves from all of those men, sick dives from ladders by the Hardys, Edge and Christian, and awesome interferes of Lita, Rhyno, and Spike Dudley. There are a lot of sick highlights in this match like Jeff Hardy did a sick Swaton on Rhyno while he is on a table from a 15 ft. ladder, Edge did a sick spear on Jeff Hardy from a 15 ft. ladder while Jeff is holding on the titles, and Rhyno pushed Matt Hardy and Buh Buh Ray (later Bully Ray in TNA) while they are on a ladder to a stack of 4 tables at ringside. Edge and Christian won with the help of Rhyno. There are no boring spots and this is the most awesome match in WrestleMania history.
10 stars.

Winners and new WWE Tag Team Champions: Edge and Christian.

19 Man Gimmick Battle Royal. What in the blue hell is this? This is not a good match. A clown, a hockey player, a dumpster man, a sailor, a repo man, a turkey man, a wannabe singer, and some legend wrestlers throwing each other out of the top ropes. The Iron Sheik wins when he threw Sgt. Slaughter out of the top ropes. 3.5 stars.

Winner: Iron Sheik.

HHH vs. Undertaker. This is not a match, this is a BRAWL. Both men beat the holy hell out of each other all over the area. The Deadman knocks the referee out cold and he and HHH continue their brawl all over the area. Taker made a sick chokeslam to HHH from a camera tower to the floor. HHH tried to use his trademark sledgehammer on the Deadman, but nice try. Taker wins with the Last Ride. 9.5 stars.

Winner: Undertaker.

No DQ Main Event Match for the WWE Championship: The Rock (champion) vs Stone Cold Steve Austin. One of my favorites. This match is very, very, and very intense. Both men are bloodied during this intense match and a lot of near falls. Vince interfered this match to help Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Rattlesnake does whatever it takes to win, he used the WWE title, but it did not work, he made a lot of sick chair shots to The Rock for the pin after The Rock kicked out of the Stunner. 10 stars

Winner and new WWE Champion: Stone Cold Steve Austin.

Since his Wrestlemania 10 commentary debut in 1994, this was Jerry Lawler's first Wrestlemania he didn't commentate due to a dispute he had with the company, causing him to walk out. Paul Heyman would be a replacement.

1.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Chris Jericho (c) vs William Regal

The feud leading up to this match was quite an interesting one to say the least. It all started with Jericho peeing in William Regal's tea! These 2 brought a unique style of wrestling to the match for the opener. Jericho wins this fast-paced action match with a Lionsault on Regal

____________________________________________________________

2.) RTC (Bull Buchanan, Val Venis, and The Goodfather) w/Steven Richards vs Tazz and APA w/Jacqueline

A short match that's won by APA  and Tazz following a Clothesline From Hell from Bradshaw on Goodfather. Thankfully this was a short match because the fans were never too invested in RTC and I'm pretty sure they didn't want to see someone of APA's caliber in the ring with RTC. The quickness of this match saved it from becoming a bore and putting any kind of damper on the PPV

Stephanie McMahon finds Trish Stratus wheeling the comatose wheelchair bound Linda McMahon around backstage and asks Trish to get champagne, strawberries, and ice for the post-match celebration when Vince McMahon beats Shane McMahon

____________________________________________________________

3.) WWF Hardcore Championship Match: Raven (c) vs Kane vs Big Show

Once again another fun and exciting Hardcore match to happen at Wrestlemania. 2 giants and a former 2x ECW Champion in one Hardcore match? You know you're in for a treat! Raven attacked Kane before Big Show even came out but once he did, things were truly underway. It didn't take long for the match to go into the crowd and eventually backstage, which is where most of the match happened, so we got some nice backstage fighting. The end of the match ends at the entrance ramp, where Kane knocks Raven and Big Show off the stage. Kane dives off the stage onto both of them with a leg drop and the Big Red Machine is your new Hardcore Champion! This would be the last great Hardcore match to happen at Wrestlemania.

____________________________________________________________

4.) WWF European Championship Match: Eddie Guerrero w/Perry Saturn vs Test (c)

An overall solid wrestling match, seeing Guerrero's high flying technical skills go up against Test's brawling skills. Although Test lacked proper charisma at a character, he was pretty cool and likable babyface. Dean Malenko ends up getting involved and distracts the ref, while Saturn hands Eddie the European title to hit Test with. Just like that, the match is over and Eddie is the new European Champion

____________________________________________________________

5.) Kurt Angle vs Chris Benoit

Classic wrestling at its finest, featuring 2 of the greatest technical wrestlers in history. This match is purely amazing with everything you'd expect to see. It was a great move on WWF's part to put these 2 on the card and let them do their thing as I believe they originally weren't booked to be a part of the card. Angle manages to steal the win using a roll up on Benoit grabbing the tights. This match was so awesome that Benoit and Angle would fight each other plenty of times over the next 2 years following this PPV and even formed a short-lived tag team with each other in 2002!

____________________________________________________________

6.) WWF Women's Championship Match: Ivory (c) vs Chyna

And the horrible diva matches at Wrestlemania continue for another year. The feud was mediocre in some ways and the match didn't deliver either. Chyna gets the win and the crowd goes wild, but I'm pretty sure that was only because they couldn't stand the RTC and less about seeing Chyna win that travesty of a match. This would be Chyna's last Wrestlemania.

7.) Street Fight: Shane McMahon vs Vince McMahon w/Stephanie McMahon (Mick Foley as Special Guest Referee)

The McMahon Family was always dysfunctional back then but this was the first time that the dysfunction really came to a head. For the first time ever, two McMahons fought each other in the ring. Vince vs Shane; Father vs Son. The match really told the story at how personal the feud had gotten leading up to the match. So much happened in this match that truly made it a memorable one. Trishs face turn by slapping Vince in the face, Stephanies involvement with Shane, Linda rising to her feet to one of the biggest pops in Wrestling history to get revenge on Vince, along with Shanes insane coast to coast spot, among other brutality made this match GREAT. This was probably Vince's greatest Wrestlemania match and probably his greatest match in general

8.) WWF Tag Team Championship TLC II Match: The Hardy Boyz vs Edge and Christian vs The Dudley Boyz (c)

A rematch to the Triangle Ladder Match that had happened at the previous Wrestlemania, only tables and chairs were added to the mix this time. This match is pure gold. Crashing through tables, swinging chairs, and leaping ladders, this match had it all on the menu. Add a side of interference from Spike Dudley, Lita, and Rhyno and you get loaded mayhem. Edge and Christian coming out on top once again was the main concourse. How fitting that the final chapter of the Edge and Christian/Hardyz/Dudleyz feud saga ended at the best Wrestlemania! Edge and Christian's third victory over the other 2 teams in this match showed why they were the kings of Ladder/TLC matches

9.) Gimmick Battle Royal: The Bushwhackers vs Duke the Dumpster Droese vs Iron Shiek vs Earthquake vs The Goon vs Doink the Clown vs Kamala vs Repo Man vs Jim Cornette vs Nikolai Volkoff vs Michael Hayes vs One Man Gang vs Gobbledy Gooker vs Tugboat vs Hillbilly Jim vs Brother Love vs Sgt. Slaughter

This was basically one big nostalgic act featuring some of the WWF's best and worst gimmicks from the 80s and early 90s. Mene Gene Okerlund and Bobby Heenan even replaced J.R and Paul Heyman on commentary for the match. Quick and somewhat fun battle royal that ends with Sgt. Slaughter winning

10.) Triple H vs The Undertaker

This feud had grown extremely personal leading up to the match and with there being no managers at ringside, this one was going to be an all out brawl! This was one of Undertaker's best Wrestlemania matches and there were so many close calls, when I first watched this match, I was more than assured that Triple H was walking out the winner on this night. There's no stopping the Deadman though, as Undertaker pulled through played and beat The Game and took the streak to 9-0. It'd be another 10 years before Undertaker and Triple H had a rematch at 2011's Wrestlemania 27 that came close to outshining this one.

11.) No Disqualifications WWF Championship Match: Stone Cold Steve Austin vs The Rock (c)

The match that everyone had been waiting for. Austin vs Rock II for the WWF Championship at Wrestlemania. The pre-match package video for this match was powerful with Limp Bizkit's My Way playing. Even though he was not from Houston, Austin was solidly the favorite in this match as a state favorite. Words truly can't even describe the match. You just have to watch it to see it yourself. Saying it's a classic or legendary or the best of all time doesn't do this match justice. The match was made No DQ at the last minute, which meant Rock and Austin were going to be the living hell out of each other beginning, middle, and end in this match.

The ending still shocks me to this day. Stone Cold is my favorite of all time and was my favorite as a kid. Seeing him shake hands with Vince McMahon really crushed me inside. J.R verbally sold the hell out of Austin's heel turn, acting like it was quite possibly the worst thing to happen in the history of humanity. To complete a perfect ice cream sundae, you need a cherry. Wrestlemania 17 was the perfect sundae and Austin vs Rock was the cherry that topped it all off. The best Wrestlemania match of all time to end the best Wrestlemania of all time!",1396396800,,8592,5.068794326241135
