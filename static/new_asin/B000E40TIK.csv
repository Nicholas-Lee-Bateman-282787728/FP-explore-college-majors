2488442,4,B000E40TIK,"Singing sensation, Liz Wetherly (Leslie Uggams) takes a solo roadtrip in order to get away from it all. Unfortunately, her Rolls Royce breaks down in the middle of the redneck section of hell! Liz is forced to stay at a rustic lodge while her car is being fixed. Well, said lodge is run by alcoholic has-been Bertha (Shelley Winters from Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?, Whatever's The Matter With Helen?, etc.) and her leering, Elvis-like, young lover, Eddie (Michael Christian), who are both totally nuts! If they're not bad enough, we get Slim Pickens (Dr. Strangelove, The Howling) as the perverted sheriff, Dub Taylor as the twisted justice of the peace, and Ted ""Lurch"" Cassidy as the manic mechanic! Liz finds herself at the mercy of people who are not just racist hicks, but dangerously deranged as well! Her nightmare takes the form of rape, humiliation, and a mock wedding! Ted Cassidy's character seems to be the only one w/ an ounce of brains or heart! The rest are slobbering lunatics w/ Liz's degradation as their latest group project. I kept hoping Liz would start wacking these horrid hillbillies! I mean, she suffers so many indignities for such a long time, the movie is mostly Liz's frustrating torture session. Although this agony goes on for quite a while, trust me, the final is worth the wait...",1199404800,8,1311,4.831111111111111
2488443,5,B000E40TIK,"""Poor Pretty Eddie"" AKA ""Black Vengeance"".If you are easily offended By ""Black Exploitation Horror Films"" and stereotypical films I recommend you not to watch this film. If you are a lover of horror exploitation films, like me :-) this is a gem for you! I consider this a cult classic. Excellent star cast: Lesle Uggams as ""liz"", Michael Christian as""Eddie""(Terror On The Beach),Shelley Winters (A Place In The Sun), Ted Cassidy (The Addam's Family),Dub Taylor(Them!),Slim Pickens(Beyond The Poseidon Adventure).  ""Liz"" played by Leslie Uggams is on vacation and her car breaks down in a southern town and she  takes a room at a motel where the motel clerk ""Eddie"" played by Micheal Christian falls in love with liz and will stop at nothing to keep her from leaving the motel. The end has a nice little twist to it. The Dvd  picture and sound is very good.",1140307200,11,856,4.809523809523809
2488444,5,B000E40TIK,this is another stellar performance by Shelly Winters as a disturbed Diva and the amazing cast that supports her seems to take the directors slant in stride creating one of the most haunting films that I have ever seen and look forward to seeing again. Perhaps all wedding planners should have a mandatory screening before the first thing is ever engraved.,1110412800,2,356,4.852459016393443
2488445,2,B000E40TIK,"In the second half of her career Shelley Winters seemed determined to make everyone forget what a fine actress she once was (A Double Life, A Place In The Sun, Night Of The Hunter, Diary Of Anne Frank, Alfie, to name a few of her memorable films). Her post-Poseidon Adventure filmography is a list of forgettable films with forgettable performances, and Poor Pretty Eddie is no exception. Leslie Uggams finds herself stranded in a southern redneck town (are there any other kinds of southern towns in movies?), with a population whose collective IQ barely gets into three-digit territory (are there any other kinds of redneck populations in movies?). She is being held prisoner by a country singer/Elvis wanna-be, and is subject to repeated rapes by her captor and repeated humiliation by the townsfolk. If this is your cup of tea, then by all means go for it, but otherwise just avoid it.",1342137600,,889,4.855263157894737
2488446,1,B000E40TIK,This movie was not filmed in 3-D. This release is computer generated and manipulated. They are placing two slightly offset images in a stereo window and it does not have true depth.,1332374400,2,181,4.6875
2488447,3,B000E40TIK,"As a '70s exploitation flick, this is just ok--I've seen much better and I've seen worse. Noted singer (Leslie Uggams) becomes stranded in hicksville after a gig and becomes the object of desire for the slightly off-balance wanna-be entertainer of the film's title. Problem is, Eddie is the ""kept man"" of Big Bertha (Shelley Winters) and she ain't about to give up her prize stud!

On paper it sounds like a dream: Ted Cassidy (Lurch from ""The Addams Family""), Shelley Winters and Leslie Uggams in a tale of backwoods rape and depravity, but somehow it doesn't live up to its potential. Winters gets off a few great one-liners (""I don't care if she farts Chanel No. 5"", ""Eddie knows alot about poontang but don't know nothing about women"") and calls Uggams a ""vicious black little b**ch"", and Eddie (Michael Christian) looks great in a wifebeater, but somehow it just isn't enough to save the movie. **NOTE** See the screen grabs I posted in the Images section of this product.

The screenplay was written by B.W. Sandefur, who must have loved writing these backwoods stories; he's the guy responsible for the worst episode of ""Charlie's Angels""--the dreadful ""Moonshinin' Angels"" from the show's final season.

Okay to see once; but IMO it doesn't have much replay value.

Three Stars.",1329609600,2,1286,4.912442396313364
2488448,4,B000E40TIK,"Wow. This ranks right up there with Deliverance and Texas Chainsaw Massacre in depicting the South as the home of redneck degenerates. It morphs from sort of Southern gothic to blaxploitation to horror. For the price I think this blu ray does a fine job -- IMDB says the technical process was 35 mm, but in those days people tended to shoot film a bit funny. I'm no expert on filming, but you'll find a fair number of seventies titles that look rather dark and gritty.  DNR'ed to death?  Well, I guess it didn't matter to me, because everything was completely clear but the whole film still looked gritty and gruesome. It was far from unwatchable -- maybe some folks need to check their TV settings, as it looked pretty great on mine. Plus you get some extras, chief amongst which is a making of featurette that is different from the usual dreck.  Needless to say this film had one heck of a shady history!  Ignore the DNR purists and enjoy this wacky movie for what it is, and it sure ain't The Godfather or The Deer Hunter, in terms of picture quality or budget. It is Ted Cassidy (his finest role, I think), Leslie Uggams, Shelly Winters, Dub Taylor, Slim Pickens, and Michael Christian in a story with no dull moments, if you can stomach it.",1306022400,,1245,4.47136563876652
2488449,4,B000E40TIK,"This film is a bit of a contradiction. On one hand it is one of the most over the top offensive films I've ever seen, yet the sex and violence is relatively tame, even by 1975 standards. It's also one of the cheapest of the cheap, yet it has a name cast and boasts some pretty impressive filmmaking. It isn't a ""good"" movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it isn't a bad one either.

The acting isn't too shabby. Uggams does a good job of balancing toughness and vulnerability; and Winters is actually quite sympathetic as the over the hill burlesque queen. Slim Pickens and Dub Taylor are a hillbilly Mutt and Jeff comedy team that come off as threatening as well. The Sam Peckinpaugh slow motion scenes are actually quite brilliant, as is the jarring editing.

This is a movie that is difficult to describe and hard to believe. If you enjoy exploitation fare, this is just about as far as it goes in that direction.

The transfer is OK, with dense, opaque shadows and a hefty dose of scratch removal. But it looks fine for what it is. The sound sucks, but that was due to the way it was recorded. Well.worth the money if you want a film to shock and horrify your friends and make them think poorly of your taste in movies. I thought it was a lot of fun.",1305417600,6,1262,4.3164556962025316
2488450,1,B000E40TIK,"I have to tell ya of the four blu rays I own by this company, this is the worst. The movie is a true drive in classic (oh how I long for The Farmer to get a DVD release) but this studio releasing these public domain titles is total rip off!! These are suppose to be high definition...hell I've seen VHS tapes that look better! This studio needs to stop with using DNR. Someone does not know how or what 'remastering' is. This particular blu ray is unwatchable! Like another reviewer stated, they DNRd the crap out of this. This studio needs to stop making blu rays, because idiots like me keep hoping they will get better. NOT!! They are getting worse. There should be a law for companies ripping off the consumers. This company is a travesty!!! Aren't there a standard or organization that regulates what standard is used for the blu ray medium. I am pissed at this company! These movies they are releasing deserve proper transfers for us fans to enjoy them. I give the movie four stars, the blu ray zero. A total rip off!! Even if you are a fan of this movie, avoid this version because it will make you mad like I am. Sad.",1304035200,7,1125,4.3364928909952605
2488451,3,B000E40TIK,"Wow. A snotty diva takes off on vacation alone in her Rolls looking for a quiet place to wind down after a grueling...singing of the national anthem at a sporting event?  Naturally, she breaks down and ends up at a rundown hunters lodge run by an ex-burlesque star and her much younger Elvis wanna-be boyfriend.  About the time you're getting bored with it, they throw in a rape scene intertwined with footage of two dogs going at it.  It's the production style that hooks you from that point forward, and it just keeps getting more bizarre for our poor starlet.  And if you think the cast is impressive for this genre, just wait till you read what the budget was in the production essay.

The Blu-ray edition was released by ""HD Cinema Classics"" and they DNR'd the crap out of it, though there's a sequence several minutes long with streaking that inexplicably survives.  The image as a whole is REALLY soft, as in if you have a good DVD copy (WAS there ever a good DVD release?), there's almost no point in getting this.  The compressed Dolby Digital soundtrack sounds probably like it did through the in-car drive-in speakers...distorted shrieking and all.

Still, the movie itself a must have for drive-in exploitation fans, and perhaps a mildly amusing distraction for others.",1303862400,12,1281,4.764705882352941
2488452,2,B000E40TIK,"The problem with this DVD film is that it is not remastered. It is simply a VHS-quality film that is transferred to the DVD format.
This really annoyed me, as I wasted my money. I should have bought this from an official seller such as Virgin or other movie store.
Not only that, but something suffered in the transfer, and as a result, when you pause a scene it is even blurrier than it was originally on VHS!",1272758400,3,410,4.269230769230769
2488453,1,B000E40TIK,"Leslie Uggams is another tragic example of multi-talented beautiful black female entertainers who face institutionalized racial discrimination in Hollywood. Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, and Eartha Kitt had to sing for their supper. Halle Berry hasn't had a decent role in years while her aging peers - Nicole Kidman, Meg Ryan, and Julianne Moore - continue to flourish.  Is there any movie that Kidman HAS NOT been in?  Surely her long run is the result of a backroom deal - the Supreme payoff for keeping her mouth shut and not outing you know who!

And poor poor pathetic me for watching EVERY disgusting minute of this tragedy while waiting for Leslie to do something other than look stupid.",1267747200,,696,4.931623931623932
2488454,1,B000E40TIK,According to the information on Amazons website the run time should be 92 minutes. What they sent me was the cut version run time 88 minutes. After asking for a replacement they again sent me the 88 minutes version. So finally I had to return both DVDs. They didn't correct the information on the website.,1210464000,4,305,4.5636363636363635
8105600,4,B000E40TIK,"I admit, I only skimmed through this movie looking for scenes with Leslie Uggams singing and dancing. Unfortunately, she doesn't sing, but she does scream a couple of times. Of course, she deserves top billing  fabulous ending!",1522627200,,227,5.135135135135135
8105601,5,B000E40TIK,"Elizabeth Wetherly is a black jazz singer who's car breaks down in backwoods hillbilly hell where she meet's faded starlet, Bertha (Shelly Winters) and Eddie Collins, a wanna-be famous country crooner. Eddie stalls on fixing Liz's car in order to hatch his devious plans much to the chagrin of lovestruck Bertha. Soon Liz is stuck in a living nightmare in this forgotten drive-in gem. The story not only holds up quite well even more than 4 decades after the film came out, but also trumps most Hollywood films that deal with racism now. Never browbeating you, instead just saying it matter of factly. This film should be better known and is extremely watchable for the performances of Winters and Slim Pickens alone. (the other actors do a great job as well, but seem underdeveloped especially Ted Cassidy best known for being Lurch in the Addams family, here as Keno).",1517184000,,870,4.845637583892618
8105602,5,B000E40TIK,One of the best weird 70's movies ever. Watch the vhs of Heartbreak Motel to see how they altered the entire movie to make it a drama not a thriller and gave it a happy ending! lol,1450396800,,180,3.891891891891892

8105604,5,B000E40TIK,"I remember getting this mess of a film on a Star Classic VHS back in the day.  Great grindhouse 70s film that is sure to be quickly dismissed by some but in my opinion it has something that really stays with you (hence why I randomly sought it out after all these years).  An effective combo of absurdity, humor and offensiveness.",1431734400,2,330,4.39344262295082

8105608,4,B000E40TIK,"This one is similar in tone to  1972's Deliverance.
This is a strange film indeed, I would say this has the late Ted Cassidy's best performance in a feature film, although his very small role in Butch Cassidy was great as well.
the late Shelly Winters is good as always.
They did a great job on the restoration of the film, considering how obscure the film is.
This combo pack includes BOTH a blu-ray and a DVD
Great job Cultra/Film Chest!",1355356800,,439,4.419753086419753
8105609,4,B000E40TIK,"Wow. Someone sure had it in for Shelly Winters. She makes a total fool of herself. Anyway, I owned a DVD copy and I think this is much improved. Although not really up to blu-ray standards, you can at least see what is going on. My only problem was, there wasn't an opinion on the menu to access the special features, unless they are hidden somewhere. Anyone else have this problem? Oh, yes, if you want to feel sleazy, buy this. Just watch it before you shower, not after.",1350000000,,473,4.325842696629214
