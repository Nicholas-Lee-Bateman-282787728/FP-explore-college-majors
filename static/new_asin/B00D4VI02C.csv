5774907,5,B00D4VI02C,"I love this documentary! It has really changed the way I see myself and my potential as a triathlete. If the 100 year old tennis player in Age of Champions can compete and win gold, I have no excuse to do anything but push myself and encourage others to live an active and healthy lifestyle. I bought a copy of the film for myself and another to gift to a good friend who needed a little inspiration.",1372896000,,400,4.207792207792208
5774908,5,B00D4VI02C,"This is one of those films that makes your cheeks ache from smiling. At 42, I stopped complaining about feeling old and often conjure memories of these guys - the ladies kicking butt on the basketball court, the swimming brothers, the 100+ guy playing tennis every day! A swift kick of a reminder to shut up and get moving!",1372896000,,323,4.491525423728813
5774909,5,B00D4VI02C,"as a senior center director, I want to promote  the Master Games of Alabama.  I am hoping by showing this  movie, will encourage others to participate in the games.  One is never to old to be active.",1384300800,,199,4.297297297297297
5774910,5,B00D4VI02C,"If you wish you could pole-vault and you're under the age of eighty, you have no excuse! These competitors in the National Senior Olympics prove that age is no obstacle to achieving your dreams. People as old as my grandparents, and many who are even older, are seriously involved in competitive sports. I'll admit I never would have believed there was a 100 year old tennis champion until I saw him in action. I was completely blown away, and had to seriously reconsider what (if anything!) I thought was ""impossible."" In today's youth obsessed culture, it's easy to forget the old adage that it's never too late to make a change in your life. I'm sure the elderly will find this film very uplifting, but viewers of any age will derive a lot of inspiration from Age of Champions. I certainly did.",1378857600,,797,4.619718309859155
5774911,5,B00D4VI02C,"As clich as this may sound, I found ""Age of Champions"" to be a testament to the human spirit. I found this documentary to be one of the most uplifting, inspirational, and beautiful things I've ever seen. It's easy to see while watching why this film won multiple awards. My heart fell in love with 5 different people of completely different walks of life as they trained for and competed in a competition that I never even knew existed; The National Senior Olympics. Do not be fooled: This isn't a film about ""old people."" It's about the ability we all have in ourselves to overcome ourselves and whatever adversity we are presented with, to pull things out of us that we never knew were there and to do things no one believed as possible. There are 86-year-olds pole-vaulting and grandmothers playing basketball competitively! They're chasing dreams and I find it so encouraging and refreshing! Amazing documentary. I'm changed.",1378771200,,929,4.886075949367089
5774912,5,B00D4VI02C,"I enjoyed this film just as everyone else has.  If there is one thing that is good for both body and mind it is exercise - particularly exercise in sports that you find enjoyable. From what I've seen, the separation in physical and mental well being between those who exercise and those who don't really accelerates after age 60.  The exercise does not have to be as competitive as that in the video but it does have to be demanding enough to maintain overall good health.  I feel I'm stating the obvious here but it is also obvious that a high percentage of those over 60 don't want to give up their beer and TV watching etc.

Some questions arose in my mind re the competing athletes in the video.  The interviews did not go into training methods.  The impression is left that they train only by working on their sport.  Do they also run or jog, lift weights, do calisthenics?  I would have liked to hear a little more info on that.  Do they watch their diets and weight?  I saw a highly competitive gentleman who looked like his pole vault competition would have gone much better if he dropped 20 lbs. or so.  Are they tempted to use ""anti-aging"" or performance enhancing drugs as some professional athletes have apparently done in recent years?  I hope not.  I admire then all greatly.",1374537600,,1289,4.48068669527897
5774913,5,B00D4VI02C,"Even though next to the folks in this film, I am considered a youngster at 35, I found myself absolutely connected and emotionally bound to the story that this doc tells - it's an inspirational future these 'champions' portray, and it is a reminder that life can be good to the last drop.",1373328000,,288,4.452830188679245
5774914,5,B00D4VI02C,"This film is an absolute gem!! It warmed my heart on so many levels. I've watched it with my husband, my parents, and my grandparents. Each generation was touched by the film in a unique way. I can't recommend it enough!",1372896000,,220,4.390243902439025
5774915,5,B00D4VI02C,"This film tells the story of several older athletes hoping to bring home the gold in the Senior Olympics.  This inspiring movie features old people living the life you want to have you you are an elderly person.  With lots of human emotion, hard fought competition and ferocious determination this film will certainly inspire you to get off the couch.  After you watch the film you wish you could have all the featured athletes as your friends and realize that your days of athletic endeavor don't need to end.  Fun to watch!",1372896000,,525,4.673913043478261
5774916,5,B00D4VI02C,"When I first saw the message on facebook for the film Age of Champions, there was an immediate connection for me and I ordered the DVD.

Watching this film, I was so inspired by these seasoned athletes who have such great stories to tell and a competitive spirit that is nothing short of contagious. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to bring the film to a larger audience when our congregation decided to launch a healthy lifestyle program the first part of the year.

Holding a screening of the film Age of Champions was a perfect way for us to launch our new program and having both the film's director and producer attend and hold a Q & A session certainly added value. Laughter, tears and applause were all emotions expressed by the audience and everyone in attendance agreed the film was very well-done and many were motivated to make lifestyle changes immediately.

There are so many health benefits to being both physically and socially active and both are on full display in the film Age of Champions  - one of our senior groups will be hosting a viewing party soon and over time we know this film will become a staple in our health ministry program outreach.

Thank you for your exceptional work and all of the good things Age of Champions inspires to bring to the health and well-being of our congregation for many years to come.",1372896000,,1341,4.617647058823529
5774917,5,B00D4VI02C,"This is a marvelous film.  The competitors are truly champions--in life as well as sport.  This is a laugh out loud film, full of interesting people who are living life fully.  At times poignant, always inspiring, it is a must see of people of all ages.",1372896000,,253,4.456521739130435
5774918,5,B00D4VI02C,"I was fortunate enough to see this film a few months ago, and I was deeply moved. It was so inspiring to see so many people late in life so full of energy, optimism and positivity.  It demonstrates without a doubt that we never stop growing and it is always time to set new goals and strive to meet and exceed them.  The film is well-edited and scored, and it left me feeling full of joy (even if it made me feel like I need to really get my act together fitness wise if I'm going to be playing tennis at 100!).  Good job guys! I'll be recommending it to all my friends both young and young at heart!",1372896000,,600,4.025210084033613

8589637,5,B00D4VI02C,MUST watch for all generations. My friend and I couldn't put our pearly whites away the whole time. From the topic selection to how it was all presented. I loved this film so much I shared it with all my 'older' family members to show that 'being' old is only in their head.,1416960000,,274,4.188679245283019

8589639,5,B00D4VI02C,Wonderful movie!!!! First of all you want to be friends with all the athletes and secondly it makes you want to get out there and workout with them.  A definite two thumbs up!!!!,1402185600,,178,4.393939393939394
8589640,5,B00D4VI02C,"This is one of those films that will bring a chuckle, a sense of envy, some pride, and a realization that but there for the grace.....Director Christopher Rufo has captured the special moments as athletes prepare for the 2009 National Senior Games: a 100-year old tennis player from Cape Cod, brothers from Washington, D.C., in their 80s who swim, a Texas widower who finds solace in training, and his rival, an 86-year-old champion in field events intent on the world's record in the pole vault for persons over 80. A women's basketball team from Louisiana is hair-dos and drawls off the court, but tigers on. We watch the athletes train, they talk about why they compete, family members and friends comment. One of the brothers undergoes cancer treatment. Then it's on to San Francisco to go for the gold. It is a fun film, inspiring, and humbling  - all at the same wonderful time.

8589641,4,B00D4VI02C,"We think that there should have been more women competitors highlighted.  Also there wasn't much info on what event categories the participants participated in.  We would have liked to see more events and the participants involved.  Even if the video was longer, it would be fine if more events, participants and highlights were shown.  Good video, but we felt it was too specific.",1395878400,,381,5.0
8589642,5,B00D4VI02C,"This is a movie that should be watched by everyone ,young or old. It's all about people who have continued sport competition well into their later years. Although the people ( all real people) in the movie played these sports when they were younger,and played them well,they continued into their advanced years,all looking to win Championships in one form or another. Although it is not necessary to win such championships,it's the fact that such activities can be continued,long after most think they can,t,that's important..Hobbies and activities are a very important aspect that keeps one involved physically,mentally and socially. We don't all have to partake in strenuous activities such as these. There is no end of the things that people can get involved in all their lives or take up in later years,
How heavily involved really doesn't matter,just as long as the amount of effort you are willing or able to put into it is up to you. I am nearly 79 and have always been involved in hobbies and activities. I curled and bowled for many years. I was an active Rockhound and Birder for years. I loved playing Badminton,Snooker and Pool. I did a lot of traget shooting,play Bridge,did some Art,and a lot of Ice  and Roller Skating and swimming,always loved Nature,and spending time outdoors and enjoying all aspects of nature,;and in all these activities made friends with people of all ages,many much older than myself at the time. I was really never very interested in heavy competition or contact sport,mainly because I always preferred to ""make peace than war"". Some people tend to stick with one activity exclusively and become very good at it;l,but I always seemed to move on after a while. About 25 years ago ,I started Birding,and for years did almost nothing else. I travelled all over North America,met many excellent Birders,and made many friends. I belonged to several clubs and organizations and took on several offices with them. In the last several years,I've become a voracious reader,have built up a large library,and love writing Reviews. I have also gone back to the interest I had in Puzzles (see my Reviews) when Iwas in my youth,and spend a lot of time looking for,solving and even becoming friends with others with a similar interests.
 The point of all this is, that having interests in any kind of sports.hobbies activities etc,give one an opportunity to meet people with similar inters ,something to get up for each day,and no doubt makes life a whole lot more interesting and rewarding. Whether it is one thing or many,the choice is yours.
 The only problem I have is there's never enough time in the day to do everything I want to do. I feel I could quit everything I'm involved in,and in no time could find lots of other activities to occupy myself. I always thought I'd like to read up on the history of Lighthouses,travel and visit and draw or paint them. I( can only imagine the things I'd see and the people I'd meet. If not that,there are hundreds of others. I had a friend in San Diego,who I met through writing Reviews. She had been a model,a dancer,and led a very interesting life as thje wife of a Navy Pilot;and at 80 decided to, and did write several novels. All at the same time she decided to visit the capital of each US State. She finally completed her goal a year or so befor dying when she visited Juneau,Alaska with her 16 year old Grandaughter.
 I bet everyone in the movie feels the same about life.",1390348800,,3451,4.756260434056761

8589644,4,B00D4VI02C,"A documentary everyone should see...the senior ""champions"" all had a few attributes in common...sense of humor and a positive attitude...both needed for a long and happy life...all ages should enjoy..",1385337600,,200,5.7
