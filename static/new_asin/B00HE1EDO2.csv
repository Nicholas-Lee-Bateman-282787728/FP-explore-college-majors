6155758,3,B00HE1EDO2,"Sometimes, when you have such a dramatic high, the world expects too much of you to the point where nothing you put out, even the good stuff, is met with this glance of disapproval and disappointment because it just isn't what everyone expected.  Lofty expectations can be a killer, to both the audience and the filmmaker.  A lot was made of Asghar Farhadis follow-up to the sensational Oscar winner, A Separation.  I know that it was high on my must see list, and everything about the film, including the mystery surrounding the plot, had me all in.

I couldn't wait for this!

Sadly, I missed this in the theater (or is it a sad thing?) and so I had to wait for the DVD to drop, but once it did I snatched it up and settled in the other night to take in what I expected to be sheer greatness.

I was left scratching my head a bit, completely disappointed in this film and wondering if it was because I expected too much or because the film just simply isn't very good.

Ive settled on the later.

Heres my deal; where much of A Separation felt shrouded in this mystery that served a greater purpose and left us with a resolve that felt so grounded in a realism made identifiable (and lasting), The Past just feels mysterious for the sake of giving us something to try and pay attention to, and when all is revealed were left with an emptiness, simply because the mystery becomes anticlimactic and unrewarding.  It doesnt help that the conclusion feels so abrupt and untruthful, and this has a lot to do with the fact that the film spends two hours doing practically nothing, when it should have been developing these characters.

When all is said and done, everyone feels so one-dimensional.

The film tells the story of a couple finalizing their divorce.  In the wake of this, the wife, Marie, has taken up with a married man, Samir, whose wife has attempted suicide and lies in the hospital in a coma.  Marie exchanges men every few years, and so she has two daughters from two different men (neither of which is her husband, Ahmad, or her current lover) and because of this her eldest daughter, Lucie, resents her and causes her grief by staying out all night and bickering with her.  Lucie is also harboring a secret, but I won't touch that.  The lives of these four people are interwoven and ultimately come crashing into one another when Ahmad takes it upon himself to uncover secrets and fix problems and then abruptly wash his hands of it all and leave.

Thanks for that.

The real issue is that nothing feels developed past a concept.  Like, Marie hops around but why?  Nothing is really explored and so she becomes a very despicable woman and a selfish one at that, and yet I think there is supposed to be something deeper here.  Samir is basically a soulless cypher who causes trouble with his appearance but really has no deeper purpose.  We don't get to know him outside of a few tiffs he has with Marie and so his character becomes a forgettable one, to the point where his final decisions feel weakly inserted into the film.  Ahmad and Lucie get a little more development, and Pauline Burlet (who looks just like Marion Cotillard) delivers a very sincere and honest performance, but her arc was just so unmoving.  I didn't really care, and I needed to care for it to make any sort of impact.

Like, I waited this longfor this?

And the constant back and forth of is she lying/is there more/one more secret/someone else is lying/oh you're telling the truth was redundant and took away from the storytelling.

But the acting was solid, if a bit stagnant in parts (and Bejo was uniformly unremarkable and didn't deserve that Cannes Award at all), but the kids clearly outshined the adults in every way.  I find it fascinating to know that Cotillard was initially cast as Marie (makes perfect sense considering Burlet played the daughter) and I wonder how much better the film would have been had she been cast, but then again, the real issues here were in the script and so Im glad she didn't tarnish her increasingly remarkable resume with this film.",1397088000,2,4065,4.555708390646492

6155760,5,B00HE1EDO2,"""Le Pass"" (English captions) was nominated for numerous awards and honors throughout the world last year (2013). Let me add, they are all richly deserved!

Written and directed by Iranian Asghar Farhadi (""A Separation""), this contains his signature style: deliberate action, authentic production design, realistic dialogue and down-to-earth relationships, plus a complex plot that requires your full attention.

We watch:
  * Brnice Bejo (""The Artist"") is Marie, a remarried divorce with two children who is filing again in order to marry a third man.
  * Ali Mosaffa (""The Last Step"") is Ahmad, the fellow she is divorcing. He has come from Tehran to sign the papers and to see her again. He also wants to see her two daughters because they were fond of one another.
  * Tahar Rahim (""A Prophet"") is Samir, the fellow she wants to marry.
  * Elyes Aguis in his first role, plays Fouad, the little boy who will join Marie's family when she marries his father. This child is stunningly well directed: his rage, defiance, grief and confusion are authentic in every way!
  * Pauline Burlet (""La Vie en Rose"") is Marie's elder daughter Lucie, who has a shocking secret.

As each subsequent layer of plot was peeled away, the movie became more involving. The final scene left me gasping; anything I disclose would probably be a Spoiler, so just trust me when I say, ""Check out this film!"" I am preordering mine from Amazon.",1396742400,,1418,4.858333333333333
6155761,5,B00HE1EDO2,"Iranian writer/director Asghar Farhadi has hit the mark again with THE PAST - a film equal to if not superior to his Oscar winning A SEPARATION. Why this brilliant movie was not nominated for an Oscar is a serious conundrum. Farhadi demonstrates further that his ability to dissect family interactions and question ethical behavior among his characters is unmatched.

Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa), an Iranian man deserted his French wife and her two children to return to his homeland, returns to Paris four years later at his wife's request: his wife Marie (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo) is in a new relationship with an Arab man, the dry cleaners' owner Samir (Tahar Rahim), a reality her husband confronts upon his wife's request for a divorce. Coming back to accomplish the divorce procedure, Ahmad arrives in Paris to meet his ex-wife and her daughters - 16 year old Lucie (Pauline Burlet) and the very young L&eacute;a (Jeanne Jestin) from her previous marriage - only to discover that Lucie has defensive behavior and resents the fact that Samir and his young son Fouad (Elyes Aguis) are living in her home. Marie pleads with Ahmad to speak with Lucie to assess and correct her bizarre behavior (both of Marie's children relate well to the warmly tender and understanding Ahmad, despite his unexpected absence form their family for four years). Ahmad discovers that Samir is still married - his wife is in a coma for the past eight months due to a suicide attempt - and Lucie's behavior, superficially because she blames Marie's and Samir's affair as the cause of Samir's wife's suicide, makes living in the same house with Marie and Samir intolerable. The interaction between Ahmad and Marie, Ahmad and Samir, and Ahmad and the three children gradually discloses the mystery behind Samir's reason for suicide - an exploration that includes confrontation with Samir's faithful illegal employee Nama (Sabrina Ouazani) and a secret Lucie has been stifling. The manner in which Marie relates to her former husband Ahmad, her fianc&eacute; Samir (by whom she is pregnant) and the unresolved question of whether Samir's wife will remain in a coma or awaken drives this story to an end that is for the most part left up to the viewer to decide.

The entire cast is excellent, the cinematography by Mahmoud Kalari, the musical score by Evgueni and Youli Galperine and the writing and direction by Farhadi are exemplary. This is a tough ultimately brilliant work that deserves a very wide audience. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, March 14",1395878400,9,2528,5.016666666666667
6155762,4,B00HE1EDO2,"""The Past"" (2013 release from France; 130 min.) brings the story of Ahmad and Marie. As the movie opens, Marie is picking up Ahmad at the airport. We soon learn that Ahmad is visiting Paris from Tehran to finalize their divorce (at Marie's behest as she wants to remarry). Almost immediately they start arguing about minute details. Marie is letting Ahmad stay at her house in suburban Paris. Marie's two daughters from a prior relationship, young Lea and 16 yr. old Lucie, are happy to see Ahmad again, as it's been 4 years since he and Marie broke up. Lucie is having a very difficult time with her mom Marie, who is in a relationship with Samir, a drycleaner owner whose wife is in a coma and who has a young son. About 45 min. into the movie, Marie and Ahmad meet with the judge who pronounces them officially divorced. What will become of Marie and Ahmed? Will Marie marry Samir? Can Marie and Lucie patch over their difference? And how did Samir's wife actually get onto a coma? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from writer-director Asghar Farhadi, whose previous film, 2011's ""A Separation"" was fantastic (and won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film). ""The Past"", while very different in details and tone, is nevertheless in the same vein as ""A Separation"", as both movies document a powerful family and relationship drama. Second, it's not clear whether tit was the director's intent, but the movie shows the problems that can come from ""mixed families"", as in: kids from multiple relationship, have a hard time and are never the winners in these relationship dramas. The conflict between Marie and her oldest daughter Lucie is in particular complex yet also compelling to watch (I don't want to go into too many details). Towards the end of the movie, Marie confesses that she desperately wants to move on with her life and leave the past behind, ""but what if we can't forget it?"", she laments... Third, there are plenty of stellar acting performances, none more so than B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo as Marie (She won Best Actress at Cannes 2013, where this movie premiered), but Tahar Rahim as Samir and Ali Mosaffa as Ahmad are also outstanding. And what about Pauline Burlet as the troubled 16 yr. old Lucie! Kudos to all of them. What a refreshing movie this is! People having, you know, adult conversations that engage you. What a concept, right? This movie shows once again that you don't need the world blown up to smithereens every 5 minutes to create a powerful and entertaining movie.

Ever since this premiered at last year's Cannes festival, to much acclaim and buzz, I had been looking forward to seeing this movie. It finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I went to see it right away. The late matinee screening I saw this at was not well attended, although that is probably more a reflection of the terrible winter weather than it is of the quality of this movie. Iran submitted this movie in the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Movie category, Given than less than 1% (give or take) of the movie is spoken in Farsi, and the remaining 99% in French, I am not surprised that ""The Past"" did not get nominated. But that doesn't make it any less of a movie. If you are looking for a top notch quality foreign, conversation-driven movie, you cannot go wrong with this. ""The Past"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1392336000,18,3501,4.700325732899023
6155763,4,B00HE1EDO2,"This Golden Globe nominee was sadly ignored as an Oscar contender. Iranian director Asghar Farhadi directs this complex, multi-layered production with sensitivity and insight, which deserves a nod. Berenice Bejo won Best Actress at Cannes.

Ahmad (Ali Moutaffa) returns to Paris from Iran to finalize his divorce from Marie (Berenice Bejo), who is in a relationship with another Iranian man, Samir (Tahar Rahim). Ahmad is fond of Marie's daughters from a previous marriage, particularly Lucie (Pauline Burlet) the older daughter. He has an easy way with children generally, trying to connect with Samir's troubled son Fouad (Elyes Aguis), who lives with them. Lea (Jeanne Jestin), the younger daughter's character is peripheral.

Ahmad quickly becomes embroiled in Marie's dysfunctional domestic dynamic, coerced into acting as mediator between mother and daughter. Lucie does not approve of Marie's relationship with Samir (no spoilers here) and starts to act out.

Marie is not really concerned for her children - she comes first. It is apparent that while none of the children are Ahmad's, he is by far the better parent. Marie's request for Ahmed to be present for the divorce to be finalized is a thinly veiled appeal for assistance, as her life unravels.

However, Marie's apparent feistiness belies a deep vulnerability. The two gentle men in her life are stronger by far than she is. She is the perfect foil for them to prove their worth, but we feel for her too, even though she is initially unlikeable.

The ending is somewhat unresolved - it is up to the viewer to decide.

Asghar Farhadi's expert touch and impressive resume (A Separation won  Best Foreign Language Film at the 2012 Academy Awards) make this movie memorable.",1390348800,5,1737,5.138297872340425
6155764,4,B00HE1EDO2,"I was absolutely stunned that the Academy overlooked this remarkable film as a potential best foreign language film of 2013. The Past is not as compelling as Farhadi's previous film, A Separation, yet it offers the same layers of emotional complexity which exist in most of his films. It is fascinating how the focus of the main plot diverts into an intriguing and much subtle subplot... The story unfolds when an Iranian husband returns to France to divorce his French wife who is to marry another Middle Eastern man. The estranged couple seem trouble free finalizing their separation, however, things soon prove to be profoundly complex and challenging for the characters to overcome...  Superb performances by all, especially by the younger characters and the kids, something that Farhadi has proven to be masterful at...

The film can be treated as an incredibly sophisticated whodunit, as Ahmad tries to discover why Lucie hates her mother, and becomes involved in a web of intrigue that focuses on why Samir's wife Cline (Aleksandra Klebanska) ended up in a coma.  Everyone tells their version of the truth, but they do not explain everything.  The action offers a series of revelations that not only tell us what happened, but why it happened: everyone, it seems, was jealous of everyone else in a love-quartet involving Marie Brisson, Cline, Lucie, and Samir, as well as illegal worker Naima (Sabrina Ouazani), who becomes unwittingly drawn into the action.

Yet director Farhadi is much more interested in his characters' state of mind.  As in his earlier work such as A SEPARATION and ABOUT ELLY, he makes considerable use of interior shots of the characters driving their cars; this not only suggests a kind of insulation (both mental as well as physical) from the outside world, but also a continual restlessness, an unwillingness (or is it inability) to face up to themselves.  This is especially true in LE PASS, where Marie Brisson and Samir plan to get married, with little concern for the effect that it might have on their children.

As the action unfolds, so it becomes clear that every single character is imprisoned by their respective pasts.  However much they might try to escape - by marriage, or moving to another country, or simply running away (like Lucie) - they will always have to face the day of reckoning.  Whether they are able to negotiate this process is another story. They would rather pursue lives of continual action: work, household chores, eating out.

But Farhadi will not let his characters off the hook so easily; his camera focuses on their expressions in almost forensic detail - making us understand the mental and physical strain they experience.  LE PASS is an incredibly intense experience to watch; there is no music to alleviate the tension, and the camera refuses to give us any relaxation - through panning shots, or lengthy tracking shots.  Instead Farhadi makes continual use of the close-up and two-shot, forcing us to consider the characters' behavior and relate it to our own lives. What would we do if we were faced with Ahmad's or Lucie's dilemmas?

The film comes to some kind of resolution in the end, but still no real questions concerning the protagonists' lives have been answered.  Many of them are doomed to lives of perpetual loneliness through their inability to communicate either emotionally or literally.

As a fan of 2011's Oscar winning foreign language film, ""A Separation,"" I was eager to see director Asghar Farhadi's follow-up. Like his previous film, ""The Past (Le pass)"" deals with family matters of a similar nature.

Set in a non-descript section of Paris, Iranian national Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa) is returning from Tehran after 4 years to sign divorce papers with his estranged wife Marie (Berenice Bejo). Surprisingly she has offered him accommodations at her (and his former) house rather than get a hotel. Their reunion restarts squabbles and bickering that remind each of why their marriage fell apart.

Although they never had children together, Ahmad was stepfather to Lucie (Pauline Burlet), now 16 and defiant of her mother. There is also a younger sister of about 8. A young boy of about 9 named Fouad (Elyes Aguis) is also living there. He is the son of an Arab named Samir (Tahar Rahim) and both are currently living with Marie. This arrangement and Ahmad's invite certainly seems a bit awkward at best, but Ahmad goes along with it. Especially after Marie asks him to find out what is bothering Lucie. Why she stays out until late at night, skips school and rebels against Marie?

Complicating matters further, Samir is still married. But his wife is in a coma as the result of a suicide attempt. The why is the central theme of the film. But this is more than a boilerplate drama. There is tension and more than a little bit of mystery as the film plays out. As Ahmad says several times during the movie, it's all a misunderstanding.

For me, the story is more about the children than it is about the adults. Their actions have serious ramifications on the kids and Farhadi isn't shy about exposing that element. The kids aren't there just because they are part of the family; they have their own personalities and crosses to bear. Shot frequently with hand held cameras, the photography feels at times like we're watching a documentary and I think that is the idea. The film runs a tad long, but is certainly a compelling film. The actors are truly excellent and that includes some remarkable performances from the younger ones. See it.

The Blu ray transfer is as good as the film.  Using a 1.85:1 aspect ratio and video resolution of 1080p, the look is perfect.  It was a bit startling to see the life like colors, the fine detail, the exquisite clarity and sharpness of the surroundings.  Facial tone is excellent.  This is a Blu ray showpiece.  Likewise the excellent DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is superb.  This is an immersive French language film (English and English SDH subtitles) and couldn't be better.  The surrounds are in play much of the time but not so that they are noticeable.  Traffic, city sounds, etc. are excellent regardless of the setting.  Extras include a commentary track by the director, a ""making of"" short, a Q & A session with Farhadi, a trailer and some previews from Sony.",1403136000,,2940,4.726027397260274
6155813,4,B00HE1EDO2,"When I see a movie which is around 2 hours long it makes me wince, for like reading a book which is 400+ pages it isn't the length that necessarily scares me, but the issue is whether it can really keep my attention. After all, with being accustomed to 90 minute films, which usually have a slew of issues just within that time frame, imagine 2+ hours. But, when it comes to The Past, the question is whether the film is an exception or shows why editing a film to be around 90 minutes is the unofficial rule or standard.

Characters & Story

Flying in from Iran is Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa) who has come to France in order to finalize his divorce from Marie (Berenice Bejo) who he has a rather complicated relationship with. You see, he left her four years ago and in a way he didn't just leave her, but also her two children from a previous relationship who he seemingly was a father figure to. Something which Marie takes advantage of because her eldest Lucie (Pauline Burlet) has been acting strange lately. She has been staying out till 11, seems to never want to be home, and we learn the main reason has to deal with Samir (Tahar Rahim), her mom's new boyfriend.

And over the course of the movie we learn about the complexity of Marie and Samir's relationship which affects her two kids; Samir's son and wife; as well as someone who helps him at his dry cleaners. Making for what is a drama genre film, but with a slight edge of mystery to it, though without a thriller element.

Praise

It is rather hard to put into words where to exactly begin with praise, so we'll talk about the story first. The film gives life to the complex issue of moving on from a past lover without making it overdramatic with things thrown, ""You left me!"" and all the fodder usually written into scripts to try to put an exclamation point on everything. This was an odd choice to me because with the film being two hours you expect that sort of drama, but instead it seems to try to craft a story in which mostly everyone has a cool head, though of course jealousy, among other emotions, flares things up every once in a while. With this, it makes those rare moments of when everyone isn't trying to keep their composure mean something, and makes each seemingly carefully chosen word noteworthy, for while there is no murder mystery or anything like that, the characters' human nature show why they make the decisions they do.

For example, why did Marie not book a hotel for Ahmad and instead invited him to the home she just started sharing with Samir? Was it to see him close and intimate one more time? Show the life she made for herself without him? Or simply after him not showing up the first time she didn't want to waste her time and money? Then there are a multitude of questions in regards to Samir and Marie's relationship, as well as the effect it has on their kids. Samir's son is only around 10 and is dealing with his biological mother in a coma, and this would be surrogate who was around before his mom attempted suicide. Then, with Lucie, you have a girl who for reasons revealed, can't seem to stand to be in the same room as Samir. Leading you naturally to think the worse and arguably Burlet fends well for herself amongst the adults, even while her acting talent may not be on their level, or the script isn't tailored to utilize her strengths. But, considering she is the catalyst for everything, I would definitely consider her to be casted well.

And in general each actor does their part well. The chemistry between both Marie and Ahmad, as well as Samir and Marie, creates this sort of desire to see either man worthy of her. But with time you evolve past the whole #team nonsense and learn how intricate of a relationship she has with Samir, and how trying her relationship with Ahmad must have been. Showing that while 2 hours is a long period of time, writer/ director Asghar Farhadi seemingly planned to use each and every minute to tell a full-fledged, and complicated, story.

Criticism

I will say though, without any character having a flare for dramatics, I did have to pause the film sometimes because I did get a little bored. If just because the whole Lucie situation, which is the heart of the story, felt like it was dragged on too long. Which isn't to say it isn't worth it in the end, but as you watch you may check how far into the film you are to see if the big reveal(s) will happen anytime soon.

Overall: Worth Seeing

If you have the patience, and the time, I think this is definitely worth seeing. The portrayals seek to not overdramatize a situation, no matter how dramatic it would be if you were to read them on paper, and with this you get a sense that the idea here is to show humanity and not put on a performance. Add in a very intriguing story dealing with infidelity, stability, guilt, love, and how these things interact, and you get a rather good two hour film which may test your attention at times, but I feel it is worth it.",1402876800,,4970,4.414847161572053

6155826,4,B00HE1EDO2,"A French-Italian-Iranian drama The Past (Le Pass) is written and directed by Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, Oscar winner for his A Separation.

His new film starts out with one symbolic scene at an airport (check out the glass wall). An Iranian Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa) has just arrived in France to finalize the divorce procedure with his estranged wife Marie (Brnice Bejo). They have been separated for four years, and for Ahmad, who revisits his old house in Paris suburb, four years is long enough. So many things have changed.

But he soon realizes something else. Everyone here seems having hard time. The relationship between Marie and her older daughter Lucie (Pauline Burlet) is unusually strained, as Lucie hates Maries boyfriend Samir (Tahar Rahim). And a quiet man Samir always looks very sad. What happened after Ahmad left for Teheran four years ago?

Compared with the directors previous films, it must be said, the films result may be rather underwhelming to some. The story about the mystery keeps us guessing, but it lacks resonance, or the emotional impact that Oscar-winning A Separation has brought so naturally.

Still it is true that Asghar Farhadi is one of the most gifted storytellers in cinema world, giving us rich details about characters and their multi-layered stories of their past. Maybe this is not as great as A Separation, but still is good.",1401667200,,1374,5.0131578947368425
6155827,3,B00HE1EDO2,"I read a bunch of reviews that touted this movie as THE foreign film of the year. Not so. The performances are good and the story line is decent, but it is a little self-aware for my taste. Furthermore, the drama is self-created: sad, but not tragic.",1400630400,,250,4.340425531914893

6155829,5,B00HE1EDO2,"Asghar Farhadis films deftly peel away the layers of their characters and the complex moral conflicts he establishes. Like A Separation, The Past meanders around a central conflict, exploring each persons unique perspective, and in this case suffering, to establish complete understanding. As is now expected of Farhadi, each portrait is fully realized. A handful of times I couldn't hold back tears, as Farhadi slowly pulled back the curtain. Like one rarely does at the cinema, I felt the full depth of characters emotions. I felt the character Lucie so strongly that I couldn't stop thinking about her. I couldn't stop caring about her. She represents that rare instance when Im upset that I cant meet a character and know them in real life. However I suppose that's because Farhadis characters aren't characters, they're human beings.

The tragedy of The Past is not that were all different. Its that all human beings are essentially the same, and our inability to see this often causes tremendous pain, whether that be in minor quibbles or death. The Past touched me deeply, and I will never forget it.",1400025600,,1107,4.9837837837837835
6155830,3,B00HE1EDO2,"An Iranian man named Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa) arrives in France to sign the divorce papers to his French former wife, Marie (played by Berenice Bejo, who was lovely as Poppy in The Artist). He is surprised that Marie wants him to stay in her house instead of booking him into a hotel. But he is more surprised when he learns that he will share that house not only with Marie and her three children (from a previous marriage), but also with her current lover, the Arab Amir (Tahar Rahim). Soon Ahmad learns that Marie's elder daughter, Lucie (Pauline Burlet) hates her, blaming her for the attempted suicide of Amir's wife, who is in a coma. Not going to tell more about the plot, but we are less than halfway into the film, and many more shocking revelations will occur.

This is the fourth film by Iranian director Asghar Farhadi that I have seen (after A Separation, About Elly, and Fireworks Wednesday). All his movies have a remarkably similar structure. We have a few people interacting, usually representing different social classes (or cultures and nationalities, as in this film). Then, halfway into the movie something happens that sheds light, as in a psychodrama and after very heated discussions, the dark secrets and lies of the protagonists.

To me, this film, despite its acclaim at the Cannes film festival, is less accomplished than his previous films. One reason I didn't like this film so much is the fact that the protagonist, Marie, is so relentlessly unlikeable. In past movies, all characters have, despite their flaws, a deep humanity. But here Marie is thoroughly unappealing, selfish, self- centered, manipulative, immature, angry. There is nothing likable about her, but we have to share her antics for more than two hours. This is not a criticism of Bejo's acting, since she plays very well a very unsympathetic character.",1399334400,4,1845,4.891373801916933
6155831,5,B00HE1EDO2,"This is all about relationships, and treats them with a depth that adds interest to the film.  It's about moms and daughters, husbands and wives (and exes), fathers and sons, and is woven in a way that it doesn't feel contrived.  It's interesting to contemplate how a person's insertion into others' lives can change the dynamic for a family.  Also, the assumptions one can make that may have no basis in reality, yet can destroy relationships.

The film is set in ""unadorned"" Paris, the acting is lovely, and the subtitles don't feel intrusive.  This film will leave you thinking.

Enjoy!",1398470400,2,589,4.84

6155833,4,B00HE1EDO2,"This film by Iranian director Asghar Farhadi follows his earlier A Separation. Both movies are about 'breakups' between couples. The Past, opens in a Paris airport where Ali Mossafa is met by his wife, Berenice Bejo, who has asked him to return from Teheran where he's been living since leaving her several years earlier. She wants the divorce in order to marry her paramour, Tahar Rahim, who runs a dry-cleaning shop in the Iranian section of Paris. Bejo has two daughters by an earlier marriage and, in an early scene, Mossafa is warmly greeted by his 8 year-old stepdaughter and easily befriends the equally young son of Rahim who is living with his future stepmother though he wants to 'go home' but knows his mother isn't there. The plot thickens when we learn that Rahim's wife had attempted suicide and was now in a coma with a questionable prognosis. We are then introduced to Lucie, Bejo's older daughter now in high school and also living in the crowded house. Lucie wants Mossafa to stop the impending marriage of her mother to Rahim, but he goes ahead and completes the divorce with the intention of immediately returning to Teheran. In the middle of the film we learn that Bejo is pregnant, that Lucie has sent copies of the e-mail love letters between her mother and Rahim to his wife and believes that this caused the wife's suicide attempt, but an alternative cause of the suicide involving a clerk in the dry-clean shop is presented toward the end. Mossafa decides to remain in Paris to help Lucie overcome her felt guilt. Rahim appears to solve the question of which act caused the suicide attempt but the viewer is left with some doubts that he is correct. At the end we find that Rahim really wants his wife to recover, the affair with Bejo was just that- an affair- despite her unintended pregnancy. The doctors suggest  that a response to odors she like would be the best test of her recoverability. Rahim gather all her perfumes and includes one of his which she likes. The doctors test a few with negative results, but not the last. Rahim returns to her hospital bed with the collection, dabs his on his face and wrists and asked her to squeeze his hand if she likes it. The final scene is wordless with his hand in hers. It is left to the viewer to decide whether there is a squeeze- or not.
At a number of points in the plot where new facts emerge, Farhadi asks the viewer to decide what past event was caused by the new finding coupled with the older ones. This is standard mystery genre but Farhadi doesn't ever provide the iron-clad, confirmable, explanation we expect of mysteries; the alternative is always a possibility here. This is ambiguity! If we stop to think about it, there is always a great deal of ambiguity in all of our lives. This is the message of the film.
The acting is superb, especially by Rahim's 8 year-old son, Fouad, who steals the show in his several scenes. The character development of all the principals and sub-principals is also superb. The film is subtitled rather than in english but this didn't bother this viewer.",1397347200,5,3076,4.6234003656307125

""The Past"" shows a far more complex and disturbing family dynamic; Berenice Bejo plays a woman who has two daughters from her first marriage, and is getting a divorce from her second husband so she can take up with her lover, whose wife has been in a coma for the past eight months following an unsuccessful suicide attempt.  There are no elderly grandparents this time; the young parents and children provide enough drama.  Farhadi employs the same claustrophobic framing on display in ""A Separation,"" where the characters are never out in the open, but always boxed in and limited by their immediate surroundings.  The first scene, in which Ali Mosaffa meets Bejo in the airport as he returns from Iran to France to complete their divorce, sets the stage for the rest of the film with the device of placing them on opposite sides of a soundproof glass wall - they can see but can't hear each other.

An exploration of the harm that unhappy people can inflict on each other, and how much responsibility we bear for others' poor choices, the lesson of ""The Past"" may be that if you aren't willing or able to commit to someone for life, maybe you shouldn't have children.",1497657600,,1405,5.226666666666667
