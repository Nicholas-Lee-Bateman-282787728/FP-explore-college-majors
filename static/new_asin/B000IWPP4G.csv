8147607,5,B000IWPP4G,Great video!,1408060800,,12,5.5
8147608,4,B000IWPP4G,"Note that this film is NOT Sender Films' ""First Ascent: The Series"" (2010)

The highly aclaimed 3-DVD, First Ascent: The Series, came out in September 2010 and includes the first ever ropeless climb of Yosemite's sheer 2,000 foot wall of Half Dome; the longest BASE jump achieved, from the infamous Eiger Nordwand; a tragic expedition to the lost peaks of Western China; and more.

The case even looks like this one, but it's not the same.",1284422400,34,439,4.7631578947368425
8147609,5,B000IWPP4G,"One of the best climbing movies I've seen ever. And believe me I've seen a lot! It's personal, it's well paced, have amassing climbers in it, it captures the essence of climbing right there on the spot. Great movie to watch over and over again.",1265932800,,244,4.444444444444445
8147610,5,B000IWPP4G,"Sure there are one or two corny parts, but overall this movie kicks ass. The climbing is intense, and you explore their personalities more than the traditional ""sport documentary"" type of film. Great scenery, excellent climbing, real struggle, a winner of a movie.",1256083200,2,264,5.162790697674419
8147611,4,B000IWPP4G,"First ascent is a film that shows a lot of great climbing. From Dean Potters FA of The Tombstone in Utah to DWS in Thailand and a gripping account of the Cobra Crack's first ascent (8c+). I must also say that a few scenes in the film are a waste of time and are probably included in an attempt to add humour (i.e. ""Human Ape"", an idea to sell a urban climbing concept to Hollywood). In contrast a few other recent climbing films, First Ascent appears ""homemade"" in the sense that sometimes the director cheers for the climbers and comments on the climbing. This does no diminish the quality of the film, rather it makes it more real as if it's just a bunch of friends out climbing together. All in all I recommend this movie - the Cobra Crack account alone is worth the film in it self.",1223164800,6,786,4.281879194630872
8147612,4,B000IWPP4G,"A totally inspiring film for trad climbers. Compelling storyline, nice pace, gets a little slow in the middle (with one not-so-inspiring and one comic sequence), then picks right back up again. What's really cool is also how the director captured the essence of / personallity of the climbers. I have had the good fortune of attending a trad-climbing clinic run by Cedar Wright (one of the featured climbers) at the 07 Petzl Roc Trip and after sharing a car trip with Cedar as well as half a day of his teachings, I feel like he is pretty much the guy you see in this video; he's able to be so much better than the rest of us at this sport yet stay totally approacheable, psyched about his climbing, easy going but sets goals and works hard to get there. On a personal level, after having seen how the climbers in this video commit to moves after having placed their gears, and then not worry about falling and just concentrate on the moves, I have actually improved my mental side through emulation; and sure enough, the added focus just makes for a better climbing experience; net net: worrying less = less falling and therefore I am actually a safer climber than when I fussed more.",1222646400,,1185,4.542056074766355
8147613,5,B000IWPP4G,"anybody who loves rock climbing, this is an amazing film. unbelievable, a must buy.",1168473600,2,83,5.0
