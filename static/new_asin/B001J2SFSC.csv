3650466,5,B001J2SFSC,I found these movies most enjoyable. I highly recommend these to anyone who enjoys motorcycle touring and general riding. The package deal is a big savings.,1233100800,,156,5.038461538461538
3650467,5,B001J2SFSC,"Great entertainment.  Love seeing things about travel that you just don't see on all of the generic travel shows.  It was nice to see real people and real things, instead of a resort that is just like any other.",1233014400,,211,4.384615384615385
3650468,5,B001J2SFSC,Graet DVD set especially if you buy it for $30 on Amazon as the single DVD goes for just as much.,1232668800,,97,3.6666666666666665
3650469,5,B001J2SFSC,"Exhilarating, funny, intelligent, shocking, and raw, Ewan and Charley take us along on their adventure of a lifetime on their BMW R1150 GS Adventure motorcycles. A heartwarming and intimate portrait of two best friends sharing an amazing journey together on the road, it feels like they take you right along with them on their travels. Ewan's constant, infectious laugh and Charley's feisty yet good-natured demeanor and comic facial expressions make them a hilarious and irresistible pair. Every day I looked forward to coming home from work and popping the latest episode into the DVD player to see where their adventure would take them next. From the Ukraine, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan to deep into Siberia on the disturbing Road of Bones (Stalin sent 20 million people to their deaths constructing it), they must traverse dangerous flooded river crossings that threaten to crush their vehicles and turn them back, and become helpless witnesses to a horrific bear poaching perpetrated by the very people who stop to help them, all nauseatingly caught on camera, of which later, Ewan and Charley reveal their true feelings of shock and disgust over the incident. Ewan and Charley have an enthusiasm for living life to fullest that is unmatched and completely addicting. They speak directly to the audience on camera through their diary logs that puts the entire program onto an intimate, personal level. If you enjoy travel programs, are a motorcycle fan, or a fan of Ewan McGregor, this is a highly informative and entertaining documentary of a journey of exploration on personal and geographic levels. I loved every minute and hope they take us on another journey in the near future. Other notables include their work with UNICEF and children's rescue, and adorable animal encounters (don't miss the beard-biting puppy in the DVD extras). And in addition, great music scoring with song clips from Radiohead, Massive Attack, Orbital, Stereophonics, and more.

Their journey through Africa is more tension-filled (recurring problems within the group erupt but are eventually worked through) and serious, but just as entertaining and interesting as Long Way Round on their BMW R1200 GS Adventure motorcycles this time. Perhaps the most difficult and emotional journey of the two, the group visits a primary school in Marsabit, northeast Kenya, where 80 people were massacred, including 20 children in July 2005, and then their shocking visit to a church in Rwanda where 5,000 victims of genocide were slaughtered in one day. Their interaction with local Kenyan farmer families is extraordinary to watch, and the children they encounter are adorable and always so interested in the camera. Their partnership with UNICEF and Riders For Health in Kenya is showcased, demonstrating how medical care and medicine is brought to people who could not access health care otherwise. Also don't miss The Missing Face on the DVD extras, further detailing their efforts with UNICEF and related organizations that give aid to impoverished, abandoned, and abused children and what we can do to help. Another fantastic soundtrack is also included in this adventure (check the Long Way Round site for an episode guide and music credits), which includes artists such as The Boxer Rebellion, Ebb, Ayub Ogada, Geoffrey Oryema, Ben Onono, Afro Celt Sound System, and many more. Thanks Ewan and Charley! I can't wait for you to bring us along on your next motorcycle journey!",1231891200,29,3453,5.199281867145422
3650470,5,B001J2SFSC,"For the motorcycle enthusiasts, this is a very exciting series to watch. I love the fact that this boxed set includes all of their adventures, at such a great price.",1231718400,,165,4.533333333333333
3650471,5,B001J2SFSC,"My family caught only a few episodes of Long Way Around when it first aired and then couldn't find it in the tv listings anymore. We loved it so much and were so disappointed when it wasn't aired in full in our area. Now finally the series has been released on DVD, plus their next show Long Way Down, and a bonus motorcycle show. This show combines two vibrant personalities (one is Ewan McGregor the famous actor), with a long and arduous motorcycle trip through interesting and rarely-seen lands. The people they meet along the way and the adventures they have keep the viewer hooked. Each episode seems to fly by and I'm always bummed out a little when I realize we've neared the end. I'm a 40-something female who was as fascinated by this show as my motorcycle-loving family.",1231459200,,781,4.585714285714285
3650472,5,B001J2SFSC,I watched all of these on the BBC...Always wanted to get the DVDs and when I saw I could buy the box set for what just one of the series went for before it was a no-brainer...Great motorcycling adventure.,1231372800,,204,4.256410256410256
3650473,5,B001J2SFSC,"I had already watched ""The Long Way Round"" a few years ago back in UK and was eager to watch ""The Long Way Down"" as I am originally from Scotland and this adventure was starting in Scotland and ending in South Africa. I had tried to get the DvD from UK before it became available here, but was un-successful. When it did become available, I immediately ordered it. I wasn't dissapointed. I didn't think it was as good as the previous adventure but sequels never seem to live up to the same level as the originals. All in all, I loved seeing the countries Charlie and Ewan visited and I think that it was a very well produced, entertaining video.

Now, ""The Race to Dakar"" was a superb DvD. From start to finish, it was a nail-biting adventure. The riders in the rally deserve medals for putting up with all the hardship associated with the race. I had heard of the race when it was the ""Paris-Dakar"" but never fully understood the endurance required to finish the event. This DvD graphically depicted every day. I would recomend this Box Set to everyone.....Some ""colorful language"" for younger audiences but you could always turn the sound down if you are easily offended!",1231286400,10,1173,4.585714285714285
3650474,5,B001J2SFSC,Too cool for school.  Especially the camera team.  The dudes rule the roads! Live to ride and ride to live.  Be the bike!,1231200000,,121,4.173913043478261
3650475,5,B001J2SFSC,"This is some of the most addicting television ever!!  Motorcycle, Travel & Ewan McGregor lovers would agree that these DVD's rule.",1231200000,2,130,5.190476190476191
3650476,5,B001J2SFSC,What a great series...I wish they would produce a third set.  This series is less about roughing it on an adventure and more about the experiences...It's entertaining.,1390953600,,167,5.185185185185185
3650477,4,B001J2SFSC,"Great Series, and arrived before Christmas
Item was advertised as ""New"" condition however the packaging was damaged.
All discs however were in great condition.  Watched all three over the holidays and not a single CD fault.",1389484800,,223,5.194444444444445
3650478,3,B001J2SFSC,"For the record, this series is wonderful and full of adventure. My husband and I both really enjoyed them.

HOWEVER, as a previous reviewer stated, the seller is sending out unshrink wrapped packaging that is damaged and on of the dvd cases was also broken. As in...there were scattered pieces. I am returning it immediately for a refund.",1379721600,,338,4.827586206896552
3650479,5,B001J2SFSC,"Started watch an episode each night and could not wait until the next. This series is fun, exciting, great scenery and make you realize we are all the same in villages around the world. Charley and Ewan make great travel buddies. I will re-watch again.",1379721600,,252,4.622222222222222
3650480,2,B001J2SFSC,"The DVD and series here is fantastic, but I would not purchase from this seller.  The DVD box set came to me USED!

I paid for a new box set & expected it to come wrapped & new- instead when I opened the package it was not wrapped in plastic, the box was a bit worn & all 8 DVDs just flopped out.

I would NOT have paid nearly $100 for a USED item - had to return it as I could not give it as the gift it was intended to be.  If you are OK with paying full price for a used item, I guess this is an OK seller.",1377820800,,509,3.517857142857143
3650481,5,B001J2SFSC,Great adventure..If you like adventure and a lot of great country. this is the Movie for you...not a Movie for young children...,1375142400,,128,4.863636363636363
3650482,5,B001J2SFSC,This is one of the best motorcycle adventures ever didn't know much about Ewan and Charley but this is great,1370044800,,108,4.45
3650483,5,B001J2SFSC,"Fantastic. Up until they fly to Alaska... Doesn't matter if you ride or not, it's an adventure all can appreciate.",1359936000,,114,4.75
3650484,5,B001J2SFSC,The collection is fantastic.  It is entertaining and funny and touching.  It makes me want to travel the world.  But not on a motorcycle.,1358899200,,137,4.625
3650485,5,B001J2SFSC,"If you love bikes, travel and some comedy.... this is your DVD set to get. What an incredible journey times 2! My wife and I have watched it a few times. Ewan and Charley were great and the countries were stunning. I wish they'd do another trip.",1358380800,,245,4.23404255319149
3650486,5,B001J2SFSC,"I believe this series actually changed my life.  I know, they are stars, they whine too much, and they have a support crew, but to see the cultures in the series as they did, to see the challenges that they faced and overcame, especially the road of bones and their time in Mongolia, it's so worth it.  I think they do a good job showing how unique it can be traveling on motorcycle, whether it's to Ulaanbaatar or down the street, the world is just different, and people view you differently, as well.  I only hope they will do yet another trip...and take me with them!",1356739200,,570,4.3584905660377355
3650487,4,B001J2SFSC,The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is because my editions Race to Dakkar doesn't work in any DVD player I've used. But the other two DVD's are worth the price. Loved bothe of them.,1356652800,,185,4.166666666666667
3650488,4,B001J2SFSC,"Charley and Ewan are a couple of average guys, really, that happen to be actors and are generally recognized figures all around. Through a lot of effort, more than most people can imagine, they hatch a plan to travel around the world on a pair of BMW GS bikes, highly capable ""adventure"" bikes that are made for this type of a ride, and finally set off on this once-in-a-lifetime adventure.

The beginning of their journey is isn't actually riding, but prepping for the ride, and as I can personally attest, prepping is the hardest part of these kinds of adventures. After a lot of work, worry and ""venting"", the guys get on their way, head EAST to New York from England, ""The Long Way Round"".

It's a big adventure, a big undertaking and many people do it on bikes, every year. The difference with their trip over most other trips is the documenting of the trip, the journey really, because that's what it is, starting from nothing with the intention of making this documentary and actually doing it, with the end of the journey being us sitting in front of the TV watching it.

There are a ton of logistics to account for in this type of trip, add to that the filming equipment and supplies, as well as the transport of it all, and you can't forget the group of people behind the scenes supporting the entire effort.

I heard some people say that they do a lot of whining and complaining which they do, and that their bikes and gear and trip was all free, but the truth is, it wasn't. Perhaps they didn't lay out a ton of cash, or rack up credit cards, but they put a huge amount of time and effort into the project. Me, I think it would be easier to go out and simply buy the stuff!

The guys make it, have some tough times as can be expected with an undertaking such as this, and face a lot of culture shock along the way. Sometimes they make remarks that may not seem to be in the best taste, but it also showcases the vast differences in cultural diversity, while at the same time showing that throughout most of the world, we all share the same basic characteristics of love, family, happiness and goodwill.

It's a very good show, Long Way Round is, and I give it 4 stars. I would have given it 5 if it had a bit more of the world outside of their helmets, and if it hadn't been so critical of some of the cultures, but I chalk those up to editing/producing and wanting to show more of the difficult aspects. Charlie and Ewan have a great relationship, tested at times, but aren't all great relationships tested at times?

Remember, this is a commercial, for profit endeavor, and the unfolding dramas reflect that. It's definitely an adventure!

Other recommendations: Search for Globeriders, Helge Pedersen, Sterling Noren, and especially, Gaurav Jani and Dirttrack Productions",1354320000,,2786,4.492094861660079
3650489,3,B001J2SFSC,"Excellent buddy video, Ewan and Charlie on a crazy round-the-world-on-bikes adventure.
However...
We enjoyed the first few episodes but had to stop watching because of the endless swearing.
We're not prudes by any means, but seemingly every five minutes it's the F word, GD, Sh or JC, and it all just got to be too much.

We'll give Long Way Down or Race To Dakar a look over. I'd love my kids to watch at least one of the series.",1352332800,,430,4.375
3650490,5,B001J2SFSC,"Truly a must see! I loved the movies so much the first time, I had to own them. If you're a motorcycle enthusiast and you'd like to get off the beaten track, this series is for you. Friendship, adventure, and beautiful places. Inspiring stories of fantastic feats everyone will enjoy!",1347148800,,284,4.7
3650491,5,B001J2SFSC,"I have a lifelong motorcycle history, my dad and his brother rode motorcycles in the fifties and sixties and so did my former husband. With a new BMW 1000 we went in 1993 to Corsica (for four weeks) and all the way from Northern Germany to the Mediterranean. The BMW was almost too heavy for the trip, so I can easily imagine how hard it must have been for Ewan McGregor and his friend Charley Boorman to handle their BMW's with all the top cases and side cases attached to it.
I think these machines weigh close to 800 pounds plus two human beings...it's very easy to lose the balance.

This trip from London to Russia and then through the US & Canada is a wonderful adventure. They met so many kind and helpful people in all these countries.
Tomorrow I will watch ""Long Way Down"" and am sure it will be as good as the 2004 trip.
Highly recommendable!!!",1344902400,,854,4.3375
3650492,5,B001J2SFSC,"These are such great adventures.  Packed with such interesting places, people, and comedy that you'll find yourself refusing to stop watching till you've seen them all through to the end.",1338940800,,187,5.233333333333333
3650493,5,B001J2SFSC,"FANTASTIC! We didn't want it to end,that's why review title,""LONGER"" Long Way Round,describes how we felt. We have only watched ""LONG WAY ROUND"" so haven't started on the next series of ""LONG Way Down"",but can't wait! Both Ewan and Charlie have such personalities,no acting, just being themselves,that I know we are going to enjoy ALL of the series.",1331510400,,349,5.0344827586206895
3650494,4,B001J2SFSC,"A real adventure worthy to classify this a ""Keeper"" in your collection. It inspires you to follow your dream.  I recommend this for anyone.",1328745600,,139,4.791666666666667
3650495,4,B001J2SFSC,"The raw and truly spontaneous feel of Long Way Round, the humor and the camaraderie that Ewan and Charley obviously have with each other make this series truly unique and utterly enjoyable.  If you like motorcycles, traveling and good humor, this series will delight you.  The Long Way Down series in my view had a lot to live up to since it was the long-anticipated sequel to the original.  Its production value went up from the orignal and the finished series is more polished.  However I think in terms of substance, it falls short of the original series.  It is still entertaining, but I think some of the magic that made me love Long Way Round is missing from this sequel.  Race To Dakar, on the other hand, is a lot of fun to watch because it is very exciting and different.  It gives the viewer a unique inside look at what goes on in this grueling race and what motivates those who are crazy enough to undertake such an adventure.  All in all, the box set provides hours of entertainment and is well worth the money spent.  If you like traveling and/or motorcycling, you will find something to like in every episode.",1328400000,,1124,4.497536945812808

3650497,5,B001J2SFSC,"Maybe I missed it, but it wasn't really explained that this included Long Way Down and Road to Dakar.  That would have been nice to know, because then I wouldn't have ordered Long Way Down separately.  Anyway, this included all three series so that was great.",1325721600,,259,4.608695652173913
3650498,5,B001J2SFSC,"When my motor-cycle riding S.O. said he wanted to watch this DVD of Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman going around the world on BMWs, I could feel the catatonic daze drifting down over my head.  Was I ever wrong.  This is an engaging, charming, funny account of an amazing trip.  Sort of a marriage between a National Geographic Special and Bill and Ted's excellent adventure (only with more interesting characters.)  One warning if you are watching this with kids--the ""f"" bombs really fly, and there is more than a little sophomoric humor from the boys.  Well worth the investment of time and money.",1324166400,,601,4.796116504854369
3650499,4,B001J2SFSC,"If you know the unique feeling of running the roads, or off-roads, on a bike this DVD set is for you. If you love to travel, go places you've never been, love to explore and push the limits, this DVD set is for you. Warning: This triple-bonus set is addictive! Once you put in the first DVD disk, you better plan and prepare to block out some time to sit in front of your television, because you will want to see the next episode.

It's a raw, behind the scenes adventure that makes you feel a part of their personal journey. They put the necessary effort and investment into producing these, so the technical quality is very good. However, beware of excessive profanity throughout. This is unfortunate and unnecessary I feel, because it get's extensive and offensive in some parts, and thereby makes this awesome series not as 'sharable' with younger motorcycle enthusiasts.

I thoroughly enjoyed watching these and will again and again!",1311552000,,938,4.748466257668712
3650500,5,B001J2SFSC,"For those of us who can never ever imagine seeing far away places, this is the DVD set to get.

3650503,5,B001J2SFSC,"I bought this for my hubby for his birthday and he has watched all three, non-stop since. The only bad side effect is that he is now whinging (Ewan's word) about getting out on his bike and riding now. It's great for what it is and it is a rarity. Two guys and a support crew riding motorcycles around the world and doing things that your average Hell's Angel would consider too difficult. One warning to all, it isn't for the faint of heart as there is a lot of cussing and plenty of nudity, as well as pain, bumps, bruises and broken bones, not to mention broken BMWs. The incredible journey through Mongolia and the Road of Bones in Russia are my favorite parts. What a world we live in!",1299456000,,690,4.2748091603053435
3650504,5,B001J2SFSC,"Thank you to Ewan and Charley for having the idea, and letting us go on the adventures with you.  My husband and I loved them all. We are not motorcycle owners, we tend to go with non motorized adventures (Whitewater rafting, biking, snowboarding).  However, the three ""Trips of a lifetime"" that they put together were brilliant!  The guys are outstanding in how they relate to each other and the ""locals"" in all of the areas they visit.  You feel like you want to know them personally, and after watching them in these DVD's you kind of feel like you do.  The highs and lows they go through make the whole experience sublime.  You wanted to be there with them, and experience it all. If you've never traveled or camped out much, you need to see this and see what life is like on the road...around the world.

Regarding regional codes, The seller we purchased from was fantastic, and after a quick e-mail about DVD's and regional code questions, we were ensured that the DVD's would work in the US or we could send them back.  Take a moment to contact the seller it you're concerned, any good seller will stand by their product and ensure you are a satisfied customer.

3650515,5,B001J2SFSC,"The long way around and long way down series are both amazing adventures.  If you're a fan of motorcycling, you will appreciate this so much.  Even if you're not, the trips they take are such massive adventures that it's hard not to be amazed and inspired by them.  Race to Dakar isn't quite the same feel, but certainly conveys the sensation that it is extremely challenging to do this race.  It almost felt like I was exhausted as the riders were at the end of the race.  Plus I have that theme song engrained into my subconscious now.  Not sure that it's a good thing with something that's supposed to be entertaining.  Still a worthwhile watch, but I'd be fine for a slightly cheaper price and the lack of Race to Dakar instead.

I just hope they make long way up sooner than later!",1286582400,,786,4.409722222222222

3650518,5,B001J2SFSC,We had already watched them on Netflix and enjoyed them. I bought the set for a birthday present and he has already watched all of it again. The Race to Dakar was new to us and presented some really grueling action and showed the human sides of people we really like from the previous trips. It is really good Motorcyce action under less than ideal conditions. A good show all around.,1280793600,,384,4.422535211267606
3650519,4,B001J2SFSC,"As a motorcyclist and BMW owner, it was very easy to fall totally into the three adventures portrayed by these DVDs. Most of us only dream about such bike trips and thanks to Charley and Ewen, we're very thoroughly taken along for the ride. Quite frankly, my DVD player got quite the workout once the box set arrived.

That said, a couple aspects of the series could have been better. First on most everyone's list would be the language. With the exception of the KTM rejection and Charley's crash in the Dakar race, the bad language was unnecessary, gratuitous, and only served as conversation fillers as we would use the sounds ""um"" and ""uh"". When I first saw ""Long Way Round"" via Netflix, it was at a friend's house full of kids and the host embarrassingly stopped the show to shoe the youngsters from the room. At least our two protagonists seemed to get the hint during the last half of ""Long Way Down"" which is far more watchable from a parent's standpoint.

The series left the thrill-seeker in me thoroughly happy, but the other shortcoming came purely from my inner motorcyclist.  My biker side had dozens of questions the DVDs just didn't answer: Did they pick their gear because it was the best available or was it because it was free? Were they happy with all the gear they took or did some of it fall short? With support vehicles usually nearby, were their panniers full all the time? Where did they get their fixers and how much did they cost? Have you heard if KTM regrets their decision? Clearly, as a motorcyclist, I would appreciate an extra DVD with some honest answers to these questions, or did you leave them out because the answers would be embarrassing?

Despite these two minor complaints, the box set is truly remarkable and I'm left envisioning their next great adventure. It would start in Inuvik up in the Yukon and end at Rio Gallegos in Patagonia. It would start in the late summer and the incentive for fast pace would be racing against the coming of the snow and closing of the roads. Along the way they would swing by the Victory plant in Iowa and maybe pick up a few tar-balls on the shore of Louisiana. Then we watch our heroes eschew most of the Pan American Highway for lesser known back roads and dirt tracks as they wind their way southward, dodging drug cartels and right-wing militias. I can't wait!

What about it Ewen and Charley? Wanna go for another ride?",1278720000,,2401,4.561484918793504

We watched from beginning to end (all 3 disks) with out missing an episode. And just incase we missed something we started it over. This is completely worth every penny. I highly recommend it.,1277769600,,309,4.344827586206897

Long Way Down was good, but their was a lot more support, and this took a little bit away from it.  Race to Dakar was really good, especially the 1st disc. After I finished watching Long Way Round, I actually could feel their pain and frustrations. I will end up watching this as many times as I have ON Any Sunday.  Very well put together, and tough not to watch all at once.  Thanks Charlie and Ewan!!!!",1277251200,,563,4.072727272727272

more important then the product I would like to give some extra points to the seller (blowitoutahere). In the first set of DVD's I got, 2 out of the 8 discs were bad. I was pissed off but understood that this can always happen. I contacted the seller and they quickly sent me another set of discs and an pre-paid envelop to send back the defective set. no questions asked, no playing around and trying to avoid responsibility (which they could by saying I did something to the discs).

3650527,5,B001J2SFSC,"Regardless if you ride a motorcycle or not the adventures that Ewan and Charley take on both ""The Long Way Round"" & ""The Long Way Down"" are wonderful.  If you do happen to be a two wheel fan you will find these rides simply amazing.

There is enough pre-ride information to give one the feeling of what it takes to undertake experiences such as these.  Both Charley and Ewan have in helmet mics. and cameras so we really do have an idea of what it felt like to actually be on the bike with them.

The landscape they ride through is breathtaking in it's beauty and challenges.  You will be surprised just what a motorcycle can ride through.

I had a real emotional connection with both men and the crew.  I really felt invited along for the ride.

We learn a little about the personal lives of all involved and how being away from home and linked together in this experience offers growth and a lot of laughes.

There is some language that may offend if you are sensitive to that sort of thing.  I did not find it out of context at all, just the natural way these men speak when in the situations they find themselves in.

I highly recommend this box set.  It's an adventure I watch over the winter as my bike sits covered in the garage.",1272240000,,1236,4.303030303030303

3650533,5,B001J2SFSC,"The only fault I have with Long Way Down is that it was too short. I really found myself disappointed when Ewan and Charley rode into South Africa, wishing that their ride could go on. The entire series was inspiring, emotionally uplifting, and simply a great deal of fun. The deep friendship between the two men was wonderful to see and their obvious empathy for the people they encountered on their journey was as real as anything I've ever seen. Seeing Africa unfold through their eyes, in particular their visits to the gorillas in Rwanda as well as the limitless vistas they rode through make me want to see it for myself.

Of the entire series, the one thing that I'll always remember is the scene where the gang is sitting on a deck out somewhere in an African wilderness lodge and Ewan's mom, who was flown in specifically for this, totally catches him by surprise when she walks out to hand him a soft drink. The utter shock and amazement that results is priceless. I must have replayed that scene 5 times.

In all, an amazing travelogue, one I will watch again. I look forward to Charley and Ewan riding from the top of Alaska to Tierra del Fuego next.",1268611200,,1162,4.502369668246446
3650534,5,B001J2SFSC,"Many of the reviews say ""if you ride motorcycles you'll love this."" While this is true, if you don't ride you will still love the adventures. I think what I really enjoyed was the fact that Ewan and Charley never are condescending when faced with cultures and people that many of us would consider ""backward"". They treat everyone with dignity.

If I could rate this higher than the 5 stars allowed, I would.",1268352000,,407,4.575342465753424

On a less positive note, I did not care for the use of swearing in the videos.  It doesn't add, but takes away, from the productions.  Other than that one point I extremely enjoy these videos.

They were great fun and a good value as you get all three series in one package. Warning though, there is a good deal of language that is not appropriate for young children.

3650541,5,B001J2SFSC,"If you have delayed purchase of any of these DVD's for some reason, now it's time to buy.

Obviously a well funded and sponsered effort, but still a great story and I did not find that this took away anything from the story.  I could hardly stop watching them, and lost quite a bit of sleep as I would stay up all night because I wanted to see what happened next.

The first series is probably the most impressive as there were so many unknowns and the relationships had just started.  I read the book for this story, and together they complemented each other very well.  The only sad part was that I will never have a chance to cross Asia as they did, and North America (where I live) appeared to be quite dull in comparison.

The second series was a bit of a struggle as you watch Charley attempt something that is probably a bit over his head.  Being born and raised on Southern California desert, I felt this opportunity was a bit wasted on this particular rider, but the story was honest and riveting and I would love to read a book written by Charlie's co-riders to hear their impression of the event.  OK maybe this was my favorite series.  Charley is such an engaging personality and he may not have the ability of some of his competitors, but just when you think it's hopeless he has bravery to put himself into what appear to be some serious situations.

The third series was great from a humanitarian standpoint, and my family watched more of this one as well.  Not as much motorcycling, even Ewan's wife made a guest riding appearance which made it more travelogue than adventure, but the Africa story is hard to ignore.  Actually of the three, this is the one I will probably watch again first.  Also if I had to suggest another ride for Ewan and Charlie, I would say do Africa again and take 25 of your closest (and well funded) friends and get this story out to as many people as possible.  Sure the bike is a great enabler, but this was about so much more than riding.

Can't wait for the next Ride!",1266192000,,2015,4.3646112600536195

The Long Way Down was a bit more scripted and had tons of product placement; so the originality of the first show; the spontaneity of the characters as more interesting. We felt like the second DVD was almost too polished; the first show showed Charlie and Ewan overcoming adversity, language barrieres etc. The second was a bit of a let down. I guess overall the set is worth the money. I bought it as a gift for my husband's birthday. He was really excited when he got it. That in itself was worth it.

Very long DVDs so we would watch the different chapters throughout the few weeks it took us to watch.

3650550,5,B001J2SFSC,"I had seen ""Long Way Down"" in the theater last year and I absolutely loved it. It is a mix of personal video diary and documentary, and the story of two friends who ride their motorcycles from the top of Scotland to the tip of South Africa, including footage of their rides, the landscapes, some of the sights, the various encounters with people in the countries they traveled, and their experiences. I had been contemplating buying a BMW motorcycle, albeit a different model, but after watching this film became a fan of the R1200GS bikes that were ridden and a few months later went and bought one.

The film is inspiring in that it makes you want to go out and do something similar. Having seen ""Long Way Down"" I knew I wanted to see ""Long Way Round"", which is the first film or documentary of their first trip together. It did not disappoint either. Both are well produced and it is difficult to not want to watch all the DVDs back-to-back. Rounding out the DVD Box set is the Race To Dakar, also done in the same way, this time it is just Charlie Boorman and his part in the famous race to Dakar. All three movies are incredible - fun to watch and it gets you wanting an adventure of your own going.

The price is absolutely great and I haven't seen it anywhere for less. I don't know if it would work overseas, but here in the U.S. it works just fine. I think it is a must have for any person interested in motorcycles, travel, friendship and adventure.",1261958400,,1459,4.360294117647059

Some time had passed since my original purchase of Long Way Round and the team of Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman had gone on two more motorcycle adventures. They now sell a box set conisting of three different motorcycle trips. All three are awesome movies to watch. Even though Mcgregor and Boorman seem to have the money to take these trips, it moves you to think about seeking out your own adventure and living life. P.S.

3650555,5,B001J2SFSC,"My wife and I are addicted to this collection! We have watched the Long Way Round three times now, and it inspired me to get my motorcycle license this summer. Great viewing!

We prefer Long Way Round over Race to Dakar and Long Way Down. Race to Dakar is very tense to watch - I spent the whole time feeling bad for Charley. He's a tough guy and I admire him for giving it a shot, but I felt that his team mate was really cold and not supportive. Long Way Down was great, but their schedule was too rushed and Ewan decided it would be a good idea to bring his wife along at one stage. Both of these factors made this series tense and awkward at points.

Ewan seems like a great husband and father, but (and I don't mean this in a sexist way) he really should have left his wife at home and maybe taken her on a motorcycle tour in his own private time. Clearly no one else on the team wanted her to come. It destroyed the pace and team spirit of the series and I really hope she doesn't make a return in future episodes. I felt bad for poor Charley as Ewan was a bit selfish in this series. He also has a really obnoxious haircut in Long Way Down, which probably bugged me from the start.

Nonetheless, the whole collection is great and I really enjoyed watching Ewan & Charley explore the globe. They are great characters, funny, humble (most of the time), and very candid. It is particularly inspiring to see Ewan work his way through some very challenging riding - well outside his comfort zone - and to see how Charley (a far superior rider) supports and motivates him. Sure he is annoying at times (when he plays with his hair), but he is tough, and did something most celebrities would never have the guts or desire to do.

Warning: you will want to ride a motorcycle after watching these series.

Only disappointments: the extras are weak, and Claudio has much less screen time in Long Way Down. I wish the extras provided a detailed segment dedicated to the actual bikes.",1258502400,,1979,4.309139784946237

You don't have to be a motorcyclist to appreciate the endeavors of this crew. The view of how other cultures live is at times eye opening. I intend to buy more of this set to give as gifts.

3650571,2,B001J2SFSC,"I live overseas and due to unreliable TV service I was only able to catch an episode now and again on either Long Way Around or Long Way Down.  I got hooked on the series after reading ""Jupiter's Travels"" and while the book is a good read, there are gaps so it's difficult to follow how he gets from one place to the other.  I enjoyed the EwanMcGregor and Charley Boorman series or at least the two where they are together.  While I got tired of hearing how hard it was or I miss my family, the entertainment came from the challenges they faced and the places they visited.  As for being hard and tough - thus the reason for their complaints I can't see it.  They had GREAT bikes, tons of gear and a support crew.  So well stocked and supplied I think I saw only one repair made on the road.  This isn't a negative, just saying when you come well stocked and supported it's hard to fail.  They didn't rough it in the bush much, enjoying the comforts of a hotel most nights.  But all in all I have no regrets purchasing the set.

I do however take offense to the third DVD, Race to Dakar.  Shortly into the DVD, during one of the first diary cams Charley's attitude suggests he is already defeated.  He is complaining that now he has to put up since his mouth has gotten him into this mess.  My gut told me this wasn't going to have a nice outcome and when Charley failed to finish any of his training races and chose instead to rush off to the doctor any chance he got, it said it all.  He was looking for an excuse to quit.
The debate a few evenings before the kick off of the race between Charley and his fellow riders on who was in charge was sheer stupidity.  I got through episode 4 before quitting and have to say, the only good point was the comments made by the British rider the trio kept bumping into.  Interestingly, he never complained.  Nor the two who were supporting themselves or the lady who has tried the race 6 times.  The only one complaining relentlessly is Charley and it was HIS IDEA.  He complains about the dust, the rocks, the dunes...DUDE, it's the RACE TO DAKAR.  What did you think you were getting into.  He even flew out and observed the conditions.
As for the sheer nonsense on the BMW SUV.  Complicated things but the training the drivers went through was silly.  They should have been learning how to drive cross country, difficult terrain, negotiating obstacles, and making on the spot repairs.  As in one of the early DVDs, their mishap occurred when they were SPEEDING across the desert.  A bit of caution and the vehicle makes it.  Guess if they were true adventurers and knew that if they broke it they would be stranded perhaps they would have used a bit more common sense.
I would have rated this set 5 stars had the Race to Dakar not been in the set.",1248652800,6,2792,4.300766283524904

What's different is the story and the places Charley and Ewan visit along the way.  They travel roads not visited by the travel station channels.  No tourist traps.  It's really a look and the real world and how the landscape and people change from country to country.  One thing that is really noticed is how 99.99% of the people in the world are welcoming these adventurers.  Invite them into their home, hut and offer them food, and drink how simple or lavish.
A very professional done series, two mates you can really relate to, pushing themselves out of their element.  Charlie and Ewan are prefect traveling companions and keep the series light hearted.

3650600,5,B001J2SFSC,"I am a motorcycle enthusiast 100% all of the time. Not only do I own several bikes, I try to travel vast distances several times per year. This collection of movies from Charlie Boorman and Ewan McGregor are all absolutely superb.

This set I am reviewing contains all three of their travel episodes, including Long Way Round, Race to Dakar and Long Way Down. Although I had previously bought just Long Way Down, it turned out to be in PAL format which in turn required me to purchase a new DVD player capable of playing all formats. Since then I have upgraded to a Blu-Ray player and since this set was such an amazing deal on Amazon, I had to purchase the entire set in one package.

First off, what makes this series so interesting are the total real-life (no acting) scenarios these two great friends undertake together. Along with their superb hand-picked support team, my eyes were glued to the screen every second. Everything from the miserable conditions to the stunning beautiful scenery, Ewan & Charlie push on relentlessly to complete their mission of traveling around the globe in Long Way Round and from Scotland to the tip of South Africa in Long Way Down. The people they encounter, the different town, cities and villages are so interesting.

Because of my interest in motorcycling and my jealously that I have never even come close to such an adventure as these, makes me rate this series right at the top of my list of all-time favorite movies (documentaries) I have ever watched. Watching the motorcycles take such a beating, the horrible road conditions while maintaining that perfect friendship just makes the watching so much more entertaining.

My wife (who doesn't care much at all for motorcycles or riding) also loved the series. She too watched every episode with me and commented on how much she enjoyed the series.

I enjoyed both ""Long Way Down"" and ""Long Way Round"" so extensively, I cannot make a choice between the two as to which is my favorite.

""Road to Dakar"" which is about Charlie Boorman's adventure riding the world's most difficult race. Not only is the race itself entertaining, but all of the preparation required to undertake such a race is enormous. The Race to Dakar was different from the other two, mostly because it focused much more on the hardships Charlie Boorman went through, which showed a real humanistic side of him you did not see in the other two films.

Just remember, these films contain no acting. Its all real-life situations, from the travels themselves, to the people and animal encounters, the broken motorcycles and the injuries sustained, to the bond between these two friends and their elite team of support personnel, it is all real.

If you enjoy motorcycles or motorcycling, you must buy this set and prepare yourself for several days of envious adventurers to unfold before your eyes. Once you've watched them, you will feel as though you've known each of the participants personally for years and on a first name basis. And lastly, I want to point out that without the help and assistance of the support team that trailed along with them and the ladies that prearranged their Visas and documents, none of these adventurers could have been successful. Only with a completely joint effort, these films were possible.

On the other hand I think Mr. Mc Gregor and Mr. Borman could have chosen a selfish approach, or just make the travel for the sake of motorcycling and keep all their experiences for themselves. In my case, thanks for sharing such a wonder.
