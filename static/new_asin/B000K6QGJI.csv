8154511,1,B000K6QGJI,"This is the worst ""how to"" DVD I've ever watched. The quaility is very poor, from the misspelled ""horsese"" on the cover to the grainy picture quality and so-so sound quality. There is about 15 minutes worth of helpful desensitizing excercises and the rest is just more of the same over and over again. Nothing on tying, trailering, or any of a hundred other things you need to know to give your colt or filly a good start in life. It is not worth the price. Heck, it's not worth 1/2 the price!",1203984000,,493,4.311827956989247
