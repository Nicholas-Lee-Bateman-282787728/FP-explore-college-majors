1969187,4,B00013RCAC,"This movie, a sequel to 1950's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cheaper-By-the-Dozen/dp/B00013RCAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cheaper By the Dozen</a>, continues the real-life adventures of the Gilbreth family, detailing scientist Dr. Lillian M. Gilbreth's struggles to raise a family alone after her husband's death. The film is a nice, warm, and entertaining family comedy, and features screen legends Myrna Loy and Jeanne Crain, songwriter Hoagy Carmichael, and Fox contract player Debra Paget, best known for her roles as a slave girl in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ten-Commandments/dp/B00AEBBACM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ten Commandments</a>, and as Elvis Presley's love interest in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Me-Tender/dp/B000E8N8TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Me Tender</a>, The King's film debut. For a non-musical, there is a lot of singing and dancing in this film, including a charming song-and-dance number with Paget and Carmichael. While Debra is not in the league of Ann Miller or Eleanor Powell, she has good tapping ability; like all Hollywood contract players, she had to learn to sing and dance when the role called for it, and acquitted herself well in the number.

Extras are minimal on this DVD. Like most Fox DVDs, there are English stereo, English mono, and Spanish audio tracks, English and Spanish subtitles, and theatrical trailers for both this film and two versions of CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN; the aforementioned 1950 original (the trailer is in B&W, even though the film is in Technicolor) and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2003-remake/dp/B0001EFTH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2003 remake</a>&nbsp;with Steve Martin. (A sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cheaper-by-the-Dozen-2/dp/B000HDRB8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cheaper by the Dozen 2</a>, was made in 2005). A comparison of the trailers is a strong indictment of Hollywood's decline; the kids are much more ill-mannered in 2003 than in 1950 or 1952. What a shame.  Three and a half to four stars.",1405123200,,2234,7.17948717948718

1969212,5,B00013RCAC,"This movie is a great wholesome family movie.  It is the further adventures of the Gilbreth family growing up.  The first movie Cheaper by the Dozen was a classic.  Mrs. Gilbreth was an industrial engineer alongside her late husband.  She is attempting to raise her twelve children with the help of a handy man and her older children.  She wants to go and give a lecture at a convention for fellow engineers.  Upon arrival she finds its for men only and she can not attend.  She finally gets a job teaching others to become industrial engineers in her home.  The movie also has some love interests for the older girls.  The handy man also makes homemade liquor in the basement.  In the end she attends her youngest daughters graduation, also reminiscing of the past.",1310601600,,766,4.649253731343284

1969215,5,B00013RCAC,"This is a fun and light-hearted family film that was filmed in the fifties and set in the twenties.  It can almost be considered a musical as there is much singing and dancing in it.  Including a very neat Shag dance scene.  The story centers around a widowed Mother trying to keep her large family together.  While facing the male-dominated work force of engineering.  She encounters lots of hurdles.  But, all in all, she is able to do it.  And very admirably so. My Mother thought the movie was borderline silly, but I really liked it.  Underneath the light-heartedness there are the deeper issues of keeping family together. I recommend it!",1252454400,2,644,4.738738738738738

1969218,5,B00013RCAC,This is the sequel to the original Cheaper By The Dozen. It continues the story of the Gilbreth family..the kids growing up etc. If you like older movies you will love this one.,1225584000,,177,4.393939393939394
1969219,5,B00013RCAC,this movie is delightful and wholesome. It takes you back to a time when people were down to earth and families stayed together through thick and thin. I was delighted to see most of the characters were on this move that took off from Cheaper by the Dozen with Clifton Webb. You will enjoy this move if you like Clifton Webb's other films. Even though he is not in this film it stands strong in comparison to what films he had made in the past.,1225238400,,444,4.235294117647059

1969222,4,B00013RCAC,"Few realize today that the ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" films with Steve Martin were actually sequels themselves.  If you've seen the orignal Cheaper by the Dozen with Myrna Loy than you know that Steve Martin's version didn't even attempt at staying close to the original storyline.  With that said, Belles on their Toes is a totally and completely different movie than the 2nd movie in Steve Martin's Cheaper by the dozen films.  In Belles on their Toes, we're treated to a story of how the 12 kids grew through the baby graduating.  This is a nice story and thoroughly enjoyable as a film in itself.  The fact that it's a sequel, in my opinion, doesn't add or detract from it's enjoyment factor.",1168128000,7,692,4.639344262295082

1969224,5,B00013RCAC,"""Belles on Their Toes"" is an excellent sequel to ""Cheaper by the Dozen""

 ""Belles on Their Toes"" picks up where the Gilbreth family left off in ""Cheaper by the Dozen.""  While many sequels leave much to be desired this sequel is even better than the predecessor.  In this movie the mother, Lillian, continues pioneering work in industrial engineering.

A perfect film for the entire family to watch, you won't find any sex, violence or foul language in this movie.  The hilarious goings-on of this real-life family will keep your entire family laughing in wanting to know more about this interesting real-life cast of characters.  While this film can be purchased in both Technicolor and black-and-white I still prefer the black-and-white version.

This classic movie teaches old-time values and will send your family straits the Internet to find out more about their fascinating lives.",1148601600,4,885,5.13986013986014
1969225,3,B00013RCAC,"There's an undeniable sweetness and charm to this film, but overall it just doesn't feel as satisfying and well-developed as the movie version of CBTD.  That movie wasn't entirely true to every bit of the book, but it overwhelmingly felt close to the book's spirit despite some things that were left out and some things that were invented.  In BOTT, the viewer doesn't get nearly as much a sense of period authenticity and details as in the original; it looks more like something from the Fifties instead of a story taking place in the Twenties.  And there were a lot of events from the book left out, commingled with a few things that did really happen in the book; the storyline definitely had far more liberties taken with it.  Missing all of these important events that really set the mood for how much this family cared for one another and what a great job they did getting by on their own, one doesn't really feel quite as connected to the characters and the plot as in the original.  (It was also interesting to note how they cut and pasted two different but similar events from the first and second books, the film of the family eating dinner at something like ten times the normal speed as opposed to the film of Mrs. Gilbreth demonstrating how time-saving the design of her kitchen was.)  The book focuses on Mrs. Gilbreth's struggle to raise her eleven children after her husband dies and how she steps into his shoes, even though she was a female engineer in a man's world at a time when many female professionals weren't taken seriously; in real life she was a lot more successful and welcomed than the movie makes her out to be.  It's enjoyable enough family entertainment, just lacks the continuity and even pacing of the original.  Because of all of the things that were left out and substituted for by things invented (perhaps to give it a more modern feel, like the scene of the beach barbeque/dance party), it just doesn't flow as naturally or seem quite as engaging.",1124064000,21,1986,4.606232294617564

1969228,5,B00013RCAC,"Delightful sequel to Cheaper By The Dozen, Belles on Their Toes, follows the adventures of the Gilbreth family following the death of father Frank (Clifton Webb).  Struggling to keep the family together, mother Lillian (Myrna Loy) continues the pioneering work in industrial engineering she started with her husband.  Eldest daughter Ann (Jeanne Crain) has struggles of her own.  Does she go off to college and pursue a life of her own, or stay home to help her mother with domestic matters, no small task since Ann is one of twelve children!  The cast is very appealing and although they seem too good to be true at times, it's hard not to be drawn into this heartwarming comedy.  Most of the cast from Cheaper repeats their roles in Belles, with the addition of a young Jeffrey Hunter and veteran character actor Edward Arnold.  Also in the cast, a young Debra Paget (as third daugher Martha), and an unbilled Martin Milner as an ""unsuitable"" boyfriend for Ernestine (Barbara Bates).  The Technicolor print for this film is superior to Cheaper By The Dozen, which is a plus.  The color looks new and vibrant and it will add to the overall positive experience of viewing this film.  As sequels go, Belles is pleasant and enjoyable family entertainment.",1079740800,54,1253,4.845070422535211

8006068,5,B00013RCAC,I think Cheaper By The Dozen is probably a better movie by a bit. But Belles on Their Toes is a great second act. It continues the story of the Gilbreth's lives after their father dies. Well worth watching.,1503446400,,206,4.3076923076923075
8006069,5,B00013RCAC,"A great sequel to the original (1950s) Cheaper by the Dozen.  The little kids are growing up now; what a life to have growing up in a large family!

8006071,5,B00013RCAC,"A film that encourages perseverance through tribulations for this family, although rather curious I remember from the first film that Mrs. Gilbrath had given birth to a baby boy name Robert ...yet in the beginning  of this sequel it shows that her daughter Jane is the last one to graduate. Which is rather strange. But all in all a great movie.",1482624000,,345,4.655737704918033
8006072,5,B00013RCAC,"Belles on their toes lives up to the first movie, cheaper by the dozen. It also continues the story from the first movie and for some reason, has a lot more musical numbers than the first. It has plenty of laughs but an abrupt ending.",1478217600,,234,4.222222222222222
