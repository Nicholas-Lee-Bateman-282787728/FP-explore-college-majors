6169749,4,B00HLTD5EG,"I actually kind of liked it. Sure the topic is very scary and in reality it's crazy to make jokes out of such stuff. It happens, it's real and it's the most dangerous thing that can happen to a person, in my humble opinion. But none the less I came for a comedy and it delivered. Was funnier than the first one and I liked it. Stupid? Yes, but it was funny. I really would like even more from the third movie.",1405641600,2,409,4.0
6169750,1,B00HLTD5EG,"Marlon Wayans really needs to give up on trying to make these parody movies work without the rest of the family on board. Yes, Scary Movie and even part 2 where classic comedies and some of the best parody films ever made, but he had the rest of his brothers with the exception of Damon and a whole crew of writers making that film. There was something like 12 writers making Scary Movie, and after that the Scary Movie franchise reigns where handed to 1 of the 3 legendary parody writers of movies like Airplane, The Naked Gun and Hot Shots (David Zucker)... while 2 of the 12 writers went off and have just about ruined parody movies since with all the ""(enter name here) Movie"" concoctions, and then Marlon decides to go solo and work on something like A Haunted House and this sequel, which screams out the question, WHY? For one, Marlon already did a haunted house movie with Scary Movie 2... then he goes and does A Haunted House which came out roughly the exact same time as Scary MoVie, and they where simmilar in what they where parodying.... why the heck did Marlon not just do the smart thing and team up with David Zucker and make another Scary Movie that would have combined the best of what Scary MoVie and Haunted House had, which wasn't much, but at least combining them would have possibly gotten at least a half decent movie out.

After seeing this one, it's clear Marlon can't do it on his own. I didn't not laugh out loud once during this whole thing, and probably because the strongest gags have been done already in previous Scary Movie movies. How many times can a penis show up on screen and be funny? It was done in Scary Movie 1, how many times is smashing an animal around gonna be funny? Again, done in both the other movies... and not to mention the fast forward Benny Hill style sex scenes... it's just been done to death already, and it's not funny seeing it repeated again and again.

Just quit Marlon, don't even try to make another parody unless you bring back your brothers, or even try hooking up with the Zuckers and Jim Abraham... on your own, you just ain't delivering the goods. This movie was a waste of time to make, and watch.",1405296000,2,2169,4.42
6169751,1,B00HLTD5EG,"""Prepare to meet your maker. I'm sending you back to Taiwan!"" After finally getting rid of his possessed ex, Malcolm (Wayans) has started a new life in a new house with his new girl Megan (Pressly). When the same thing starts happening again he thinks it has to do with a creepy doll. Once again Malcolm has to exercise something out of his life. So I will say that I thought the first one was funny for about 20 minutes then started to get old. Most spoof movies are like that though so I won't hold it against them. I in no way thought this needed a sequel. After about five minutes I was certain that they didn't need a sequel. While the first one kept me laughing for about half the time I don't think I even smiled at all watching this one. It may be that the humor just wasn't for me but some of the jokes went on way to long and they weren't funny to start with (the sex scene with the doll for example). It had the right idea mixing Sinister and The Conjuring for the main story line but they didn't do anything with it. Overall, a movie that started off annoying and never really got better, I really struggled to get through this one. I give it a D.",1403136000,4,1159,4.132743362831858
6169752,1,B00HLTD5EG,"The movie basically recycles jokes from the first two Scary movies and then as filler uses sex jokes. The affair scenes with the doll are not funny, very unsettling. The lack of any real humor is probably why the Wayans were kicked off from the Scary movie franchise. There's only so many times a penis can be used as a gag. The first movie had more originality. They phoned this one in. Do not waste your money on this.",1402790400,3,420,4.329113924050633
6169753,4,B00HLTD5EG,"Malcolm (Marlon Wayans) has moved on and married Megan (Jaime Pressly) who has a moody teen daughter (Ashley Rickards) and a son with an imaginary playmate.  The haunting begins immediately as Malcolm has ""an affair"" with a haunted doll left behind from the previous owner, one that goes ""Fatal Attraction"" on him. Malcolm views home movies also left behind with the hanging people in the back yard and a guy who ""looks as ugly as Steve Tyler."" The daughter carries around a large found wooden box, which plays no other part than to be a source for crude box jokes.

The film is similar in style and humor to the original, i.e. if you loved that one, you should love this one. I had a few LOL moments, including when the dog died...my bad. The film also has crude moments and explicit sex talk.  Some knowledge of drugs is helpful. OG Kush is marijuana and Molly is ecstasy.

I wasn't expecting much, but it greatly exceeding my expectations. This was quite a funny movie. Very vulgar and sexually explicit, so don't watch it with your grandparents, but it was 10x better than the first one. I would say it's worth watching for sure. You will definitely get some laughs.

6170310,3,B00HLTD5EG,"I don't really even know where to begin on this one.

This movie is the kind of funny that is on the level of Beavis and Butthead.  Meaning it is so stupid and it has people doing crazy things and stereotype jokes that you can't help but laugh because it's just so stupid.  We have Marlon Wayans being crazy and goofy just the way we like him.  We have Jaime Pressly here and it was strange not hearing her with the redneck accent like she did in My Name is Earl, but she plays her role pretty well.  Also we have Gabriel Iglesias playing up the Mexican stereotype but he makes it hilarious in the way only he can.

The plot is pretty much non-existent in this movie.  It's just them making jokes and poking fun at like 4 or 5 popular horror films from the past few years like Sinister, Paranormal Activity 3 & 4, The Possession and the Conjuring.

Any fan of slapstick comedy will like this as well as any fans of the original movies themsevles.  However don't go into this movie expecting something that is genius.  This is just something meant to be laughed at and enjoyed.

6170354,1,B00HLTD5EG,"The sequel. OMG!!! Why in the name of everything that is holy, did they make another one? If the first didn't make you want to perform an exorcism on yourself, then this is the movie that will probably require a bath in a healthy dose of holy water. It's vulgar, nasty, offensive, and just plain stupid. Numerous movies are lampooned here, including ""The Conjuring""; ""Insidious""; and ""The Possession."" The movie starts out innocently enough with Marlon Wayans starting his life over after the events of the first film. He's got a new girl with two children of her own, and a new dog. The dog bit was the best part. The rest abounds with foul and offensive language that is a hallmark of every Wayans brother movie ever made, more offensive Mexican jokes, crude references to body parts and sex.

The movie will go down in history as the foulest thing you will ever see. The scene with the doll made me want to pop my eyes out, scrub them in bleach, and replace them with a pair that hadn't had the misfortune of seeing Marlon getting it on with the creepy equivalent of Glenn Close in ""Fatal Attraction.""  After taking part in dolly porn (Marlon violates that poor doll in every way imaginable and films it!) he's surprised to find he's being stalked by the thing. I was rooting for the doll in case you're wondering.

Well, after discovering there's a demon in his house, the movie sets out to remind us of the far better movies that inspired this lame imitation. And that's mostly what happens. Marlon swears a blue streak. White jokes abound. Mexican gardener and low-rider jokes for the sake of making fun of the fat guy across the street mowing his lawn and he MUST be the help, you know, just because he's MEXICAN!!!

I didn't care to see the rest. Foul, crude, vulgar, nasty, and just plain abhorrent, you will regret spending your hard-earned money to view this travesty in the horror spoof genre. I'd much rather have Freddy Kruger rip my eye sockets out, have Jason crack my skull open like a casaba melon, and have Jigsaw put some sort of evil contraption on my head so I won't ever see a Wayans film ever again!!

6170411,4,B00HLTD5EG,"The 411:

The humor is crass, inappropriate, racist, and sexual but if you are looking for a movie that makes you laugh, smile, and say to yourself ""oh no they didn't!"" then this is for you.

Come on people it's a Wayans brother at his best so expect some laughs but even more the second time because they are so detailed with their humor you miss some things the first time around.

 In the sequel, we start out with Malcolm and his possessed girlfriend in a taxi. There is a crash and we fast forward to Malcolm living with his new girlfriend and her two kids in a dream home. Once again he has to deal with supernatural phenomenon of the worst kind including his girlfriend's son's punk, invisible friend and possessed daughter.

What I find the most entertaining is how Marlon will go anywhere for a laugh, I mean anywhere. Watching Marlon have sex with a strange, evil doll was funny because of how shocking it was.  This is NOT a film for any under 18 years of age so don't even think it is just crude humor. Malcolm HAS SEX every which way including and limited to squirting and salad tossing (look it up I am not about to explain it).

Some movies make us think, some make us feel, this movie made me gasp. The jokes are colorful, don't bother watching if you are easily offended by sexual or racist humor but if you are into that kind of thing get ready to be entertained.",1410393600,4,1381,4.329457364341085

But evil spirits aren't done with Malcolm yet, and soon invade his home, particularly in the guise of a very disturbing doll who looks very much like the one in The Conjuring, who Malcolm ... umm ... ends up ""getting freaky with,"" only to regret it (this storyline being reason #1 to watch).  The humor is crass, very R-rated, at times eye-rollingly lame and at others hilarious - and, in the cases of an early scene with Malcolm and his fluffy white dog, or later as Malcolm tries to kill a rooster as a sacrifice, pee-your pants funny (reasons #2 and #3).  Wayans has yet to learn how to construct a good ending, but in terms of humor this one's actually better than its predecessor.",1409529600,5,1077,4.59375
6170501,4,B00HLTD5EG,"Lots and lots of fun. I actually think I liked this one more that the first one, I think it is because there are more eccentric characters going on here, Cedric the Entertainer is back, so funny! Gabriel Iglesias as the neighbor is priceless. Marlon is of course terrific, his cousin is back and so are 2 exorcists...great characterizations and OMG the doll, Sarah...pure evil. This takes up right after the first and Marlon has lost his first love to demonic possession and has a new girl Jaime Pressley and her 2 kids. not for young kids at all but all others will laugh out loud. And when Marlon takes a shot at the Scary Movies...also priceless.",1409529600,4,649,4.555555555555555
6170502,3,B00HLTD5EG,"Wayans - and the film has that humor, but the previews for this were better than the actual film - in compare to the first one (which I loved by the way) they are way way too ""choppy"".  Heavy cut-aways and cut-ins where they should have done like they did the first film - parody and use the same flow as the original P.A. they were spoofing.  Wayans humor flows well and by the heavy cut in / out method they did in their sequel - it really took away from that humor.  I agree with the other reviewers, the doll sex scenes were ""yeeesh"" and we saw this the first film with the stuffed toys.  It is still worth a rental but if you intend to buy, wait for the price to come down.  The humor in it is Wayans and still Wayans-good, but they were so spastic with the scenes so chopped up (for effect) that they almost turned it into a collection of one-line gags and don't leave room for much build up which makes the punch line work SO much better.",1409443200,,945,4.0864864864864865

6170505,4,B00HLTD5EG,"If you live spoof horror movies and the first ""A Haunted House"" this is for you. There is a lot of subtle humor and the trademark Wayne humor. Overall we enjoyed it",1409443200,,164,4.15625
6170506,1,B00HLTD5EG,"There is a joke in A HAUNTED HOUSE 2 where Marlon Wayans comments about how bad the SCARY MOVIE series is without the involvement of the Wayans brothers. If their involvement would result in something like this movie I don't think it would help and could possibly make that series even worse. As it stands this movie is one of the worst I've seen when it comes to parody films. Even the involvement of one Wayans brother harms more than helps.

Story wise we have Malcolm (Marlon Wayans) still plagued by evil spirits. While the possessed girl friend of the first film has died, Malcolm now has a new family in the form of girlfriend Megan (Jamie Presley) and her two children. Here we get parodies of several recent horror films as the daughter falls prey to a demon filled box (ala SAM RAIMI'S THE POSSESSION) while Malcolm finds himself involved with a doll that's pure evil (ala THE CONJURING). Malcolm once again finds himself in a house that is haunted and has to recruit help in taking out the demons.

The problem is there is so little that is funny in this film that I kept thinking to myself isn't this supposed to be a comedy? Thinking back I counted the number of times I actually laughed or even smiled while watching it and I could count that number on one hand not using my thumb in the process. The worst thing about the movie was that Wayans made the poor choice to take what could have been a decent joke on several occasion and beat the joke to death like the proverbial dead horse until the original joke was forgotten, replaced by the repetitive joke it became. First joke, funny. Making that joke last 30 seconds to 2 minutes? Boring. As the joke carried on and on and on it made me long to press down the fast forward button in the hopes it would end. Instead I held fast and was rewarded with more and more unfunny moments.

Looking back on watching this movie I couldn't find anything to praise about it. I just kept thinking that it was like torture watching it from start to finish. It was also sad. Knowing that Wayans can be a good actor from past films he's been in and a good writer as seen in many films he's helped with it disturbed me to think he thought this was up to par with those films in the past. Had I written this film I would have been ashamed to attach my name to it. I have to think he was surrounded by yes men telling him that everything he did, said or wrote down was funny. When you surround yourself with people like that you can't do your best work. It would have been better to stock those around you with people telling you that yes emperor, you aren't wearing any clothes.

While there have been a number of parodies by people involved with the SCARY MOVIE franchise that have been terrible enough to make me steer clear of any film whose advertising states that writers involved in that first film have made this new one, I now have to add Wayans name to that list. This film is as bad as a number of those films, movies like EPIC MOVIE and MEET THE SPARTANS. In no way would I want this film to be added to my collection for fear that it might infect other films with how bad it is. Many people these days trade movies they get after discovering how much they don't enjoy it. I would say that anyone choosing to do so risk the chance of doing harm to anyone who would pick up even a used copy of this film. If word of mouth does anything it will cause this film to languish on the shelf in an overabundance of used copies. Yes, it really is that bad.",1409356800,4,3507,4.27710843373494

I was going to let my (elder) parents barrow this movie, but after reviewing it...whoa! That will never happen! I saved them from much embarrassment. Guys this is not a family movie at all, so don't embarrass yourself or your family, could be very awkward. Keep kids away from this movie. For the appropriate adult audience, say 18 or at least 21 years or older, this is a great movie, hands down. But while watching it alone, I was a little surprised and caught off guard by the sexual graphic content. Its very shocking! Its nothing you would want a child to see.  So parents be careful with this one. Other than that, it's a great movie for (adults). Buy it on Blu ray. This one is a classic, indeed.

6170741,1,B00HLTD5EG,"I caught the first ""A Haunted House"" on PPV.  I did not think I would be entertained given the movie was yet another ""spoof"" of movies.  I was wrong.  I laughed just about throughout this movie, and I gave it a positive rating.  And then, part 2 was released.  Borrowing heavily from any of the Paranormal movies, the Conjuring, and Insidious, you would think they could have come up with SOMETHING entertaining.

I don't know how people involved in the film industry can sit around, produce this giant T*URD of a mess--all the while thinking it's funny, and then have the nerve to call it a movie.  There was nothing funny in this sequel.  A script that resembled Swiss cheese, with really no plausible plot, this was actually excrutiating to watch.  Most of what could have been funny was taken to such an extreme that it became nauseating to watch.  Yes, I'm talking all the sex scenes with the Doll.  Had it stopped halfway through, it might have been palatable.  Instead, you are privy to watching Marlan Wayans simulate doing anything and everything to a doll.  In fact, MOST of the movie consists of scenes of this type.  You've got implied incest, Mexican-Americans and African-Americans stereotyped to the ""inth"" degree, and children dropping the F-bomb.  If you feel your only chance to sell your movie is on such garbage, you need to simply get out of the business.

If Wayans' intention was to make a funny sequel, he failed miserably.  If it was his intention to shock and nauseate his audience, he must be thrilled to death.

How this movie starts

This 2nd edition starts off with Malcolm with possessed Keisha sitting on the back seat of his friends car while his buddy is driving Keisha gets scary as hell, she and Malcolm struggle. Keisha lunges forward and starts choking the driver causing the car to crash. After the crash Malcolm and his bud look at each other like what am I going to do? Say deuces and start running. Then it goes into where he's married to Jamie Presley she has 2 kids and they move into a house that unknown to them has a spooky past of it's own

Sample of some of what you'll see

Dude doing nasties aka man doll porn with a creepy psychotic doll and recording it, yep it's that graphic and goes on for way too long to the point where it's annoying, it becomes a fatal attraction situation, now that is pretty messed up, I know right? Doll keys his car etc. I am not even gonna tell ya what he does to dolly dearest after digging a hole and throwing her in it puts the N in nasty and G in gross I was what the %#@*? They've got cameras all throughout the house 24/7 it does get scary as hell near the end like the exorcist type scary, eek props for that though. Unlike the first one that had me rolling in laughter through nearly the whole movie sadly this one did not
