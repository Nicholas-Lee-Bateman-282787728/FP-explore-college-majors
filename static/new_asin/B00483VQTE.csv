4285693,5,B00483VQTE,"This is not the first chemtrail documentary but it is the first one to have this level of production value and also be a bit more focused. Chemtrails are introduced as being distinguished from contrails, contrails being water vapor and disappearing fairly quickly behind normal planes, by not only not disappearing quickly, but often spreading across the sky and sometimes actually turning an otherwise clear sunny day into a cloudy overcast sky, and this is cause for concern. It is determined pretty early on what they are spraying, aluminum mostly and a few other things, from taking snow, water, soil, and even hair samples in highly controlled environments.

Now the question becomes why are they doing this. The film introduces a few theories - To combat global warming, To destroy to the organic food industry, To somehow work in tandem with the HAARP facility in Alaska, and many others. However, they do a good job of staying focused on what we can currently prove, which is the fact that the program is harmful and destructive to humans, plants, and animals, no matter which specific theory may or may not be true, and this is all that is needed to present a case to our elected officials.

I thought this statement said it best, that ""we are doing the work that the police and government should be doing"" to describe those who are actively working to bring attention to this issue. After viewing the film, the filmmakers encourage you to make your own copies of the film for non-profit purposes to hand out and help raise awareness of the chemtrail issue.

The movie states basically that they started spraying to manipulate the weather and now they can not stop because they damaged the ozone layer.

I think a stronger case could have been made about the physical consequences of people breathing in these sprayed particles. Dr. Blaylock has a video on You Tube which covers this aspect better. Could this at least partially account for the epidemic of cancer and increase in Alzheimer's Disease?

Supposedly they are about weather control but if that's the case they certainly aren't doing a very good job because our weather is horrific.  We are in a drought of record while the Midwest and East Coast are suffering as well with too much rain.  Of course the main question is who is doing this and what is the real reason?

This DVD explores the effects of chemtrails and asks lots of questions that need to be answered.  My primarily criticism is that it could use a good editing job.  It drags on a little longer than necessary, belabors the point somewhat beyond what becomes intuitively obvious and in general gives the impression of being produced by amateurs.

4285708,1,B00483VQTE,"This video represents the best 'evidence' of the Chemtrail Conspiracy.

The summary of the movie goes like this.

Normal Contrails fade away quickly
 Scientists have talked about geoengineering using aluminum sprayed from planes
 Since 1999, trails have been observed to persist for a long time
 Tests in various locations at ground level have found different levels of aluminum
 Monsanto has genetically engineered  aluminum resistent crops
 The government denies any spraying or geoengineering is going on
 THEREFORE:  The trails are aluminum being sprayed as part of a secret government geoengineering project.

Normal contrails may persist or dissapate based on levels of humidity and elevation.  This has been described in atmospheric reference books at least since 1981.  The scientist in the video discussing geoengineering is a TED talk taken out of context where the researcher is talking about THEORETICAL ways to combat global warming.  Aluminum makes up 7% (and in areas with high volcanic activity 30-60%) of the Earth's crust and aluminum IONS (the part that's toxic to plants ) is influenced by soil ph.  This has been known for over 100 years and Monsanto has been working on aluminum resistant seeds since 1921,  long before the Chemspirists say spraying began.

Think about it:  Climatologists have put their reputations and careers on the line defending global warming are doing an ideological 180 and covering up mass poisoning of the Earth.

There's plenty of credible environmental problems to worry about:  global warming, fracking and acid rain.  We divert energy and damage our credibility from these causes for pseudoscience like this.",1395273600,12,1661,5.385214007782102

4285716,5,B00483VQTE,"I feel the film is not well done... however it is informative and at least makes you feel a little better that someone is trying to do something about it however futile it may be!

I have experienced this first-hand while living in Arizona... I moved there from Colorado and I called home shortly after moving there... the Sedona area... and told my parents that when it rains here... instead of my car being cleaner as was the case at the time in Colorado... in Arizona my car became dirtier... covered with a fine white powdery film all over the car.  It was a dark blue car so it really showed up well!

Of course, noticing it so blatantly on the car caused me to notice it on other objects as well... it was scarey... at the time there was also allot of controversy going on about ""acid rain""!

I started to ask questions of my clients, friends and acquaintances and that was the first I heard about chem-trailing and after being told about it and the cris-crossing trails by jets in the sky always very early in the mornings... I started to actually observe it taking place!  The last thing it is is ""Normal"" contrailing!!!  Get a functioning Brain for anyone who could possible lie themselves into believing it could be ""normal""!

Additionally, around this time the topic of Alzheimers becoming an Epidemic in America was heating up!  And many said that if you had the white powder which fell from the sky testing it was filled with aluminum just as stated in this film.  I had friends and acquaintances who had it tested and it was filled with aluminum which is Supremely Toxic to our Body and especially our Brains!!!  Wake up America!  You are being turned into dementia idiots... what an easy way to take over America no Warfare... or the world for that matter...

As there is also talk about the possibility of this being a well-planned take over of the earth by aliens whose bodies are able to live in an Aluminum atmosphere...  killing off the earthlings... they walk-in and take over... and if you do not think this is possible you better think again... that is while you are still able to think with that Brain!  Before they Kill it!  Some say the Illuminati and some say One World Government which in all probability are one in the same... Yet the alien theory rings true solely from the standpoint that WHY would a true earthling want to destroy his own habitat and the habitat of his children and their children's children.  ???  Illuminati or not... they must have relatives that they would care about... who would be lost to this massive destruction of aluminum pollution in our AIR -- thus when you think about it the alien premise begins to make some sense!

In this movie there are many renown people... scientists... etc.  not nit-wits... trustworthy, intelligent and intellectual people who they themselves have run tests... this is real... I have personally witnessed it!  There has been an abundance of testing that has Proven It is Happening!

Yet another aspect...  is in Colorado, for example... in the 40's and 50's forest fires were put out fairly easily with the dumping of the chemicals and water by planes.  Now, they cannot get the fires out... the fires are burning much HOTTER... and tests have been run... the fact is the air is filled with Aluminum particles which are Extremely Flammable... thus now... they are unable to get these HOT-Fires out by the same means they used to and certainly not until these fires have murdered and destroyed thousands acres and hundreds of people and animals!!

This aluminum did not get in our air naturally... people... wake up before it is too LATE!!!

Certainly if you have children and/or grandchildren... don't you care about them enough to get off your duff... and try to band together and do something about the total and mass destruction of our earth and us... as we know it... it is going on Right Now!

In the name of GOD Wake up!",1371945600,5,3915,4.629522431259045

4285727,1,B00483VQTE,"First off I'd like to say this film is designed to be convincing, not factual - pseudo-science can be entirely convincing for those with little to no scientific background. These same people decry scientists around the globe who view ""chemtrails"" with skepticism as ""shills"" who are ""on the payroll"". Simultaneously they pretend to use science themselves to prove their theory.

I won't even bother going into detail about the glaring holes within this film, for those who care it's already been methodically dissected - google ""what in the world are they spraying debunked"".

However, I will add that a bit of common sense and math indicates ""chemtrails"" are physically impossible:

Consider that in an area with close to a 180 degree of view of the sky, trails stretching from horizon to horizon can be over 500 miles in length. Often times the planes you see at an angle in the sky can be over different states/countries entirely.

This is the first sign that what you see CANNOT be carried and sprayed from within the aircraft. The largest plane designed for carrying liquids and spraying them from altitude is the 747 supertanker, which has a capacity of roughly 24,000 gallons. Over the course of 500 miles, that works out to a constant spray rate of 1 gallon per 110 feet.

Here's the kicker:
Over 500 miles the best spray rate you can hope for is 1 gallon per 110 feet. Increase the spray rate, and you decrease the length of the trails possible. Decrease the spray rate and there's no way in hell you can make trails thick enough that they A: aren't blown apart instantly by atmospheric winds and B: are visible from the ground.

At 1gal/110 feet, this is already nowhere near enough to produce the aforementioned affects either.....so we're looking at: if ""chemtrails"" are real, they would be incredibly short. They would not stretch for hundreds of miles like this video would have you believe.

If you need help visualizing this, go look up videos of firefighting planes in action. These are planes -designed- to pack as much material in them as possible. Yet, they disperse materials over an area that is a FAR, FAR cry from the trails in the sky stretching for hundreds of miles. Even the 747 supertanker can only leave a trail about 3 miles long.",1353456000,10,2261,4.752551020408164
4285728,3,B00483VQTE,"I recently saw this movie on Youtube, where it's available for free. I admit that I'm very ambivalent about it.

The film hawks a conspiracy theory known as Chemtrails, according to which the U.S. military is conducting secret experiments on a massive scale by dumping aluminium and other toxic substances into the air from unmarked aircraft. The toxins create ""chemtrails"", which criss-cross the sky and look very different from ordinary contrails. Sceptics consider them contrails or unusual cloud formations, and have written off the Chemtrail conspiracy theory as a hoax.

""What in the world are they spraying"" is produced by Reality Zone, the website of G. Edward Griffin, a member and long-time officer of the John Birch Society, a conservative-minimal government group which believes in a variety of conspiracy theories, including the existence of the Illuminati (which the Birchers refer to as the Insiders). G. Edward Griffin should not be confused with David Ray Griffin, a left-liberal scholar who also believes in conspiracy theories! The documentary features the conservative Griffin plus some people of more uncertain political provenance, including a former Arizona state senator.

I'm not convinced by the Chemtrail conspiracy theory itself. And no, I probably couldn't tell a contrail from a cloud! The problem is more general. Griffin believes that the conspiracy is vast and spans every NATO country. It's not clear how long the illegal spraying has been going on, but according to Wikipedia, the theory saw the light of the day in 1996. That's 16 years ago. Is it really likely that a global, secret conspiracy could be going on at a permanent basis since the mid-1990's without anyone blowing the whistle? The purpose of the conspiracy is also unclear. Is it geo-engineering to cool down the weather and hence avert climate change? If so, it doesn't seem to be working very well! Besides, since when does the John Birch Society believe in climate change? Another theory is population control. But if so, why not spray Third World nations instead? As for the population of the United States, it isn't contracting, suggesting that the conspiracy has failed. In sum, the Chemtrails conspiracy theory sound both far-fetched and illogical.

At the same time, I can understand why conspiracy theories of this kind may arise. The U.S. military seems to have been involved in a long range of bizarre, secretive operations during the Cold War, including tests of germs and LSD on involuntary subjects. MK-Ultra is another classic in the genre. These tests were classified for decades. According to Wikipedia, the conspiracy theories about Chemtrails were inspired by a speculative, futurist study published by the U.S. Air Force! The study apparently speculated about the military applications of weather modification.

To sceptics, this proves that Chemtrails is a hoax. Personally, I consider it somewhat chilling that a conspiracy theory peddled by the John Birch Society is partially based on a techno-maniac report published by the U.S. military itself?!

It's almost as if the conspiracy theorists were feeding on the lunacy of the real world...

I'm not sure if that counts as reassuring.",1349568000,7,3207,5.239766081871345

4285731,4,B00483VQTE,"They do something far worse: they play man.  And, as G Edward Griffin says at several points in this documentary: follow the money.  And - lo and behold! - Monsanto had the great foresight to patent GMO seeds that are aluminum resistant!  Wow!  Talk about a coincidence!  A snow sample from California's Mt Shasta registered 61 times the EPA ""safe"" amount of aluminum (or was that ""sludge"" as one reviewer said?).  Coconut trees in Hawaii can be splintered with bare hands.  Trees in Arizona are turning silvery and dying.  Tests from all these regions show massively elevated readings of aluminum, barium and strontium - which are precisely the elements geo-engineers propose using if they were to decide to seed the atmosphere.  Of course, they haven't decided to do that yet.  How do we know they haven't?  Because they said so - and, as everyone knows, scientists are incapable of such basic human flaws as lying.  Not to mention that once the ""science"" is out there, anyone with a chemistry set and an airplane can accomplish what the scientists have yet to decide to do.

The fact is, this happens to be an extremely well-documented documentary.  If, as another reviewer points out, G Edward Griffin is a member of the John Birch Society - so what?  Does that make statistics a reporter showed him suddenly suspect?  If so, then an urgent FYI to anyone with similar statistics: don't EVER show them to a John Bircher or they will turn fraudulent right before your eyes!

Toward the end is a pointless segment showing the film maker canvassing Congress trying to get members to take Chemtrails seriously.  Everyone already knows by now that Congress takes its marching orders from corporations; it doesn't respond to citizen complaints, no matter how well documented.  This segment is grand-standing, pure and simple (a la Alex Jones).  The time would have been better spent presenting more data.

This documentary needs to be seen - and, above all, researched.  I agree with anyone who says don't take it at face value without any reservations - because that's true of anything.  I certainly plan to do as much independent research as possible regarding this subject - though I suspect there's never been a concerted effort in the scientific community to set any but the most cursory information before the public.

If have noticed the waves of respiratory issues and sore throats that follow these events and watched them happen for years. I don't need convincing, but it is good to see all the evidence in one place. Back in 2007, television station KLSA in Louisiana responded to a viewers concern about the massive chemtrailing and tested some of the material he'd collected. It contained dangerous levels of Barium. Barium and Aluminum are constantly being found in these. Barium can cause heart problems and wear down your immune system. It could be behind some of our rise in heart disease, but no one is ever tested for Barium and Aluminum on a routine basis. You can still find the news story online. The station was so besieged by hundreds of calls from around the nation that it decided not to spend more resources on it.

Of the many frightening things mentioned, not the least was that the aluminum is highly flammable making forest fires more deadly and we have seen that in the outbreaks in Texas last summer.  However, the scariest thing by far and the reason everyone needs to watch this was the reaction of congress. One representative after another refused to acknowledge that he knew anything about geo-engineering and literally RAN away, ducking into offices and not looking happy to be asked about it. Why didn't they just say thanks and ask for information??? Because they were told not to talk about it??? By whom?? The only person who was willing to stop and talk when asked to consider the topic was the man who was chairing the committee to ""discuss whether geo-engineering was a good idea"". He said he didn't agree with it and smiled as if they should be pleased. When they told him it was already going on right over his head, he denied it.  What does this say??? To me it says that we have no congress and they know it. They are well paid to keep up the pretense, but these people we think we are electing to protect us from things such as this are just going through the motions of playing a game that someone else is running.

This is the worst kind of pseudo-scientific ""expos"". The filmmakers should have just chartered a private jet and gone up and taken a sample of one of their supposed ""chem-trails"", then had it independently analyzed. Would have been a far better use of the money spent on making another alarmist film for the true believers of this 10- or 15-year-old conspiracy creed.

The film is spearheaded by G. Edward Griffin, a long-time conspiracy theorist, 'documentary' producer, and John Birch Society member. (Look him up on Wikipedia to get an idea where the guy stands on cancer treatments, the Federal Reserve, and Noah's Ark. That will set an appropriate tone for the movie.) The film starts with the assumption that something sinister is going on owing to anecdotal evidence that there are 'obvious' differences between real airplane contrails and 'chem-trails'. Snippets from several Geo-engineering lectures and panel discussions are presented where scientists are exploring ideas on how climate change might be arrested or reversed by spraying materials such as aluminum into the upper atmosphere. A few basically innocuous sentences are taken out of context and highlighted as representing a nefarious agenda. Suddenly, the filmmakers have their connection between these strange airplane contrails and (supposedly) elevated levels of aluminum, barium, and strontium being discovered independently in water and soil samples around the country. And it's all downhill from there: for the remainder of the film we are subjected to ominous mood music and much worry from mostly ordinary people (including one middle school girl) and a very few eccentric-looking 'scientists' about what might be going on in the skies above. Some 'evidence' of elevated levels of the aforementioned elements is presented; at other times, there are completely tenuous connections made without any supporting biochemical analysis wherein alarmed observers decry what is happening to trees whose bark is turning silver or peeling off at rate never before seen by these particular individuals. The conclusion? Well, it *must* be the chem-trails!

Two more examples of the kind of 'evidence' used to incite us to believe that something strange is going on:

A little girl's hair is shown to have an abnormally high level of aluminum; but it turns out the levels were measured against a scale used for adults; and multiple sources show that children excrete much higher levels of aluminum than adults do. So the evidence says nothing. (And what about the rest of the girl's family, or her friends and neighbors? Surely, they would also have shown unusual levels of aluminum? But of course the film doesn't even mention this avenue of investigation.)

Another bit of 'evidence' looks at the alarming level of aluminum in a 'water' sample; but it turns out that the sample was not of water, but of *sludge*--water mixed with soil--and that the levels of aluminum in this *soil* sample are perfectly within normal boundaries. There's basically no scientific rigor in the presentation of findings. This is only a fact-finding mission insofar as the filmmakers have already come to a conclusion and are now using very selective evidence to 'prove' their case, while ignoring everything that flies in the face of their beliefs.

I wonder if these believers have ever really considered the massive levels of secrecy that would need to be behind this conspiracy (which supposedly extends to other NATO countries). I mean, we're talking about thousands of engineers, technicians, pilots, and ground crew--not to mention the military and government officials (and their staff) in on the plan *as well as* all the independent soil, water, and atmospheric analysts around this country and others. And there's been no whistle-blower? Nobody armed with a cellphone camera has come forward with incriminating pictures of modified planes to post on Wiki-leaks? Nobody can gather conclusive evidence of tampering from soil samples results from around the country? Nobody has been able to take a plane up and get even *one* chemical sample during this supposedly *massive* effort to coat the atmosphere? Nobody? Really?

And what of the supposedly persistent haze that now covers our once clear blue skies? Do these people have any idea how much air traffic has grown since the 1970s? The number of planes in the sky at any one time? The number of routes that have been added? Have they heard nothing of 'global dimming'--the result of the increase in atmospheric particulates, much of it as a result of air traffic? Yes, it may be cause for concern, but pollution and 'Geo-engineering cover-up' are not the same thing.

What about the 'differences' between contrails and the supposedly persistent 'chem-trails'? I was going to pick apart the most obvious evidence bit by bit, but after a bit of research I had to say, ""Why bother?"" Someone else has already done the debunking: just Google ""contrail science"" and choose the website of the same name. Hilariously, there are chem-trail believers posting there who, despite repeated requests for verifiable data, can offer no proof of their own--only insinuations that the webmaster is an arm of the government cover-up (they would probably say the same thing about me!). It's like trying to reason with religious fundamentalists who deny the evidence behind evolution.

In my opinion, the chem-trail hoax basically preys on the fact that many people are disillusioned with government, poorly-educated in critical thinking, and that direct study of contrails and other atmospheric phenomena is out of reach of the majority of people. Many also seem to share a general disillusionment with science and technology for their role as tools in the widespread destruction of the ecosystem. Hence their suspicion of any scientific data that contradicts their foregone conclusion that ordinary people are at the mercy of some secret ruling elite.

If you are a critical thinker and are familiar with scientific method, I recommend this movie for a good laugh. Or maybe you are skeptical, but willing to concede the possibility that something *might* be going on; in this case, watch the movie. Just don't stop there! Check out the alternative explanations on the website mentioned.

If you are already a True Believer, then no amount of contrary evidence is going to convince you that Geo-engineering on this scale is not yet going on. Watch this movie with your like-minded friends and continue to call all the skeptics 'sheeple' while you pride yourself on possession of top-secret knowledge.",1316217600,27,6628,5.208255159474672
4285738,4,B00483VQTE,"I saw a full length video of this online, check out Facebook and YouTube for more information, you can always search InfoWars, or just the title of this DVD.

This must be pointed out that I am very stingy with 5 star ratings, you can check my other reviews. If I give 5 stars, it's because the product has vasts amounts of value and weight to make it worth the time, energy and expense. I gave this video 4 stars because I don't want a real honest review to get buried by conspiracy theorists with an agenda, and marketers who post two sentence long praise. With that in mind, this is a actually a 5 star rating I give this video.

I can only hope this DVD gets as much attention as Super Size Me, unlike that film though which is really a conspiracy theory against McDonalds, this video is hard critical reserach, sience, and investigative study into a very abstract omnipresent ""thing"" that is chemtrails, that has very specific and very real, measurable affects on micro and macro biology. My dad is a former USGS soil survey specialist and historian of the natural landscape, one of the most brilliant people I know and I am bringing this video to his attention as I write this.

On the point where the senator talks about dying trees, as well as others in the video, as a truck driver who travels all of the 48 continental United States, I spend vasts amounts of time in the middle of nowhere, in the mountains and deserts and I live in Los Angeles, I was born and raised in a small farm town in Illinois far from any major city.... As a person who grew up around nature, I grew to understand trees very well from a sense of feeling. I can't explain it but there are micro details in individual trees that tell me about it, and I've learned these tell-tail signs in my many years climbing trees.

Fast forward to the present I am now 24 years old, I drive through the rocky mountains and I will get great arial views of the hill side from the road, and I see patchy and staggering individuals of trees that have fallen ill very fast, and died off in an extremely unnatural way that always makes me wonder what is happening. When pests invade such as various beetles that kill trees, they gradually start from one area and head to the next over time, by ""area"" I mean an entire state, not just a mile here or a mile there. These trees I see afflicted in these beautiful forests in remote mountains hundreds of miles east of major cities are affected in the same way you would expect metal to rust if you layed out a sheet of thin metal, and sprayed bleach into the air and let it fall naturally, causing rust to appear in random places. Sometimes individual trees, sometimes entire large sections of a mountain, if not the entire side.

And trees that die in various ways, will have various different appearances, whether it's disease, beetle infestation, physical damage by birds and animals or humans, castration that cuts off circulation, suffocation, poison, or some environmental disaster, and even old age.

Trees that die of most ""normal"" events don't look like the space ship pilot with Chubaka in the original Star Wars movies who got sealed in a sheet of metal for his prison. I feel ashamed I don't know the details of the scene but it goes to show what you forget and what you learn when you spend your time studying something of actual value to society.

If you you turn off the DVD and never watch it again, I hope you come away with a new sense of confidence and certainty that even if this DVD is 100% fake, that the agenda of the United States and much of the world is not as the founding fathers of the Constitution intended. And it is now advancing in ways so incredible, nobldy could have imagined half of this 75 years ago, let alone 250 years ago. Can you imagine the world 5 years from now? what about 75? This is why it's important to be proactive. Be proactive in ways meaningful to you.

The documentary opens with journalist Michael Murphy questioning a corporate scientist at a conference on geoengineering about the possible toxic effects of the aerosols (a.k.a. chemtrails) being sprayed in the atmosphere around the world--specifically Aluminum particles. The scientist said that the effects of aluminum was the first thing they studied. But when the journalist asked him to confirm that their studies showed no negative health effects from aluminum aerosols, he nervously backtracked and said they haven't studied the toxicological aspects.

Backed by G Edward Griffin and a host of supporters, these journalists embarked on a documentary to chronicle their investigations across the US and Europe. Speaking with many scientists with impeccable credentials, they accumulated massive evidence of a mountain of toxic particulate material falling on us regularly.

In the pristine environment of Mount Shasta, they found aluminum concentrations of 61,000 ppm 60,000 times the toxic level according to Federal guidelines. Soil samples have shown drastic drops in soil microorganisms due to massive amounts of aluminum and barium affecting the pH of the soil. While normal crops are having difficulty growing in the altered soil, ""coincidentally"" corporations have been funding the development of GMO crops resistant to the aluminum in the soil. As they say... follow the money!

Air, soil and water samples show massive, toxic amounts of aluminum, barium and strontium that have escalated 50,000 % in five years!
Why should we be concerned? Heavy metals accumulate in biological systems, causing major neurological damage. Aluminum has been definitively linked with Alzheimer's. When Aluminum settles on trees, it causes unprecedentedly savage wildfires, because it is a fire accelerant. It builds up in the soil and has been killing off trees, from California redwoods to Hawaiian coconut trees.
Scientific communities around the world are dismayed at the irresponsibility of whoever is jeopardizing our health and our fragile ecosystems with clandestine climate modification programs, calling it reckless beyond belief. The cumulative effects, as one medical journalist observed, come down to three things: ""we're being dumbed down, made sicker and made infertile.""
Why is this being allowed? If people are using climate control over our heads, we need to know what is in it, what are the health consequences. We have the right to know everything, including who is paying for this.

Chemtrails are not conspiracy theory but conspiracy fact, and we are being deceived by our leaders. Members of Congress questioned by the filmmakers denied knowing anything about geoengineering, even though it was the subject of a Senate debate and tabled in a bill by Dennis Kucinich. When questioned about it in the halls of Congress, they ran from the camera like frightened rabbits.

The implications and ramifications are sinister, but the clock is ticking and we need to stay focused on the toxic effect of the aerospraying on the planet and on human health. At the end of the film, one of the Belgian scientists pointedly asks, ""What are we going to do about it? How are we going to stop it? I know the answer. It is up to you and me.""

It is a seminal work which not only changed my mind but has undoubtedly changed the minds of many others.  That's the point of activist media right?  That's what the situation calls for and Michael Murphy and his production team are accomplishing their objectives.

Michael Murphy and his co-creators should sleep well at night.  They have done the best they can in the face of an outrageous, over-the-top, ultra-massive global spraying initiative commonly known as 'geoengineering.'  This is not the easiest subject matter.  Most people are either unaware of this elephant in the room or don't want to be bothered with such unacceptable truths.

The corporate media presstitutes should be ashamed of themselves.  Rather than being justly inquisitive, their default position is one of protecting the status quo.  When information pointing to an incredibly huge domestic spraying operation is uncovered, they bury their heads in the sand; only emerging to cast aspersions upon those who have uncovered it.

""What in the World Are They Spraying"" embodies the spirit of the new media.  It is shocking, sleek, passionate, and factually correct journalism uncovering one of the greatest conspiracies of all time.",1473552000,,1310,5.27536231884058
