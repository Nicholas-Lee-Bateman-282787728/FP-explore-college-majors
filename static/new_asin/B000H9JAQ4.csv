2632369,5,B000H9JAQ4,"From the makers of 'Walking with Dinosaurs' comes this great special focusing on prehistoric sea monsters of all shapes and sizes - sea scorpions, placodonts, mososaurs, trilobites, arsionitherium, hesperornis and many others. Speaking as someone who grew up fascinated by dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures, especially marine reptiles, I have to say that I LOVED this special! Which is why I went out and bought it on DVD as soon as I found it out was available.

The basic premise of the show is that host Nigel Marven is traveling back in time on his ship, the Ancient Mariner, to visit the seven deadliest seas of all time! We start off in the Ordovician, where Marven encounters the gigantic orthocone and sea scorpions, then move on to the first marine reptiles in the Triassic. In the Devonian period, Nigel gets in a shark cage to go face to face with a dunkleosteus, a monstrous armored fish. Next up, the Eocene, where we meet the serpent-like whale basilosaurus. From there we go on to the Pliocene to see megalodon, a giant relative of the great white that feasted upon whales, and the Jurassic, home of marine crocodiles, sharks and pliosaurs. And the most dangerous sea of all time? The Cretaceous, where Nigel encounters elasmosaurs and giant mososaurs.

All in all, children (especially those who love dinosaurs) will get a blast out of this educational special. The CGI is brilliantly interspersed with some animatronics (like the tanystropheus tail or the giant trilobite Nigel picks up) making the show look more believable. And the information is up-to-date too. Unfortunately, there are no special features, but if you want to really impress the kids I'd recommend buying this disc alongside the book (of the same title) or with National Geographic's more recent special 'Sea Monsters: A Prehistoric Adventure'. Great for anyone who loves pleisosaurs, ichthyosaurs, mososaurs and other marine reptiles from prehistory or for fans of the TV show Primeval!",1222560000,3,1982,5.076687116564417
2632370,5,B000H9JAQ4,"This is a great video, for adults as well as kids. Note that The ""Chased by Dinosaurs"" DVD also contains the three episodes of ""Chased by Sea Monsters"".",1216252800,10,152,4.464285714285714
2632371,4,B000H9JAQ4,"Wow, this was so much more than the version they showed on TV in New Zealand, more monsters and most of all more dinosaurs!  Thanks for making the full version available.

Did anyone else pick all the scenes shot in the Hauraki Gulf, I'm glad all the megalodons have moved on.",1206662400,,276,4.392156862745098
2632372,5,B000H9JAQ4,"The CGI work on this was top notch.  The episodes were fun to watch and visually stunning.  The actors were believable, adding much to the build up of tension and enjoyability of the show.  In fact, I found myself holding my breath in places!  I highly recommend this DVD.  Well worth the money I spent on it.",1199836800,3,309,4.350877192982456
2632373,5,B000H9JAQ4,"Chased by Sea Monsters is actually three separate documentaries, which bring to life the most frightening and dangerous sea creatures of all time.

The amount of effort and research put into this project, along with the fantastic computer graphics, help transport the viewer to another time allowing one to lay eyes on creatures that have been extinct for millions of years.

Shot on location at sea, zoologist Nigel Marvel does a great job of presenting the actual setting for these magnificent and terrifying creatures, which are very well and very accurately portrayed.

The re-enactment throughout the documentaries added a nice touch and one really does get the feeling that they are there, in Hell's Aquarium....

Strongly recommended along with the Walking with Dinosaurs, Walking with Beasts and Walking with Cavemen series.  5 Stars",1180828800,,841,5.293233082706767
2632374,5,B000H9JAQ4,Movie covers a few creatures from seven different periods. Moves quick enough to keep a childs attention. Be aware that there are 2 or 3 times that one creature eats another so watch out for really young ones!!.Great attention paid to detail...You actually could beleive that he was there!!!,1173225600,3,291,4.959183673469388
8137759,5,B000H9JAQ4,one of my all time favorites.. wish it was re released on Blu Ray,1523059200,,65,3.7142857142857144
8137760,2,B000H9JAQ4,I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WASN'T THE BBC VERSION.  WAS EDITED TO CRAP... NOT HAPPY AT ALL,1478476800,,90,4.294117647058823
8137761,5,B000H9JAQ4,"I received this DVD from the mail and it had everything I could have ever anticipated--all the many sea creatures that existed so many millions of years ago.  It starts out in the Ordovician Period, then it goes to the Triassic Period.  When it takes us to the Devonian Period, we see the most dangerous animal that ever lived then--the Dunkleosteus.  It is 29' 3"" in length, and is seen swimming near a metal cage with a man in it.  Following this, the Eocene Period shows us the deadly whale that lived then, the 60' Basilosaurus.  Then when we're in the Pliocene Period, we see a huge shark--the dangerous (make that Dangerous) Charcharodon Megalodon, 49' 0"" in length!  Fortunately, they all survive this shark!  It is the ancestor of the great white shark.  The Jurassic Period shows us animals like Lipleurodon.  Finally, in the Cretaceous Period, we see animals like Hesperornis (sea birds 6' 6"" long), Elasmosaurus (some here are 46 feet long), and Archelon, a 12-foot-long turtle of the seas.  They also search for Tylosaurus.

In addition to all of this, there are some land animals we see, including:  Arsinotherium, a prehistoric mammal; a Coelurosaur; and Pteranodon, a pterosaur.

A very good DVD in MY book!",1439164800,,1222,4.845410628019324
8137762,5,B000H9JAQ4,"This is one of my favorite Discover/BBC collaborations and I'm so glad I was finally able to find it!  I'd originally ordered it from the Discovery Channel's website store a LONG time ago (I was stationed in Guam so between 2006 and 2009), but when I transferred back to the US, every single DVD, video game, all of my consoles, and half of my computer equipment was stolen from my household goods shipment, including this.

The show itself tickles my fancy in that Nigel really gives a good performance interacting with the ancient creatures.  The locations picked really feel primeval, almost primordial in the segments farthest back in time.  Having had a fascination with science fiction, dinosaurs, and marine paleontology most of my life, this really sold my interest.  I'm going to make sure this always stays in my collection.",1370736000,,834,4.928571428571429
8137763,5,B000H9JAQ4,this is very good resorce to learn and to understand natural history. if your kids also interested in natural history.,1359936000,,118,4.95
8137764,5,B000H9JAQ4,"From the makers of 'Walking with Dinosaurs' comes this, apparently the 4th in the Walking With series, which focuses on several past geological epochs and the prehistoric sea creatures of all shapes and sizes  from them - sea scorpions, placodonts, mosasaurs, trilobites, plesiosaurs, orthocone nautiloids, sharks and many others. As a degreed geologist with a long-time interest in palaeontology and early life forms who grew up in a region with Ordovician, Devonian and Carboniferous rock formations nearby, I have to say that I went out and bought it on DVD as soon as I was able to.

The basic premise of the show is that host Nigel Marven is traveling back in time (somehow) on his ship, the Ancient Mariner, to visit the seven deadliest seas of all time, in order of dangerousness! (never explains what mechanism is used to do so, I suppose we are to assume he jacked the engine and drive assembly from Dr. Who's tardis) We start off in the Ordovician, where Nigel encounters the gigantic orthocone nautiloids and sea scorpions, then moves on to the first marine reptiles in the Triassic. In the Devonian period, Nigel gets in a custom shark cage to go face to face with a dunkleosteus, a monstrous Dinicthyid armored fish. Then on to the Eocene, where we meet the serpent-like early whale basilosaurus. From there we go on to the Pliocene to see megalodon, a giant and possibly very close relative of the great white that feasted upon whales, and then the Jurassic, home of marine crocodiles, sharks and pliosaurs. And the most dangerous sea of all time? The Cretaceous, where Nigel encounters elasmosaurs, Xiphactinius which is for all intents and purposes a giant killer herring -- and several kinds of mosasaurs.

All in all, children (especially those who love dinosaurs) should enjoy this educational special. The CGI is brilliantly interspersed with some animatronics (like the tanystropheus tail, the giant trilobite and the Megalograptus sea scorpion Nigel picks up) making the show look more believable. And the information is up-to-date too. Unfortunately, there are no special features on this one, but as was suggested in another review if you want to really impress the kids you may also want to buying the book (of the same title). Great for anyone who loves marine palaeontology and/or marine reptiles from prehistory. Note: This programme may be a little bit intense for very young children, though not as upsetting to small children or sensitive viewers (like my GF) as certain parts of ""Walking with Monsters"" or ""Walking with Beasts"" where small animals were shown being hurt by predators.",1345161600,,2615,5.006896551724138
8137765,5,B000H9JAQ4,"Chased by sea monsters is a thrilling and fascinating exploration of the 7 deadliest oceans in history from the last half-billion years. The prehistoric monsters that lived in the oceans in different geological time periods like the jurassic,devonian,cretaceous,pliocene,eocene,triassic and ordovician. The marine reptiles like the mosasaurs and liopleurodon and giant sea scorpions and dunkleosteous(a 33ft.long armor plated fish),basilasaurus(a 65ft.long killer prehistoric whale) and the giant shark megalodon are brought to life in incredible and unbelievable realism as well as their ancient environments. The ""hell`s aquarium"" in the cretaceous period is the most dangerous with a variety of marine reptiles and 20ft.long killer fish. The red time-line that Nigel Marvin travels to each time period is very interesting and shows the vast amount of time and different eras and ages these sea monsters lived in. This dvd is educational as well as fun to watch for children and adults.",1298246400,3,988,5.6824324324324325
8137766,5,B000H9JAQ4,"Nigel Marven has another hit.  Chased by Sea Monsters is a computer graphics lovers dream.  But there is so much more to this DVD.  Nigel gets right in the water with gigantic, ancient fish and reptiles.  Well he doesn't actually, but with the computer graphics on this DVD it seems so real.  Nigel tackles the seven deadliest of prehistoric earth.  In the first sea he meets up with non-poisonous (but still dangerous)sea scorpions.  There are armor-plated fish in the Devioian period, the whale eating shark(yes there were sharks bigger that whales)called Megalodon, which means 'big tooth', which is an understament!!!  Nigel even has a few death defying moments, especially when he hitches a ride on the back of a huge sea turtle in, what he calls, ""Hells Aquarium"".  There is a little information about what is going on on the land and in the air but it is what's in the sea that really can be quite terrifying. You may never look at your goldfish in the same loving way again.",1279065600,3,982,4.695906432748538
8137767,5,B000H9JAQ4,"I'm a big fan of dinosaurs and of Nigel Marvin. His exuberance is contagious as he has no problem imagining that he's surrounded by prehistoric sea monsters. The show follows Marvin and his crew as they 'travel' through seven of the most deadliest oceans Earth has ever known. The sea monsters are incredibly realistic as excellently rendered cg and detailed props are combined and used to great effect. Unlike the National Geographic Sea Monsters dvd, Chased By Sea Monsters offers a much greater variety of creatures and more educational content. I fully recommend this dvd for children and adults alike.",1255305600,,606,5.07
8137768,5,B000H9JAQ4,"I bought this DVD not realizing it was a part of the Chased By Dinosaurs series, and paid $30 for a 45 minute episode.  Then I realized the entire series (on 1 disc) was about the same price and was a little mad, although I really wasn't into the dinosaur episodes (rented on Netflix after all this happened) - I'm mostly into sea animals myself - so it wasn't TOO big a deal.

Fantastic graphics - when I first caught part of this on tv, my sister and I were unsure as to whether or not it was real!  AND, Nigel Marvin, the zoologist hosting these shows, is an actual zoologist that works out in the field, not just an actor with computerized dinosaurs, which makes it doubly cool.

Two thumbs up, fascinating, exciting and informative :)  I bought the CBD series for a few other people as presents and they were thrilled!",1244419200,,823,4.352941176470588
