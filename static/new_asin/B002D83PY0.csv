8364915,4,B002D83PY0,"Not bad.
First disc contains one of the none-budget South American films Karloff made at the tail-end of his career; one never-seen pot-boiler from the mid-5o's; and one Corman opus from the early 6o's, notoriously shot in 3 days on a left-over set from a previous production.

~ 'Snake People' is terrible, but really entertaining. A shades-donned Karloff lords it over a terrifying mess of undead farm labourers and voodoo priestesses, repugnant midgets and headless chickens .. But then a Kate O'Mara-lookalike with a Peck/Ahab white streak does a provocative snake-dance and all is well.

~ 'Island Monster' is just terrible. Except for awful, out-of-synch dubbing, nothing happens for what seems like hours, then everyone's on an island and there's no monster. Come to think of it, there's no island, just some sea.
Karloff is a vile child kidnapper being chased by heroic men of the hour. He's got an impersonator doing his voice, but with a cockney accent similar to those of the supporting characters in the Basil Rathbone/Sherlock Holmes thrillers from the 194o's.

~ 'The Terror' is terrible, but really colourful, incoherent and fun. Karloff is an old nobleman in a crumbling, shaky (literally !) castle. Nothing much happens, but then a pretty 'ghost' haunts Jack Nicholson  - who's already spent half the film mugging untidily - and makes his face go even more OTT.
Corman was so excited to be making the ultimate quickie, he forgot to shoot it in CinemaScope, so old clever-clogs Leonard Maltin's got it wrong in his smug guide.
In the title credits, Francis Ford Coppola is associate producer and Monte Hellman is location manager ~ but along with Nicholson, they all direct various bits. Which is quite a big deal for a quickie.

Second disc is ten episodes of a nifty TV series Karloff made in the late 5o's; presenting and featuring in the episodes, which are slight, well-cast dramas with a supernatural edge. Apparently, the series is rare (I've never heard of it), and has got fans drooling. Deservedly. It's very good.

A properly smart Karloff collection if you're a fan of the fabulous man (and let's face it, who isn't !?), to be bought and looked at a few times.",1509580800,,2188,4.9

The three movies (Island Monster, Snake People, the Terror) are in most horror megapacks, and aren't anything to write home about (of course, being public domain, they never will be).",1435104000,,281,4.423076923076923

Mr. Karloff is really a great actor and all of his unforgettable characters that he plays so well.,1418169600,,268,4.235294117647059

8364923,5,B002D83PY0,"I would agree with the other reviewers who say the movies included here are not Karloff's best work; I would say not even in the top 15 myself, but it is nice to have the complete series of The Veil included.  This series was a couple of years before ""Thriller"" premiered and are half hour episodes.  Good work and well worth seeing.  As for the movies, The Terror has little plot but is Ok.  I haven't made it through Snake People yet, but it doesn't get high marks anywhereI  have read reviews of it so I don't hold out much hope.",1313107200,2,532,4.227722772277228
