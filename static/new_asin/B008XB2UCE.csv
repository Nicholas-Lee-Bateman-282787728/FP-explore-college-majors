5188926,5,B008XB2UCE,the realness of new york the gritty black and white the storylines without things blowing up or people running around aimlesslyl looking for someone to kill this is a real treat  especailly for native new yorkers who can recongnize landmarks buildings etc of a new york long gone. the charactors are real people not  reved up testerone super slick cops and robbers but real stories about real situations,1362182400,,403,4.911764705882353
5188927,4,B008XB2UCE,"At a glance, it would appear there won't be any episodes in this box set that weren't in the Image releases of several years ago. As a ""Naked City"" lover, I got each of those volumes as they were released, I have kept them all, and I do rewatch them from time to time.

Disappointing if you're like me and have wished for a complete series set, or at least the complete hour-long episodes. I would buy them all over again if they were part of a complete set (hear me, Madacy?)

That said, this set does look like a great deal for the price if you don't have these already. Four stars for the content. Very highly recommended ... a great slice of early 1960s attitudes and styles. Thoughtful dramas, terrific looking on-location scenes in New York City, inspiring music by Billy May and Nelson Riddle ...",1348704000,50,803,4.418918918918919

5188929,5,B008XB2UCE,"As a kid, I somehow missed this series. Probably watching Superman instead. But, being a film noir fan, I thought I would take a chance on this set. WOW! I was knocked out. The tranfers are crsip and clean, and you get 40 of the one hour episodes, that aired from 1960 thru 1963. But, what is most astonishing, is the staggering amount of guest stars that appeared in this series, when they were in their youth! Martin Sheen, Jon Voight, Robert Duvall, James Coburn, Carroll O'Connor, Jack Klugman, Gene Hackam, even a very young Christopher Walken, credited as Ronnie Walken, and many more! Each episode is a treat! The only negative thing for me was Nancy Malone's character, who played Paul Burke's characters love interest. I found her character quite annoying, as she was always trying to take him away from his police work. Kind of went against the grain of the seriousness of the series. But all in all, a great series worth discovering and rediscovering. And for the current price, I highly recommend it! Oh, and don't let the somewhat bulky packaging turn you off. Open up the outer box, and you get 2 regular sized DVD boxes, that fit nicely with your other
 box sets.",1436313600,,1178,4.636363636363637

5188931,4,B008XB2UCE,"Some of the most renown screenwriters (Sterling Silliphant, Howard Rodman,) of the 50s and 60s wrote scripts for this series. Also, well known and respected directors were used for Naked City. The shows can be nostalgic, for us who grew up in the 50s. As I watch the them, I recall the actors who  were in the prime of their acting careers when they were in the Naked City. People like Tuesday Weld, Rip Torn, Robert Loggia, and many others were in the shows. It was a gritty series, focusing quite a bit on the drama of the lives of the people, as well as the police procedural elements.",1428019200,,588,4.394495412844036

5188935,4,B008XB2UCE,"I enjoyed the ""Best of Naked City"" DVD. However, I later purchased seasons 1-2 and found out that ""best"" is  subjective. I thought that many episodes were in fact better than those considered in ""The Best of Naked City"". My only other observation is not based upon the quality of the series itself. As a native New Yorker, it is very distressing today to see how few African-Americans stories were highlighted.  I believe I saw an episode with Diahann Carroll. There was no absence of white stars from every aspect of show business. I really enjoyed seeing them during their prime years.  Unfortunately, it appears that the masses of black stars were overlooked and excluded.  Worse,  the lives of black New Yorkers  were also greatly ignored and diminished.  With this off my chest, I believe ""The Best of Naked City"" is worth attention.",1420934400,,838,4.818181818181818
5188936,5,B008XB2UCE,"This program was ahead of its time when first broadcast. There are 40 episodes in this package from 1960,61 and 62. The picture, although in black and white, is crystal clear with perfect sound. The people who put this package together have done a marvellous job in presentation and packaging. When viewing  these programs one has to put themselves in the context of the times but you can't help but enjoy seeing stars such as Robert Duval, Gene Hackman, Martin Sheen and Dustin Hoffman get their great carreers going with their roles on these episodes. Like other cop shows like LAW AND ORDER or NYPD BLUE, New York is the backdrop for NAKED CITY as well. I throughly enjoyed watching these programs as I am sure you will.

5188940,4,B008XB2UCE,"Format for selecting individual episodes is difficult, compared to popular series such as MASH.  Fun part in watching series is the youthful stars who went on to bigger things.  Stories are good with easy to comprehend plots.  Would recommend to all who wish to watch early television with excellent dialogue and plots.  Today's are so much in your face violence and vulgarity.",1402704000,,377,5.032258064516129
5188941,3,B008XB2UCE,"I remember my parents watching these when I was a kid on their old black and white RCA television.  Only had one channel we could get at the time.  Channel 9 KGUN, out of Tucson, Arizona.  A video document of time gone by.  The attitudes, dress, actions of a lost era.  Stories are much the same as now, without the sex, etc. that plague our society now.  Gave it three stars because disk #3 is defective and I am just getting around to watch them.  Can't return them now.",1400803200,3,472,4.235955056179775
5188942,5,B008XB2UCE,"Great show from the Black & White TV past. These DVD's were flawless and played well. Excellent video & audio. The first few discs didn't seem to have an Episode index, but the last 7 or 8 discs did. 10 DVD's in all. Great crime stories, set in NYC with lots of stars and big names of the 1960's era. Loved all the old cars in the scenes. Plenty of older Pontiac's, used as Police Cars, but all the other makes and models of the 1960's were in attendance also. To Me, New York City and older (classic) cars make these DVD's a plus.",1392595200,5,531,4.115384615384615
5188943,5,B008XB2UCE,Excellent 1950's-1960's TV drama starring Paul Burke. Series out of public eye far too long. I have the box set you see here. The quality is excellent. Best news of all is that entire series is now out on DVD.,1392508800,,209,4.25
5188944,4,B008XB2UCE,Even in black and white the shows were good.  Not quite the quality we have in production these days but still entertaining.,1392076800,,124,4.636363636363637

5188946,5,B008XB2UCE,"""Naked City"" is one of the best dramas ever produced for television. I remember growing up as a child watching it with my parents. Although too young to understand the stories, there was something about it that intrigued me. Now as a baby boomer I can fully appreciate the style of this dramatic series. Filmed on location in the streets of New York City with bystanders, onlookers, passersby, and grime (over flowing trash cans, littered sidewalks, demolished buildings, debris, construction sites, overgrown weeds, and vacant lots). Realistic stories about regular, everyday people in raw, untouched, settings. Each story unfolded at a comfortable pace with character development focused on one or just a few characters. Simplistic story telling that was easy to follow. The endings were not always happy, but they were always satisfying. Even the ""Naked City"" opening/closing theme should be ranked among the top television opening/closing themes in classic television history. An unexpected bonus is the special features section that is not listed anywhere on the packaging. The packaging itself is noteworthy made entirely of sturdy paper cardboard, except maybe the white buttons to hold the discs in place. The special features which consists of original commercial spots from the early 60's, are located on discs 4, 5, 9, and 10. Two options are available to watch them separately or watch them as a group. I enjoyed watching the commercials as much as the episodes. A host of Hollywood Stars appeared in the series. One of my favorite episodes stars Diahann Carroll. The episode is ""A Horse Has A Big Head-Let Him Worry! However the big star of this episode is a little boy. His story will leave you a little teary eyed with a warm feeling inside.  Through the decades I have seen many good television dramas including some of those currently televised. There are many other great television dramas of the 60's. ""Naked City"" is one of the best of them. As the credits roll to an end, the ""Seal of Good Practice"" is displayed. I can't remember the last time, last year, or even last decade (post 60's) that symbol was displayed at the end of any television program. Television programming is not what it used to be.",1383177600,3,2223,4.975806451612903
5188947,4,B008XB2UCE,"A very good deal!  Well written and acted, providing a nice sense of closure in each episode.  Film noir is really what this is all about.",1381968000,,138,4.269230769230769
5188948,5,B008XB2UCE,"This show is so good I really don't know what to say.  Every episode is like watching a 50 minute Film Noir Classic.  It's all about the scumbags, the low-lifes, the bottom-feeders, etc.  Each one is entirely different.  The prints have been remastered for a fabulous viewing experience.  Also, this show was shot on LOCATION in New York -- not the studio backlot.  Get it now while you still can.  A+ all the way!!",1376006400,,415,4.527027027027027
5188949,5,B008XB2UCE,"I got the opportunity to watch a few of these shows on tv late one night and I have been hooked ever since.  I so love the classic (black & white) noire style setting and the characters.  Mostly all of the episodes have a moral to them.  If you like the old school detective shows, minus the high level of violence and gore that you see in a lot of shows and movies today, then I think you really appreciate Naked City.  Would give it 10 stars, if I could. :o)",1375747200,,460,4.021978021978022

5188951,5,B008XB2UCE,This is a top package. From Peter Falk's death in the first 10 minutes to a series of well-structured storylines in NY in gritty black and white it is the perfect way to see this classic.,1372550400,,187,4.222222222222222
5188952,5,B008XB2UCE,"This set is wonderful, was too young to watch when it first come on in the early 60s but the story lone are great. So is the acting in it. DVD set on time and in perfect shape. The packaging is awesome. Would recommend this set to anyone, and also the Seller.",1371513600,,259,4.0
5188953,5,B008XB2UCE,"Most of these episodes are pretty good; and reflect an almost surreal image of the culture of the early 60s where shoot-outs in broad daylight in the streets of New York are incredible. Though the precinct used as the home base is supposed to be in Manhattan, the courthouse in the Bronx is more commonly portrayed.

If you are very familiar with New York and you enjoy crime drama of the early 60s AND if you are interested in urban (or specifically New York) culture of that time, you will LOVE these.  On the other hand, if you are interested in researching about that time in New York history, this is quite useful.

You can select to have the episodes commercially interrupted, but you can view them separately as a bonus feature.  There are only about three commercials per episode and they are approximately one minute in duration.

The price cannot be beat.",1370908800,,865,4.627450980392157

5188956,5,B008XB2UCE,I grew up with this TV series circa 1960. It's as good as I remembered it. Great film noir from the golden age of TV. It's based on the classic 1948 film. It's fun to see future movie and TV stars before they were known. An excellent buy at 40 shows and nearly 40 hours. It puts the current crime shows to shame. Don't miss it!,1367452800,,327,3.9696969696969697
5188957,5,B008XB2UCE,"When I look back, the Naked City does appear a bit corny by today's standards, yet there is something innocent and refreshing about it. I grew up in an Ozzie and Harriet world, and Naked City takes me back there.",1366934400,,212,4.325
5188958,5,B008XB2UCE,"Based upon a 1948 movie with Barry Fitzgerald,  this series is GREAT and likely underatted.  Filmed on location and pushes human interest which I think it brilliant.  Goes beyond mere crime drama.  High class and attracted excellent actors/actresses who later became big.  I particularly loved the episode, ""A Horse Has a Big Head - Let Him Worry!"" with Diahann Caroll about a kid with low vision, roaming streets of New York (included in this set and is priceless).  Film quality is excellent. This set has 40 episodes.
BTW, the 1948 movie is also brilliant and worth purchasing and watching,  particularly if you're a senior.",1365552000,7,627,4.971153846153846
5188959,5,B008XB2UCE,"This series was a groundbreaking police procedural that caught the eye of many a critic in the early 1960s.  Many fine actors such as Dustin Hoffman and Robert Duvall got started in this show, which often concentrated more on the guest stars than on star Paul Burke.
This is a fine collection of shows, well mastered, clear video and sound quality.",1365206400,,348,4.704918032786885
5188960,5,B008XB2UCE,"Having bought this box set and the other current 20 episode release this now brings it up to 65 different episodes of this series that I now own on dvd. I have clear memories of watching this terrific show on the freezing cold nights of winter,1963 in below zero Britain. The memories of the stark wintry New York streets stuck in my mind, and I made a pledge to see them for myself someday. I realised that dream in 1997 and have been back seven further times since. The clarity of the pictures on these 50 year old episodes has to be seen to be believed. The three main characters look and behave in an utterly believable manner. This set and any others that you can get a hold of are a MUST BUY!!!! Amazon have certainly delivered!!",1364774400,3,735,4.333333333333333
5188961,4,B008XB2UCE,"Naked City was one of the best TV dramas ever, and it's unfortunate that Image Entertainment took so long to release these episodes (2012). If you were 45 at the time the series was on the air, you're dead now! There are two basic types of NC shows: ""Cops and Robbers"" and ""Psycobabble,"" where the writers decided to focus on the ""deep thoughts and fears"" of some of the bad guys. There are both kinds here and the former is much more enjoyable, especially when McMahon is in the scene, grinding up the scenery with barked instructions and cynicism. NYC is also a star with its grit and reality.
Far less enjoyable are the troubled miscreant shows that often are plodding and tedious. One has two friends from the old country that are forever yapping at one another and then have fist fights over and over again - this for 53 minutes or so. Please. Also awkward is the use of Libby (Nancy Malone) Detective Flint's girlfriend - they're always smooching it up, even in the station, and often you think she's running the 65th Precinct.
The guest stars are remarkable; you'll see such eventual screen luminaries as Dustin Hoffman, Robert Duvall, Walter Matthau, Ed Asner, Dennis Hopper (crazy even then), Burt Reynolds, Martin Sheen, Gene Hackman, William Shatner, Carroll O'Conner, etc.
With all that said, and so long as Amazon keeps their current price, you're paying 59 cents for each program - how can you go wrong?!",1364688000,3,1418,4.721774193548387
5188962,5,B008XB2UCE,"I never purchased any of the earlier sets, so I am not deducting any fractions of a star simply because this set offers no newly-released episodes.  By the the time I got into this show - and I did so in a big way - all of those earlier sets were seemingly out of print and fetching big money.  So I was very happy to see the release of this set.  This is a great show, and these are quality reproductions.  I really lke the packaging too, which is original and heavy-duty.  And finally, the price on Amazon for 40 episodes on ten DVD's was/is fantastic.  If you like this show half as much as I do, you will not regret purchasing this set.",1364601600,,640,4.120967741935484

The presentation is as follows: two albums of 20 episodes, most featuring new or up-and-coming stars, each with episode title, synopsis, episode photo, guest stars, writer/director and air date info. For me, this package comes in at the number one best value in TV DVD deals, at $12.05 NEW. Even if you were not a dedicated fan when it first aired, the stories and characters are diverse enough to make each an enjoyable experience. As with other hour-long shows of that era (1959-64), the stories run about 51 minutes, (most commercial series are now about 44 minutes). Police procedures and laws were different in that era...they actually kept bad guys off the streets for more than 2 years.
