711238,3,6303696929,"Well, the sequel to the mega-hit, FW. It's not all you'll anticipate.
The plot's better. The boy must help the freed fish find his way home. But oil spills complicate things.
The acting... ughsh... the plot... double ughsh... the directing... WHAT DIRECTING?!... All in all, the video doesn't have any sense. Don't waste your pretty penny.",1009756800,,339,5.071428571428571
711239,3,6303696929,"I have to ask some of the people who RAVED about this movie if they actually were awake during the whole thing...
The computer generated graphics can not compare to real whales, sorry.  I'm a big fan of computer generated images, but not this time.
The story is stretched to levels of disbelief that I didn't believe imaginable.
It's not horrible, but it's not as good as the first movie.
Kids will love it more than adults, that's for sure.
The subject matter is great.  I love a good eco/bio movie any day but it could have been done better.
The little bit of budding romance was actually done reasonably well.
Net:  I own it, only cuz the wife bought it.  I wouldn't have.  I've seen it twice, but other than that, it's tough to get through it without laughing.  I know, I'm probably much too critical on this one, but hey, sometimes ya just gotta say ""YO.""
You might want to rent it before you think about buying it.",970790400,4,920,4.382352941176471
711240,5,6303696929,"Who cares if it is CGI and modelled, this film is great. In my opinion the best animal film ever made, and I reckon it captures just perfectly the magic surrounding orcas  which captivates everyone who meets one. I have to  admit I've been swept away in it, and that probably influences my review,  but the thing that made this film for me was its serious and believable  reality/fantasy borderline which the first film paved the way for. Very few  people in the world have an endearing relationship with an animal such as a  4 tonne top predator, but I know it is actually possible, and that makes  the film yards ahead of the rest in it's realism scale. On a more  professional note, the character interaction is good, even without Willy  and co. Particularly interesting, I think, is the idea of Elvis being  pushed to one side by his family until it turns out he can be of use. BUY  THIS FILM, LOVE IT, ....",967939200,,911,4.427710843373494
711241,5,6303696929,"This movie is great. It's got a small life-threatening love story with action, and that *really* gets my attention. It has side-troubles [Jesse and Elvis's brother problems], and it has Action. My favorite action scene  is where they are lifting Jessee from the ocean as he was sinking..then he  slipped and fell back into the ocean, and Nadine was so upset. It just  excites me. I love this movie, an those who say it stunk :P I liked it.

711242,4,6303696929,"Sure, everyone is going to make fun of Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home because everyone thinks Willy got home, right? No way! This movie is way rad, better than the original. Although it is a bit predictable (and  silly), it has a strong plot, young love, that same 'save the whales'  message, the cute Jason James Richter, and real suspense at the end.  We  learn that an older, girl-crazy Jesse (Richter) has a little brother  (Elvis) that must come stay with the Greenwoods (Annie and Glen, Jesse's  foster family)  after Jesse's biological mom dies. You'll probably remember  that in Free Willy Jesse was looking for his mom. Anyway, they all go  camping and visit Randolph (the Native American guy that worked at the  Whale Park and helped to free Willy). Jesse sees Willy for the first time  in years (calling him with the harmonica tune from the original) and meets  Nadiene, Randolph's God-daughter. She shares a love of orcas, and all is  well until there is a terrible oil spill threatening Willy and his family.  But thats not all! Feeling neglected, Elvis runs away but overhears the oil  company owner's plans for Willy and his family-to catch and sell them.  Then, while Jesse, Elvis and Nadiene are helping the whales to safety, the  oil spill catches fire and they are nearly killed.
The acting is a  little, well, over-the-top, but it's a great movie. It features another  Michael Jackson song and Jesse with his harmonica and guitar. You will dig  it, no matter what age. It's my favorite movie and I'm 16! (also check out  Free Willy 3: The Rescue)",948931200,,1568,4.712177121771218

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

Jesse (Jason James Richter) is a few years older now, and so is Willy. As the story opens, Jesse gets word that his mother recently died in New York, and he has an 8-year-old half brother. Elvis (Francis Capra) comes to live with Jesse and his foster parents, and of course at first the boys hate each other.

Their foster parents, Annie and Glen Greenwood (Jayne Atkinson and Michael Madsen), take them on a camping trip to go visit with Randolph Johnson (August Schellenberg), who is now running a research and whale-spotting boat of his own. He has his pretty goddaughter Nadine (Mary Kate Schellhardt) with him. She's about the same age as Jesse, so the inevitable romance is part of the story.

Willy has found his pod, with his mother and sister and brother. His sister is called Luna because she has a crescent-shaped white spot on her dorsal fin, and their little brother is called Little Spot for equally obvious reasons. Willy is still recognizable by his curved dorsal fin, which never did straighten out. Randolph and Nadine discover Willy out with his pod, and bring Jesse and Willy together.

But things get sticky -- literally -- when a single-hull tanker runs aground nearby and spills crude oil. Luna gets some of the oil in her lungs, and might die if she won't accept help. But that wasn't trouble enough; the oil spill catches fire.

Elvis, who started out as a royal pain in the butt and a chronic liar, is really the star of this one in some ways. He turns into a pretty appealing kid eventually, but I won't spoil it by telling you how this miracle is achieved.",1336608000,4,1748,4.607717041800643
712169,4,6303696929,"We all know the movie is great. I've seen it again just last week after over 15 years and it still influences my love to Orcas. The only thing I want to say here, because there is a picture of the VHS PLUS pendant from a costumer - I ordered it because I once threw away my pendant (thought I need to seperate to grow up) and wanted one again. Because of the picture I assumed this order has the pendant in it but it doesn't! So if you are seeking for the extra - like me - you'll need to find it somewhere else.",1298937600,,512,3.8857142857142857

This remains one of the best movies I have ever seen. I wish all movies could be like this one.",1286496000,,117,4.363636363636363
712171,5,6303696929,"How many times has a part 2 or part 3 of a movie leave you wishing you had only seen the first one?  It is not this way with Free Willy 2 and Free Willy 3. Both movies were able to continue on with the main theme and the main actors from Free Willy #1.  The show just picked up where it left off and both were really enjoyable.  The show also was able to slide in some knowledge of orcas into the show and left you feeling like you could have starred in the movie too.  I'd advise anyone who enjoyed the first Free Willy to see the other two.  I have not seen the last one .  It does not have the same characters in it, but I'll give it a chance.",1272153600,,646,3.783582089552239
712172,5,6303696929,"Jesse becomes reunited with Willy three years after the whale's jump to freedom as the teenager tries to rescue the killer whale and other orcas from an oil spill. This movie is just as good as the original. This movie also differs from the first movie, in the fact that it shows willy with his family, it shows orcas in a pod, and it shows their relationship as a family. If you want the excitement and thrilling adventure that you got in the first movie, see this movie.",1262908800,,472,4.375
712173,5,6303696929,"Hello. Remember my review of Free Willy last month? Next, I am going to review the sequel, Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home. Picking up two years after the first film, Jesse (Jason James Richter) and his foster parents Glen (Michael Madsen) and Annie (Jayne Atkinson) learn from Dwight (Mykelti Willamson) that Jesse's mother who abandoned him eight years before died in New York City, leaving him devastated. They also learn that Jesse has a half-brother Elvis (Francis Capra) who is prone to telling lies and annoying Jesse. The entire family went on a camping trip where they are reunited with Randolph (August Shellenberg) and the two go on a whale watching ride where Jesse meets Randolph's goddaughter Nadine (Mary Kate Schellhardt) and the group reunite with Willy (Keiko) and his siblings, Luna and Little Spot. Jesse and Nadine start to show feelings for each other. An oil tank nearby scrapes on an underwater rock and spills oil all over the area and Luna, Willy's sister gets covered in the oil, a small amount of which gets in her lungs. After the group heals Luna and tries to clean the oil spill, the social worker who claims to be protecting the whales is really plotting to ship them off to an amusement park and were exposed by Jesse and Elvis. Unfortunately, the oil tanker explodes and sets the spill on fire which leads to a death defying situation then the three get trapped by the flames. A helicopter rescues Nadine and Elvis, but Jesse falls back into the water and Willy comes to the rescue, again. In the end, Jesse learns to accept Elvis for who he is despite his annoying ways, and Elvis becomes more honest and tells Jesse that although their mother had to abandon him, she still loved him and bitterly regretted not being able to care for him. This helps Jesse move on and Willy and his siblings were reunited with their mother. This entry teaches a powerful lesson to oil companies to always use two layers of metal for the bottom in order to prevent an oil spill. Most of the main cast returned for this sequel with some newcomers, especially a new director, Dwight H. Little (that's right, the director of Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Meyers). All this makes it the most serious of the franchise and definitely the best. I am surprised it faced competition with Batman Forever and only performed half as well as its predecessor in the U.S. box office. If you see this at a video store, I would check it out.",1249430400,,2447,4.640552995391705
