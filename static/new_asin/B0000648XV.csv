1706821,5,B0000648XV,"Jon Else's Oscar-nominated documentary is a gem. He tells the story of the creation of the first atomic bomb, through the story of the amazing man who was picked to head up the project. J. Robert Oppenheimer would be a renaissance man in any time, but his presence during WWII and the Cold War afterwards, and his own doomed role in these world history events, makes him a tragic hero. Intelligent beyond comprehension, literate, poetic, charming, and dedicated (both to science and humanity), the experience of WWII's horror diverted his life on a collision course with history. Else's film is poignant, touching, restrained, and ultimately moving. Made in 1979, he was fortunate to be able to interview many of ""Oppie's"" colleagues, friends, and his brother Frank (who started another, lesser-known revolution, in interactive ""museums,"" with his Exploratorium in San Francisco; WGBH's Nova series did a show on it). They all give us insight into the man, the scientist, the devotee of poetry, as well as the time in which these erudite engineers and scientists came together to build the ultimate weapon. Also of note, at the time of release, THE DAY AFTER TRINITY featured recently discovered, previously unseen footage of the Trinity test.

If you have children, or friends, who have only passing knowledge of the Atomic Age, and the effect it had on history, you deserve to own a copy of this classic film. It's instructive, but it is quietly passionate. You can't watch this and not be effected emotionally. That's the highest praise I can give a film. See this film...!",1118102400,107,1576,4.992395437262357

1706823,5,B0000648XV,"The Day After Trinity, the story of the making and firing of the first atomic bomb, tells in stark, factual interviews the story of the Faustian bargain we made with atomic energy. Tracing the steps taken by our  government and leading scientists and focusing on J. Robert Oppenheimer, it  is a compelling, riveting story of personal ambition, scientific  curiousity, and tragic regret. The martyrdom of Oppenheimer is particularly  well-told. Combining the American ""can-do"" spirit, the  philosopher/scientist elite, World War II militarism, and Mc-Carthyism, it  is a compelling guide to understanding for anyone interested in the 1950s.",917740800,21,639,5.604166666666667

1706860,5,B0000648XV,"The Bottom Line:

The Day After Trinity (which incidentally would make a great companion piece to The Atomic Cafe) is an interesting and exceptionally insightful documentary about the creation of the atomic bomb which features your standard collection of talking head interviews and archive footage but the quality and depth of the material belies the stale set-up; if you're at all interested in the subject matter, watch this film.

1706862,4,B0000648XV,"I viewed this film after I watched the BBC series ""Oppenheimer"" and I must say that I didn't really learn much from it that I didn't get from the BBC series. It was interesting to see what the characters we saw in the series really look like, and I must say, the BBC series worked very hard to get actors who looked like the people they were portraying, especially Hughes, Hans Bethe and Frank Oppenheimer.
Unfortunately, unlike the BBC series, this film does not go into the various technical problems the development of the A-Bomb encountered.  Those involved in the project all pointed out how Oppenheimer was able to understand the various disciplines involved in building the bomb (physics, pyrotechnics, electronics, communications, shock waves, etc) and thus he was able to focus in on the best way to solve the various technical problems encountered.
One thing I found interesting is the fact that the film left in Haakon Chevalier's devastating critique of Oppenheimer where he says Oppenheimer was lying when he said the Chevalier had approached him with George Eltenton's proposal to transfer information on the Bomb to the Soviets.  Chevalier emphatically denied that he supported this idea, saying only the national leaders could make such a decision, whereas the BBC series simply shows us a meeting in Oppenheimer's kitchen where the matter was discussed, but we are not told what was really said.  The fact is that Oppenheimer maintained his friendship with Chevalier and he even visited him in Europe during the 1950's when the accusations against Oppenheimer were being loudly proclaimed.
It would have been very interesting to see Edward Teller, who in the hearings convened to determine whether Oppenheimer's security clearance should be revoked said he did not doubt Oppenheimer's loyalty but he did question his judgment, although it is reported that Teller spoke more harshly against him in early, closed meetings on the matter.  It is too bad we don't see him in this film to hear how he perceived things 30 years later.

Finally, there is the famous question about whether it was necessary or moral to use the Bomb on the Japanese.  Hughes says he is still troubled by the matter and that after Germany was defeated they should have stopped working on the bomb. Freeman Dyson says it was only used out of ""bureaucratic inertia"".  Apparently these men forgot that a bloody war was being fought in the Pacific and that, contrary to the myths of the time this film was being made, they were NOT on the verge of surrender. Even if the US had not carried out an invasion of the Japanese Home Islands and had been willing to carry out a tight blockade for several months, far more Japanese would have died of hunger, disease and possible civil disorder. In addition, 100,000 Chinese were dying every month, so those who express concern for the Japanese civilians killed by the bomb (which is understandable) seem to forget the other Japanese civilians who would have starved to death or the civilians of the countries under Japanse occupation who were dying also, in addition to the Allied Prisoners-of-War (See Richard Frank's book ""Downfall"" for a full discussion of the matter).",1220486400,13,3200,4.947858472998138

1706884,5,B0000648XV,"The BBC released the great mini-series ""Oppenheimer"" on Region Two DVD format last year.

This great mini-series is still felt to be the best re-creation on film of the people and events leading up to the explosions of the atomic bombs in August 1945. A young SAM WATERSTON plays Oppenheimer brilliantly.

It took years for the BBC to decide to release the series in DVD format, and then it was only in Region Two (PAL), the format used in the UK.

You'd think that they'd release it on Region One (US format), given the fact thatit starts Sam Waterson. However, it has not yet been released in the US.

The three-disc series, which also stars a brilliant David Suchet as Edward Teller, is available thru Amazon in the UK (www.amazon.co.uk) and on eBay in the UK ([...]) for about $22.00 plus shipping.

Multi-format players are available in the US. It is my understanding that they have to be hacked to play other formats than Region 1,? due to licensing restrictions. I purchased an inexpensive player on eBay (US), which with shipping cost $50.00. The supplier provided the easy instructions to adapt it to Region Two format.

It is worth going to all of this effort to view again this great mini-series, which was virtually ignored in the US when it was shown here, but which remains unrivaled for both its acting and its accurate re-creation of the events surrounding Oppenheimer, his downfall, and the creation of the atomic age.",1189209600,2,1435,4.742971887550201
1706885,5,B0000648XV,"The Day After Trinity is an excellent documentary about Robert Oppenheimer and the development of the atom bomb.  The interviews of famous scientists who worked at Los Alamos are remarkable in themselves.  The film poses questions about the ethics of nuclear armaments, and the relationship between science and politics in weapons development and deployment.  Every American should see it.",1188691200,9,389,5.559322033898305
1706886,5,B0000648XV,"Nice piece on fervor that surrounded the Manhattan Project.  Interesting human interest story of how thousands of people worked for years designing the most powerful weapon ever, but didn't realize the consequences on dropping one in a city full of people, until they see it go off in the desert.",1182902400,4,296,4.92
1706887,3,B0000648XV,"I got this DVD after having read Richard Rhodes's ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" and ""Dark Sun"".  Plus, I had grown up from childhood reading a lot of other books about the making of the atomic bomb.

I had even seen that famous clip of Robert Oppenheimer before, in grade school, a long, long time ago, in an educational movie about the making of the atomic bomb, where he says:

""....We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, ""Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" I suppose we all thought that one way or another....""

And so I got this DVD, hoping to learn more, about that interview, about Robert J. Oppenheimer, etc.

But NOOOOO.....This DVD turns out to be mostly a series of talking head interviews of a number of the more junior (at the time) physicists involved in the Manhatten Project.  Several of them, especially Robert Wilson, speak of their horror and their early opposition to further development and use of the atomic bomb.  Almost all of them speak of Robert Oppenheimer, and reminisce about the many conflicts and contradictions of Oppenheimer.

But that's all there is to this DVD.  It does not fully explain the contradictions in the life of Robert Oppenheimer, nor how the course of events post-WWII played out that led to Oppenheimer losing his security clearance.  It doesn't even explain the setting of that famous Oppenheimer interview quote.  A video clip of that famous quote, by the way, can be found online if you search for it.

The DVD only has a couple of other clips of Oppenheimer in action.

All in all, this is a mediocre DVD that does not add much more information if you already know much of the history of the making of the atomic bomb, and Oppenheimer's role in it.

However, if you don't know ANYTHING about this history, probably you'll find this DVD to be fascinating.",1176249600,35,2085,4.630434782608695
1706888,5,B0000648XV,"The period around the turn of the 20th century produced an enormous burst of discovery in physics. Often, it is the character of people involved that make this such a fascinating period of history. Still, the technical details of discovery and how it broadens our understanding of the physical world intrigues me to a somewhat larger degree.  As I was predisposed to the technical, I had hoped for more technical detail in the film.  However, far from disappointed, I watched the DVD twice the day I received it and found the film both compelling and entertaining.  Oppenheimer's story, told by those yet alive at the time.  A look into the Los Alamos community.  His political ""rise and fall.""  A rich and rewarding look into the not so distant past.  Highly recommended.",1169078400,15,772,4.847328244274809

1706890,5,B0000648XV,"This is the most engrossing documentary I've ever seen.  The portrait that emerges of Oppenheimer is more complimentary than deeper research would support, but director Jon Else has done a superb job of bringing the story of the people behind the making of the atomic bomb to life.

My favorite segments are the interviews with Robert Serber, Oppenheimer's TA at Berkeley and lifelong friend.  He's one of the most transparent people I've ever seen on film, and it's fascinating to watch him re-experience conflicting emotions about the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

What I would like to add is this; viewed in conjunction with Richard Rhodes' ""The Making Of The Atomic Bomb"", the interviews in this film with such people as Bob Serber, Robert Wilson, Hans Bethe and even Oppenheimer himself brought the characters in Rhodes' so much more to life that the film and the book together give you an almost 'you are there' feeling.

After I saw it, I was afraid for a while that all radio towers had atomic bombs in them, like the tower at the Trinity site, and that they would be set off if there was a war. Not too bad an understanding of the Cold War, in fact!
It told an engaging story; I remember rooting for the scientists during the bomb's construction, feeling excitement and dread at the test, and then horror at the aftermath of the attack on Hiroshima.
I haven't seen it since (though it is on my wish list). However, the impression it made on me lasts to this day, and the more I learn, the better I realize this film was.",1132358400,4,827,4.2405063291139244
