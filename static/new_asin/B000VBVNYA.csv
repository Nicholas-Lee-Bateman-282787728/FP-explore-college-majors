8217995,3,B000VBVNYA,It wasn't what I thought it would be. I expected more from the dvd. I thought it would be more instructive on the technique but it's more of an interview with Pearls. it's okay but just not what I thought it would be.,1372118400,,217,4.069767441860465
8217996,2,B000VBVNYA,This was an interview with Dr. Pearl.  The quality of the video was grainy and it stopped working about a quarter way through the interview.  His book was much better.,1366156800,4,167,4.533333333333333
8217997,2,B000VBVNYA,"I was disappointed because there were no healing modalities explained or witnessed. it was just an interview that lasted 30 minutes,",1364169600,6,132,5.333333333333333
8217998,3,B000VBVNYA,"Whilst the interview is great, I thought is was a bit pricey for a copy of a TV interview that goes for half hour 40 mins.",1358208000,,122,3.730769230769231
8217999,1,B000VBVNYA,"I wish i had read the reviews on the CD before purchasing this DVD...the host is terrible, and it is a rip off with very little info --- Eric is an amazing human and i am surprised he agreed to do this...it is not worth the shipping cost to watch...",1331683200,13,249,4.0
8218000,2,B000VBVNYA,".... Took too long time to send this to Norway and when I got it, it was just an interview, little to learn, little to know.
Way to Expensive for what I got out of the Dvd.
Ok quality.

8218001,1,B000VBVNYA,"This DVD is presenting day one of two seminars days. Day two is often referred to on the DVD (day one) as the day when Mr. Pearls teaches how to apply his healing on yourself and others. Day two of the seminar is not on the DVD and the essential part of the procedure is missing. Consequently you are purchasing a demoe for a new seminar to fill in what you are looking for. The DVD should inform about that, but does not. In addition, Mr. Pearls drive to be funny about everybody and anything else (in his direct way) just adds to the poor quality of this DVD in regard to presenting something of practical value to the viewer.",1235779200,49,628,4.241666666666666
8218002,1,B000VBVNYA,"First of all, this DVD is 28 minutes in length, NOT 60 minutes as was advertised when I bought this DVD in 2008--This advertising error was corrected several years after I bought it. This DVD consists of some quick opening credits, a one-on-one interview with Dr. Eric Pearl conducted by Mitchell Jay Rabin on a tiny, cheap video set/stage, some quick flashes of external video shots of the outside world that are edited into a few parts of the interview, and then some quick closing credits. This entire DVD/video lasts for 28 minutes. The interview itself lasts for about 25-26 minutes.

 This DVD contains no demonstrations of reconnective healings, no testimonials from people who have received reconnective healing treatments, nor does it show before-and-after images of the healings and improvements in health that reconnective healings have reportedly accomplished, and no other interviews or testimonials given from other reconnective practitioners, students, and patients of Eric Pearl on this DVD video. There is also no scientific research or evidence that is shown on this video as well.

 I have personally taken 2 of Eric Pearl's seminars in order to be certified in level 1 and 2 of reconnective healing, and have found it to be a very amazing and effective form of energy healing. This DVD does not do this very impressive and effective form of healing much justice in my opinion. I would highly recommend reading the book written about the reconnection, by Dr. Eric Pearl. I would also highly recommend taking the reconnective healing seminars that Eric Pearl and his associates conduct as well. I was very impressed and satisfied with the book and the seminars.

 If you are desperate to get any sort of DVD video footage of Dr. Eric Pearl, and a short, weak interview of him, then this very short 28 minute DVD video might be for you. However, if you expect to see any demonstration, training, visible evidence, or testimonials of reconnective healing from the public, and or any sort of demonstation of the reconnection, and hope to see a long, thorough, insightful interview of Dr. Eric Pearl; Then this DVD video will most likely be a big disappointment for most people. It was certainly a big disappointment for ME. And in all good conscience, I can NOT recommend this DVD to those that wish to learn much about reconnective healing, and Dr. Eric Pearl, who is the recognized founder of reconnective healing.",1219363200,95,2431,4.96068796068796
