8432600,5,B004K8UYTU,"Ride Ranger Ride is a fun western with Gene Autry as a displaced Texas Ranger who joins the US cavalry. Gene is under scrutiny however when his opinions clash with those of the commanding officer. Eventually,Gene is vindicated and must ride to the rescue to prevent a war with the indians. Gene, of course, sings a couple of songs and is joined by not 1, but 2 comedy sidekicks. One running gag has sidekick Jones betting sidekick Smiley Burnete's scalp wiith an indian. It's politically incorrect by today's standards, but it's all in fun.
West if the Divide stars a young John Wayne and ever popular sidekick Gabby Hayes must foil a scheme to steal a ranch. To do this Wayne poses as a wanted killer to get the confidence of the bad guy. One forgets how young Wayne was when he began his acting career. All in all, these are a couple of fun 1930s westerns.",1297209600,,858,4.471337579617835
