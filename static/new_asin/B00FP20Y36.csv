8617512,4,B00FP20Y36,"The film opens with a found footage tape, or perhaps a spoof of a found footage tape (it is hard to tell). It moves into a documentary style as locals talk about the legendary Nullarbor Nymph with speculation ranging from made up story to space alien. And plot spoiler- you get no closure. Two water works individuals driving in this area spot the Nymph and have an accident, stranded in the middle of no where having to fight off a sometimes naked woman. That is pretty much it.

The film is not so much of a horror as it is a comedy. They spoil the funny scenes by playing serious music. Sometimes that works, but it didn't work that well in this hour long feature.
