8553263,3,B00AL1WQ64,"Individual seems proficient at what he does, but unfortunately does not translate into teaching. Dvd is twice as long as it should be. Some of the video segments seem like they were made same day with no prior planning. He incorporates a lot of advance gadgets without even mentioning basic techniques. He is not bad or incapable of actually making long range shots just all over the place with his instruction. DVD is more for intermediate or advanced shooters that want to learn a couple gems if your willing to be patient, but not for beginner who is trying to learn from the bottom up.",1520121600,,589,4.619047619047619
