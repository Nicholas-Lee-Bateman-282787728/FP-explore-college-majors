188075,4,156949407X,"From Mrs. Carr's third period: This video was entertaining because the songs were catchy and easy to sing along with. The video helped us review the parts of speech and compare the differences between them. We were able to absorb the information while listening to the songs. The cartoons were really vivid and colorful, which made them stand out. Overall this video took us back to our elementary school days when we would all watch it in class. Conjunction Junction was a favorite. The rhyming and rhythm were very appealing.  Mr. Morton was not very good, however, at explaining the information about sentences. It just gave examples and didn't really explain it. It seemed like it was too short.",1237248000,,699,4.873949579831932
188076,5,156949407X,"I grew up in the 70's and 80's watching School House Rock.  My favorites have always been ""Interjection,"" ""Lolly Lolly Get Your Adverbs Here,"" ""Unpack Your Adjectives.""  Today, I teach College Prep Writing at a community college, and I introduce my students to the parts of speech with this video.  And when I do, I always hear the comments from the back of the room, ""Oh my God, she's even singing along.""  These songs work wonders even for adults.  Later on, when we get more in depth, all I have to say is ""Lolly Lolly"" and students start singing themselves.",1210982400,,561,4.57
188077,5,156949407X,"I work with many adult college students who do not remember basic grammar.  I often recommend they buy this for a quick, basic grammar review.  It sounds silly when I first say it, but this is a fun and memorable way to understand grammar.  Many students report watching it with their children.  It's also very helpful for ESL students.",1170892800,,336,4.6440677966101696
188078,3,156949407X,"Here's a quick fix or review for those children struggling with understanding grammar. Because of the easy tunes and rhyming lyrics, children will quickly remember the correct ways to use nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs, subjects, and predicates. Because of the age of the product, it has inherent problems. Grammar usage rules have changed over the years, so children may pick up some weak or incorrect ideas on usage. Although many of us remember ""Conjunction Junction"" with great delight, children need to recognize the new list of conjunctions. The video tends to stress passive writing over active writing. Bits of the language in the ""Adjective"" song allow kids to belittle or mock others. But the joy of learning through music--even with dated lyrics--allows for a meeting ground where parents can add to the learning process.",1168819200,4,845,5.266666666666667
188079,5,156949407X,"When my son was born, and only my singing seemed to comfort him, (my singing had never comforted anyone before...) I found myself singing ""The Preamble"" and ""Conjunction Junction."" I bought all four Schoolhouse Rock videos shortly afterwards.

 He's three now, and this is his second favorite video.(after ""Multiplication Rock"")

 He does, however, leave the room during ""Busy Prepositions."" I have no recollection of this one, and it doesn't measure up to the rest of the songs. I was surprised to find it was written by Bob Dorough, who wrote most of the others.

 One miss, and eight hits should still warrant a five star rating. ""Unpack Your Adjectives,"" ""Lolly, Lolly, Lolly, Get Your Adverbs Here,"" ""Conjunction Junction,"" ""Interjections,"" ""Rufus Xavier Sarsaparilla,"" ""Verb: That's What's Happening,"" ""A Noun is a Person Place Or Thing,"" and the fabulous ""The Tale of Mr. Morton"" are all classics.",1091145600,14,904,5.2
188080,5,156949407X,"I love this video! My mom bought it for me and my siblings when I was in second grade. I fell in love immediately. I still watch it just for old time's sake. The tunes are so catchy that I still remember all the words. For years, whenever I had a question on adverbs, for instance, the song from this video would come to mind. This is also partly why I got a 660 on the verbal section of my PSATs last year! If you buy this you'll never regret it!",1043452800,6,447,3.923076923076923
188081,5,156949407X,"I watched it as a child on saturday morning cartoons and now I play the tapes for my children 2 and 5. It is the best teaching cartoon music video on the market today. I keep waiting for new ones to come out!
My five year old can not yet spell or write well, but she knows what an adverb is. She is getting a strong foundation in grammar, math, history, and science from these tapes. I look forward to the complete collection in Aug 2002.
Highly recommended.

188082,5,156949407X,"This series pays of time after time after time. I watched the original series on T.V. as a child. I sang the preamble in order to pass in 7th grade,I passed English because I was able to ""pull out my adjectives"". Now, in the year 2000, My children are able to use these videos to enjoy learning. My 17 year old took it to her law and government class just last week. This is truly the best investment you will ever make. It combine learning with entertainment, and that isn't easy to do these days.",1018137600,,498,4.252631578947368
188083,5,156949407X,"I'm one of those children of the 70s who still remembers ""Grammar Rock, it's not your Gran'ma; it's your grammar"" brought to us by ""our very favorite general, General Foods"" on Saturday morning tv. These ""commercials"" were better than the shows, and that's even more true today. I'm thrilled to be able to pass these gems on to my kindergartner and 2nd grader, who are mastering learning parts of speech in great part due to the time-honored technique of combining information with catchy tunes and visual images. I've found Grammar Rock to be the most useful of the Schoolhouse Rock series, but the other titles are excellent as well. My daughter's learning her times tables to the tune of ""Three, It's A Magic Number""; and to this day I remember the preamble to the Constitution because of America Rock. Now if only someone with the same creative talents would add to the series...how about Geography Rock, Spelling Rock, etc.??",1011484800,13,930,4.855345911949685
188084,5,156949407X,"My kids love all the School House Rock videos, and want to watch them all the time. Grammar Rock is wonderful, teaching kids the basics of grammar with fun and catchy tunes, and cartoons to get the information into the child's mind. Even my two year old enjoys watching the videos, and my four year old can verbally identify interjections, nouns, pro-nouns, and verbs after watching the tapes. This tape is great in helping kids understand and remember grammar, I often refer back to the songs if one of my older kids needs help remembering.",1010448000,9,541,4.705263157894737
188085,5,156949407X,"I can remember watching School House Rock on Saturday mornings while watching cartoons.  ""We the People"" allowed me to memorize the preamble to the constitution in a fun way.  I didn't actually realize that I was learning during these ""educational commercials.""  Years later, during my high school constitution test, I literally sang the song ""in my head"" while writing down the preamble.  If you have children, you owe it to them to provide them with these School House Rock educational tools.  You had them to help you out, now let your children benefit from it as well.",987724800,5,572,4.855670103092783
188086,5,156949407X,"I am a twentysomething journalist who watched these snippets of education amidst my weekly stock of cartoons each Saturday morning long, long ago. We all know how receptive elementary-age children are to these cartoons, but they are done so well educationally that my editing class in college watched it (with great delight and recall of wonderful childhood memories, I might add!).
Just the fact that college students can find educational use from this video, which can also be enjoyed and useful to younger audiences is a testament to its real value. Do you realize how poorly we really grasp grammar in this country? This video, whether in your home or school's video library, will be a valuable tool. Each of the 11 parts of speech are featured.

188087,5,156949407X,"I wish I had a nickel for every ""Schoolhouse Rocks"" song I heard while watching cartoons at home as a kid back in...hey! It wasn't that long ago...was it? The people who created the series have never been adequately rewarded, considering how much millions of children have learned from this particularly brilliant brand of educational fun. What a concept. Making learning fun with music? Who'da thunk it? When I bought all the tapes for my four-year old, I couldn't believe that I still knew the words to all the songs- and I'm almost forty years old! Only complaint I have concerns the reviewer who remarked that a certain portion was ""non-PC""",974764800,4,644,4.8108108108108105
188088,5,156949407X,"I remember Grammar Rock when it first aired on television.  It is a colorful, engaging series of short cartoon segments that provide excellent examples of various grammar units such as conjunctions, verbs, nouns, interjections, pronouns, adverbs, etc.  As a teacher I use this video in my classroom and I never have to worry about quieting the students down.  They are fully focused when they watch, even transfixed!  The writing issues of subject/predicate are also explored, which is especially helpful when teaching sentences.  I loved this stuff in the 80's and I still love it!
The only downside is that there should be more blank space between learning segments, since units of grammar tend to be taught separately. I found I have to be quick on the draw with the remote so as not to run into the next segment.  Otherwise, ENJOY!",970099200,6,835,4.886524822695035
188089,5,156949407X,"These classic videos not only remind me of my own Saturday morning cartoon days, but I can still remember the catchy lyrics to this day, approximately 20 years later.  I have used this grammar video to help my 2nd and 3rd grade English Language Learners distinguish among nouns, verbs, and adjectives.  The results were very promising. (They often refer to the video as a reference to learning their parts of speech.)  In addition to the video's educational aspect, the animation is entertaining too.  My students ask to watch the video over and over.",969494400,9,551,4.89247311827957
188090,5,156949407X,"By far my favorite of the School House Rock videos, Grammar Rock is a wonderful teaching tool for children and a fun trip down memory lane for those of us old enough to remember when it was first aired on  television.
Anyone who has watched these videos knows that there is  definitely a link between music and memory, and School House Rock taps into  that phenomenon.  With cute animation and catchy lyrics, each video  utilizes music as a mnemonic device so children can remember the principles  of speech just by humming a familiar tune.
Who can forget those timeless  classics like ""Conjunction Juntion,"" ""Verb, That's What's  Happening,"" ""A Noun is a Person, Place or Thing,"" and my  favorite from Grammar Rock, ""Interjection!""?  Many adults who  grew up with these videos can still recall them today.
I urge everyone  who has children to buy the entire School House Rock video set.  Start with  Grammar Rock, and then move on to Math, then History, then Science.  Your  children will thank you for it.",962150400,79,1007,4.8011695906432745

Whenever I teach a lesson on a part of speech I usually use this tape to introduce the part we will be talking about.  I cannot imagine  my lessons without it!  It works best if you introduce one part of speech  each day by playing the tape and then doing activities that tie in with  that part of speech.

Anyway, I thought my 16-month old daughter would enjoy the catchy songs and the cartoon format.  I figured it wasn't too early to  start her learning from something besides the awful stuff on regular  television.  Anyway, I was right.  I play it for her every day, and when  she hears it she sits down and is glued to the set for half an hour.  Of  course I'm sitting there right along with her.
