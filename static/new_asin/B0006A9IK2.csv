The leading man who belives himself to be Tori handed me this DVD for free at Benaroya Hall last week, where I attended Amos' concert. He was hilarious in person and complimented my shirt! I love independant films and to get one with at least something to do with Tori for free!!! was pretty damn neat. The film itself was very funny, but a little uncomfortable at times, (and sad). But the craziness and hilarity is more overpowering than that. This is a keepsake from the concert I will remember (and question) forever.",1114300800,,658,4.632478632478633
8214621,5,B0006A9IK2,"wow...I was not expecting what I saw. What I thought was going to be a biopic about a Tori Fan is actually a tour-de-force of insanity, toilet humor and cross-dressing, oh yeah and a more than healthy serving of ""shisha"", which is apparently some sort of weird hashish. anyway. The characters are all very funny, and The main character Josh Lowell-the guy who thinks he's Tori Amos, is hilarious! The humor actually comes from the irony, I mean, he doesn't act like Tori at all, but more like a stoner, skateboarder who sez ""F"" this and ""F"" that , but hey, it made me laugh, I guess now I can take the lessons I learned from this movie and tell everyone I meet in life to ""F"" off. Cheers.

oh yes, I forgot, the gothic chick, I think she's ""Malaise"", she's really hot, yes I like girls, and she'd be the first entree on my plate.",1111536000,,829,4.314102564102564
8214622,4,B0006A9IK2,"Starring Brian ""The Jew"" Laberque and some other people I have never heard of... This movie is about a lost 30 something named Josh who thinks he is Tori Amos. It's a documentry style flick that depects his life in Seattle. My favorite part in the movie is his therory of relationship hookers. Esentially it's where you hire a hooker to harass you and follow you around, kinda like a real girlfriend would. This movie is a steal @ $10.48 so buy buy like 20 of them. They would make good birthday gift, plus it's would get writer/director/actor Brian Labreque off the street....",1098662400,,577,4.611650485436893
