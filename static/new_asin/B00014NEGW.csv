8006343,1,B00014NEGW,a few blurry pictures and all talking.  boring.  needed more clear films.,1503014400,,73,5.0
8006344,5,B00014NEGW,Great information for everyone who has followed the Martin Stubbs story. Martin Stubbs contributed a great deal to what is now the research of UFOs captured from Space Shuttle video cameras and the cameras on the International Space Station. Martin Stubbs has recorded more anomalies in space than anyone else in history. Recommend that you watch The Secret NASA Transmissions Part One first before seeing this Part 2.,1502236800,,418,5.161764705882353

One, he's very sorry because NASA now transmits still photo's only so nobody can study more footage.

Two: A few sources are revealed because they suffered the consequences of their actions already. The most notable being the Canadian Astronaut who was pulled from a spaceflight days before the launch because it was discovered that he was the one who had distributed the tape among Astronauts that became ""The Favorite Underground Footage Among Astronauts"".

Three: That there are other, much more nefarious reasons for the 10 mile ""Tether"" that was the focus of much of the footage regarding ""Phenomena 1"" (the flying indiscernable circles- shaped liked donuts).

There is one more thing noting; Allusions to many things are made about things like the tether, but no opinions/theories whatsoever. There is nothing here except a few bucks for the people who made the first video. Their hearts are in the right place, but this is just fluff, follow-up interview with one person and no footage at all.

I'd like to say as well, EFF YOU MR. JAMES OBERG OF NASA. Your a truly EVIL person. That is, unless they pay you for your services which are performed flawlessly and with a level of explanation that is ASININE and OBVIOUS.

The ""DVD"" is also home-made with Office Depot style labeling. They should've charged 5 bucks.",1115856000,10,1359,4.861471861471862
