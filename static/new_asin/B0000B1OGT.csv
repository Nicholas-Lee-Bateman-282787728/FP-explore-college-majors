Deliver Us From Eva - A Cute And Sensible Romance Comedy Starring Gabrielle Union At Her Hottest. 5/5
The Best Man - Sweet And Light Hearted 5/5",1074384000,,248,4.297872340425532
7998026,5,B0000B1OGT,Sometimes you just need to escape with movies like this.  You need to see your fantasies about how families should care for each other and what love should be played out.  It doesn't matter how far fetched or predictable.  It's all a good reality check.  These beautiful African American's all did a fabulous job with the script. They leave you wanting more which is precisely what all good movies are intended to do.  This is definitely one for the collection.,1049068800,,461,4.7125
7998027,4,B0000B1OGT,This was a really good movie! I mean it was predictable and all but the actors were great and it was a pretty good movie. The one thing that was sorta stupid was the tyying him up part but other than that it was a good movie and it had a sweet ending!,1047600000,2,251,3.7547169811320753
7998028,5,B0000B1OGT,"This movie is very entertaining, funny as well as, sentimental.  The movie keeps your attention from start to finish.  Gabrielle and LL's chemistry is more than just a one night stand, but has the kind of passion you like to see onscreen.  Deliver us from Eva proves that you can still enjoy an excellent movie without nudity, alot of sex and bloodshed....This is a definite GO SEE movie and own it when available.",1046304000,5,414,4.6438356164383565
7998029,2,B0000B1OGT,"i really wanted to like this movie, but it turned out to be exactly what i expected: shallow, predictable & poorly written.  they got a few chuckles out of me, but the overall movie wasn't funny or even entertaining.  gabrielle union is obviously very talented, and she deserves a much better script.",1045440000,2,300,4.75
7998030,4,B0000B1OGT,"You have to love modern-day depictions of Shakespearian classics. This fun-loving comedy was the perfect treat after a stressful week at work.
I have to admit that the first ten minutes--a long time in cinema--were rough. I was concerned about the success of this movie because the script was defintiely weak. But, they pulled through in the end with the non-stop laughs, brilliant acting of Union and Smith and the unmasked vulnerability of a ""ladies"" man on the big screen.
This is the first time I have ever seen Union as a three-dimensional character.  I enjoy all of her movies, but I have been waiting for her to really showcase her talent. She did in ""Eva"" and I thank her for it. The other ladies were mediocore at best. The guys were terrible. They overacted and failed to convince me that they deserved to be in this film. I have definitely seen better. The film was at its best when the screen was occupied by Union and Smith. They're chemistry was believable and their relationship progressed logically.
If Union, and other rising black stars want to be taken seriously and really receive credit for their skills, they need to stop making cheesy black movies. The black community loves them, and a large portion of white America does, too. But, they won't receive awards or true success if they limit themselves to films that don't get much support or have weak scripts.",1045180800,,1382,4.734439834024896
7998031,5,B0000B1OGT,"this movie was all about LL i mean thats all t girls were into his body oooh and especially those nice lips, i could've been that girl in the movie i would've been a lot better than her but she was lucky i know she liked doing tha movie with LL cool J i know i would've",1044748800,,269,3.736842105263158
7998032,4,B0000B1OGT,"Over 300 years ago, a fella known as The Bard of Stratford on Avon wrote a comedy called The Taming of the Shrew.  This is an updated black version of the same.  A player is paid to woo a sister (EVA) so that the fella's paying him can get together with her sisters.  In a nutshell.  I say, anything promoting Shakespeare must have redeeming qualities.  Plus, it has LL Cool J; a man of infinite jest and slammin' stage and screen presence.",1036886400,10,440,4.317073170731708
