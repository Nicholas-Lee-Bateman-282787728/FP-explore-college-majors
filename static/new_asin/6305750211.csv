1079526,5,6305750211,"As a long time fan of Kevin Smith's work, I was always curious as to who the heck was Vincent Pereira? Now I know, he is one hell of a writer/film maker! ""A Better Place"" struck home on many chords with me. Vincent has artfully captured the fellings of angst and isolation that I so often felt in High School. He shows the sort of things that go on that parents and teachers either didn't know about, or didn't want to know about. Things that always caused my jaw to drop in disbelief when an adult would refer to my time in school as ""The best years of your life!"" You mean it gets worse? (A quick word of reassurance to those of you still in school, don't worry, for the most part it gets better.) Things like being picked on for no apparent reason, getting hasseled, if not actually beaten up, again for little or no apparent reason. Getting mocked, derided, and put upon, for who you are, or how you look, or who you choose to be friends with. ""A Better Place"" is somewhat like ""The Breakfast Club"", but without the Hollywood fantasy of problems being solved in a good happy way, and boy getting the girl, and all that (stuff).
The Movie:
I don't want to give too much away, suffice to say Barret Michaelson(Robert DiPatri-excellent job) has a rough time at his first day in a new school, falls in with loner Ryan Walker(Eion Bailey-another excelent perfomance, this guy has future STAR writen all over him) and although they share much in common, it soon becomes apparent that Ryan is walking a darker path. His talks of (...), soon turn to rants of sterilization, and genocide. And the longer Barret knows him the more deeply he becomes entwined in his life. Barret becomes Ryan's only connection to a world gone bad, his relief valve, someone he can share his thoughts and ideas with, without fear of (too harsh a) judgement. Barret becomes his anchor, and when Barret fimally begins to make other friends, Ryan finds(sets) himself cast adrift, alone with his own dark thoughts, no way to get them out of his system. Things just get uglier from there.
The Extras:
Lots of outtakes, outtakes with commentary, film commentary with Vince and others, old sound to new sound comparisons, and three(count 'em three) intros by Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier(which in all honesty are out of place in this movie, it's hard to justify their yucking it up with the tone of the film, I love these guys, but they could've been a little more serious for this one.)
The Look:
Yes it's low budget, yes some scenes are lower quality, or even blurry, but the writing is dead on, and the acting so good as to put a number of so called ACTORS to shame. Vincent talks about a few more cuts he would've liked to make, and I'd agree with him, but as a whole the movie is well shot, framed, acted, edited, and writen.
Vincent doesn't offer up any pat answers for his characters' behaviors, although he does give us a look at their family life(or lack thereof), as a way of giving us an idea of how these kids became who they are. Justifiably so. At some point you have to be responsible for your actions, but how you are raised goes a long way to how you behave and act towards others. I have known guys like Ryan, perhaps never knowing how close to the edge they walked. I have had the occasional Ryan like thought, but never acted upon them, and they soon passed. Vicent has acted upon his Ryan like thoughts by making this movie. He deserves all the praise he recieves.",1005523200,3,3453,4.4565560821484995
1079527,5,6305750211,"As a huge fan of all of Kevin Smith's movies, I cannot help but try to find something, anything, of his to enjoy and pass the time before his next pic.  There is only so much material out there of his work, and after seeing all his movies, listened to all the commentary tracks, and read his comics, i couldn't help but try to find something more.  So lo and behold, on [a] website I found a post about a newly released dvd directed by Vincent.  I immediately ordered it, and wondered how he could possibly stack up against Smith's efforts.  And the end result was that I was blown away by this movie.  I watched it four times in the span of two days, including once with the commentary track.  I even made my roommate watch it, and even though he doesn't particularly like indie films, he was equally impressed.  This movie has restored my faith in good filmmaking, especially after an uneventful summer of movies.  And now I can't wait for Vulgar and Drawing Flies to be finally released on dvd.  If you are looking for a smart and edgy alternative to the big effects laden world of modern cinema, I can't think of A Better Place to look than this dark and disturbing movie.  But I mean that in a good way.",999820800,3,1208,4.328888888888889
1079528,5,6305750211,"I saw this movie way back in October at Vulgarthon 2000.  It is one of the most effective, well written, and precisely directed films that I have seen.

1079530,4,6305750211,"Not only is this a great movie, but on this forthcoming dvd, you also have the chance to see Vincent pereira's directors cut, along with intro's by Kevin Smith. The movie itself is fantastic - it follows the unfortunate  Barrett Michaelson, who is having a bad first day at his new high school -  he is badgered, ridiculed, and nearly beaten up. He finds an unlikely ally  in local loner, Ryan Walker, an intelligent but misanthropic youth with a  dark family past. A friendship quickly develops, but Barrett begins to  worry as Ryan's philosophical ranting turns increasingly violent. When  Barrett does the unthinkable and makes peace with the local teenagers Ryan  so despises, Ryan loses all control and attempts to drag Barrett down into  his world of hatred and destruction - and Barrett must find a way to  escape. I highly recommend this film.",963273600,,851,4.854166666666667
1079637,1,6305750211,"This movie started with a great idea for a story. However, the screenwriter was completely unable to realize that story. What could have been something as good as The Green Mile ended up as bad as the worst after school special on the Hallmark Channel in the history of time. The story is so weak that it is impossible to discern how good or how awful the acting might be. It is possible that the actors are highly skilled but the greatest chef in the world cannot make a fine meal of a can of Spam and some Twinkies. This is one of the absolute worst screenplays ever written. That is saying quite a lot. I thought the idea for the story was fantastic. The screenplay writer needs to go back to the third grade and move through all those years of elementary school, high school, and then go back to university. That is about the level of the writing, and honestly I don't think education would work. I think the writer simply needs to go into a completely different line of work.

 The characters were drawn in stark black and white. The evil characters were completely evil and had no depth to them at all. The dialogue was ridiculous. The actions and decision-making of the characters were too juvenile to even earn the label, ""sophomoric."" I am not a mean-spirited person and I don't like saying things like that, but this was a shockingly terrible screenplay. I weep for the actors who had to do their best with this ghastly thing.

As for the directing, it is hard to tell because screenplays include quite a bit of directing instruction in them. The director may have been limited as to what he can do with the weird amounts of time the people in the story were ignoring what was happening right next to them. Perhaps he thought that was a good way to do it or possibly his hands were tied by the contract he had requiring him to adhere to the script for those things. We cannot know this. If he was not given the freedom to change those things, I feel sorry for him, too. It would certainly grieve him to have his name attached to this awful project.

 I recommend, rather than watching this movie, you spend your time watching paint dry. It will be much more entertaining and you will be able to make up a story in your own imagination which will be far superior. I am one of the unfortunates who gave time in my life to watching this film and I will never get that time back. Yes, that's how bad it is.",1479427200,2,2412,4.351111111111111

Some of it though is kinda amateur, but the acting of the two main characters was amazing. Especially the acting of Eion Bailey who played Ryan, the ""bad"" guy. I really felt sympathy for him and for the other main character, Barret, the ""good"" guy. I also thought that the way  the quality looked, gritty and a little grainy, increased my experience of watching the movie. It made it feel more raw...Overall this is a very good movie and it definitely will stick with me for a while. It left me feeling the same way I felt after watching Requiem For a Dream, disturbed.

1079714,5,6305750211,"It's a little rough around the edges, as any independent film is, but it is truly a work of art. I first saw this film about ten years ago on IFC, and it really stuck with me. I was kind of young, so as time went on it slipped my mind, until I was browsing around the View Askew web store and saw they had it for sale. Instantly it brought me back to when I first watched it. It's a really powerful movie, and even brutal at times. So I had to come to Amazon and order it.

It's a dramatic independent film that takes an entirely new look at high school violence and person's life in that environment. (well, maybe new isn't the right word because it's been out for a long time) It's a really well made film with a lot of emotion attached to it. I made my girlfriend watch it and by the time the credits were rollings she was in tears. Can't recommend this movie enough.",1310774400,2,870,4.058139534883721
1079715,3,6305750211,"It was a chore to watch the first thirty minutes of this movie. Then I sat through quite a few scenes where the characters are the kind of jerks that I wanted to get out of my chair and hit them and the writer. It's sort of like Billy Jack for the new millenium but without the martial arts and without Billy Jack who was a big douche bag but could occasionally be riveting!

If you like movies about the most pretentious jerks in high school making the dumbest, most serious mistakes possible, then this is the movie for you. It is full of roaring, flaming jerks and a boring feret who looks very uncomfortable being around such tools.",1298332800,,636,4.34453781512605
1079716,4,6305750211,"I would have liked seeing a few more dollars thrown at this film.  Some stories are LARGER than a low-budget film will adequately handle, but not for the talent.  The talent was superlative.  The storyline was depressing enough, so I would have appreciated something I could have grasped on to (i.e.: extra light and nicer exterior shots).

It was almost like watching the ""training film"" for the actions of the kids at Colombine (and others) that scared me the most.  It's true...  It's all so true!

I spent a good deal of time waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Was it going to be a mass murder at school or suicides.  Well, I won't spoil it for anyone, instead I'll just say that you should have a box of tissues handy, just in case you need them.",1261785600,,753,4.398550724637682
1079717,4,6305750211,"Well, you know you're in for a low-budget movie experience when one of the opening credits reads ""Camera: Ian Dudley"" (as it does in this movie). And that's not meant to be a knock against Ian Dudley: it's just that it says ""camera"".  Singular.  As in one.

Fortunately, in my world, low budget does not equal low quality.  In fact, I often find it to be just the opposite: the constraints and restrictions forced upon filmmakers by a lack of financing can lead to more creative ways of approaching things which might not have occurred otherwise.  And though I think that occasionally happened with the movie ""A Better Place,"" this $40,000 flick ultimately falls just a little bit short of greatness (though more because of its writing than its lack of budget).

The movie begins with a voiceover spoken by the charmingly earnest high school senior Barret (Robert DiPatri, who resembles a younger, much more sincere Ed Helms), after he and his mom relocate following the death of his father: ""We came here to start over - a new life in a better place.  We should've stayed behind.""

So right away, you know things aren't going to go particularly well.  And boy don't they!  After a particularly miserable (and shakily filmed) first day at his new school (at times giving new meaning to the phrase ""lack of focus in the classroom""), Barret befriends local outcast Ryan (Eion Bailey), who is considerably less charming than Barret.  Ryan is, in fact, so aggressively misanthropic that he favors nothing less than the catastrophic extinction of the species.  Not so charming at all!  And it isn't long before you realize why Barret might just have been better off had he, in fact, stayed behind.

The phrase ""a better place"" actually appears in two key scenes in the movie: at the beginning (as quoted above) and in a pivotal (and ironic) scene in Ryan's bedroom, where he and Barret discuss the finer points of Sartre: ""The way Sartre see it, if people would just accept responsibility for their actions...the world just might be a better place,"" says Ryan.  But when Barret asks, ""So, do you accept responsibility for all your actions?"" Ryan just kind of laughs and says, ""Yeah - most of the time.""

Not too much later, when we see how Ryan handles an unfortunate occurrence in the woods (""we can make this look like an accident""), we realize that Ryan is like many teens who can absorb ideas conceptually but can't yet put them into practice experientially.  This turns out to have some major repercussions down the road.

This film is rich with ideas and a serious, oftentimes foreboding tone - it gets a little River's Edgy at times.  Its talkiness, I feel, owes more to films in the Richard Linklater canon like ""Waking Life"" than it does to Kevin Smith's usual View Askew/Clerks fare.  It's got a hauntingly, hypnotically effective mostly-electronic soundtrack, and Ian Dudley usually does a good job with that one camera.

Where the movie falls a little short for me is that the generally-solid acting gets a bit amateurish at times, and the dialog a bit too writerly and not entirely natural-sounding in spots.  Now, it's true that great acting can occasionally overcome stilted dialog, and that great dialog can often inspire actors to transcend their limitations.  Here, however, the confluence of uncertain acting and writing sometimes makes some of the scenes ring a bit false.  Plus, one aspect of the ending also seemed a bit forced, as I feel there might have been more plausible ways of getting the three characters to the same place at the end.

With all of that being said, however... this DVD is a gem.  It's absolutely crammed with extras, most of them as interesting as the film itself.  The three introductions with Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier are hilarious, there are 8 deleted scenes (both with and without commentary), a comparison of the film's original mono mix with the remixed sound done at Skywalker Ranch, and not one, but two feature commentaries with writer/director Vin Pereira and cast members Brain Lynch (Eddie), Joseph Cassese (Todd) and Rob DiPatri.  The first commentary is a bit annoying, as we hear for ourselves why Pereira has the reputation for talking too much (A fun challenge: see if you can identify the very few moments when he lets one of the others say more than two sentences in a row!)

But the second, ""ultra-secret"" hidden Easter Egg bonus drunken commentary is a riot.  It is here where you will learn that Brian Lynch is, indeed, the funniest man alive.  Also, learn amazing things about topics such as (but not limited to): Toothless Joe's ""shaved teeth"" (the style at the time), Ben ""I was in Armageddon"" Affleck's future prophetic nickname, and Eion Bailey's gay filmmaking choices.  Plus, did they really kill that horseshoe crab?  All that, and guest cameos from ""George Lazenby"" and Silent Bob!

Thus, while I give the movie itself three stars, the feature-packed DVD is worthy of nothing less than five, making my overall rating four stars.  Good stuff.",1174780800,4,5017,4.828070175438596
1079718,4,6305750211,"This movie could have easily been written off as just another ""feel bad for teens"" flick, though I believe since only a small portion of the film takes place within school property, a different focus is put on the main characters than the simple angst-ridden garden variety.

""A Better Place"" treads new ground in its focus on the scales of justice and the human response to personal trauma. Sparing the plot (because it doesn't really matter AND it's been said over and over throughout many reviews here), the general idea of the film is that though two people can share similar experiences, they won't necessarily grow from them similarly. Interpretation and what one takes from life's unfortunate circumstances are as varied as the clothes people can wear. In the case of our ""heroes,"" Barret and Ryan, they may have become friends via a similar stroke of bad luck, their outlook on life in its basic form couldn't be any more different. Thus begins the ultimate conflict of the film.

The main driving point that the movie makes is that when you experience hardship in any form, either you learn from it, pick yourself up and move on with life with a better understanding of how to handle stress...or you allow it to bubble inside yourself; eventually letting it bring you to the point of desperation. ""A Better Place"" is philosophical, psychological and very, very simple as well. ..simply put, ""a better place"" may not be a literal reference to a location on a map where one may run to when looking to escape the torments of home or one's history.

It may be locked away deep in the mind or the heart. A little serenity surely would have helped Barret and Ryan in the long run.",1161734400,2,1683,4.679054054054054

1079721,4,6305750211,"""A Better Place"" is a disturbing and unsettling look at teen violence.  This is a film that is so raw and brutal that it literally shakes you when you're not expecting it.  Be warned, this is not a film to watch if you're looking for something to enjoy.  This is as harsh and intense as it gets.
The movie tells the story of Barret Michaelson; the new kid in town.  The first day at his new school he is picked on by almost everybody.  He makes friends with Ryan; an isolated loaner who doesn't particularly like people in general.  As time passes by, Ryan drags Barret further and further into his worldview of hate and darkness.  It isn't long before things become violent and dangerous, leading to an unbelievably shocking and cruel finale.
It's hard to believe that this movie came from View Askew.  Who would've thought they could've come out with something so intense and dark?  As disturbing and chilling it is, it's an honest movie.  It's not a glamorous film, and it's not trying to be one.  That's why it's so effective.  It has a raw and brutal feel to it all, and that's what makes it so powerful.
I thought the movie was very well-written and directed.  I kind of felt that it could've been longer and that Ryan's character could've been expanded more.  But for the most part, it's a very good movie.  It reminds me of ""Bully,"" except ""A Better Place"" is much more ""slice-of-life"" resembling.  It's effective because it doesn't feel like a movie, but more like something that is actually happening.
The DVD has some special features, such as commentary, deleted scenes and more.  There are some really cool Easter Eggs if you can find them.  (Look at some of the other reviews, and you will find them.)
""A Better Place"" is a shocking and unrelenting film that is as honest as it is disturbing.  Not too many movies like this are out there.

1079804,4,6305750211,"... For being shot for an amazing $40,000, this is an amazing looking movie. It was shot all on 16mm film and looks great for the most part. Yea, some parts are grainy and a few transitions are slow, it is otherwise a great deal. The acting is also very good, with a few actors/actresses found in other View Askew films. The plot focuses around teen violence, as the two main characters are deemed outcasts from their school. The ways they handle the emotional scenes is amazing for unknown, under paid actors.
Hopefully Pereira will soon be given more money to make a movie with some better visuals, actors and props. With that, we could have almost a perfect movie. Think about it. We got this from a first time director.
In short, if you're a fan of the other View Askew stuff and are looking for something other than a comedy, go for this. But be warned: this movie does have its fair share of violence. Overall this is a great movie.",1027296000,5,938,4.427745664739884

On the second special thanks screen, you are now able to highlight a few of the names in the special thanks. Highlight ""The Pizza Guy"" and you will be taken to a hidden menu called ""Loopholes"" where you can access the trailer for the hysterical movie ""Big Helium Dog"" and a second audio commentary for A Better Place, this time with the members of the pervious commentary drunk out of their gords...fun stuff.

1079806,5,6305750211,"I borrowed this movie from a friend without ever hearing of the movie itself or of the director.  Although low budget, ""A Better Place"" turned out to be the best movie I've seen in a very long time.  Right off the bat I became drawn to the main character, trying to discover what was in store for him, as him and his mother moved to a new town after the death of his father.  After a rough first day at school, Barret becomes friends with an introverted nihilist who has a strong hatred for humanity (Ryan).  Barret is drawn (by Ryan) into an accidental manslaughter and the movie takes off snowballing to the amazing ending.  The ending is amazing because it is very surprising and complicates most of the themes and the overall message of the movie.  The film deals with a lot of philosophical issues like the problem of evil, the existence of God, morals, ethics, and especially free will vs. determinism.  Overall, a very thought provoking, intelligent, well made piece.  Highly recommended.",1012176000,6,995,4.67816091954023
1079807,4,6305750211,"Thoughtful and harrowing story about teenage alienation and its consequences.  In pre-Columbine days, this story might have seemed a bit overblown, but now it rings with a truth that can't be denied.  The actors put their best foot forward and the director handles the proceedings with assurance and style, despite the budget shortcomings.  This disc did not play at all on my Toshiba player model SD-1200 (kept telling me ""disc error"" and failed to load), but my Apex AD-600A handled it perfectly.
A highly recommended independent gem.",1008633600,5,536,5.137931034482759

1079809,4,6305750211,"When I bought this movie I had really heard little about it besides that it was independent and had something to do with Kevin Smith.  I decided to buy the movie; although, I am not a very ethusiastic fan of Kevin Smith.
The characterization in this movie is overall good.  The director tries to show the relationships in a way that avoids too much cheesiness.  This is generally accomplished with the careful crafting of what would be included in the movie.  It was clear that the deleted scenes were good choices to be deleted.
The actors in the movie are pretty good.  Most of them were fairly new to acting but this did not stop them from showing glimpses of wonderful acting.  It did not take to long to start to really empathize with the characters in the film.
However, I think there could have done more with the film.  The story had some rough spots that seem as though could have been fixed with a little more time and paying attention to details.  Regardless, it still is a wonderful movie to own and fun to watch.",1007769600,2,1025,4.44385026737968

It is one of the most effective, well written, and precisely directed films that I have seen. Written and directed by Vincent Pereira who you may know as the View Askew historian, this is a fantastic film with lots of kevin smith influence in it. Very well put together with some unsuspected twists. if that wasn't enough some great DVD features including commentary... check it out!",1006992000,3,476,4.546511627906977
1079811,5,6305750211,"This film is one of the best low-budget flicks I've seen in the last decade.  Like many others before him, the writer, director and editor Vincent Pereira has excelled himself: proving that you don't need millions to create a cinematic landmark (albeit a small one).  `A BETTER PLACE' primarily deals with teen aggression.  But do not fear!!  This is by no means a John Hughes movie.  Never before have I seen this subject matter displayed  in such a controversial, uncompromising and honest manner.
Occasionally the acting seems to go rather slack and a few technical blips are apparent but this is easily overlooked.  In my opinion, this flick is an accomplished piece of film-making that consistently delivers its message like a deliberate smack in the face - right up to its brutal finale.
It's great to see distributors like `SYNAPSE FILMS' out there preventing little gems like `A BETTER PLACE' from fading into the abyss.  Synapse have done an excellent job in making this film's production value seem more than $40,000.  I'm unsure as to whether or not it was shot on standard 16mm or super 16 but the footage sometimes looks extremely crisp and the sound quality is top-notch  (considering  the source material they probably had to work with).  Also, the DVD extras are a worthwhile asset: interesting and informative and not pointless like some discs I could mention.
At its best, `A BETTER PLACE' is raw, intense, gripping and a truly disturbing film.  It's a great pity that many other film-makers don't take a leaf out of Mr Pereira's book and put more thought into their work.  Highly recommended!!!",1005609600,3,1613,4.904059040590406
7895524,1,6305750211,"This movie was terrible in every way. The dialogue was flat and I don't think good acting could even have saved it, and there definitely wasn't any of that. It wasn't even bad enough to be entertaining. I will watch most movies to the end, just to give them a chance but I really regret wasting my time with this one. I don't know how it got any good reviews at all. I did notice that some of the other reviews talked about characters and actors that weren't even in this movie, so I don't know what was going on there. The story was lame, the characters were one-dimensional stereotypes, the dialogue was strained, the acting was unbelievable, and the ending was pointless and confusing. The only thing that could have saved it would have been if everyone died at the end.",1516665600,,773,4.450704225352113

7895526,3,6305750211,"To be vague as possible, as to not spoil too much, the end was terrible. The rest was decent.

The end scenes have nothing to do with the rest of the movie prior to. It's very deus ex to add a resolution to the conflict, which could have been resolved by itself had the ""new power"" at the end not suddenly appeared out of the blue and added with a sudden context. I think the movie Powder has a slight resonance with this plot, but I also believe that the movie did a lot better with portraying archetypal good and bad people. Also, the girl's comments that Jeremy was basically egging him on was correct, and didn't seem to flow with the next characteristic (the ""new power"") based on the obviousness of where he drew it from.

And then the strange scene with the pastor looking all shocked...what the hell did that have to do with anything? He was incredibly unimportant at that point and played his part already...very strange.",1505174400,,930,4.464705882352941

He must endure a bully in a crooked town. He makes a friend in Jess (Mary Ann Raemisch) who is a prisoner in her life.

The film is mostly a drama, except for the ""condition."" The ending of the film hints at non-specific religious overtures that were not hinted at during the rest of the film. The acting wasn't that great and perhaps some of that had to do with the dysfunctional characters. The idea was unique enough to keep you engaged, but the execution had issues.
