382186,2,6301928008,"Watched this DVD several times and lost track of the plot. Actually,I bought it because of the final  scenes in Grand Central Terminal showing areas which are not open to the public.",1162771200,4,182,4.6875
382187,2,6301928008,"It started out with so much promise. It's the Mc Carthy era & paranoia rules. Kelly McGillis gets caught up in it & loses her job. With time on her hands she stumbles onto what becomes a plot to smuggle Nazi into the country. Meanwhile she is being harassed by The FBI. Agent Jeff Daniels gets friendly & she enlist him into what she has discovered. He helps her in his spare time & falls for her(who wouldn't). Mandy Patinkin is pleasently evil. There is a gratuitous shot of Kelly's breasts while she is in the shower. Maybe the high point of the movie. Actually she pulls off being a career woman of the 50's very well. Lots of slow spots, & a silly chase in the rafters of Grand Central Station. It's only 101 minute longer but seemed longer. Maybe I can squeeze 21/2 stars.",1090540800,4,778,4.335616438356165
382188,4,6301928008,"I just watched this movie again last night, having watched it before when it was first released. My motive for writing this review is to add one positive contribution to this collection of downward pointing thumbs.
Well, yes, it is sort of an ordinary cloak and dagger film, but I enjoyed seeing a female lead character who was gutsy, a lady who didn't follow the stereotype of the ankle sprainer who has to lean on the big strong man for protection. Actually it is a good thing that Kelly McGillis isn't prone to ankle injuries, because she certainly does a lot of running in this flick. She just seems to be in a hurry wherever she goes, and trots along at a good clip even when she isn't being chased. Sometimes I felt I was watching another version of Run Lola Run.
Anyway the time period is the Joe McCarthy era, and Kelly loses her job because she refuses to name names to Congress. By chance she discovers some strange happenings that indicate maybe there are some ex (current?) Nazis inflitrating her pleasant neighborhood. Well the FBI is involved, too, and the chase is on. Evil people flit in and out, and surprises happen when people open doors.
Admittedly the tale is sort of muted Hitchcock, and not particularly exceptional in its plot, but I found it to be a pleasant thriller to watch. I must also confess that I was mesmerized by Ms McGillis's breathtaking beauty. She was about 30 when this movie was made, and, gosh, I just fell in love with her.",1078358400,25,1466,4.535849056603774
382189,3,6301928008,"This Peter Yates directed thriller was written by Walter Bernstein, who had been blacklisted in the McCarthy era, and had written about it for The Front. Here Bernstein takes his anti-McCarthy paranoia one step further by suggesting that Roy Cohn tried to illegally smuggle former Nazis into America, posing them under the name of dead Jews. Yates' underrated skill manages to overcome this somewhat far-fetched premise, providing a woman in peril drama with various Hitchcock-ian setpieces - a wedding reception, a church, a bookshop, a theatre, and the climax at Grand Central Terminal. He also attempts a romance between the woman targetted by the FBI and an FBI agent who feels guilty about her harassment. While the romance is aided by the score by Georges Delerue, and Jeff Daniels is acceptable, if a bit comically light, to play the male lead, Yates has more trouble with Kelly McGillis as the woman. In spite of her skill, McGillis isn't a romantic actress. No matter how effectively she is styled for the period, she lacks vulnerability so that we never feel she will be defeated. Pauline Kael memorably compared McGillis to Charlton Heston. Yates partially compensates by having her silent and on the run, but when in one scene she is naked in the bath being menaced by Mandy Patinkin as the Roy Cohn figure, while she acts vulnerable, it's not truthful. Patinkin playing his menace with musical comedy timing doesn't help either. Perhaps if he sang to her in his terrifying falsetto, McGillis would be truthfully frightened. Jessica Tandy appears briefly as a woman McGillis is paid to read to, and I was disappointed that Bernstein found no way to bring her further into the plot. Even the Carroll Street house (though I don't recall hearing the name Carroll Street ever mentioned) is disposed of quickly. And Patinkin has an odd speech where he demonstrates the logic of his shenanigans by splashing ketchup on a white tablecloth. The Grand Central climax is handled awkwardly when everyone is climbing the belfry (why do people being pursued always go up and no down?!), but Yates comes off better with a chase in a bookshop, and the wedding reception, with Daniels and McGillis dancing and spying. It's a pity Bernstein decided to take on this comic book style approach to an abhorrent moral and political time in history. You would think that someone who was blacklisted would not pander to such a base Hollywood aesthetic. McCarthy was scary enough without making him and his pals neo-Nazis.",985046400,6,2509,4.947867298578199

382213,4,6301928008,I find myself going back to this movie every so often and watching it.  I think the performances are good and the time period is interesting.  It's a good reminder that we are as hypocritical and prone to over-reaction as any other society and a reminder of how easily authority and power can be misused if we don't pay attention.  It is not a cinema masterpiece but it works.  I like that the characters seem to have more humanity rather than just being depicted as stereotypes.,1429833600,,479,4.534883720930233

382215,5,6301928008,This movie is very interesting. It takes place shortly after the end of the war when two very interesting and discusting things were happening in our country. One was the Senate/Army/McCarthy hearings and the other was that the government was bringing former Nazi scientists to America. The movie is about government corruption and the governments willingness to destroy an ordinary citizens live to protect their dirty little secret.,1423526400,,434,5.397058823529412

382218,5,6301928008,"Never saw it until recently.  Very well done period story.  Background of McCarthyism with plot of sneaking ex-Nazis into the country.  I loved the period backgrounds:  Old cars, furnishings, clothing, banter, etc.  Probably an under-rated movie.  Interesting to see 'Saul' from Homeland (Mandy ---) as a much younger actor.  Not perfect, but pretty good.",1413849600,,355,5.462962962962963
382219,4,6301928008,"Good Atmosphere, A Movie You Can Sink Into and Enjoy

I enjoyed the atmosphere of this film, especially the location shots in New York.  The scenes where Kelly McGillis is reading to  Jessica Tandy are drenched in subtle mystery and suspense--very lace curtain gothic.  I especially appreciated the moment when Ms. Tandy, who is very elderly, encourages Kelly McGillis to throw a rock into a window to ascertain if the house is occupied. The ensuing action is very well done, with a balance of tenderness and terror. Pure escapism.",1409616000,,531,4.932584269662922

382227,3,6301928008,"Worth seeing for the largely untold/ignored facts on which it is based re US importation of Nazi scientists after the War -- and not only to build rockets. Strong performances, especially by KellyMCGillis, Mandy Patinkin & Jeff Daniels. But the script and resulting action are slow moving, the film's chief problem. Still, I highly recommend this  well-targeted film.",1400976000,,367,5.327586206896552

382231,2,6301928008,"The House on Carroll Street, 1988 film

The movie begins with a view of a cemetery. A man walks along the graves. Next there is a Senate hearing in NY. Miss Emily Crane is summoned as a witness; she is a photo editor for a large circulation weekly magazine. She refuses to hand over the information demanded, and is cited for contempt. Back at work she is fired. The parked cars say it is the early 1950s. Emily goes to look for another job; a reader for an elderly wealthy woman. While relaxing in the backyard she hears a conversation in a foreign language. She recognizes a face in that room. The next scene tells about the doctors: they are technicians (or something). Emily meets a young man and they talk. What is the secret? Later two men from the FBI search her rooms; she is a suspect. [Never keep records or documents in your rooms.] A man calls her on the phone, she meets him in a famous bookstore. ""Run!"" They join a group in a theater. ""How do you get out of here?"" Somebody stabs the young man.

The police question Emily. She tells about Ray Solwin at that house. Emily remembers those spoken names. She finds an uninvited visitor in her rooms. ""What do you want?"" ""Does it concern you?"" Emily breaks into that house, and searches the rooms. There is a surprise from a man with a knife. She is rescued by another man. What is special about that book? They visit a ship at a dock. Next a wedding party. Emily snoops again. ""We have met before."" Emily enters a church, then is taken away to a restaurant. Ray Solwin is there, and talks to her. ""No one else knows."" Emily returns home, and is warned by her new friend Mike Cochrane, FBI agent. Soon there is a big noise. The next morning her friend explains his work. They are friendlier now. Emily visits Grand Central Station. The trains go north to Albany, west to Buffalo, then on to Chicago. Emily snoops on the train. She runs away again. Mike meets her again. Another man meets them. Emily flees again. She is pursued. Ray finds her! Run, Emily, run. There is a chase, then gravity does its thing. Mike Cochrane enters the railroad coach to make arrests. Later the case is wrapped up. Mike is transferred to Butte Montana, he is finally off the case. ""Take care of yourself."" ""I have nothing to say.""

The film tries to recreate New York City in the early 1950s. But only a few men wear hats, and few ladies wear white gloves. The non-actors smile when on-camera. This story is below average. It seems the story was put together by a committee with conflicting aims, and lacks focus. It is based on facts but hides it well. It seems like a message movie which suffers from wishful thinking. It could not have been a box-office success. Anyone who knows the history of the early 20th century would know of the fascist sympathies of the big corporations, and their flunkies or agents in the government.",1302912000,,2870,4.452471482889734
382232,4,6301928008,"Emily Crane (Kelly McGillis) works for Life magazine but her loyalty to Liberty Watch, an organization devoted to civil liberties, gets her fired. This highly educated woman settles for a job reading aloud to Miss Venable (Jessica Tandy) whose eyes are failing. Standing outside of the house on Carroll Street she hears - or more like eavesdrops on - a conversation she wasn't supposed to hear and soon begins to make inquiries, bringing the FBI to her door and trouble to her life. And when she befriends a young immigrant, she puts her life in danger.

FBI Agent Mike Cochran (Jeff Daniels) doesn't like the big city, but New York isn't so bad once he meets Emily. He becomes her protector.

I didn't like Salwen (Mandy Patinkin). He was so casual and smug about the whole situation as if he had no part in it. He was an evil man and his presence bothered me.

I really like movies that take place in the 40's and 50's. This one takes place in 1951, I believe, and it was intriguing and saddening at times. There is very little profanity and brief nudity that had nothing to do with the sex scene, which was left to the imagination (so unlike most movies today). The German speaking parts are interpreted by another character, which was nice since I don't speak the language, but it would have been nice to have subtitles on the few occasions when there was no interpretation.",1274659200,,1378,4.57085020242915
382233,3,6301928008,"Good thriller. No way compares to ""House on 92nd Street"". Format is different. ""House on Carroll Street"" is a movie, while ""House on 92nd Street"" is a documentary intertwined into a movie...very interesting approach. For simple entertaining, I recommend it. However, it's contingent on the audience's viewpoint.",1239321600,2,311,5.638297872340425
382234,4,6301928008,"""The house on Carol Street"" is a bold look about these tense times of furious McCarthyism (1951) in which a young assistant refuses to answer certain information that's why she must be fired. Once the decision ahs been made, she has to earn her life, and decides to take as job as reader of a crusty employer (the unforgettable Jessica Tandy), by just $15 by week.

But trying to get the exact address, she meets a man who behaves nervously, that will be the thread that will lead her to get involved with a Nazi smuggling web that surreptitiously deals with undesirable refugees. On the road she will be involved in a fugacious love affair with a FBI agent. Mandy Patinkin is fabulous as the main villain in this likable film directed by the talented Peter Yates, that knew to impress all the possible realism that certainly remits us to Hitchcokian sequences (as the well made one in Central Station).
