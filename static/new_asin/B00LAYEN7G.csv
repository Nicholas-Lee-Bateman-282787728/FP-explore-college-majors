6478869,5,B00LAYEN7G,My son is a Thomas fanatic. We watch this atleast twice a night.  Very cute movie!,1412985600,,82,4.125
6478870,3,B00LAYEN7G,"The quality of the animation in Tale of the Brave is the best yet for a Thomas movie. The songs, not so much, but we are given one song ""Monsters Everywhere"" that is not like standard Thomas fare. The animation that goes along with the song is some of the strangest ever seen in a Thomas movie. The story is ok, yet predictable and is pretty much spoiled by any fan of the toys. I have on question.. where's Oliver? He's in the trailer and there's a toy for him, but he's not in the movie.

Overall, not the best Thomas movie, not the worst, but my boys (5 1/2, 2 1/2) still enjoy it. Our 2 1/2 loves the ""Monsters Everywhere"" song and kept asking for us to play it!",1412899200,,666,4.083969465648855
6478871,1,B00LAYEN7G,"Gave my children nightmares!!!
.
I am so mad I could cuss!
.
Who looked at the imagery used to tell this story and said ""...yeah, that looks good"" ?  Tom Savini?  OK, it is not THAT horrifying.  But to three children under the age of 5; this has been the cause of sleepless nights and NOW fear of the dark!
.
Did they even test screen this for audiences age appropriateness; being that it is (NR) Not Rated, I would say Negative Ghost Rider!
.
(fill-in the blank) you very much Mr. Rob Silvestri, ARC Productions, and HIT Entertainment!

I thought I could trust you, but now I know better.

6478873,3,B00LAYEN7G,"My 2 1/2 year old really liked it, BUT there is a lot of talk about being scared and ""monsters"".  It was a little bit too much for the little guy; we had to talk about what it meant.  The songs are not that great, but the visuals are the best yet.",1411516800,2,247,3.730769230769231
6478874,2,B00LAYEN7G,"The story is fun but the engines/sir Topham Hatt/Cranky and everyone else in the movie are all voiced the same. My son is a huge Thomas fan and he watched in confusion at the new shared voice. We definitely preferred the other movies with their individual voices. Even though we like the new story it just loses something, too bad because we were looking forward to a new movie.",1411430400,,378,4.492753623188406
6478875,5,B00LAYEN7G,"We have a young Thomas enthusiast whose previous favorite (seemingly on a continuous loop) was Blue Mountain Mystery. That may now have been usurped judging my the squeals of glee our viewing elicited. Not too scary, though very exciting. Eye-popping animation with nice themes about friendship and what real bravery means. The new engine Gator is friendly and fun and the mayhem of landslides and imagined (?) monsters is engaging and lively. True to the spirit of the best Thomas tales, with some great songs and a very heroic Cranky, this Percy-centric tale is destined for endless repeats, an avalanche of playsets and cheerful fun for young and old alike. Highly recommended for Thomas fans!",1410825600,4,696,5.060869565217391
6478886,5,B00LAYEN7G,I purchased this as a gift for my son. It's yet another wonderful Thomas & Friends movie. In this adventure the engines explore and face their fears. It's a great example for young children.,1421798400,,190,4.617647058823529

6478906,3,B00LAYEN7G,"What can I say, Thomas gets into shenanigans once again. Only this time it's not near as good. The songs aren't as catchy, the storyline is about scary monsters (slightly sketchy for my 3 almost 4 yr old) and Percy talks way too much. We had to buy it bc clearly its Thomas and his friends but I don't recommend it for the suffering parent. This is no Day of the Diesels my friend, turn it on and find something else to do with your time.",1415318400,,438,4.104651162790698

6478914,4,B00LAYEN7G,"The kids really liked this movie.  There seemed to be more songs in it than usual and they are very catchy...the kids sing them a lot and then they get stuck in Mom and Dad's head.

The subject matter is pretty good too, dealing with fear and being brave.  Two of mine get frightened when watching cartoons and ""scary"" scenes, so I was worried that parts of this would be too scary for them but they did good throughout.

The story is about Thomas coming across a strange footprint in the quarry during a rainstorm and mudslide.  It talks about engines being brave by putting themselves at risk to save other engines.  Thomas tells Percy about the footprint he saw and Percy begins to worry about a monster and gets all overworked.  The other engines eventually buy into it, Gator, a new engine, helps Percy with being brave and in the end, Percy has to face his fears to save another engine who was teasing him.",1413590400,,912,4.457831325301205

If you want to watch Digitally, you are better off ordering directly from VUDU, etc. Which I ended up doing.

8664912,5,B00LAYEN7G,"We are big fans of Thomas the Tank Engine in our  house. Its my favorite of my son's shows that he likes to watch. This movie is one of the better Thomas offerings of feature-length format. There are catchy songs and a good story.

The Blu Ray picture quality is simply fantastic. I felt like springing for an HD copy of this movie was excessive, but the Thomas episodes on PBS are in HD, so I went ahead and bought it and do not regret it.

I highly recommend this for any and all Thomas and Friends fans of all ages.",1483833600,,518,4.108910891089109
