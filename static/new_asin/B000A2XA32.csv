It's partly my fault, for expecting a documentary on her life where there are interviews, or even a glimpse of her on the red carpet waving at the flashing cameras... When I saw that all there was to this was random still pictures with a narrorator talking in the background, and an occasional LOOOOOONG and boring unedited interview with someone who used to know a guy who had a brother that knew a guy that worked with her in her early years, I was bummed.

My aggrivation with purchasing this DVD really took off though when the screen went black for over a minute. Thinking it was my dvd player or tv, I started adjusting things... When nothing worked, I rewound the footage to reveal that---Oh yes---this DVD really WAS cheaply produced to the point that nobody noticed a full minute of no sound and no picture, and then it blipped back in mid-sentance. I video-edit as a hobby, and could have EASILY made a far-better latifah documentary with my consumer's pinnacle software.

Go online, print of a bunch of pictures of her for free, and then comment over the top of them while you hold them up for the same experience, because I garauntee you will know just as much about her life as the narrorator, and you'll save yourself five bucks.",1219104000,7,1468,4.553030303030303
