8254705,1,B00149JKD4,"one of the worst movies of all times.  c movie.  when she started to sing that hyme...and dance..i couldn't take it anymore. i had to shut it off.  i really don't think nuns in real life go bleach blond either.  that made it unreal from the start. they should have had the ""bad"" twin wear a blond wig.  dark brown eyes made it obvious. not even worth a dollar to rent thru a redbox at walmart stores.  not recommended.  some okay parts tho. not enough for me to finish watching.",1212278400,2,478,4.2444444444444445
