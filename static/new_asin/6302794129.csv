513807,5,6302794129,"Don't get me wrong. I love AMADEUS and CUCKOO's NEST etc. But this was just such a quietly funny and enjoyable film, I have to say it may almost be my favorite from Milos Forman. I think I first heard it spoken of by James Mangold(in the commentary for his film HEAVY). Mangold was in awe of Milos Forman and also enjoyed Ozu's films. That being said, I was quite excited for the dvd to be released, and was not at all dissapointed in the film. It's really funny and heartbreaking-I loved it.",1018828800,2,492,4.301075268817204
513808,4,6302794129,"Ivan Passer and Milos Forman, who wrote the screenplay of LOVES OF A BLONDE in 1965, left Czechoslovakia for Hollywood 30 years ago. While Milos Forman directed some hits like ONE FLEW OVER A CUCKOO'S NEST or AMADEUS, Ivan Passer had a less successful career, in terms of boxoffice, even if one can consider his movie CUTTER'S WAY (1981) as one of the most important american films of the eighties. So no wonder if Criterion has chosen to present this winter the two movies they wrote together back in the 60's : LOVES OF A BLONDE and FIREMEN'S BALL.
LOVES OF A BLONDE is a bittersweet comedy, in fact less sweet than bitter, relating the anxieties of the young women of an industrial small town. These girls are desperately looking for the man of their dreams while the male population of the town doesn't exceed the tenth of the female number. So when Andula is seduced by the pianist of a Praguan band and is invited to come to his place if she ever comes to the Czechoslovakian capital, she doesn't hesitate. Needless to say that the pianist will be a little annoyed when Andula knocks at his parents's door in the middle of the night.
So one smiles a lot during LOVES OF A BLONDE, particularly at the ball scene involving middle-aged reservists soldiers who can't believe their eyes in front of the numerous women available for dancing. One smiles a little less as an almost documentary camera lingers on the girl's faces waiting to be invited for a dance. Tragedy is never far away in this movie you can not disregard if you're interested in the revival of european cinema during the 60's.
The bonus features include a deleted scene and a recent video interview of Milos Forman. Sound and images superb even if a vertical black line is visible during the first minutes of the film.

513809,4,6302794129,"A small story about small events; young girls in a factory town looking for love and being mostly disappointed. Still, it resonates, mostly due to Forman's choice of images. Strange how a movie about stultifying desperation can also be funny and not entirely hopeless. Another good one from Forman.",948844800,,298,5.1020408163265305
513828,5,6302794129,"""Loves of a blonde"" is a bitter, nostalgic and crude gaze around the lives, customs, social prejudices and nave hopes of Czech Socialist Republic by then (1965), hilariously supported and featured as a modern fairy tale.

A very young woman falls in love with a pianist in occasion of a party. And since that impetuous love affair, she will make the best she can in order to maintain alive and materialize the eternal promises love, the lovers use to say.

The picture mirrors in a memorable and smart introduction, the affective necessities of the human being in that initial dialogue between an avid entrepreneur and an officer.

The nothing glamorous meeting between her and the parents of his fiance, will arouse al kind of laughs due the sudden clash of two well different generations.

A film that breathes humankind and reminds us the love is in everywhere, no matter social barriers or contrasted points of view: the love will always will find an exit door.

Remarkable film that although is a bit dated, constitutes a brilliant psychological exploration about the state of social fermentation that it was nestling in those years.",1191628800,,1138,4.93717277486911
513829,5,6302794129,"Director Forman's breakthrough feature in his native country portrays a warm, affecting humanity even as it lampoons the inherent awkwardness and mystery of relations between the sexes. In all, this deceptively simple, charming story tackles the complex question of how love can function in a dysfunctional world. Both young leads are enormously appealing, particularly Brejchova, and those parents of Milda's are also worth the wait. All in all, this is one blonde that's easy to love.",1182988800,,486,5.407894736842105
513830,4,6302794129,"Milos Forman's ""Loves of a Blonde"" which he made in Czechoslovakia in 1965 way before ""Cuckoo Nest"" and ""Amadeus"" tells a very simple bitter-sweet tale about a teenaged girl who works in a shoe factory in a small town. With sixteen girls to one man - her chances to find a man of her dreams were not very high. One evening, she meets an attractive and young piano player who tells her about Prague and compares her to a guitar that could've been painted by Picasso. After they spend the night together, he leaves and she travels to Prague to find him. The film has been one of my favorites for many years and my opinion did not change after I saw it again recently - funny, sad, tender, and realistic film about searching for love, broken promises, shattered hearts, and universality of hope.

513831,5,6302794129,"A comedy of sorts about first love, though ultimately a sad movie, too, as befitting the subject. A factory town outside of Prague has a mismatch of 16 girls for every boy, so a group of army recruits are sent to liven things up. Only they're a wash-out, and the scene with the girls trying to get out of having to go with these duds and vice-versa is pretty funny.

At a dance, Andula (Hana Brejchova) falls for the piano player Milda (Vladimir Pucholt) and spends the night with him. He is just interested in a one-night stand and uses all the come-on lines he can think of to get her to spend the night with him, including his wish for her to come visit him in Prague and meet his parents. Andula naively falls for all this and goes to his house in Prague, where Milda's parents bully her for being there (they bully Milda, too). He does nothing to defend her and she leaves - but tells all her friends back home what a great time she had.

The movie is very comical in spots and very honest, but Andula is so naive and used, and so accepting of the abuse dished out to her, that we feel sad watching her and pity her greatly. It's this mixture of humor and pity that makes the movie so remarkable. We also pity Czechoslovakia, which appears utterly depressing a place as depicted here. An excellent movie, the one that made Milos Forman a highly respected director.",1132963200,4,1369,4.34375
513832,4,6302794129,"This Criterion edition includes an interveiw with Forman that sheds a lot of light on how this film was constructed. The use of long singles, especially when the pianist's mother and father are in dialogue, was undoubtedly influenced by budget constraints, but Forman makes an aesthetic choice to linger on the mother while she wears down all around her with her world-weary nagging. The effect is that you get to share what the husband, son and protagonist are going through; ""Get me away from this woman, please!"" The expressions on the faces of both the professionals and amateurs in the cast tell the story not only of drudgery under an oppressive political regime, but the hopes and despairs that people suffer in the kind of fraught romantic episodes the story is woven around. Andula's story is not quite compelling enough to justify the price tag on this DVD - there is a whole episode involving a missing ring and an enraged suitor that pops up and disappears without much relevance. Modern cinema-goers expect more meat to a story, I think. However, budding filmmakers will learn a lot about pacing, reaction from actors, not moving the camera, and the difference between directing professional and non-professional actors (in the Extras interview).",1132531200,7,1259,5.028708133971292
513833,5,6302794129,"Andula (Hana Brejchova) is a young factory worker who lives in a dorm with other young women in the dreary town of Zruc during Communist rule in Czechoslovakia.  Life is empty and unfulfilling, and boys are scarce.  Andula, a girl with a sad past of her own that is only hinted at, seeks escape from hopelessness in love.

Lest the above description seem too depressing, let me add that this film is often very funny, particularly in a scene where a trio of middle-aged reservists approach Andula and her friends at a social mixer.  Director Milos Forman states in an interview that part of his motivation for making films was in reaction against the absurd socialist realism school of the time, which depicted socialist societies as paradises on earth.  In this seemingly slight film about a young girl's romance, he shows much of the unhappiness and hopelessness of such a society while also presenting his characters with great warmth and affection.  The actors in this film are wonderful and natural, with great faces.  Forman observes human behavior very closely and emerges with a story about people with whom everyone can empathize, delivering once again the valuable lesson of any great film--no matter where or when we were born, we are more like each other than unlike./",1091664000,3,1280,4.898148148148148
513834,5,6302794129,"Here's another great film that sprung forth from the Czech New Wave: another film that, through its small gestures and subtleties makes some big statements. I'll leave it for you all to discover Forman's delightful insights into human behavior in LOVES OF A BLONDE. Suffice it to say, the plot---which involves a young girl's (Hana Brejchov) attempt to find true love as a factory girl---could have become whimsical and even sentimental in other hands. In Forman's, the whole thing is grounded on earth. Instead of being a weightless romantic comedy, LOVES OF A BLONDE aims for realism, and while Forman maintains a relatively light touch on the proceedings, everything that happens to her---she finds love in a piano player, makes love to him one night, and then eventually pursues him to his home, where she meets his ever-bickering parents---still has its own kind of weight to it. The only way I can describe it is, I guess, the weight of real life. I haven't seen a more accurate recreation of a marriage that has dulled out in any other movie than I saw in the second half of LOVES OF A BLONDE, with Milda's parents: it is comic, yes, but it is also uncannily realistic, and maybe you'll recognize your own parents when you see the control-freak mother and the carefree father in this film. As for the blonde of the movie...well, she doesn't necessarily become sympathetic as the movie progresses, but we get a sense of why she begins to attach herself to the piano player Milda: she sees him as an escape from the drudgeries of factory life. Understand that, and you'll find the ending of this film poignant and maybe kinda sad. (Her dream has been shattered, but she keeps on believing it anyway, either out of hope or simply desperation.)

  But enough of my pretentious analysis, hehe. The point is, Milos Forman's LOVES OF A BLONDE, like Jiri Menzel's arguably more celebrated CLOSELY WATCHED TRAINS, is a film that, though short at 85 minutes, takes its time to observe human nature in the face of oppression, in its own light and subtle way. Its comic surface only makes it seem like a slight movie; but in its subtleties and scenes of comic observation, it has a heck of a lot more to say about our little human foibles than a lot of other romantic comedies do. Recommended.",1091059200,,2288,4.7007481296758105
513835,4,6302794129,"Milos Forman doesn't get the respect he deserves amongst the ranks of the great foreign directors.  This is probably because he has made mostly English language films, but I would still put him up there. Having seen this film though, it makes sense. One has to look no further than Loves of a Blonde to see this man easily had the potential to make great movies...in any language.
Loves of a Blonde focuses on a few days in the life of teenager named Andula.  She lives in a town with a female-to-male ratio of sixteen to one.  At a singles mixer, while several bumbling military men try to hit on Andula and her two girlfriends, she meets a piano player named Rilda.  Things pick up quickly with Rilda and she eventually hitches to Prague to hook up with him.  The situation turns out to be a little different than she expected as she finds him still living with his conservative parents.
This film is charming.  Forman is on top of his game blending comedy and social comment almost seamlessly.  The narrative structure is unique too.  At the center of the picture is Andula, she is the antagonist for most of the film's action, but the film allows the supporting players to be the main focus of the scenes they are in.  Andula watches, she listens, she reacts, and while the story is ultimately about her coming of age, it is her interaction with the people around her that make this story interesting.
From One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to Amadeus to The People vs. Larry Flynt, Milos Forman always delivers.  This film is no exception, and it has stood the test of time.  So if you like those films check out Loves of a Blonde.",1043452800,5,1634,4.486486486486487
513836,5,6302794129,"The premise of the story is funny-- a village full of women factory workers who live crammed together in dorms needs men so the factory owner charmingly pleads with the military to send an attachment of men to the town to give his girls something to do with their evenings but when the men show up they are all middle aged, the young girls are disappointed. What is even funnier is Formans attitude and style which borrows some tricks in cutting and impromptu time shifts from the French New Wave directors but adds to this famous style a lucid charm that is irresistable. The cutting techniques innovated by the French New Wave directors emphasized the looseness and spontaneity of life but Formans sense of humor is such that he cannot help parodying the techniques he is emulating. For instance in the dance hall sequence the camera slowly pans the feet of the band members which makes for an absurdly enjoyable incidental.  French New Wave in technique but the humor is charmingly Czech in tone. The storyline makes some poignant observations about the new social mores of the 1960's--a married soldier trying to meet girls drops his wedding ring and proceeds to watch it roll across the dance floor where it falls to rest beneath a table of single girls. The title character dreams of a young man to take her away from her grim life as factory worker living in a dorm full of girls but since the men she meets do not take her away she decides to take matters into her own hands and follows one to his hometown. But arriving there she is greeted only with more grim reality. She returns home to her factory job and dorm and finds solace in make-believe as she tells her girlfriends a version of the events which conforms to her dreams. Very touching, wise, and satisfying film from a filmmaker who exhibits a fondness for all his characters. No one escapes Formans lighthearted satire nor his  empathy which embraces all forms of life, young and old. Remarkably light and poignant at the same time.  Czech and Polish films of this period strike an irresistable chord and are some of the most irresistable films ever made. Also recommended: Closely Watched Trains.",1043280000,9,2167,4.697368421052632
513837,4,6302794129,"Milos Forman made a name for himself with Czech new wave films that challenged the old order with slyly defiant themes of freedom in all its personal and political manifestations.  Two of his landmark early films have been restored in image and sound and digitally transferred in clean, crisp-looking prints with improved English subtitles.
Forman earned his first Academy Award  nomination with ""LOVES OF A BLOND"". In 1966, when it premiered in America at the New York Film Festival, it was an immediate sensation.  Even Bosley Crowther, the notoriously tight-laced chief critic for the pompous New York Times could hardly contain himself when he experienced this efficacious, subtle social satire disguised as an exploration of adolescent romantic desire. The story is set in the rural Czech town of Zruc.  With a ratio of sixteen women to every man, the chances of factory worker Andula finding love are indeed slim. That is until her giggling girl friends talk her into going to a mixer where she meets Rilda, a devil-may-care piano player from Prague.  As the three acts unfold, there's a feeling of real time as issues of intimacy, confinement, dreams, delusions, reality and freedom are explored in the context of their relationship  And there's nothing preachy or heavy-handed like some other films of the era that are infected with a deadly hidden political agenda that numbs any entertainment value.  This one is pure.  Universal in its humanity, the romance of Andula and Milda mirrors all our hopes and fears. Extras include a new video interview with Forman, a deleted scenes and new English subtitles.
In many ways, this film is linked to another that is worth noting.
""THE FIREMAN'S BALL"" takes place in tiny Czech village of the 60s.  Every year the firmen put on a ball and this is a look at the whacky goings.  Real townspeople mostly play themselves in this dark comic satire of life under Soviet style communism.  Funny, scary and meaningful.  The tone is not unlike ""American Beauty"" in that the naked truth is sharply revealed.
High praise to Criterion for continuing the tradition of gathering the greatest films from the finest filmmakers around the world and publishing them in editions that offer the highest technical quality and award-winning, original supplements.",1019088000,17,2293,5.069148936170213

7831482,4,6302794129,"The Loves of a Blond (1965) together with The Firemen's Ball (1967) are the most accomplished films of Milos Forman who soon afterwards emigrated from Czechoslovakia.  Forman is considered by many the father of Czechoslovak New Wave school, and The Loves of a Blond is undoubtedly the symbol of that New Wave.  What I like about this film (and The Firemen's Ball is identical in that aspect) is that this is a film with a simple story line, that involves simple folks (like you and me) and the dialogue feels very sponetnous...as if the actors and actresses did not have a script to go by...even the actors and actresses feel like ordinary people who were taken from the street.

The film is about a young factory girl who one day during a town-celebration meets a young musician.  The two spend a night together,
and the girl (who happens to be very nave and good natured) falls for the guy.  Unfortunately, the guy leaves with his band for Prague the following morning.

7831487,5,6302794129,"Coming of age films rarely get better treatment than they do in this beautifully sincere 1965 film from Academy Award winning director Milos Forman (`Amadeus').  `Lasky Jedne Plavovlasky' takes it upon itself to show us the simple yet complicated (quite simply complicated) life of an adolescent girl and her search for love.

In a country (Czechoslovakia) where the ratio of women to men (sixteen women to every one man) would make it extremely difficult to insure loving monotony, young factory worker Andula sacrifices her own rationality when she meets the charming piano player Milda.  After a hesitant yet blissful one night stand, Andula thinks that she is in love, and worse yet, she thinks the feeling is mutual.  When she actually travels to see him she finds that what she thought was love may not be that at all.

The film is told in merely a few long scenes that really help give the appearance of real time / real life, and I felt that this aspect of the film was most becoming.  It's a simple structure, without very much movement in the form of action.  There is a dance party scene, a love scene, a small bicker and then a long reuniting scene.  It's almost broken out like a stage play, but it doesn't feel theatrical in any way, shape or form.  The film is beautifully controlled and completely realistic.  Every mannerism, conversation and gut reaction feels genuine and honest.

A big aid to that is the acting.

The beautiful (if oddly so) Hana Brejchova adds such a quiet vulnerability to Andula.  She appears so natural, so sincere, and I adore that about her.  It's a very observational performance in that she seems to just sit back and take everything in around her, her eyes trying to grasp all that she is seeing; yet she never appears desperate or yearning.  It's a really sublime acting accomplishment.  It's so quiet that her eventual breakdown becomes so much more heartbreaking; and then that conclusion, lying in bed with her friend, her words just...such a powerful statement!

Vladimir Pucholt is remarkable and maliciously charming as Milda, and both Milada Jezkova and the magnificent Josef Sebanek are brutally honest as Milda's parents.  They come together effortlessly to elevate the films core.

It is a simple film in that there isn't a lot going on, but it is within the film's simplicity that it really exposes so much.  If you have a short attention span then I might let this one go by, beings that the distilled conversations and long pauses may prove meandering for you, but if you are intrigued by subtle yet poignant character studies, then you really can't do much better than this!",1256169600,,2635,4.787610619469026

The visual aspect of the film is ""gritty reality"" not beautiful Prague. Somehow I was taken on a trip back in time.  Every harsh encounter I ever had with a love interest was revisited. Every stab of rejection was made to bleed again. Within this psychological voyage, is also a great deal of humor. I feel humor is what keeps us all interested in continued breathing.
The enterview with Milos Forman really made the disk worth owning.  I love the fact that he uses many nonactors and that much of their reaction is their own interpretation.",1203292800,,734,4.375

The story: Milda, a young pianist goes to drab industrial small town to play one night, meets the bird-brained working class blonde Andula during the ball, they make love at his hotel room, he returns to Prague, she breaks with her boyfriend after a fight, and decides to go to Prague to meet Milda. As it happens, the pianist lives with his parents, who are totally opposed with Andula staying at their rundown apartment (not that Milda wants her to stay). It is a quite artless film, and it is also ugly the way Andula is treated throughout.
