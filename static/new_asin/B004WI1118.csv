8445104,5,B004WI1118,"Alessandro Avellis made if feature film debut with Ma Saison Super 8, a wonderful period piece about the gay rights movement in the 1970's.  He follows that up with a slice of life film from the streets of Paris.  Avellis uses three main characters, two men and a woman as the crux of the story. They come together to learn to live and each grows up in their own way.  But it is the City of Paris that really stars in this film.  Short in muted colors, sepia tones or basic black and white the city comes alive in ways not normally presented in most cinema.  The dirty underground, begging on the streets, playing for food on the metro, these are all presented in a matter of fact way that is compelling and shocking.
A love story set in the modern world, Paname is a wonderful look into today's youth culture",1303171200,3,809,4.33112582781457
