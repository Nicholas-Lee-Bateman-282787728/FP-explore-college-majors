2023785,5,B0001PKFLS,I had never seen this movie but I read that this is the movie he was most proud of and I agree the movie was really well done the entire cast was wonderful and Sinatra was very believable as Frankie. Pop some popcorn and sit back and enjoy this one I loved it!!!,1483920000,,262,3.9622641509433962
2023786,5,B0001PKFLS,I saw this piece of film noire when it first appeared in 1955 and it is as good now as it was then. Sinatra puts in his very best performance as the addict and the music is rivetingly poignant. To escape the depressing horror of the environment is the real message of the movie and Kim Knovak is the guardian angel which makes it possible. Superb movie.,1482451200,,353,4.2835820895522385

2023790,5,B0001PKFLS,"Two things about this. First, in streaming video it's a lousy print. Looks like a kinescope of a 50s TV show. Second, in general I don't like Otto Preminger movies, which mostly seem to me wooden and self-important. But this is a great movie, even if one of tremendous sadness. Sinatra is acting powerfully, so is Kim Novak who wasn't really that much of an actress. Even Arnold Stang is terrific, of all people. And Darren McGavin, who was a generic character actor, is creepily marvelous here. The portrayal of heroin addiction may not be strictly realistic, but it's visceral and unforgettable, and Sinatra is up to it. Maybe the Elmer Bernstein music is laid on a bit thick in the course of the movie, but his title theme is brilliant, apropos, and unforgettable. The movie in the 50s atmosphere of gritty social drama in which Elia Kazan specialized, and it's up to his level, which is saying a lot. I applaud the moral ambiguity of everything and everybody here. For once with Preminger, it's got a big helping of subtlety. Bravo all around,.",1477008000,,1048,4.701086956521739
2023791,5,B0001PKFLS,"This is a great Sinatra classic directed by none other than Otto Preminger. Sinatra plays his part to perfection as the once addicted heroin addict, recently out of prison and hoping to make a new start in life. Sinatras wife, played by Eleanor Parker is playing games with Sinatra, pretending to be unable to walk when she is not disabled. She smothers poor Sinatra and keeps him from realizing his dreams. Then, along comes the beautiful Kim Novak, Sinatras apartment neighbor, who encourages him to become a drummer.

It isn't long, however, before Sinatra runs into bad, old friends who lead him down a path of destruction. Soon Sinatra is back on drugs and working as an illegal card dealer.

This story has lots of twists and turns in its plot. A really gripping film from beginning to end! A really MUST WATCH!

 The film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Sinatra as Best Actor and Elmer Bernstein for Best Music. The BAFTAs and The New York Film Critics also nominated Sinatra for this film for Best Actor.",1474588800,,1030,4.737430167597766
2023792,5,B0001PKFLS,"Amazing work by all in the cast.  Arnold Stang is really convincing as the ""weaselly"" buddy character and Darren McGavin is great as the despicable pusher.  Kim Novak and Sinatra keep you rooting for the underdog throughout.  I've become a big fan of Preminger and this is one of his best.",1472428800,,289,4.627450980392157
2023793,5,B0001PKFLS,"Frank Sinatra should have gotten another Oscar for his performance in this incredible drama, as should Elmer Bernstein for the music score.  This is one of the most intense movies of that era.  It was packaged as perfectly as an egg.  See, and learn of the plight of the junkie.",1470441600,,278,4.52
2023794,4,B0001PKFLS,"I recently saw a documentary of the life of the American author Nelson Algren (1909 -- 1981) titled, ""The End is Nothing, the Road is All"", which prompted me to read Algren's most famous novel, ""The Man with the Golden Arm"". In 1950, Algren's novel won the first National Book Award. I had never seen the 1955 movie adaptation, but took the opportunity to watch it through Amazon Prime.

Otto Preminger directed the film and originally hired Algren to write the screen play. Unfortunately, the two did not get along and Algren was fired. Algren disliked the film which differs from the book in many ways.  Still, a film should be judged on its own and on whether it succeeds in its own medium. In that respect, I found the movie successful.  Frank Sinatra stars in the film as Frankie Machine, the ""man with the golden arm"" as a drug-addicted card dealer and is convincing in the role.  Other members of the case include Eleanor Parker as Frankie's wife Zosch and a sexy Kim Novak as his romantic flame, Molly. The movie features a brassy jazzy score by Elmer Bernstein which has acquired a life of its own.  The angular black-and white cinematography show the seedy Chicago streets, bars, and apartments in which most of the story takes place.

In the film, Frankie has been released from a brief prison term where he has kicked his addition and formed the dream of becoming a jazz drummer. He returns to his wife, who is confined to a wheelchair, intending to go straight but soon returns to his former life as a card dealer in illegal games and to has drug addiction. The film shows Frankie's relationships with his friend and sidekick Sparrow, with the drug peddler Louis, and with Swefka, the operator of the crooked card game. The movie shows these and other low life characters in post -- WW II Chicago.  The film was one of the first to portray drug addiction and its consequences.

The film shows the dynamics among the characters and the setting in the streets with a focus on Frankie's again become addicted and trying to break the habit. The resolution of the plot, the film's portrayal of its characters and of human nature, and its single-minded focus on drug addiction differ markedly from Algren's novel. But for the most part they work on their own terms. There is a toughness to Algren's vision, and feel for people, and a breadth and complexity in the novel that the film does not capture. Most importantly, the film cannot duplicate the lyrical, poetic quality of Algren's writing. The book is intense and complex and probably could not be fully captured in a film of two hours. With its limited, softer focus, this film does portray the life of addiction in a large city.

I was glad to have the opportunity to see this film, to enjoy it for itself, and to think about its relation to Algren's book which deserves to be better known. Viewers will enjoy this movie.  Those who  become interested in the film might consider following-up by reading Algren's outstanding novel.

 Frank Sinatra gave a stunning performance in this film, one of his best I think. Kim Novak was also amazing as his sultry and sympathetic friend as was the stellar supporting cast of characters, including Darren McGavin as the pusher.

As another reviewer has mentioned here, I don't think the timeline detracts from watching this film now. It's still relevant and provocative material, albeit taken in the context of a very different era, the late 40's that this was suppose to be set in.

The only thing I REALLY disliked was the musical score. I didn't find it added anything to this movie, just annoying, and repetitive not in a good way. I think the right music could have added so much to this film. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed this second viewing.

Frank Sinatra was one of those rare individuals who truly excelled at his two career paths: acting and singing. They don't make 'em like Blue Eyes anymore. His talent will live on though and that's the good part.",1416614400,,1099,4.586734693877551

I enjoyed the special features portraying director Otto Preminger and Frank Sinatra as both being tough uncompromising professionals. Its said that Preminger was incredibly hard to work for and bullied his actors except Frank who didn't take any crap from anybody.  Subsequently Preminger respected him for it and they worked very well together as Frank was a consummate professional.  ----THE MOVIE-----You know how it goes. One has to be into the subject matter and the movie is about a Drug Addict (Sinatra) and the trials and tribulations of being a junkie both in general and in the 50's.  Many people want to keep him hooked and in a weakened state so as to manipulate and control him including a woman in his life.

2023860,5,B0001PKFLS,"My all time favorite from Preminger.
This movie was shot in the mid 1950's during the time when America was preoccupied fighting communists in their backyard,
men were using tons of hair-gel, and young women dreamed of living in suburbia.  Frank Sinatra is outstanding in a role of his lifetime. Playing an off-beat card dealer in Chicago, Frankie Machine. Now---THAT IS A PRETTY COOL NAME.

We are introduced to Frankie just as he is released from the clinic for substance abuse.
His ""handicapped"" girlfriend Zoska awaits him (most likely Polish-American immigrant), and so do his old buddies: a mentally challenged/goofy looking dog groomer Sparrow, who so happens to be his only true male friend, his former employer the Schweifka the gambler/street hustler, and of course the drug dealer, who lives just across from him.  There is also the beautiful and caring Molly...a girl Frankie has been romancing while taking care of his ""handicapped"" girlfriend----SPOILER ALERT!!!---she is not really handicapped...but watch and see how the movie evolves.

-Frank Sinatra is mesmerizing as a heroin junkie/card dealer with no luck in his life.
-Kim Novak is very convincing as a love-stricken, caring, love interest of Frankie.
-Eleanor Parker is very memorable as a cunning femme fatale Zoska.
-The plot is intriguing.
-The movie is a melodrama, with good character study, and a touch of noire.",1386460800,,1391,5.2242152466367715

And like the 'olden days' - talks of a 'cure' rather than being 'in recovery'. The focus is on the symptoms such as 'using' or 'not using' - rather than the underlying reasons as to 'why'. Still this film deserves it's dues for at least getting this topic out there and getting the ball rolling with awareness of society. I have to admit - I forget already - but I think it's in black and white - as is the message - as if an addict is either 'sober' or 'not sober' - no grey areas in between, no therapy, no groups, no meetings. Too bad the movies now in days - have gone to the other extreme of aiming for 'shock' instead of substance (and I don't mean drugs). I have wanted to see this movie for some time, and now I have.

The acting is absolutely amazing.  Novak, Parker, and especially Sinatra give some the best performances on celluloid. The same is true for the supporting cast.

The writing, direction, and music are all just incredible as well.

My final verdict: not dated, but a classic in every way.  Part of the reason for this assessment has to do with all the factors I have just mentioned.  What I have spoken about so far is the execution of the theme and this execution is praiseworthy indeed. However, it is the theme itself of beating addiction that makes this such a very special winner of a movie.  Meth, crack, and a myriad of other drug addictions are still very much in existence today.  I thank God for this film that reminds us that the human spirit is far stronger than any pill, liquid, or powder that seeks to drag us down to Hell.

2023879,4,B0001PKFLS,"Once a junkie, always a junkie.  In this film Frank Sinatra has to deal with this.  He's cast as a card dealer in a illegal card came in an low class neighborhood in an unnamed city. He's just been released from jail and a drug rehabilitation program.  He's determined not to go back to drugs and his plans including getting a job as a drummer. There's temptation in the neighborhood though, especially since he starts dealing cards again.  It looks like he's on a downward spiral.

Eleanor Parker is cast as his wife who seems confined to a wheelchair.  She complains a lot and makes Sinatra feel guilty because of her paralysis.  She's annoying and nagging and not a very likable character, especially as we soon find out that she's faking her disability in order to bind Sinatra to her.  Kim Novak is cast as their downstairs neighbor who is in love with Sinatra.  She's absolutely gorgeous and is eye candy in every scene she is in.

With all the pressures on Frank, he is soon lured back into drugs and the tension mounts as we wonder how it will all turn out.

As far as the acting, everyone's performances were spotty.  Frank seemed a little stiff at the beginning.  Maybe it was because I think of him as ""the"" Frank Sinatra, it took a while for me to see him in this role.  But by the end of the film when he is going through withdrawal, I was just plain involved with the story and later felt his performance was outstanding.  As far as Eleanor Parker's performance went, I just couldn't get into it.  She's supposed to be a lower class person but this just did not come across, especially when she tried to imitate a New York Brooklyn accent.  It sounded so funny to me that I actually laughed out loud.  Kim Novak looked gorgeous as usual.  She is so type cast that her performance wasn't unique but she, too, seemed to not quite get the low class accent.  Another actor in this film was Arnold Stang, cast as Sinatra's sidekick.  He's a small comical guy with a whiny voice.  He is also type cast and played his role as expected.

As the recently-detoxed card dealer Frankie, Sinatra walks from rehab straight back into the belly of the beast, flaunting his sparkling new outlook on life before a block full of characters who know better than to trust any style of clean living will last long. At its core, this is a damning glimpse into the coal-black heart of addiction and withdrawal that doesn't limit itself strictly to drug use. While the most striking scenes are undoubtedly zoned in on Frankie's habit, particularly the brutal cold turkey scenes near the finale, in the supporting cast there's an equally poignant message about the similarities you'll find in the overuse of any intoxicating experience, whether it be heroin, gambling or love itself. An impressively fresh, open-minded picture that's less concerned with painting the drugs themselves in a poor light than it is the weak-willed men and women who overuse them.

In Otto Preminger's THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM (1955), Frank Sinatra and Eleanor Parker (as Frankie and Zosch Machine) give the performances of their careers.

Kim Novak's Molly, a rival for Frankie's affections, is one of two things that wheelchair-bound Zosch fears most. The other is a dirty trick Mrs. Machine has been pulling on the world ever since Frankie and she were in a car wreck. Parker's several moments of wild-eyed paranoia seem genuine; this actress knows how to immerse herself in a role and become the person she's playing.

Also here is Darren McGavin as slimeball 'H' pusher Louie. His siren song of a free first ""fix"" quickly lures Frankie from the straight and narrow path he found during a six months' stay at a correctional facility and put him back on the road to Hades. Robert Strauss is Schwiefka, operator of a floating card game who let Frankie take the fall during a raid, a pinch that sent ""the Machine"" to the state-run hospital.

Sinatra undoubtedly won his Best Actor nomination for a harrowing ""cold turkey"" sequence at Molly's flat. It's an astounding performance, truly his finest screen moment, ironically one that comes at the lowest point of his character's life. Also nominated was Elmer Bernstein's searing jazz score, a pounding music track that enhances an anguished, bleak reality-turned-nightmare tale, one which resolves tragically.

2023888,5,B0001PKFLS,"""The Moon Is Blue"" director Otto Preminger tackled even more taboo subject matter in his controversial 1955 release ""The Man with the Golden Arm."" Whereas Preminger had incensed the Motion Picture Association of America with his use of the words ""virgin"" and ""mistress"" in his mild 1953 comedy ""The Moon Is Blue,"" ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" went far beyond what any movie had attempted probably since the Dick Powell law and order saga ""To the Ends of the Earth"" (1946) about thwarting the international traffic in narcotics. Based on Nelson Algren's novel that won the 1950 National Book Award, this gritty, uncompromising 119-minute, black & white melodrama deals with heroin addiction.  Initially, when Preminger's film came out, the Motion Picture Association of America would not issue its seal of approval because the filmmakers depicted addiction to narcotics.  This groundbreaking film qualified as the first major motion picture to handle narcotics from the dope fiend's perspective and actually showed the paraphernalia that junkies wielded to shoot up heroin. The Production Code stipulated that filmmakers must refrain from showing characters using illicit narcotics.  Nevertheless, United Artists released this unique Frank Sinatra picture and it grossed over $4-million dollars.

The critical and commercial success of ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" eviscerated the Production Code. As a result, the MPAA amended the Code so that filmmakers could delve into other taboo subjects, such as drug abuse, kidnapping, abortion and prostitution. The film received three Academy Award nominations.  Oscar nominations went to Sinatra for Best Acting, Joseph C. Wright and Darrell Silvera for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White and Elmer Bernstein for Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture.  Indeed, Elmer Bernstein made a name for himself with his jazzy score. The producers had thought about casting Marlon Brando in the title role, but Sinatra beat Brando to the punch.  Eleanor Parker, Kim Novak, Arnold Stang, Darren McGavin, and Robert Strauss co-starred with Ole Blue Eyes.  McGavin was particularly memorable as a sleazy heroin dealer, while Eleanor Parker played the protagonist's wife with a dark, deep secret of her own that comes as quite a shock.

""The Man with the Golden Arm"" refers to protagonist Frankie Machine's ability to manipulate a deck of cards.  Frankie deals cards for Zero Schwiefka (Robert Strauss of ""Stalag 17"") but he has been out of Chicago for the last six months in a federal narcotics hospital recovering from heroin addiction.  Not only has Frankie licked the habit, but he also has learned how to play the drums and plans to embark of a music career.  Optimistic as Frank is about his future, he finds himself facing his past all over again when he returns to his old stomping grounds.  Schwiefka wants him to deal for him again, and Nifty Louie Fomorowski (Darren McGavin of ""Counter-Attack"") tries to induce him to resume his heroin usage.  Meanwhile, Frankie comes home to his invalid, wheel-chair bound wife, Zosh (Eleanor Parker of ""Escape from Fort Bravo""), who manipulates him with guilt. Frankie was drunk when he had a car accident and Zosh wound up in a wheel chair.  Frankie shows up with high hopes and a drum set, but Zosh sees no future for him as a musician and urges to go back to work for Schwiefka.  Frankie plans to visit a music promoting and one of his own friends, Sparrow (Arnold Stang of ""My Sister Eileen""), shoplifts a business suit from a department store for Frankie.  After Frankie refuses to work for Schwiefka because he is going to see musical agent Harry Lane (Will Wright of ""The Wild One""), Schwiefka turns both Frank and Sparrow into the police.  Meanwhile, Schwiefka gets Brach's Department Store to drop the shoplifting charges. The suit was worth $37.00.  Frankie agrees to resume dealing for Schweifka and the hustler bails him out.

Not long afterward, despite his resolution to shun heroin use, Frankie breaks down and pays Louie the $2.00 for a fix.  Eventually, Frankie meets Harry Lane and Lane warns him that he is catches Frankie shooting up that he will have nothing to do with him. What poor Frankie doesn't know is that Zosh has recovered her ability to walk, but she uses his guilt about the accident to hold on to him.  Zosh is also jealous of her downstairs neighbor, Molly Novotny (Kim Novak of ""Picnic""), Frankie's former sweetheart who hustles drinks at a nearby strip bar called the Safari Club.  When Zosh complains about headaches that Frankie gives her practicing on his drum set, Frankie moves them downstairs into Molly's apartment. Schwiefka and Louie are planning a big poker game with Sam Markette (George E. Stone of ""Guys and Dolls"") and Williams (George Mathews of ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral""), two big-time gamblers who have heard about Frank and his legendary `golden arm.'  Schwiefka and Louie persuade a reluctant Frankie to deal for $250. After an early winning streak, the cards go sour for Frankie and he starts losing.  In fact, Frankie spends about two days dealing.  Exhausted, his nerves shot and desperate for a fix,  he falls apart on the second day and Markette and Williams catch him cheating. Louie refuses to give Frankie a fix, so Frankie knocks him out and ransacks his apartment for the heroin.

Preminger pulls no punches in ""The Man with the Golden Arm,"" and the film is pretty disillusioning. None of the characters here are remotely sympathetic.  Essentially, they are either hustlers or hustled. Sinatra gives another dynamite performance as does McGavin and Parker. To be sure, ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" has lost much of its impact in the intervening 50 or more years, but it still ranks as a landmark film.

It's been a long time coming to finally get this pristine version on DVD. Not since the final days of LaserDisc when Warner's finally released a near perfect transfer of this movie, have I been waiting for them to do the same on DVD - and they did not disappoint (I tink it's actually the same transfer except this DVD is 1.85:1 and anamorphic wide screen - the original was academy ratio). This movie is actually in 'The Public Domain', that is, it is free to distribute and copy legally. So there are many versions of this movie floating around, often at the bargain bin of $5- or so... However this Warner's transfer is THE copy to get.  If you want to experience the beautiful B&W photography of Sam Leavitt in chrystal clarity or the remastered sound with Elmer Bernstein's Jazz score, then do yourself a favor and purchase immediately, it will not disappoint!",1222473600,,979,4.588571428571429

2023896,4,B0001PKFLS,"Part of this review was used to review Nelson Algren's book of the same name and on which the film was based.

Growing up in a post World War II built housing project this reviewer knew first hand the so-called `romance' of drugs, the gun, the ne'er do well hustler and the mechanisms one needed to develop to survive at that place where the urban working poor meet and mix with the lumpen proletariat- the con men, dopesters, grifters drifters and gamblers who feed on the downtrodden.  This is definitely not the mix that Damon Runyon celebrated in his Guys and Dolls-type stories. Far from it.

Nelson Algren has gotten, through hanging around Chicago police stations and sheer ability to observe, that sense of foreboding, despair and just plain oblivion of America's mean streets down pat in a number of works, including this one. Here the plot revolves around Frankie Machine an urban hustler with a jones (and more than just the dope jones, his whole life is twisted by the vagaries of his fate). Along the way we meet an array of stoolies, cranks, crackpots and nasty brutish people who are more than willing to put obstacles in the way of our anti-hero. And we have, at this point, not even mentioned his `home' life with his `ever-loving' disabled wife (or so he thinks). She might make anyone reach for the needle.

We, of late, have become rather inured to dope stories either of the death and destruction type or of the rehabilitation kind but at the time that this story was put together in the late 1940's this was something of an eye-opener for those who were not familiar with the seamy side of urban life. The dead end jobs, the constant run-ins with the `authorities' in the person of the police, many times corrupt as well. The dread of going to work, the dread of not going to work, the fear of being victimized and the glee of victimizing. The whole jumbled mix on people with few prospects and fewer dreams.  Algren has put it down in writing for all that care to read.  These are not pretty stories. And he has centered his story on the trials and tribulations of a dope addict trying to get clean, to boot. That fight is a near thing. Damn, as much as I knew about the kind of things that Algren was describing this is still one gripping story. And, the truth be told, you know as well as I do that unfortunately this story could still be written today. Read Algren if you want to walk on the wild side.

In the movie version of this film that unfortunately cannot capture the pathos of the mean urban streets Frank Sinatra plays the lead role of the Frankie Machine in a very understated way. He gives an extremely strong performance, especially in those scenes when he is going `cold turkey' to break his habit. Probably overrated as a singer Sinatra nevertheless was underrated as an actor, especially in his early career (think From Here to Eternity, Some Came Running and Suddenly). Kudos Frank. Kim Novak as his love interest and Eleanor Parker as his wife also stand out.",1212710400,,3003,4.5602968460111315
2023897,3,B0001PKFLS,"This B&W film begins in an urban area in the 1950s (""Hot Dogs 10 cents"") that seems like a Hollywood setting. Frankie gets off the bus and steps into a beer joint. ""The monkey is gone"", he has been in Lexington and kicked the habit. Frankie has big plans for his future. His wife welcomes him back. $50 a month goes a long way. Frankie must break with his past as a card dealer to keep straight. His wife Zosche wants more time with him. Frankie turns down his old job as a card dealer, but the police arrest him for wearing a $37 suit. The card game owner will bail him out if he returns to work (some double dealing here?). Frankie likes Molly but won't leave his wife. He has a chance to audition as a drummer for big band (but this form of entertainment was becoming obsolete). Frankie tells Molly about his past problem with drugs; he had to cheat at cards for money.

Louie arranged a big game with new players, but Frankie didn't show up for the game. Frankie is afraid to work as a card dealer in case he gets arrested again. Louie says ""$250 pays a lot of doctor bills"". Frankie joins Louie and they walk away. Molly knows what happened and makes a decision. Frankie deals cards at an illegal game. Thousands are wagered, the losers are angry at the dealer. Are they running a clean game? The players are addicted to their game while they are winning. Then something happens to end the game. What about that audition?

There is a dramatic confrontation that ends badly. The police question Zosche about it, but she says she was sleeping and heard nothing. Can Frankie quit ""cold turkey""? Will they show the torments of withdrawal symptoms? ""The newspapers can't twist your statements if you don't talk to them."" Then there is a miraculous recovery for someone, and a dramatic ending to this story that ties up the loose ends. The story of addictions overlays a romantic triangle and a murder mystery. It certainly tested the limits of the Hollywood Production Code.",1212192000,,1974,4.511173184357542
2023898,5,B0001PKFLS,"""The Man with the Golden Arm"" is probably Frank Sinatra's finest film. He plays Frankie Machine, a former heroin addict who was recently released from jail and is determined to stay clean. Frankie desperately wants to launch his musical career as a drummer, but his possessive, wheelchair-bound wife, Zosh (Eleanor Parker), smothers him and prevents him from making something of himself. Eventually Frankie encounters an old acquaintance, Schwiefka (Robert Strauss), who gets Frankie hooked on drugs again. After hitting rock bottom, Frankie finally turns to his old girlfriend, Molly (Kim Novak), for help getting clean.

This is a great movie with a lot of fantastic performances. Sinatra is amazing in his role, especially during the scenes where Frankie is going through withdrawal. Novak delivers a solid performance as the strong and compassionate Molly, and Parker is brilliant as Frankie's deranged wife. I should also mention the compelling jazz score by Elmer Bernstein, which enhances every moment of the story. There are a lot of interesting twists and turns in this film, and the ending is pretty shocking. Overall, ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" is an excellent film, and I think everyone will enjoy it.",1212019200,,1216,5.235897435897436
2023899,5,B0001PKFLS,"Before the advent of the French ""New Wave,"" director Otto Preminger directed the highly stylized, realistic urban classic ""The Man With the Golden Arm."" Frank Sinatra was never consistently great as an actor, but his portrayal of heroin addict Frankie Machine is not only the best of his career, but one of the best for anybody's career, for that matter. Set in 1955, this was a pretty risky movie for its time, and was to drug addiction what Billy Wilder's 1945 ""The Long Weekend"" was to alcoholism: A no-holds-barred, unwhitewashed slice of reality.
Frankie's problem is that he wants to return to normalcy after being released from prison, and then a halfway house. Like the novelist says, ""you write what you know,"" and likewise Frankie lives what he knows, and returns to his seedy Chicago neighborhood. From the moment of his uneventful return, normalcy -- his old life as a card dealer, his neurotic wife (Eleanor Parker) who feels too sorry for herself to help Frankie start clean with a new life, and a small-time heroin dealer, icily played by Darren McGavin -- tries to reel Frankie back into a dead-end routine and sink its hooks to keep him enslaved to his compulsions.

Frankie tries to embark on a new career as a jazz drummer, which provides the movie with the motifs for its streetwise ""crime jazz"" soundtrack, written by Elmer Bernstein. But, the cycle of addiction sets in lightning-quick because Frankie's wife wants him to bring home the money dealing cards again, which puts him smack dab in the company of the lowlifes he most desparately needs to avoid. Back at dealing, the local heroin dealer could not give a whit about Frankie staying clean; He's desparate to get Frankie to take that one fix and hook another regular customer.

Fortunately, Frankie finds salvation in the arms of Kim Novak, who was involved with Sinatra romantically at the time. Their relationship is a complex one, and Novak's empathy really comes through. Her hard-headed compassion in keeping Frankie away from a fix while he's sweating it out cold-turkey is riveting, because she's putting her own safety at risk. Even before modern theraputic terms like ""in denial"" were in vogue, we see Sinatra's character -- in the throes of his own addiction -- running down Novak's alcoholic boyfriend as a weakling who can't control his vices. It's beautifully handled, because the point is not to expose Frankie as a hypocrite, but to reveal his blindness to his own weaknesses. Frankie is a tragic hero of Shakesperian dimensions, but whose stage is set in a modern-day tenement.

Visually, this film is very striking, and is edited so that the montage is in rapid-fire sequence during crucial scenes. It's intercut in the same fashion as Saul Bass' pioneering title cutouts; Bass would go on to become Hollywood's most recognizable title designer, his sequences dominated by iconic graphics in movies such as Preminger's ""Anatomy of a Murder,"" ""Advise and Consent"" and Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" and ""Psycho.""

Of all Preminger's movies, this is the most cinematic. He would go on to use more laid-back camera setups and editing in movies like the one named above, and would break out into less intimate and more worldly settings with epics such as ""The Cardinal"" and ""In Harm's Way.""

""The Man With the Golden Arm"" catches Preminger at the top of his form as it does his cast. McGavin would never again be so intense, and only in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" for Sinatra and ""Vertigo"" for Novak would such powerful, commited and well-written performances again come their way.",1196467200,,3564,4.943238731218698

Set in 1955, this was a pretty risky movie for its time, and was to drug addiction what Billy Wilder's 1945 ""The Long Weekend"" was to alcoholism: A no-holds-barred, unwhitewashed slice of reality.
Frankie's problem is that he wants to return to normalcy after being released from prison, and then a halfway house. Like the novelist says, ""you write what you know,"" and likewise Frankie lives what he knows, and returns to his seedy Chicago neighborhood. From the moment of his uneventful return, normalcy -- his old life as a card dealer, his neurotic wife (Eleanor Parker) who feels too sorry for herself to help Frankie start clean with a new life, and a small-time heroin dealer, icily played by Darren McGavin -- tries to reel Frankie back into a dead-end routine and sink its hooks to keep him enslaved to his compulsions.

Frankie tries to embark on a new career as a jazz drummer, which provides the movie with the motifs for its streetwise ""crime jazz"" soundtrack, written by Elmer Bernstein. But, the cycle of addiction sets in lightning-quick because Frankie's wife wants him to bring home the money dealing cards again, which puts him smack dab in the company of the lowlifes he most desparately needs to avoid. Back at dealing, the local heroin dealer could not give a whit about Frankie staying clean; He's desparate to get Frankie to take that one fix and hook another regular customer.

Fortunately, Frankie finds salvation in the arms of Kim Novak, who was involved with Sinatra romantically at the time. Their relationship is a complex one, and Novak's empathy really comes through. Her hard-headed compassion in keeping Frankie away from a fix while he's sweating it out cold-turkey is riveting, because she's putting her own safety at risk. Even before modern theraputic terms like ""in denial"" were in vogue, we see Sinatra's character -- in the throes of his own addiction -- running down Novak's alcoholic boyfriend as a weakling who can't control his vices.

I recently saw Sinatra in the movie Suddenly, which was directed by Lewis Allen, and Sinatra wasn't nearly as good in Suddenly as he is here.  Sinatra in Suddenly was overplayed, and not very well played.  Here he is just fine, very believable, not the least bit overplayed, and he carries the movie on his shoulders.  I was surprised at how well Sinatra did in this role.

This isn't an easy film to watch.  There is a lot of agita in it.  People are making very bad choices with their lives.  Sinatra gets himself hooked on heroin, and his wife is intolerable, extremely negative and phony, very damaging to him.  You may as well know that before you buy the film.

Even with all the agita, I rate it four stars, and I suspect that is thanks to the director, Preminger.  We are watching a cast of lowlives at their worst.  But the story carries us along.

Who is the actor who plays Sinatra's sidekick, the one everyone calls Punk?  I think I've seen him on tv commercials saying ""What a chunk of chocolate!""  He is a very memorable character actor, but I have no idea what his name is.

This movie seems to be a tale with a moral - avoid heroin.  It reminds me of the John Lennon song on the same subject, the song called Cold Turkey.

Kim Novak tries to foster Sinatra's drumming dreams, in contrast to Parker who just wants to keep him under her thumb. The script is based on Nelson Algren's book of the same name, but the movie is quite different, mainly in character focus: in the book Machine is much more self-driven and Novak's character is less supportive.

2023918,4,B0001PKFLS,"Introspective Otto Preminger directs another b+w masterpiece of human psyche, this time revealing the inner conflicts of ex-convict, -heroin addict, and -card dealer Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra). After cleaning up his act (more ways than one) in the pen, Frankie returns to the cesspool of moral degradation that initially nurtured his vices. He quickly learns that few share his optimism for a new career as drummer -- a talent learned in rehab. Frankie's experience as a dealer, heroin addict, and drummer qualify him as THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM.

To rise above prophetic regression Frankie desperately needs strong support from someone. Top candidates are emotionally-addicted and wheelchair-bound wife Zosch (Eleanor Parker), sultry former chick-on-the-side Molly (Kim Novak), loyal but mentally deficient con-man Sparrow (Arnold Stang), drug pusher and two-bit gambler Louie (Darren McGaven), and former gambling boss Schwiefka (Robert Strauss). What a support group!

Sinatra's portrayal of Frankie is riveting. As an ex-junky, his decisions are sometimes predictable but you can't help hoping he will succeed. The store fronts in the opening scene are apparent facades -- made me think it would be a musical play -- but this is no musical and the sets become incidental as the plot unfolds.

There are many versions of THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM. The DVD from Passport Video is a good quality transfer but has a prominent ""PIP"" watermark in the lower right corner of the movie image which is slightly distracting.

2023919,5,B0001PKFLS,"To hear Frank Sinatra sing is to hear one of the most expressive voices of the last century.  But in Otto Preminger's THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM (1955), Sinatra gives a complete dramatic characterization as Frankie Machine, a ""recovered"" heroin addict and aspiring jazz drummer who is sadly sucked back into his old, destructive lifestyle after having been released from jail and ""rehab"" with high hopes for the future.  Sinatra, with his trademark combination of toughness and vulnerability, shows us a decent man whose surroundings - a brood of drug dependents and dealers, an emotionally weak and clinging wife - are his downfall.  It is only when those who would hold him back by keeping him a slave to the drug culture are destroyed that Frankie can go forth into the world and begin to fulfill his promise as a human being.

Because it points up human contradictions (Frankie's ""golden arm"" itself has three significances, two bad and one good) and involves themes of redemption and renewal, THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM is (as another reviewer suggested) Shakespearean in character; it is also Shakespearean in the sense that the viewer can often see tragedy coming before the characters themselves see it.  As a movie, it is a work of gritty realism typical of the 1950's; films like ON THE WATERFRONT, 12 ANGRY MEN, THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, and THE WRONG MAN also exemplify the genre.  The shining, minutely detailed black-and-white photography, the stark main title sequence (designed by Saul Bass, later to design titles for Hitchcock), and the blaring, pulsating jazz score (by Elmer Bernstein, who would write a similar score for THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS) are other factors that place THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM as a prime work of `50's cinematic realism.  And as a dramatization of substance abuse, it foreshadows a 1962 film about alcoholism, DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES with Jack Lemmon, which I would recommend to anyone moved by Sinatra and THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM.",1138579200,,1988,4.881305637982196

2023923,5,B0001PKFLS,"""The Man with the Golden Arm"" is Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra), just out of jail and back home in skid row.  Frankie was arrested for being a dealer in an illegal card game, but beat his heroin habit in jail and vows to get a good job and stay clean.  He returns to his clingy wife (Eleanor Parker), although he still carries a torch for his old girlfriend (Kim Novak).  Lack of money and hope soon send Frankie back to dealing for the neighborhood boss (Darren McGavin) and to his old drug habit.

This cautionary tale of the horrors of drug abuse was the first to deal with the subject of addiction and was considered rather shocking when it was released in 1955.  Compared to current films it is quite sanitized (the word ""heroin"" is never mentioned,  Frankie beats his addiction in just a few hours, the street scenes are filmed on a set).  But this is a terrific movie, thanks to the honest and touching performance of Frank Sinatra; he is simply wonderful in the role, which earned an Oscar nomination.  We see him clean and hopeful and suffering the agony of withdrawal.  The lovely Kim Novak is also memorable, giving her floozy character real depth with a heart and soul.  This is a must-see for Sinatra fans; he gives one of his best screen performances.

2023925,5,B0001PKFLS,"Viewing this film is like lifting a rock to see what has been existing under its dark weight, and from the stylish Saul Bass titles and jazzy Elmer Bernstein score, it is a riveting film, with a brilliant, intense Sinatra performance.

As an ex-con trying to beat a heroin addiction, ""Frankie"" (Sinatra) slips back into his old habits and friends upon release from prison, and is chained to a guilt-based relationship with Eleanor Parker, who is excellent as ""Zosch"", a woman who manipulates from her wheelchair, blaming ""Frankie"" for her fate, and resenting his friendship with ""Molly"", beautifully played by the gorgeous Kim Novak, who exudes vulnerability and a soft, sweet soul.

Well written from the Nelson Algren novel, and visually interesting with superb b&w cinematography by Sam Leavitt, the details of the costuming are also worth noting...I love Molly's old threadbare chenille bathrobe...and like much of the clothes in the film, looking like it was bought in a thrift shop.

I don't find this 1955 film dated at all; its themes and ""types"" are timeless and occur in every class and level of society, and the characters can be found in the Bowery or Beverly Hills.

The film was nominated in three Oscar categories: Best Actor (losing to Ernest Borgnine in another gritty film, ""Marty""), Best Art Direction/Set Decoration (""The Rose Tattoo""), and Best Score (losing to the romantic ""Love is a Many Splendored Thing"").

2023926,1,B0001PKFLS,"While other reviews are accurate in the assessment that this is a groundbreaking film for its time in its treatment of the illness of drug addiction, it is unfortunate that the director AND producer, Otto Preminger, lacked the courage to maintain the story in its original, poignant, compassionate - to ALL the characters - naturalist form.

The book is about the inability of humans to rise above their circumstances when everyone and everything around them, society, law enforcement, economics, conspire to keep them down.  It's about the individual need to hold on to what belongs to them, knowing that there's something better, but clinging to what is familiar and comfortable, however unhealthy and ultimately fatal.

It's about human courage in the face of constant, unrelenting defeat.

Preminger makes the story trite and two-dimensional.  The bad guys are bad, the good guys are good, there's compassion for the protagonists, but not the antagonist.  Algren was not so narrow in his perspective.  His subtlety of intention and complexity of characters - which could have been conveyed in a single close up -  is lost in Premingers depiction whose black and white celluloid unfortunately extends beyond the color of the footage.

This is certainly not Frank Sinatra's best performance, although a good one.  He could have been given so much more to work with, given some direction toward more depth and dimension.  If you want to see a great performance by Sinatra, get the ORIGINAL ""Manchurian Candidate.""  The only film I can think of which more poorly utilizes the ability of its performers was the 1999 production of ""Titus,"" with Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange.  Preminger's ability to coax sub-par performances from great actors with great material AND great music to work with was also evidenced in his ""Anatomy of a Murder.""

If you want a real look into an original, campassionate, controversial and honest look into the human condition, drug addiction, and economic and social oppression, read Algren's book.  The prose is beautiful, his treatment of the characters is gentle and compassionate with characters who received very little generosity or compassion in life.  And while you're at it, if you happen to be able to find a copy of Algren's own account of his dealings with Preminger, it'll make you think twice about Preminger's product, intention, and skewed vision of a true classic of literary naturalism.",1096156800,,2435,5.1421319796954315

2023929,4,B0001PKFLS,"...the most prominent aspects of the movie - Sinatra's unquestionably great performance, Preminger's use of compelling camera angles, the prominently placed Berstein Jazz score, and Novak's performance.  All of which are true and I agree that most of these combine to create a positive impression of this movie.
The best sequences in the movie involve Sinatra in the realm of men (and I mean Men as opposed to human) - when dealing the several day long card game while still trying to keep focused on the important audition Monday morning, the interchanges with the appealingly slimy heroin dealer (greasily played by Darrin McGavin in one of his best roles) while succumbing to the pull of the junkie, the failed musical audition, and the outstanding bit when he resolves to kick the habit cold-turkey. All of these were worth watching several times - thank God for chapter selections on DVD.
However, the movie is not perfect, and there are several things that can be readily cited as significant faults. The possessive and yet still possessed wife (Eleanor Parker) was a one-note performance: hysteria. Preminger needed to significantly pull back that character from the precipice that she fell off (long before she literally falls off). The first scene with her and Frankie upon his return home is the only one that was interesting and believable, all others were maudlin and overdone. She clearly had the acting chops to turn in a fascinating performance, as indicated by this first scene. Her character should have been one of the most pivotal in the movie, as she is the reason why Frankie returns and she inadvertently provides the key to his freedom when she gives herself up after killing the heroin dealer. As it is, scenes with her in it are mostly unwatchable.
The sycophantic toady friend of Frankie (Arnold Stang) was, I suppose, intended to be funny, but he is such an undeveloped stereotype as to be merely annoying. He greatly hindered my enjoyment of the movie.
Also the pacing at times really dragged at several points, most notably even during the great sequence with Sinatra kicking the habit. The rather long running time (119 minutes) could have been easily shortened by at least 20 minutes with some simple editing and tightening. Similarly, although the musical score was interesting and compelling - it tied in with Frankie's newly resolved ambition and nicely placed the movie among the heroin junkie jazz lifestyle of the time - it could have been much better utilized. One refrain in particular that recurs so often as to be annoying and at such a loud volume as to be distracting.  It is a perfect example of how great music can be diminished by misapplication.
That all being said, these detractions do not so significantly reduce the movie that I would not heartily recommend it to my friends. Dated and imperfect it may be, but it is still compelling and immensely watchable - and not just for Sinatra nuts like myself.",1020470400,,2953,4.904
2023930,5,B0001PKFLS,"Before the advent of the French ""New Wave,"" director Otto Preminger directed the highly stylized, realistic urban classic ""The Man With the Golden Arm.""  Frank Sinatra was never consistently great as an actor, but his portrayal of heroin addict Frankie Machine is not only the best of his career, but one of the best for anybody's career, for that matter.  Set in 1955, this was a pretty risky movie for its time, and was to drug addiction what Billy Wilder's 1945 ""The Long Weekend"" was to alcoholism:  A no-holds-barred, unwhitewashed slice of reality.
Frankie's problem is that he wants to return to normalcy after being released from prison, and then a halfway house.  Like the novelist says, ""you write what you know,"" and likewise Frankie lives what he knows, and returns to his seedy Chicago neighborhood.  From the moment of his uneventful return, normalcy -- his old life as a card dealer, his neurotic wife (Eleanor Parker) who feels too sorry for herself to help Frankie start clean with a new life, and a small-time heroin dealer, icily played by Darren McGavin -- tries to reel Frankie back into a dead-end routine and sink its hooks to keep him enslaved to his compulsions.
Frankie tries to embark on a new career as a jazz drummer, which provides the movie with the motifs for its streetwise ""crime jazz"" soundtrack, written by Elmer Bernstein.  But, the cycle of addiction sets in lightning-quick because Frankie's wife wants him to bring home the money dealing cards again, which puts him smack dab in the company of the lowlifes he most desparately needs to avoid.  Back at dealing, the local heroin dealer could not give a whit about Frankie staying clean;  He's desparate to get Frankie to take that one fix and hook another regular customer.
Fortunately, Frankie finds salvation in the arms of Kim Novak, who was involved with Sinatra romantically at the time.  Their relationship is a complex one, and Novak's empathy really comes through.  Her hard-headed compassion in keeping Frankie away from a fix while he's sweating it out cold-turkey is riveting, because she's putting her own safety at risk.  Even before modern theraputic terms like ""in denial"" were in vogue, we see Sinatra's character -- in the throes of his own addiction -- running down Novak's alcoholic boyfriend as a weakling who can't control his vices.  It's beautifully handled, because the point is not to expose Frankie as a hypocrite, but to reveal his blindness to his own weaknesses.  Frankie is a tragic hero of Shakesperian dimensions, but whose stage is set in a modern-day tenement.
Visually, this film is very striking, and is edited so that the montage is in rapid-fire sequence during crucial scenes.  It's intercut in the same fashion as Saul Bass' pioneering title cutouts; Bass would go on to become Hollywood's most recognizable title designer, his sequences dominated by iconic graphics in movies such as Preminger's ""Anatomy of a Murder,"" ""Advise and Consent"" and Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" and ""Psycho.""
Of all Preminger's movies, this is the most cinematic.  He would go on to use more laid-back camera setups and editing in movies like the one named above, and would break out into less intimate and more worldly settings with epics such as ""The Cardinal"" and ""In Harm's Way.""
""The Man With the Golden Arm"" catches Preminger at the top of his form as it does his cast.  McGavin would never again be so intense, and only in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" for Sinatra and ""Vertigo"" for Novak would such powerful, commited and well-written performances again come their way.",1019952000,,3575,4.943238731218698

Thus enslaved by the local card-games organiser, the local heroin dealer and his responsibility towards the girl, without forgetting the local police, he is unable to realise his dream to become a drummer in some big jazz band...Frank Sinatra is particularly convincing in his part and his going cold turkey is marvellously depicted.

Hollywood lore says that Sinatra visited a rehab clinic while preparing  for this film in order to see what a herion addict going through withdrawal  really looked (and acted) like. If true, it certainly must have given him  an insight into a world that its impossible for most people to understand.
Judged against Sinatra's other film performances, this certainly has to  rank as the best; the only other film roles that come close are Maggio in  ""From Here to Eternity"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"".  Its this performance, however, and the despiration of a man who wants to  take control of his life, but can't, that has to be at the top of the  list.

8016120,5,B0001PKFLS,"Review for The Man with the Golden Arm
Hot Toasty Rag, September 14. 2017

If you only see one Frank Sinatra movie in your lifetime, watch The Man with the Golden Arm. Not only was it the best performance of his acting career, but Frankie himself always felt he should have won his Oscar for this film, instead of From Here to Eternity. I wholeheartedly agree.

Frankie plays Frankie Machine, a former heroin addict and card dealer who returns to his hometown after a stint in jail. While hes been away, his wheelchair-bound wife, Eleanor Parker, has been taken care of by his drug dealer, Darren McGavin, who expects Frankie to show his gratitude now that hes returned. But Frankie wants a new life, a clean life. As he struggles to fight intense temptation, he learns how hard it is to stay sober.

Kim Novak is inarguably beautiful, and I love her in Picnic, so I don't want to dis her that much. Sufficed to say, her performance was the only lackluster one in the film. Darren McGavin, best known for his bumbling, laughable performance in A Christmas Story, plays a wonderful villain: slimy, motivated, and convincing as he pretends to care. Eleanor Parker is unrecognizable in her haggard, desperate role. I watched The Sound of Music for the hundredth time and asked my mom, Eleanor Parker was so pretty. Did she make any other movies? My mom said, She was in a movie you love: The Man with the Golden Arm! My response was, She was? What part did she play? That says everything.

Sometimes composers write themes within a film for specific characters, like in Ben-Hur or The Best Years of Our Lives. In Elmer Bernsteins fantastic score, Temptation itself is given a theme. Once youve heard the music to The Man with the Golden Arm, youll never forget it. Combined with Otto Premingers wonderfully rugged and classy directing style, whenever the music starts, youll get goosebumps as the scene of temptation plays out. The story is heart-breaking and incredibly real.

Nowadays, making movies about drugs isn't a novelty. Showing the use of heroin doesnt even shock audiences anymore. In 1955, during the reign of the Hays Code, a movie like this just wasn't made. In fact, it wasn't granted a seal of approval and wasn't allowed to be shown in some movie theaters during the release. Although theres no escaping the classic feel of Otto Premingers masterpiece, its just as gruesome and realistic as if it were made today. Drug use is shown, as well as the ungodly horrors of withdrawals. Every time I watch it, I still cant believe it was made in 1955so groundbreaking!

Ive said before that this was Frank Sinatras best performance, but in fact, its one of the best screen performances of all time. Watch it. Im sure youll agree.

Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to some drug use and adult content, I wouldnt let my kids watch it.",1505347200,,2886,4.714285714285714

He gave an incredible performance as the heroin addict Frankie Machine. I was not too pleased with Miss Parker's performance, I think it was a bit too much, she overacted and I found her as annoying as her character. But I thought that Miss Novak was just fine, she was an underrated actress who deserved much more. But it was Arnold Stang and especially, Darren McGavin, who gave me the creeps, that really caught my attention. I had never seen the entire film before, due to the unwatchable and inferior public domain releases, but I thought this version was just incredible. I won't soon forget Mr Sinatra going into DTs near the end of the film, trying to ""kick the monkey off of his back"". Another major plus is the memorable music score by Elmer Bernstein.
