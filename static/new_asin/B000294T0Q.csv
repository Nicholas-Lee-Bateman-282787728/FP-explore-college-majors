8024154,4,B000294T0Q,It has their highlights but not type of ballet video you will want to watch over and over... but surely is worth it... especially for its price =],1302393600,,146,4.25
8024155,5,B000294T0Q,I taped this program from my television set many years ago and then lost it later on.  I do have the DVD of the 1985 version of the Royal Ballet production of the Nutcracker with Leslie Collier as the Sugar Plum Fairy and Anthony Dowell as her Cavalier.  The pas de deux between the two of them is just absolutely gorgeous and totally awesome.  I also have Romeo and Juliet with Alessandra Ferri and she is just as phenomonal as Juliet as Margot Fonteyn was.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who would like a taste of the Royal Ballet and just how good they are.,1271116800,2,574,4.287037037037037
