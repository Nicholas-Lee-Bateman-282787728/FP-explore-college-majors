2942234,5,B000VIRD9C,I recieved this in great conditon and have seen it several time and enjoy it each time. I love getting mini series from the U.K. and without the commercials. That is why I would rather buy the dvd or vhs instead of watching it on t.v. Thank You.,1338768000,3,245,4.125
2942235,5,B000VIRD9C,This is my kind of movie.  I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.  Great acting & good story.  And even though it's 187 minutes it didn't seem long.,1324857600,4,154,3.75
2942236,5,B000VIRD9C,I loved the movie when it was on TV and was happy to hear it was available on dvd. It has great acting and love the special effects. I am a fan of disaster flicks and this one is at the top of my list!,1317600000,4,201,3.488888888888889
2942237,4,B000VIRD9C,"Much better than expected catastrophe film.  Very good acting, camera work, effects.  The ending could have been a little better but this is a very good film if you like this type of stuff.  Enjoy!",1313798400,7,197,4.571428571428571
2942238,3,B000VIRD9C,"I enjoy this one, with outstanding special effects, especially the flooding of London. But it stops there. I couldn""t remember what the story was about an hour after watching the disc.
I am still waiting for a disaster film that combines good special effects and a good story that remains in one""s mind after watching.",1273363200,2,318,4.8
2942239,2,B000VIRD9C,"A very disappointing interpretation of Richard Doyle's excellent book of the same title. They could have done so much more. I appreciate that making disaster films is difficult but huge chunks of the story are missing, chunks which would have given a much better forward to the story. This is one that I would not bother to watch again.

2942240,5,B000VIRD9C,"I felt the premise was credible, didn't find too many holes in the logic and they took their time telling the story (which accounts for the length). However, it never really was dull and there were some genuinely nail-biter moments.
Characterizations were excellent as were all the actors.
As disaster movies go..this one is definitely several cuts above.",1269561600,10,355,5.137931034482759
2942241,5,B000VIRD9C,"I think this product was amazing, it came in perfect condition, and I definitely recommend buying from this seller.  And the movie is just awesome as well.",1238803200,4,155,4.7407407407407405
2942242,3,B000VIRD9C,"Contrary to the description, this is not the first time it is released on DVD, it is the second, and more the better for it. This was an ITV telefilm (240 minutes) that was later edited for DVD (106 minutes) and has now been re-released at 188 minutes.

The original (very poorly) edited version received scathing reviews, and deservedly so. Most people watching didn't realise they were seeing something that had been hacked to bits. Now the full version is out and, although lengthy, it at least bridges some of the gaps in logic that were created by the hatchet job. That being said, this is not the best movie ever made but it does have its good points (effects, cast, and a decent plot). It was originally broadcast in two halves so that may be the best way to watch it.",1221523200,27,775,4.457746478873239
2942243,4,B000VIRD9C,"This was one of four movies released as T.V. Guide ""Made for TV disaster movies"". I was surprised to learn that this one was a mini series and British at that. I enjoyed the movie very much.",1427500800,,190,4.162162162162162

2942246,5,B000VIRD9C,I really would like to buy this but why is it so expensive ? Robert Carlyle is one of my favorite actors but $156 ?,1403395200,,115,3.64
2942247,5,B000VIRD9C,"This was a disaster movie I saw on TV years ago and I really liked it.  I enjoy good disaster movies and this was a good one. I was very happy to be able to find this one now. There were a few questions about the plot, but it was still better than a lot of others I have seen.",1398556800,,276,3.6
2942248,3,B000VIRD9C,Story line was very predictable and moved very slow. Would have liked to see what became of the people in the aftermath of the storm.,1392508800,,133,4.36

2942252,4,B000VIRD9C,"This DVD was hard to find! I saw the movie once on TV, 4 hours and lots of commercials!! Robert Carlyle is one of my favorite actors and he is brilliant in this movie. Of course, being from the U.S. the story was all new to me. But I'm so glad I found it.",1340755200,3,255,3.740740740740741

8218920,3,B000VIRD9C,"Though a good film, this was not the American version. Let me explain. This film shows almost half the same scenes in the longer version shown in this country. The one I bought from England though okay, if you had watched the original TV two night release you notice parts that are missing that tell a better story and fill in the blanks. Though very cheap to buy I wish I spent more on the movie that had been released in America.",1496361600,,431,4.2682926829268295
8218921,5,B000VIRD9C,I am watching this now! Really good. Only problem--the music is SO loud. Have to keep my finger on the volume button. Stargate Universe madee a Robert Carlyle fan. I absolutely love disaster movies.,1482537600,,198,4.852941176470588

8218927,5,B000VIRD9C,"I love disaster films. This is one of the great ones. I first saw it on TV a few years ago and it wasn't as good as renting the video this time and now I know why. The TV version wasn't the full length version.  The actors in this film are great. The character development is fantastic, as are the special effects. The scary thing about this is that it is a credible story that could really happen. David Suchet does a fabulous job portraying the Deputy Prime Minister while Joanne Whaley does an equally great job as the Police Commissioner as they both have to take charge and deal with the disaster facing their city, their country and their homes.
Overall, if you're into disaster films, I highly recommend this to everyone. You won't be disappointed. Yes, it is a long one, but it never gets dull.",1437868800,2,802,4.418918918918919
