8385594,5,B0030BF7FY,"This episode has changed my life. I was so captivated by watching Lidia taste the quince and hazelnut chutney that I added a quince tree and seckels pear to our orchard, just so I can make the fruit-and-hazelnut specialty called ""cunja."" After waiting a year for the quince tree to provide fruit, we savored every bite of the intense flavors of cunja. The combination of fruit and nuts is fascinating on its own, by the spoonful, or with a nice Greek yogurt -- as well as Lidia's other serving suggestions.

We have happily added this recipe and cooking tradition to our lives, and will make cunja every autumn when our quince are fragrant and ripe. Now I look forward to tasting the scrumtious looking hazelnut cake. Watching Lidia adds an additional enticement and dimension to the recipes found in her book, as well as cooking techniques. You'll definitely want Lidia's cookbook, in order to prepare the recipes seen on her shows.",1292889600,,933,4.795031055900621
