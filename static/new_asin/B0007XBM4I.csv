8053218,5,B0007XBM4I,"This workout offers exactly what it promises a pain-free posture and back thanks to a pain-free posture and workout. After doing the workout, I could feel the workout most in my abs--which are key to maintaining a good posture and a healthy back--and after only one session the chronic pain in my back, particularly lower back and glutes was minimized.",1302566400,9,352,4.883333333333334
8053219,5,B0007XBM4I,I've done pilates for years.  The explanation and directions given during the DVD are correct and helpful in remembering to perform correct movements.  The Stott DVD's are wonderful.  I love them.,1287792000,5,196,5.258064516129032
8053220,4,B0007XBM4I,"This is a fairly short set of exercises and is only appropriate for those with back problems.  It is clearly low-impact and is good for those with poor back mobility.  It is of a rehabilitative nature and would be very un-challenging for a person who does not have back problems.  It is a nice set of pilates for those of us whose backs don't allow us to really do ""normal"" pilates.",1153008000,21,382,4.352112676056338
8053221,4,B0007XBM4I,"This Pilates workout is intended for those who need an extra-gentle Pilates session to strengthen abs and rehab the back. I found it to be an excellent, gentle and safe introduction to Pilates. (Always check with a practitioner first though). I also recommend Allan Menezes Pilates for back pain.",1130630400,21,296,5.061224489795919
8053222,3,B0007XBM4I,Work by Stott appears to be repetitive in many of their CDs.  Looks like the same material with different CD titles.,1127174400,12,116,4.523809523809524
