No, it's my face"" when they were arguing about who was being used.  To me, not knowing a lot about art, the portrait in the museum certainly did capture Amanda's soul, the sadness in her eyes which reflected her shame at her social position.  From the way she reacted in the museum, it seemed that she realized the painting had captured her soul.  So why did she make that comment later on in the Hollywood Bowl?  What did I miss?  Still, both scenes were nice.",1503273600,,595,4.609523809523809

262766,4,6300218031,"I've always liked this movie. I think it gets buried because too many people keep comparing it to other JH films like Pretty in Pink, and while it may have similarities (it is coming from the same mind after all) and not be as popular as perhaps The Breakfast Club, it needs to be viewed as an individual. Like other JH films, I think a lot of people (especially teens) can relate to the characters in some way or another such as feeling inferior or like an outcast, trying to maintain a desired status, secret crushes, etc. It's just a good and simple flick, so there is no need for it to be over analyzed or obsessively compared to every other JH film, especially when none of them are really deep after all. Yeah it wasn't as popular, does it really matter? It's still a perfectly good and watchable movie.

I have the 2002 DVD release and it is occasionally grainy/washed out in places. I'm not sure if the newer release is any better or not, but I'm glad to have a non-VHS copy and enjoy this movie.",1493164800,,1004,4.340425531914893
262767,5,6300218031,As good and appealing as Lea Thompson is(the director married her) the heart and soul of this film is Mary Stuart Masterson.

263079,4,6300218031,"SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL is typical of the teen movies of the 1980s like Ferris Bueller's Day Off and The Breakfast Club, an effective blend of raw emotion and familiar character types. The familiar-seeming love triangle forces all of the protagonists to re-think what they want from each other and the world and the best ways of reaching these goals. In the end, each has to demonstrate courage and understanding to get what is best for all of them.

Teenagers might find the movie a little silly and outdated in some ways (the clothes and music are very '80s) but the dialogue is very real and funny, and the cast turns in excellent performances, especially Eric Stoltz and Mary Stuart Masterson. Parents will have a chance to relive their high school days and hopefully start some conversations about challenges and triumphs of their own.",1471824000,6,839,4.826388888888889
263080,3,6300218031,"Well I'm only giving it a three because I was in high school when this came out and my experience as a teenager during the eighties was dramatically different than how John Hughes portrays it. In my opinion, John Hughes movies were far too stylized and pretty subjective with a California-ish white upper middle class orientation. However, I am a fan of Stoltz and Lea Thompson and they're always cool to see. Not a big fan of Masterson though. It's of course funny to watch this now after 30 years. Wow! I always come away from these movies feeling as if I should have dressed differently and made more money. Ha Ha",1469836800,,616,4.508928571428571

263082,2,6300218031,"Last of the John Hughes teen movies, and it's pretty clear that he'd already said everything he had to say. Thematically similar to Pretty in Pink, Hughes's preceding collaboration with director Howard Deutch, Wonderful isn't half as charming in either script or performance. It's a wishy-washy, often boring take on the same old ""us versus them"" concept, wrapped up in the hopeless chase of the school beauty. Age has been a stretch for these films before (Judd Nelson and Emilio Estevez were in their mid-20's for The Breakfast Club) but the acting has always been good enough to make us forget. This time, without any of the Brat Pack regulars, there's something missing; it constantly feels like adult stars forced into adolescent roles. Lea Thompson seems like she's on her way to interview for a news broadcasting gig, and approximately 75% of the school wears shoulder pads of one variety or another. None of it feels authentic. The performances are almost universally hollow and vacant, too, especially from leading man Eric Stolz, who looks and acts like a mannequin. It has a few redeeming moments, particularly a shining small part for Elias Koteas as a punk rock musclehead, and a good message, but otherwise it's passionless fodder. I guess all good things must come to an end.",1468800000,,1290,4.949308755760368

Those dimples! Never been a big Eric Stoltz fan and I think that's why I don't like this movie as much as most people do. It's not bad, just predictable. And I suppose I can't help feeling like a parent when Stoltz's character spends his college money on earrings. I'm sorry, that's not romantic, that's just plain stupid. This kid is going nowhere in life. Masterson's character will go off to college and he'll still be playing the grease monkey.",1461974400,5,616,4.508928571428571

Craig Sheffer gives Spader a run for his money as one of the douchiest rich pricks in the genre, and Leah Thompson plays the misunderstood, insecure hot chick from the wrong side of the tracks with heart.

But his best friend, which is a girl (Mary Stuart Masterson) is really more than a friend gets very jelous and just cant tell him how she feels.

263723,5,6300218031,"THE FORGOTTEN JOHN HUGHES FILM

Everyone forgets about Some Kind of Wonderful when discussing John Hughes classics. But this one was definitely among his best.

Despite the minor detail that Eric Stoltz can't act (unless the part is a character who is supposed to have an emotionless blank stare) this ends up being a wonderfully sweet movie. It's a typical 1980's teenage love story, which is the same as repeating that it's a John Hughes film.

It's a good story. It's entertaining.

You'll spend the whole movie thinking Eric Stoltz's character is a moron because...he is. And you'll feel Mary Stewart Masterson's pain and anguish all along. But again...it's a typical John Hughes film.

It's fantastic. There is no reason not to watch this. It holds up in the modern era. (The fashions don't. But the story does.)",1440115200,12,817,4.891304347826087

263764,5,6300218031,"The 1980s were a sort of Golden Age much like the 1950s.  Indeed, in some ways, the styles were alike-especially with the flat-top haircut.  This movie is an excellent teenage coming of age film about the social interactions in an upper class/middle class high school.  The story itself is somewhat predictable.  Boy (Keith-played by Eric Stoltz) has a crush on Girl (Amanda-played by Lea Thompson)-a classy but less wealthy in-crowd chick.  Keith's best friend is a tom-boy (Watts-played by Mary Stuart Masterson) who is blossoming into becoming a woman with the needs of women.

The movie's plot thus orbits around a highly anticipated date between Keith and Amanda with Watts volunteering as chauffeur.  Meanwhile, the stuck up rich kid (Hardy-played by Craig Sheffer) and rival to Keith has invited Keith to a party where Hardy plans to beat up and socially humiliate Keith.

Keith must face his rival, win the girl-or perhaps win the right girl and make the right choices as to what he plans to do following high school.  Unlike so much of Hollywood's cultural poison which glorifies self-destruction and family breakup, this movie gets the family to be civil to each other even with disagreements.  Keith's connection to the ""bad boys"" in detention is also well done and reminded me-and of course many others-of their own high schools.  Indeed the ""bad kids"" normally are the ones that make the most loyal of friendships.  It's the leather jacket wearing skinhead with the heart of gold trope that seems to accurately reflect the real world.

I really enjoyed this movie and the styles and technology contemporaneous to the time of the movie (1987) filled me with an enjoyable nostalgia.  Don't see this as a silly teen movie.  The characters grow in this film and the audience-especially the young get a pretty solid message from the film.

It's also nice to look back at the 1980s-when peace and prosperity was the norm.",1439769600,,1928,4.940993788819876

This is way shallow but was Eric Stoltz seriously hot or what in this?! I had no idea. Anyways I really enjoyed the premise and the fact that it evoked feelings in me that I hadnt had in a long time-precisely what it felt like to be a teenager again and all the emotional highs and lows that go along with it. Im kind of nostalgic for those feelings yet happy that Im not a slave to them anymore. Regardless job well done with this movie and Ill probably watch it again at some point.,1427846400,,601,4.375

I just don't know
I watched this movie every day for maybe 2 years.  I guess it made me feel good that a guy from the poor side can get a rich girl but really what he wants is in front of him.

In high school I devoted a lot of time to art, didn't fit into the social scene, and had a wide variety of friends but certainly wasn't in with the in crowd.  The script is a terrific romantic comedy.  Keith, the main character, pulling all his college money out of the bank to buy some diamond ear rings for the hot looking girl he doesn't really know but is strongly attracted to on his one and only big date night doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but sounds like high school logic.  Whatever... the absorbing story is loaded with a wide variety of interesting characters, all of whom interested me, and I could relate to the high school angst many of these people were going through.

264456,5,6300218031,"Out of all the John Hughes pictures I've seen, SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL ranks first in my heart, with FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF and THE BREAKFAST CLUB slugging it out for a second place finish. And, yeah, it wasn't John Hughes who directed this one (but rather Howard Deutch), but SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL is full of those quintessential John Hughes touches. And, besides, Hughes wrote the thing. This movie is when I fell in love with Mary Stuart Masterson, and, to me, clearly, her character Watts, sardonic and disaffected and yet secretly in love, is the most vital role in the film.

John Hughes knows how painful high school can be, knows how big a deal it is for teens. He has this knack for tapping into the heart of the teenaged struggle. When we were kids, our world revolved around this quest for self-identity and a place in the pecking order and there was always, always this pressure to fit in. There's a reason Hughes' films in the '80s have stood the test of time. He makes it so personal and approaches it with great sensitivity and wit and real emotion. He makes you invest.

Back in high school, you and I, we can relate to what Keith Nelson is going thru. Shy and closed-in and a bit of an outcast, Keith (Eric Stoltz) has fallen hopelessly for the most popular girl in school, Amanda Brown (Lea Thompson). Amanda lives in the same blue collar neighborhood as Keith and his best friend Watts. Except that Amanda happens to date the rich big man on campus and hangs with the posh, trendy crowd. Or as Watts, a devastatingly cute tomboy, remarks: ""Guilt by association."" Amanda is clearly out of Keith's league. But Keith is one of those brave souls who opts to lay his heart on the line. Did I say brave? Maybe I meant stupid. Even Watts is trying to drive sense into Keith. Of course, she's got ulterior motives.

Keith girds his loins or screws his courage to the sticking place or whatever, and he puts himself out there. Surprisingly, his overtures toward Amanda are met with success and she agrees to a date. Mostly because Amanda's boyfriend has been acting like a champion tool (and Craig Sheffer is so good as the bad guy here). The film messes with the viewer. It initially establishes Watts as the rooting interest. She's the one pining for her best friend. But then the film turns around and makes Amanda Brown a sympathetic character also worth rooting for. I think that this is one of Lea Thompson's best roles. She makes Amanda Brown a three-dimensional person who gets hurt the same as anyone, and not 'til the very end do you really know with whom Keith will end up.

It's one of those perfect casts, really. I think everyone is strong in their parts, from John Aston's demanding working class father who doesn't quite get his introspective son to Elias Koteas' howlingly funny rebel punk who befriends Keith and, in an odd way, plays a sort of fairy godmother role. But, really, SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL belongs to Mary Stuart Masterson. She's the heart of it all. Equal parts defiant and vulnerable, she breaks your heart many times in this film. And how can you not fall for Watts, a wounded girl who not only is a bit of an iconoclast but who also plays the drums? How can you not pull for her? And yet, on the other hand, there stands Amanda Brown, equally wounded and who stands up for herself and is equally deserving of that good ending. SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL is a legitimate romantic triangle and one of the best teen movies I've ever seen. Teen angst and social conflict and another superb 1980s soundtrack. Characters that feel real and emotional arcs that draw you in. This was when John Hughes still had that magic touch.

I know, I know, propaganda alert, but I did enjoy everything about it purely as a story with no subversive Catholic crap approved of. Mary Stuart Masterson is the beautiful, tough girl outcast, Watts, who is secretly in love with her mechanic best friend, Keith - who is of course, is drooling for the popular, conventionally pretty girl in school. Who in turn, ignores him completely and dates the snotty rich guy in her clique, who treats her like crap. It's a love triangle. Watts plays the drums and hangs out with Keith at the shop but is too much of a tough girl - and a virgin - to make her feelings known to him. All he can obsess about is Amanda Jones the girl of his dreams. He draws her. He spends his college fund on the perfect date to woo her. There's all kinds of drama with her boyfriend deciding to set up Keith for a beating. Watts is loyal and agrees to help him out. She hates Amanda clearly, but is worried about the beating thing. I won't tell you about the rest of the plot or movie, but it's a great trip. I was always rooting for Watts, though Amanda seems less of a b*tch once you get to know her. I was kind of in love with Watts when I first saw this movie, she's the kind of people I like. I like Keith too, they're sort of underground (maybe hero) types, outcasts, arty and tough. Working class, maybe trailer trash for Watts or something. I felt sort of at home. It's a good vibe. Romantic....",1296950400,,1574,4.25

264480,4,6300218031,"John Hughes was behind some of the most revered teen movies of the 1980s and beyond. Several of his films (i.e. The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off) have achieved pop culture immortality, so it's a bit surprising that one of his best contributions to the genre remains relatively unknown. He supposedly made Some Kind of Wonderful because he was unsatisfied with the ending to his previous film with director Howard Deutch, Pretty in Pink. The similarities between the two movies are numerous and occasionally glaring, but this time the characters are more tangible and their situations are less contrived. Some Kind of Wonderful centers on Keith Nelson (Eric Stoltz), an artsy misfit from a blue-collar family who pines for Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson), the most popular girl in school. Like Keith, Amanda is from the ""wrong side of the tracks,"" but she uses her good looks to elevate her status. Keith's best friend Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson) is an angsty social outcast.  She's falling hard for Keith, but he remains frustratingly oblivious. The plot may sound like a typical high school soap opera, but this is a story of redemption. The sheer amount of hard work, humor, and sensitivity contributed by the cast and crew elevates this film above the clich.  The lead actors, particularly Masterson, offer pitch-perfect performances. Sidekicks like Duncan the Skinhead (Elias Koteas) and Keith's younger sisters (played by Maddie Corman and a pre-Full House Candace Cameron) deliver hilarious one-liners. Combine all of that with one of the best soundtracks of the 80s, and you have the recipe for a Hughes classic. 4 Stars.",1264550400,2,1638,5.108208955223881
264481,5,6300218031,"Another reviewer did an awesome comparison to ""Pretty in Pink"" and they were right on the money.  A great side-by-side compare and contrast.  I had never thought of ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" this way.

When this movie came out, I think I saw it in the movie theater 3-4 times before I actually owned it on VHS and more recently DVD.  It is one of my favorite movies of all time because I always identified with Watts' character (and was told by friends in the 80's about the reminder).  If you are a lover of the 80's John Hughes genre of films you will love this one.  The characters are played out well and the storyline is very sweet.  You can really feel the teenage angst between Mary Stuart Masterson ""Watts"" and Eric Stolz ""Keith"" as a best-friendship works towards something more.  Many of the actors and actresses in ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" have gone on to bigger careers and also recur in other John Hughes films.

After 20+ years, this still remains one of my favorite movies.  A must for every John Hughes groupie.",1262476800,3,1026,4.4972972972972975
264502,5,6300218031,"John Hughes proves he still had the right stuff to make a superb movie about teenagers with 1987's ""Some Kind of Wonderful"".  Eric Stolz stars as Keith, a sensitive artistic kid from the wrong side of the tracks, who works after school as an auto mechanic and who has a monumental crush on pretty and popular classmate Amanda (Lea Thompson).  Mary Stuart Masterson is pitch perfect as tough tom boy Watts, Keith's best friend.

Keith decides to ask Amanda out, a daring act which cuts against the grain of his social standing, the advice of the horrified Watts, and the warning of Amanda's angry former boyfriend Hardy (Craig Sheffer).  The rest of the movie is the gutsy Keith's preparation for his date with destiny (and Amanda).  Watts helps out, if only to save the dreamy Keith from himself.  Keith will also get an unexpected assist from a tough kid he befriends in detention.

Hughes and Director Howard Deutch have the sensitive touch to portray three-dimensional young people with real hopes and fears, without drowning the audience in schmaltz.  The conclusion of the movie manages to be dramatic, insightful,and romantic all at the same time.  ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" is still all that, and very highly recommended to fans of John Hughes' other movies, such as ""The Breakfast Club"".",1258934400,3,1294,4.89908256880734

264508,4,6300218031,"And my 80's reviews continue. Okay, watching this movie is basically like watching ""Pretty In Pink"" all over again, but with the genders and ending switched. Makes sense. It was written by the same writer, John Hughes, and directed by the same director, Howard Deutch(who would later marry his star, Lea Thompson). But there's more to it than that, and we will get into that a little bit later. For starters, let's get to what the movie is about. But if you have seen the already mentioned PIP, then you pretty much already know. And having just written a review for PIP, I thought it would be quite hard to review a movie that is basically the same one I just wrote about. But I will do my best!.

Eric Stoltz stars as Keith Nelson, a middle class 18 year old high school senior. He works at a garage, attends school, and has a father(John Ashton, ""Beverly Hills Cop"")riding his every moment to pick a college to attend. But Keith is on his own path. He has a best friend in Watts(Mary Stuart Masterson), a tomboy with a love of drums(as she carries her sticks with her wherever she goes)and for Keith. But you see, Keith is blind, and he doesn't see it. Instead, he has the hots for Amanda Jones(Lea Thompson), a beauty who is in a whole other class than Keith and seemingly unattainable. When she has had enough of her boyfriend Hardy Jenns(Craig Scheffer), Amanda accepts Keith's offer of a date, and he sets out to win the girl, stand up to the bully, and continue to overlook his best pal's feelings for him.

Okay, here is how I know the story. John Hughes wrote ""Pretty In Pink"" with an ending he liked and wanted. The director, producers, and even Ringwald(who was offered this movie but turned it down. Why would she want to do the same movie over again?) herself, didn't like it, didn't think the audience would either, and it was changed. In my opinion, it was a change for the better. Ending it the other way just didn't ring true to me and a lot of others, and the people involved supporting the change have valid reasoning. So, John Hughes ended up writing this movie in response to how ""Pretty In Pink"" ended with his original ending intact. Except this time, his original ending works for the better with these characters. It really wouldn't of worked with PIP at all, and I am glad they changed it for that film. Here, it does ring true, and it works. It feels right. The way it should be. But does anything else work?.

Just like PIP, ""Some King Of Wondeful"" is working with a story that is not new and we've seen numerous times. But the movie has what PIP had that made it seem worthwhile. The script, and a lot of the dialogue, just works for the time and place and the characters. These people seem like real human beings, and not plastic models that you see plastered all over TV and movies nowadays. I found myself charmed by the whole thing, as with PIP, and really liked the characters. Speaking of, The characters were cast with good actors. Even though Ringwald sat this one out, we get another redhead in the form of Eric Stoltz. He does an admirable job as Keith Nelson, and he is really likeable and down to earth. There is an innocent charm to him in the same way as Ringwald's past characters in the Hughes universe. He is relatable and watchable. So too is Mary Stuart Masterson as Watts, the ""Duckie"" of this version. She has the right kind of attitude and punkiness for the role, and doesn't make it a caricature, which can so easily be done, and many actors would do just that with the role. Sadly, Lea Thompson(the female version of Andrew McCarthy) can't quite match the other two. She is pretty and likeable, but I got the feeling that maybe she was just the wrong choice for Amanda Jones. Some of her scenes were a little wooden, and I didn't get much chemistry with her and Keith together. Thompson is a fine actress, but she has been much better in other roles. And then there is Keith's family. John Ashton is great as the gruff dad, but it's Keith's two sisters, played by Maddie Corman and Candace Cameron, that steal the show. Some of the best humor in the movie comes from his family. I loved those parts. I also loved Elias Koteas as the school tough guy, whose relationship with Keith soon turns after his first introduction in the movie in a great way. His scenes with Stoltz in detention admiring each other's art work was a particular highlight. I also loved the ""Breakfast Club"" reference when Watts tells the guys she's playing cards with ""you mess with the bull, you get the horns"". The line the principal gave to Bender.

I really liked and enjoyed this movie a lot, and even though there is a part of me that wants to write a less than rave review, or at least, a smaller four star rating, simply because we've just seen this movie a year before, I just can't. I liked it too much and it was just very enjoyable. No matter if we've seen this story before, this movie still manages to get you with it's real, normal, characters, the well casted actors they have assembled for the movie, and the surroundings. No matter what decade, we've all been to high school. John Hughes always knows how to cast a movie too. His casts are usually great. As for the ending, it's the feel good ending that a lot of people would want, and here, it's what should happen. I just don't think I would feel the same if PIP had ended the same way. Plus, if it did, then we probably wouldn't of gotten this movie. And did you catch a Rolling Stones theme throughout the movie. Amanda Jones is a Stones song, one that is heard throughout the film. The main kid, Keith, is named after Keith Richards. And Watts?. You guessed it. Stones drummer, Charlie Watts. Love it. So, ""Some Kind Of Wonderful"" is PIP 2, but that's okay. It's also one of, if not the last, great teen/high school movies of the 80's, and John Hughes' last as well. The 80's was just perfect, and it surprises me how people still have to point out, as a negative, that these movies are dated. Well, of course they are. And the point being?. They weren't made yesterday. Nowadays, something only a month old is dated and people are on to the next thing. The great thing about these movies is that not only is it's ""dated-ness"" a good thing, a fun nostalgic thing, but these movies have things that people can see and go ""Oh!, remember that!"". Some of these things may not be what someone wants to remember, but they are memorable. 20 years from now, it's not going to be the same looking back at movies from the 90's or present day. I guess it means more to those who actually grew up in the time and understand what it had to offer much better. Also, these kinds of movies have issues that are universal to everyone. Hughes was a master at this genre. Nobody did it better than him. If ""Some Kind Of Wonderful"" was to be his teen swan song, it wasn't a bad way to go.

This edition is the ""I Love The 80's"" version, and there are no special features, but you get the exact same CD with the exact same 4 songs that are in the other editions. While this is cool, it would of been nice if it were a different CD in each one. I mean, does anyone really need numerous copies of A-Ha's ""Take On Me""?.

Some Kind of Wonderful is comparable to Pretty In Pink, and is an extremely good movie that teenagers, no matter what decade they were born in, whether it be the 60s or the 90s, can relate to.",1217548800,9,649,3.9618320610687023

My fave scene in this movie has to be when the tough guys show up to help and the party, and how some of the rich girls liked them. It ended the way I wish it would, although I wonder if the money on those diamonds could have been put to better use, his girl would have loved him anyways.

I was in my early teens when this movie was released back in 1987. I remember enjoying the movie and every time I see the 3 lead actors in other productions I think back and remember that he or she were in ""Some Kind of Wonderful""
At first I could not remember much about the movie as I had not seen it for over 19 years.
Last night I sat down to view the 80's teen film. I can not tell you how wonderful this movie is. The story line is Typical and Predictable. However as other reviews have mention it is the lead actors that pull of this production.
Watching this gem of a movie took me back to my teen years and remembering why I first feel in love with this production.
This is far the best of John Hughes movies of the 80's. Outstanding even Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club.
If you can only have one of John Hughes movies from the 80's, Some Kind of Wonderful would be it.
With a wonderful cast and soundtrack at a great price you can not go wrong.

The best scene is when Keith (Eric Stolz), turns up at the party that Arty is having, and stands up to him in front of all his friends.

264601,5,6300218031,"I am a huge fan of the legendary Hughes films of the Eighties.  This is the sleeper of the bunch.  A true hidden jem not just of the Hughes films, but all of those teenage films that dominated 80's theater.  This is the last true masterpiece that he created.  He followed his string of teenage targeted sucesses with Uncle Buck & Home Alone.  He never returned back to his roots.  This is the ultimate love story of all his films & a glorious grand finale.

I wrote my first review of Some Kind of Wonderful on Feb. 15th, 2007.  I recently had to do a report for school about teen films so I chose one of my favorites... this one.  I am posting an abridged version of my report; a better review I hope.

The 80's were the greatest for teen movies in general.  John Hughes' was by far the man known to define 1980's outstanding cinema with a list of the most known teen films of that decade.  Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, Weird Science, Pretty in Pink, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off all have to be mentioned if anyone is discussing teen movies in general.  These were all hits and are still popular amongst diehard fans of that era in film.  John Hughes would go on to write, produce, and / or direct Uncle Buck, the hit Home Alone & the odd, but funny Planes, Trains, & Automobiles.  He had a way of understanding teen issues of the day and was able to express them in his writing and in his directing.

1987's Some Kind of Wonderful is an interesting teen love triangle in the vein of another Hughes film, Pretty in Pink.  This film has a fantastic cast and practically a perfectly written script.  Numerous characters are well thought out and developed within the film; not just thrown together to be shown once only to be forgotten ten minutes later... well maybe with the exception of the Mom character.  It is very easy to be drawn into this world of 80's teenage angst.  The sensationally edgy soundtrack helps to achieve this by bringing more emotion from the fabulous performances of the excellent ensemble.

Some Kind of Wonderful opens up with the character Watts rapidly playing on some drums.  The rhythm drives the initial and traditional 80's montage that introduces all of the main players.  The beautiful Watts is played by the fresh faced Mary Stewart Masterson.  Her bobbed blonde hair is very reminiscent of Human League's Susan Ann Sulley.  Mary truly steals the film with an absolutely amazing performance as the heart torn best friend.  Watts is a tomboy from the wrong side of town and best friend to the main character in the film Keith.  The curious and hard working Keith Nelson is played by Eric Stoltz.  Keith is a loner artist from a blue collar family from the same neighborhood as Watts.  The gorgeous Amanda Jones is next introduced in the arms of her rich and popular boyfriend.  Amanda is played by the wonderful actress Lea Thompson.  Hardy Jenns, Amanda's snobbish and obnoxious boyfriend is played by Craig Sheffer.  Some may recognize him as the quarterback alongside James Caan in the awesome 1990's college football film, The Program. These four consist of the main force that drives this film.

Keith works after school as an auto mechanic and gas station attendant saving money for his unknown future. When he is not working he spends his time either painting and illustrating or hanging out with his pal Watts.  Keith is an admirer of the popular and totally taken Amanda Jones.  His interest increases and he totally falls for her.  A glimmer of hope begins to shine for Keith when Amanda and her A hole of a boyfriend's relationship starts to crumble.  Keith consults his good friend Watts for advice in his quest for love.  She does not respond in kind and repeatedly explains to him that there is no chance for him to ever go out with Amanda who hangs out with the rich kids.  Hardy, Amanda's boyfriend realizes Keith's interest in his girlfriend and tensions start to build between them.  Tension increases between the frustrated good friend Watts and the clueless Keith as he continues to plan to win the heart of Amanda...

If you want to know how this all ends you will have to see the movie.  No sense in ruining it for you.

There has to be a definite mention of the high school bully Skinhead named Duncan.  He is awesomely played by Elias Koteas; a little reminiscent of a young De Niro at times.  There are a couple of scenes with a young Candace Cameron playing Keith's youngest sister; one where she is shuffling through some awesome Garbage Pail Kids cards.  Candace played the oldest sister on the show Full House.

Interestingly there is a sneaky Rolling Stones theme throughout this film. The main character, Keith, is named after Keith Richards the legendary guitarist. Keith's best friend Watts who is an obsessed percussionist is named after the drummer from the Rolling Stones, Charlie Watts.  Last, but not least Amanda Jones is a Rolling Stones song and is used twice in the movie.  On another music note Chyna Phillips plays the other love interest of Amanda's boyfriend Hardy.  Chyna was part of the 90's band Wilson / Phillips and the daughter of Mamma & the Pappa's John and Michelle Phillips.

Some Kind of Wonderful is a one of a kind; truly a great movie.  It did not reach the same status as Hughes' other classics.  Sadly this film was advertised poorly and many thought it was just a rehash of Pretty in Pink.  Regardless this was the last true teen masterpiece that Hughes made in the 80's.  Now there are a dime a dozen American Pie type clones thrown together that cannot tell a story as fraction as well as John Hughes could.  Sadly he is no longer around and passed away a few years back.  Luckily he left us with a great bunch of films that give us all a glimpse into the life of a teen and a view of the 80's.",1171497600,5,5797,4.568380213385063

264604,3,6300218031,"I do not  know what is is about this movie...it casts some type of strange hypnotic spell over me!

The plot is a recycle of numerous other ""get the girl even know she's to good for you"" yet I find the story invigorating. Its just about a every day, un popular kid (Eric Stolz) from a family of humble finances who gets the courage to ask the most popular and cutest girl out on a date. He wants to impress her to show that he is good enough for her.

The characters are all wooden stereotypes with no development yet I root and hiss at them

The soundtrack is soooooo 1980's yet the songs make me move and gyrate, especially the new wave-ish ""Falling in Love""

The ending is anti-climatic yet there is a certain charm to the ""what the heck"" attitude about the movie...like it does not need any type of climax.

One of the reasons this movie works is b/c of the actors. Eric Stolz was way too nice of a guy, he never conveyed what he was feeling, yet you want him to succeed. He is immensely likeable.

Craig sheffer makes a great smarmy rich kid villain.

Mary Ann Stuartson was unbelievable in her role yet she still had a lot of charisma.

Lea Thompson plays, what essentially was for the world of the movie, the most beautiful girl in the high school yet she's not that cute (go figure)

The supporting cast added good comic relief especially the blue collar Dad, social status concerning sister.

In summary, this movie makes a perfect guilty pleasure. John Hughes was a master of his craft in creating the teen angst film. His characters never were invloved in  life threatening issues...justteh day to day tribulations of being a teenager.

I can rip this movie over and over again yet I have also watched it numerous times. It grows on you.

264608,5,6300218031,"I was a teenager in the 80's, so I love all of the old 80's teen movies, but Some Kind of Wonderful makes my top three. The performances were believable - the actors became the characters, not the other way around. Eric Stoltz is a level headed mechanic from the wrong side of the tracks (literally) who wants to pursue art instead of business. Mary Stuart Masterson is his best friend, a tomboy drummer who is secretly in love with him. Lea Thompson is the beautiful girl from their neighborhood who made it into the inner circle of popular rich kids on the basis of her beauty - and her boyfriend. Craig Scheffer is the rich bully boyfriend - and the only off note.

Keith (Eric Stoltz) is interested in Amanda (Lea Thompson) and takes the opportunity to ask her out when she breaks up with her boyfriend. To spite the boyfriend, she says yes. Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson) predicts trouble and their friendship is tested. My favorite line from the movie is when Keith defends Amanda, claiming, ""You can't judge a book by its cover."" Watts cynically replies, ""Yeah, but you can tell how much it's gonna cost."" Finally Watts agrees to help Keith prepare for the date, including helping him ""practice kissing"" - and it's a doozy of a kiss.

Throw in John Ashton as Keith's father, Maddie Corman as his meddlesome sister, and Elias Koteas as the scary guy Keith befriends in detention, and you have a ""wonderful"" movie.",1154131200,7,1418,4.623015873015873

The actors are perfectly cast in the leads. They are so believeable in their portrayals that I could have gone to high school with them. The kissing scene is HOT. Clothes don't need to come off for you to feel the hot wind of chemistry and passion that blows off that first kiss scene.

The characters are not glossy, and that is what I love about John Hughes. He portrays coming-of-age in all its naked and truest glory, not the perfect airbrushed schlock that has come out in later years.

264635,4,6300218031,"Perhaps it was under pressure that John Hughes made this movie, as the reaction to the end of Pretty In Pink caused such uproar.  This was, as so many have pointed out, the ending Pretty In Pink should have had; and, as it turned out, this would be John Hughes's last aclaimed teen dramedy (by both critics and audience) of the 80s.

We are rooting for the overturn of social class and pecking orders once again in High School USA.  Keith, the artistic outcast soft boy, has been mooning over the prettiest, most popular girl in school, Amanda Jones.  Amanda Jones is the arm candy of the typical ego inflated Big Man on Campus, Hardy, and otherwise preoccupied.  The whole time, right under his nose, his friend Watts has been in love with him.  A star crossed lovers' triangle if there ever was one - or perhaps a square, or even another polygon as Hardy cheats.

Keith decides to risk life and limb by crossing the social barriers and asks Amanda out.  Much to everyone's surprise, Amanda accepts (based out of revenge against Hardy's wandering eye), and the drama unfolds.  Watts is jealous enough that she offers to drive them.  Hardy is outraged enough that he attempts to reclaim his Big Man On Campus role by having his loyal minions beat him up and asert himself as the Alpha Male.  Everyone's friends and support systems are cheering or shunning them, and it all culminates on the night of the Big Date and The Party at Hardy's house.

While this movie is full of cheesy quotes here and there, and knowing what I know now I wonder if in fact Watts was a little ""confused"" about her sexuality (she was pushing that butch thing a bit far), it has some heart to it.  Amanda Jones, while uses her feminine charms to get out of detention, isn't the shallow socialite she appears to be and shows that she has strength and character.  Watts, while pretending to be tough as nails and impervious, lets her jealousy show but puts it aside enough to let bygones be bygones.  And Keith, miracle of miracles, sees that Watts is the genuine article and he would prefer her over Amanda Jones.

It's a wonderful thought - hence the title - but, knowing what I know now, I am cynical and somewhat embittered.  I wish I had a nickel for everyone who has chosen the wrong person over the right one, for everyone who has been disappointed, hurt or suffered a heartbreak, and for everyone who acted immaturely, selfish, and abusive.  Some of those people look back, realize their mistake and change for the better, but even more blame the other person and go on doing what they've been doing.  This movie had heart, and it showed us the right thing to do, which is why I gave it 4 stars.

Why not 5?  I wish they had developed that side character of Duncan the Skinhead a little more.  He was threatening and sullen when they first introduced him, but once in detention with Keith became a loyal ally.

Lea Thompson looks appetizing as Amanda Jones and for some reason dumps super cool rich kid Hardy Jens to go out with some dork who is friends with a drummer that looks like she digs chicks. Hardy Jens is pretty much me in high school, but with more money. I wasn't rich in high school, but I was incredibly good looking and carried myself with a quiet confidence that some called arrogance. In the real world, Lea Thompson would never have left me for a poor tool that likes to draw tippy the turtle. The only turtle she would have wanted to see was the giant tortuss in my pants. This movie is such a joke in that this isn't how the real world works. I'm sure some girl in Wisconsin loves this movie thinking that romance is alive and well. I hate to break the news, but hot girls like guys like me, JAbs,Kroll and Burns. They don't dig kids that are art geeks. At the end, the art tool ends up with the drummer chick while Hardy Jens keeps having the best pary. They don't show it, but Hardy Jens probably hooked up with a couple of chicks at the party. I totally understand Hardy Jens. It's hard to have to deal with people that are so far beneath where you are at. Hardy Jens was doing Amanda Jones a favor by dating her. Have you ever heard of great players bringing teammates up to their level. That's what Hardy Jens did for those around him. He brought them up to his level. I think people caught up in this movie miss that fact that popular, good looking people need to surround themselves with others like them. It keeps balance. People need to rewatch this movie and understand that Hardy Jens is all that is right with popular people and this movie is just not possible in real life.",1126656000,6,1725,4.2782874617737
264637,5,6300218031,"Okay, so we all know the old formula--especially back in the 80s:  Boy wants girl who's out of his league while girl he only sees as a friend or doesn't know exists wants him.  Sometimes the genders were reversed.  Always, in 80s teen flicks, we see the same self-important oh-mi-gawd-type characters fill the screen in their high fashion and high hair.  Unlike so many of the decade's movies, however, this one is more timeless than, say, Sixteen Candles or Pretty in Pink which are very much of their time.

What makes this movie effective more than John Hughes' direction or the script are very strong performances by some very talented young people.  The triangle of Eric Stolz as Keith, Mary Stuart Masterson as Watts, and Lea Thompson as Amanda Jones gels on every level and breathes life into a script that might not have taken off with any other combination of the day's most popular teen actors.  It simply worked, and that is that.  If you haven't seen this movie, I advise you to check it out rather than give much away.  It is worth your time, and it will make you smile as much as it will move you.  I'm not saying this just because the movie is from my decade; it's truly a classic across the board, relatable regardless of gender or age, and definitely NOT a waste of your time.",1126051200,4,1293,4.510729613733906

Eric Stoltz takes the place of Molly Ringwald and Lea Thompson & Mary Stuart Masterson do the same for Andrew McCarthy & Jon Cryer.  Mr. Stoltz plays Keith a loner, artistic type who works at a garage and whose best friend is a tom girl, drummer Watts played by Ms. Masterson.  Keith pines after Amanda Jones (Ms. Thompson), one of the most popular girls in school.  Amanda dates the spoiled rich boy Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer) and after they fight, Keith swoops in and asks Amanda for a date, to which she agrees.  Keith finds out that the whole date is just a setup to get him to Jenns' house so he can beat him up, he still continues with the date.  He sets an elaborate evening, dinner at a fancy restaurant, art museum after hours and a set of diamond earrings.  It turns out that Amanda isn't some spoiled rich girl, but a girl from the wrong side of the tracks who sold herself out for popularity.  All the while, Watts is secretly in love with Keith and in the end after a showdown at Jenns' house where he is exposed as a chicken and fraud, Keith realizes his true feelings for Watts and they kiss.  The movie is filled with nice performances by the three leads, but it is the supporting players that give the best performances.  John Ashton is perfectly gruff and pushing as Keith's dad, Maddie Corman is the classic, annoying younger sister, but Elias Koteas steals the show as Duncan, the school thug who befriends Keith.  Mr. Koteas throws out some classic lines.  This was the last film John Hughes would write or director in the classic 80's teen angst vein.  The soundtrack to the film is excellent, featuring no name bands like Flesh For Lulu, The Licking Tins and Furniture and it captures the essence of the films.",1089331200,50,1819,4.509146341463414

Otherwise, this is another typical Hughes film filled with teenagers who are vain and self-important until something that SEEMS significant enters their lives.

It is almost like these beautiful years are the ultimate result of youth fighting through a rapidly changing world where things speed up, and where fighting for independance, emotions and love has become an art. Nothing captures this art better than movies. And there are few who can do this as great as John Hughes.
Yes, ofcourse the 80's are my youthful years and everyone romances his youth, but I am certain that the 60's, 70's were great years, and the 80's is the sum of all that.
Some kind of wonderful takes you right into the 80's rollercoaster with the cool drum scene opening of Mary Steward Masterson , the typical interactions between the teenagers and the punk and wave influences apparent in the clothing. Also the social groups becom clear. The punk-wave guy, the pretty popular girl, the alternative girl, the average normal neighbour boy (Stolz), the spoiled popular macho bratt, etc.
This combination was even enlarged in the best 80's picture ever, the breakfast club. It beautifully captures the different social groups on a highschool.
Some kind of wonderful, makes you happy, gives you that warm, first love feeling in which you would wrap yourself in as in a warm blanket.

The plot of Pretty In Pink is sort of rehashed here: a teen from the poor side of town (Eric Stoltz subbing for Molly Ringwald), has got eyes for a popular teen (Lea Thompson subbing for Andrew McCarthy), and has a free-thinkin', seemingly gay best friend of the opposite gender (Mary Stuart Masterson subbing for Jon Cryer) that winds up being the person they should end up with.  There's even the token jerk that causes problems for everyone (Craig Sheffer subbing for James Spader.)
The original ending of Pretty In Pink was changed after test audiences said they would rather Molly Ringwald's character end up with Andrew McCarthy's, instead of Jon Cryer's.  (Wrong! At least in my opinion.)  They got it right in ""Some Kind Of Wonderful.""  What a great 80's teen flick this is!  Not too sappy, not too dramatic- everything gets balanced out with little drops of humor here and there.  Candace Cameron is hilarious in every one of her scenes (check her out as Eric Stoltz's younger sister before she wound up on TV's migraine headache inducing ""Full House""); so is Maddie Corman who plays the middle sister.  (She later ended up on Margaret Cho's short lived ""All American Girl"" sitcom and was in another GREAT 80's teen flick called ""Seven Minutes in Heaven"" which also starred Jennifer Connelly.)
If you love this movie, or are a fan of the John Hughes genre, you should also check out the ""Some Kind Of Wonderful"" soundtrack.  It's every bit as GREAT as the ""Pretty In Pink"" soundtrack.  The opening credits sequence music from ""Some Kind Of Wonderful"" (""Abuse"" by Propaganda) is not on the cd, but is available on Propaganda's ""Wishful Thinking"" cd.
The only issue I have with this DVD is the same issue I have with a lot of other Paramount DVD's: no extra goodies.  No trailer, no outtakes, no deleted scenes, no commentary.  That is disappointing, but it's still great to have this on DVD finally.",1035244800,156,2137,4.730458221024259

Though this film is a bit far-fetched, it has the best characters (tomboy, skinhead, nerd, popular girl in school, rich fool). I've loved Mary Stuart Masterson since this film, and have made an attempt to see everything she's done since. Lea Thompson had the hardest part, trying to be cool and ""real"" at the same time. Eric Stoltz was never better looking, truly handsome, belying his previous role in ""Mask"" and future independent film projects, as well as carrying the lead role with genuine confidence. Elias Koteas is a real delight as Duncan, the skinhead; later he was in ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" as a romantic lead, and the great Terrence Malick used him to excellent advantage in ""The Thin Red Line"". This film really marks the beginning of many fine film careers. The use of current popular music in all of Hughes' films has always added to their appeal, as well as good writing. This was a little more brutal than ""16 Candles"", but it hit all the right nerves. Also, as a middle-aged baby boomer, the emotions involved, I must say, are as relevent now as then. It was also a pleasure to see John Ashton (""Beverly Hills Cop"") as the dad; he plays the bewildered authority figure very well.

Now, on DVD, you get an excellent transfer and pristine movie theater sound quality.
John Hughes was made famous for capturing teen angst in a way that identified with most teenagers of the period. I think ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" Hughes is at his best with a realistic story about dealing with love, friendship, and peer popularity. There are famous faces that sneek into this character roles that are great fun to watch. But it's the romantic triangle that keeps the story moving until the end.

264713,4,6300218031,"This film is ahead of its time if you consider when it was created. You have skinheads, celtic music (at the end credits) and tomboy (or if you prefer butch) chick long before these things made it out into the mainstream. Remember that this film was released in 1987!
The film owes a lot to its screenplay that must have been written by someone who knew exactly what was going on, to a point where the screenplay is lost on casting director. Thus, for instance, the characters live in the area of Southern California near the Mexican border and they even speak of living in ""sectors"" which is border patrol lingo for different areas. The characters' backgrounds are very believable with a neglected tomboy of a drummer that is punked out and the solid working class hero Keith with artistic talents, one can not help but wonder if Keith was meant to be a Chicano artist from a solid Mexican American family working in a garage and spraypainting murals as his genuine artistic activity. The opening shot of the film points in that direction because it shows Keith crossing over some heavy duty railroad tracks and that has a double significance, first as the right vs wrong side of the ""tracks"" in a small town, but also signifying the border region between the US and Mexico.
The film suffers from casting adults as teenagers, and still more is lost when the casting directr misses out on the cultural idiom. Skinheads are barely recognizable and none of them wear suspenders. The drummer girl, who is apparently  a punk rocker, if you look at the walls in her room, has no tattoos or real piercings, and does not look punk. Also, it is a bit odd to hear relatively flat chested Mary Stuard Masterson worrying about sagging breasts, which sounds like a heavy set person's affliction and which would really not be out of character when you consider her pigging out on takeout food and hanging out at Keith's garage because she has no place to go and no family to eat dinner with.

Unfortunately none of this screenplay realism made it into the film since it was cast with mainstream actors who only interpreted acting a punk, skinhead or a working class hero, but did not look the part. The film is a great romantic comedy with an dynamite opening sequence (Too bad THAT music did not make it onto the soundtrack!), but then its starts straining the bounds of believability with its fairy tale like qualities, which fail as a source of satire. The perfect date takes a good piece of the film is almost unbearable to watch. Putting the girl waiting in the wings as a chauffeur on a date is a great pun, but it's so corny, that it's painful to see.
The actors do a tremedous job, Eric Stoltz giving credence to romantic obssession, something that only Eric Stoltz had been able to do with grace. Mary Stuart Masterson is great as the social outcast with a heart of gold, interaction between them being the best part of the film. The films dialogue is excellent, even in comparison with serious acting films beyond existential dramas with high school as the arena and everyone being a teenager. It loses a star for a few glitches, but it's the best film of its type to come out of the eighties.",1009497600,,3190,4.584938704028021
264714,5,6300218031,"I consider this movie the pinnacle of John Hugh's career.  The movie is a classic love triangle similar to Hugh's previous Pretty in Pink.  It sets up the protagonist Keith (Eric Stoltz) as the misunderstood artist in the 80's high school with his tomboy best friend Wutts (the ever endearing Mary Stuart Masterson.) Keith obsessed with the beauty of Miss Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson),feels inadequate because of his social status e.g. lives ""across the tracks"" very similar to that of Molly Ringwald's Character in Pretty in Pink.  The climax of the movie is Stolz's character taking Amanda Jones out on the perfect date culminating in a faux fight with the antagonist ""richy"" Hardy Genns.  Keith about to be pummelled by Genn's henchmen is saved ""Deus ex Machina"" by his ""noble savage"" friend Duncan whom he befriends in detention.  The movie ends with Keith's realization of his love for his best friend Wutts as they wind up kissing in the rain walking into the moonlight with the timeless line ""You look good wearing my future.""  So although the movie is quite sappy and somewhat predictable, it is still a triumph of the underdog which must always be celebrated.

264717,5,6300218031,"I consider this one of the top five best teen movies of the 80's [Can't Buy Me Love, Breakfast Club, 16 Candles, Weird Science].  Additionally, I think it tops its sibling film, Pretty in Pink. The story of an obvious,  unrequited love in the face of obsession is an old one.  Producer Hughes  has visited it often before and after, but the sincerity and heart-felt  depth of the performances here makes this a special realization. Tomboy  Watts, played by the luminous Mary Stuart Masterson, pines away secretly  for her shy, artistic, mechanic best friend Keith [Eric Stoltz]. Stoltz in  turn lusts after the school beauty Amanda Jones [Lea Thompson]. Villainy of  different degrees is provided by Amanda's snobbish friends, and her current  beau the devilish Hardy Jenss [Craig Sheffer giving us a taste of his  upcoming Nightbreed persona.] I've always had a soft spot for the Hughes  villains; and Hardy as the Corvette driving, Miami Vice homage-ing,  cheating, boyfriend stands up well against the languid lizard-like cool of  James Spader in Pretty in Pink.  Support for Keith is provided by his dad,  younger sisters, and a batch of new friends found in the depths of school  detention.  The movie revolves around Keith's courting of Amanda, and how  Watts must stand idly by while her devotion is deflected.  It becomes even  more heart breaking to observe her chauffeuring the two on their big date;  sobbing as she watches the two kiss in the light of an abandoned concert  venue.  Resolution comes at the party, to Charlie Sexton's Beat So Lonely.  Hardy and Keith square off with the results one might expect.  As this film  ages, after 13 years [!], I continue to enjoy the interplay between the  main characters when I see it.  There really isn't a weak performance all  the way around.  As another reviewer mentioned, this is ultimately a sweet,  reaffirming movie.",960681600,9,1882,4.913738019169329
264718,5,6300218031,"Eric Stoltz, Mary Stuart Masterson and Lea Thompson were all fabulous in this movie.  John Hughes managed to capture the reality of young love.  He was able to show that sometimes it pays to wait for the right one and often  it's who we least expect.  The ""practice"" kiss between Stoltz and  Masterson was one of the best kissing scenes ever!  The music was timed  perfectly....I get a rush every time I see it!  This was one of Hughes'  best movies!",947894400,5,450,4.45679012345679
264739,5,6300218031,"As a person addicted to '80s movies, this is a classic---love, geeks, preps, etc.  The ""practice"" kissing scene between Keith (Eric Stolz) and Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson) is worth buying the movie alone.  Whose heart doesn't skip a few beats when you watch that kind of kiss!  It's a perfect movie for all us John Hughes' fans.",946425600,5,329,4.7368421052631575
264740,5,6300218031,"A simple movie but captures the heart of many.  It brings back the laughters and tears of those highschool days, but it is more than a highschool movie.  If you have seen this movie before, you may remember  Amanda(Thompson) said to Keith(Stoltz) that she rather be alone than be  together for the wrong reason.  Guess there is something to learn from this  1986's teenage movie!  Of course, how can one forget about  Watts(Masterson)when she stole the first kiss of Keith, with the background  music of ""She Loves Me""?  No matter how old you are, you will be  able to find pieces of your life in this movie.",946166400,2,608,4.588785046728972
264741,5,6300218031,"I am not a John Hughes fan, but this disarming movie takes the ""teen"" out of teen flick.  The characters are so keenly drawn, and the poignant, potent romantic entanglements so utterly winning, that  this movie is hard to resist.  Mary Stuart Masterson is simply  heartbreaking in this movie, and unaffecedly so; Eric Stoltz has never been  more appealing, or attractive.  The details follow suit -- from Keith's  realistic family to the Barbie-like world of the ""pretty kids"".  This simple movie earns its well-deserved emotional lift, and remains with  you.",945993600,4,559,5.122222222222222
264742,4,6300218031,"In the wake of all of the hype surrounding the ""Brat Pack"" movies of the 1980's, this bittersweet teen flick gets lost in the fold.  True, it is a ""John Hughes"" film, but it doesn't contain any of  those annoying teens who appear and re-appear in so many of the same  movies.  The best part of this is the young Eric Stoltz.  His portrayal of  the somewhat shy and very sensitive Keith just makes my heart melt. (Where,  oh where, can I find a man like that?) Also, I have to mention the very  hilarious Elias Koteas as Keith's skinhead friend.  That was definitely a  strange role to see him in! Very good film, worth seeing over and over  again.",944697600,8,647,4.308333333333334
264743,5,6300218031,"I think the script of this film is very straight forward. However, Mary played very good. Watts was the type of gal I adore. After watching this movie, I knew what I really wanna be. I wanna be as cool as her! Or simply  like her! She was very generous as well. She could even fix a date for  Keith. And the ending was very happy, too. Guess what. I watched this film  in 1999. But I don't think it is old-fashioned. Olddies is goodies!",925862400,2,436,4.105882352941176

Believe me, this film tells it like it was for  some of us. If my "" buddy "" looked like Mary Stuart Masterson,  there would be a Mrs. in front of my Mr. on our Christmas cards.
