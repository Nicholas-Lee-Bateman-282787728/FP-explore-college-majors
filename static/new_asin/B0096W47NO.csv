5274836,5,B0096W47NO,"As Rainbow Dash has said, OMGOSH, OMGOSH, OMGOSH, OMGOSH, OMGOSH! Thank You so much for this Amazon! I love You guys even more now for making this an exclusive. iTunes has the Seasons but they're, what? About $50? I can't afford that just for 1 Season. Plus the 2nd Season, it would be around $100. This is ridiculously cheap! Knowing Amazon, this couldn't be a scam. They're always been reliable. Hopefully they'll come out with Season 2 later...if You or a friend loves MLP, (*Brohoof* to all the Bronies out there) and You're looking to buy the Seasons, GET IT HERE! Because iTunes is a rip off. And they're digital copies. I dunno about You guys, but I rather have an physical copy. We were waiting, and waiting and waiting for an physical copy an its finally here! My only question is, will there be Bonus Content? If not, I'll still be pre-ordering as soon as possible!",1346976000,8,875,4.579617834394904
5274837,5,B0096W47NO,"It doesn't matter if you'd rather have Blu-ray. Good sales of this will lead to Blu-ray. It doesn't matter if you have access to Netflix streaming or iTunes or YouTube for the episodes. They don't have audio commentary. Find the money for this and support the official release!

Update (11/27/12): According to Seth's review of this DVD on Equestria Daily, the commentaries on this disc are amazing. I share his sentiment even now, and I can confirm my agreement with him after I receive the DVD.

Update (12/13/12): I received my DVD days ago, but I just wanted to confirm that this is a great 4-disc DVD set. The commentaries are especially interesting, although the only new voice credit information that we learned that wasn't already known was that Tabitha St. Germain voiced the stallion who screams in ""The Best Night Ever"" after Rainbow Dash knocks and catches him.",1346976000,185,873,4.852348993288591

5274847,5,B0096W47NO,"This is a review of MLP FIS: Season 1.

Who doesn't love ponies?  And who doesn't want to watch ponies 24/7?

Maybe some of you out there (maybe you are crazy, perhaps?), but now that my daughter received this DVD as her birthday present, that is exactly what our family does.  Ponies all the time.  Eeyupe!

Needless to say, this DVD is the first season of My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic.  If you are looking at purchasing a MLP product, I am guessing you already know what this show is and have an opinion on which season is best.  I will not go there.

Instead, I will talk about the quality of the DVD.  It doesn't skip!  Its about four discs (I don't really know, my daughter is in control of the DVD player and let's no one near it since her birthday).  My daughter also handles the DVDs, and if you know what the hands of children are like, the fact that it hasn't skipped is hard to believe.  It also comes with a link to bonus features, but I have not seen those yet.

Overall, a fine quality DVD for all you pony lovers.  Yah!",1500336000,,1041,4.186868686868687

5274852,5,B0096W47NO,"For starters this review comes four years late.  Been busy and letting the show simmer a bit before writing reviews.

If one has to buy just one season, just to start with or own, it would be this one.  Very simple stories with no overarching episode arcs, simple characterizations of the primary cast and the season can be watched in any order of one's choosing.  There isn't a whole lot of reason to go into what everyone else has said.  The show's animation, music and direction is great here.",1490313600,,496,4.52808988764045

5274892,5,B0096W47NO,As a child of the 80s that grew up with the original MLP series I will admit that I was super hesitant about this new version.  I was pleasantly surprised that I actually enjoy this series! It is appropriate for my 4 year old to watch and yet I find humor in most of the episodes as well.  I actually went back and watched some of the original cartoons from the 80s and I can say that I actually prefer these now.  And on a side note... wow some of the 80's cartoons were weird!  I took me watching them as an adult to really notice all the bizarre stuff in them.,1453334400,,563,4.0

5274897,4,B0096W47NO,"Wonderful price on this 4-disc DVD set with 26 episodes, usually DVD sets of whole seasons of TV shows cost upwards of $30 to buy and have less episodes, this was a great surprise.  I was a fan of My Little Pony in the 80s, and I wasn't sure about the new show, but I've got to say it's very entertaining and funny!  My kids have a couple older Pony DVDs, ""Minty Christmas"" and ""Twinkle Wish Adventure"", though they love the old ones, after watching this, they have brand new favorite characters and episodes, and lets face it, the storylines and characterizations in the Friendship is Magic series make the older pony movies look rather insipid and dull by comparison.  There's much more distinction between pony characters, in the 2 older movies we have, the ponies all really look and act identical, just different colors and symbols, in this show they all have a similar look but strong personalities and different enough styles and voices that you can easily tell them apart.  The show is quite funny too, it's given me a giggle watching it with my girls a few times :)  The only negative thing I have to say is that I dislike when some of the characters appear to be wearing heavy makeup, there's a particular episode with Rarity where she has on a costume with butterfly wings, along with a garish amount of eye-makeup and bright red lipstick, she looks too mature and trashy for a children's show.  I also dislike that MLP has branched out into dolls/shows called ""Equestria Girls"" where the ponies are teenage girls similar in look to Monster High or Ever After High, but that's more an issue with the brand than with this particular show.  Overall it's entertaining and fun to watch, but a few times borders on being too mature for younger kids.",1451347200,,1755,4.605769230769231
5274898,5,B0096W47NO,I haven't actually watched the episodes yet but it's three discs for season one.  I think for special features it says coloring pages and commentaries and from what I hear they are worth getting the boxed set.,1451260800,,209,4.648648648648648

5274901,5,B0096W47NO,"This DVD set has something both for younger and older fans of the show. Kids have singalongs for two songs and coloring sheets (basic stuff for distraction) while older fans have DVD commentaries.

The same artist that did Power Puff girls is in charge of this series.  She does a great job with her team in a creating a story line with good plot and character development with good art and music.  Do I realize the goal is to sell merchandise?  Absolutely!

The children just cannot wait to turn the DVD player on to see these videos. They like them so much, that it is difficult to pull them away for meals, chores, and homework. For the most part, the series teaches all sorts of valuable lessons on Friendship and Character. The only downside, is that my kids have picked up a couple phrases or terms that we are not so impressed with. Like, ""Oh pooh!"" One pony uses this and now we have a hard time getting them to stop. Though you would think this series would be strictly for girls, I have seen many young boys (PreK thru about 2nd grade) enjoy the series.",1441238400,,727,4.352941176470588

Honestly, how do you find unicorns farting rainbows and obsessing about friendship entertaining????? You fan art is awful. Not only that but you ruin good media like Star Wars. Nobody cares about your fandom. Pony art is everywhere and I can't escape. If I google something like Spongebob, I will find pony art. I AM SICK OF IT!!!!!!!!! Get a life and watch something more masculine like Batman. Oh yeah I forgot,you'll ruin and ponyfy that too. This so called this fandom is too much.

5274957,5,B0096W47NO,"The story of my love for this show is a complex one. I watched the original My Little Pony as a kid because I had two sisters and was the only boy. To me there was nothing strange about watching Lady Lovely Locks, Rainbow Brite (the movie rocked!), and Strawberry Shortcake. It was just what we were watching. It wasn't until much, MUCH later that I discovered Transformers, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and the like (my mother didn't like all the violence). Fast forward to my 30's and a funny thing happened at work.

Discovery

A co-worker of mine had a name that sounded a bit like ""pony"" so people so some teasing occurred based on his last name. Then another co-worked mentioned that there was indeed a growing phenomenon of ""bronies"" watching My Little Pony. Knowing only the original show from the 80's and it's immediate sequel shows (having completely missed the brain-dead recent ones) I assumes he was talking about the originals. I looked it up on search engines and started to read article after article on the phenomena. My reaction was immediate ""I must watch this show and know what this is all about.""

Backlash

I couldn't believe how good this show was. Just watching the first two episodes, which were clearly heavily influenced by Sailor Moon, the circuits in my nerd brain were blown. It was so incredibly well done! I begged and pleaded with my wife (a big Sailor Moon fan) to watch JUST THE FIRST TWO EPISODES. She resisted, then relented. Eventually she ended up watching every season so far (four as of this writing) with me. While she enjoyed watching the show ONCE, she's no fan-girl or brony. And my friends and acquaintances are even worse.

I don't really understand why so many people have such a strong aversion to things that target a different demographic, other than perhaps that propaganda has thoroughly washed their brain. Rejecting something ONLY because it appears childish...is a mark of immaturity (Or as C.S. Lewis once said ""Now that I am an adult I have put away childish things such as the need to appear very adult.""). So ironically, many people appear to be too childish to give a kids' show a chance. Go figure.

Genius

I've been a fan of animation from all over the world my entire life. I grew up watching every Disney animated feature and every cartoon on the Disney Channel in the 80's. As an adult I discovered anime classics animated shows and films from the 80's that I missed as a kid. I'm here to tell you, this show is not good. It is a work of genius.

I can't count how many people I told to watch this show said they ""can't stand the singing"". It's hard for me to choke down my gut reaction, which is to call them all sorts of intelligence insulting names. This show has songs that rival the best Disney ever put in a show or on film. Its songs are better than ANY songs currently on the radio. The lyrics are downright brilliant. The melodies are infectious. The song structures are brilliantly executed and wildly inventive. Even songs that I wasn't crazy about at first slowly embedded themselves into my brain until I wanted to listen to them on repeat for hours. And yes, I have finally gotten to the point where I listen to ""At the Gala"" in French and ""Winter Wrap-Up"" in German. The songs are that good. The only music with lyrics I can think of recently that is that good would be the soundtrack from the Disney film Frozen (which I also have international versions of songs for).

If you strip away the iconic characters, gorgeous flash animation (yes, that is possible), catchy songs, adult and pop-culture references, etc, you still would have an exceedingly clever show, which is thoroughly self-aware, and tells an absolutely wonderful story. Our real world is filled with negativity, sex, violence, and hate. I can't watch shows on TV designed for adults that aren't based on cooking or some everyday activity, because modern TV drama for adults makes me sick. The explanation for this programming has always seemed to be that people are simply dark, evil, twisted creatures who crave nothing but these base things for their amusement. But then, out of nowhere something like Friendship is Magic emerges which exceedingly proves that no matter how dismal and dark things get in our modern world, good things come from within the hearts of good people, and simply cannot be suppressed. This is not mindless entertainment. It is a show about growing, and showing love for others on a very deep level. It encourages embracing your identity, cherishing the things that make us different, and true loyalty (to name only a few of the reoccurring themes). The world NEEDS shows like this desperately to teach children (and adults) the life lessons that are constantly being undermined by the screams of mainstream media to be selfish and self-centered.

Aside from that, the characters really are truly outstanding archetypes with amazing depth and goodness, even to the point of being profound. Through the course of the show into the later seasons, you'll see a tomboy who loves sports embrace reading a good book, a refined woman get dirty to make a child happy, a shy mousy animal-lover overcome her fears, an independent spirit learn to rely on others, and an extreme attention-deficit character learn to focus on what truly matters in life. There is something deeply moving about a protagonist who sacrifices for others, a person who gets their entire self-worth of seeing others become happy, and a character who creates art but is only joyous when the creation is for the benefit of others. This is great stuff people.

Conclusions

This is where it all starts. Watch this show and fall under the spell of something truly good that springs from a love of people and everything that makes friendship the wonderful thing it is.

If like me you are a shy nerd who struggles to make friends, this show may make you feel like more as a person. If you have no interest in such things and appreciate a good cartoon you will at the very least find it wildly entertaining. And if you think cartoons are for children, singing is stupid and only weirdos and perverts would want to watch a show for little girls when they are an adult male, I feel deeply DEEPLY sorry for you.",1421712000,12,6245,4.702653247941446

5274960,5,B0096W47NO,"As a 90's kid, I grew up watching shows like Sailor Moon, The Powerpuff Girls, and Rugrats, so my standards for cartoons are higher than this generation's.  I admit, I had a few My Little Pony toys when I was very, very young, but I never really got into the franchise.  Like Barbie, it just seemed too...pink and girly for my taste.  If someone told me how much I love this series now, I wouldn't have believed them.

To really understand why so many people of all ages and genders love it, you've gotta see it for yourself.

First off, the animation is amazing for a children's show - and I'm extremely picky about animation!  The colors are beautiful and I love how the backgrounds are done.  One of my favorite things is the hilarious expressions the ponies make.  The way Pinkie Pie's eyes bug out six inches from her head and close ups of Rarity grinding her teeth make me laugh out loud.  (I think this show is highly funny, I find myself laughing in each episode.)

The opening theme is cute and super catchy!  I never skip it.  Some episodes feature songs which are all well-written and well-sung (who doesn't love ""At the Gala"" and ""Winter Wrap Up""?).  The background music is just as good, too.  The DVDs come with awesome extras including Sing-a-Longs and Commentaries.  If I had to say anything bad, it would be that I wish this was a Blu-ray release.

I think the show's strong point is the variety of well-developed characters and plots.  Every pony is different, but they're not one-dimensional.  A lot of shows make the mistake of making ""flat"" characters (ex: The Jock, The Band Geek, The Brain, The Goth, etc.) but MLP does not.  While Twilight Sparkle is smart, that's not all she's limited to.  The same goes for the rest of the characters.  Rarity may be the most fashion-oriented pony of the gang, but she didn't hesitate to chop off her tail and give it to the sea monster as a new mustache in the first episode (LOL, don't ask).  I also love how Rainbow Dash is a badass lesbian icon for gay girls like myself.  This show is also feminist, providing a realistic variety of female characters, showing girls you can be whoever you want; silly and random, shy and kind, or honest and hardworking.  What I love most is that not all the ponies are materialistic, boy-crazy, cardboard cut outs of each other that you see in so many little girl shows.  Kudos, to the creator, Lauren Faust!

At the end of each episode, Twilight writes a letter to the Princess with the help of her baby dragon, Spike, telling her what she's learned about friendship.  I love that this show has substance and teaches kids valuable lessons about friendship, yet isn't too preachy and manages to entertain along the way.  Those kind of cartoons have been hard to come by in the past few years.

All in all, I highly recommend this show to EVERYBODY.  If you like Sailor Moon or Kaleido Star, Disney movies, Barbie, Hey Arnold, or The Wild Thornberries, you'll love it.  Heck, even if you don't, you still might like it!  My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic has something magical about it, allowing it to reach outside the demographic of 8-year-old girls.  And that right there says something.

So if you've wondered what all the hype is about, watch it and you'll see!  It's the best cartoon I've seen in ages, and it goes without saying I'm purchasing the rest of the DVDs too!",1419811200,2,3376,4.5514950166112955

5274982,5,B0096W47NO,"I could scant have created a more uncannily metaphysical vehicle carrying forth the message that all truth is a lie, all morality a fiction, and that the only reality is the will to gain power. Indeed, when you gaze into the the MLP:FiM, the MLP:FiM also gazes into you; the deeply disturbing happenings of the Land of Equestria holding up a mirror to our tortured society and serving as an ever-present reminder of the futility of all values systems. My five-year-old loved it! With brilliant irony and subversion, Director Jayson Thiessen uses Twilight Sparkles journey to perfectly encapsulate the doctrine of Eternal Recurrence, with Twilight Sparkles ever-shifting quest to construct the concept of Harmony clearly showing that time is itself a fiction and that we are all, in the end, trapped in an eternal and ultimately meaningless cycle of vapid self-affirmation. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, the picture quality is good but not great for those used to full 1080p video.

I must issue a spoiler alert here, but as you might expect, my favorite episode is Season Twos gloriously titled Lesson Zero, in which Twilight Sparkle realizes that the best way to ensure that she solves a problem is for she herself to deliberately create an even greater problem, thus revealing the elemental myth behind Ponvyvilles supposedly fixed values system and removing the fig leaf of morality from power structure of the town. Twilight Sparkles subsequent journey to prepare for the Grand Galloping Gala serves as the series own bermensch, laying bare the ultimate consequences of the death of God and inevitable march into nihilism.

The best I can come up with is its a show that is almost impossible to watch without a smile, I mean they  literally play this show to kids and adults that are dying of cancer to cheer them up, and there are countless examples of it working =)

I was hooked into the series and soon brought my daughter to watch it and she loved it.

Many people frown when they hear of an male adult enjoying this show, mainly because it is perceived as a girls' show. In this age, I think girls' and boys'shows is a misconception. Good stories can be fun and connect with a wider audience if they are told in an intelligent way. Yes, there is definitively a feminine side to the ponies, but the way the writers were able to make this a show about adventures, mythological monsters, powerful princesses and powerful villains that had an interesting background, it made me realize how much i enjoyed watching cartoons when I was a kid.

This is a great series, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see how kids' shows can be intelligent even when being sensitive to its audience.",1387497600,,1038,4.56989247311828

I'm a native Spanish (Latin America) and I would buy this dvd's as fast as I could if they were with spanish included audio too, to tell you the truth I HATE, really really HATE the Spanish dubbed version, but if I'm going to bribe my mom into buying it they must be capable of watching it too or to be able to watch it with my niece and they don't speak english so, there's no possible way for me to be able to buy it sadly enough.
After all I'm a brony with parents that don't really like to buy too childrish stuff (They can take some of it but other stuff no, for example the MLP toys which I would love to have, at last the mane 6 and the CMC or just Rainbow she is my fav after all..) so the only possible way that I can make them buy it is saying that is for me to watch with my little niece (even though they know it's mostly for me lol)

But yeah, I just wanted to point that out, it's really a sad thing but that's how it is.

5275038,5,B0096W47NO,"Friendship is Magic - A defiant Twilight Sparkle refuses obey her Queen's orders to make friends, and nearly dooms Equestria to eternal night. The inability of both sides to negotiate causes a government shutdown, presciently describing the American political landscape of 2013.

The Ticket Master - Friendships are nearly destroyed as the girls each try and bribe Twilight Sparkle for her extra ticket to the Grand Galloping Gala.

Applebuck Season - The most honest of the Mane Six lies to herself, and nearly destroys her family business, almost kills Rainbow Dash, causes a mass food infection that nearly destroys the Cake family's business reputation, and starts a rabbit stampede.

Griffon the Brush Off - The girls show their true colors when they trust a stranger more than Pinkie Pie. Acts of shoplifting and bullying go unpunished.

Boast Busters - Two incompetent young ponies nearly destroy Ponyville and are rewarded for their acts of vandalism by being given magical mustaches.

Dragonshy - Fluttershy nearly kills her friends by causing an avalanche. The Mane Six force a dragon to abandon his horde of gold and jewels.

Look Before You Sleep - A third wheel at a slumber party, Twilight's incessant need for adolescent games ruins the lesbian tensions between Applejack and Rarity, causing them to bicker pointlessly.

Bridle Gossip - A pun on ""gossip's bridle"", a medieval punishment used on women who were nagging excessively or were otherwise verbally abusive or unpleasant, which all of the Mane Six earn. A token black character is introduced.

Swarm of the Century - Rarity manages to turn a rapidly multiplying species of semi-sentient creatures into sweat shop laborers. Pinkie Pie steals musical instruments from all around town, and never returns them.

Winter Wrap Up - Mayor Mane's incompetence is on full display, and only the anal-retentive Twilight Sparkle can save the town from a series of disasters she herself created.

Call of the Cutie - Three under-performing blank-flanks form a clique in order to convince themselves that their inability to self-actualize is a good thing.

Feeling Pinkie Keen - Pinkie Pie harasses Twilight Sparkle until she has a psychotic episode and nearly undergoes Spontaneous Pony Combustion.

Sonic Rainboom - Rarity assaults the Wonderbolts. Rainbow Dash causes a dangerous explosion while trying to save them.

Stare Master - Fluttershy's hypnotic abilities leave all of Ponyville pondering just how truly free they are when an unstoppable mind-controlling pony lives among them.

Green Isn't Your Color - Twilight Sparkle proves she can't be trusted with even the least important secrets. Fluttershy's anorexia finally pays off.

Over a Barrel - Applejack and Spike have a shared psychotic episode that leaves them thinking they can talk to trees. A group of native buffalo are saved only by the intervention of more civilized ponies.

A Bird in the Hoof - Fluttershy tortures an animal to death, everyone laughs at the end.

The Cutie Mark Chronicles - The sinister machinations of Celestia are revealed when the Mane Six discover their entire lives have been manipulated by fate to bring them together.

Owl's Well That Ends Well - Men are stupid jerks. But this is MLP:FIM, you knew that already.

Party of One - Pinkie Pie has a psychotic episode because nobody will play with her every day, any time she wants. The symbology of MMORPG players is lost on nobody.

The Best Night Ever - Applejack, Fluttershy, Rarity, Pinkie Pie, and Rainbow Dash each cause a disaster at the Grand Galloping Gala, which is why Celestia only gave Twilight Sparkle one ticket in the first place, and that was meant for Spike. She covers up her mistake by declaring it her intent all along.

The morals of the stories will resonate with adults and children alike, and there are enough jokes for both the target audience AND the adults that everyone will enjoy watching this wonderful cartoon.",1378166400,,514,5.130952380952381

I can consider myself an Classics person, I like old Disney animation and also Japanese anime animation as well.

Like a friend of mine, I am collecting old prominent TV cartoons from my childhood to show my future children. While MLP was not one I watched as a child, it was invigorating, amusing and an exceptional take of moral choices and other virtues.",1376784000,,608,4.527272727272727

When we all need a break, I put this on for her (and sit and watch it too) and we just let it run. She is engrossed (we are not tv people) but I let her watch this as much as she likes because of the lessons it teaches. She doesn't get some humour that I know adults will get (and I have giggled at a few) but she really enjoys the show nonetheless. We run all of Season One, then all of Season Two, and back all over again (will need to get our hands on the 3rd season asap!). We also have the book The Elements of Harmony, The Official Guidebook (which you really need if you love this show). We love the songs, the lessons, and all-in-all, it is a perfect package. Very suitable for her age at the moment, and I'm sure for the years to come. Definitely worth the money (and certainly better than the pain of re-watching limited copies on YouTube).

Twilight Sparkle ends up meeting the following ponies who accompany her on various adventures: Applejack, Rarity, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Pinkie Pie. My favorite episode from season 1 of the series would have to definitely be part 2 episode 2 of ""Friendship is Magic"".

My favorite pony is Pinkie Pie, because she's a happy-go-lucky pony. This show teaches us about friendship, and showing us what friendship really is about. Also, my favorite episodes are 'Feeling Pinkie Keen' and 'Party of One'. In fact, some other ponie should be in Season 4 such as Surprise and Firefly. I alway wanted to have Surprise being voiced by Stephanie Sheh, because she's also cute, cheerful and full of fun!

5275070,5,B0096W47NO,"It may seem a bit of a pain and a little extreme to watch a DVD on a laptop or even a PC over a DVD player but where it's not been released in the UK I took matters into my own hands and I actually bought a programme called VLC media player with a codec pack to watch US media but needs must to watch Ponies so any UK Bronies out there download VLC by what ever means suit you and buy this.

The DVDs themselfs are amazing much more fun than watching them on the net the only drawback is you can 1080p them but that does not fuss me at all. The packaging was kinda OTT for a DVD even if it was Ponies it was a box filled with bubblewarp and then one of the usual things you get games and DVDs in. They must have known what was inside or something for this much protection not that I'm complaining the box provides much amusement for e ferrets so it was a win win day I get my ponies ferrets get a box! The extras you get are the usual commentarys film company's give and the fun ones are SINGALONGS I love them, I had my friend that is a Brony come over and we sang along to them and had a good laugh.
To sum up its a must buy for any Brony just remember if you not US to uses a multi region DVD player or have VLC Media Player with the codec pack on your PC or Laptop. FYI I'm 23 and love this show its a great way to pass time and its very funny too!",1372464000,,1352,3.76056338028169
5275071,5,B0096W47NO,"Some might think that this is just a kids show and others might think it only attracts Bronies.  But I really think it's great for the whole family.  There are a lot of things that kids will enjoy about it and it's also great for keeping adults entertained as well.  Just little funny quips here and there, little moments in the show where you laugh because they show homage to something, especially in the sci fi/fantasy world.  Definitely a great show for the inner geek in all.

I grew up in the generation that had the original MLP and I was never a super huge fan of it.  But this revamp of it is awesome! The kids (a boy and a girl) and I started watching this show on the HUB a while back and they loved it.  I think it is very well put together, humorous, and taught some great life lessons.  The songs in it are really good and great for singing along with. They even slightly joke about the cheesiness of song singing in shows in a few episodes but I will happily say that all the songs are well written, catchy and funny at times.  It's in my opinion a great learning show for kids rather than just a show for simple entertainment like other kid shows are that have been revamped, i.e pound puppies, strawberry shortcake.

My husband has also gotten into watching the show with the kids and we have watched through season 3, which we were very excited even when they started season 2.  I was very happy to see that they have started putting the actual seasons out on DVD rather than just a few of the episodes together on random DVD's collections.  I can not count how many times my kids have sat inside on rainy days to watch this DVD.

I would highly recommend this show to anyone!  I have on a few occasions tuned some of my other adult friends onto the show simply by having it playing in the background for the kids when we have company and you just can't help but be drawn in at times. :)

I will add that while it does have the commentaries and a few other bonus features on it, that's not the reason I purchased this. I know that there are some folks who feel like this should have more bonus stuff and be in Blue Ray.  I purchased this because my kids love the show and I wanted to support the show with my purchase thus maybe encourage the creators to make more seasons, release more seasons on DVD and maybe hopefully one day put out all that extra stuff that hardcore fans want.",1372377600,2,2401,4.243956043956044

5275102,5,B0096W47NO,"A few years back, a friend of mine (an adult male friend no less) approached me and told me I needed to watch the latest ""My Little Pony"" TV show, as it was ""awesome!""  I merely laughed politely and shrugged the suggestion off.  I remembered playing with My Little Ponies as a child and watching bits and pieces of the show, but even in those days I was more of a He-Man and Thundercats fan despite being a girl.  And nowadays my primary interests run more towards Star Wars, Transformers, and the Avengers than anything pink and frilly.

Then I actually sat down to watch the show... and was quite pleasantly surprised.  What has traditionally been a merchandise-driven franchise aimed at little girls has become a clever, character-driven, and entertaining series that can be enjoyed (and quite frequently is) by any age and gender.

In Equestria, a fantasy land populated by colorful, sentient ponies, a bookish and somewhat antisocial young unicorn named Twilight Sparkle is shipped off to the small town of Ponyville by her mentor and the ruler of Equestria, Princess Celestia, with orders to try and make some friends.  Twilight balks at first, weirded out by the eccentric inhabitants of Ponyville and more concerned with her studies.  It takes an ancient prophecy coming true, and the threat of Celestia's vengeful sister Nightmare Moon, to make Twilight realize that friendship has a power all its own, and it will take all her strength as well as the help of her newfound friends -- brash and tomboyish Rainbow Dash, shy animal lover Fluttershy, vain but kindhearted Rarity, down-to-earth workaholic Applejack, and crazy but enthusiastic Pinkie Pie -- to protect Ponyville and Equestria.

Somehow this show, despite looking cutesy and girly on the surface, has managed to hit the right balance between kid-friendly and adult appeal.  It focuses primarily on the characters, with good character-driven stories, strong continuity between episodes, and jokes and references that make nods to the adult audience without veering into inappropriateness.  The characters make good role models for children as well -- they don't just focus on fashion or shopping or stereotypical ""girly"" stuff, but have their own goals and desires that they work to achieve, and have a multitude of different personalities so children can pick a character they feel they can identify closely to.  And most episodes end with a moral of some sort, which gives parents an opportunity to discuss the show and what can be learned from it with their children.

The voicework is very well done as well -- every character has a distinctive and fitting voice, and you would never guess that some of the characters are voiced by the same voice actor/actress (such as Applejack and Rainbow Dash).  And even the songs are fun, catchy and cute.  Hopefully someone thinks to release an album outside of a fan project...

The animation in the show is very good -- a smooth Flash-based animation, with colors that are bright and eye-catching without being over the top.  The world is imaginatively designed, altered just enough to accommodate for its four-legged inhabitants without being rendered totally unrecognizable to viewers.  And the show incorporates a surprising amount of mythology, including not just unicorns and pegasi but dragons, manticores, hydras, and other mythical creatures (later seasons of the show even make reference to wendigos and Cerberus, the three-headed guardian of the gates of Tartarus).  That and for being a little kid's show, it has some truly epic and sinister villains...

I never thought I'd say this, but... I like My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic.  Call it a guilty pleasure, but it's a fun, clever, and entertaining cartoon series, geared to appeal to a wide spectrum of viewers and not just little girls.  Hasbro and the Hub have a winner here, and I hope they keep the series going strong in Season 4.",1364860800,7,3918,5.023183925811438

5275125,5,B0096W47NO,"When I was 5 years old in the 80s, I got my first My Little Pony - Cotton Candy. Throughout my growing up and beyond, my sister and I loved the ponies more than any other toy. They inspired amazing creativity and we made up stories, hilarious voices and art based around them. I always knew they were the coolest thing going and were so much better than a Barbie or some babydoll. To this day I have hundreds of MLPs from a lifetime of collecting and admiration.
So imagine my surprise, when I heard about the newest incarnation of MLP from a 35 year old male friend! I knew that if a grown man was that excited over ponies, there was something good going on. Lauren Faust (of Powerpuff Girls fame) breathes incredible new life into my beloved pony folks. Ponies were awesome when I was a kid, but this show is better than anything we ever had! The stories are meaningful, never 'dumbed-down' and hilarious (reminding me of the tales my sister and I used to make up), voice acting is flawless and wonderful, the songs and score are so well-written and progress the plot, and the artwork and color are outstanding! I have started creating pony art again from being so inspired by this show.
Add to it, a vibrant, talented community of 'bronies' (adult fans of the show) and the fact that the actors, writers, artists, etc. who MAKE the show are genuinely caring, generous people and you have a fantastically winning combination.
A huge 'THANK YOU!' to Lauren and everyone involved for bringing my favorite little ponies back to life and investing them with a richness that will truly make them immortal.",1362873600,,1602,4.585365853658536

5275149,5,B0096W47NO,"I just spent a few minutes reading some of the reviews and enjoyed a laugh.  For me, this started because I was a MLP fan growing up 15-20 years ago.  My daughters have two Rubbermaid tubs full of ponies from that era.  When I saw that they were remaking the show, we found it on The Hub and my 5 and 7 year old daughters fell in love.

The show is cute.  The songs are cute.  The characters are cute.

As a mom, I like that (with rare exceptions like at the Gala and Big Mac) the show is all about girls.  Rainbow Dash is not your typical girly girl, but Rarity is.  They each have unique talents and personalities and that's a great thing for kids to recognize.  There isn't a romantic twist in each episode trying to teach them that their lives, wants, desires, goals should revolve around a relationship with a boy.  Overall, there is a moral to each story and a lesson learned that can translate to the real world.  I don't worry about what my kids are learning when they're watching MLP.  In this day and age, that's worth a LOT.

My kids just love the show.  They could care less about what I said above.  It's fun, they know the songs and sing them at random times when they aren't watching TV, too.

Now, would I watch the show on my own without my kids?  Probably not.  But I have caught myself putting down my Kindle when I'm in the living room and they are watching an episode I haven't seen before.  AND, I've caught myself with some of the songs stuck in my own head, too.  And I think that says an awful lot about a kids' show -- when the score is good enough for an adult to appreciate it, that's pretty cool.  :)",1362614400,,1629,4.153846153846154

Shout Factory, the company that released DVD Sets of Tintin, Sonic the Hedgehog, Inspector Gadget, and Power Rangers, has released this Season on DVD, but not before releasing compilation DVDs that came before it; Friendship Express, A Royal Pony Wedding, and Crystal Kingdom.

All 26 Episodes of this Season. Only one little complaint, though; Cadence appears on one of the discs, and we don't actually see her, along with Shinning Armor, and Discord until Season 2, which BTW, Shout announced they would be working on, so look forward to that soon. I know I will.

All in all, even though I have not yet watched my DVD copy of this, I can actually choose to watch it if, and when I wish too, but I don't have to watch it to know how special this show started out. Season 3 has come, and gone, but I heard rumors that Season 4 will be on the way, so I hope to see that sometime soon.

There are a number of bonus's on the disk. The highlight of which is the audio commentaries from a number of the staff involved in creating the episodes. Although only a few new details are found in these commentaries it is interesting to hear about the episodes from those who produced them.

At the beginning, I didn't want to watch ""My Little Pony Friendship is Magic"" and I thought ""What? a remake of one of the worst cartoons of the eighties? I will never watch this nullity!""
Then, I learned that Lauren Faust was working on this new series and I liked a lot one of her previous cartoons ""The Powerpuff Girls"" (Craig McCracken was the creator but Lauren Faust was one of the best writers and directors of the Powerpuff Girls).
I was also very impressed by the huge success of Friendship is Magic on the web. Finally I have decided to give it a chance...

And I don't regret it: ""My Little Pony Friendship is Magic"" is AWESOME!

The draws are beautiful, the animation is excellent, the heroines are lovable and the stories are exciting and very entertaining.
And above all, the humor is absolutely hilarious! the slapstick gags, the misunderstandings and the pun makes me laugh a lot!
My Little Pony Friendship is Magic is the best remed against the depression!

It's also a cartoon very clever, and there is a real evolution of the heroines during the series. Many stories are also very touching.

My Little Pony Friendship is Magic is one of the best cartoons that I have ever seen, It's a real gem! It's cute, funny, intelligent and absolutely great.

Everyone can enjoy this wonderful cartoon. I highly recommend it!

The edition DVD is very good. The image and the sound are good and the audio commentaries are interesting.

Her favorite pony is Fluttershy, because she loves animals and takes care of them, which my little girl also wants to do when she grows up.  There are good messages about friendship, loyalty and doing what is right.  There's also some sneaky humor that adults can enjoy.

With the creative power of Lauren Faust and crew, with the experience of shows such as The Powerpuff Girls behind them, this new version features redesigned characters, new plots (sic) and a style of writing that has gone beyond its target demographic, spawning a whole new following that few expected

However, after receiving it and re-watching the entire seas (TWICE!), I am proud to say that it was WELL worth the money. Having easier access and being able to watch on my larger tv screen was nice.

The box it comes in in very vibrant with a slip cover featuring new vectors of the characters and inside it has 4 DVD's set in a sturdy multi-disk attatchment.

The menu of the DVD itself is snazzy and easy to navigate. You go on the episode list for the 1 of 4 DVD's the series spans and from there you can choose to have the audio commentary on the episodes that have it.

The commentary features Andrea Libman (Fluuershy and Pinkie Pie), Tabitha St Germain (Rarity, Luna), Cathy Wesluck (Spike, Mayor Mare), Nicole Olivers (Celestia, Cheerilee), Director Jason Theison and a few other members of the DHX team such as animators, art design and music. It's great to hear them all bouncing off each other, they obviously spend a lot of time with each other and it shows with the flow and fun in the commentary. The actors remark about specifics they like and dislike, how it was acting certain parts. The directors point out little errors and how hard some seemingly simple parts are, set design and dresses etc.

I highly recommend this DVD, I was bursting out laughing at the commentary and it's great to own a piece of MLP.",1357948800,,1237,4.484444444444445
5275259,4,B0096W47NO,"This was a great show with a great release. I'd prefer if it'd also be released in Bluray, and in stores, but oh well....Anyways, one of my main complaints about this release is that some of the character outlines, specifically Rainbow Dash on her mane, has slight blur. A minor issue, but one wonders why it doesn't look as good as it does on screen. Also, this show, while good, is not perfect. Characters are archetypical, songs are often annoying (though, I don't like singing in most tv shows, so....), and characters themselves can be outright annoying at times. And yet, this show, it has an adorable charm to it, with a great art style that draws viewers in and great writing to keep the viewers watching. The animation is very smooth for Flash animation (though I'm not too familiar with animation in cartoons, but this does have good animation) The show is also surprisingly entertaining even for non children and non-girls. A show for all ages, really. Overall, it's jolly good show, and I recomend watching it and buying this release.

It's unfortunate, however, that Lauren Faust did not participate in the commentary, I would have enjoyed hearing Lauren herself and about her influence from the start and throughout season one. Despite this, she's mentioned numerous times throughout the 6 or 7 episodes of commentary and is well credited. Overall I regret nothing from this purchase. It's a great way to support the series (besides buying pony toys) and at the same time get an inside peak at the amazing talent behind this incredibly unique show.",1357776000,,666,4.955357142857143
5275261,5,B0096W47NO,"It's interesting to find a show that's got great FLASH animation, good voice acting and surprisingly well written characters.

it seems with most shows aimed at young girls, producers always shoot for vapid, shallow and flat, cardboard cut out uninteresting characters with the basic problems of ""what should I wear' or ""does he like me?"".
Really, My Little Pony Friendship is Magic is a perfect representation of a nonsexist show for young females.

Each character is a strong character who has a personality all there own.
An unlike past kid shows each of the mane six are in fact adults.
They have jobs and actually work to provide for themselves which is such a change from many of the other shows out there.

The content of the show works on a lesson an episode basis where the cast will learn something of value.
This however doesn't come off as something that insults the intelligence of the viewer, nor does it come off as a redone concept.

In the past there are cartoons that have done the P.S.A. at the end of an episode but this isn't the case here.
This doesn't do the P.S.A, at least not in the traditional sense.
The characters don't talk to the audience at the very end to see if you got the lesson but rather do a real brief summary in the form of a letter written to their friend and mentor the princess of the kingdom which they all reside in.

The work on this series is top notch and only progresses to get better with each passing season.

Flash animation is rarely good and usually done on the cheap to squeeze out something to sell kids on a product.

See ""Shezow"" if you want a prime example of why flash animated shows are usually trash.

MLP however, has amazing animation arguably the very best I have ever seen for flash animation.
in fact its really raised my bar and for me to even begin to respect an animated flash show it better be somewhere near the caliber of MLP.
We can all hope for a season two release to follow soon for those of us who enjoy this series.",1357776000,,1995,4.416893732970027

5275283,4,B0096W47NO,"This DVD is for the ultimate My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic completionist - a DVD omnibus of the first season with bonus commentaries (on a few episodes) for adult fans and sing-alongs and colouring sheets for the kids.

However, one gripe I have with this DVD is the picture quality - the main feature is presented in 480p, making the picture appear blurry and indistinct at times. It does great injustice to a show that was designed to be shown in high-definition 1080p, especially with knowing one can view episodes on iTunes and YouTube with that kind of picture quality for a cheaper price (or even for free).

The commentaries themselves are very good, and it's clear that everyone (the director, animators, voice actors) has great chemistry. It's also very insightful, as it gives the audience a rather detailed idea of what exactly goes into the show. We get some information about what makes a good story, a good score and a good approach to acting and developing a character via these commentaries. Also, it's great to listen to some of the VAs slip into character outside the context of the show! There's even some allusions to the fandom and their mythology! In fact although the commentaries are not present on every episode, this set is worth buying and shipping for them alone.

As for the main feature itself, many bronies before me have said it already. It's an amazing show that teaches ethics, social skills and, of course, friendship, in a way that doesn't underestimate the intelligence of its target audience. This, combined with its top-notch animation, writing and acting have made it become the show that attracts adults a well as children.

All in all, if you feel that you can compromise on picture quality for the good commentaries and the great story, then I definitely recommend this purchase.",1357171200,,1828,4.8493589743589745

Had a problem with a scratch on disc 1. Not sure if I dropped it or scratched it in some way or if it came this way. This is why I like Blu-ray, scratch-resist disc protection. I tried cleaning the disc, but no luck. Basically the entire last half of Apple Bucking Season is unplayable.

The audio commentary are a great bonus. There's about 1-2 episodes per disc that have them. No subtitles at all, so the DVDs aren't deaf friendly. For the sing alongs there's just two songs: The extended opening theme and At The Gala. There's short profile clips for the main six and Celestia. It also includes downloadable coloring sheets, but that's not really much of a bonus.

Basically, if you've already seen the show, this set doesn't have much for you. It looks decent enough on an HD TV, but the flaws will show through from time to time.

Sadly, these commentary tracks do not include Lauren Faust which would probably provide more insight, however they do include show writers, producers, animators and voice talent.

DVD's are great, however with increasing screen resolutions of TV's, computers and mobile devices, the 480p format of DVD's is quickly becoming obsolete.

Outlines and details disappear. Maybe it's just my laptop, and would work better on a more sophisticated system - but I shouldn't need to fiddle around with cinematic settings just to make it look as good as it does on Youtube.

This show is MADE for 1080p.  it looks gorgeous, sharp and lush in 1080p, so, to see this in disgusting 480p, i just kind of went with it.  It was rather bittersweet, knowing that I'm watching the commentaries that I waited so long for, but they were in this horrible looking format.  I was contemplating just bringing up youtube on my ps3, leaving the commentary going (playing through my soundbar) and just watched them in the 1080.

5275313,5,B0096W47NO,"I've waited for a official DVD of My Little Pony since I first saw the series because it is a different feeling to have something standing in your shelf than to watch it all on Youtube. Therefore, as soon as I found out when it would be published, I ordered it already in the pre-sale with fast transport, so that it would arrive only two days after the official release day in the US.
As I live in Europe, Germany to be exact, it wasn't very cheap but totally worth it!

Season 1 comes as a 4-DVD-Box including not only all 26 episodes but also two Sing-Alongs, 5 coloring sheets (Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Rarity and Twilight Sparkle) and an Audio commentary to the 26th episode (which is very fun to hear :D ). It is a great bundle.

I missed very few things: I was a little sad that there are no coloring sheets of Fluttershy, Spike, Princess Celestia, Luna and Derpy. And as I really love to sing (which I was mostly encouraged by the show) I would have loved to have more Sing-Alongs.

But still, this is a great DVD! And I think that every Brony should own a copy...",1355616000,3,1084,4.303921568627451

Show your support. Tell Shout Factory that we want this and hopefully future seasons. I give this a major recommendation.",1355443200,,402,4.583333333333333
5275315,4,B0096W47NO,"Before I begin, I will say that I am an adult fan of the show (i.e., I'm a brony), and have been a fan since July 2011. I'm not going to elaborate on why the show is good, since many keystroke presses have been dedicated to that already with the other reviews - this is strictly on the DVD set I received yesterday.

The DVD set comes in a single DVD case with four disks inside of it. The last disk contains all of the extras, such as the sing-alongs and the coloring sheets. It's pretty plain, with no other physical extras, but serves its role well.

Since Youtube/Netflix is already host to episodes from the show (many of them in 1080p quality), the only real reason to get these are the commentaries from people who've worked on the show. It's good to hear a lot about the behind the scenes work that goes into making such a cartoon - and this is especially valuable for adult fans of the show.

I would only getting this for only the commentaries, or if you are a big enough fan of the show to shell out $27 for such a set to complete your MLP: FiM merchandise shrine. But if you are a less rabid fan, then save your money and get some homespun merchandise off Ebay or We Love Fine instead.

For parents who have kids who love the show (yes, fans of such a demographic do exist, despite how loud bronies are), this is an excellent set to keep your kids entertained on the road or away from the house.

Overall, get it for the commentaries, to complete your merchandise shrine, or if you have kids that love the show.",1355443200,,1523,4.2379310344827585

Your loyal subject,

-Inky Quills

P.S. I'm attaching a the complete first season of your faithful student's studies of friendship. It's all 26 episodes across four disks, and six episodes have audio commentary with the part of crew and the voice cast of the series: ""Friendship is Magic"" part 1 & part 2, ""Winter Wrap Up,"" ""Suited For Success,"" ""Show Stoppers,"" and ""The Best Night Ever."" Unfortunately, Twilight, Rainbow Dash, and Applejack weren't able to sit in that day, as you would know. And, the DVDs are only in English without any subtitles.

But, still, totally worth it for anypony who likes ponies.

5275328,5,B0096W47NO,"First off, this show is fantastic. The writing is top notch, the animation is beautiful and the voice acting is fantastic. I'm a new ""brony"", only coming to the show as it starts it's third season. I finally decided to see what the fuss was about and caught it on netflix and was very pleasantly surprised. The message of love, tolerance and friendship is really uplifting in this day of enmity and general nastiness, especially on the Internet. I always feel better after watching an episode and it continues to make me laugh and smile (I'm looking at you Pinkie pie!). It's more than just the standard children's sugar show though, with really good writing and characters that you will instantly love. I recommend the show to both children and adults who want a fun good time show with good messages like tolerance and friendship.

As far as the DVD itself goes, it's okay. The quality of the video is decent coming from a DVD and the art style works okay even on a HD tv. There are several episodes with commentary and a few small extras on the last disk. My few nitpicks are I wish there was subtitles included on the DVD, both for the actual content and the commentary as the commentary can sometimes be hard to hear. I wish we could have also gotten Lauren Faust, the original creator of MLP to provide commentary, not really sure why that didn't happen. I personally would have preferred a blu-ray with many more features. For example, more commentaries or even two commentary tracks. One from the actors and one for the developer/writers/etc maybe? Making of videos or content created especially for the blu-ray. Video interviews with cast and crew. Maybe a look at the brony/pegasister culture.

Overall though, it's a great show and this is the only hard copy you can get for the entire first season. I'm greatly looking forward to more MLP content, especially the second season DVD.",1355011200,2,1893,4.698795180722891

5275330,5,B0096W47NO,"So DVD box contains 4 disc spanning all 26 episodes of the show of course, but what makes this unique and a must get is the fact that their is commentaries on this thing. From the Director to animator to actors to even the music master himself (Daniel Ingram) {Sorry Lauren Faust couldn't make it to this one but, if this sells good maybe we might see her in Season Two commentary}.

But let's talk about the show. Why is this so good? Why does anyone care about it, it's ponies!? Well to answer it simple it's magic! Ha ha ha,,, ugh. Honestly though it's because of how it was written, how it was animated and drawn, how the actors gave life to the characters, and how the overall feel of the show is about acceptance. We've all been there where you don't feel like you belong and you'd rather just live your life alone and away from everyone. In this show it tells us that even the difference that separate us, the weakness, the problems, and the challenges, can still be an important part of us and can be overcome by a simple thing. FRIENDSHIP!

I could continue and get all discussion-y about this, but the point is that this show is about unite in differences and also lots and lots of hilarious moments. The show is just fun, it never to serious and it never to girly that it becomes alienating to males or females. This show has a huge fan base for a reason and it's because of the message that the show gives us. It really is something that you need to see for yourself in order to understand why this show is so special. (So buy the DVD! Ha ha ha I'm clever! ^-^)",1354838400,,1573,4.25752508361204

5275332,5,B0096W47NO,"I'm not going to waste time talking about the show. If you want to know what it's about, read any of the other 80+ reviews lavishing praise on the series, or, better yet, record a few episodes from the Hub on your DVR or Tivo. I'm going to discuss the stuff people reading these reviews actually care about: picture/sound quality, packaging, and extras.

Picture/Sound Quality = This set looks as good as any of the other MLP:FiM DVDs released by Shout! Factory. Really, this show can only look so good on DVD. The picture quality is great for a Flash-animated show on DVD, but it won't look great if you're used to the 1080p iTunes releases of the episodes.

Packaging = This set contains four DVDs in one case. Each disc is well-protected and easy to access. The art on the front and back of the case is pretty good. I'm less thrilled with the illustrations on the third and fourth discs (third disc has an illustration of Princess Cadance, a character not introduced until the Season Two finale! while the fourth disc has a questionably illustrated Princess Celestia). This is all nit-picking, though. Everything is bright and colorful. The case comes with a slip-cover illustrated the same as the case. The case itself is see-through, and the opposite side of the paper with the cover art displays a very pretty layout of various characters walking around Ponyville while also listing the various episodes in the set.

Extras = I counted six episodes with full commentary tracks (Friendship is Magic parts 1 and 2, Winter Wrap-Up, Suited for Success, The Show Stoppers, and The Best Night Ever). Commentators for these episodes include a couple of Hasbro execs, Jayson Thiessen, James Wootton, Nicole Oliver, Cathy Weseluck, Andrea Libman, Tabitha St. Germain, and Daniel Ingram. The commentators have a lot of fun talking about these episodes, although, far and away, my favorite commentary so far is the one for ""Suited for Success,"" in which Daniel Ingram talks quite a bit about the difficulties in finalizing the songs in that episode. There's nothing mind-blowing in these commentaries, but it is fun to hear Ingram talk about the music and the voice actors talk about the various characters.

Beyond the commentaries, there are short ""Pony Profiles"" in which the Mane Six are briefly introduced, downloadable coloring sheets, and two sing-a-longs (for the extended version of the title theme and At the Gala, respectively). These are mainly for children, but the sing-a-longs are definitely cute.

All-in-all, this is a solid set, and well worth investing in if you want to support the show's official release. Let's buy enough of these that Shout! Factory releases high quality Blu-Rays of these eps.",1354665600,40,2712,4.951648351648352

The case is the width of your standard single DVD case, with all four discs easily flipped through (none of those ""slim"" cases within a larger case). Only down side is that it has one of those paper sleeves that serve no purpose other than tear and get thrown away later. My children both love the two included sing-alongs and cute bits about the ponies. We're a little disappointed that the coloring sheets didn't include Fluttershy. We were pleased that they were just copy/paste PDFs from the disc, no extra agreements or licencing craziness. Can't wait for Season 2 and more!",1354665600,,618,4.731481481481482

5275353,5,B0096W47NO,"Ok. I have to admit, I'm a 52 year old brony....AND PROUD OF IT!!
I first found this show last year during the holidays, as I was looking for something new to watch.
I love cartoons, but most that I've seen in the last 10 years or so are....well....crap!
When I first saw the name ""My Little Pony,"" I thought it was going to be videos of that lame one from the 80's, that I'd skip past as fast as I could, when changing channels to find other cartoons on Saturday morning.
But I also noticed the other part of the title: ""Friendship Is Magic."" ""Hmmmm"" I thought, ""Maybe this is different."" What I found, surprised the heck out of me!
After downloading and watching the first 2 episodes, I started grabbing more, and more, and more, until I had all of the episodes available at the time (about 12 I think).
I thought, ""What a wonderful little show."" Yes, it's a show for young girls (about 7 to 12). But it's also got enough good stuff in it, that whether you're 7 or 70, you'll enjoy it.
Each pony has her own personality. Each has her own strengths and weaknesses. Each can be brave 1 moment, and afraid the next. And at the end of each episode, someone has learned something about friendship that makes them better.
Each episode of season 1 seems to get better and better as it goes on. Not that there are any bad ones.
Season 2, which hasn't hit DVD yet, and should, has some really great stuff in it. John de Lancie (Q from Star Trek TNG and Uncle Sid from Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda) has a part in the first 2 episodes of season 2. And he plays it to the hilt! He'll make you think he's a cartoon version of Q.
In another episode, they kind of parody a scene of Lucille Ball, from her chocolate factory episode, from the old I Love Lucy series. They even create a parody of of Julia Child, and give her the name of Mulia Mild (a mule of course). Both seasons have some pretty wacky episodes in them. But all have wonderful lessons in them too, which both adults and children can learn from.
So if that doesn't get you interested in seeing what the show is about, nothing will.
It converted me from the first moment I watched it. It's great to have something that men, women or children can watch, and not be turned off. I'm eagerly awaiting season 3's first episodes on November 10th.
So, when I have the money, I'll be buying this. I want to support it, and you should too. If I could rate this with more the 5 stars, I certainly would!",1351728000,4,2444,4.269396551724138
5275354,5,B0096W47NO,"This will be a review on the quality and features of the set, not a review of the show.

1. Quality

The quality is perfect. Yeah it's only on dvd but it's flawless. Don't worry about Hasbro trying to be cheap and making it bad quality to try to make a quick buck. It's fine.

2. Packaging

There are four discs. They come in a single case. They're held in two plastic flaps. Disc 1 & 2 in one on either side and Disc 3 & 4 in the other. They're not flimsy and you can pull them off if you want.

3. Features

There IS audio commentary on this. Not every episode but there's 26 episodes, you can't expect commentary on each one. The episodes that do have it are:

Friendship is Magic - Part 1 & 2. (pilot episodes with Nightmare Moon)

Winter Wrap-Up

Suited for Success

The Show Stoppers

The Best Night Ever

The people doing the commentary on all of them are:

Brian Lennard (Executive Producer at Hasbro)

Robert Fukes (Works at Hasbro)

Jason Thieesen (Supervising Director)

Nicole Oliver (Celestia/ Cherilee)

Kathy Weseluck (Spike/ The Mayor)

Andrea Libman (Pinkie Pie/ Fluttershy)

Tabitha St. Germain (Rarity/ Luna/ Nightmare Moon)

Those are the ones that are always there. Later, they're joined by:

Ridd Sorensen (Art Director)

Wootie (Director)

Daniel Ingram (Song Writer)

Sadly, Tara Strong (Twilight Sparkle) and Ashleigh Ball (Rainbow Dash/ AppleJacxk) aren't in it.  :(

The commentary is very funny and you learn a lot about the show. They talk about how it's reached more than the original target audience and even mention bro-hoof when Sweetie Belle, Scootaloo and Apple Bloom high five each other. Speaking of those three, I found out they're actually voiced by real children. I don't know how many other people knew that but it was the first time I learned about it  D:

Besides being funny and interesting, the commentary is also Hasbro acknowledging the brony fanbase again. Because honestly, what little girl do you know of that's going to want to listen to commentary for my little pony?

""Daddy, why are there people talking? I can't hear the ponies.""

""It's commentary dear, you learn things about it and-""

""I don't want to learn! I want to watch ponies!""

Yeah, I don't think so. No, Hasbro know they have a large adult fanbase and are respecting and acknowledging it (again)

The other special features are downloadable coloring books, profile videos for Twilight, Rarity, Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie and Princess Celestia (though for some strange reason Rainbow Dash wasn't included) and sing-alongs for the intro and At The Gala. The intro is the complete version, meaning there are a lot more lyrics and they talk about the Mane 6. Plus, it has a video to go along with the lyrics, not the intro video you're probably thinking of. The same thing is also on the Friendship Express DVD.

So yeah, it's well worth your money if you like this show. Like another reviewer said: (not a direct quote) ""it doesn't matter if you can get the episodes another way, buying this shows support, so then we might get seasons 2 and 3 boxsets""

I actually have every episode on my Ps3 already and I still bought this.

At first when i heard about My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic i immediately thought of the older generations like the 1984 version and thought no I'm not going to watch it but then when one of my good friends told me ""just give it a try"" i agreed and watched it (my first episode was family appreciation day i believe) after that i was instantly hooked on the show It has parts that are for little kids but it also has some hidden adult humor that the older crowd will enjoy I'm not going to lie to you i can't get enough of the show. whenever it's on i drop what I'm doing to watch it :)",1348531200,,649,4.0
5275367,5,B0096W47NO,"Alrighty, I am pretty stoked about this. I had reservations about this show after reading about the brony phenomenon on the internet and seeing a few, now obviously skewed, tv spots about it. Being a fan of most animation and willing to watch a few episodes of any series at least once I gave it a spin one weekend. It was much better than I had anticipated. The characters have depth and well presented distinct personalities. And if you watch out for them, culture references abound as well.  After researching a small bit and finding that it was Lauren Faust who put this version together I knew why it was so good, as Powerpuff Girls and Foster's Home immediately came to mind. Now, I remember the original version from the 80's. I didn't watch it as I was too busy watching He-Man and Transformers and building forts in the woods in those days. But the flow of the show and the morality tales that are included at the end of each episode give it a bit of a nostalgic feel for me which I enjoy and admittedly is what hooked me most. I will look forward to the commentaries on this and hopefully a blu-ray release, or at least a season two release coming soon. This is, by far, one of the best cartoons on television at the moment.",1348444800,,1234,4.388646288209607

Well, turns out that one day when I was home sick and bored I stumbled across the first episode of MLP online and watched it to see what the fuss was about.

A week and 26 episodes later, I can't stop watching it and I'm not sure why... the animation style or the music or the storylines that everyone can relate to. And of course a whole bunch of cute ponies that can brighten anyone's day. And this is coming from a fan of shooter games and horror movies. Well consider me a convert to the brony religion and everyone who loves the show should pre-order this box set and enjoy it all again (and again).

Fortunately, I overcame my initial reluctance. And whilst the opening song didn't exactly blow me away, it was more the characters that truly gripped me. As an autistic, I can see that each of the characters represent the good and bad sides of autism and as such, I connected. But especially with Twilight Sparkle.

An intelligent but socially isolated unicorn, set apart by circumstances beyond her control.

I'm fairly sure we can all relate in part to that.

I wanted to know what all the fuss was about, so I forced myself to sit down and watch the first episode on YouTube...then the second...and third...and before long, I'd devoured seasons 1 and 2 and was left waiting eagerly for the third.

At its most basic level, yes, MLPFIM is a kids' show. At the same time, though, it's very smart and surprisingly deep. The main characters in particular are refreshingly complex and well-developed. The writing is intelligent, the voice acting superb, the music catchy, and the animation excellent.

Millions have given ponies a chance, and millions have found something they love. This show, which, by the way, has some of the biggest and most talented names in the animation business behind it, has inspired art among its fans and fostered a community centered on love and tolerance. In the brony community, it's strikingly common to hear about how My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic helped someone through depression or hardship, and its online communities are becoming well known as a place you can go if you need someone to listen.
If the credentials of the community aren't what you're looking for, then look no further than the fact that Lauren Faust of ""The Powerpuff Girls"" and ""Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends"" developed this impressive animated series, and it features the voice talent of Tara Strong, a well known veteran. The animation is fun and colorful, carefully and lovingly crafted; the music is creative and catchy; and the humor, while appropriate for children, is also appealing for adults, containing amusing references to literature and mythology.
Plainly, whether you're talking about the show or the loving community it's fostered, My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic has made people happy. Give it a try if you're a lover of fine animation, or just looking for some cheer.",1347235200,3,1408,4.920168067226891

So, why is a man like me going crazy over a cartoon about pretty ponies? You probably think that I escaped from the looney bin. Actually, that's not it. You see, I love cartoons. Always have, always will. I love cartoons going way back to Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse cartoons.

As a cartoon lover, I feel that animation has taken a nose dive in the past decade. It seems that everything that made cartoons good in the old days just isn't there anymore. However, heres a cartoon that changes all of that. Don't let the ""My Little Pony"" name fool you. This show isn't the same '80s cartoon that feel like thirty minute long toy commercials for girls. This cartoon is actually... Well, a cartoon. The characters have depth and interesting personalities. The humor is well written, and has jokes that little kids wouldn't understand. The plots have conflicts that aren't always the easiest for the characters to fix. This is no kids show. This show is made to appeal to us, adults. It's a cartoon that you can watch with little kids and not want to shoot yourself. I hold is special because I've never seen any cartoon that's come this close to being just like the golden age cartoons. It's got everything:

The wacky humor of ""Looney Tunes.""
The colorful animation of Disney.

It's got everything I want from a cartoon, and more.

5275447,5,B0096W47NO,"Any child of the 80s or even the 90s, could tell you that My Little Pony was a cartoon show originally created to sell pony toys to little girls, much in the same way Transformers was a show created to sell toy robots to little boys. Typically you would not think much of either series, you'd look down you nose at them, and assume they were just shallow 22 minute toy commercials. My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, defies all expectation. It provides surprisingly well developed characters, each of whom have flaws they have to deal with, and plots that teach genuine and worthwhile life lessons, that has been sorely lacking from most children's television since Hey Arnold ended. The best part is that never once does the show look down upon its intended audience of young girls, it assumes they are intelligent, and alert enough to digest and understand the more meaningful things going on, and the show is all the better off for it.

Now for its unintended of audience of young adults around the ages of 18 and above (my self included). The reason this show connects with so many older people (inaddition to the children), is again, because of the intelligently written and surprisingly deep characters. Each of the main 6 characters that the show centers around, are based on one, or a small number of archetypal character types.  You have the dutiful, perfection seeking student, the tough hardworking farmer, the sometimes arrogant, but loyal athlete, the fame seeking fashion diva with a generous heart, the shy but infinitely kind, lover of nature, and the always hyper, fun loving party thrower. The broad range of characters, allows almost anyone to connect and empathize with the characters, as they can see them a bit of themselves in one or more of the characters. But what really takes this show over the edge, and makes it way more then just ""girly"" cartoon, is that it takes that the foundation of fantastic characters, and throws in some of the best humor seen in animation, since Disney classics like The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladin. A character will do something you never saw coming, and then you laugh your head off because you say to yourself ""Well of course they did that hilarious thing, its totally what that character would do.""

As a great man playing a terrifying character in a film once said ""You've changed things, forever, there is no going back""

My Litte Pony: Friendships is Magic has forever changed the rules of ""children's"" cartoons, and regardless of how long the show itself continues on, the fact that it effortlessly entranced both its target audience, and its unintended audience of young and older adults, means that it will forever change the way the big companies think about they way they make entertainment, and undoubtedly improve the quality of ""children's"" animation.",1347062400,81,2859,4.852459016393443

For example, in just about any other show, Rarity would be a stereotypical girly-girl, obsessed with boys, shopping, and hair.  Here, she's certainly a fashionista, but she's also a competent businesswoman, something of an artist, and knows how to handle herself in dangerous situations. All the cast members have a similar level of development, which lends itself really well to the slice-of-life nature of the show.

- The character designs and animation are great.  It's cute and endearing, but not to the tooth-rot degree of previous generations, and it's still good for the occasional action sequence.  As a bonus it's very expressive and surprisingly detailed for a flash-based cartoon.

- Ditto for the music; it doesn't necessarily stick out, but it definitely enhances the show as a whole.

- Good writing: On the whole, the show avoids most of the pitfalls of kid shows by using lots of character-based humor and self-awareness that can appeal to viewers of any age and rarely feels patronizing towards the adult audience.  You don't need to be a kid to find it funny.  At the same time, the plots are generally executed well enough that they don't feel like rehashes of common plotlines, and even when the plots are quite simple they're still entertaining due to the charm that the characters bring to everything.

- Good Acting: There's some serious voice talent here; Tara Strong (Twilight Sparkle) is basically the patron saint of voice acting, Andrea Libman displays some impressive range (voicing both Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie, two characters who have almost opposite personalities), Ashleigh Ball gives Rainbow Dash and Applejack very distinct voices, and Tabitha St. Germain does a great of job making Rarity into an entertaining and balanced character.

This isn't to say that Season 1 is totally without fault; like all things, it has a few rough spots (In particular, the Cutie Mark Crusader based episodes can seem a bit same-y due to the characters having the same motivation in each), but overall it's consistently high quality and well worth checking out, even if you aren't a kid.  I've found that it has a degree of quality and subtlety that sets it apart from a lot of other children's programming.

EDIT: Now that I have the DVD, I'm just going to throw in a few comments about the physical media aspects. I haven't had time to watch everything yet, but I've watched a few episodes worth on the various discs and they look good so far.

1. The commentaries are very entertaining and interesting.  They aren't particularly ground-breaking, but it's fun to hear about some of the behind-the-scenes stuff from the show's staff.  There's a good selection of people from actors, to writers, to producers, and they definitely offer some interesting insights into the show.

2. The audio and video quality are great.  It's not hi-def, but it's still perfectly good quality that really demonstrates the skill of animators and composers.

3. The physical DVD box itself is sturdy, if without frills.

The only things I can really complain about are rather insubstantial, but in the interest of fairness I'll include them anyway:

1. The box artwork.  They use some of the same stock vectors that they use for 90% of the merchandise, which isn't bad in and of itself, but having seen it everywhere else it feels a bit lazy when it would have been fairly easy to use something new.  Also, one of the DVD's has an image of Princess Cadance, who doesn't actually appear in the series until the end of the second season.  It doesn't bug me, but I guess a kid could get confused wondering who the pink pony on the DVD is.

2. The menu music. It's a loop of the ""My Little Pony"" line from the show's theme song, and if you listen to it for more than about 20 seconds it starts to get a bit annoying.  Again, an extremely minor issue, but one that could have been really easily solved by just sticking in some of the show's (excellent) BGM instead of a 10-second loop.

So basically, the show itself is awesome, the DVDs maintain the quality, and the only issues are so insubstantial that they're barely worth mentioning.  They certainly aren't important enough to knock any stars off the rating.  If you were on the fence about buying the DVD, do it, it's completely worth it.

(Note: I haven't checked out all the special features, like the coloring pages and whatnot on the fourth disc, but I doubt those will really factor much into the rating either)",1346976000,54,4797,4.8134146341463415
5275464,5,B0096W47NO,"This is something that Hasbro finally pulled out thats been in demand by the fans for well over a year. Long awaited and I assure it will be eagerly purchased and owned, even exceeding Hasbro's expectations. Most of the time companies like Hasbro put out 4 episode DVDs, very rarely complete seasons.

But not this time, the fans, better known as Bronies, have verbally and loudly let Hasbro know that there is a demand for the full season. And this time they wisely listened. Though I certainly hope that soon put out Season 2 as well on DVD.

The beauty of this series unlike the earlier variants of MLP. There are no annoying little human girls involved, excellent writing, enjoyable characters, decent animation, especially for flash animation. Its not ""Giggle Giggle, lets have a tea party, Giggle Giggle, lets play dress up!"" like the previous incarnations were. But real scenarios and situations that people actually face. As an adult I too once balked at this show initially, having horrid nightmares of the previous ""Hippos with elephantiasis legs"", the Ponies (albeit they have tiny muzzles) are actually likable. I didn't the urge to put a brick through the TV. And can watch the show with my daughter without feeling my brain melt out my ears.",1346976000,6,1255,4.859813084112149
5275465,5,B0096W47NO,"Okay, I know many pony fans really would love the awesomeness to be on a bluray disc instead of DVDs, buy this anyway. We need to show that their is a market for these box sets. You all should know that it's a business and they look for sale numbers. Think about this purchase as investing in potentially more awesomeness in the future. Think bluray with more special features!

Let Hasbro know that adult fan base is relevant and that the show is well worth their time in continuing, so that we can have more pony seasons!

Edit:

Got my Season 1 4 Disc Set in the Mail today December 4, 2012. Its not cheaply made or anything, its even got a inside cover and lots of commentary! Here is hoping that Season 2 will get the same treatment.",1346976000,9,738,4.294964028776978

Definitely support this release,it is clearly targeted for Bronies being an exclusive like this and the alleged bonus content like audio commentary with the cast and crew. Supporting this will surely lead to more DVD releases, perhaps even Blu-ray!",1346976000,112,351,4.866666666666666
5275467,5,B0096W47NO,"Even though Season 1 and 2 are on Netflix, this is still a good deal because of the special features.  Furthermore, if this sells well, then that means they would be willing to take risks on us with more specials.  Hasbro wants to see if we are a viable and reliable market. This could lead to season 2, Blu-ray, more interviews & special features catered to Bronies, maybe even shorts and mini-episodes.  I'd definitely pay for a DVD of never-before-seen 5 or 10-minute shorts. So, buy the box set!  Pre-order it while the price is a literal steal!
