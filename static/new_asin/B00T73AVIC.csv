7002478,4,B00T73AVIC,"I am one of the most fanatic dynasty fans as i grew up with the series during the 80s as a teen and i never missed an episode each week until the show was canselled in 1989.
 In my country the reunion 1991 series was broadcasted BUT the spin off series of the colbys never did so i waited for a dvd release to come but years passed by and i was giving up all hope until suddenly i saw it's coming out as a complete series..
 I saw the series 10 years ago but only in bootleg dvd's
 Finally i will be able to see the new dynasty adventures of jason colby's family. IN OFFICIAL HIGH QUALITY DVD'S AT LAST.
 The colbys were introdused in dynasty's 6th season after episode 2 when the carringtons returned safe home from the moldavian massacre and they were participated at least in 3 dynasty's episodes in early season 6 with the most memorable of them to be called......THE TITANS.
 A superb cast starring heston, stanwick, beacham (who also appeared in dynasty) and others joined with jeff and fallon this series u will love if u loved dynasty.
 Same formula and many returning dynasty characters like riccardo montalvan and d. carroll made the show special.
 SABLE COLBY is even a more witched character than alexis was and i see the series as a real dynasty continuation although joan collins refused to appear in the series as she saw dynasty declining from 1986 and on.

 This is a great buy as the set has also EXTRA FEATURES only included in this set including new interviews from JOHN JAMES // M. CAULFIELD and STEPHANIE BEACHAM.

 I give this 4 stars only cause it's OVER PRISED.

 since when 2 seasons costs.......$120.00  ?

 I hope amazon will fix the prise so that more fans can buy this underrated 80's drama which unfortunately failed at ratings AS IT 's first season was out of nielsen's top 30 and the 2nd season was out of top 70 and so the show was canselled after season 2 but it's a must have FOR THE REAL DYNASTY FANS.....(highest rating episode was fallon's wedding episode at # 19)

 ALL POP UP THE SAMPAGNE AND HAIL DYNASTY II , THE COLBYS (this title appeared in First 4 episodes only) ON OFFICIAL DVD FOR FIRST TIME // YEA HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

 PS.

 Now we wait for the dynasty reunion 1991 to be released plus the dynasty E true hollywood story and the 2006 chaviar re-union show.",1423180800,18,2313,4.470167064439141
7002479,5,B00T73AVIC,"In 1985 ABC's ""Dynasty"" became the #1 series on American television. So, it was no great surprise that the network wanted to cash in on the Prime Time Soap Era that existed in the 1980's by creating a spin-off of ""Dynasty"" called ""The Colbys"" (originally the working title was ""Dynasty II- The Colbys""). The series was also created in order to get Pamela Sue Martin back as Fallon Carrington who had quit ""Dynasty"" in 1984. The reasoning was that if Fallon came back she would head the new serial while also making appearances on ""Dynasty"". Sadly, Pamela declined the offer so Emma Samms (fresh from ""General Hospital"") came in to fill the part (to me one of the worst casting decisions ever made although I love Emma).

 In the spring of 1985 while ""Dynasty"" was at its height in popularity Fallon showed up in Los Angeles with amnesia and had no recollection of who she was. A young handsome man named Miles Colby found her and fell in love with her. Then the story began.

 The Colbys were first introduced on ""Dynasty"" in November, 1985 in a two hour episode called ""The Colbys of California"". They had everything the Carringtons had, but more. Jason Colby (Charlton Heston) headed the family and was the brother to Constance Colby (Barbara Stanwyck's last role before her death). Jason was married to the beautiful Sable (Scott) Colby who was Alexis Carrington's first cousin (Sable once quppied to Alexis; ""You know darling our Mommies were sistas!). Jason and Sable had three children Myles, Monica and Bliss.

 The acting was top notch all the way, the sets were breath taking (the Colby Mansion exteriors were actually the same house in Brentwood where ""Mommie Dearest"" was filmed) and the story lines strong and involving ( the series really reminded me of the second season of ""Dynasty"" when you couldn't miss an episode). The series also had its really high moments, almost all of them involving the wonderful Stephanie Beecham as Sable. In one episode she told her husband what she thought of her sister Frankie (Katherine Ross); ""Trust Frankie, that tramp, that slut!"" and to her sister's face about her sister's son; ""I don't give a damn about your bastard you little slut!""

 In this exquisite box set all 49 episodes from ""The Colbys"" two season run on ABC (1985-1987) are included uncut and cleaned from their masters and there will be new interviews with John James (Jeff), Max Caulfield (Myles) and Stephanie Beecham (Sable).

 For true soap opera fans and historians this set is a real treat when one considers that more popular prime time soaps like ""Knots Landing, ""Flamingo Road"" and ""Falcon's Crest"" are far away from having their entire library of seasons put on DVD for posterity. Luckily for us now we will always have ""The Colbys"" to enjoy! Pop the wine, bring out the crackers and cheese and sit back and see a true dynasty bicker, fight, tear each other apart, sleeping on one another, shooting people and even boarding a ...( I can't tell you the last word!)",1423094400,40,2990,4.7771317829457365

People need to remember this show was from the 1980's so there may be some slight imperfections that you would not find in a television show from 2016.  Also, there is not the same level of political correctness that you would find in a show from 2016.  While I agree with everyone that Stephanie is an incredible actress, I disagree with most of the posters' opinions of Sable.  Sable's greediness was cause of the divorce not Frankie.  Sable was jealous that her sister's son was given Connie's inheritance, so she tried to have Connie, her husband's sister, declared mentally incompetent.",1471478400,,665,4.689655172413793

7002498,4,B00T73AVIC,"As a fan of Dynasty, I became equally turned on to The Colbys. It was somewhat a staple of the 80s for TV networks to duplicate the success of other networks while retaining innovation and individuality. Keep in mind, in the 80s there were only the TV networks CBS, ABC, and NBC for those persons who didn't have Cable TV. ABC was home to many shows from producer Aaron Spelling, and The Colbys was a new gem and spinoff of Dynasty. The Colbys (particularly) continued the 80s tradition of exhibiting how money doesn't solve rich people's problems, despite their glamour, passion, and wealth. It was a joy to have a cast anchored by the incredible screen legends Charlton Heston, Barbara Stanwyck, and Ricardo Montalban. Additionally, I grew to love the beautiful and talented Stephanie Beacham and Tracy Scoggins. Stephanie (Sable Colby) particularly became a favorite in that while she wasn't as treacherous as her cousin Alexis on Dynasty, she nevertheless did whatever she could to hold her family together without trying to control her children. This was a notable difference in the shows in my opinion.

The series earned a People's Choice Award after its 1st season. Unfortunately, it was cancelled after 2 seasons; my only criticism about the series was the last episode. I won't spoil it here. Instead, I encourage you to watch this great series.",1450742400,7,1355,4.942982456140351

7002505,5,B00T73AVIC,What is not to love?!???  The entire series of the Colby's on DVD!  This series was just as good as Dynasty and cancelled way to soon.  If ABC had given this o e more season I think it would have caught on with more viewers.  The second season finale was way ahead of its time....when Fallon is kidnapped in the UFO everyone laughed at it...but it wasn't long after that the X Files premiered and everyone accepted UFO abductions on TV shows!  A must for any fan of Dynasty and The Colby's!!!!!!,1443484800,8,495,4.336956521739131
7002506,5,B00T73AVIC,I am so happy to have been able to but the complete seasons of the Colbys. I love how the story evolved and went in a direction all it's own. I enjoyed the sloppyiness on Dynasty which had me coming back for another look a this family. With the Colbys that continued with the messy relationships and the truth about how every character is connected. Sable Colby was my favorite even though she had issues she was still family orientated which made me as the audience sympathetic towards her character. The only person that they could have left out of the clan was the younger daughter. I grew to love Monica and it took me for a loop when the end of the first season left me hanging. I will watch the second season next year even thought the temptation to watch it now is overwhelming. If you liked Dynasty then the Colbys is the icing on top of the cake.,1442793600,2,855,4.316770186335404

7002509,2,B00T73AVIC,"I was a rabid Dynasty fan during Seasons 1 - 4. When Pamela Sue Martin quit the show, I lost interest and was later chased away from the show by the dopey Season 6 storylines (fake Krystle, Alexis and King Galen, etc.). I never watched The Colbys, so I bought this on a lark to see the complete Dynasty universe. However, even as a Dynasty fan, I can see why this show was a dismal ratings failure.

The Good:
- Charlton Heston may be a ham, but hes excellent as patriarch Jason Colby. Totally exudes alpha male, yet he brings nuance to the role especially in his scenes with Francesca. You can tell hes just expiring with love even when he says nothing at all.
- Barbara Stanwyck is a firecracker as Constance Colby. Smart, decent, but nobodys fool. Who wouldnt want to have an Aunt Connie in their corner? Unfortunately, Stanwyck (wisely) bailed after Season 1.
- Ricardo Montalban steals almost every scene hes in with his suave Wrath of Khan vibe. His Zach Powers should be the primary villain, but the writers just have him idle around. He menaces but never does much actual damage.
- Overall, there is just enough of the flavor of Dynasty to appeal to a fan.

The Couldve Been Good:
- Jeff (John James) should be the main character of The Colbys and our guide into this new family, just like Krystle (Linda Evans) was in the first two seasons of Dynasty. However, the tension created by Jeff's arrival is quickly resolved and he isn't given much to do. Big miss.
- As Miles, Maxwell Caulfield creates a character with presence and energy, but his effectiveness is often undermined by his slender acting ability.
- Sable should be deliciously wicked, but the writers never decide what to do with her. Is she a villain or a doormat? Her machinations always blow up in her face like shes Lucy Ricardo, and Stephanie Beechams pose-y acting is a liability.
- Tracy Shoulda-Been-Cast-As-Fallon Scoggins is compelling as Monica, but in Season 1 shes mostly relegated to useless storylines in which she blathers about feminism. Fortunately, shes given much better material in Season 2. She has great chemistry with every actor she plays against, but I really loved her scenes with Heston.
- The Hoyt Parker storyline. Big build up to a shocking reveal that then goesnowhere.

The Ugly and Offensive:
- All female characters not listed above. In Seasons 1-4 of Dynasty, the women are powerful, intelligent, and not defined by the men in their lives. In The Colbysits totally the opposite. Francesca, Fallon, Channing, Adrienne and Bliss are characters defined by their uterus. None of them have any purpose except to be over-emotional romantic partners and/or to navigate their ability/inability to be vessels of childbearing. The worst two examples deserve especial attention:
- Fallon (Emma Samms). In Dynasty, Pamela Sue Martin invested Fallon with spirit, humor and intelligence. On the Colbys, Fallons written as a blubbering victim with a big rack. She cries or is about to cry in about 75% of the scenes shes in. The rest of the time she nags Jeff or is mentally unstable. Even if Fallon had been written well, its unlikely Samms could have done the role justice. As an actress, she has two facial expressions: straight hair and curly hair.
- Francesca (Katherine Ross). A three-car pile-up of Ross narcoleptic acting, bad dialogue, and a non-entity of a character. Francesca has powerful men falling over themselves to marry her, yet she has the allure of a mud puddle. Shes a poor mother, mousy, indecisive, purposeless, and falls into bed - and therefore, of course, into love - with any man the forced storylines need her to be with. In Francesca, Ross and the writers have achieved the unprecedented feat of creating a woman that is at once promiscuous and frigid. How anyone can watch this annoying character and not be disgusted is beyond me, and yet we are (apparently) supposed to view Francesca as the heroine of the show. Utterly bizarre.

The Colbys fails as a prime-time soap because it lacks the subversive edge, wicked humor, cutting dialogue and nuanced plotlines that Dynasty or Dallas originally brought to the soap genre. Instead The Colbys is written like a daytime soap. Its a fun time-waster if you're a Dynasty fan, but for anyone else its a sawdust cake slathered with a turpentine frosting of plotlines that all take 49 episodes to go nowhere.",1441324800,17,4372,4.794429708222812
7002510,5,B00T73AVIC,"One of my favorite night time shows is given 5 star treatment by Shout Factory. The writing ranged from erratic to brilliant but as it went on, the show became better than the mother show, Dynasty. ABC clearly threw the show away by fiddling with its time slot. Any time it was scheduled after Dynasty- it raked in the ratings. Stephanie Beacham, Chuck Heston, Ricardo Montalban, Katherine Ross give powerhouse performances making the cancellation even more tragic. It will always be best known for its cliffhanger of Fallon sauntering aboard a UFO, but for fans it will be remembered for entertaining and poignant tv. A bonus? You can hit ""play all"" where Dynasty dvds do not allow for that.",1440806400,5,692,4.823529411764706

7002526,5,B00T73AVIC,"I was a die-hard fan of this series in the 80's. Watching it 30+ years later, is akin to time travel in the campiest sense. As for the DVD set itself, it failed expectations; no scene selections and no alternate language/caption options. It hasn't been digitized at all, so you see all of the ""specks"" as I call them, though the transfer is acceptable. The jewels sparkle, the flowers are in bloom and the sets look fabulous. I was disappointed that each episode doesn't end with the next weeks preview, as when originally aired. There are two interviews with Stephanie Beacham, Maxwell Caufield and John James, which were enlightening. I will give it credit when it comes to sound. The music, which is just as ultra dramatic as the series, is a joy to hear after all of these years, even if it's not Dolby 7.1.

The series itself ranges from totally awful in the first season to totally ridiculous and addictive melodrama by the second season. I will agree on what another reviewer stated, it should be renamed ""The Stephanie Beacham Show"". While the entire cast are beautiful and handsome, their acting abilities are sorely put to the test. Charlton Heston (Jason) and Barbara Stanwyck (Constance/Connie) are marginal at best. Katherine Ross (Francesca/Frankie) is totally lost and out of her element. Ricardo Montalban (Zack Powers) has much more of a redeeming character than I remembered, vengeful yet noble, and strangely reminiscent of Khan against Kirk, this time Powers against Colby. Emma Samms (Fallon), John James (Jeff), Maxwell Caulfield (Miles), Tracy Scoggins (Monica) and Claire Yarlett (Bliss) are just stunningly beautiful, with body curvatures and shots in swim wear and evening wear that even today, social media would go wild with. They are minor characters to Stephanie Beacham and if I may, the city of Los Angeles. Much to their credit, by the second season their acting improved, along with the scripts, in my opinion.

The scenes set then in mid-late 1980's Los Angeles add to the over-the-top acting; Lunch and dining scenes in Century City still holds up well. Their corporate helicopter flying above downtown LA or transporting the family from LAX to their private estate in Bel Air (I believe the exterior shots were of Barron Hilton's estate) or back to Colby Tower (then First Interstate Tower, now called AON Tower), their beach house in Malibu and constant court room action at the Los Angeles County Courthouse, validates this family DOES own this city, or at the very least, some choice property. The second season Cold War overtones are laughable amidst Sable's ""new dance company at the Colby Center"". The Soviet Union and Red Chinese references for a proposed international consortium building a space station are downright hilarious in 2015.

Now to Stephanie Beacham (Sabella ""Sable"" Scott Colby). It's her that makes this show. She is a caricature at times, bordering on a crazy diva fusion of Joan Crawford and her best motion picture wardrobe and temper, jewels Eva Peron would covet, a sublime beauty and glamour of Elizabeth Taylor and a British accent bordering on royalty. The quips and scripts are designed for her, ""I respect your politics, am quite fond of your beard but it's your relationship to Zack Powers I detest,"" or something to that effect (I would never try to quote her verbatim) are augmented by her gorgeous eyes and finger nails. You will believe she runs the largest private art gallery outside of Europe. You will believe she is a generous supporter of the fine arts, charities and other noble civic causes. You will be her ally against her sister and husband. You will believe ""Heav'n has no rage like love to hatred turn'd / Nor Hell a fury, like a woman scorn'd.""

In this age of instant fame through Twitter or Facebook, or mass social opinion fueled by the likes of the Kardashian's, the show echoes back to the decline of an era when our voyeuristic needs were met by television shows such as this. You'll never be able to go to a Silicon Valley or Wall Street executives office and pour scotch and determine your next takeover. No one serves champagne as a matter-of-fact, instead, you get bottled water or a Diet Coke. No one dresses for dinner at a restaurant, let alone with your family at home, with Asian and British servants waiting in the wings. Even my beloved home city of Dallas and related television series lacks the panache of Los Angeles, and The Colbys.

As someone in their mid-20's when this series was on the air, it compelled me to succeed. Now, in my mid 50's, watching it in my Four Seasons robe, sipping G. H. Mumm & Cie. - Cordon Rouge Brut, I feel young again. Who would have believed back then, I would be writing a review, on the internet, on Amazon, lamenting the final episode, about a fictional rich white girl, being taken away by a UFO?

They really don't make them like this anymore.",1431993600,44,4890,4.815476190476191
7002527,3,B00T73AVIC,"The show's enjoyable for the most part, although Maxwell Caulfield couldn't act his way out of a paper bag!  For the OUTRAGEOUS price they're charging, you'd think the transfer would be better.  I think it looks lousy and there's NO subtitles.  Very disappointing in that respect.  A bit of a rip off.  If you can wait, buy it used for a LOT less down the road.",1431561600,7,361,4.409090909090909
7002528,5,B00T73AVIC,Two reasons to watch the Colbys and they are Stephanie Beacham and Stephanie Beachams wardrobe both were equally awesome. It desperately wanted to be great but came to the table a bit late in the day for prime time soaps but its still fun with all the best one liners being delivered by Stephanie who conveys so much without saying a word by merely lifting an eyebrow or a menacing glare. The rest of them were purely window dressings with virtually nothing to do or say. The stories were repetitive and really quite lame with everything seemingly revolving within the immediate family without ever braching out very much. Watch out for the dreadful painting of a greek island (Corfu as far as i remember) which the Colby jet is meant to be passing over. The massive budget was clearly on SBs back and on the subject of budget this is massively overpriced; knock 50% off and they might be onto a winner,1431388800,6,902,4.574074074074074

7002531,5,B00T73AVIC,"There are no words to describe the level of excitement that I am experiencing right now. I was first introduced to The Colbys in 2010 when my obsession with Dynasty began in 2009. I was disappointed when I found out The Colbys wasn't available on DVD, but I knew there were bootleg copies of the series floating around on the internet. I understand the short-lived series received a lot of flack from critics, but I think The Colbys was a worthy companion to Dynasty. I'm genuinely happy to know one of my favourite shows is finally getting a release that it deserves. Thank you, Shout! Factory, for making this possible.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1428796800,2,642,4.732142857142857

7002533,5,B00T73AVIC,"Season 1 dovetails perfectly into Dynasty's season 6, while season 2 of The Colbys has less crossovers between characters, though it still occurs. Although this show never matches Dynasty's highs or humor, it's a must-have companion piece if only to see the awesome Stephanie Beacham, as Sable, steal scenes from Hollywood heavyweights like Charlton Heston and Barbara Stanwyck. Welcome back to the 80s...",1423699200,9,405,5.444444444444445

8700700,5,B00T73AVIC,"My favorite 80s show!  Love all the glamour, totally fun to watch. Wish it couldve lasted a few more seasons.",1519516800,,109,4.45
8700701,5,B00T73AVIC,"One of the greatest prime time soaps/dramas of all time. I really wish this show could have lasted longer than 2 seasons. I just finished the original Dallas a few months ago (It only took me about 4 years A BIG THANK YOU TO AMAZON PRIME). After watching Dynasty, Falcon Crest's first two season, and the reboot of Dallas, I really fell in love with this show. I love the opening theme and the location shoots. It is high hair, big shoulder pads, and diva deliciousness. I am thankful that Sable eventually came over to Dynasty for its final season (which also was starting to really get good again before being cancelled sadly) if only Dominque wasn't cut from the final season of Dynasty it would have been perfect. Ok enough about Dynasty- this is the Colby's which in my and many other opinions is far better than Dynasty. Enjoy!",1510617600,,833,4.56

8700703,5,B00T73AVIC,"I'm currently in the middle of watching Season 1 of The Colbys, along with Season 6 of Dynasty (they aired during the same time period). Im enjoying both, but could it be The Colbys is the better show? It certainly has something Dynasty never had in its main cast: former A-list actors.

Its good seeing Charlton Heston again. He was 62 years old at the time, and I suspect what we see on his head isn't quite all of his God-Given hair. Barbara Stanwyck is really old, and wasn't happy with the way things were going, and so she left after the first season. The character of Sable is something else and often makes Alexis seem tame in comparison.

I like Emma Samms (General Hospital) as Fallon. Shes a more subdued and softer version, and even though shes no longer sexually promiscuous, that doesnt stop men being attracted to her and the poor lady is often taken by force.

I didn't see a lot of these shows during their original run, so it's good watching them without missing anything. Too bad it was cancelled!

8700704,4,B00T73AVIC,"Set in the extravagant eighties The Colbys feature a billionaire multi-national businessman and his family  Everything that people love and hate about that decade is shown in this series. This series is worth watching if for nothing more than the fashions, the big hair on the women, the exquisite jewels and the fabulously manicured claw length fingernails of the women. The characters are complex enough that you have to sort out for yourself who is the villain and who is the good guy(or woman).  I suspect each viewer will have a different opinion of which is which.

Technically, the DVDs are a little lacking in quality, especially in that they have frequent blackouts. Not for a long period of time, but enough to interrupt the flow of the scene and enough that you miss a line of dialog. If you are prepared for that, and are looking for a bit of fun, settle in and enjoy the ride.",1503360000,,889,4.613924050632911
