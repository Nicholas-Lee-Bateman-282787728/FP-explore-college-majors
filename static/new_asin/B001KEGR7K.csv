8314646,5,B001KEGR7K,Great Adventure documentary DVD.,1413849600,,32,7.25
8314647,5,B001KEGR7K,"These guys are great at what they do.  I wish they made more than the three videos (Mek, Kombai, and Machigenga).  You'll fall in love with the characters and see proof that humans were made to live in harmony with nature.  These guys, the Mek, in some ways, are much more brilliant than we are.  Obviously, they don't have real healthcare, meds, or ANY technology more than wood and nature but that's the cool thing about them.  Mark and Olly are so respectful to the people and the Mek take them in and make eventually treat them like brothers(but first as their children!).",1406764800,,576,4.553398058252427
8314648,5,B001KEGR7K,It is very good to have this kind of documentary. We can see how hard they make the film. I love them all.,1402531200,,106,3.652173913043478
8314649,1,B001KEGR7K,Seriously this is the most baffling thing. If you show something on here at least make it available to view.,1381190400,2,108,4.45
8314650,4,B001KEGR7K,"One of the most interesting films I have seen about tribal life, extreme trekking to find the elusive Kombai Tribe in the southern swamps of West Papua.  Places where western men have never walked.  Taking thier lives in danger, approaching tribes that have never laid eyes on a white man.  I found it fascinating.",1318636800,,314,4.777777777777778
8314651,5,B001KEGR7K,"This is a captivating anthropological and adventure series of the way of life in a hunter-gatherer society, the Mek Tribe. It's fascinating to take a peek at how humans act and live while shunning contemporary life. The show does appear to be scripted at times due to the editing; I later found out that it had to be done due to translation issues.

Some may say that it is unethical for cameras and Western people to intrude their way of life, but the Kombai Tribe welcomed Olly and Mark and the production staff with welcome arms; perhaps we can learn something from the tribe. If you are sensitive about nudity, look elsewhere, as the tribe dons grass skirts and most of the men wear gourds on their privates.  This is an educational and entertaining series.",1268438400,,761,4.62962962962963
8314652,5,B001KEGR7K,"I loved this series and have watched it many times.  The copy first sent to me was defective in that one of the tracks would simply not play.  I contacted Amazon and within a day got a response with a printable return label and notice that a new copy was on the way.

This is the way to keep business.  Way to go Amazon!  You have a customer for life and I would and do recommend you to everyone.  Thanks again!",1265932800,,411,4.012345679012346
8314653,5,B001KEGR7K,"Another good show of ""living with the..."", but you have to be the trpe of person that likes to see different life styles and culture to be able to enjoy it.

I do wonder why it is this short, no it isn't that short, but when it is filmed over 40 days as I seem to remember, I think there could be a lot more shown which isn't and more shown on the interviews, but ow well very good.",1237420800,3,382,3.8354430379746836
8314654,5,B001KEGR7K,"We absolutely love this show, and the other tribes Mark and Olly visted before(Kombai Tribe) and after, the newest one currently on the travel channel: Mark & Olly: Machigenga Tribe.

 Believe me, I watch the all the popular shows like Lost and Prison Break, and this is just as riveting. On top of that, you learn a lot. It's fascinating to see how these tribes survive and their way of life. Mark and Olly always try their hardest and its so funny to watch the women in the tribe make fun of them for not being good at things like building huts, hunting or finding grubs to eat. It might sound boring, but it is by far one of our favorite shows. Definitely worth a watch!",1236038400,3,673,4.333333333333333
