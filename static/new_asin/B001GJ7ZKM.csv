3611558,1,B001GJ7ZKM,"I did not like this movie. I know little about the process of childbirth,I was hoping to gain some insight on my own, but I felt like this movie was ""all up in your face"" that hospital births are BAD, instead of presenting it in a non biased view. Both sides of the argument are not fairly represented. Either ways I just didn't enjoy this movie. It just bombards you with somewhat the same message and constant repetition of how you should do home birth, no drugs during it, because its bad for you yada yada yada... Just 20 mins of watching I became extremely uninterested. Despite the facts and information presented, I still feel indifferent towards the subject of childbirth location,use of anesthesia,etc, because this is a biased film. Furthermore this film should not to named PREGNANT in America, it hardly touches on pregnancy, just child birth. This is misleading as when I first read the title I was expecting it to maybe talk about a broader topics of pregnancy in general, such as controversial topics like teen pregnancy or even how pregnant woman are treated in corporate America. I can't help but think its called ""Pregnant in America"" just to attract more attention as it did for me, this should be called ""Don't Give Birth at the Hospitals, Because Clearly Home Birth is Better, We Do it, So Should You"".",1245542400,11,1323,4.706896551724138
3611559,1,B001GJ7ZKM,"I can't begin to describe how irritating I found this movie. Although I am totally pro home-birth and alarmed by the birth statistics in the US, I could not get past how self-absorbed the filmmaker/father was. I really regret having watching this film, except for the brief clips of Ina May Gaskin. She's awesome and outshines any penny-ante Michael Moore wannabes.",1242086400,43,365,5.0

3611595,1,B001GJ7ZKM,"If Steve Buonaugurio ever makes another movie, I sincerely hope it is not as horribly biased as this one.  This movie gave a very one-sided, skewed view on childbirth.  I think it was terribly insulting to the entire obstetric community, but especially to those who are involved in and advocate for natural childbirth as I feel this movie completely misrepresented what most people in that specialty stand for.  Throughout the entire film, he is so close-minded and judgmental that it became difficult for me to watch it.  I was hoping that by the end, he would be able to express some gratitude for the medical treatment his daughter received, which most likely saved her life, however; the ending was the worst part for me.
In my opinion, the ending of the movie in which he states that he and his wife were never provided with a diagnosis and/or a reason for their daughter's hospitalization is a complete fabrication. He clearly filmed the IV gentamicin running in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), so it would appear that his daughter had some type of infection. It seems highly unlikely that the hospital treatment team wouldn't provide him and his wife with a reason for why his daughter was hospitalized, especially if there was a clear explanation, such as an infectious process.  What seems much more likely is that he withheld the truth about his daughter's hospitalization in order to justify and perpetuate his negative beliefs about the obstetric community and healthcare system in the United States, which I think is terribly deceitful and despicable.  The healthcare system in this country is far from perfect, it is far from where it probably should be, but trying to incite people with inaccurate information is deplorable.
There are a multitude of reasons as to why I disliked this film, however; what I especially despised was how he made it seem as though women who choose to have epidurals during labor are weaker than women who choose to have their babies naturally.  I think defining a woman's strength by whether she chooses to have her baby with or without the use of medications is absolutely asinine.  Perhaps Steve Buonaugurio should experience the labor associated with childbirth before he portrays such foolishness in his film.",1426032000,4,2266,4.96042216358839
3611596,1,B001GJ7ZKM,"I feel sorry for the wife the most...

3611598,1,B001GJ7ZKM,My wife asked me to sit down and watch this video as she and I are expecting. Within 10 minutes of starting to video it was clear what kind of movie this would be.... anti medical establishment and the husband in the video clearly is not interested on whether or not his wife is in pain. Overall this documentary is a joke and will leave those with half a brain nauseated.,1401753600,,372,4.253521126760563
3611599,1,B001GJ7ZKM,"I had a feeling this movie would go from bad to worse after the opening montage included comments on mothers dying during childbirth in hospitals at alarming rates.... thanks for that... I really need to hear that right now...  and then the overkill image of the supposed-to-be ironic pregnant mother, standing next to the Statue of Liberty, with the flag waving behind her. My feeling was correct. Gist of the documentary: home births = you love your kid and your wife. Hospital births = you're an ill informed do-do who is willing to hand your child over to the evils of the medical system. Bonus thought: American attitude toward childbirth is killing babies and ruining people's lives, and doctors and nurses are basically just clocking in and out for a paycheck. (really? hmm I know lots of nurses, your theory dude seems a little hmmm bias? and insulting).

**Spoiler alert (which will save you precious time you would have wasted watching this): The couple making this documentary end up needing emergency care for their baby at a hospital after a successful home birth. Instead of feeling gratitude to the nurses and doctors working to save their child's life, this father creates a series of scary hospital images over top erie music, and while the baby is getting cared for, he says the nurses are moving the baby ""in ways a mother NEVER would"" and that they're ""just going about their jobs"" - as if to say this baby is being maltreated. At that point, I thought his lack of gratitude and humility had hit rock bottom. Then he describes how he had to really ""manage"" the nurses (can you just imagine what a jerk he was to everyone trying to save his baby's life?) and chastises the nurses as ""wanting to hold my baby more than me"" - huffing and puffing about how it should FIRST be the mother holding the baby THEN the father, THEN the family, THEN the friends, THEN maybe the nurses. For real? This is all you could find to be upset with the hospital for? After 9 months of chastising the medical system for the sake of the documentary, and making the word ""hospital"" out to be a dirty word, he couldn't just admit that maayyybe there are times when medical intervention is necessary, and acquiesce to that fact. Nope, instead he says his baby never had a firm diagnosis, and basically leads the viewer to believe that they were just keeping the baby for observation so they could eek money out of them (not save their kid). What a waste of resources and time for a documentary film. At the very end, he dedicates this to mothers, which after all this mother-shaming and lack of empathy (coming from this man), I can't understand how he thinks this is useful for any woman about to give birth or who has given birth.",1399593600,9,2727,4.597535934291581
3611600,1,B001GJ7ZKM,"I agree that this movie was terrible. I had a natural birth in a hospital with a midwife, it was a wonderful experience. Hospitals are not are enemies, and this movie has no substance, its made by an zealot with little understanding of the complex issues surrounding both natural birth and hospital births, as well as little understanding of narrative, story telling and film making .

3611601,1,B001GJ7ZKM,"Horridly biased, scattered documentary. I appreciate the wish of the couple to have a natural birth and their angst for the medical establishment. However, the way that the husband turns his wife into a bit player in a film that is supposed to be centered on her natural birth experience is appalling, as is his behavior toward medical staff.  This movie offers some good information which is unfortunately eclipsed completely by the boorish narrator. Overall, it is not at all helpful to a woman seeking a natural birth.",1384128000,4,521,4.920454545454546

The filmmaker blatantly lies about many statistics and aspects of childbirth, specifically about the effects of an epidural on a child. He literally had people saying that epidurals cause suicide, nightmares, ADHD, and drug addiction in teenagers.

A simple google search/common sense debunks 80% of this malarky.",1373414400,4,469,5.077922077922078
3611603,1,B001GJ7ZKM,"As a health advocate and natural birth advocate, I was looking forward to this movie based on a brief look
at the summary. I have to agree with other reviewers in that this film is so poorly done that it's tough to watch.
I also was expecting to hear more from the film maker's wife--the one actually giving birth--but throughout the
vast majority of the movie it's about her husband and his experience throughout his daughter's birth.

The ending was a complete disaster and the viewer is left totally confused with no closure or explanation as
to why the film maker's baby is in the hospital. I agree with other viewers that it had a very dishonest tone and
it just seemed like something wasn't quite right--like he was trying to hide something. I wouldn't recommend this
film to anyone and will check out The Business of Being Born since it has much better reviews. Don't waste your time
on this movie.",1368144000,7,905,4.58641975308642
3611604,5,B001GJ7ZKM,"I gave it a 5 star rating because this couple were willing to risk ""what other people would think and say""; what the medical establishment would say or would try to do against them; what could go right or ""wrong"" and still show it as best they could.  THe Author had enough media expertise to present an interesting and informative movie inspite of the fact he is not a Century 21st major Movie producer?  And so what if he took up a Michael Moore style of producing the film.  How many movies are not built on past models and styles from other movies/or documentaries... PLEASE!!!
They were transparent, granted we did not know the conditions that warranted a hospital stay for Bella the baby... perhaps there were legal threats from the hospital and/or were only allowed to film the ""good parts""...  However, He was able to tell us how extremely difficult it was to manage the hospital staff.  How it was difficult to stay on top of what they were doing. I think if you really have experience and are educated about the politics behind birthing in America, you should have no problem reading between the lines.  I believe this film was transparent and honest... giving people who do not know much about birthing in America something to think about.  I give this couple an A+ in their effort to tell American women and the world what a woman who is pregnant could be up against when trying to give birth to her baby, here in America.",1357862400,3,1434,4.556420233463035

His wife is crying because she's overwhelmed and scared making the movie and their first child at the same time and he sticks the camera in her face.  She was in pain and wanted medication and to go to the hospital and he wouldn't let her. Their baby couldn't breath and he finally allowed her to go to the hospital.  He even flat out says ""It was my decision to make.""  Like the mom had no say.  And then he STILL blames the docs and makes them out to be evil.

3611609,1,B001GJ7ZKM,"The movie is badly done on a technical level, especially the way interviews are cut.  However, I could easily look past that if it weren't for...

The father creating this film is narcissistic, aggressive and puts very little of his wife into the film.  She's the one having the baby, yet we get precious little of her perspective.  It's all about the father, who is rude and self-absorbed.

Friends, we all know the medical side of childbirth in this country is often behind the times, compared to other countries and pro-natural research.  However, treating medical staff like evil villains does nothing to improve anything.  I've known several OB/GYN's and hospitals who are adamantly for natural childbirth and respecting the Mother Nature.  There is no need to make sweeping assumptions that all doctors are crooks, which is essentially what this film does.

3611631,5,B001GJ7ZKM,I have read several of the comments giving this DVD fewer stars than I am. I give it 5 because I think it has important information for a society so far removed from natural birth. I found the interviews with professionals in other countries valuable. It shows how other highly technologically developed countries do not interfere with natural child birth. In the U.S. natural birth is more looked at something people in third world countries do and seeing other modern societies preferring to labor and birth at home is very educational. I have given birth at home seven times and still found value in the movie even though he worded things different than I would or concentrated on different aspects of natural birth vs. hospital birth than I would have. I have loaned my copy to several of my friends who all learned something from it.,1330387200,9,838,4.7465753424657535
3611632,1,B001GJ7ZKM,"This documentary is self-absorbed, inaccurate, and offensive in every way. I found it very hard to watch, and I confess I didn't watch it from start to finish.
I am an aspiring midwife (3 months to go!), nurse, and former doula- I agree that there are few things more amazing than being able to witness and participate in a normal birth. But, no...this documentary is not a celebration of anything.  In fact, I've never seen a film that's so blatantly hateful and full of misleading and incomplete information. I'm actually quite disappointed that some of the experts that I appreciate and look up to were a part of this film.

What was particularly troubling was the filmmaker's account of his daughter's hospitalization at the end of the film. I agree with another post that it is likely that their daughter had GBS, and whether or not this is true, if a critical infant requires hospitalization, there isn't always a diagnosis. And it was absolutely 100% appropriate for the midwife to recognize tachypnea and other signs of distress in the newborn and recommend taking the baby to the hospital.  The anger and immaturity of the filmmaker manifested as attacks against the care team at the hospital was misguided and childish.

Not everyone in the hospital is out to get you. Healthcare is a service, and that is why a lot of kind, compassionate, and intelligent people go into this field, people who work very hard to ensure the safety and health of others.  People who lose sleep over little details of quality on a regular basis, believe me I know.

The healthcare system is not perfect and there are a lot of problems in Obstetrics- but this sort of response is disproportionate and unproductive.

Besides, the film just isn't even good.

My advice, skip it- it's unwatchable- and unnecessarily depressing.",1327881600,15,1813,4.844660194174757
3611633,3,B001GJ7ZKM,"My husband and I viewed this film last night as we are getting prepared for our first homebirth after five hospital births.  Yes, there is a high rate of c-sections in hospitals and also the use of pitocin (inductions) is high. I never had a c-section with my first five however I was induced with four of my children and always from a Monday-Friday as not to inconvenience the doctor.  However, I also believe that there are doctors out there whom do care about their patients well being and if it weren't for medical doctors, my first son would of possibly died if it weren't for the quick action/thinking of the NICU.  I was very disappointed at how he made it seem as though his daughter was being tortured at the hospital after clearly (their midwife sent them to the hospital because obviously there was a problem with the baby)she had serious issues.  He also stated he was never given a diagnosis however sometimes babies whom are perfectly healthy in the womb wind up needing medical attention for unknown causes. He apparently hated medicine/hospitals however we cannot clump all medical doctors as horrible, money hungry crooks.  My first OB was very good and if it weren't for his attention and care, I would of winded up in the hospital with preclampsia.
Homebirths are safe for low risk women however all midwives should have back-up plans (in case of emergencies) like I do in case something should go wrong. I am thankful I live only 10 minutes from the hospital and have received very good medical attention there for my prior births.  I am due any day now and excited and looking forward to my first homebirth however am keeping an open mind.",1327708800,,1660,4.667808219178082
3611634,1,B001GJ7ZKM,"This documentary was both astonishingly incorrect and hypocritical. The director and his wife will likely be inspiration for many couples of equal or lesser intelligence in their misguided and irritatingly superior attempt to stick it to the medical system. While a very few of their points regarding health care costs and greedy practitioners have merit, the overall idea this film conveys to the public is that doctors and medicine cannot be trusted. And, what about the deeper messages it sends to women? According to Steve and Mandy, childbirth without medicine proves you are a real woman. Women who give in to any form of pain medication are weak and selfish for subjecting the baby to the narcotics. Hospitals are not only unnecessary, but if you choose to give birth there, you obviously don't want to nurture your child or bother breastfeeding. Not to mention, women are so weak they will not be able to stand up to the doctors that are itching to slice them open and pry the baby from their bosom before bonding is able to inflict mother or child. Besides, the earlier the better... complications result in longer stays and larger bills!

With poisonous accusations such as these, a pregnancy would be a terrifying concept. Luckily, I found out for myself that in all but the rarest of cases, humanity prevails. And, since my first child was born mere months after this documentary's finale birth, I am willing to bet anyone can disprove 90% of the statements from this movie. I gave birth at a very large, teaching hospital with a wonderful female doctor that was available and approachable throughout my entire pregnancy. I chose a large birthing suite, invited friends and family, had birthing balls, a large tub for water birthing, a television with DVD and cable, the ability to roam freely until the very end of the labor, and attentive nurses and my doctor on the floor (yet, discrete enough to minimize interruptions to the family) available throughout the process. I had full control over my decisions, a pre-written plan between me and the doctor for the birth, midwives and lactation specialists on hand, and the hospital did not believe in inducing or scheduling a c-section without medical necessity. My husband was able to cut the cord and I was able to hold my son the moment he emerged, and within minutes of his following cleanup and PKU routine. I did not even rest those first few days as he was in the room with me and the breastfeeding specialist made frequent trips to my room to establish a habit for us to feed regularly and offer assistance. I even gave him his first bath in the nursery once I was feeling up to it. Now, that said, I was induced since I had high blood pressure and was at risk for pre-eclampsia as well as diabetes. I was one day past term before my doctor finally gave in to that option. I did have an epidural, my choice, and it only limited my legs from moving so I was capable of pushing and otherwise participating. In fact, I had intended to hold out if I was not in too much pain, but the ridiculous and distracting discomfort was enough to completely change my mind. Once it was in place, I was actually able to relax, nap, and honestly enjoy the birth pain-free. I cannot imagine not choosing to create such a peaceful and exciting memory and feel sorrow for women that miss out on that feeling. I also needed stitches afterward and again felt nothing during the process other than joy in holding my new baby. After leaving the hospital, I felt sore but confident in the fact that my child was part of my family. My doctor and her nursing staff demanded a picture at the checkup, and when I returned for prenatal care a month after that for the next child, they were pleased to see us again and more than welcoming.

Perhaps my experience is unique.. however, I cannot recommend any other option after the amazing treatment I received. My second birth was more complicated, and in fact makes me concerned for the infant Bella that was born with her cord around her neck! My daughter was as well, along with other issues, and what is not addressed in the movie is that depending on the severity of the oxygen loss and duration of time her breathing was limited, there could be long term effects on both her mental abilities as well as physical problems. The fact that her subsequent breathing difficulties and lethargy were possibly related to the cord constriction at birth did not seem to come up again in the film makes me strongly suspect the director chose to leave off the explanation on why his daughter may have been hospitalized for days in the NICU. It would hurt his stance to mention that his own daughter may end up with mental retardation or other learning disabilities for a condition that can be prevented... in a hospital. My daughter was only cut off for a few minutes as the staff responded quickly and a passing doctor stepped in to safely deliver her, naturally, when her monitors suddenly went offline and she moved into the birth canal hours before we expected. While in my case, it was a quick change, Mandy seemed to have been in hard labor for an extended period of time and if the cord was limiting Bella's air intake, her decision to stay home may have resulted in a lost opportunity to prevent brain damage. I am not saying that natural birth is impossible or dangerous in every instance... just that hospitals have policies and practices in place due to necessity and hindsight.

In my opinion, there is only one message that expecting mothers should heed, and it is, ironically, the main argument of the movie: Take charge, ladies! Furthermore, I sincerely hope that women will realize pain during childbirth proves nothing. Personally, I refuse to suffer unnecessarily to avoid upsetting misinformed or fanatical strangers that choose not to research their views. If you want to make the correct choice, find out what is true for you. Visit hospitals and doctors, talk to the nurses, patients, and visitors to find out what you could expect in each office. Try more than one birthing class, perhaps in different styles, to see what works for you. Decide through research and what makes sense to you if you agree with use of medicine or monitors during labor.

Stop listening and start thinking.

3611636,1,B001GJ7ZKM,"Natalie Jane's review and nurses perspective I couldn't agree with more.  Buonaugurio bumbles along trying to make a point about home birth but fails by being totally a self absorbed, poorly dressed, inarticulate meathead. Sticking the camera in his wifes face, when she clearly seemed annoyed, was painful to watch. That scene where shes crying, suggesting that the traveling and (implied) the film was bringing her down. And then during the birth it appeared she didn't even want  Buonaugurio near her, as the sign on the door said keep out. I was thinking maybe her labor was so long because she had to worry about where  Buonaugurio was and if he had the camera on. At the end I was expecting to find out she left him. Only truly interesting parts were the interviews in Holland and Germany showing how natural birth is common and integrated into the culture and medical system. It's too bad since the concept of the film was to promote midwifery and home birth and it really just left me annoyed. Hospitals aren't bad. It's a complex system with problems that saved your daughters life.",1320710400,4,1091,4.761904761904762
3611637,1,B001GJ7ZKM,"First, I have to point out how poorly made this movie was. Everything from the lighting, to the background music, to the decision of when to cut an interview was tasteless. Probably the most nauseating part was Steve's inclusion of his own emotional and unintelligent conversations with himself, which show him to be the meat-head you well imagined as the creator of this vacuous project.

As for the content and the message, Steve's belligerent attacks on the medical community at large detract from what is truly a valid complaint against the American birthing system. He tries to vilify multiple health institutions for not allowing him to use his camera. Steve may have glossed over HIPAA as a silly excuse, but as a registered nurse I can assure you that those rules are real and necessary. What if the camera had caught a group of healthcare professionals trying to have a private conversation about a patient's HIV status? There is a reason you can't walk around a hospital with a camcorder.

Steve also criticized administrative personnel for their trivialization of his questions and concerns. Given Steve's unprofessional dress, demeanor, and conversational skills, I don't blame them one bit for asking if he went to college. I might have asked if he had finished high school.

What REALLY got me irate was Steve's commentary on the NICU staff. Just as everyone who supports the natural childbirth movement teaches, sometimes things don't go according to plan and mother or baby must go to the hospital. When Steve and Mandy had to take their newborn to the hospital Steve had the following complaints:
- He wasn't immediately given a list of evidence for treatment, alternatives, options, and percentages (Hey Steve, maybe they were too busy taking care of your newborn child to compile all the statistics for you.)
- The baby was poked with too many needles because the nurse missed the first time. (Ever heard the term needle in a haystack? That's kind of what finding a vein in an infant is like. I'd like to see you try, Steve.)
- The baby was moved in ways ""a mother would never move her child"" (Next time, just keep your baby at home where only you and mom can touch it. But don't get angry when the baby dies from lack of medical attention.)
- The baby was looking around frantically wondering where mom was, and instead was only able to see people ""just doing their job"" who weren't in love with the baby. (Again, keep the baby at home if this bothers you. But, well, yeah, it might die. And next time you see a NICU nurse, tell them thank you because by ""just doing their job"" they have saved the lives of countless infants.)
- The nurses wanted to hold the baby too much, and I'm the father. (But wait, Steve, I thought the nurses were heartless androids, just doing a job. Do you want them to care or do you not want them to care? For the love of God, please quite whining.)
- We never got a diagnosis after repeatedly questioning the doctors. (You're right Steve, they probably were avoiding you. Because you are just that annoying and obnoxious.)

And just when you think he couldn't be more of a pompous ass, he says, ""It took a lot of work to manage the hospital staff, because they weren't perfect, far from perfect."" MANAGE? You had to MANAGE them?? You must have had one heck of a quickie course to become an M.D. or R.N. overnight and start managing these people. Next time, I'll hold the camera and  you can spend seven 12-hour shifts taking care of a sick newborn while the parents hover obsessively over your shoulder. And while you're at it I'll ask you to throw in a couple extra peripheral IV's. I'd like to see how you ""manage"" that.

More women do need to know that childbirth can happen without being ""pitted"" or speared by an epidural. Unfortunately this documentary leaves women with nothing but more fear and uncertainty and is completely counterproductive.",1318464000,14,3900,4.686131386861314

I didn't think it was that annoying like other reviewers have said, but some things were unclear.  It has a lot of interviews with knowledgeable people.  I watched it on Hulu for free.  The only thing that I would like to see is some info on circumcision!  This video talks about infant mortality, and the US having a high death rate which is completely true, but one way of preventing some needless deaths(about 117 babies in the US per yr) is not performing non-religious infant circumcision and this video does not even mention it which was disappointing.  The other thing that I was disappointed in was that it did not talk about nutrition in pregnancy(need lots of protien, fruits and veggies, whole food supplements, less/no junk food, etc), which there is a huge need for in the US!  But, you will never find a perfect video or book on birth I don't think, so I still give it 4 stars.  I also recommend the book Ina Mays Guide to Childbirth, the site mothering.com including their online community, and the movie The Business of Being Born(watch free on Youtube)",1314144000,,1248,4.640909090909091

However this film is very biased and on several points inaccurate. Ex. Epidural use is linked to teenage drug abuse and suicide. Really.  I personally had a completely natural birth, I share a family bed, breastfed my son for 17mo, and use cloth diapers.... And even I by the end of this film wanted to punch that man in the face.

Dont give in!!!

Sure there is plenty of great stories of wonderful births that have happen right in someones bedroom.. so nice :)... but then their is just as many stories about awful things that happen at home too...

I don't think I will ever do a home birth, to me it's just too risky. I think I might do natural birth in a hospital. But it's good to educate yourself on what your options are when you are having your baby. It was interesting to find out about the health risks of drugs that are given to women during labor, but in the movie they make them sound like you are betraying your baby if you use them, when in the end Mandy (his wife) was screaming for an epidural! I also thought it was silly that he made most of these doctors and nurses the enemy right off the bat...that's not really fair because most of them really do care, or they wouldn't be in the medical feild. I also was annoyed that he kept going back to these hospitals to pick fights about their practicing methods. I think we should educate ourselves, because doctors can be wrong, but don't go to belittle them. I think it's sad that doctors are turning to C-sections, and that is not right. For me I took away some good knowledge, but in the end if I'm 20 hours into labor and want an epidural it still will probably happen...",1310256000,,1157,4.235294117647059

His attitude about the  nurses and doctors and the bill after they saved his daughter's life. The way he was contemplating whether or not to send his daughter to the hospital (I don't think it takes much contemplation -- his wife and their midwife knew hospital was the answer immediately and he had to ponder if he was willing to send his child to the hospital because he just hates the idea of it?

3611645,4,B001GJ7ZKM,"I enjoyed the film a lot. I think sometimes when you are living in a society that is so pro-hospital, you need to fight back with a heavy version of the other side of things. There's nothing wrong with feeling passion for your views, and I was not disappointed. There is a dearth of information on and people willing to sell you a stay in the hospital for your birth, so the underdogs needed to raise their voices a little louder to get people to stop and think about homebirths. If you watch the interviews on the street you will see that the majority of society can't even fathom drug-free, hospital-free births. This film is just trying to show another side of things. I especially enjoyed the segment where they went to Holland.

If you are so offended and worried about people becoming afraid of hospitals then make your own documentary showcasing how women are treated in them, and make the case that it's ""not so bad"", but don't put down a couple's effort to explore the process of childbirth in America because it doesn't mesh with your opinion. The idea here is for all of us to have the information to make our own choices, and I applaud this couple with sharing their views. Now get out there, watch it, get informed about all your options and make a choice you're comfortable with, home, hospital or otherwise!",1306195200,,1322,4.554621848739496

3611647,1,B001GJ7ZKM,"This movie was so one-sided and misleading I wanted to vomit.  The husband and wife are so home-birth, anti-hospital it is sickening.  The husband seems to have the attitude that ALL women should give birth naturally, and gives the impression that there is never any good reason for a c-section.  He seeks out the opinions of medical 'professionals' and women who only agree with his views.  As a registered nurse, I had to roll my eyes when he lists off all of the potential complications of an epidural or c-section, including fetal and maternal death.  In case he was unaware, those are also risks of CHILDBIRTH in general.  As someone who had a c-section (not by choice-I actually had a midwife for my prenatal care & delivery and we tried everything to get the baby out before having to resort to the c-section), this movie disgusts me.  After the birth of their child, there are some complications and they have to take the baby to the hospital, where she has to spend a few days in the NICU.  You'd think after the hospital staff save his baby's life, he would admit that maybe hospitals do have some value and be grateful...but no; all he can do is complain about the hospital experience, and how he never recieved a diagnosis for his baby.  I can tell you by looking at her, the baby was in respiratory distress!  There's your diagnosis.  This guy is a true moron, and the movie is not informative in the least if you are looking for objective, factual information backed with scientific data and statistics.",1301184000,7,1517,4.623134328358209
3611648,5,B001GJ7ZKM,"Steve does a great job shedding some light on the injustices being perpetrated on women, children and FAMILIES in our American Society. Why is the average C-Section rate in the US now at 30% of all births? Why are some particular hospital and particular doctors C-section rates approaching 80% or higher even when factoring in low risk pregnancies? Either something is drastically wrong with the nutrition in our society or something is drastically wrong with the medical system in our society.. or both. It is well documented that vitamin deficiencies lead to muscle weakening hence the inability of the mother to successfully ""push"" can be affected.

Spoiler alert: Let me clarify a few things: I never found a comment in the video saying ""Mandy's membranes ruptured"". It is true that a few hours after birth the couple's midwife was concerned for their child so they took their newborn to the hospital. As Steve says their child was held for 3 days in the NICU, 7 days in the hospital, for ""observation purposes"" yet no one ever provided a ""diagnosis"". Their reward for erring on the side of caution? A hospital bill for $21,978. I was disappointed to hear of the American couple who went to Canada for the VBAC ultimately required a second C-section for Maximus. However, it is amazing and noteworthy in Canada the bill for the hospital stay for both the mother (Betsy) and child (Maxiumus) as well as the surgery (C-section) was only $10,000 (they saved $30,00 from the estimates they were given by the American hospitals) yet the bill for Bella's week long observation, not true ""intervention"" was $21,978. Only in America.

The closing theme song's chorus was very appropriate: ""Stand up! Start a Revolution! We're not going to take it anymore!"" Steve's mission seems to be Women, stand up! Start a revolution of taking CONTROL of your health! Look behind what you are being told to see that ultimately the doctor's schedule and inconvenience factors as the hospital's schedule is all too frequently behind their recommendations. ""It's all about the mighty dollar.""

Steve hit the nail on the head when he discusses the McDonaldization of the birthing process here in the US.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For moms to be, for dads to be, for grandparents to be, for midwives (and to be) and for medical professionals (and those to become):  Steve is casting a light on a very dark recess of Western Medicine.  It will bite some people hard and will shake others to their core.  Some WILL find this movie VERY offensive - especially those who have yet to see The Dark Side of Modern Western Medicine.  I have endured many experiences with Modern Western Medicine - from the Good, to the Bad, to the very very Ugly.  One thing this movie WILL do - it will ignite a response in most everyone who watches it, from enlightening to those who were not aware of the depth of the dark side, to anger and frustration to those who are in denial about the dark side.  Do NOT discredit this movie just because you have not yet witnessed the darkness of Modern Western Medicine - countless numbers of us have.  When medical professionals ""accidentally"" cause a spouse to experience death and when medical professionals turn away someone suffering from classic symptoms of pulmonary embolisms and heart attacks with major prior medical history including 19 years of chronic recurrent life-threatening complications they ultimately help educate some of us that there really is a dark side to medicine.  Whether it's an ""oops"" or it's a failure to read medical reports before prescribing, treating, or failing to treat is one issue, but attempting to cover it up, or to attempt to coerce patients into further unnecessary procedures to further help cover it up is not only unethical, it further alienates some of us from Modern Western Medicine's possible benefits.  All of the above, and much much worse, has happened to myself or to my spouse.  I have seen the bad side of medicine far too many times, in too many facilities, by too many so-called ""medical professionals"" which has only served to shatter the engendered reliance previously instilled.

When it comes to SEVERE TRAUMA, yes, there is a time and place for Modern Western Medicine.  However when it comes to routine BIRTHING, or chronic dis-ease, or other ""routine"" situations the system has become engrained there are often far better alternatives outside of the system.",1301184000,3,4433,4.936827956989247
3611649,1,B001GJ7ZKM,"My husband and I watched this movie together as we are currently expecting.  I made it further than my husband (almost to the end), but we still turned it off early because we were so frustrated and annoyed with the husband/filmmaker!  We are opting to have our baby in a birthing center and definitely support a more natural approach to birth, but I agree with the other comments that say the filmmaker's attitude towards hospitals was ridiculous and over the top.  He seemed so hell bent on making his point that by the end of the movie I was not sure I could even trust some of the information given.  Even after the hospital staff saved his baby's life, all he could do was complain that the nurses wanted to hold her too much!  Gimme a break! Yes, there are reasons to be informed and skeptical towards birthing in a hospital, but the way he portrayed hospitals and the people who work in them got to be pretty offensive.  Do yourself a favor and skip this movie.  The filmmaker is a dopey dumbo.",1300838400,7,1001,4.437158469945355
3611650,1,B001GJ7ZKM,"I wish I could give this movie less than 1 star. I won't repeat what all the other negative reviews have said, but I completely agree. I support ANY method of birth the mother and father choose and feel most comfortable with, and am so thankful there is free choice in the matter. I know women who have had beautiful births at home/in birthing center, however this movie made me feel angry toward that option. I don't believe the filmmaker did any favors to the midwifery system with this film.",1300406400,4,494,4.5
3611661,1,B001GJ7ZKM,First off this movie isn't about pregnancy in America. Its about childbirth. Second the view of this movie is so biased and one sided. There is no representation of both sides so that the viewer can use the information presented to make up their own mind. Hospital birth is completely looked down upon as are epidurals and c-sections. C-sections are viewed as completely elective which is not always the case. My sister had to have an emergency c-section because my nephew's heart rate dropped. Thank goodness she was in the hospital. And what about mothers of multiples or those with other health issues that can create complications? Also premature birth should be considered. Its just ridiculous to assume home birth is the safest choice in ALL situations. When they started talking about women having orgasms during labor I laughed out loud. In one instance an older man goes on about how painless natural child birth is based on some story out of Africa. This movie may have set out to prove a point but it was sorely lost within the biased material. No medical evidence was shown proving home birth is better or by far safer than hospital birth. Child birth is a miracle regardless of how they get here and no expecting mother should be made to feel less of a woman for not having a natural home birth. To each his own. If someone wants to have their child at home or in a tub of water or without drugs that is their choice. It is also their choice to have them in a hospital with or without drugs or by whatever means possible. Whatever is best for mama and baby I say. This movie doesn't educate. It only tries to force an opinion on you.,1300147200,8,1646,4.526845637583893
3611662,4,B001GJ7ZKM,"First off I want to say that the message of this movie was supposed to be a good one. That America's way of dealing pregnancy and childbirth has veered completely off course. The film shows the possibility that doctors may be recommending c-sections for unnecessary reasons, not being honest with patients, and interventions are way overused. It seems like the entire culture has been brainwashed into thinking that women not only don't know how to give birth, but that when they do, the entire experience is traumatic and unpleasant and the woman needs to be numbed into obvlivion because it's such a terrible experience. This film gives a peek into pregnancy in other cultures, or at least in the Netherlands, where most women have home births. There were a lot of good interviews. There were times when I found myself extremely annoyed with certain people, such as when he asked the nurse about the high c-section rate and she replied that the c-section rate was ""the lowest it's ever been.""

I also noticed that many women that were interviewed expressed an interest in having a natural birth but for one reason or another had an epidural or c-section. I am wondering why, even after all this information about the high c-section rate is being publicized, women are still choosing to use OB/GYN's for basic normal births instead of midwives?

Although I think the movie had a good point, there was no way I could give it 5 stars because it was definitely flawed. The movie is very one sided. I felt like during the course of filming, the guy had some sort of ""awekening"" to thinking hospitals were bad, and forgot that hospitals are not bad because they do actually help people who have a problem. When they took their daughter to the hospital, he had a negative attitude about the hospital in general, and claimed that the hospital charged them $10,000 and never told them what was actually wrong with the baby. I find that extremely hard to believe. He also acted extremely melodramatic at some scenes. The worst part though was that he had decided without a shadow of a doubt that his wife was having the baby naturally and doing this and doing that, when he is not the one giving birth. Ultimately it is the mother's decision how to give birth, and I felt like he would not be supportive if she changed her mind.",1299542400,4,2320,4.669926650366748
3611663,2,B001GJ7ZKM,"This film is completely one-sided. The filmmakers don't interview anyone with a different point of view than themselves. They say they ""tried"" to reach the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, but that they ""didn't speak to filmmakers."" OK, then go find 10 doctors who don't represent ACOG, and have them tell you in rational terms why all OB/GYN's aren't evil, money-grubbing monsters. I think they have a valid reason to want to encourage mothers to consider their options. I also agree that we have medicalized pregnancy in America. But at least try to present both sides accurately. Don't just use angry midwives and PhD's who have an axe to grind as your experts.",1298246400,2,684,5.008771929824562
3611664,1,B001GJ7ZKM,"There are far better films about childbirth and homebirth vs hospital birth (see The Business of Being Born).  The film makers of Pregnant in America are inexperienced and the film is difficult to watch on a technical, as well as a cognitive, level.  The narrative and narration is slow and frustrating.  Important pieces of information are dropped and then never dealt with or fully explained. Do not watch this film if you are pregnant! In fact, skip it all together.

Naturally, I am an advocate for home birth, and a woman's right to choose her own special birthplan.  However, the hospital IS NOT THE ENEMY, nor is the medical community.  This documentary only served to make me feel sorry for the wife of the selfish man who created it.  His aggressive behavior is silly and confrontational, and his communication skills are poor. Not all hospital births are horrible.  Obstetricians aren't all hell-bent on making women suffer through torturous and traumatic births.  Placing blame and pointing fingers will not heal a broken system, but only hinder it further.

Also, I believe the baby may have had Group B Streptococcus (GBS) which is a type of bacterial infection that can be passed from mother to baby during birth.  If a family is choosing home birth, testing for GBS is optional.  I think perhaps the creator of this film and his wife opted not to test for Group B Strep.  In the end of the film he claims that the hospital never told them what was going on with their newborn, but I got the impression that he was fibbing and didn't want to own up to the fact that they had decided not to test for GBS.

3611668,3,B001GJ7ZKM,"As a doula, childbirth educator, and low intervention birth advocate, I had looked forward to the release of this movie with high hopes.

In the end, I was disappointed with the film.  The film style was clearly directly copied from Michael Moore's style without any attempt to express this filmmaker's own style,  Mr. Buonaugurio has passion, and he is right that many people are left in the dark when it comes to childbirth practices in America.  But he offered very little in the way of HOPE for people.

I've had 3 home births myself, but right from the begining I was put off by the flip chart in the background that had boldly written on it ""The hospital is our enemy.""  The hospital is NOT our enemy.  It certainly is excessive for the majority of women in America to birth in hospitals rather than at home or in birthing centers, but the hospital serves a necessary role in keeping birth safe.

I continue to be annoyed at how the natural birth community misrepresents the Cytotec issue.  I am not a fan of Cytotec, and believe that it should only be used with full informed consent.  But that informed consent is being denied by BOTH sides of the debate.  The medical establishment does not make women aware that it has an increased risk of causing uterine rupture, meconium passage, and hyperstimulation of the uterus even in women with no previous cesarean sections.  The natural birth community does make women aware that the ""contraindication"" on prescribing it to pregnant women only applies to prescriptions for the treatment of ulcers because it can bring on labor.  The package insert for Cytotec specifically addresses use for labor induction, and while it does not specifically ""approve"" its use, it only contraindicates its use in women with a previous cesarean or who are on their 5th or greater pregnancy.

I was most especially annoyed by the failure of the moviemaker to more fully address the NICU stay of his daughter.  He invited us into this deeply personal area of his life, and then for reasons unknown, did not provide a full explaination of what happened in the NICU.  It was clear to me from looking at the baby in the hospital that the original transfer had merit--her respiration was clearly not normal.  But the days of ""observation"" after she was released from the NICU...what was going on there?  I suspect it was an unnecessary treatment that may be part of the reason the movie provides no real hope for the viewer.  Mr. Buonaugurio learned first hand how difficult it can be to stand up to the medical establishment and say ""this treatment is not needed.  I'm not accepting it.""

In the end, I think this film has value if it is used as a discussion starter...but I don't think it has value if viewed as a stand-alone product.",1261958400,71,2767,4.699170124481328

This is a well-balanced view of the health system surrounding being pregnant in America. It asks questions such as: ""Why is it that the cesarean rate is 30 percent in the United States while the rest of the world considers 7 percent too high? Why are we charged so much more for fewer services in our hospitals than in other countries? Why do we give a drug to induce labor when it clearly states on the label: ""Do not give to pregnant women""? Why do most childbirths happen Monday through Friday in our hospitals? Why are we discouraged and even penalized for not wanting a cesarean birth or wanting homebirth? If you're looking for answers, you're not alone--order this DVD.

It shows the prenatal journey of an involved and concerned father, trying to uncover the ""why"" of unfair bias and non-evidence based practices in the USA when other countries are doing much better. P.S. today the USA is #36 for infant mortality. At the time this documentary was made, I believe we were at #28.",1522627200,,839,4.6375838926174495
