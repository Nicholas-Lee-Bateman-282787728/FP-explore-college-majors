8049016,3,B0007MHPPO,"""Scarface"" is the film of the Thirties which is most often brought up in discussions on the gangster movie...

According to Hawks, he directed ""Scarface"" with the idea of telling the story of the Capone family as if they were the Borgias living in Chicago in the Twenties.... This may well be- true... At the time, however, there was much publicity to suggest that ""Scarface"" was the Capone story - which it certainly wasn't...

It was a very good, exciting gangster film, and it stands up well when viewed today, more than 70 years on...

Paul Muni gave a great performance as Tony Camonte, the scarred gang-leader, but it bears little resemblance to Capone as he really was... Camonte is tough, ruthless, a handy man with a gun and - at the end - a figure hysterically afraid of death as he battles it out with police from his steel-shuttered fortress...

Capone was certainly tough and ruthless, but he tried to avoid gunplay himself and employed others to do his dirty work... He was not cowardly, and he did not die in battle...

""Scarface""should be seen and remembered as a film devised to exploit the Chicago of its day - and it must be remembered that Chicago gang wars made front-page banner headlines all over the world... It is the story of a battle for power between two gangster figures: Tony Camonte and Gaffney, played by Boris Karloff... A secondary plot hinges on Camonte's strength of feeling for his sister, Cesca (Ann Dvorak), and the romance between Cesca and Camonte's henchman, Guino Rinaldo (George Raft).

Eventually Camonte kills Rinaldo in the belief that he has violated Cesca - though the pair are actually married... This is the famous scene in which Rinaldo, whose trademark throughout the picture is his constant flipping and catching of a gold coin, drops out of picture as he dies... and the coin this time falls to the floor...

Gaffney, the rival gang-leader, is sometimes likened to Edward ""Spike"" O'Donnell, with whom Capone fought a war for control of the Chicago South Side...

In the film, however, the Gaffney character is totally unlike the real Spike, who was a rough-and-ready criminal of Irish descent with a tendency towards practical jokes... He and his three brothers, Steve, Walter and Tommy, did just about everything in their time, from bank robberies to strike-breaking, with a little pick-pocketing on the side... ""Spike"" was a devout Catholic who attended services regularly... yet his most-quoted remark is: ""When arguments fail - use a black-jack.""",1168560000,,2505,4.905437352245863
8049017,5,B0007MHPPO,"Wow. I got my master's degree in  film, but reading some of these reviews I have got to imagine there are some PHD'S out there too! Bottom line: A landmark film, with a great story and top of the line photography. Keep an eye for the director's use of the ""X"" in his lighting techniques. Other than that, don't get too cerebral or caught up in these ""academician discussions"". Its a bad ganster who got what was coming to him! Enjoy, but don't fry your brain on teh artistic subtleties. Great film!",1162080000,,498,4.413043478260869
8049018,4,B0007MHPPO,"This original version holds up reasonably well.  It manages to depict the ruthlessness of organized crime but suffers slightly from characterizations which one can only presume became cliches afterward.  But perhaps the greatest value this film provides is a snapshot of a particular time without the haze of romanticism that today's gangster films add.

Before the story begins, an opening statement is made regarding what we are about to see.  It is, warns the film, an indictment of gang warfare and of ""your"" government's ineffectiveness in combating such lethal street fighting.  It raises the question of what you, the viewer, are doing to stop the mob rule.  Although based on a novel, the film states that all the incidences are real.  In 2006 - unfortunately - such opening statements remind one of over-the-top morality tales such as ""Reefer Madness"".  Further proselityzing occurs about two-thirds into the film when a newspaper editor declares that martial law should be enacted as has been in other states for lesser offenses than gang warfare.  He further goes on to state that the government cannot enforce laws that do not exist, i.e. gun control laws at a minimum.  Considering the controversy over gun control today, one could consider this film ahead of its time.  It is also chilling to see a film espouse so strongly a violation of civil liberties and anti-foreign suspicion.

Muni plays Tony as a street-wise but uneducated thug with ambitions greater than those of his boss, Johnny Lovo.  His mannerisms are gruff, and he applies a strong accent.  Tony's mother is - alas - the caricature of a wounded immigrant mother who laments the ways of her wicked son.  His sister, Cesca, is rebellious and resents Tony's over-protectiveness.  Most notably, she lacks any foreign accent.  George Raft's character is actually tougher than Tony:  he is far more aloof and level-headed.  Osgood Perkins' Lovo is actually rather weasely and nervous, which is such a contrast to what modern viewers may be used to.

Cinematically the film really delivers.  Despite some heavy symbolism (far too many ""X"" shots mirroring Tony's scar), the atmosphere is appropriately dark and dangerous.  Although clearly set-bound, the chaos of a large city is evident.  The direction is likewise successful.  Enemies are dispatched quickly and without prolonged speeches.  No blather about ""honor"" and ""family"", just the lust for power.  No stylized violence, no sociological rationalization of their behavior.  Its gritty action outweighs some of the (very few) cornier aspects of the tale.

To summarize, this old black & white cautionary film is the first gangster movie that has ever given me nightmares.",1136678400,4,2700,5.173210161662817
8049019,5,B0007MHPPO,"A landmark movie in that it was the first to present the gangster, always portrayed up to this point by Hollywood as a misunderstood good guy gone wrong, as a senseless, moronic, cold-blooded lunatic. Paul Muni plays Tony Camonte (Scarface - obviously based on Al Capone), a hood on the way up in 1920s Chicago, who discovers the Tommy gun and shoots up half the city while gaining control of it. It also happens that he's in love with his sister, which just adds to his perversity.

The movie has a stagey ""unnaturalness"" to it, as most movies of the time did, but it's an eyeful: men are shot down left and right, businesses riddled by machine gun fire, car chases (19 cars wrecked) galore.

Muni is excellent, parading around like some Neanderthal Man, and blasting a machine gun is almost like sex to him - only better. The movie was a big step forward for Hollywood in showing the amount of realism the quickly developing cameras could portray, if allowed to.

Note: Real bullets were used when the coffee shop was shot up; one curious spectator  - silent film star Harold Lloyd's brother - lost an eye when he got too close to the set.",1129680000,7,1141,4.524271844660194
8049020,2,B0007MHPPO,"I guess for the time period of 1932 this movie was considered somewhat of a classic.  I was disappointed.  The movie plays loose with the facts as various characters play the rolls of Al Capone, Jim Colosimo, Johnny Torrio, Dean O'Banion, Hymie Weiss, Bugs Moran, and Machine Gun Jack McGurn.  All the gangsters play their rolls to the hilt with the stereotypical cigarette dangling between their lips.  I guess this movie illustrates how far movies have come since the 1930's.  I enjoy James Cagney gangster movies such as ""White Heat"" and ""Angels With Dirty Faces"", but ""Scarface"" certainly won't have a permanent place in my library.",1122508800,4,636,4.962264150943396
8049021,5,B0007MHPPO,"Before the al pachino version I always rember this scarface the on strrin Paul Muni, the first time I saw the updated version was in 2001 and i was hooked on that. The character Paul Muni played was real former gangster Al Capone back then I thought paul played an excellent role immitaing him. I was glued to this black and white film it was almost the same as the updated verson; violence, the love for his sister, and Tony lookin over that resturant sign dictating ""The world is Yours"" both charters in these movies old and new played that great to the end so ""kudos"" to both directors doin an great job in these triologys",1120953600,6,625,4.396551724137931
8049022,4,B0007MHPPO,"The first ""Scarface"" I was exposed to was that which stars Al Pacino, which was produced the same year as my birth. Though I am a fan of modern action movies with their obscene violence, gratuituous special effects and lack of subtlety, the art student in me loves true film. I was first exposed to HH's ""Scarface"" in a film class, and immediately I fell for it. Thus, Al Pacino takes a seat behind Paul Muni in my book.

Howard Hawk's ""Scarface,"" starring Paul Muni as Tony Camonte, is based loosely on the life and times of notorious gangster Al Capone. It is compelling and entertaining without the use of fake blood. The artistry lies in the film's ability to tell the viewer without words; that which is visible has become knowledge. Much like the Godfather's kiss, a coin tossed repeatedly and an X or a cross are marks of death. Shadows, bowling pins, and other objects are used to symbolize death. These marks are key characteristics that make this film almost timeless. With underlying ""forbidden love"" stories (involving his pretty sister) and comedy relief characters (the not-so-PC-by-modern-standards ""secretary,"") the 1932 ""Scarface"" is a landmark film. Not only did it pave the way for gangster movies, it was also ahead of it's time, bearing, among other things, heavy shadows, extreme close-ups, and overhead shots that would become film noir a decade later.

Though many are fixated on the remake, devout fans of the 1983 ""Scarface"" can still enjoy this prohibition-era film. The imagination comes up with things that truly can't be captured on film. See what yours can do.",1109548800,24,1591,4.910780669144981
