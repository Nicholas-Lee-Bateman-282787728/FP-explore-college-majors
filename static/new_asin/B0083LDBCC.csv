8524568,4,B0083LDBCC,This is a great video with very detailed info. He did miss couple things like what soap he uses to clean the hide. But overall I wat very pleased with it. I am currently part way through tanning my own buffalo and this video has been very helpful.,1423180800,,247,4.166666666666667
8524569,1,B0083LDBCC,The movie had lots of interesting stuff but the narrator failed to explain many areas of hide tanning and uses chemicals that he says you cant get anymore but you can make and never tells you how to make them or whats in the mix. Overall bad movie don't waste your money,1375747200,,270,4.211538461538462
8524570,5,B0083LDBCC,I thoroughly enjoyed this dvd and have found in very useful in improving my tanning skills.  Bison hides are an extreme tanning challenge and Mr. Housler's finished robes were among the very best.  I would highly recommend this dvd to those interested in pursuing this craft.,1352073600,,275,4.956521739130435
