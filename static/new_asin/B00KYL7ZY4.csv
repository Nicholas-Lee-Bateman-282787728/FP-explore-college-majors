6453834,2,B00KYL7ZY4,Poor performance. Disappointed. I doubt I will watch again.,1433894400,,59,5.666666666666667
6453835,5,B00KYL7ZY4,"I am really pleased to see that this concert has been released again under this new title. It has been released under several different titles in the past, so, in case you already own a Poco DVD, just check that you are not duplicating. The version I own is titled 'Poco in Concert', but I think its fairly safe to assume that this is the same recording.

I think this is one of the very best concerts that I have seen on DVD; we play it regularly, and always will. It is a re-union concert from 2004 in Nashville, and the Band members are Richie Furay, Rusty Young, Paul Cotton, George Grantham and Jack Sundrun, plus Tony Harrow on keyboards. The quality of the musicianship, and the harmonising, is still outstanding, and they play many of their best songs, including a few great tracks from the 'Good Feeling to Know' album. I think it is just excellent, and I recommend it to anyone who ever liked Poco.",1427068800,,908,4.437125748502994
6453836,4,B00KYL7ZY4,"This is a very entertaining DVD.  The video and structure of the concert are quite good, although the mixing is not extremely ""tight"".  No complaints, there, really.  No, it's not perfect ... menus are a bit off, extras are not tightly produced, interviews seem to wander a bit.  But who cares ... it's a very good bit of music, which is what I wanted.  Musicians are as good as they ever were.  Voices have aged and are a bit deeper, but they are still clear and unbroken ... matured, as with us all.  The only disappointment is that the tempo is not as energetic as I would have liked.  The most obvious example is in ""Rose of Cimmaron"", which has a beat, but not that crisp rocking pace that was the mark of Poco rockers.  Think of the tunes being played at 30 RPM rather than 33 1/3 RPM and you get the idea.  It's the crisp tempos of most of the original Poco recordings that hooked me so long ago, and they are just not quite there in this DVD.",1415664000,3,950,4.198895027624309

6453838,1,B00KYL7ZY4,"Be aware that this is a recording of a performance from 2004.  The audio and video quality are reflective of the technology of the time.  The project appears to have been made on the cheap...  Try though he may, Richie Furay fails to infuse these performances with the kind of energy fans have come to expect - doesn't come close to the ""Deliverin' performance... Not even up to the level that Jim Messina turned in in 2005 on ""Sittin' In...again"".  Of course, Furay is a straight geezer pastor nowadays, and he still does seem to be sincere about his work and his reverence for Poco's heritage... It is clear these guys are great musicians.  This DVD is simply not a great showcase for their talents..",1411084800,,702,4.584
6453839,4,B00KYL7ZY4,"The DVD is a joy to listen to. There are a couple of flaws, but I'll play this one often. First the line up is good. This recently released video was recorded in 2004. At the time, Richie Furay was not a part of the band, but he is in this lineup (after the first song or two). I would have loved to see Jim Messina in this lineup as well, but they sound fantastic. The songs cover the career and the band performs very well. The Quality is the only reason I don't give 5 stars. The video is okay. It's not bad, but I wouldn't classify it as HD. The sound is great but the video is recorded low & I do have to turn it up louder than my other videos. However, if you pump up the volume and kick back, it is most enjoyable. They still (well, 2004) harmonize like no one else and it is GREAT to hear them do the old stuff (You'd better think twice, Good feelin' to know, Keep on tryin', Pickin' up the pieces) as well as ""newer, more recent"" (now old) hits such as Crazy love, Call it love, Indian summer, Rose of Cimmeron, Heart of the night & much more. If the quality was better, this would be one of my favorites. As it is, it's close. It is is Definitely worth the price of admission. Go for it, you won't be sorry!",1410134400,10,1217,3.9918032786885247

8662651,5,B00KYL7ZY4,"OMG....this is my ""go to"" concert right now. It is any absolute delight.  I've been heard to play it 3-4 times,  back to back.  I just don't tire of it...EVER. I spend a lot of time in bed, for various health reasons, and it's perfect. Even a modest Poco fan will love it....I promise.",1522281600,,285,4.2407407407407405
