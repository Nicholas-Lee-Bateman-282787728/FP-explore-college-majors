8124786,2,B000FNCU4Q,"I order this one because I like model railroads. I still like model railroads but this video was a wasted 20 minutes of my life. It has little to recommend it.

Basically, it is just a series of shots of the large scale (G Scale) electric train layout from the Living Desert in California. There is no narration. There are just views of the toylike trains going about their rounds.

Some of the model structure are impressive, particularly the double track wooden trestle, but it was not interesting enough to keep my attention. Only in the last minute is there any voiceover to overcome the ""soundtrack"" but even that is just an invitation to visit the park.

As advertising for the park, this is singularly ineffective. As entertainment it is even less so and I love trains.

Save your money and your time.",1155427200,3,808,4.629370629370629
