8576693,5,B00C2TRSG6,"The last few years have been great for the films of director Elia Kazan finally being released on Blu-ray. Three of his greatest films, ""On the Waterfront"", ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and ""East of Eden"" have recently received Blu-ray presentations from Criterion and Warner Home Video respectively. Not to be outdone, Fox Home Entertainment released eight of the films he directed for 20th Century Fox on Blu-ray with little fanfare in 2012 in two volumes(four films each)  and this review is for Volume One. Kazan only directed 19 films between the years 1945 and 1976, with eight of those being at 20th Century Fox, but they covered a wide range of subject matter from anti-Semitism to racial prejudice both of which are covered in Volume One. The first film is ""BOOMERANG""(1947) and is a semi-documentary(with voice over narration) about the murder of a priest and the rush to judgment by the news media, politicians and regular townspeople to find the killer. Dana Andrews, Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb and Arthur Kennedy give great performances in this early Kazan picture. The Video quality(Aspect Ratio: 1.33.1) is very good considering the age of the picture. There's some minor print damage on a few frames but there are no vertical lines, specks, torn frames, etc. and the picture is sharp and clean and a definite improvement over the standard ""Fox Noir"" DVD released years ago. The Audio(English Mono DTS-HD Master audio) is clear also especially in the courtroom scenes. ""Boomerang"" is 88 minutes and contains the following subtitles: English SDH, Spanish and French. The only special feature is a commentary. ""GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT""(also from 1947) is the film that won Kazan his first directing Oscar and deals with anti-Semitism, a controversial subject at the time. The Video quality(Aspect Ratio: 1.33.1) is sharp and detailed. Arthur C. Miller's cinematography is given new life on Blu-ray and overall this is a vast improvement of the ""Studio Classics"" release. There is some softness in some of the scenes but this may be due to the film elements or age of the film. The Audio(English Mono DTS-HD Master audio, Spanish Mono and French Mono) is crisp and clear. ""Gentleman's Agreement"" is 118 minutes and contains the following subtitles: English SDH and Spanish. Special features include commentaries and a AMC Backstory on the making of the film. ""Gentleman's Agreement"" is also available as a separate stand alone Blu-ray from Fox. ""PANIC IN THE STREETS""(1950) is a terrific suspense story about public health officers and police trying to find a ruthless killer(played by Jack Palance) who is exposed to a deadly plague in order to stop an epidemic in New Orleans. The Video quality(Aspect Ratio: 1.33.1) is the best of the four films in Volume One, with one scene after another being sharp and clear with no film damage. Filmed almost entirely on location in New Orleans, ""Panic"" has never looked better than it does on Blu-ray. The Audio(English Mono DTS-HD Master audio) is exceptional too. ""Panic in the Streets"" is 96 minutes and contains the following subtitles: English SDH, Spanish and French. Special features include commentaries and two biographies of Jack Palance and Richard Widmark. ""Panic in the Streets"" is also available as a separate stand alone Blu-ray from Fox. ""PINKY""(1949)  is the fourth and last film in the set and deals with racial prejudice in the South. It features Oscar nominated performances from Jeanne Crain, Ethel Waters and Ethel Barrymore and was a controversial film for it's time. The Video quality(Aspect Ratio: 1.33.1) is good but not as sharp as it could have been on Blu-ray. Once again this may be due to the film elements and source rather than the restoration. It is the weakest of the four films in this set. There is a lot of brightness and softness in some of the scenes which might be distracting to some. The Audio(English Mono DTS-HD Master audio) is much better with dialogue being very clear and sharp. Overall, this is the best that ""PINKY"" will probably look until a better film source is found. ""PINKY"" is 102 minutes and contains the following subtitles: English SDH, Spanish and French. Special features include only a commentary by film scholar Kenneth Geist. Those are the four Kazan films in Volume One. The packaging is much different than Fox's ""The Elia Kazan Collection"". For this set, Fox has released it in the standard Blu-ray case which holds each of the four Blu-ray films on two plastic gates inside the case. They have also provided a cardboard slipcase for the Blu-ray for further protection. I would not pay what some sites are selling this set for. I got both Volumes from Fox Connect for a lot less(around $12.00 a Blu-ray) with free shipping. As soon as I watch Volume Two, I'll be posting my review. Until then, ""Kazan at Fox"" should be a must for any film collectors library.",1388707200,5,4874,4.964504283965728
