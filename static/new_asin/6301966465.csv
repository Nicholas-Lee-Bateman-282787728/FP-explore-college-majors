384736,5,6301966465,"First of all...to all High School students out there who are required to read Steinbeck's book ""Cannery Row"" ...if you try to get by with just watching this movie and writing your report your grade will suffer!  Oh, it has nothing to do with the quality of the film...I'll get to that  later, it's just that this film is a blending of two of Steinbeck's books,  ""Cannery Row"" and ""Sweet Thursday.""  Both of those  stories are set along Cannery Row in Pacific Grove/Monterey, CA, and have  many of the same characters in them, but unless you already know the  stories you may well include material from ""Sweet Thursday"" in  your report on ""Cannery Row,"" and...OOPS...there goes the old  grade!  So, beware!  Now...on with the review...
Nolte plays  ""Doc"" the main character in the story.  His character is based on  a real life person, a marine scientist named Ed Ricketts who lived and  worked along Cannery Row (which was certainly not the tourist attraction in  the 1930s-40s that it is today).  You can, by the way, still see the  building where Doc Ricketts worked if you visit Pacific Grove...it's just  down the road from the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  OK, OK, enough history, back  to the movie...
Nolte does a great job of playing the out of the way, but  not really down and out ""Doc.""  Things are going along smoothly  until Winger hits the scene, then there's romance in the air, though it  doesn't land until much later.
I suppose you could call this movie a  romantic comedy, or you could call it a romance, or you could call it  drama, or you could call it real life -- Steinbeck was like that -- he was  into real life.
This is, I agree, an underrated film.  It's true that  there are slower parts, and if you don't like narration in films then you  won't like this one much.  If you're looking for a barn-burner action  thriller this is NOT the film for you.  But if you are looking for  interesting character and plot development you will enjoy this  film.
Nolte and Winger have good on-screen chemistry, and you will enjoy  being the mouse in the corner are you observe their developing  relationship.
5 stars for the thoughtful crowd.

384737,5,6301966465,"I saw this by accident when it originally came out in 1982 (the movie I planned to see was sold out).  I loved it.  I have watched it many times since then and I still enjoy all of the offbeat characters, the narration,  and the romance between Nolte and Winger.  The ""dance"" scene is  my favorite.  If you enjoyed ""Bringing up Baby"" with  Hepburn/Grant, ""Going South"" with Jack Nicholson or ""While  You Were Sleeping"", you'll enjoy this.",946339200,5,438,4.597402597402597

384877,3,6301966465,"As much as I like a good Steinbeck novel turned into a good movie - from Grapes Of Wrath; East Of Eden; to Of Mice And Men - CANNERY ROW falls into the category of not done so well.
The best thing about this is the CANNERY ROW poor town, California coast sets.
The Cannery has shut down because the sardines are no more.
The few that remain are hopeless and eccentric but seem to come together to help the new girl in town hook up with local eccentric favorite, ex baseball player turned marine biologist.
Nick Nolte and Debra Winger as the struggling-couple to be(?) keep this comedy drama above water, barely.
M Emmet Walsh is pretty much not funny in a semi, comic relief eccentric-zany roll.

The one not mentioned in the media is ""Sweet Thursday"", which is in some ways even better than Cannery Row.  Together they make a really fun story.

385169,3,6301966465,As a fan of 'Cannery Row' and 'Sweet Thursday' the movie was a bit too 'cutesy'. Steinbeck would roll over in his grave.

Nolte became one of my favs. since Rich Man/Poor Man. He plays a similar character most of the time but it works for him best. Debra Winger was great. A movie the is blissful ... folks that just don't want the limelight in life and find a place that is off the beaten track.

The sets are surreal its look like they use an huge indoor studio for cannery row screen having the crash of the waves with Nick Nolte as a small part of the grand design of thing is breath taking. I get a warm fuzzy felling and let the real world slide away. While the casting of Nick Nolte and Debra Winger and the boys did an outstanding job, it was Frank McRae who added a lot magic to the move. Debra Winger in those simple dress and with her look could do a burn down on you.

Steinbeck's compassion shines through in this film.  He values the members of the then Cannery Row ""bunch"" rather than portraying them as the outcasts they would have been considered outside that scenario.  He sees through to the core of each human being rather than catering to societal norms, accepting these people for who they are.  Steinbeck's characters are not ""status quo"" .  They are flesh and blood people who have to survive and do what they can to do so.  Some people would never consider going into certain professions but these characters do and it's O.K.

All of that makes for an interesting evening of watching people act normally in situations that are not so normal in a period setting.

The narration was an asset, nice location shots, great story. This movie is pure entertainment and that's what I pay for. No save the whales, no vote Obama, no we're all going to burn.

I was disappointed in the complete transformation of the plot of the story.  While there were some good scenes of Mack and the boys, most of the movie plot did not even exist in the novel.

As the movie begins, the words on the screen say it is based on Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday.  The movie should have been titled Sweet Thursday, as it follows that plot much more closely than Cannery Row.  Also, while the movie is rated PG, I thought it was inappropriate for a high school setting.",1418688000,,619,4.442477876106195

386399,1,6301966465,"I am a lifelong Steinbeck fan, and Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday are two of his masterpieces, capturing quirky characters and earthy wisdom in comical and romantic scenes. I got this movie expecting it to vary from the books while honoring the themes and the characters. I was sorely wrong.

It's hard to believe that the director or screenwriter had any true respect for what Steinbeck was communicating in these stories. Instead of treating Mack, for example, as a street poet and diplomat, he is portrayed as an alcoholic buffoon. The music, the acting, and even the movie sets give this a slapstick quality. Steinbeck never glosses over his characters faults, yet shows them to be wise in ways that many university-trained people will never understand. And apparently, in ways that this director failed to understand.

Despite a few attempts to capture Doc and Suzy's relationship correctly, the rest of the movie bogs it down and turns it into a laughingstock. What a shame. I hope someday Steinbeck's classics will be captured on film by someone who appreciates what he did for the common man and woman. He was not making fun of these people. He was giving them dignity, despite their idiosyncrasies. This is one movie that should have been canned before it ever left the shelf.",1410048000,,1285,4.889908256880734

This novel turned movie is an upbeat story about a down-and-out former baseball pitcher turned marine biologist and his unlikely companion, a young lady who wanders into town as a newcomer wanting a job as a waitress and ending up in the only cathouse in the community. Set near Steinbeck's native Salinas, California, the action takes place in a former tuna canning town gone defunct in the Depression. The supporting characters lend it an unusual flavor, with Steinbeck's trademark character with a slow mind in the form of Hazel, and his entourage all acting as the marine biologist's (Doc's) foils.

The screenplay by David Ward was both a homage to John Steinbeck and a superb interpretation of the novels ""Cannery Row"" and ""Sweet Thursday.""  Nick Nolte and Debra Winger got it, as did everyone else involved with the production. The film is a timeless triumph. The reviewers at the time didn't get it, but why would they? They never have and probably never will.

The characterizations by the entire cast are, to me, flawless, and the score and narration by John Huston set just the right tone.  Winger and Nolte will define the characters of Suzy (sp?) and Doc in my mind for life.  The film captures Steinbeck's humor brilliantly.",1405296000,,425,4.794520547945205

386472,3,6301966465,"If you don't know Steinbeck's beloved novels, Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday, you will find this a sweet, amusing film with some great character actors. Nick Nolte and Debra Winger have great chemistry on screen, and you just know they'll end up together, happily ever after.

However, that's not the story that Steinbeck wrote. Cannery Row is a deceptively simple novel, a series of tales of Doc Ricketts, marine biologist at Western Biological Laboratory, and the denizens of the downtrodden canning district in Monterey that has seen better days. Mack and the Boys, Lee Chong, Dora the Madam, and others all seem to revolve around Doc, who is the unofficial mayor of the depressed cannery row area. The sardine canning plants are declining, and it's a smelly, dangerous way to make a living. Many are down on their luck, either by choice or chance, but most are survivors, getting by, running a scam, looking out for each other. There are many amusing tales in the book, but there's a dark, serious side too - people killed, people committing suicide, other unexplained deaths and accidents. All the characters are somehow damaged or lonely, looking for human connections.

The book is organized around the very simple premise that Mack and the Boys decide to reward Doc's many kindnesses to them by throwing him a party. In order to do that, they go on a frog hunt to gather frogs to sell them to the Chinaman and earn the money to buy the party supplies. But everything Mack does turns out badly, and this time is no exception. He spends the rest of the book trying to make amends to Doc for the botched effort. But even this fundamental plot line is mangled in the film adaptation. Though the essence of the frog hunt remains in the movie, and is quite hysterical, many other aspect surrounding the frog hunt are omitted. Most of the dark side of the story is omitted, and The Chinaman, Lee Chong, was changed into a Mexican ! The Palace Flophouse, occupied by Mack and the Boys, is missing and they hang out in a series of old pipes and junk heaps. The Bear Flag Restaurant (aka house of ill repute) is far too grand in scale and furnishings as compared to what is depicted in the novel.

There are many puzzling omissions and changes in the screenplay, but what is mainly missing from the film adaptation is Steinbeck's wonderful language.

""Cannery Row in Monterey in California is a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream. Cannery Row is the gathered and scattered, tin and iron and rust and splintered wood, chipped pavement and weedy lots and junk heaps, sardine canneries of corrugated iron, honky tonks, restaurants and whore houses, and little crowded groceries, and laboratories and flophouses. Its inhabitants are, as the man once said, 'whores, pimps, gamblers, and sons of bitches,' by which he meant Everybody. Had the man looked through another peephole he might have said, 'Saints and angels and martyrs and holy men,' and he would have meant the same thing.""  Steinbeck's description of the pearl gray light in a Monterey morning is simply breathtaking. There is an omniscient narrator in the film, and it would have been nice if some of Steinbeck's marvelous language made it into the script.

If you're a Steinbeck lover, you will be disappointed in this movie, which is actually a mash-up of both novels. If you don't know Steinbeck's writings, you will find it a pleasant story, but not particularly memorable.",1404259200,,3488,4.776119402985074
386473,5,6301966465,"This movie, from the casting, to the score, to the stage setting, to the story and, especially, John Huston's narration, should be in everyone's top five.  The dialogue is amazing.  A person could quote from this movie all day long.  Audra Lindley is a gem...as is M. Emmet Walsh and Frank McCrae.  Nick Nolte and Debra Winger had all-star performances, reminiscent of Hepburn and Grant in the Philadelphia Story.  Cannery Row is hilarious (if the dance scene with Nolte and Winger can't compete with the funniest scene from any Hollywood movie, I'll eat my hat!); but at its essence,  Cannery Row is a story of devotion and relationships.  I love movies and this one is one of my all-time favorites.  You won't be disappointed.  The ending is fabulous.  This movie should have won awards.

The cast is great, especially Nick Nolte and Debra Winger. The acting is superb. Narration by John Houston guides you through this short but sweet journey.

While the romance storyline between Nolte and Debra Winger is pleasant, I must confess that my favorite parts of the movie involve the gang, and their way of relating to ""Doc"" and the world he represents..truly delightful... and the dry wit that comes through Huston's resonant voice is the perfect vehicle for Steinbeck's beautiful use of words and imagery.

Speaking of imagery, during this most recent viewing I found myself thinking that the filter used on the camera created a ""foggy"" sense of fantasy - which helps to create a warm sensation of being wrapped in a blanket on a chilly evening, while someone entertains you with stories that most likely are not true, but in which you choose to believe are true - because of what it would mean about people and their capacity for compassion and acceptance.

386967,5,6301966465,"When the review count is 122 - 5 star reviews to 2 - 1 star reviews it should be understood that this is a crowd pleasing movie. Cannery Row is a mash up of the continuing story lines in Steinbeck's comic novels Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday. It comfortably captures the spirit of fun, offkilter, out of the mainstream - and bend the conventions comedy of the novels. Among the several things the movie offers that the book cannot is the brilliant, polyphonic lively New Orleans Jazz that only Dr. John can perform.

Against the purists who do not like bringing together these two books under one title, or who insist that the books are better one can only accept that these criticisms are valid and totally irrelevant.

The youngish Nick Nolte lives inside of Doc, the Marine biologist and spiritual heart of this retiring community, as if it was his second skin. Nolte achieves more with his crushed hat and facial expressions than most actors would attempt. Squeaky voiced Debra Winger is a natural for the inquisitive not entirely innocent love interest who invades this almost closed depression era non-traditional community. M. Emmet Walsh and Audra Lindley leading respectively the bums of Cannery Row and the floozies of the Bear Flag Restaurant provide to the ensemble, beautifully performed cast support . John Houston as narrator was always a classy touch and even his tone of voice captures the slightly off center humor of the entire piece.

Individual scenes such as the ""frog massacre"" and the subsequent frog-based shopping spree could have been made into an award-winning stand - alone film short.

Allowing for two of the more comically narrated  fight scenes in moviedom, this is another low-key brilliantly executed, very little happens, romantic comedy that provides me with exactly the kind of light entertainment I like.  The books were fun, I enjoyed reading them and probably will reread them again. The movie is as much fun and I may wear out this DVD.",1363651200,7,1979,4.910179640718563

I like this movie for the most part but to give it 4 of 5 stars seems just a little too much...I'm more inclined to go with 3.5.

Cannery row is a town full of very poor and quirky/simple-minded people in the town but they all have big hearts -- and I think it's all the ""big hearts"" that make this film one that people like.  Nick Nolte's character has one of the biggest hearts of all and it's hard not to be fond of him, and I think it's his fondness/acceptance and love of the others that makes you care about them too.  And ladies -- Nolte is VERY attractive in this movie.

Debra Winger comes to town looking for work (not knowing that the canneries went bust a few years earlier. The only job she can get is work at the whore house - and she's no good at it. But she's a gutsy looser - determined and strong even though life has dealt her one lousy hand after another...and she's just the perfect misfit for Nolte's kind heart.  However, it takes some gutsy intervention from the half-wits to get those 2 together in the end.

If you're expecting to be bowled over (as the 5-star reviews may set you up to expect) you may be disappointed. It's NOT a ""fabulous"" story (or set), no ""wow"" factor, no action or special effects and seems to be largely filmed on a studio set - it's kind of slow and simple...BUT it's a nice/pleasant movie overall.  If you have that in mind when you go to watch this movie, I think you'll probably enjoy it.",1350777600,,1446,4.213768115942029

This, Tortilla Flat and Travels With Charlie are my three favorite Steinbeck pieces.  While the movie takes liberty with the book, the narration by John Huston, as well as wonderful performances by Nick Nolte, Debra Winger, M Emmett Walsh and Audra Lindley, to name a few of the superb actors giving amazing performances, added to beautiful cinematography treat us to one of the best period pieces ever!

Steinbeck knew how to describe a scene in detail like almost no other writer, and translating his words to cinematic vision is about as close to perfect in this delightful movie as you can come.  This is one of his lightest stories and the texture of the times comes through as well as a portrait of human ability to adapt to some of the worst possible conditions, and still have a great time.

In The Grapes of Wrath and other stories of that era, Steinbeck show us pain, frustration and life's inequities.  These are masterpieces of a different nature.

Cannery Row is pure delight. It makes you want to download boogie-woogie music and dance!  The dance scene is one of the best pieces of shtick ever to grace a movie. It is just enough on the under-toned side to make it real, and real enough to embarrass us and make us chuckle over our own posturing and foibles.

""Srae der lsardinen"" (bzw. Cannery Row) ist eine unbeschreiblich schne, einfach wunderbar verfilmte Literaturvorlage aus dem Jahre 1982. Sie geht auf einen alten Roman von 1945 zurck. Geschrieben hatte diesen einst John Steinbeck. Seine Erzhlung und ihre Fortsetzung, wonniger Donnerstag (OT, sweet Thursday) kommen darin vor.

Die Regie fhrte hier David S. Ward (""King Ralph"", ""Mission - Rohr frei"") und die Hauptrolle als Doc, - dh. er stellt dabei, auf gewisse Art und Weise, einfach die Persnlichkeit einer realen Figur, nmlich Ed Ricketts dar, - spielte Nick Nolte (u.a. in ""nur 48 Stunden"", ""Under Fire"", Kap der Angst"", ""das Bankentrio"", ""und wieder 48 Stunden"").

Auer ihm ist auch noch Debra Winger (u.a. ""ein Offizier und Gentleman"", Staatsanwlte kt man nicht"") als Suzy mit von der Partie, - M. Emmet Walsh und Anne Lockheart bzw. viele andere, mehr oder weniger bekannte, Darsteller in ihren Nebenrollen.

- / -

Story: die Handlung von ""Strae der lsardinen"" ist im kalifornischen Monterey der 1920er bzw. 30er Jahre angesiedelt. ""Cannery Row"" - bedeutet frei bersetzt, im Grunde dasselbe, - und ist hier ganz einfach der Name einer Strae, in der sich seinerzeit die lsardinenfabriken der hauptschlich vom Fischfang lebenden Stdte befunden haben.

Die Geschichte beschreibt hauptschlich auch heitere Episoden des Leben's und zeigt einiges vom tglichen Treiben der einfachen Menschen rund um das Labor von Doc (Nick Nolte), dessen Figur, wie gesagt, dem echten Ed Ricketts angelehnt ist.

Hier haben wir z. B. Mack, den selbsternannten Anfhrer einer Bande von Pennern, Tagedieben und Gelegenheitsarbeitern. Fr ihn und seine Truppe besteht der Tag meit aus Baseball spielen, saufen, Frsche fr Geld fangen, herumlungern und sich gelegentlich mit halbstarken College Jungen prgeln.

Suzy DeSoto (Debra Winger), die Unschuld vom Lande. Ein garnicht mal wirklich naives, einfaches Mdchen, das hierhin auf der Suche nach dem besseren Leben kommt. Zuerst versucht sie sich dort als Animierdame bzw. Prostituierte, was Doc (der als einziger sowas wie Bildung zu haben scheint und einem halbwegs geregelten Tagesablauf nachgeht, - was ihn zur sehr respektierten und bei allen hoch angesehenen Figur macht) sich zwar in sie verlieben lt, er aber davon abgeschreckt wird ...

... erst spter, als sie das wieder aufgibt (richtig gut war sie ohnehin nicht darin), ldt er sie mal zum Essen und Tanzen ein und beide entdecken nun ihre Gefhle freinander.

Suzy, nun gereift, versucht es anschlieend, einem richtigen Job nachzugehen und wohnt in einem alten, riesigen Tank, den sie sich mit viel Improvisation eingerichtet hat.

Um beide zusammen kommen zu lassen bzw. das aus ihnen ein Paar wird, bemhen sich alle redlich, - u.a. wie gesagt, mit dem auftreiben von Frschen, um so z. B. Geld fr eine nette Party (zu dumm ist dabei allerdings, das Labor von Doc wird spter aber durch die besagte Prgelei mit den College Jungs erstmal komplett zerstrt), das romantische Dinner und deren Garderobe aufzutreiben.

Dann gibt es noch einen seltsamen Mann, der am Strand lebt, mit eingebildeten Leuten spricht, - von denen er glaubt, sie wrden ihn tglich mit Lebensmitteln versorgen, sich deshalb sonst keine Sorgen macht und dafr bei allen anderen einfach nur komplett verrckt erscheint.

Es stellt sich aber heraus, das ist ein Freund von Doc. Beide waren sie mal sehr vielversprechende Baseballspieler gewesen ... und ein Ball, der ihn am Kopf traf, geworfen von Doc, der sich deshalb Vorwrfe macht und ihn in Wahrheit mit Essen versorgt, verursachte bei ihm diese Strung.

""Strae der lsardinen"" erzhlt also alltgliche Dinge, beschreibt Menschen, die versuchen, mit der trostlosen Lebenssituation, ohne weitere Perspektiven, in der sie sich befinden, einfach nur zurecht zu kommen. Die optimistisch bleiben, das beste daraus zu machen.

Was smtlichen Darstellern auch berzeugend gelingt. Alle Jahre wieder wurde dieses wirklich extrem seltene, filmische Juwel mal im Fernsehen ausgestrahlt.

Auf Video ist er (zumindest in deutsch) leider nie erschienen, was ihn noch weniger bis kaum bekannt machen wird. Nun endlich gibt es ihn dafr auf DVD.

387125,5,6301966465,"I debated a little as to whether to give this 4 stars or 5 stars, I see the concensus is 4 1/2, so I guess I fall right in with the crowd. First, this is a combination of two Steinbeck works- Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday, and while it is based on both, don't expect it to precisely conform to the books. One point I would like to make along those lines, and may make now and then in my reviews, is that if you want every sentence and description to be directly out of the book, then read the book! Too often I read DVD reviews with very low ratings solely because they did not exactly match the book. DVDs will always have some interpretation, and certainly some omissions since there is rarely time enough to put all of a book on film. Back to the subject at hand- CANNERY ROW- I had this on VHS years ago, and was glad to see it is now on DVD. The acting is mostly excellent, with the supporting cast, especially Mac and the boys, offering as much as the stars. Reproduction of both visual and sound is good, though some graininess can be seen at times, it is not objectionable. The sets and costume design are adequate. The music, while not something I would typically listen to, fits the film perfectly. Bluesy horn at the right time, honky tonk piano at the right time. I feel this film also has a good balance of comedy and drama. John Huston's narrative, with his distinctive voice, adds a lot. IF I wanted to find fault, I would say that the film at times appears to be a series of smaller events, which might have been tied together a bit better, I personally did not find that objectionable, though. The ending was perhaps just a bit weak, I might have tried a couple of other bits with the camera, maybe had a slightly longer ending. The actors at the end (Nolte and Winger) seemed to have a bit less steam than they had earlier in the film. Don't let that stop you from watching this, though, it is too good overall, to miss.",1301356800,3,1939,4.257452574525745

The cinematography is spectacular, and the mood created is so very intimate.  One feels the bite of the depression and the relief as people assist each other through difficulty (perhaps a kinder time).  I don't think the movie needs to replicate the books, rather I believe it stands on its own.  This film should have won awards - I can't imagine how critics could have sat through the film on a large screen and not have been utterly charmed.  The music is evocative and the sets are amazing.  The characters drawn by each of the actors are pure Steinbeck at his best - and the actors at their best.  So glad it's finally on DVD.  Written by Jack's wife.",1292198400,2,772,4.34965034965035

387129,2,6301966465,"When I was stationed at the Presidio of Monterey early in the 1960s, before Cannery Row had become a major tourist destination, and there were still a few residents who could have stepped off the pages of Steinbeck's book, I loved visiting Cannery Row (to see movies in the art house theater there and to have an occasional beer at the Palace bar and grill). During my first week in the barracks, one of my 35 'roommates' handed me a well worn copy of Steinbeck's book and said 'Here. You ought to read this.' I read it and it immediately became one of my favorite books.

I eagerly looked forward to seeing the movie CANNERY ROW when it came out in the early 80's, but I was greatly disappointed when the movie turned out to be based mostly on the book Sweet Thursday rather than Cannery Row, and the extraordinarily interesting character Doc had been reduced to a retired baseball player, rather than the world-class marine biologist who authored the timeless classic BETWEEN PACIFIC TIDES, who ultimately inspired the creation of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and who loved to listen to Gregorian Chant and the music of J.S.Bach and William Byrd. (I first heard the etherial opening strains of Byrd's 'Mass for Five Voices' in the barracks at Monterey when a fellow soldier bought a recording of Byrd's music in order to know more about Doc's taste in music).

I also remember experiencing an unpleasant time warp when I recognized that some of the movie's incidental music was written in the same style as the sign-off music of the local TV station . . . from a third of a century later than when the book was written.  Finally, Doc's decision to get married at the end of the movie was jarringly abrupt, completely out of sync with the spirit of the book, and thoroughly out of character for Doc.  If some studio exec was demanding a happily-ever-after ending, it should have been Doc and Suzy going off on a road trip and ordering a beer milkshake with two straws.",1286841600,5,1967,4.611428571428571

Cannery Row is a very nontraditional movie, and even a little quirky.  It is sad, almost dark, but funny, and even thought provoking.  I mean have you ever tried a beer milkshake?  Have you ever wanted to run away and live someplace apart from the rest of society?  This movie featured a younger Nick Nolte and Debra Winger.  Their characters are attractive and a little sad.  I first watched this movie 25 years ago, and still enjoy it.  I watched it on vhs recently and today i am going to finally order the DVD.

The most important lession their relationship taught me is that of  contentment. Although they had very little, nothing really, they were HAPPY. You see people, being content with your life doesn't mean you have to have a Zillion things, the latest car and a home in the hills. There are a lot of unhappy people in the world who have it ""all"" and they are still not happy. Mack and the boys have nothing but the friendship and love of each other and they ARE happy.

The original Cannery Row stories were ok -- Sweet Thursday, the sequel, is excruciating.  You have to really be able to deal with the whore with the heart of gold stuff, Steinbeck at his worst.

However, the best thing about this movie by far is Debra Winger, who was at her most unbelievably, staggeringly, beautiful.  She plays the role as an impossible innocent/know-it-all -- a complete male fantasy.  But it doesn't matter, none of that matters.

Film director John Huston's tongue in cheek narration is, again, superb.  My congratulations to David Ward!  Much like, ""The Crying Game,"" but quite different, this film posseses a heart-felt poignancy that easily outshines all of its amusement. Any notion of refilming this excellent script; that is not quite John Steinbeck's, but rather, based on his characters and off-beat humor, would be akin to a notion of re-editing Brando's, ""Mutiny on the Bounty,"" to not include Brando, or re-editing, ""The Misfits,"" to not include Monroe and Gable.

387222,5,6301966465,"I saw Cannery Row when it was in theaters and have had a copy of the film first on VHS and now on DVD.  The screen play adapts two of John Steinbeck's books: Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday.  Although connected the mood of the novels is quite different with Cannery Row being grittier and realistic and Sweet Thursday more sentimental. Both books make great reading.  The film picks up more from Sweet Thursday and the character of Doc (based on marine biologist Ed Ricketts) has nothing to do with baseball in the novels.  It goes without saying that the character of the Seer, the injured baseball player, fits the screen play and not the novel.

That said, Cannery Row is a nice romantic comedy and the story is brought to life by the supporting cast as much as the leading actors Nick Nolte (as Doc) and Deborah Winger (as Suzy).  M. Emmet Walsh plays Mack, the leader of ""the boys,"" to perfection and the slow witted but physically strong Hazel (one of the boys) is marvelously played by Frank McRae. Audra Lindley plays Fauna, proprietor of the Bear Claw Hotel, otherwise known as the local house of ill-repute.  John Huston lends his distinctive voice to the narration.

Viewing it some twenty-five years on my response is that this is a nice film.  My only real criticism is that it drags on occasion but sails by on good vibes.  The film is populated with affable eccentrics that tug at your heart portayed by terrific character actors like M. Emmett Walsh, Audra Lindley, and Frank McCrae.

The movie does not have time to address all that information, but picks up within the Cannery Row story and moves swiftly through Sweet Thursday.

Nick Nolte was rugged enough to give a good performance of Doc and Debra Winger's character was endearing and ditzy enough so that they formed an opposite in characters who attracted each other to answer needs of loneliness within an aura of isolation.

387266,5,6301966465,"The film ""Cannery Row"" is one of my all time favorites! Yes, I have read the novel ""Cannery Row"" many times and I love it and I did read ""Sweet Thursday"" many years ago. I know to some what I am about to say would seem sacrilegious, but I actually feel that this film improved the story of ""Cannery Row"". It gave the character ""Doc"" a love interest which helps to round out the story and made the whole flow of the story much, much better, omitting only parts of the book which were relatively minor. I especially appreciated the omission of the large number of deaths which took place in the first half of the book. In the film they would have just made the tone of the story wayyyyy too dark! I also like the amalgamation made with several characters in the book into one or two characters in the film and even the changing of some characters such as store owner ""Lee Chong"" into ""Joseph and Mary"" (one male character!). For one thing, I just can't see ""Lee Chong"" dressed up like Dracula. I also love the history made for ""Doc"" in the film (which is not in the book), about his having been a potentially great pro baseball player who quits at a young age, and his connection to the character ""The Seer"", in the film. One of my favorite scenes from the film which was in the novel was the wonderful scene of fulfilling the legend of the ""Beer Milkshake"" and ""Doc`s"" reaction after tasting it. All in all, the book is like the film but just gives us more background to certain events in the film and the film adds some things to the story, which while not intended by John Steinbeck, still brings the story more depth and flavor.

The film has perfect casting! There isn't a single actor's performance that isn't simply wonderful. There are many standout performances in this film. I have never been a big fan of most of Nick Nolte's work, but I truly can't see anyone else but him portraying ""Doc"". He's superb and strikes just the right tone of an educated man of science living in a place where he is surrounded by mostly uneducated salt-of-the-earth types. Debra Winger brings exactly the kind of feistiness, vulnerability and sexiness needed by the role of ""Suzy"". Even here voice, which can be a bit high pitched when she is excited, is in itself endearing in this setting. M. Emmet Walsh as the chief bum ""Mack"" who has been in countless movies as a supporting actor gives one of his finest performances here. Walsh brings a harmless abrasiveness to the role while still making him thoroughly likable. Frank McRae as the strong but mentally challenged ""Hazel"" brings a heartwarming innocence to the role which was different from the way ""Hazel"" is written in the book. I prefer the film ""Hazel"". The addition of the plot thread where ""Hazel"" is convinced by a psychic reading that he is destined to become the President of the United States and the subsequent anguish this causes him always warms my heart and makes me smile. The town Madame and owner of the Bear Flag Restaurant brothel, who in the book is called Dora but in the film is called Fauna who is based upon a real Madame named Flora, is precisely played by Audra Lindley. She has the ""flaming orange hair"" and plays the flamboyant style but earthy wisdom of the character to a ""T"". Another great performance is from Sunshine Parker who portrays the character of  ""The Seer"" in the film. He might be a bit old for the role, in comparison to ""Doc"", but he brings a sweetness to the role that makes one smile and makes me cry every time I see the scene near the end of the film. Also, I would agree that, most of the time, narration in a film can be a bit annoying (example: original theatrical release of ""Blade Runner""!) and can draw away from the film, but not in this case. In this film you have the wonderful avuncular voice of the great John Huston, the actor/director. He mixes in just enough narration to the film to make it comforting but not annoying. In fact, after I saw this movie the first time from then on when I read the ""Cannery Row"" novel I  hear John Huston's voice in my head when I read the narrative of the book. For that matter the same goes for all the other similar characters between the book and film too!

The Direction of the film was extremely well done by David S. Ward and he deserves a great deal more credit and recognition for this film than has ever been accorded to him.

As far as the sets and scenery in the film, anyone who has lived in a fishing village knows how accurate the sets and scenery were are in this film. I have never lived in Monterey, California but I have lived in or frequently visited many fishing towns along the coast of Oregon, such as Bandon, Newport, Charleston and Coos Bay, and every time I watch this film it is like coming home to those places.

The music of the film is perfect. Mostly jazz and swamp boogie piano, much of which was played by the great jazz pianist Dr. John, along with some finely chosen classical pieces brings a great flavor to the film and helps the viewer even further in feeling they are transported back to that time.

Finally, it is a special kind of film that makes you wish you lived in an economically depressed, industrialized town that stinks like dead fish and where you live around professional bums and a whorehouse! I've lived in similar places and watching this film always gives me the yearning to go back to those towns. Many people who like or even love this film have said that it is one of the most underrated and under-recognized films in movie history and I couldn't agree more! This film deserved many Oscar's which it didn't receive. I have been waiting for years and years for this film to finally be released on DVD and I am thrilled beyond words to see that my wish is finally going to come true! I transferred my VHS copy to DVD-R a couple of years ago so that my tape wouldn't deteriorate any further but the original VHS release was always substandard and of poor quality. It was in full screen and when the transfer was made they didn't even properly center the picture, so even bits of the opening credits are cut off at the edge of the screen. I hope this will be a Widescreen release which this film so desperately needs and deserves so we can see the film finally as the Director intended it to be seen. I think it will help bring this wonderful film to the attention of a whole new generation of film lovers and bring it the recognition it has missed in the passed.

387336,5,6301966465,"Edwin said: Tom Keogh's Editorial Review of this delightful movie does it a huge injustice, and if you take his word for it, does you one as well.

It is absolutely true!  This movie is incredibly fun.  Every segment in it offers a new set of surprises and character developments that entertain and delight the viewer.  The frog hunt--totally classic.  The narration?  Just fantastic.  If a typical Will Farrell movie makes you laugh like mad, you're probably going to miss out on the more intellectually beneficial elements of this movie.  This movie is comedy for thinking persons.

This movie features brand-name stars with so much to offer:

M. Emmet Walsh is dead-on as the happy-go-lucky Mack, who plays a ""leader"" of the ""boys"" who are basically a set of misfits and unkepts who each bring laughs for their individual personality traits that are revealed as the movie plays.  My favorite ""Mack"" scene is when he proudly offers ""Doc"" the present that all of the boys (and girls!) put-in together for the purchase of a new ""microscope.""  I won't totally spoil it, but see the movie and you'll know exactly what I mean about comedy at its finest!

Frank McRae's character Hazel will have you bent over backwards, sides in stitches.  You can't play that character at that level without being a top-notch and definitely under-appreciated talent.  (Frank McRae, who is featured in many great comedies, was Lieutenant Dekker in the movie The Last Action Hero.)

Audra Lindley, who played the madam (Fauna) of a ""house of ill-repute,"" was perfect!  She is probably better known to many as Mrs. (Helen) Roper in the Three's Company sitcom.  My favorite part is when she does a ""reading"" of the stars for Hazel (Frank McRae) that predicts that he will become the president of the USA.  His misfortune is inevitable!

This is, in my sincerest opinion, Debra Winger's best role ever.  She plays Suzy--a not too-excited by the occupation--prostitute employed by Fauna (Lindley), but becomes mutually-sweet on Nick Nolte's character, ""Doc"" in what amounts to a contest of one-ups-manship during a dance.

Nolte went on to play in the 48-Hours roles, but was absolutely excellent as Doc in this film.  His entire acting career, his staple of emotions and his ability to portray them through his craft are finely reflected in this film.

This movie has all of it! (minus the explicit language/sex that seems to be a requirement for movies these days)  It is a love story.  It is a story about love of a community, a people and their characters and interactions.  One of my favorite scenes is when the ""girls"" play a game of baseball against ""the boys"" and the ""Seer"" steps up to the plate.  It is a revealing and telling moment for all of us watching.  In that one moment, we are cascaded with a showering of bliss, envy, pain, suffering, remorse and even glee.  These kinds of mixed-emotional moments are incredibly rare in film.  This movie is probably the best of its genre to ever come out of studio mayham.

If you haven't seen this movie, you owe it to yourself to see it.  This movie is definitely not your typical, studio-safe recipe film.  You will love it, particularly if you think that Will Farrell's best movie was ""Stranger Than Fiction.""

Take Care.

387337,5,6301966465,"Cannery Row is so underrated it's pathetic!  The main reason for this - and the fact that it hasn't been released to DVD -  are the lawsuits that flew when Raquel Welch was replaced by Debra Winger as Suzy.  She just wasn't working-out in the part and MGM was locked-up in court for years tryiong to resolve this and even now, it's doubtful that this film will see a second-life on DVD.  Not to slight Ms. Welch but it's hard to imagine anyone inhabiting the role of ""Suzy"" better than Debra Winger in 1982.  She is completely believable in her part - as are the rest of the actors in this ensemble piece.

That's why you can't currently find it on DVD - but about the movie ....

The world David Ward creates is an insulated community in a crazy world.  The citizens of Cannery Row aren't really losers or people who have given up on life - they've just got a different take on it.  Sure, ""Doc"" is running from an accident that stalled his ballplaying career and you never really know the origins of others like Hazel, Mack and Eddie, but that's minor considering the simple beauty of the film.  It's a leisurly ""stroll"" and John Huston's beautiful voiceover just adds to the mood.  While it could be considered a ""love story"", there are too many other stories going on to limit it to that.  Mack's scheme to get money by capturing frogs is a masterpiece of pacing!  And Hazel's simple-minded view of life makes sense in their world.  For me, some of the most touching scenes belonged to ""The Seer"", played to perfection by Sunshine Parker.

But again, this movie isn't necessarily meant to have a linear thread to a logical conclusion - it's a slice out of these people's eccentric lives and through the interweaving of stories - and again, Huston's beautiful narration - it makes Cannery Row a great place to spend some time.  Try to watch it and NOT want to try a beer milk shake!  Or adopt wearing a snap-brim Stetson a la ""Doc"".

It's a crime that this film has been tied-up in legalities for so long but I still hold out hope that one day it will be released - with commentary by Nolte, Ward, M. Emmett Walsh, and anyone else who would like to be involved - and then the world will once again move in greased grooves........",1204156800,2,2231,4.426470588235294

The set and the staging are a bit over the top but that serves to take the edge off of the story and to make for a carefree viewing experience.  The characters in this movie are portrayed charmingly and the narration, by John Huston no less, gives a non-judgemental backdrop to the story.  It's easy to see the characters as nice folks doing their best even though the world at large would not necessarily see them in such benign terms.  Such is the charm of Steinbeck's writing and the portrayal in this film stays right in the spirit of it all.

Another thing that I really appreciate in this film is the music.  Throughout the film there is a backround of old blues played tastefully on a trumpet that blows in and out of various scenes like a refreshing breeze.  You don't necessarily miss it when it's absent but you certainly appreciate it while it's happening.  Beyond that, the music is period-correct for the story being told without sounding hokey or old-fashioned.

Debra Winger and Nick Nolte work well in their roles, two people dealing with less than perfect circumstances and managing to preserve their identities.

All in all Cannery Row is a gentle ride.  A movie that deals with some potentially volatile subject matter with grace and dignity.

I kept watching this film over the years, whenever it was on TV, and always found something new, something sweet, something magical, that I hadn't seen before, and some technique I'd like to steal if I ever made a movie... So many critics complain that American movies are too contrived, that they are too obvious, and that they have no layers. This one is, to me, what all those critics claim they want -- and they trashed it. It is a superb example of what America is (or, perhaps, was), with haunting, silly, warm moments. I was inspired to read every Steinbeck book, and then most of them again, specifically because of this movie. No, it's not exactly like ""Cannery Row"" or ""Sweet Thursday"", but the hearts of those books and the world Steinbeck wrote about are there, and I don't think movies should be merely books in motion.

Who gives a darn if it follows Steinbeck exactly... This movie stands on its own as an outstanding adaptation.... and one of the very few that retains the feel of the material it's based upon.

Perhaps my lack of expertise in the directing department has allowed me to hold this movie close to my heart despite the flaws Mr. Keogh has focused on.

The story is based in a town where the main business has shut down years ago, and all that's left are people with nowhere else to go - what do you want, an action packed movie?  It seems so obvious to me that the director was shooting for this; there's a narrator (John Huston), whose voice is like Tom Bodett from Motel 6, there's plenty of slow drag background music, it's kind of obvious what they're going for...  And it's wonderful.
If you love the book, you may be dissapointed in some of the plot differences, but that seems to be common in most movie versions of books.

As others have said, this movie may have its differences from the TWO books it's based upon (a comment in the credits indicates it is based upon both 'Cannery Row' and 'Sweet Thursday'), but for capturing the spirit and feel of that particular place and time it is nothing short of superb.  Huston's narration is inspired, the sets have a heightened reality that echoes the keen observations seen in Steinbeck's novels, and the fantastic soundtrack adds to the almost mystical mood of the Row.
As for the actors, the usually gruff Nolte shows a vulnerability missing in his other movies.  Winger absolutely shines as a waif lost in the big world.  Finally, Mac and crew (""I and the boys"") are great as the eyes, ears, and even conscience of the close knit little community where these memorable folks all live.
For those who continue to quibble, there are indeed some additions to the books' cast of characters as well as scenes not drawn directly from the novels.  But for anyone who doesn't take a jaundiced view of things, these serve more to enhance the Steinbeck feeling than to salve some actor's or director's ego.",1029110400,7,1284,4.609649122807017

387531,4,6301966465,"....
Cannery Row is a delightful film, but doesn't have much to do with Steinbeck's novel.
The characters, for the most part, are there, although there would be no part for Debra Winger in the novel. Nick Nolte isn't a good match physically for the Doc in the novel, but his portrayal is right on target. M. Emmet Walsh captures the essence of Mack, but again, perhaps not a good physical match. Casting Frank McRae as Hazel is a bit of a stretch, although McRae turns in a brilliant performance.
The story itself, as presented in the film, is only reminiscent of the novel.  The Debra Winger character in the film doesn't exist in this novel, but appears in a later novel called ""Sweet Thursday"".  In fact, much of what is shown in Cannery Row the movie has been gleaned from ""Sweet Thursday.""
While much of the charm from the novel is lost in the film, the film offers up much charm on its own. The settings are stylized, giving the film a feel of fantasy rather than reality. Some may find fault in this but the stagy sets seem to make the film more romantic.
The music that haunts us throughout the film may not be quite timely to the period, but is appropiate in tone and is a joy to hear. It is as much a part of the mood of the film as the visual approach.
Perhaps the best ""casting"" in the film is having John Huston provide the narration. While much of the text did not come from the novel, it is brilliantly done.
Today's audiences may find the film ""slow moving."" This is something to be savored, though, and any other pacing would destroy the enjoyment. The world, and Cannery Row especially, moved to a different beat than today's world. Sit back and let the leisurely pace take you back to a simpler time.

I note that Amazon's critic didn't like the movie's pace, but it seemed to me to be true to Steinbeck's writing.  Read Cannery Row or Tortilla Flat, and you'll see that Steinbeck's rhythms - and those of the people of whom he writes - are faithfully reproduced.  Look elsewhere for your taut thriller.

With its world of highly screwed up folks, it puts me in mind of -- well, try to imagine  a warm and fuzzy version of The Iceman Cometh.

After it ended, I had the same sour feeling I've had after seeing several so-alleged adaptations of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer:  Why didn't they just make the book into a screenplay, rather than inventing additional story elements, changing the characters, switching the plot around and so forth?  It makes one think that Hollywood writers are so self-important, they always believe they can improve upon the works of Mark Twain, John Steinbeck and other literary greats.

387590,5,6301966465,"Some of you will remember when, if a broadcast movie wasn't quite long enough to fill a 2-hour time slot, the network would occasionally show a ""Making of..."" short.  Nowadays, these shorts are relegated to the 'E' channel, which builds whole 'Coming Attractions' programs around them.
In any case, that's how I was first exposed to this movie.  I was charmed by the comments of a little known Debra Winger and Nick Nolte about their characters and the development of their on-screen romance.  I was also impressed with the filmmaker's effort to recreate the Cannery Row of the 1930's, on a soundstage.
No, it doesn't look like ""real life"".  It's not a recreation of real life!  It's a recreation of real life - as filtered through the author's imagination.  I'm sure Ed Ricketts was a wonderful friend to John Steinbeck, but never quite as colorful and endearing as the pictures painted in his stories.
Granted also, the baseball pitcher subplot didn't exist in either 'Cannery Row' nor 'Sweet Thursday', but it's very effective in illustrating the movie's central theme.  Which is, that like ourselves, these characters are always dealing with everything else which took place in their lives, prior to this moment in time.  We can either run and hide from our past, or face it and embrace our lives for what they have - and may - become.
Like others, I'd love to see this movie available on DVD.  Maybe then they'd include Dr. John's wonderful soundtrack, and I'd be able to see 'The Making of Cannery Row' short again.
