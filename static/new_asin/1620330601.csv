8631099,5,1620330601,"This is a wonderful, informative book. I'd never tried these techniques before and love the results. I learned how to easily manipulate digital photos and print them onto textured or embellished fabric as well as how to make acrylic ""skins"" and to collage on them. I learned about InkAid products and ways to add metallic sheens and highly textured pastes to fabric. I recommend this fun book.",1529539200,,393,4.880597014925373
