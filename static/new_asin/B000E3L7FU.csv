8307721,5,B000E3L7FU,I use the hoop full size for a regular workout for 45 min and change and take out a rung and do the smaller size hoop for 20-25 min for a more active workout - I even took it apart and put it in my suitcase with me on my vacation last month - it travels well!!!  I have lost over 25 lbs so far and it is so easy to do - do it while watching tv!!!,1322179200,,346,3.4358974358974357
8307722,1,B000E3L7FU,"I purchased this kit from Amazon rather than through the manufacturer. The DVD is unreadable and without the DVD, the hoop itself is useless. Amazon does not respond to any inquiries about replacing the DVD. The kit is available from at least a dozen other online stores. My advice is to research prices on Amazon, but purchase product elsewhere.",1149984000,20,346,4.88135593220339
