6568240,3,B00MEEVVV2,Good movie,1409443200,,10,4.5
6568241,4,B00MEEVVV2,"The works of famed crime novelist Elmore Leonard are a popular source for directors looking to dip their toes in the genre, but few are able to fully capture the author's snappy narrative voice. A few managed to get it right; Quentin Tarantino with Jackie Brown and Steven Soderbergh's sexy Out of Sight, and some would probably say Get Shorty although for me that film has always been somewhat overrated. Dan Schechter, whose last film was the lively indie, Supporting Characters, brings that same creative energy to Life of Crime, easily the best Leonard adaptation since Out of Sight steamed up theaters sixteen years ago.

The background on this one is as twisty as one of Leonard's plots, although knowing the history isn't necessary to enjoy the madcap criminal shenanigans at play. Seeing as Leonard's book, The Switch, is the inspiration, and is a prequel to Rum Punch, which Tarantino adapted into Jackie Brown; Life of Crime follows the early exploits of characters we already know pretty well. Yasiin Bey (formerly Mos Def) and John Hawkes are the young Ordell and Louis (played by Samuel L. Jackson and Robert De Niro in Jackie Brown), and the petty crooks have happened upon their next ""get rich quick"" scheme. That eerily familiar plan involves kidnapping Mickey (Jennifer Aniston) the socialite wife to rich Detroit businessman Frank Taylor (Tim Robbins), and scoring a hefty ransom. But the duo, who we know will have a long history of not thinking things through, didn't bother to research their target. It seems that Frank has been skipping town often under the guise of business trips, when he's actually down in Florida vacationing with his mistress, Melanie (Isla Fisher, played by Bridget Fonda in Jackie Brown), who he plans to marry.

So what does that mean for their hopes of extorting $1M in cold cash to return Mickey to her ""loving"" husband""? It means things are only going to get more complicated, especially as Mickey comes to realize that her supposedly wedded bliss may not be all she thought it was. As her relationship with the clearly-smitten Louis deepens, tensions arise between the two old buddies when Ordell begins to suspect the jig has been compromised. Does he trust his friend to see their scheme through to the end? What if things get ugly and there needs to be violence? The question of just how far Louis is willing to go proves to be the film's driving force, with Hawkes turning in yet another terrific performance. Those used to De Niro's later portrayal may take a little time getting used to Hawkes' quirkier approach, but by the end of the film you can see how and why Louis evolves as he does. Hawkes and Aniston trade barbs and emotional exchanges in equal measure, and while they have good chemistry together comedically they don't share much in romantic chemistry. Schechter, who wrote the script on spec in hopes Leonard would approve (he did obviously), has his sights set on laughs rather than stirring up passion. The film's best bits are the funny ones, and many of them center on Mark Boone Junior as Richard, a racist, Nazi-loving dufus (he likes Ordell, though, just enough) who can't get anything right. He's stupid but dangerous, and when the stakes suddenly ramp up it's because of his dim-witted actions. Ultimately, it's Mickey's beauty that becomes the biggest obstacle as Will Forte plays a wimpy friend whose crush on her threatens to blow the plan up before it's even started. Schechter leans hard on the '70s soundtrack and authentically dated outfits, perfectly fitting for the era even if they seem a little weird on the decidedly modern Aniston.

As much fun as Life of Crime turns out to be it does struggle to conjure up fresh surprises due to the familiarity of a plot we've seen far too often. The characters keep it light and engaging, a testament to the strength of Leonard's writing and Schechters direction. The author himself may be gone, but as long as enjoyable films like Life of Crime are out there his work will endure.",1409443200,25,4011,4.8270348837209305
6568242,3,B00MEEVVV2,"A serviceable light-fare caper nowhere in the same league as, e.g., Get Shorty (also by Elmore Leonard).

From that point, the flick becomes a comedy of errors, as the crew is suspect, the plans hit some snags and the crooks are in danger of losing control. From 'chuckles to laugh out loud' moments, this film adaptation of Elmore Leonard's ""The Switch"" gives the audience a run for its money as the excellent cast really seem to be enjoying the script. Starring Jennifer Aniston as Mickey, the object of everyone's desires; Tim Robbins as the husband; Yasiin Bey (aka music artist Mos Def) and John Hawkes as the planners. Also, featuring Isla Fisher, Will Forte, and Mark Boon Junior in a hoot of a role. Aniston excels at these funny roles; Bey and Hawkes are a superb team, and Robbins keeps everything firmly grounded as he makes wild decisions.

6568692,4,B00MEEVVV2,"With John Hawkes, Yasiin Bey, Tim Robbins, and Jennifer Anniston and other fine actors in the cast, how can you go wrong?

Although the story has its share of humor (mainly handled by Mark Boone Junior as a Nazi) and suspense (will Bey, Robbins, and the treacherous Melanie, played by Isla Fisher, succeed in killing or maiming Anniston's character?), it's not as crazy or violent as, say, ""Fargo"" or ""The Professional"" (the Gary Oldman/Natalie Portman movie). I love those two movies, but they don't set some kind of new standard of excess that every movie has to meet. Not every director is the Coen brothers; not every actor is Gary Oldman. If you're so jaded you can't appreciate ""Life of Crime,"" stop going to see action movies!

I gave the movie a ""4"" because for me a movie has to be a serious drama or a comedy you can watch many times before it can earn an 5. A solid 4 is a good rating for a story whose purpose is entertainment.",1445644800,,939,4.453488372093023

Aniston's character is kidnapped by a gang, and they want a million dollars in ransom. Unknown to them is that her husband, Frank, played by Tim Robbins is about to divorce her. He has a little chippie played by Isla Fisher, and she thinks they will marry. The gang, takes good care of her, except for the crazy, Mark Boone, a Nazi crazy.

The film shows the late 1970's well. Aniston's mansion home is well laid out. Lots of surprises in this film as Leonard Is known to give. Lots of twists and turns and in the end is the biggest surprise. Humor is alive in this film, and Will Forte plays a role that has served him well.

Can't care about the characters so it doesn't really matter what happens to them. Jennifer Aniston's character shows some bravery, ingenuity and fight at first, but she ends up like all the rest of the characters--selfish and nihilistic. Ick. Throw in a couple of short, but completely gratuitous, sex scenes, and it adds up to a complete waste of time. I can't believe I watched it, but I kept thinking, ""it's got to get better.""

The movie started off slow and awkward but gained steam once the kidnapping took place. Unfortunately, what could have been a really great film got bamboozled in the post-production department.

There were several spots where it became apparent that filming was done with a ""green screen"" type backdrop instead of outside, and boy you could tell instantly. The overlay was absolutely horrible, perhaps made worse by the 70's type gloss of the film (I don't know how they do that part, so it's just a guess). In any case, for me the worst part was the music. Great music, but horrible, horrible mismatch in terms of placement. The songs simply do not match the scenes with very few exceptions.

6569859,3,B00MEEVVV2,"2013 movie with Jennifer Aniston in the lead role as a socialite who gets kidnapped by a couple of unprepared and bumbling ex-cons.  Although slated primarily as a comedy, LIFE OF CRIME is a pedestrian and mostly unimaginative spin on an old plot, with some competent acting but too many lulls and too much uninspired dialog to make it truly compelling.  As a ""comedy"" LIFE OF CRIME fails miserably, but occasionally captures that Elmore Leonard spirit with a heavy dose of absurdity and a few obvious bad guy pratfalls aimed at eliciting a chuckle.

Far from Aniston's most accomplished work (she plays it straight) this is John Hawkes' film, with his characterization of Louis (the kidnapper) both believable and sympathetic.  His craggy, everyman features deliver a stunning counterpoint to the lovely Aniston but their ""relationship"" is organic and the highlight of the film.  Tim Robbins, as Aniston's morally bankrupt husband who thinks twice when considering whether to ransom his wife (he's conveniently filed for divorce), is a scene-eating stitch.

Over all, LIFE OF CRIME is a pleasant diversion and well acted, but don't expect a knee slapper.",1434412800,,1155,5.149732620320855

6569873,2,B00MEEVVV2,"The plan was simple, kidnap a rich suburban woman, while her husband and son are out of town. The husband is corrupt, so he will be more than willing to pay a ransom, in order to keep them quiet, and to get his wife back, right? This group of bumbling, life-long criminals thought they had it all figured out, except for one small problem, Frank Dawson (Tim Robbins) isn't really interested in getting his wife back. This strange film, based on the novel, Switch by Elmore Leonard, takes place in the late 70's, and had critics raving, but after seeing it for myself, I'm left with one question, why? After the kidnapping takes place, the film moves at a snails pace, with criminals arguing, and phone calls back and fourth, nothing happens for the majority of the film. Jennifer Aniston stars and gives probably the worst performance I've ever seen her give. She is this spoiled, whiny, rich b****, who just doesn't know when to keep her mouth shut. It really got to the point where every time she spoke I cringed. On the other hand, Tim Robbins, who plays her husband, was hilarious, but not in the film nearly enough. One of my favorite young actors, Charlie Tahan, also has a role in the film, as their son. In the brief amount of screen time he has, we see a very troubled and confused kid, an angle that could have helped the story, but he too was hardly used. The majority of the film features Jennifer Aniston interacting with her kidnappers and trying to form a bond with the bumbling idiots. I'm not sure if this was supposed to be a comedy or just a comedy of errors wrapped up in a dramatic theme, but either way it doesn't work. Most of the cast is absolutely horrible, the majority of the film is unbelievably slow, and the parts that aren't, just don't make a whole lot of sense. Life of Crime had quite a few side stories that could have been utilized to fill up the space and break up the monotony, but it was all left on the cutting room floor, leaving us with a film that could be used as a method of torture at Guantanamo Bay.",1432512000,2,2046,4.386842105263158
6569874,4,B00MEEVVV2,"I have had a hard time finding good films recently.  It seems that the script needed one more rewrite before being shot.  The story was very nice though not real original- think: ""Ruthless People"".  Characterization made you like the main characters or dislike them because of personality traits- but they were never lifeless cardboard characters, they had some substance.
  ""Life of Crime"" had all of the qualities that you'd expect from a big budget film- Camera work, lighting, back drops, acting, directing,  ect.
  Plot:  Woman is kidnapped for one million dollars.  Her husband was tired of her anyway, and had filed for divorce.  So this will kill two birds, with no alimony.  He has a mistress of whom he was planning on marrying, anyway.
  That is what brings the fly into the ointment.  The mistress is a conniving gold digger and sees opportunities to tweak the  situation to her advantage.  This movie is very much on the level of films like: ""The Whole 9 Yards""  and ""Gunshy"".",1432425600,,989,4.820359281437126

Jennifer Aniston acts very well as the wife of an adulterous man who is kidnapped. Her husband has been cheating on taxes and has salted away over one million dollars in an island bank. Kidnappers know about the money, kidnap Aniston, and say they will not release her unless the million is paid. The kidnappers include a somewhat crazy Nazi sympathizer and two other not too bright men. One of the kidnappers falls for Aniston. The husband is talked into not paying by his paramour. He wants to divorce his wife and she wants to get as large a settlement as possible, but she is unable to prove that he cheated and that he has hidden money.",1429401600,,785,4.574468085106383

6569895,3,B00MEEVVV2,"I found it really hard to get into this film because the storyline was weak and extremely unrealistic. The movie is based around a couple of guys who kidnap a rich man's wife in order to get a million dollars for her release. Not the most unique idea for a film! Anyway, I was expecting it to be witty, judging by the cast, but it was more silly than amusing. Mos Def and John Hawkes come up with the dumbest of plans, which was just not that well thought through. When there plan starts to go downhill, there terrible criminal minds come up with another sketchy plan to get themselves out of the mess they made. The storyline goes from one extreme to another and it doesn't help that they have a Nazi loving criminal to help them, who also has personal issues. Basically, the movie wasn't funny or interesting but I did stick with the film, just to see what these dumb criminals were going to do next. Average!

Round-Up: Judging by the unsuccessful box office takings, I'm not alone with thinking that this film was a total waste of a good cast. Its not often that Jennifer Aniston makes ""Straight To DVD"" movies, but after watching this film, it's not surprising that it flopped. All of the actors try and make the most out of a terrible storyline, but there performances isn't enough to save the film. On the plus side, I did like the ending when characters decide to flip the script and kidnap someone else but it doesn't really go anywhere. I didn't get how someone could go missing for a week without anyone suspecting anything and there was some other sketchy moments that I don't want to mention because I don't want to spoil the film for people who haven't watched it. At the end of the day, it could have been much better if the storyline was thought through properly and if the actual plan made any sense.",1425859200,,1817,4.440119760479042

6569917,3,B00MEEVVV2,"A loose prequel of sorts for the criminal players of Jackie Brown, based on Elmore Leonard's novel The Switch. It's not Jackie, no two ways about it, and it's unfair to compare the two... unfair, but inevitable since they're so spiritually related. The stakes are much lower this time, with a simple kidnapping plot the main point of action and few of the deliciously tangled interwoven storylines of the Tarantino flick. In Leonard's hands that still made for a wildly entertaining read, but on the screen it feels a bit on the shallow side. This translation is missing the charm and finesse of its source material, too, and a little of that spice can really go a long way. John Hawkes manages a really convincing, greasy De Niro impression as the soft-hearted enforcer Louis, while Mos Def's take on mastermind Ordell Robbie (originally played by Samuel L. Jackson) is less indebted to his predecessor. Jennifer Aniston is good as the repressed trophy wife / tennis mom / kidnappee, but the rest of the cast just seems like they're wearing costumes and playing games. They take themselves lightly, so it's tough for me to see the situation as all that serious. It's fine, superficial at worst, but there's little wonder why it slipped under the radar without a whimper when it hit the screens a couple of years ago.",1424044800,,1317,4.780701754385965

Set in 1978 Detroit as well as the Bahamas and featuring a looney tunes Nazi memorabilia freak as well, it's typical Elmore Leonard--sharp, witty dialogue, goofy characters, hot women and crime capers that twist and turn with the wind.

Somewhat goofy plot [no spoilers here], and some pretty good characters.  The bad guys (who were pretty poor and down-on-their-luck) were perfectly scruffy and rough.  The bad-husband was totally unlike-able and incompetent (which fits in this case).  And the locations/vehicles/clothes were excellent for the timeframe.

It was released in an extremely small number of theaters. Most of people, including me, did not see this in a theater. I've enjoyed watching movies a good portion of the year that have familiar names in them but were smaller budgeted films such as this one. Life of Crime is a prequel to Jackie Brown and is not a love story, thriller (per se), or action flick. It is described as a dark comedy, meaning not laugh-out-loud humor but an undertone of humor dealing with serious subject matter. The story is well developed and so are the characters. These are elements that generally make a movie good, and for the last 20 years Hollywood has blatantly removed these elements to streamline movies into long commercials with product placement and obnoxious behavior throughout.

The only downside is that he was going to divorce her and is with his mistress when they call so he's not all that concerned. This puts strain on the kidnappers when plans have to change. This is another movie based off an Elmore Leonard book. If you have seen the other movies from his books (Jackie Brown, 3:10 To Yuma, Get Shorty and most recently Justified) you will know what to expect. The feel of all of them are pretty much alike. This one does have more of a Get Shorty feel to it in the way that it is a very dark comedy and you aren't sure who to root for. The acting is very good and the movie keeps you interested and entertained but I never really got all that into it. I did like all the twists and the events of this but there was just something missing to make me really like it.

6570112,3,B00MEEVVV2,"An enjoyably complicated crime caper flick, made more humorous by the deadpan way in which it is acted and directed.  The mainspring of the plot involves the kidnapping of affluent wife Mickey (Jennifer Aniston) by two would-be criminals Ordel (Yasiin Bey aka Mos Def), and Marshall (Will Forte).  The only snag is that they have not thought the strategy through, and hence their desire to obtain a $1m. ransom from Mickey's crooked husband Frank (Tim Robbins) goes horribly wrong.  Add to the mix an enjoyably cranky Nazi sympathizer Richard (Mark Boone Jr.) and a self-interested girl out for what she can get, especially from Frank (Isla Fisher) and there are plenty of opportunities for comic set-pieces.

In thematic terms, LIFE OF CRIME shows what happens when people are unable to communicate with one another.  Frank is so wrapped up in his masculinist world of golf and extra-marital sex that he cannot understand his wife's frustrations.  Neither Ordell nor Marshall have any real understanding of one another, which condemns their criminal partnership almost from the start.  Richard cannot talk to anyone; his love for Nazi ephemera is simply a means of compensating for his psychological and sexual inadequacies.  In the end he dies in a police shoot-out, his shotgun an apt reminder of how he perpetually looks for ways of avoiding self-analysis.  Director Daniel Schechter is fond of employing the close-up focusing on the characters' blank stares as they struggle - and eventually fail - to make sense of a world that condemns them to a life of perpetual isolation.

In the end Marshall and Mickey find some salvation through an unlikely alliance born out of adversity.  While certainly not falling in love - in this film such elemental emotions are beyond any of the characters' capabilities - they learn how to co-exist with one another.  The denouement seems somehow right, as Frank gets his comeuppance and Ordell is left with nothing.

LIFE OF CRIME is certainly not a laugh-out-loud movie, but its wry humor arising from a series of increasingly improbable situations offers a comment on our ability (or inability) to cope with an arbitrary universe.",1411603200,11,2172,5.067415730337078

Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

Remember the movie Ruthless People? It was really funny, right? Who, in their infinite brilliance, decided to remake this movie and make it a frightening drama?

The preview of this movie is incredibly misleading; it makes it seem like a regular comedic remake. A rich woman is kidnapped, and her husband is thrilled by her absence, rather than eager to pay the ransom money. Again I ask, who decided to make this a drama?

Jennifer Aniston plays the wife, and gives a solid dramatic performance, as she usually does when given the chance. She reminds the audience that she is in real danger, and that her kidnappers could hurt her, or worse.

I didn't happen to like it, because I kept waiting for the jokes to start. If you go into it knowing its a tension-filled, upsetting kidnapping movieand you actually like that type of movieyou might, well, like it a little.
