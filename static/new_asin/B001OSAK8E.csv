8622744,5,B001OSAK8E,"This Film Was great. A huge bonus was seeing Ms. Angel Lola Monroe in a leading role. It had a great plot twist and a surprise ending. This movie has it all beautiful women, great actors, plot twists, suspense, betrayal, action scenes, and did I mention beautiful women? A great movie and worth the money. Get a copy and enjoy.",1340323200,,327,4.466666666666667
8622745,2,B001OSAK8E,"Also sold under the name ""Black Diva."" A rich white NYC doctor has been married to a sexy moody black woman and they haven't had sex for 3 months. They have a Jamaican maid, and they just hired a Nigerian chauffeur. It isn't long before the maid and chauffeur are having sex. Then the maid gets fired and the chauffeur is ""coerced"" to have sex with the doctor's wife. The twist at the end was unexpected as there were no clues leading up to it. In fact the script was contrary to the twist. Acting was fair, script was bad. Low budget. The movie swapped back and forth between 2 songs as its soundtrack, one was Mr. Mister ""Broken Wings.""

F-bomb, nudity, sex.",1310860800,,660,4.365853658536586
