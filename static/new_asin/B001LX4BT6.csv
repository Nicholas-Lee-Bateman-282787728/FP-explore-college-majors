8319960,3,B001LX4BT6,"What a disappointment.  I felt like I had had an outline read to me without much flesh.
The production values were amateurish.  Wretched casting. (couldn't they find someone who at least resembled julius ceasar? We know what he looked like.  Note to staff, JC does not have to sound like a British Army officer from the 1800's.. He was Roman! Plus, what is with having JC eating in all his scenes!  He was physically fit, a good horseman, charismatic and a dynamic leader, NOT a decadent British aristocrat.
Very limited background on the Gallic tribes.  I would have preferred more excerpts from JC's book and less Professors pontificating.
So, amateurish production values, wretched casting, costumes...look homemade.
Ah forget it.  I know I won't buy any more of his stuff.
I'm a history buff and I don't like being played.",1269475200,17,826,4.906474820143885
