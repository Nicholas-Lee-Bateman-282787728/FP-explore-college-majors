2307467,5,B0009OUBDS,"An excellent movie. This is about so much more than a baby being born to an addict. This is a very honest story about codependency and what happens when someone tries to get clean. You find out who your friends truly are. I had to laugh at the mother's comment, ""I'm not an alcoholic, it's just beer and wine"". I have someone in my life who has spoken the same words. Susan Dey does a great job starring in such a strong, touching role.",1463702400,,436,4.2023809523809526

2307473,5,B0009OUBDS,real life story here. most people have some type of addiction and families are usually the ones that get hurt. she found strength to be strong enough to stop smoking. I know this was with the help of God who was not mention of course. but it is always a higher power that can get a person off of drugs. he gave her the inter strength to keep the faith that she would one day get her child back. no devil in hell was going to stop her. her boyfriend or her girlfriend or her mother.,1458259200,2,481,4.020833333333333

2307489,5,B0009OUBDS,"This was a pretty good movie. It gives the viewer a look into the other side of adoption-- the 'not-so-pretty' struggle. We usually only think of the joy of the new parents and the comforts of a new life for the child when we think adoption. We only think of the struggles, the court dates, the years, and the money it may take adoptive parents to finally get their children--- which is a real struggle! However no one seems to really and honestly consider what's going on with the other side. This movie gives that perspective.",1456704000,,528,4.510416666666667

SPOILERS

Do you think that this movie had a happy ending?  I don't think so.

I generally believe that a child belongs with the natural mother.
But this was an unfit mother.
Christina knew that she was pregnant, and she kept drinking and smoking and doing drugs.
Even a regular cigarette is harmful to an unborn baby.
You can all look it up - - how harmful cigarettes are to an unborn baby, not to mention drugs and alcohol.

I felt so bad for that poor little innocent baby.
She was born early and in a lot of pain.
She couldn't have bonded with her mother when she was moved around so much in her first few months.
So, she ends up being raised by an addict mother, a maybe-sometimes-there addict father, an alcoholic grandmother, and addict friends.

I was amazed that Christina never got fired from her job, and that her boss actually stood up for her in Court.

I thought that the ending was so terribly sad.
The baby was not smiling or giggling and she did not look happy at all.
How long until Christina relapses and that little baby suffers some more - - or at the hands of the other addicts in her life?",1453507200,,1178,4.3031674208144794
2307526,5,B0009OUBDS,Susan Day was a good actress and this  movie proves it . I loved this movie and I found it on Amazon instant videos.,1451865600,,116,3.8333333333333335

2307538,4,B0009OUBDS,"At first when I watched this movie I was thinking to myself why on earth would a crack addict have a baby? I just thought that no good could come out of it and the mother should have been ashamed of herself. But the movie was so real and impactful that I found myself indulged in the movie waiting to see what would happen next. Although the movie is an older movie, the movie is still impactful and a good movie to watch. I see the strength and determination of a mother that put her child in danger that tries so hard to save her baby's life and to start over. For any mother that has had a drug addition and beat the odds this movie will keep give you strength and encouragement. I really liked the movie because it was real and told a story of mistakes, love and responsibility.",1449532800,3,782,4.185430463576159

2307546,3,B0009OUBDS,"LIFETIME network's SAD INHERITANCE aired in 1993 as ""Love, Lies & Lullabyes.""

Here, Susan Dey is Christina Kinsey, a cocaine abuser whose out-of-wedlock child is born premature and physically addicted. Gabriel (Moffett), Christina's boyfriend is also an addict. He wants her to surrender the child for adoption.

When Christina's baby is taken from her by social services, she fights to reverse the decision by kicking coke and cleaning up her personal life. Florence Crawford (Toussaint) is the unsympathetic social worker who's had her fill of drug users, and Christina's mom (Laurie) is an alcoholic, so her help is necessarily limited.
