It was too painful.  Usually the students love to watch movies, but when I turned this off, they actually cheered.  I returned it.",1310256000,4,300,4.481481481481482
2203896,1,B000780B5O,"I received this DVD promptly. Unfortunately, the method used to reproduce the film and sound track was of the poorest quality.  This DVD was a birthday present for my husband, who loved the film when he saw it in the movies and on TCM. Watching THIS copy was a painful and disappointing experience for both of us. I will never order a DVD from this seller again.",1306800000,5,362,4.402985074626866
2203897,5,B000780B5O,"It's too bad that this movie has been overlooked and left to languish for so long. As of 2008, it's only been available in this slightly corrupted VHS version. I hope this classic gets rescued soon, is re-mastered onto a DVD, and includes a Director's commentary by Sidney Lumet. Lumet is at his absolute gritty, streets-of-New-York best here and it would be valuable to hear his reflections about the making of the film.

The movie is an adaptation of an Arthur Miller play. I'm not sure why this play never became as famous as Miller's ""Death of a Salesman."" Perhaps it's because this play-become-movie came out at a time when Arthur Miller's career was in eclipse as a result of charges made before the House Un-American Activities Committee during the height of the Cold War scare. Or perhaps ""Death"" is regarded as the quintessential American drama because it deals with our preoccupation over making a sale.

However when I watched this movie again for the first time in many years, I saw that it too in fact has a secondary theme very relevant to today's American life and America's current political concerns. It shows the precarious life of illegal immigrants. In this case, it's the life of Italian immigrants who come to the U.S. hoping to work hard and save money, all the while existing under the threat of being picked up by immigration authorities and deported.

But the problems of illegal immigrants are only a subsidiary, pretext theme here. The real drama centers around an uncle's too-great fondness for the niece he has raised as his ward. This uncle is no Dateline-style sexual predator though. The sexual tension between uncle and niece is at least initially innocent enough. However when one of the two illegals who moves in with the family falls in love with the niece and threatens to take her away into a grown-up world of her own - the uncle turns ruthless. The terrible tension then revolves around how far this man will go in his attempts to prevent his niece's marriage.

The acting here is superb, one of the finest ensemble performances ever captured on film. Carol Lawrence in her first starring role strikes just the right note as the niece who has grown into womanhood. Maureen Stapleton is perfect as the knowing wife. But it's Raf Vallone as the uncle who turns in the central tour de force performance. He's a man tortured by what he can't admit, even to himself. He is buffeted into powerful savagery by his incomprehension, by his denial, of his real motives.
Even if this slightly fading VHS version is a little difficult to watch in spots, it's a must-have.",1200355200,11,2600,4.758314855875832
2203898,5,B000780B5O,"I just watched the film after not seeing it for more than 40 years. The screenplay, the acting, the B&W cinematography are excellent. All of the actors- lead and supporting- are excellent, especially Raf Vallone and Carol Lawrence.

The only negative is not the film, but the quality of the VHS tape. Perhaps I shouldn't complain, since the video is listed as unavailable. I bought the tape, listed as new, from Movies Unlimited through Amazon. It presents the film in total, but there is bad static in certain places and the picture could have been sharper. Nevertheless, it is very worthwhile to buy.",1109462400,15,602,4.844660194174757
