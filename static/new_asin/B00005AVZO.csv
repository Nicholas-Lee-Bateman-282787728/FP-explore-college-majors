I was thrilled when this vhs tape arrived promptly along with a dvd copy as well, pretty amazing. I 'd say. The seller provided a great product in perfect condition. I am looking forward to maybe doing future purchases with this seller.",1458259200,,408,4.527027027027027
7935887,4,B00005AVZO,"As a 62 year old tennis player who has enjoyed playing tennis for over 35 years, I bought this video not knowing much about it except that it was about an up and coming young tennis player and also that it had cameos of tennis greats like Ilie Nastase, Pancho Gonzales, John McEnroe, and
some other hall of famers. There is apparently no other film of Ilie Nastase for us tennis enthusiasts to see, no documentaries even though he was a champion for a few years during the early  1970s. This movie shows you what it's like to train your body to get ready to play in the big tennis tournaments, like Wimbledon. A person who doesn't play tennis regularly may not find this movie as interesting as I do, but it does have a love story at it's heart and deals with relationships between men and women. The movie has good performances by Ali MacGraw and most of the other characters and it  had me close to tears near the end, so I would definitely recommend it to tennis players of advancing years like me.
I consider it to be a solid intelligent movie. Dean Martin's son co-stars in this movie and apparently he was a very good player before losing his life
at a young age.",1444176000,,1169,4.3577981651376145
7935888,5,B00005AVZO,Saw it in 1979 and loved it!  I have been looking for it for 35 years and was so happy to see it again.  I watched it the second I received it.  It was horrible how Dean Paul Martin (Dean Martins son) died in the plane crash at such an early age.  I also remember watching him in a tv show.  We satill miss him.,1404086400,3,311,3.723076923076923
7935889,1,B00005AVZO,"I saw that movie years ago and didn't want to watch it. Amazon returned it to the original owner. I contacted him and let him know that number one, the price he wanted was close to $50.00 and there was no way that I was going to pay that price. So, a one star is more than he deserves.",1393200000,,285,3.847457627118644
7935890,5,B00005AVZO,"A provocative and unique adult love story. Dean-Paul Martin is a blond, blue-eyed young tennis hustler touring Mexico. Ali McGraw is a beautiful mysterious older woman. They seem to be from different worlds, yet find in each other a world of their own. She inspires him to become legitimate at Wimbeldon; he gives her a sense of self worth. Together, their chemistry ignites the screen against the backdrops of Monte Carlo, Cuernavaca, Mexico City, Los Angeles, New York, and Jamaica. A long list of tennis pros , including Pancho Gonzalez as Martin's no-nonsense tennis coach, Guillermo Vilas, John McEnroe, and Ilie Nastase also appear.",1110844800,11,638,5.144230769230769
