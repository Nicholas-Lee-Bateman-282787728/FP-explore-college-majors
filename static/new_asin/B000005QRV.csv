1184714,5,B000005QRV,"As a teenager of the 70's, my family used to attend movies together and we would often go to the latest John Wayne movie.  Well, one double feature later we were watching Prime Cut.  We were captured by the grittiness and good ol' boy syndrome of this film.  The first part caused my family to give up hot dogs for about 10 years!!!!  The action was so fascinating, for that time period, that you found yourself running across that wheat field with Marvin & Sissy.  And Violet's nickels, the part they always cut out of TV showings.  I know they tried to put out a series after the film, with Lawrence Luckinbill (Mr. Lucy Arnez)as the lead character, but it never really caught on.  But we loved it then and we love it now.  Hope you will too.",1016496000,13,744,4.340579710144928
1184715,3,B000005QRV,"A ENJOYABLE FILM DONE WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF ACTION AND COMEDY.  Lee Marvin one of the all time greats plays a chicago hitman who is hired to take down an old nemesis from kansas city, who has been invovled in the  slave trading business. This film even by today's standards can still be  considered a delight to see. the old time dixie music and the farmland  scenery is a throwback to what life was like a long time ago.  Gene Hackman  plays ""mary ann"" the one who tries to compete in the slave  industy. another standout was this was Sissy Spacek's film debut. As for  lee marvin Hollywood lost an icon when he passed away. There will never be  another Lee Marvin as far as i'm concerned.

1184766,4,B000005QRV,"Prime Cut is a rather unusual crime drama set in the mid-west,  specifically the Kansas City metropolitan area.  This includes some wheat fields and rural areas BTW.  It definitely earns it's R rating.  Unless you have a strong stomach and a broad mind you might want to pass on this one.

However those who enjoy a little different crime story would probably like ""Prime Cut"".  Lee Marvin is very good, Gene Hackman is OK but he chews the scenery somewhat.  Sissy Spacek is good and displays her lovely attributes without shame.",1437782400,,529,4.747252747252747

1184817,4,B000005QRV,"I rather liked this weird, shocking and less than half-serious 1972 crime film, even if it is not exactly a masterpiece. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

Irish mob bosses from Chicago have a problem - one of their business partners, known as Mary Ann (Gene Hackman) owes them money - in fact A LOT of money - and not only he obstinately refuses to pay, but treats most unkindly all those who are send to collect. Mary Ann lives on a farm near Kansas City and officially makes his money in cattle slaughtering and meat packaging, but in fact he is a dangeorus and vicious crime lord, ruling his rural neighborhood almost as a feodal duke.

Having received loud and clear (by mail) Mary Ann's latest unequivocal (and, in a way, very tasty) refusal to pay, Chicago mob bosses decide to send in another crew of debt collectors - this time more numerous and especially headed by a particularly vicious enforcer, Nick Devlin (Lee Marvin). Other than 50.000 dollars fee Devlin is also incited to take this offer by the oportunity of revenge - indeed, between him and Mary Ann there is considerable beef (sorry, I couldn't resist)... And then the film really begins.

This film mixes elements of:

- gangster movie, as there is lots of gangsters

- film noir, as there is a femme not only fatale but ""tres fatale""

- western, as there are gunfights and chases in a very rural environment, and also lots of chattel (both four and two legged), shotguns and hats,

- parody, as the two bad guys, both muy macho, are called Mary Ann and Weenie...)))

- soft porn, as for most of the film young Sissy Spacek, for whom it was the first role ever, (and who is cute like a button and absolutely delicious as a damsel in distress) runs completely naked, full frontal included... We also learn a lot about intimate life of little orphan girls who never saw a man...

- promotion of vegetarianism becasue CLASSIFIED TO AVOID SPOILERS - but believe me, you will probably not want a steak or a sausage for some time after watching ""Prime Cut""

- child movie (SPOILER WARNING HERE), as at one moment murderous gangsters with machine guns will mount on the white horse (OK, in fact get in a black car - but metaphorically speaking it is true) to save a virgin princess kept in a tower and later a lot of poor orphans from a bad, bad, bad lady...

As we can see, the coctail is indeed exotic and sometimes surrealistic - in fact it reminds me a little bit of Quentin Tarantino scenarios...

This film contains some deliberately very shocking scenes, including a slave auction - it certainly made a splash in 1972 - all rhytmed by a very good musical score by Lalo Shiffrin. Action scenes however aged a lot and are rather boring and the great finale showdown is very, very disappointing. Dialogs are a mixture of good one liners and smart come backs, but also sadly some banalities. Finally, actions of the bad guys finally don't make much sense and for that reason the frontal shock between Lee Marvin and Gene Hackman doesn't deliver as much as it could be expected.

But still it is an interesting film, with two excellent actors, a cute (and naked) damsel in distress, some shocking moments, some good dialogs, a femme (tres) fatale and, let's say it again, a lot of beef... ENJOY!",1410307200,2,3280,4.567291311754685

1184857,3,B000005QRV,"A happy collision of gangster genre grit with a strain of shameless though shrewd exploitation not unfamiliar to screenwriter Robert Dillon, plus the kinetic, semi-documentary wit of director Michael Ritchie makes Prime Cut both a straightforward noir and a satire of itself.

Nick(Lee Marvin)an aging enforcer for the Chicago mob, sent to Kansas City to deal with a ruthless cattle baron (Gene Hackman) who owes a half-million to Windy City racketeers.

Mary Ann(Gene Hackman), dismissive of old-guard crime chieftains, has set up his own heartland empire guarded by a weird contingent of blond, lookalike young men with rifles.

Not only does he render the bodies of his enemies into sausage meat, Mary Ann is making a fortune in trafficking naked, enslaved young women. One of the latter, played by Sissy Spacek (in her film debut), falls under the protection of Nick, who sets about taking Mary Ann down.

Ritchie's highly energized, absurdist scenes are nicely counterpointed by Marvin's smooth anti-heroics and the self-conscious cheesiness of the sex slave angle.",1397606400,,1070,5.313609467455621
1184858,5,B000005QRV,"I enjoyed the rare screen pairing of Lee Marvin and Gene Hackman. It's a shame that they never worked again because they contrasted each other perfectly. Plus, this was Sissy Spacek's first movie and she showed why she is a talented actress.",1397260800,,241,4.761904761904762
1184859,3,B000005QRV,I went to this movie when I was ten( I know slightly inappropriate) and only recently rediscovered it. Sissy was gorgeous but Gene Hackman and Lee Marvin gave surprisingly uninspired performances and the screenplay was disappointing. The combine chase scene was just stupid.

1184860,5,B000005QRV,This movie is a good example of cinematography for the early '70's. New stars being introduced and older stars on their way out.,1396483200,,128,4.608695652173913
1184861,5,B000005QRV,"What can I say, I am a sucker for 1970's crime-suspense-thrillers...

Pros:

-Realistic look at organized syndicate in this case: Chicago Irish mob
-The opening scene with titles is very original and memorable
-Another memorable scene is the one with Lee Marvin and his henchmen riding in a car,
loading weapons, and getting ready for a confrontation, with a great background music, and
rolling thunder as a precursor for what is about to happen...really-really cool.
-Lots of good open-air atmospheric scenes. Like the one with Lee Marvin and his teenage mistress
hiding in the field of wheat.
-Gene Hackman as a bad guy...really-really cool thing to see...

Cons:

-Not enough character development
-Not enough sex (actually I don't recall any sex in the movie)
-I was not satisfied with the ending of the movie...wish there so more to it.",1395532800,2,841,5.028776978417266
1184862,5,B000005QRV,"I remember seeing this film in the theater.  I enjoyed it then, and I am enjoying it today.  The plot is at times a bit predictable, but there is plenty of action.  There is also a human element to the film.",1378684800,,207,4.0

1184897,4,B000005QRV,"Wow, Lee Marvin, Gene Hackman, a very young (pre ""Carrie"") Sissy Spacek all wrapped up in a sordid, pulpy story directed by Michael Ritchie (The Candidate, original Bad News Bears).  Prime Cut is pure 70's sleaze made all the more enticing with its talent.  This is film noir of the 70's and Ritchie delivers his tough guys in fine form.  Not to be missed.",1358726400,,356,4.53125
1184898,4,B000005QRV,Lee Marvin is apparently some kind of ultimate enforcer for the entire Chicago mob.  Gene Hackman is a huge Kansas farmer and pimp who owes the mob half a million and seems to think his private army of rednecks will allow him to welch and be his own boss.  The oddest part is his army of gorgeous drugged women straight out of orphanages (which must be some kind of symbolism of the dark side of the sexual revolution by 1972 yet seems too literal today.),1355702400,,455,4.341176470588235
1184899,3,B000005QRV,"I had forgotten that I had this film in a pile to ""watch later"" and finally did and was glad I did. This overlooked 1972 film from director Michael Richie while short on run time and story development is still a worthy viewing experience. Mr. Richie went onto a fine career doing such films as The Candidate,The Bad News Bears,Semi-Tough and a few notable comedies like Fletch and Wildcats. He also did Student Bodies which he had his named removed from so nobody's perfect. The film has a great cast it stars veteran tough guy actor Lee Marvin as Nick a mob fixer who is assigned a job to reel in a renegade hood. This hood is a guy named Mary Ann( I kid you not) and he runs a drug and white slavery ring out in rural Kansas City. Played to the cusp of over acting by Gene Hackman Mary Ann uses a meat packing/slaughterhouse plant as a front for his illegal activities. Mary Ann has a dim witted brother called Weenie(at least not Ginger to his brother Mary Ann thankfully) who acts as the muscle played by Gregory Walcott. Nick is a city slicker based out of Chicago who is quiet,mean looking and well dressed. Mary Ann is loud and obnoxious and a country boy .Mary Ann has angered the Chicago mob by stopping his payments and going rogue. He's also grounded up previous gangsters from Chi-Town who were sent to persuade him into sausages and sent them back to Chicago in bundles of meat. So Nick ,a trusted sidekick driver and 3 ""green"" young wannabees head from Chicago to Kansas City to see what can be done to correct the situation. What you get besides a lot of violence is the classic city versus country scenario. Slick Nick and company pop into Mary Ann's barn where various young girls are being drugged and penned like pigs or cows would be. One of the girls is played by Sissy Spacek(you might have heard of her) and another is played by 70's B movie starlet Janit Baldwin( Gator Bait,Ruby) .Nick is not amused by MA's little gambit and informs him that he's taking one of the girls as down payment for what he owes. He chooses Poppy (Spacek) a pretty little blond who along with Violet was raised in a Missouri orphanage .Said orphanage also was a front for breeding future girls to be sold as sex slaves. MA says that he'll make good on the money he owes but of course you KNOW he's not going to. Violence erupts Nick and Poppy are on the lamb and the rest of Nick's associate's are either killed or on the run as well. Nick and Poppy have a memorable scene in a wheat field where a hired hand tries to grind the two up with a giant wheat harvester .This scene is the most memorable thing in Prime Cut. You feel the fear of 2 people lost in a wheat field and a giant combine machine trying to rip them to shreds. The film has  great cinematography and the colors are top notch. Something about 70's cinema and the whole style of shooting makes it stand out. As a last twist in the story Mary Ann is married to Clarabelle (Angel Tompkins) who once was involved with Nick. Will she aid Nick in bringing down her husband or stay loyal to him? This film could've used more story building and feels rushed at times. It's also the film debut of the young Sissy Spacek who's good here. She play's naive and resourceful very good here. Poppy her character reminds me of the character played by Jennifer Jason Leigh in Miami Blues. Both have that ""are you kidding me"" sense of naiveness  that makes them endearing. Baldwin also made her debut here and is less memorable but fine for what's asked of Violet. To sum it up if you want a fine nights viewing I recommend Prime Cut. The cast is stellar ,the look awesome and the action intense.",1324771200,2,3645,4.374631268436578
1184900,3,B000005QRV,"I saw this film in it's original theatrical release back in 1972. I was 15 then and it was quite a shocking movie at the time. I was glad to see that it had finally been released on DVD and so I purchased this version. I was dismayed to watch it and see that it had been edited from the original, with some material ""cut"" out. I particularly remember the original had one scene of Sissy Spacek with full frontal nudity when she was drugged- up and in the cow pen display scene. You won't see it here.

There's plenty of violence, a slaughterhouse where girls are sold like cattle, and Gene Hackman plays a character named Mary Ann.  Now if Rolling Thunder could just get a decent DVD release.",1306627200,,500,4.767441860465116
1184903,5,B000005QRV,"Given that this movie is - in 2011 - four decades old, it is stilling a living testament to (1) the exploitation of women, (2) the exploitation of power, (3) the challenge of aging and (4) criminal enterprise as a part of American life.  Yes, the character development is now considered ""cookie cutter""; but the challenges of human liberation faced in this movie are still present.

I didn't remember much of it except the character Weinie's attempted stabbing of Nick (Lee Marvin) with...well, you gotta see it. Seeing it again makes me appreciate what a wacky, goofball take this is on film noir (only in bright sunlight). All along the way there are quirky touches that make this film more memorable than it should have been for me the first time I saw it. Just one thing as a for instance: the hitmen drive from Chicago to Kansas City and we see them just sitting in the back of the car for pretty much the whole drive while the music (by Lalo Schrifrin) is pulsing and insistant. The juxtaposition struck me funny after I thought about it. This is a 70's film definitely worth seeing. Also, as an aside, Sissy Spacek looks great naked. Enjoy!",1263945600,2,824,4.427631578947368
1184906,4,B000005QRV,"This thing is whack! Very edgy and ahead of its day of 1972. Lots of hand held camera work, weird angles and off-beat cutting. The opener of a man ground up in a hamburger machine gives you a clue to what's ahead. The acting really isn't much by today's standards. Lee Marvin maintains a macho poker face throughout. Hackman is a lot younger, but still seems like he's over 50. Sissy Spacek got a lot of notice for this film back in the day, but all she does is look wide-eyed most of the time. The violence is not as perfect as today's films, but this is beautifully photographed. How many mafia tales are set in Kansas City? None. See this.

OK, maybe just male people. Add a proto-feminist-vegan comparison of the exploitation of animals to the exploitation of women and a great performance by one of the cast members from Plan 9 From Outer Space and you have the most unjustly neglected film of the 70's.

You can see it for the first time in ""The Killers"" where he intentionally got totally drunk before his dying hitman character kills Ron Reagan.

1184933,5,B000005QRV,"Being from Kansas City I'm always interested in any cinema shot here, especially since there are so very few movies made in this part of the country.

When I learned about the existence of this movie with Gene Hackman and Lee Marvin I had to see it.  I added the DVD to my collection and what can say?  This movie and it's implications are almost beyond my comprehension; if this is truly how Hollywood sees the midwest, I am thrilled!

Man-butchering ganster farmers, drug controlled sex slaves on the auction block, nordic looking homo-erotic henchmen, groin-punching good times between manical brothers, and Hackman's ""Mary Ann"" character riding high on a wave of murderous lunacy declaring his love of eating guts!

The mind boggles under the weight of this grindhouse style masterpiece that makes ""Blue Velvet"" look like ""The Santa Clause""!

In spite of all of this glorious surrealism, the only improvement I could possibly suggest would be that it should have been a musical.  I will swear to my dying day that if this movie would have had some lavish musical numbers no one would have ever even thought twice about ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"".  If Lee Marvin could have done that dreadful ""Paint Your Wagon"" movie, he could have been up to the task of turning this macabre little film into a up-roar that college kids would still be quoting every day.

This film should be required viewing for anyone even thinking about coming to this part of the country.

I'm going to go do my part to live up to this film's dipiction of KC by putting on my mother's wedding dress and making sausage out of whatever isn't fast enough to escape my grasp!

Unreal situations from start to finish.  However, if you are looking for 70's style B movie with gangster type action, give Prime Cut a try.  I enjoyed it and it is one of my guilty pleasures, for action type shows.  The DVD itself wasn't the greatest quality, but it had been 30 years since I had seen it in the theater, so the quality may not have been that good to begin with.

1184935,2,B000005QRV,"I saw this movie quite a few years ago (probably about 15 or 20 years ago). I must say the first time I saw it I wasn't really impressed. Then I read a review of it and the review stated how great it was and that Marvin was excellent and that it was just a great movie. So when it was released on DVD I went out and purchased it. I remember little about it from the first time other than it had Sissy Spacek in it in one of her first roles, if not her very first big screen role. I must say that I didn't find this movie any better now than I did then. I appreciate Marvins career and his acting as well as Gene Hackman. These two guys are two of the finest actors of my time but this movie is just not that good. The story could have been much better and the core of it is good. Marvin is a respected Chicago underworld enforcer who is sent on a mission by Eddie Egan (the real Popeye Doyle from the French Connection drug bust in New York) to collect $500,000 that an associate name Mary Ann has forgotten to pay. Mary Ann (Gene Hackman... and don't ask me why he is Mary Ann cause they never explain it) is in the mid west and has a meat packing place and slaughter house. He has sent back several other bag men to the Chicago mob processed as hot dogs and hamburger after he has killed them. Mary Ann also is now with Marvins old flame Clarabell (Jeez what is with these stupid names?). Mary Ann also deals in white slavery, enter Sissy Spacek. He sells and displays these girls nude in the same livestock pens full of hay that he does his pigs and cows.

This is an interesting novelty kind of movie. If you are a fan of Marvin or Hackman check it out. Even if you are a fan of Sissy Spacek. But alas this movie is just not that good. The old school mob vs the new middle America mob that has reached even the heartland could be interesting and is a little bit but this is just a pretty bad movie.",1140739200,6,1902,4.018469656992084
1184936,2,B000005QRV,"I often ask myself how two really excellent actors in their prime would get committed to a project like ""Prime Cut"".  You would be hard pressed to find a dumber story, plot line or set of characters.  This is almost a purposeful testament to all that was worse with the 70's ""Lew Wasserman"" type production deals.",1128729600,6,313,4.571428571428571
1184957,4,B000005QRV,"Nick Devlin (Lee Marvin), an enforcer for the Chicago Mob, is sent to Kansas City to collect a debt from a rancher and meat packer named Mary Ann (Gene Hackman). Mary Ann was sent by the mob to run things down there and now claims the fiefdom as his own. Previous enforcers were dealt with in a way appropriate to Mary Ann's chosen industry. Nick takes his trusted driver and three mob goons with him to collect the money. Upon their arrival, they find Mary Ann presiding over a livestock auction, but the livestock in this auction is the meat packer's second source of income, prostitution. Nick rescues Poppy (Sissy Spacek), a drugged out young woman, and they leave. Neither Nick or Mary Ann will give in to the other, leaving only one conclusion.

""Prime Cut"" directed by Michael Ritchie, and made in 1972, is a new film for me. Recently, Ebert and Roeper featured a number of Lee Marvin films new to DVD. I have never been a fan of Marvin, but the films looked intriguing so I gave a few a try and also revisited ""The Professionals"", one of my favorite films starring Burt Lancaster and Lee Marvin.

It is important to remember that the film was made in 1972 because it strikes the viewer as dated. Shortly after Nick rescues Poppy, he buys her a dress (she was naked at the livestock auction) and they go to dinner at the fancy restaurant in his hotel. Poppy's new dress does little to hide her breasts, but she seems blissfully unaware as the older men and women in the restaurant stare at her. All the time, Nick and Poppy ignore them, trying to have a conversation. Everything about this scene screams early 70s to me, from their conversation to the `subtle' look at class. Later in the film, Nick and his goons arrange to meet Mary Ann at the local county fair and collect the money. This sequence is introduced with a series of close ups of a man walking on stilts, children laughing, etc., all meant to disorient the viewer before letting them become familiar with the new setting. Again, very 70s.

There are many sequences in the film which are strange, unusual and interesting, ultimately making the film worth watching. From the opening sequence; Mary Ann's demented brother, Weenie (Gregory Walcott) gets rid of one of the mob's enforcers (perhaps the most memorable scene), to a harvesting machine chasing Nick and Poppy through a corn field, Ritchie seems to be paying homage to Hitchcock and it works. The action scenes are interesting and hold your attention. Even the scene set in the corn field, which is close enough to be called a rip off of the famous chase from Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest""; Ritchie adds a little touch at the end to make it memorable and interesting. You won't be able to stop watching it.

When the story turns to more sedate matters and everything relies on the actors, the film is less successful. Marvin seems to have been most comfortable portraying mobsters, generals and cowboys throughout his career. His demeanor is well-suited for these types of roles. He merely has to stare at most men and they will surrender. This persona works well with this character. But when Nick is supposed to be human, it doesn't work. When Nick takes Poppy to dinner, it isn't clear if Nick is trying to romance Poppy or become her supportive ""Uncle"". She clearly seems to be flirting with him but Nick doesn't seem to return the favor. Thankfully. At this point Marvin was 47 (Wow, he looks older. But I guess he always did.) and Spacek was 22. Not very age appropriate. This scene works if Poppy is flirting with Nick; he has just saved her from a life of prostitution and her life has been pretty screwed up to that point. But it would be creepy to watch Marvin's Nick putting the moves on the younger actress.

Gene Hackman is always interesting to watch. A villain with the name Mary Ann is going to have to be fairly menacing. Hackman follows occasional outbursts with a quick smile or joke, trying to hide his true menace. This performance reminded me exactly of Lex Luthor and makes this character seem all the more like a dry run for the villain he would play in the ""Superman"" films beginning in 1978.

Sissy Spacek is good, in her first starring role, but the part is a very traditional take on the female sidekick so prevalent in action films. For a great performance, check out her later work in ""In The Bedroom"".

""Prime Cut"" is a memorable exercise in action filmmaking. Two sequences from the film will stay with me for a long time. Can you figure out which ones?",1125273600,14,4517,4.589838909541512

1184959,1,B000005QRV,"What rubbish.  Ridiculous situations, and poor writing doom this boring, stupid film.  Probably, the worst film that starred either Lee Marvin or Gene Hackman.  A real hack job that was meant to snare unsuspecting theater goers who liked the stars.",1123200000,6,248,5.15
1184960,4,B000005QRV,"I was looking for the new release of ""Point Blank"" at my local retail DVD buffet and they didn't have it so, finding ""Prime Cut"" instead (which I'd never seen) I bought it kind of as a consolation prize; but I was disappointed because I'd been looking for something with the kooky, flashy, noir-weirdness ""Point Blank"" offered.

Grudgingly, I popped this in and, within the first few minutes of the movie, I realized that ""Prime Cut"" is definitely weirder than ""Point Blank.""  Somehow, I'd forgotten this was a Michael Ritchie film, made just after ""Downhill Racer"" and just before he really swung in with ""The Candidate,"" ""Smile,"" ""The Bad News Bears"" and ""Semi-Tough.""

We begin with a graphic tour of a slaughterhouse, through which a diced Chicago hood is processed into hot dogs by a guy named Weenie who wouldn't look out of place in the back of a panel of ""Sin City.""

Then there are the barnyard pens of wasted, naked sex slaves drooled over by Kansas City moneymen.

Presiding over it all is a hairy Gene Hackman, chuckling and shoveling hog guts from a plate into his usual sideways grin.

Lee Marvin, looking cut from salmon-toned marble, marches through the whole thing like he's the only character who's already read the script and knows every single decision he needs to make.

This is a movie that asks us to root against the upstart country boy who defies the mob, to favor the tough-as-railroad-ties mafia enforcer. He wades into the sticks to smack the machine so it'll work right again.  And we do.

Sure, the movie has it's problems.  There are *lots* of obvious visual metaphors for the way big systems process little things into profitable distortions (none of which trump the slaughterhouse credit sequence).  And the women are mostly helpless, have a tendency to get assaulted but bounce right back at the sight of a shopping bag full of clothes.  The final shoot-out drags a bit during the sunflower field scene.  And, as for the film's signature chase scene -- Marvin and Sissy Spacek flee a gigantic thresher as it chases them across an open wheat field -- I couldn't ignore two thoughts: 1) Why don't they just double-back and run around behind the thing, which cannot easily turn and 2) They could run faster if they weren't holding hands.

Still, this is a weird, wild, underseen gem, a colorful thriller, almost like an inverted Travis McGee adventure, or like a particularly demented Don Siegel picture.  You (or at least *I*) have to love a crime thriller that takes a five minute time-out while the two main badguys play grabass in a kitchen, wrestling around like teenaged brothers.  This was a movie that made me perfectly happy to temporarily miss ""Point Blank.""",1121817600,,2699,4.7844827586206895
1184961,4,B000005QRV,"Though short of classic status, ""Prime Cut"" has alot to recommend it.  Director Michael Ritchie has a sharp eye for Middle-America ambience and stages some good action set pieces.  Lee Marvin is in classic tough guy form as Devlin, the bagman sent by the Chicago bosses to collect a debt from sleazy Mary Ann(Gene Hackman), whose Kansas City meat plant is a front for a more lucrative trade in white slavery and narcotics.  Hackman, in what is in essence an extended cameo, makes a colorful impression here.  Sissy Spacek, as a girl entrapped in Hackman's operation, isn't really given much to do in her film debut but is easy on the eyes in a fresh-faced kind of way.  The film breezes by at an economical 86 minutes.  Interesting casting here with Gregory Walcott(""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" infamy) as Hackman's brother and Eddie Egan(the real-life inspiration for Popeye Doyle of ""The French Connection"" fame) as a Chicago mob boss.",1118880000,5,934,4.8427672955974845
1184962,2,B000005QRV,"This is kinda mainstream for a review based on sleaze points, but hey, even Frenzy gets a point for the strangling scene.  Anyway, in spite of the big time actors you can forget the plot which involves white slavery and some other stuff, who cares.

We got two scenes here worth a snip.  The first is a county fair style hog contest, only with mobsters replacing the 4-H'rs and drugged out nubile starlets replacing the pork.  Oh, did I mention they're nekkid?  Straw pens and everything.  I'm not going to speculate what the straw is for.

The main draw is an extended scene with Sissy Spacek showing her Janet Jackson's, mainly beneath a see-through dress that Lee (unaccountably) takes her out to dinner in.  OK, Ms. Spacek has showed them before, or rather after, but they never looked better than this, a real pervy lolly type feel.

""Prime Cut"" is essentially the ancient fairy tale about the ogres preying on innocent maidens until the knight comes to town updated to a rural Kansas mob-war milieu. The chief ogre here is Mary Ann (not ""Mother"") a Great Plains gang leader played by Gene Hackman with the relish of a man who knows he may never see a role quite like this one again. His shaven-headed brother Weenie (Gregory Walcott) does things like run rival mobsters through meat-grinders and attack limos with pitchforks. The representative maiden is played by Sissy Spacek, back when she looked cute rather than merely odd. Lee Marvin plays the knight, flourishing a submachine gun while wearing a pricey 70s-style silver-gray suit.

None of which goes anywhere near far enough in relaying the serious strangeness of the thing. For that you need scenes like the one introducing Mary Ann tucking into a plate of beef guts (""I like 'em!""). Or the young gangster eagerly introducing boss Marvin to his mother. Or the shootout in a field of enormous sunflowers. Or Lee's visit to ex-mistress Clarabelle (I swear I'm not making up these names) who lives on a houseboat that looks as if it was designed by Christo collaborating with Heidi Fleiss. And I could go on.

Ritchie later made a number of innocuous comedies and Robert Redford vehicles of the ""Downhill Racer"" variety. But just once (the very late ""Alleged Cheerleader-Murdering Texas Mom"" being a partial exception), he got out of the cage and ran wild, and ""Prime Cut"" is the result. Compare it to Tarantino if you must, but if he or any of the other bravos has ever matched this, I haven't heard about it. ""Prime Cut"" is sui generis. They don't make 'em like this any more for the very simple reason that they never did in the first place. That's our loss.

The film is so over the top that I have to believe director Ritchie was going for an ultra-violent black comedy  (does ""Pulp Fiction"" seem so original now?) Marvin plays the role of the city boy in the country with his patented stoic cool. Not a lot of plot development involved, but the film is notable for some interesting set-pieces like a memorable thresher machine chase and the opening slaughterhouse sequence, which is sure to put you off eating sausage for quite a while. ""Prime Cut"" also introduced audiences to Sissy Spacek, who gives much more depth to her character than you would expect. The film is quite an anamoly for its director, who went on to give us more low-key satires like ""Smile"", ""Downhill Racer"" and ""The Candidate"".
