8129554,4,B000G8NVSO,"90-minute DVD (includes music and tab) - From Italy, Beppe Gambetta originally trained as a classical musician, but he converted to flatpick guitar after hearing bluegrass. While also very accomplished as a fingerpicking guitarist, this DVD presents six eclectic tunes for flatpickers ranging from Hungarian and Italian pieces (Czardas, Iride) to reworked renditions (in DADGAD tuning) of American fiddle tunes like Old Joe Clark, Soldier's Joy and Salt Creek (that Beppe calls ""Slow Creek). The founding member of the Italian band ""Red Wine"" has a very relaxed communication style that succinctly focuses on the relevant, important information needed to learn the tunes taught.

Beppe's playing on his Taylor guitar can be quite inspiring because of his innovation and creativity. In fact, he says that the most important lesson is ""to be personal ... be unique."" For that reason, his romantic ""Slow Creek"" calls for two strings to be re-tuned before he demonstrates a cross-picking technique. ""Iride,"" a mazurka (in  time) by Italian composer Pasquale Taraffo, dates back to the turn of the 20th century and will challenge even advanced players with its use of triplets. Beppe cautions us to ""start slower and with preliminary exercises."" Another European piece, ""Czardas,"" requires the guitarist to speed up each time through the song ""until the dancers are falling to the floor.""

Besides his witty advice of drinking 6 or 7 espressos, Beppe does emphasize that the secrets for playing fast are to start slow, practice exercises with hammer-ons and pull-offs, and mentally concentrate on giving power to the left hand. A few of the songs are accompanied by rhythm guitarist Artie Traum, and the chords for those tunes are also provided in the music/tab booklet. Two of the pieces taught (Iride, Mediterranean Dance) can be heard on Gambetta's ""Good News From Home"" album (GLCD-2117). He closes the DVD with his performance of the title cut from that album.

Gambetta is an artist who has achieved excellence in his field. We thank him for sharing some of his song arrangements, and we'll work on the homework assignment he gives us to ""be a teacher of yourself as it's an important part of learning."" Thanks to his inspiration, the next time we meet I hope to be ready to show him my very own DADGAD arrangement for ""Sally Goodin.""
