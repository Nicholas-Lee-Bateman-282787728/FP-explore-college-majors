5374473,4,B00A0HT94G,"Three years ago, director John Hyams'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Soldier-Regeneration/dp/B002U6CJCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Soldier: Regeneration</a>&nbsp;breathed new life into a thought-dead franchise and thereby made one of the best action pictures of the year. To say that I was interested in seeing this follow-up is an understatement: with a good deal of the previous one's cast and crew returning, along with the new additions of martial arts' ""it"" guy Scott Adkins and cult fight choreographer Larnell Stovall, this one looked like a surefire topper to its immediate prequel and another great action outing. Did the movie live up to my high expectations? ...well, at least partially. This is, without question, a great action outing with some of the better fight scenes put out this year. However, the same way that ""Regeneration"" was a huge departure from the style of its bouncier predecessors, so too is ""Day of Reckoning"" a departure from the standard action genre as we know it, with a storyline so far removed from what I was expecting that it took a bit of time for me to contemplate whether it counted for or against the movie. Overall, this one's definitely worth checking out and even buying, but depending on your expectations, it counts as the end of the ""Universal Soldier"" franchise.

The story: a husband and father (Adkins,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-III-Redemption/dp/B003FXXNH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed III: Redemption</a>) is beaten half to death and sees his family murdered before him by Luc Devereaux, the maverick Unisol (Jean-Claude Van Damme). Recovering from his injuries and plagued by inexplicable hallucinations, he sets out to untangle the mystery behind the killing and exact vengeance on Devereaux.

For those of you who watched the last film, you'll glean from summary that things do not neatly pick up from where the story left off. Looking at the cast list and film poster, you'll no doubt also wonder what the heck Dolph Lundgren and Andrei Arlovski are doing in this picture, since they'd recently been killed off. And as a matter of fact, why is Luc now killing people? Questions like these, along with several others presented by the film's narrative, have flustered enough viewers for them to declare this a ""semi sequel"" that's not necessarily part of the same story arc. Me, I think it is a proper sequel, and that we're to assume that a good deal of time has passed since the previous flick and this one. Luc Devereaux has become an enigmatic figure to both allies and enemies with a rather grandiose master plan. The character played by Andrei Arlovski is not the same as his last one; I don't think there's meant to be any connection between them, and Arlovski's sporting a beard to make sure he doesn't look too much like the other character. And as for Dolph Lundgren...well, he was cloned once before, wasn't he? His name is never spoken in the film, so I'm won't to think that he isn't even supposed to be Andrew Scott anymore, regardless of what the credits tell us. I've been able to placate myself with these answers, but people who don't want this kind of ambiguity are probably going to be disappointed.

Personally, what jarred me more than any part of the plot was the style of the movie. With its numerous storyline twists, hallucination scenes, and insane amounts of bloodletting, this is very nearly a horror film. At the very least, this one gives equal balance to the action/thriller label. Having the characters rediscover parts of their personal history has always been a component of the series, but in ""Day of Reckoning,"" it's an uninhibitedly dark process, complete with psycho-thriller imagery. I'm still not entirely sure how to feel about it, since this - more than any of the character-related aspects - makes the film feel wholly different from its predecessors. With that said, it does inspire some decent intensity out of the performers... Despite his third-name billing, Scott is clearly the lead in this movie and carries things well, giving a strong performance and again demonstrating why he is the new top action hero in all respects even if Hollywood hasn't caught on yet. Van Damme has surprisingly few scenes in the movie, but those he does partake in are good: he doesn't even need to speak anymore to get his points across, as demonstrated in any scene he shares with his Unisol subordinates (he has those, by the way). Dolph Lundgren has even less screentime than Van Damme (seriously, what are these two doing with top billing?), but does okay with another nice and crazy monologue. Andrei Arlovski, though he, like Adkins, has more screentime than Van Damme and Lundgren combined, doesn't have much to act, and love interest Mariah Bonner (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freerunner/dp/B00595W3OW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freerunner</a>) isn't very memorable.

Production-wise, the movie is strong. It looks very crisp, and definitely worthy of the theatrical release it's supposedly going to get, but speaking preemptively, I don't know where the reported 3D is supposed to come in. Action-wise, the film is a powerhouse of extremely brutal hand-to-hand action. Is it as good as I had been expecting? ...it might be better to point that it wasn't *what* I was expecting. After their first collaboration in the aforementioned ""Undisputed 3"" set the bar for all future martial arts flicks, I had been expecting that Adkins and Larnell Stovall would present us with more lightning-speed martial arts wizardry, but what they delivered instead are brawls. Violent, gritty, gory brawls. I think this had to do with the physical constraints of many of the performers, and in a way, it's disappointing...but then again, the fights tend to be better than good and easy to appreciate for both the physicality of the performers and the gamely shooting and editing style of the filmmakers. We've got seven fights here, and while the fights Andrei Arlovski has with a nameless Unisol and Dolph Lundgren are pretty lackluster, the rest of the clashes are lengthy, technically sound, and appear like either fight could win - all the things I want in a fight. My personal favorite is the second showdown between Adkins and Arlovski, wherein they beat the hell out of each other with baseball bats. While not the barn-burner I had been hoping it to be, Adkins vs. Van Damme during the finale is definitely the best fight the two have had - beating the snot out of their outings in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shepherd-Border-Patrol/dp/B0011VIO46/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shepherd: Border Patrol</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Assassination-Games/dp/B00596WEVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Assassination Games</a>.

If I were to nitpick, I'd point out that the Unisols seem a bit frailer than usual, this time around, but neither this nor any of the other criticisms I've written about the film could keep it from the relatively high rating it's getting. Whether or not you appreciate it, I think, depends on both how much you enjoyed the last film and how far you think the action genre can be bent until the filmmakers have to make a choice whether they want to make an action film or a horror flick. The strength of this one's action scenes determined that it could be bent pretty far this time, but overall, I could have done without the change in direction. While there's nothing in the film that I don't explicitly dislike, the things I'm uncertain about keep this one from a perfect score. While its rating is the same I gave to ""Regeneration,"" the four stars for ""Day of Reckoning"" are of a slightly less enthusiastic variety.",1351296000,32,7906,5.352090032154341

5374506,3,B00A0HT94G,"I have always been a Van Damme fan, and really enjoyed Universal Soldier. When Universal Soldier 2: The Return came out a few years later, I was very disappointed. Then Universal Soldier 3: Regeneration was released years later, I was immediately impressed with this rebirth of the franchise, and I was really looking forward to the next entry as the ending showed there would be another sequel. Finally, Universal Soldier 4: Day of Reckoning was released, and I still don't know if I like it or hate it!
  Day of Reckoning is not a bad movie at all, it just didn't feel like a Universal Soldier movie. First off, the lead protagonist (or antagonist, by the end of the movie once you learn the truth he may have been the bad guy all along) is John, played by Scott Adkins, a government UNISOL (Universal Soldier) who is hunting the rogue UNISOL Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) for the death of his wife and daughter. It becomes a murder/mystery, with flashbacks of the murder itself as John witnessed the killing of his family. He also has hallucinations of Luc and his dead daughter, tormenting him, while asleep or awake, kinda like Freddy Kruger.
  Luc is now a leader of a UNISOL cult, where his second in command is Andrew Scott (played by Dolph Lundgren, assumingly a 2nd clone, since the Scott in 'Regeneration' was killed). It seems the government has once again restarted the UNISOL program, but Luc has found a way to free them from government control, using a serum injected into their necks.
  Andrei ""The Pitbull"" Arlovski also returns as Magnus, codename ""The Plumber"" (Magnus is most likely a clone of the NGU from 'Regeneration'). At first he is sent by the government to hunt down the rogue UNISOLs, but eventually is defeated by Scott and freed, joining Luc Devareux's group.
  John eventually meets Magnus, who tries to free him with the serum. But somehow, John rejects the serum. This brings about a few nice and bloody fights between John and Magnus throughout the film, Adkins and Arlovski at their finest!
  Also in the film (more like a cameo) is former boxing champion Roy Jones Jr., playing a UNISOL in Devareux's camp.
  This is a very violent, bloody movie! I own the US blu-ray version of the film, as the uncut NC-17 version is only available in Germany, England, and Canada. But thankfully Amazon has the uncut version on instant video! It is the better version, a bit more gory and a bit more nudity than the US R-rated version. Definitely not for kids!
  Like I said this is not a bad movie, but it doesn't feel like a Universal Soldier movie. Scott Adkins does a great job, but the fact that Van Damme and Lundgren are barely in the film (Van Damme and Lundgren don't even share a scene together) feeds into this movie feeling like something else entirely. I do hope that they continue the frachise though, make the next one more like 'Regeneration' and maybe bring back Michael Jae White from 'The Return.' (They could clone him, and would be nice to see White and Scott Adkins fight again, a rematch from the film 'Undisputed 2'). I would not recommend this film for someone looking for mindless action and things blowing up like the previous 3 films. But if you are into gory, graphic violence, a little bit of murder/mystery, and with a sprinkle of horror thrown in, this is your movie!",1418428800,3,3330,4.660409556313994

The opening POV scene is stunning, and is as gripping an intro as any movie I've ever known. I used to praise ""Narc"" for having the most powerful and visceral start to an action film, (I'm know there's dozens of others too,) but man, this Universal Soldier 4 or 5? really kicks things off in a spectacular manner. And outside of that scene, there's quite a few other top-notch action sequences with one ridiculously great long tracking shot where the hero dispatches dozens of enemies through some catacombs. The hero pulls off some legitimately sweet moves too for a kung-fu actioner. Also, Van Damme and Lundgren are barely in it, and used to maximum effect.

2.  The main character (John) tries to figure out what is going on, and ultimately learns he's a clone created to kill Luc.
3.  He kills both Luc (and Dolf Lundgren's irrelevant character).

5374543,2,B00A0HT94G,"Review originally posted on my website, From the Mind of Tatlock

What has happened to the Universal Soldier series? We got a cheesy, but awesome movie in the early 90's, Universal Soldier and from there, we were treated to a bunch of low budget, STV sequels (Universal Soldier II: Brothers in Arms and Universal Soldier III: Unfinished Business). In the late 90's, we got a true sequel by the way of Universal Soldier: The Return, which ignored the STV versions, but quite honestly sucked. Finally, we got a worthy sequel in Universal Soldier: Regeneration, which rocked me so much, it hurt. So, I ask again what the hell happened to the Universal Soldier series, to warrant us yet another s***ty sequel by the way of Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning? We were so close to having two good movies in a row...

Short nitty-gritty plot description from IMDb is as follows: John looks to take down Luc Deveraux after a home invasion claims his wife and daughter. The fight pits John against Andrew Scott and an army of genetically enhanced warriors; meanwhile, he must contend with a UniSol in relentless pursuit.

I don't even know where to begin with this one. The movies plot defines the word convoluted. It throws at us a bunch of nonsensical exposition about clones, implanted memories and extreme bouts of fighting. We also got Van Damme looking very depressed and like he wasn't being paid to be in the movie.

The movie follows newcomer to the series Scott Adkins as John, whose family is brutally murdered in front of him by Jean-Claude Van Damme himself, Luc Deveraux. Flash forward nine months of being in a coma and John gets out and hunts down Luc. Cut to several flashy scenes of a depressed Van Damme, a criminally underused Dolph Lundgren, returning as Andrew Scott and finally Andrei 'The Pit Bull' Arlovski, who returns from the far better sequel Regeneration.

The movie is just too damn long and too damn strange for my taste. It plods along with no end in sight and the action scenes come few and far between. I will admit, when they do happen, they are pretty damn exciting, although I wish the fight between Adkins and Van Damme would've lasted longer. Same goes with the Dolph Lundgren fight. Also, the movie is pretty violent and gory, which surprised me a lot and I really enjoyed it better for it.

Fans of the first movie and Universal Soldier: Regeneration are probably going to be pretty disappointed with Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning. I know some reviews really praise the movie for trying something different and unique, but honestly, I just see as them trying to be too damn smart and odd for their own good. If you happen to be curious enough to see how the series has once again dropped in quality, check the movie out. You'll probably enjoy the fight scenes and gore, but other than that, you'll be bored to tears, much like Van Damme was.

Rating: 2/5 (-1 for an underused, but bored Van Damme and Lundgren. -1 for being too damn long. -1 for a plot that lacks. +1 for the gore and +1 for the fight scenes.)",1374883200,,3050,4.637037037037037

I thought I would see more of our action stars and when I didn't, I lost interest and then turned it off.

5374550,1,B00A0HT94G,"Universal Solider 1 set up that the army found a way to reanimate a corpse and control it. So they thought. Things go a bit iffy when two of them begin to regain their memories and recall they have unfinished business with each other. The second was a mega flop, where Luc Devenroe or whoever it is Van Damme plays is pretty much back to normal and helping to stop the worlds worst wrestler ever from taking over the Universal Soldier army. Part 3 was a blur. I just remember thinking it had nothing to do with the original film, it just brought two characters back.

Now a 4th installment. Now Luc is the bad guy? Dolph Lungren is back, after being killed how many times now? And they work together? Lungren takes orders from Van Damm? WTF??? A new guy with Van Dam moves is the new good guy? Who wrote this? And have they even seen the original movies?

Had this movie NOT been in the Universal Soldier name, it probably would have been passed off as maybe 2 and a half stars... but to take the original hero, and turn him into the villain? It's just dumb. It's like making a sequel to a popular hero movie and for no reason at all, suddenly Martin Riggs is a terrorist, Axel Foley is a drug lord, Rocky has become a Russian fighter, Cameron Poe has become a mafia boss... it just makes no sense.",1372809600,,1298,4.272357723577236
5374551,4,B00A0HT94G,"While I did enjoy the original ""Universal Soldier"" (1992), I wasn't exactly gaga over it.  In my opinion, it was okay.  I liked it scarcely more than your average low-budget action/kick flick.  I felt the same way about ""Universal Soldier: The Return"" (1999).  It was decent enough.  So by the time ""Universal Soldier: Regeneration"" came out in 2009, I'd basically resigned myself to ignoring it.  That is until I heard nothing but great things about it for so long that I finally broke down.  Everything I heard was correct.  I dug the hell out of it.  Better than the 1st.  A lot better!  The only real complaint I had about it was the blatant use of stunt-doubles during the film's lengthy (and otherwise awesome) climax.  Even with their obvious presence, the action scenes were still very enjoyable.  So when I heard that ""Regeneration""'s director, John Hyams, was re-teaming with Jean Claude Van Damme (Expendables 2) & Dolph Lundgren (Expendables 2), plus adding Scott Adkins (Expendables 2) and bringing in fight choreographer extraordinaire, Larnell Stovall (Undisputed 3), I could not help but start geekin' out.

Did it live up to the hype I imbued it with?  Yes.  Well, eventually.  Admittedly, I missed a lot the first time I  watched it and was initially disappointed.  It was actually with great reluctance that I gave this a 2nd viewing as soon as I did, and am very glad I did. This isn't really much of a direct continuation in terms of sequence to ""Regeneration"" but takes the same characters to different places, situations and even personalities, some quite drastically. Now, personally, I really dig it when sequels do stuff like that but others may not.  The influence of flicks like ""Apocalypse Now"", and ""The Manchurian Candidate"", combined with various other horror and action ingredients, were all welcome additions.  These components are, however, not without risk.  Hyams runs the gamble of alienating fans of the franchise.  Could someone not familiar with the franchise just pop it in and enjoy it?  Hard to say.  My inclination is toward no but it's definitely possible.

Who ever is responsible for Van Damme & Lundgrens' faces on the cover is on shaky ground, too.  They're barely in it.  It doesn't bother me so much but it's still rude.  Considering it happened on Hyams' most recent film that barely included its cover-boy, Van Damme, I'd have to place blame on the  director.  Or Van Damme.  Lundgren actually has more screen time than he did in ""Regeneration"" but that's not saying much.  Also absent is his character's splendid delivery of existential masochism.  Instead the entire movie has a feel of masochistic existentialism.

The plot?  I'll give the non-complicated version:  Scott Adkins plays John, a man whose sole memory after awakening from a 9-month coma is of Luc Devereaux (Van Damme) murdering his wife and young daughter.  When he is finally discharged from the hospital he goes about finding out who this Deveraux jerk is and what he can do to get revenge on the dude.  Lotsa other stuff ensues, much of it pretty neat.

And how is this action once it finally arrives?  Awesome, gross, intense, disappointing, the list goes on. I am quite a fan of Stovall's choreography.  Especially in flicks like ""Undisputed 3"" and ""Never Back Down 2"".  But if I had a gripe about his work, the use of slow motion is exactly what it would entail.  It was my only complaint about the fights in ""Undisputed 3"".  But while the slo-mo was completely unnecessary in ""U3"", its presence did little harm to the fights.  They are truly some of my favorites. Perhaps all that crap's added in post-production?  I dunno, I'm not a filmmaker.  I just know that as a dude who loves his fight scenes, too much slow motion drives me nuts.  Subtlety is the key.  Same with wires, editing, stunt doubles, etc.  If these things can be used to enhance the action, then I'm all for 'em.  But that's rarely the case. I was warned about the lengthy finale of ""Day of Reckoning""'s excessive slow motion long before I saw it but had heard so many great things in spite of that flaw, I figured it was still worth getting excited about.  Even expecting mega-slo-mo I was still not prepared for that much of it.  A dose I'd call near-fatal.  Poison control suggested I skip back a few scenes to watch the groovy Adkins/Arlovski brawl in the sporting goods store.  A fight scene can tell a story and it's assumed the slow motion is for that reason.  I reckon it's even partially successful.  But it detracted from my overall enjoyment.

The Sony DVD features 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and runs 113 minutes.  English is the only spoken language but subtitles are available in English, English SDH, Spanish.  The specialties include 3 ""making of "" featurettes and commentary with Hyams & Lundgren.

For the 4th movie in a franchise (even though it wisely ignores ""The Return"") this film was taken very seriously by all involved.  Adkins is really good in this.  Some will argue with me on that but I've seen him be bad in other movies and he's not doing that here.  If not for the superfluous slow motion of the last act, this is a 5-star flick.  I can't recommend it without reservations but if you enjoy good action films where imagination triumphs over budgetary restrictions, then, by all means.

5374566,3,B00A0HT94G,"Okay, if you're familiar with the Universal Soldier series then you know that in the movies the United States Military was involved in reanimating deceased soldiers and Marines using super science and turning them into um, Super Soldiers. The soldiers were programmed to obey their superiors without question and also all had the same skill sets so that any one of them could perform a task as well as another. Hence the Universal idea. Well in the first movie a recently dead soldier by the name of Luc Devereux, played by Jon Claude Van Damme managed to fight his programing and go on the run with the movie climaxing in a fight between him and another Universal Soldier who was played by Dolph Lundgren. He managed to kill Lundren's character and the movie ended.

Then you have Universal Soldier: The Return. Which came out in 1998 and despite not being in theaters it was a decent flick. It starred Luc Devereux, again played by Van Damme, who was acting as a consultant for a military operation to make more Universal Soldiers or UniSols but instead of having each one with data in its head they received commands from a central super computer. Well you can pretty much guess what happened what with the computer gaining self awareness and rebelling and using its new army of UniSols to stop all attempts to shut it down. One of the cool things about this movie is that it had Goldberg in it. You might not think that's cool but he had some decent one liners and made a good archenemy.

Fast forward to this year. The latest movie had the feel of a super low budget independent film. The cinematography was reminiscent of the mid 90's, there was very little dialogue, no new cars, and a plot that had absolutely no support. Apparently Luc Devereux is now a bad guy whereas in the first two movies he was a good guy. Dolph Lundgren is now back despite being killed in the first movie and he's now teamed up with Devereux to bring about more UniSols. Only this time its by reproducing. I think they meant cloning but they said reproducing. Anyways, the plot meanders mercilessly and a new UniSol created by the FBI kills Lundgren and Devereux and then takes over their operation. At which point the movie ends. I could explain a bit more but you've probably stopped reading by this point so it would be pointless  :P. Honestly to go more in depth would drag up more regret for having watched this pile of garbage in the first place.

If you had a choice in death between taking arsenic and watching this movie, I would suggest the arsenic. It'll be a lot less painful and much quicker.",1368057600,,2589,4.549356223175966
5374567,4,B00A0HT94G,"Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning follows John after his wife and daughter are murdered by Luc Deveraux. John begins to search for Luc; as he gets closer, he begins to question his memory and his identity. Universal Soldier: DoR is a brutal, action-packed film, although a bit confusing.

The story in this film is interesting; the storytelling, however, was confusing and inconsistent- not to the point of hatred, but to the point of having to ask questions you shouldn't have to. You'll eventually grasp the concept, but the film mostly leaves the audience hanging, especially those that are not familiar with the series. However, if you're looking for an action film, this is a vicious example of what action should be. The action in the film is intense and extremely violent- how much weight this holds, negative or positive, is completely up to you. A lot of the variety in the action, as well; I'm talking intense fist fights, an exceptional bat fight, a bloody knife/machete fight, ultra-violent shootouts, and a destructive car chase- top this off with several epic showdowns, and you have a balanced action flick. The choreography was great, and Scott Adkins does an exceptional job. Despite almost a 2 hour runtime, Dolph Lundgren has little screen time, and Van Damne has even less; Scott Adkins steals the show, and I'm okay with that.

Other than the often confusing story, I also disliked the occasional flashing sequences. Not just in this film, I've never liked scenes with insanely rapid flashing- it's distracting and hazardous to some viewers. I believe this occurs two or three times for about a minute or two, sometimes a flickering aftereffect accompanies these scenes.

Overall, Universal Solider: DoR has superb and varied action sequences, although the confusing storytelling and some editing choices, like the flashing, hurt the film, in my opinion. As of 4/23/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, I recommend a purchase for action fans, and a rental otherwise.

It is the only one of the series that I saw and I don't remember much other than it was OK.  Here, they make brief appearances as leaders of the secret UniSols project.

The headliner this time is Scott Adkins as John who appears to be just another citizen being awoken by his young daughter who hears something downstairs.  It is Luc Devaraux (Van Damme) and a few cutthroats who then torment John with the brutal murder of his family and beat him within an inch of his life.  John lives and of course seeks revenge.  But some things are fuzzy in his head as he mends in his hospital room.

The plot didn't make any sense to me but then I missed all those sequels.  Still, good sequels can usually stand on its own.  This film is not much more than a traditional bad guys vs. good guy blood bath.  I did like some of the fight sequences and clearly Adkins knows what he's doing on the martial arts front.

There's also a guy who I think is the protagonist. He talks a bit, though I'm not sure what much of it was about. It didn't seem too terribly consequential. He wanders about, and gets into fights with Andrei Arlovksi.  Dolph Ludgren and JCVD show up from time to time dressed in ridiculous outfits and/or face paint.

There seems to be an Inverse Law of Universal Soldiering, where only a limited amount of Universal Soldier is available to any given side of a conflict.  So one Universal Soldier by himself is invincible, but an army of them has to split up the available Universal Soldier powers and they end up as cannon fodder.

Eventually the movie turns into Apocalypse Now.

My problem is that once again this franchise doesnt continue from the previous installment. Why? I have no idea. They should have continued the story from regeneration which was a great movie.

5374577,3,B00A0HT94G,"First thing  I want to say regarding the new Universal Soldier movie is that it deserves credit for ripping off Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darknes"", if you're gonna steal, steal from the best, and stealing from Conrad takes  a lot of audacity. Now, of course, this is not Apocalypse Now, it is Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning, what are you expecting, surely not Coppola.
 The fourth in the popular, and admittedly superior action movie franchise. This is a departure from the previous entries. It actually tries to tell a story, something that it unfortunately fails at from time to time, but at least it tries. It comes across murky and confusing at times, but at least it dares to try something different.
 Up and coming martial arts film star Scott Adkins appears to be taking over the franchise as a wounded soldier  with amnesia who's family is murdered by Luc Deveroux (Jean-Claude Van Damme). He doesn't understand why any of this happening or his involvement in the universal soldier program. So he goes down river, I mean he goes after Deveroux in search of answers and finds the once great action hero, a Kurtz like figure for the know awaken unisol soldiers.
 Making Van Damme something of a villain is into itself an inspired idea, like Henry Fonda in Once Upon a Time in the West. we are caught off guard. This is just part of the new darker approach to the series, which I full heartedly welcome.
 Directed by John Hyams, who helmed the worthy previous entry, he seems to have more ambition as a filmmaker than one might expect. He is a good craftsman, and here he shows real promise as a budding auter, at least in the action genre. Future projects, of which I don't know any, from him could be interesting, his father, Peter Hyams is a respectable action and thriller movie technician.
 Universal Soldier: Day of Reckonimg is full of brutal fights, that may turn off some viewers. The action is exciting and well paced, thogh. Adkins makes for an amiable  hero, and is at least as good as Jason Statham, he deserves a really good star vehicle, this isn't it, but it comes close.
 This franchise, like the universal soldiers themselves, seems to never die, and with so many lousy action flicks out there, a strong series like this could be rewarding for the correct audience. If your not that audience, don't bother you know who you are, but if you've been waiting for a good guns and fists action movie since the Expendables 2, this should fill the void, and it actually manages to do something a little different even approaching a respectable dramatic film.

5374586,1,B00A0HT94G,"First off let me say that I have been a huge Jean Claude Van Damme fan since I was 9 years old! I enjoyed watching him in No Retreat No Surrender, Black Eagle, Bloodsport, Cyborg, Universal Soldier series, Lionheart, Legionaire, Double Impact, The Quest, and my all time favorite Kickboxer, plus many more. Now, I was under the assumption form the previous Universal Soldier Movies that it was gonna be a Van Damme ass-kicking fest! I was wrong! This movie is mostly focused on Scott Adkins' character. Scott's acting is ok and has some good action scenes, but he is not the main attraction at least for me, Van Damme is. Van Damme returns as Luc Deveroux, but if you have seen the previous Universal Soldiers, he has ""evolved"" into an entirely different character that quite frankly is super weird and rediculous. You will see what I mean when you watch the movie. Dolph Lundgren appears again and does not have many scenes either. Also, you have Andrei Arlovski playing a Unisol disguised as a plumber that is programmed to take orders from Deveroux telepathically even though Deveroux killed him in the last Universal Soldier flick. Guess he was ressurected. Overall I am very disappointed with this film. Van Damme does not show any of his traditional moves and kicks, maybe he just got old, who knows? If you are expecting Van Damme to go after bad guys and beat the crap out of them like in his classic style, forget about it. This is a weird movie that I just did not quite understand. and for a person to get confused in a Van Damme flick which are pretty much cut and dry, you know you have a bad movie. I liked Street Fighter and Double Team better than this crap or even Desert Heat! Watch this movie at your own risk.",1360627200,3,1729,4.527156549520766
5374587,5,B00A0HT94G,"I enjoy cinema in all its forms. I watch foreign films, I watch surreal films, I watch action films. You name it, I'll give it a try. If a movie can keep me interested enough to watch it in one sitting, then it's doing something right. In that respect, Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning is great. It kept me interested for its entire run time, and then some. But, the thing is this, I'm a huge fan of the original Universal Soldier, and an even bigger fan of Universal Soldier: Regeneration. Both those movies are fantastic in their own respect. Sure, Universal Soldier is really campy by todays standards, but it's still a fun film. Universal Soldier: Regeneration is a truly under appreciated gem of a movie. It's one of those movies that deserves more fame that it has. I really liked the direction that US:R took, and I was hooked with the possibilities.

This is a great movie. It's moody, and the pacing is great. This movie is dripping with attitude. But, to the uninitiated, US:DoR will be confusing and jarring. That's the flaw with this movie. Somebody who just picks this up wanting to see an action flick will be alienated because it's actually pretty artsy. Those looking for a similar movie to the original one will be confused with the ultra-violence going on. US:R was easy to pick up and just watch. It had some great action scenes, pretty good characterization, and an intriguing plot. Day of Reckoning feels more like an experiment than an outright sequel. It seems to me that the director decided to see just how much he could push the envelope of the action/sci-fi genre. I respect that, and I even admire it. But, it won't make many new fans for the series.

Another problem is the unexplained events between Regeneration and this one. I understand Luc Devereaux's evolution as a character. He's free from his shackles, and he's trying to free the rest of the UniSols. But, the story I want to see on screen is how he accomplished this. Scott Adkins is a fine action star with many redeeming qualities as an actor, but I feel more compelled by JCVD's character.

These things aside, I truly did enjoy this movie. It's a great action movie, with some very avante garde aspects. I hope this becomes a cult hit like Regeneration, and I hope they make another one. Should they decide to make another Universal Soldier movie, I sincerely hope that they flesh out Luc Devereaux a bit more.

I'm a big fan of Van Damme so I can personally say that this movie is one of his best performance yet, even if he does have a negative role. But hey, these universal soldiers still are a lean mean killing machine. Scott Adkins (Boyka) also did his superb acting as a vigilante out to destroy them and their brutal fights made it look more as a tremendous masterpiece.

But lately any one who can get a few million together can make a bad movie.. This movie is Horrible on all levels.. The universal soldier franchise is dead. Dolph and Jean should be happy this movie did so bad that they never have to make another one. Scott Adkins is the new wave of action guys and he is barely watchable in this movie. Now don't get me wrong its not like this movie had all bad fight seens. There are three parts to watch and the rest is just filler. Do not watch this movie and think that it has anything to do with the first universal soldier other than a few actors. If you want to truly enjoy the universal soldier movies watch the first two and stop. The rest are not worthy of the name. Going to the movies is supposed to be about escapism and enjoyment.

5374593,4,B00A0HT94G,"This movie is truly MENTAL. I don't really know how Hyams sold the concept of this to the studio execbots: ""yeah, Universal Soldier 4 is going to be a pastiche of loads of common sci-fi tropes -- like clones, body regeneration, implanted memories -- that I'm going to mix in with Kubrickian slomo camera shots, Lynchian psychodrama, and loads of Apocalypse Now. We'll have Van Damme ape Brando's Kurtz and have him walk around a lot mumbling and looking miserable, and not fighting, and Scott Adkins driving around a lot looking miserable, and not fighting, and Dolph chewing up the scenery, and some random big dude with a beard who fights everything. But when it gets violent I'm going to push the violence as far as I can, and I'll also try and offend everyone with my opening sequence. It'll be great, I'm telling ya.""

In all seriousness, this is not a movie for everyone, but I quite frankly loved it. Hyams really does let his imagination run wild on this one, and cheerfully cribs from loads of other directors and movies, but he never seemed to get the memo that this is the fourth in a series of increasingly minor action roles that no one -- save for the odd action junkie fondly remembering movies from his or her childhood/youth -- cares about to any great degree (despite Hyam's great third entry to the series), and tries hard to make this movie anything but your conventional DTV B-movie with ageing action stars.

Day of Reckoning is crass, extremely violent, uneven, and low budget, but it should also be commended for being ambitious, and shot through with passion and creative vision. It is absolutely not a movie for everyone -- if you want a safer trip up action-memory-lane stick with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Expendables-2/dp/B009MF5BXK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Expendables 2</a>&nbsp;-- but if you fancy a detour of the beaten path, and are willing to forgive the flaws that are a consequence of the directorial ambition, then by all means give this a shot.

5374595,5,B00A0HT94G,"I was thoroughly impressed with Day of Reckoning's predecessor Regeneration which threw out the campiness of past offerings, and brought in the finely crafted directorial style of the Hyams team, and an intense explosive journey into the UNISOL world.  It also introduced a significant dose of realism, and real brutal action.

Enter Day of Reckoning, which, in the overall, eclipses in my opinion Regeneration.  I felt that Day of Reckoning bordered on something beyond action and good filmmaking, and achieved something greater.  I felt like I had watched a work of art that explored darkness and grim unsettling brutality in a raw and rhytmic way, without the veneer of comic or glossed over effects.  It has a very hypnotic feel to it that drew me in completely.  The fact that Hyams was able to synthesize these very real dark and human themes into the UNISOL franchise suggests story telling and film making skill far above the norm.

The negative reviews seem to me to be one of two things: that the movie was not actually what the viewer expected it to be.... some campy piece of low budget action trash to mill away 90 minutes on your life on a rainy day (like earlier UNISOL films), or that the trailer and lead up to the film somehow misled the viewer into thinking that Van Damme and Lundgren would have roles as large as their original ones in the earlier franchise offerings.  I am thinking that such criticisms, if that's all they are, indicate a pretty good movie at the core here.

HYams, Van Damme Adkins, and Co., have done something very different.  They made a movie with a vision of human darkness like that explored in Apocalypse Now and movies and books (Conrad, etc... ) like it.  If the Director's name were Scorcese or Coppola and JCVD's and Adkin's names were Brando and Sheen respectively, then this movie would be declared a masterpiece.  Such is the sheepish and finicky nature of the world that judges these works of art. To simply say that this movie is bad or good is not a fair baromoeter to use.  For me, it was good... excellent because of its quality, and the themes explored as well as the acting and effects, and action.  I am still puzzled about a few elements of the film, but rather than that bothering me, it has made re-think about it to see if I understood it all properly... if I got all of the symbolism, and themes that were being presented. It does not mean that the story is left unresolved.  It was not left unresolved, by any stretch.

Adkins does a great job here (actually really great), and JCVD, et al, have really come into their own.  If I am defining the word ""good"" as an action film where the bad guy gets his butt kicked, no questions are asked of anyone, and I go home feeling good all over, then maybe ""Day of Reckoning"" doesn't quite meet that standard.  But if I am judging through the prism I described above, then I think it is a magnificent work.

The violence is unsettling and in many ways disturbing, because if anything it is not fun violence.  It feels real, and it feels consequential.  The movie is dark, very dark, but it is excellent because it doesn't play games.  The movie takes no shortcuts or easy ways out.  It is truly grim, and is one of the best action arthouse films I have seen.  If Hyams and co., are guilty of something, it is delivering entirely against what a fan's expectations are, what they expect from a movie whose basic plot element are regenerated undead soldiers, as campy as that is.  However, Hyams shows this is the perfect premise to deliever something totally unexpected, a blast of raw fury and an unsettling journey into the Heart of Darkness, irrespective of the length of time which its two main legendary action icons have onscreen, which incidentally doesn't feel that small in the totality of the film.

If you are truly looking for a serious action epic with some real thematic exploration, I encourage you to give Day of Reckoning a shot.  I do not think you will be disappointed. Thank you for reading.",1359504000,12,4019,4.592436974789916
5374596,1,B00A0HT94G,"We liked the previous Universal Soldier movies, but this wasn't even truly identifiable as part of the series. You had a couple old cast members - and one scene with a voice talking about the program for maybe a minute.

That was another strange part of the movie - there was hardly any talking through the whole thing. It was quiet - then there was fighting with grunting - then it was quiet - then there was fighting & grunting - then someone said a couple lines . . . It was like the actors were being paid by the word or something.

It was . . . odd camera work as well. Sometimes it was like you were the camera (great way to get sick btw), then there were lots of times were the picture was filled with static - other times where it would flash faster and faster and then go bright white. Definitely don't watch if you're prone to seizures. It was hard to watch at times - you had to look away.

Then there is the violence. This movie seemed to be created for violence alone. I think they must have spent the majority of the budget on fake blood. It was everywhere. Fingers and toes were chopped off, people were stabbed and/or shot multiple times - baseball bats were used to repeatedly beat on people . . . Two guys fought over a beer and a bunch of other guys end up beating one of them until he almost dies . . . It was truly more of a horror flick than an action movie.

You couldn't tell the bad guys from the good guys -- were there any? I'm not even sure. The whole thing didn't make any sense.

Also, if you'd prefer to avoid a lot of nudity - avoid this movie. There are a lot of shots of naked men and women.

He teams up with a dancer (Mariah Bonner) who knows the bad him and they go on an adventure having to fight off a ""Manchurian"" plumber who drives a truck with a self repairing hood.

In order to keep things level, people who could act better than Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren were not considered for roles. All around a fairly sorry film for the franchise. Oh, not ""Halloween 3"" bad, but close.

5374600,3,B00A0HT94G,"Universal Soldier:Day of Reckoning(released Oct/12)has Jean-Claude Van Damme as Luc Deveraux and Dolph Lundgren as Andrew Scott,back in their previous roles. Joining them in the drivers seat is Scott Adkins as John. Scott plays a hard driving and relentless character here,something in the vein of Jason Statham,as a man on a mission.
The story finds Scott being woken up by his daughter claiming there are monsters in the house. When he reaches the kitchen he is repeatedly knocked down by a masked man with a crowbar. After a short time both his wife and daughter are also brought down to the kitchen and are executed before his eyes,by a man who reveals himself as van Damme. Nine months later he awakes in a hospital(the fact that a ""nurse"" who feeds him while he is in bed,then checks him out behind a desk,would lead one to think this is more than just a hospital).He is interviewed by a man claiming he is an FBI agent and to call him if he thinks of anything related to the murders,which of course are indelibly etched in his mind.
Time passes and Scott is indeed released and he goes home to try and find himself. He receives a phone call from a nervous man who knows him and has something for him. When Scott arrives the man is dead. He spots a matchbook on a table with the name of a club on it and heads there and meets up with a girl who knows him,but not visa versa. He gets kicked out but later follows her to her apartment. She has known Scott for quite awhile and has been afraid of his terrible temper,relating a story of beating a man to death. While there a man barges in on them and tries to kill Scott. They both escape but are followed and end the fight in a sporting goods store.
Meanwhile we see that Van Damme is the leader of a Unisol resistance movement and Lundgren is his second lieutenant,if you will. They are trying to free all former and current Unisols from their bondage from the government. It seems Scott is a Unisol,so bred to infiltrate the new Unisol movement and kill Van Damme;though he doesn't know it yet. Scott eventually manages to find the Unisol hideout where they try and remove his implanted memory of his wife and daughter's murders. Something goes wrong while in the chair and he frees himself,kills the lab techs and systematically fights his way through. He dispatches each with particularly devastating skill until he meets with Lundgren. He gives Scott a good run for the money,but Scott comes out victorious. Then it's on to Van Damme. Van Damme and Scott go toe to toe and it all ends there. The film comes to its conclusion as Scott meets up with the FBI agent,who explains that Scott was bred just to kill Van Damme. No one before had succeeded until now. Blaming him for his wife's death,Scott shoots the agent. Anticipating his reaction,out of a nearby van steps out the same agent,then other Unisols,to take away the dead clone(?).
I must say off the top I cannot fault Scott Adkins acting,as he plays his part very well. He wears the part of a confused man,trying to find himself but filled with revenge,like a tee shirt. Unlike the last poor installment,this fourth Universal Soldier(there were two others without Van Damme and company)is much better plot wise and in pace. But someone has to tell me: 1)where in the heck is the franchise going?2)where did it go wrong?and 3)why does van Damme and company continue down this strange road? The first one had Van Damme as a Unisol who in the end snaps out of who and what he is. In the second he is totally in control of himself and has a daughter and even assists with work in the lab. For all intents and purposes he is totally a near normal guy. The last one,after all the time in between,brings Van Damme back as a non speaking drone,who seeing Lundgren,battles it out with him once more. No explanation given whatsoever as to why Van Damme is now a Unisol again. And now they continue in the same very dark vein,but things have obviously evolved and Van Damme is now the leader of a resistance movement,with a shaved head. Watch that head,because when Adkins has his final showdown,JCVD has his head painted white and black! I know this emphasizes where Van Dammes character has ""gone"",but it's all totally nonsensical stuff in the bigger context.
Plot wise,I can see Reckoning as the second installment and the second as the third. The real third installment,well I cannot see it period. My point is neither of these newer Universal Soldier movies are in keeping plot or character wise,with what went on in the first two. So,how in God's creation did we get here and why do they continue down the same dreadful and inexplicable path? I might add,though Van Damme appears here more than the third(which was pitifully small),he appears not MUCH more. JC and Dolph's appearance's are just glorified cameos! Oh yes,watch for Van Damme's son in a bit part as an ""FBI"" agent in the ""hospital"".
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include interviews with Lundgren,Adkins,Van Damme and director Hyams.
All in all while much better than the third installment,this film again sees the entire cast and crew deviating as far away from any connection with the first two movies as they can possibly go. I suggest if you have the first two watch them again,and if you haven't buy or rent them. Then you maybe can explain to me this total digression in characterization and warping of the franchise as a whole.",1359244800,,5467,4.608205128205128

This was another excellent installment in the world of Universal Soldier, and a great follow up to Regeneration! It clearly shows the evolution of the Universal Soldier program and upholds the same style of story telling as the original film.

5374604,4,B00A0HT94G,"Like most I was surprised that ""Day of Reckoning"" shares little with the previous film, ""Universal Soldier: Regeneration"", except an artistry for violence. But if you accept that, it could still be an entertaining and provoking film. You just have to be ready for something moody and disquieting, and something that has finely crafted but totally unglorified combat.

(spoilers below)

The movie is very closely related to ""Apocalypse Now"", and should be interpreted through that lens. The bald Van Damme is Col. Kurtz, and like Kurtz he sees his end coming. Both characters paint themselves in preparation for the sacrifice, and both are killed with the same weapon. But both are willing because they see it as the chance to give their philosophy and purpose to one that might be in a position to act on it. Both Van Damme and the government sent Adkins off on a journey of self-discovery, and their contest was to see who Adkins became when the journey was over.",1359072000,2,964,4.836363636363636

This Movie was in my Opinion Better then the First one Action wise it had a lot more Action and Great Stunt Work and the Acting was Good to 1st of all I have to say the Fighting in this Movie was Frikken Brutal and the Shootouts were Amazing and The Car Chase/Fight as they Call it was AWESOME!to. And as for all you idiots who give this Movie a Bad Review saying it Sucks and whatever else well you can take a Hike cause this Movie was Really Action Packed and I was Suprised it was Good. So People if your Reading this Review Trust Me it is a Film worth Buying if you love Action.,1358812800,,587,3.983050847457627
5374609,3,B00A0HT94G,"Yes, Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren are only on the front cover as a marketing ploy but the real ""star"" of this mediocre action movie is Scott Adtkins. A talented fighter that should only serve as a right hand man of the main villain or hero and not as the main character...ever. And yes, I watched Undisputed III...Scott Adkins at his absolute best and still come away with the opinion that he just does not have the IT factor for me to care about him.

The fighting is really good and in your face. Also, you can actually SEE the fights, the choreography, the punches, kicks, flips and throws unlike ADD editing garbage like Taken 2. In that way, I really did appreciate that and it made the movie go from 0 - 3 stars. It would have gotten another star if it had been as action packed as, let's say, a Raid: Redemption (which is the greatest modern martial arts movie.)

But for some odd reason, there is a drag out story here that neither the director nor the REAL main actor, Scott Adtkins are capable of sustaining any interest from me. This movie really loses steam midway through and only starts to pick up the last 15 minutes of the movie...where Scott Adtkins finally goes all out but by then you'll be eager for the movie to just end.

Also, the reason why I knocked it down to only 3 stars is because Van Damme is in the movie for a total of 5 - 7 minutes altogether. Dolph Lundgren has about 10-15 minutes of screen time altogether. Now, I like Scott Atkins. as a on screen fighter he is great and in many ways more versatile than either Lundgren or Damme but the thing he lacks that they have is screen presence, charisma and...acting skills. LOL. I am sorry to say but Dolph Lundgren and Jean Claude Van Damme are actually better actors than the main protagonist. You know you suck when those two legendary stiffs are better

That's actually unfair, JCVD, has become a relatively good actor, his last couple of movies. And I have been impressed by him for quite sometime. Here, much like Expendables 2, Van Damme is the highlight of the movie and turns in another good performance. Dolph is Dolph here and I have a feeling he and JCVD did this movie because they lost a bet.

The HD quality is really good but nothing mind blowing but the audio was really good. I could hear every gunshot, scream or ammo clip in the movie very well.

None other than Jean-Claude Van Damme's Luc Deveraux, who makes the transition from former movie hero to full-on psycho in a portentous tale of Luc's ""UniSol"" squadron wanting to take over the world...or is it all just a government conspiracy? Paced so slowly that each scene tends to linger on for minutes at a time, with a tone more akin to a horror film than the series' origins, ""Day of Reckoning"" features the requisite Dolph Lundgren cameo and is stylishly shot by Hyams (son of Peter), but the subject matter is so dour that the grim mood eventually overpowers the director's best intentions.

5374618,2,B00A0HT94G,"""Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning"" stars Jean-Claude Van Damme, Scott Adkins, Andrei ""The Pit Bull"" Arlovski and Dolph Lundgren (credited in that order). The new Universal Solider film is directed by John Hyams, responsible for so-so action flick ""Universal Soldier: Regeneration"" (2009) and just plain terrible ""Dragon Eyes"" (2012).

First things first. ""Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning"" is not a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie. Van Damme's role here is only as an extended cameo, and his fight scene is rather brief, and so is that of Dolph Lundgren. I don't even know if I should call it a Universal Soldier movie, as in ""Day of Reckoning"" there is hardly any sci-fi element that was still seen in ""Regeneration.""

Still I expected something exciting from the film as the star of ""Day of Reckoning"" is Scott Adkins, who can really do action. Adkins plays a man named John, who, heavily injured, wakes up in a hospital to learn that his beloved wife and daughter were brutally murdered by masked intruders. So far, so good.

As the story goes on, however, it becomes clear that the film is going nowhere. Action is brutal and gory (that's fine), but terribly drawn-out and poorly edited. The confusing story (including the lengthy non-action opening scene that should be much shorter) doesn't make much sense. There is one decent car action sequence, but ... is Scott Adkins, a martial artist, hired for this?

As you know, Van Damme, Adkins and Lundgren were also seen in ""The Expendables 2."" They are just part of the cast, but they did much better jobs there.",1355616000,2,1568,4.883458646616542

The action is great though, especially near the end with the Slow-mo, that entire scene was just awesome, perfectly shot and they didn't overuse the Slow-mo like in say, Walker Texas Ranger or something. Anyway thats my review, this is an interesting and pretty cool installment into the Universal Soldier. Very recommended to check out if you're a fan of the stars or just cool, fun oldschool action.

As someone who watched the original UniSol with admiration of the concept of deeply buried black government forces for the rare missions of last resort, this latest installment just seems self serving and without purpose.

The script and dialog is terribly predictable, thankfully we're given just the build up to some potentially heinous moments of violence against the most innocent, BUT THERE ARE MULTIPLE STROBE LIGHT SCENES WORTHY OF WARNING TO THE EPILEPTIC and anyone else JUST affected/annoyed by strobe lights.

Instead, this movie isn't even a Universal Soldier movie. Seriously. I sat down and watched them all in a row, concluding with this film, and everyone in the room was devastated. We went from all of us having a great time, to the night taking a serious turn for the worse with this movie.

Scott Adkins does a solid job in the movie, similar to his performances in a number of other films. I'm hoping his career will take off, but movies like this aren't going to help that happen. Lundgren seemed like he had fun making the movie, and was fun to watch. Van Damme was terrible, but it seemed like for the most part that was because of the script. The Deveraux character is completely wasted and destroyed in this movie. Really it's not even Luc Deveraux, but just some poorly conceived Colonel Kurtz rip off.

Don't waste your time with this dreck. Watch Universal Soldier, then Universal Soldier: Regeneration, and be happy that the series ended on that high note.

5374627,4,B00A0HT94G,"Universal Soldier: Day Of Reckoning is a semi-sequel to the most recent film in the series; Universal Soldier: Regeneration. The film doesn't follow the story of Regeneration and is a spin off as much of a sequel in the series as it introduces a new story and characters to follow.

The only part of the film that is connected to the last one is the clones. In the last film they introduced cloning into the series and this movie revolves around the US Government creating dozens and dozens of Universal Soldier clones that act as spies and assassins for the feds.

The lead of the entire series, Luc Deveraux (Jean Claude Van Damme), is a supporting character this time out. Its my biggest problem with this film. Van Damme kills it in every scene he is in, but he is in the film for maybe 10 minutes at best and doesn't say much until the end. He is the ""villain"" of the movie, seeking out and recruiting these US gov't made clones and turning them to his cause.

The real lead of the movie is John (Scott Adkins) who wakes from a coma at the beginning of the movie. The only thing he remembers from before his coma is his family being murdered by the Unisols and Deveraux. Seeking payback, John begins to look into his past and seek Deveraux out to avenge the deaths of his family.

Sounds like an old fashioned revenge story, but the movie isn't as simple as that. The best way to sum up the movie is that its a cross between Death Sentence and Apocalypse Now. The similarities aren't hard to notice either as Van Damme's character is a not so subtle version of Colonel Kurtz.

John Hyams, who directed this movie and the previous movie Universal Soldier Regeneration, stages some incredible fight scenes and this is a pretty impressive attempt at trying to take the series in a new direction. Adkins in particular has some great fight scenes with all of the principle cast members and does some great long single take fight scenes where he is just beating up guy after guy with no cuts. The Van Damme/Adkins fight scene in particular is great to watch

But the film ultimately comes up short compared to Regeneration for a few reasons. Adkins, as impressive a performance as he is in the movie, just isn't a strong enough actor to carry the movie. He can handle any action scene but he doesn't have the ability yet to handle the dramatic weight that the role requires. Another deals with Van Damme's role in the movie. The star of the entire franchise; this time around he has maybe 10 minutes of screen time total in the movie and he doesn't say anything until the final minutes of the movie. Even in his small role he manages to completely overshadow Adkins and anyone else in the movie. Lundgren is in the film even less than Van Damme is. Roy Jones pops up in the film for about one minute as well. Andrei Arlovski returns from the last movie as well and, probably for the best, still doesn't have any lines.

It probably would have been a better movie if it was Van Damme in the lead still. But this isn't his story this time around. The story is the art house version of Universal Soldier. I know its apart of the mystery of the story, but they would have been better off focusing more on the JCVD and his army of soldiers than having them take up 10% of the movie. They was more intrigue in watching than John's journey. The ending is also pretty agitating as well. That is where the Apocalypse Now comparisons become less subtle. Its not a clear ending for me that will hopefully change the next time I watch it. It has ending that can be interpreted in a couple different ways. I think I'm going to watch when it comes out in theaters at the end of this month. Its an entertaining and intriguing movie and if you like great action or is a fan of the series then you should check it out.",1352332800,5,3800,4.396870554765291
5374628,4,B00A0HT94G,"This movie contains very graphic violence, full frontal male and female nudity, graphic prostituticide, lots of gore including an improvised brain surgery scene, graphic Dolph Lundgren...what?  Do you need more reasons?  How about Scott Adkins fighting EVERYBODY!?!  Pure fun reignites this franchise to and beyond its former glory.

During a home invasion, family man John (Scott Adkins; The Expendables 2, Assassination Games) gets his head used as crowbar batting practice and is forced to witness the murder of his family at the hands of Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme; The Expendables 2, Dragons Eyes)--who looks perfectly villainous, sleek and creepy with his new skinhead haircut.  John later awakens from a 9-month coma in a high tech facility.

Meanwhile, Lt. Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren; The Expendables 2, Universal Soldier: Regeneration) is up to something, ""freeing"" other Unisols with some deprogramming (or reprogramming) video injection.  It gets a little confusing here.  Life made more sense when his insanity was limited to crafting ear necklaces.  John starts having visions of Deveraux, so we assume he was injected at some point...or something.  So are Deveraux and Scott working together?

As John investigates he finds that he has done things he doesn't recall doing and people he doesn't know seem to know him quite well--like stripper Sarah (Mariah Bonner; Freerunner), who helps him out with his identity sleuthing.  It seems he was quite a violent guy who many feared.  He even learns who his ""boss"" is, which comes as quite a surprise.  The fun surprise comes during the ""athletics store fight,"" where John is losing a fight to a Unisol until he suddenly discovers his Unisol combat abilities; because you don't put Scott Adkins in a Universal Soldier movie and NOT have him rock out.  More surprises come along, most heavily at the end.

The action in the end segment is really great.  John goes ape-crap rabid postal on a rogue Unisol compound with some nihilistic mantra about ""taking back what's theirs.""  He takes down Andrew Scott in a serious fight with a devastatingly clever Dolph-blow, and against Deveraux, in some of the creepiest commando face paint ever, he has yet another major fight complete with multiple exchanges on bone-impaling machete strikes.

Director John Hyam (Universal Soldier: Regeneration, Dragon Eyes) has developed a fine knack for making the most out of humbly budgeted action flicks.  I'm guessing it's just to please JCVD, but among his common actors is Kristopher Van Varenberg (Van Damme's son; Dragons Eyes) in a tiny role.  I'll let it pass.  If that's what it takes to get this level of Van Damme-ity, it's worth it.

I really have a hard time believing this movie will actually be released in theaters... Pretty sure it's going straight to DVD, in true Van Damme fashion.

Basically what I'm saying is don't waste your money. It's really really bad...",1351900800,,368,4.411764705882353
5374630,2,B00A0HT94G,"Credit again to John Hyams on the production values of Day Of Reckoning considering the budget, however, this felt like an art house vision for a Universal Soldier movie. What the makers went for, I felt, would be in a similar vein to 'Drive' with Ryan Gosling. Another movie that I did not enjoy by the end.

I'm a big fan of Universal Soldier: Regeneration. It was a breath of fresh air among all the PG-13 movies in 2009 and a performance best for Van Damme in many years excluding JCVD. For it to turn out as well as it did considering it was a direct to DVD sequel to a 17 year old movie, is even more note worthy to the talents of John Hyams.

Back to Day Of Reckoning. First thing to note is that this a Scott Adkins movie. Van Damme is not in this much at all. Most of the scenes he is in excluding the last 10 minutes with his showdown with Adkins, he has little to no dialogue and amount to maybe 6 or 7 minutes total. Lundgren has more screen time but not by much and doesn't share any scenes with Van Damme. Or I just don't remember if they did. Day Of Reckoning could very easily have been called Universal Clones. It has little to almost nothing to do with Universal Soldier or Universal Soldier: Regeneration other than the same actors appear in character name only. I would say that this is not even a sequel. To categories it, I'd say that it is an alternate story involving cloned Universal Soldiers who resemble the Universal Soldiers from Regeneration in physical appearance only.

The violence in Day Of Reckoning is incredibly brutal to the point where it just is not enjoyable. It goes beyond the violence in Regeneration, think 'Drive' brutality again. By the end of the movie, Scott Adkins character infiltrates the Unisol compound and takes then all out, again in incredible brutal gun battles and hand to hand combat. The problem I had was why should I care? Without going into spoilers, there really isn't any point to Scott Adkins quest to seek revenge given the reveal which was no surprise. If I don't care about the main characters quest I have no emotional investment in whether Scott Adkins kills everyone or whether everyone else kills Scott Adkins. I just wanted the movie to be over.

Day Of Reckoning goes about telling a very simple story in a very confusing manner. To go into the plot to much would be to essentially give away the movie. Basically, Guy A is manipulated into killing Guy B and that's pretty much it. Due to how the script has events unfold, at the end I had more questions than answers about what I just watched and little of it made sense. There are allot of plot holes, character actions that just happen because that's how it's scripted and unanswered questions left hanging in the same manner that came about after watching Prometheus. Is this lazy writing or delusions of sophistication.

The very last scene seems to contradict the entire motivation of Van Damme's character and the events of the prior 1 hour and 40 minutes. Several references are made to a crate, a crate containing something vital to Van Damme's character and the Unisol's, to allow them to replicate. How then was Scott Adkins character able to replicate the character they did at the end when he also did not have the crate??? Did he get the crate? Another question, what was the point of the swap? And yet another question, are the Unisol's now a new race? These are some of many unanswered questions I had by the end and during the movie.

In short, if you enjoyed Universal Soldier and Universal Soldier:Regeneration, I would go so far as to say that Day Of Reckoning is not going to provide to you what you are looking to enjoy. Some will disagree but I'd have to recommend that this be a rental before a blind purchase. If on the other hand you are one of the many who enjoyed 'Drive' and had an interest in Universal Soldier: Regeneration, then the mix of styles in Day Of Reckoning and as a new take on the Universal Soldier franchise, this could be for you.",1351728000,7,4000,4.487637362637362
5374631,4,B00A0HT94G,"Even though I give this 4 stars, I have to admit that this film leaves me with some mixed reactions.  If you've never seen any of the prior films, that either puts you way ahead or leaves you at a severe disadvantage.  Why? Because this film doesn't fill in very much in terms of backstory for the antagonists, it leaves their agenda and motivations somewhat ambiguous.  Having seen all of the prior entries into the series, well, it gives you enough knowledge and insight into the characters to fill in the blanks and leave you somewhat satisfied.  HOWEVER, at the same time, it is such a huge departure from the other films that with the exception of the cast and character names, it almost seems like a different franchise.

As others have mentioned, if you're planning to watch this for Van Damme or Lundgren, you WILL be disappointed.  Scott Adkins however gives a solid performance as a man whos lost everything except a need for payback.  His portrayal of ""JOHN"" is suprisingly moving, and Andrei Arlovski as his main opponent (despite his being in the immediate prequel) was an inspired choice.  All of the fight scenes with these two are top notch, and have just enough tension to keep it exciting.  While JCVD and Dolph have very little screen time, they too deliver solid jobs that are reminiscent of the very first UNISOL film, and if I have any complaint, its that these two, for whatever reason, have very little time to shine despite their getting top billing.

The plot has its holes, but again, what throwback style action flick doesn't? The almost complete reversal of the standard UNISOL discovery plot plays out well with (SPOILER AHEAD) ""JOHN"" slowly discovering that maybe he's not who or what he thinks he is.  The pacing is excellent and it has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing (SOMEWHAT).  There are a few shocks and suprises, but you'll probably see a few of the ""twists"" a mile away.

The fight choreography is excellent.  There isn't a single fight scene that disappoints.  If you're expecting a ballet or a ton of wire work though...don't.  These fights are a lot more MMA than Crouching Tiger and for every perfectly executed kick, theres some ground and pound or outright brawling.  The cinematography is suprisingly good for a action film and there's enough visual variety to each location that the scenes never get stale.

All in all, like I said before, I have mixed feelings on the film.  Having seen the prior entries, it doesn't FEEL like a UNISOL film, but it's definitely a fun film and possibly a breakout role for Scott Adkins.  Go in without too many expectations, and this may suprise you.",1351382400,5,2644,4.718954248366013
5374632,2,B00A0HT94G,"Okay, I'm not going to go in too much in depth about this movie cuz the other reviews have done a very fine job describing it and giving an accurate review regarding production, story, bla bla bla.  I just want to say that for a casual evening,  this movie was a surprise and a dissapointment at the same time.  Surprise because its the kind of action flicks that we no longer see.  Now it's all about remakes, super heroes, excesive CGI, you know how that goes.  Dissapointment??  well, I'm a big JCVD fan, and big Dolph Lundgren fan,  so why the hell are these 2 icons on the movie poster???? Someone should tell the Producers that they are still in time to change the poster before the theatrical release because this is false advertisement and its misleading!  these 2 hardly have a decent scene on the whole movie!!! not to mention the ridiculous screen time they get.  JCVD and Lundgren performances in this movie are a joke.  So, don't get me wrong,  its a very nice action movie with great fight scenes, but if you are like me that you were catched by Jean Claude's stare on the poster promising those amazing 360 aerial kicks....  don't waste your time man!

5374633,3,B00A0HT94G,"The key word is spinoff. My favorite remains The ORIGINAL. Next is Regeneration. Reckoning is on a par with 2. Emotion is generated by the human side of the UNISOL. The rediscovery of that side is best (IMHO) in the ORIGINAL. Adkins may not have been given latitude here through direction or ability (my opinion) but I feel no empathy for his character. I always felt that for Van Damme's. Heck, I even wanted Van Damme to beat the snot out of Stallone in Expendables 2. Conflict is one scene after another, but the buildup sputters and we find out why Undisputed 2 was so good (It was Carried by Michael Jai White) beyond the choreographed acrobatic fight scenes. Nevertheless, I'll support this because of the lights of Van Damme and Lundgren.",1351296000,2,745,4.651515151515151
5374634,4,B00A0HT94G,"I REALLY LOVED this movie. The vibe was just so different compared to most action movies that come out...and it looked 100% theatrical to me. Looked great in HD too. I can't believe Hyams can churn out these movies with such small budgets. The slow burn that lead to all the action scenes was perfect for the tone of the film. Once the action starts, we are treated to INSANELY VIOLENT and BRUTAL fight pieces which are masterfully executed. My main flaw was the overuse of slow mo in the climax tracking shots. It was still bad ass but it would have packed a bigger punch without it. I knew not to expect a traditional Unisol movie so that aspect didn't ruin anything for me...and honestly, I like Hyams trying new things instead of just making the same movie over and over again like most big Hollywood directors do. He knew he only had a little money to use and he wanted to create something really special with it...and I think he succeeded admirably. The first Unisol will always be my favorite but DOR slightly edges out Regeneration for me because of the unsettling Horror/Noir atmosphere. Just as how Regeneration was my favorite action movie of the 2010, I think DOR will me my favorite of 2012...and both movies came out the same year as an Expendables movie and destroyed them both. 4.25/5",1351296000,3,1300,4.583690987124464

8545883,5,B00A0HT94G,"I bought this because one of the user reviews said this dual English/French version from Canada contained the Unrated version. In the USA, only the R-rated edited version is available. I have now received this product and can verify it is the Unrated version! I was a little worried when I saw the case, because the Canadian rating is ""16+"", and it has an ""R"" rating (but not with the usual American MPAA logo). But I put the movie in and compared it to the online guide and it has all the stuff missing from my American copy.

For anyone who hasn't seen it, this movie is amazing. A violent, surreal nightmare of a sci-fi action film that transcends the UniSol series. This is the movie that introduced me to Scott Adkins and now he is one of my favorite performers. Some people were disappointed that Van Damme and Lundgren have small roles and that Van Damme is antagonist instead of the hero, but it is all part of the unique story this movie is telling and the screen time they do get is some of the most impressive work of their careers.",1514937600,2,1043,4.404145077720207
