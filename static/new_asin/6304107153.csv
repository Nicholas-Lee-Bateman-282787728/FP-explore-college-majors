All the cartoon are excellents but hard-to-find (only in old VHS or VCD) but ALL the fanatics of Looney Tunes want this compilation in DVD!!!!!!!!!

7862438,2,6304107153,"Chuck Jones continues to entertain new audiences with the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote. Chariots of fur is an blend of his final cartoon with the duo. I found it to be very exciting. If you have Road Runner vs. Wile E. Coyote The Classic Chase from Warner Bros. Golden Jubiliee 24 Karat collection, this video might not be for you. The other five cartoons actually appear on that video; Zip N' Snort, Operation: Rabbit, Hook, Line and Stinker, Beep Beep, and Ready, Woolen and Able. Otherwise this is an very nice cartoon video collection for kids of all ages.",1003536000,7,562,4.574257425742574
