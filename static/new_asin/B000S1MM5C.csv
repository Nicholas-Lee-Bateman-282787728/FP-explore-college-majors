2879035,5,B000S1MM5C,"I was highly amused to watch an advance review copy of this DVD set, having been entertained on and off since the Sixties by Robert Klein's intelligent, articulate, surrealistic comedy.

This DVD set - as far as I know the only available DVD of Klein's performances - is a reasonably priced, very comprehensive (close to eight hours over four decades) and extremely amusing perspective on Robert's long career. It's clear that he has not stood still as a man or a comedian, and it's interesting for a fan to see his development and growth. His considerable gift for mimicry, effortless and constant segues, and sarcastic commentary on contemporary affairs will keep you laughing.

Some of my favorite pieces were his soulful ode to colonoscopies, sung in a Manilow-ish manner; Pat Boone doing Little Richard songs (hilarious), the search for John Wayne Bobbitt's lost member...this is a man who has found humor in many areas of life, delivers it with great lan, and shows no sign of slowing down! He's a pretty good singer and harmonica player, into the bargain.",1187049600,28,1062,4.927374301675978
2879036,5,B000S1MM5C,"I have always enjoyed Robert Klein and his sense of humour. It borders on the ridiculous which is right up my street. This whole set is worth watching and very, very funny.",1279152000,,172,4.40625
2879037,3,B000S1MM5C,"I got the pack and the top corner was all crumpled, then when I opened it, 2 of the 3 plastic things that held the DVD's in place were broken.

While I am a collector of comedy DVD's, I decided that the month turn around in getting a new one wasn't worth it - the DVD collection itself is great. I am powering through the specials.

If you haven't seen ""I Can't Stop My Leg"" it is genius and I love that he calls back to it. You can see why Klein is so highly regarded among the current top shelf of comics - Seinfeld and that crew.

While the jokes themselves aren't always strong, it is his delivery and his theatricality and intelligence as a performer that make him a stand-out stand-up for all to admire.",1239321600,5,709,4.160583941605839
2879038,5,B000S1MM5C,"If you know Robert Klein, and you want to get some fabulous performances, this is what you're looking for.  It's almost all here, as funny and crisp as Day 1, and spanning years of his work.  You get a great overview of him and his evolution as a comic.  If time permitted, I'd go out, get some easy-sleazy food, and just hunker down and watch the whole production start to finish- a great project, or lost weekend!

If you're not as familiar with Klein, this is a chance to see a master at work.  His incisive observations about human behavior, corporate entities, and a slew of other stuff is top notch.  He's great at spotting and giving voice to things everyone knows but no one talks about.  It's cool too that he comes at you working on the assumption that you are a thinking individual.  I'm no prude (love Kinison), and have no issues with blue language, but it's a bonus that Klein's creativity permits him to work without it.  There's nothing gratuitous here, no running down of other people, no perjoratives or cusses, yet he's no goody-goody with a delightfully evil and nimble mind.  Watching him, you'll see the basis for many of today's stand-ups.  You go away thinking you'd love to have him over some time or as a friend.

My only regret is that Robert Klein and George Carlin couldn't have a child together.  That'd be an amazing kid, but who'd be able to raise it?",1236556800,,1383,4.506024096385542
2879039,5,B000S1MM5C,"This is what every Robert Klein fan would want.
All of his great stuff in one package.
Totally funny and original.",1216512000,,114,4.476190476190476
2879040,5,B000S1MM5C,"Robert Klein is the King. I have been waiting for this set just for the colonoscopy song, but in the end it was but a morsel of a delicious comedy cake. Robert Klein does not do dated material, he doesn't need to use F*** and cognates, he doesn't need N***** and cognates. This is pure comedy born of life and ageless",1211846400,3,317,4.213114754098361
2879041,5,B000S1MM5C,"Wow, I'm sure glad this set was released. I've always loved Robert Klein, and bought his ""Child of the 50's"" CD about fifteen years ago. I'd only seen two of his HBO specials from the 80's (we couldn't afford HBO in the 70's and early 80's), but I'd always remembered them well. For some reason Robert Klein hasn't remained in the public consciousness the way George Carlin has, but I think of them as similar (and both very funny). This collection is really a smokin' deal, considering that it's over 8 hours of material and most of it was never released before, even on VHS.
This collection would be even better if it included his comedy CD's, some of which are out of print. But that's a minor complaint. For the money, this collection is a steal.",1211155200,3,750,4.481751824817518
2879042,5,B000S1MM5C,"Jerry Seinfeld has acknowledged Robert Klein as a strong early influence.  I'll go one better.  I think Klein is the link between Lenny Bruce and Jerry Seinfeld.  Where Bruce was truly an iconoclastic social critic and Seinfeld is a brilliant observer who we seem to know very little about personally, with Klein one comes away feeling as though they've learned something about the culture and quite a bit about the man.  Despite our 20 years' difference in ages, I feel like I grew up with Klein and his HBO specials.  (Now I can finally have pristine copies of the videotapes that I have prized for the last 25 years!)

Klein's artistry is in his fluid descriptions of the large and small details of life in America and how they influenced his thinking.  He is articulate and incisive, but can be vulgar when needed.  If you watch this DVD in chronological order you come away with a true appreciation for his dedication to his craft, and his willingness to stretch himself and expose himself over the years.  While he is not as outrageous as Carlin (who often resorts to extreme, almost unbelievable hyperbole to make his comedic points), he is every bit as intelligent, and just as funny.

More than anything, I come away with a sense of this artist's humanity and I can relate and laugh my head off.  Also included are all his great,  underappreciated musical numbers, including various versions of ""I Can't Stop My Leg,"" ""Colonoscopy"" and ""The Bronx is Beautiful.""

This is the best DVD I""ve bought in a long time.  If you're looking for who turned Seinfeld on to comedy, check out Robert Klein. He's the real thing.",1209081600,4,1622,4.705673758865248
2879043,5,B000S1MM5C,"Robert Klein has been a major influence in my life and I didn't realize it. I even bought a pair of blue and white saddle shoes in the 70s. One day I was listening to my comedy records and I discovered how much of my sense of humor was based on Klein's jokes and observations. Although I always liked George Carlin too, his accurate observations of human behavior can be quite depressing at times. Robert Klein makes you think, but he never gets you down.

I missed most of these shows when they were originally aired on HBO and after hearing them years later, I think they hold up well in the 21st Century, especially for a Child of the 50s.",1205452800,12,642,4.305785123966942
2879044,5,B000S1MM5C,"Since age 13, I have been entertained by Robert Klein's HBO specials.  At one point I'm pretty sure I had ""Robert Klein at Yale"" and ""Child of the 50's, Man of the 80's"". nearly memorized.  ""Robert Klein on Broadway"" was almost memorized as well.

Up to this point there was no way to watch his specials except at HBO's whim.  Then, if you weren't an HBO subscriber, you were left high and dry.  I always knew there were early and late specials I had never seen. Finally, I can see the entire corpus of his work.

What a treasure.  Thank you Robert Klein!!!",1197936000,6,557,4.349514563106796
2879045,5,B000S1MM5C,"This is a terrific retrospective of Robert Klein's ever-evolving talent. I'm particularly pleased to get to see his early HBO shows; as Robert said on Jay Leno, in those days HBO had fewer than a half million subscribers, so these are rare films indeed. Here's a very smart, perceptive, multi-talented artist with a splendidly creative, wicked wit and a flowing inspiration. No surprise Leno treated him with great respect; most of the great comics, Seinfeld and Romano for example, feel very much the same.",1193011200,10,507,5.0476190476190474
