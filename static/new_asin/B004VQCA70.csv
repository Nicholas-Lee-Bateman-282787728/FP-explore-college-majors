4483732,5,B004VQCA70,"I love anything with Colin Morgan in it, so this gets rave reviews from me.  He is a brilliant actor with a long career ahead of him.",1369785600,,133,3.925925925925926
4483733,5,B004VQCA70,"This is a wonderful film based on an intriguing novel. The film is entirely true to the mood of the novel.  The island itself, it has been said, is actually a character in the film.  The sounds of sea, surf, and wind predominate.  The scenes of sea and sky and wind swept hills are beautifully filmed.

The actors are excellent.  Colin Morgan's portrayal of Calum is nothing short of exquisite.  It is melancholy and, yet, hopeful.  It has become a favorite of mine, which can be experienced over and over and over again.  The accents can be a little tough for us Americans.  The more you hear it, the easier it becomes.  I highly recommend it.

I would caution, however.  This is definitely an adult film for many reasons, all of which I will not mention here.  But, among others, there is the rough language used by the character, Nikki, which is completely in character for someone who absolutely has reason to be angry and spiteful.  Also, there is a sequence with an ocean storm that is particularly harrowing and would be certain to be frightening to a young child. The BBC has wisely rated this viewing: not younger than 15 years.

That being said for the parents, this film will remain one of my favorites for years to come.",1366934400,12,1232,4.536363636363636

4483736,4,B004VQCA70,"Whoa! This is a bit troubling and disturbing. Strange. Morgan, as the troubled young man, is really good. Not an ""enjoyable"" movie!",1444780800,,131,5.0
4483737,5,B004VQCA70,Colin Morgan was brilliant as usual!,1441756800,,36,5.166666666666667
4483738,5,B004VQCA70,The actors were great. The location was breath taking. The director wanted to show how the isolation of the island. I don't want to give away the plot. Must be seen.,1440979200,,165,4.354838709677419
4483739,5,B004VQCA70,"Not a thriller as a reviewer led me to believe. A subtle, dark brooding story that ends on an unexpected ray of sweetness and hope. Colin Morgan is brilliant.",1440720000,,158,4.482758620689655

4483741,4,B004VQCA70,"I bought this film because it starred Colin Morgan who I feel is an up and coming actor and I wanted to see if he could deliver and he did.  He became well know in his role of Merlin in the BBC series of the same name.  In the last disc of the series, when he was asked what he wanted to do in the future, he said that he wanted challenging roles. Well,  he has found them.  I found he in ""Parked"" where he plays a young man on drugs who befriends a homeless man (Colm Meany) and this story ""Island.""  This is a dark tale in every sense of the word.  The scenes are all dark in almost a black and gray background.  It revolves basically three people. Nikki Black who is a very angry 39 year old woman who was raised in the orphan/foster system who has found out who her birth mother is and who has set out to find out why she was given up and then to kill her.  She meets up with her mother under the guise of doing research of the area.  Her mother Phliss Loverage has a son Calum MacLoud.  The film is very slow moving as it should be as this is not an action thriller with car chases and buildings being blown up but more a suspense film.. There are two surprises at the end.that should make you shout ""What!""  I give it a four star",1419638400,2,1235,3.9595141700404857
4483742,5,B004VQCA70,"I first watched this movie because it has Colin Morgan in it, but I have since become a convert to the story, to the point where I bought the book! I find it not a pleasant story, but a very human one. I like the psychology of the story. From the first sentence we know that someone is doomed! To describe it any further would give the whole story away!",1419552000,,353,4.057142857142857
4483743,3,B004VQCA70,"I think Colin Morgan is an amazing actor, but I didn't think the film really complimented him. He certainly made it worth watching for his was the highlight of the movie.  To be fair...I just finished the ""Merlin"" series and loved every episode!  I may go back and watch it again:)",1416096000,,281,4.490196078431373
4483744,4,B004VQCA70,"Colin Morgan's performance was sublime. You can see that he gave it his 110% in every scene. The plot itself is dark and sometimes there are things missing, like some background information but overall it is a harrowing experience and sort of leaves you in suspense right after the ending.",1413504000,,289,4.8
4483745,5,B004VQCA70,"Loved this movie.  Excellent story line and great acting.  However there is something about Colin Morgan.  His acting is so good he truly becomes the character he is portraying.  I cannot think of another actor that could be as good in any of the roles he has played.  If there is a current that runs through each portrayal it is gentleness and likability.  That might not be so if another actor had played the same part.
He could easily succeed with his beautiful face and gorgeous smile but he has chosen to be an exquisite actor.  He is mesmerizing to watch.  You will love him in this movie. The sad part for other actors in a movie with Colin is all I wanted to watch was him.",1409270400,,681,4.307086614173229

4483750,5,B004VQCA70,"Definitely worth watching, although the ""F"" word is used frequently...not really keen on that....but really sweet story line and Morgan and Press put out excellent performances both individually and together.  This show is very dark and moody with a surprise ending.",1406419200,,266,5.487804878048781

4483752,2,B004VQCA70,"Bored out of my mind!  I gave it two stars for Colin Morgan (Merlin) he did a very good job with his part, his was the only character I could even care about.  The rest of this cast is about as exciting as watching grass grow, I did it and the grass growing is more exciting. Angry girl put up for adoption, many years later wants to kill her mother and she finds her and a brother. There you have it. Now let me say something about the horrible acting job that Natalie Press did. shrill and a shrew. I must confess I made it 64 minutes before I turned it off. Oh another reason for the 2 stars...the island scenery (the Hebrides) are beautiful. That's all",1403827200,,656,4.15748031496063
4483753,3,B004VQCA70,A potentially great movie damaged by a flawed script and/or clumsy direction. A viewer shouldn't have to read a synopsis before viewing to really appreciate a movie.,1402444800,,165,5.148148148148148
4483754,4,B004VQCA70,I couldn't put it down.  This character takes you with her all the way even though it sounds like it could be frightening.,1396224000,,122,4.304347826086956

4483756,4,B004VQCA70,This was a great movie.  I enjoyed the movie and think Colin is a fantastic actor as well as Janet.  I will definitely pick up the book and read it as well.  I would recommend this movie.,1394150400,,187,4.0
4483757,4,B004VQCA70,"I read the book and I admire Colin Morgan and Janet McTeer as actors, so wanted to see this movie.  The actors didn't disappoint and a fantastic bonus was the location - a star turn by Scottish scenery.  Only the end was a little weak.  It is clear in the book that a great sacrifice is made and a redemption of sorts achieved. This was entirely missing in the film. That cost it a star, but if you buy and read the book too you can work it out for yourself.",1393718400,,458,4.010989010989011
4483758,5,B004VQCA70,"I enjoyed the movie very much. I am an avid fan of Colin Morgan and it was nice to see him as a entirely different character from ""Merlin"" and his character in ""Parked.""",1392163200,,169,4.151515151515151

4483762,5,B004VQCA70,"Interesting story, loved the book, enjoyed the movie even more! You will like it if you are into dark sad mysterious stories.
I was able to play the disc on my computer (no pal player). The sound is OK, but no subtitles.",1381363200,,220,4.261904761904762
4483763,4,B004VQCA70,"This was a lot darker than I expected and they left one major part of the show rather ambiguous which makes it disturbing.  Wonderful acting on the part of Colin Morgan, of course.  I would never call it a fairy tale.  Natalie Press also did a good job playing her part.  I am not familiar with her as an actress; I bought this so I could watch Colin Morgan, to scrutinize his talent.  The setting is perfect in making this a dark and foreboding film.  Overall, if you like dark, psychological thrillers, this movie won't disappoint you.",1377043200,,537,4.484536082474227
4483764,5,B004VQCA70,"This movie is about a young girl searching for her birth mother...and revenge. Along the way, she finds her biological mother and a brother she never knew she had set amongst the background of a mysterious island. The movie starts with Nikki sharing a fairy tale, which plays beautifully into the movie later on. (won't say too much, don't want to ruin it). The movie carries on through Nikki, the main character, and what kind of life she's had since being abandoned at birth. Containing various flashbacks of life as a kid in the foster care system, her past is bleak, painful and riddled with dark undercurrents. When she finds birth mother, she is very cold and uncaring of anyone or anything but her son Calum, Nikki's half brother played by Colin Morgan. Nikki's anger is palpable, but she manages to keep most of it hidden. You can't help but feel for Nikki despite her wish to want her mother dead. Colin Morgan does a FANTASTIC job (also with a new, really convincing accent as well) as her strangely eccentric, head in the clouds half brother who wonders the cliffs near the seas. He shares fairy tales/folk stories with Nikki and shows her about the island, all while collecting little trinkets, bottles, shoes, whatever ""treasures"" he finds. He plays this part with so much honesty and adorable, child-like naivete he can't help but become your favorite of the movie. Natalie Press plays Nikki with so much stifled anger, yet clever manipulation you are actually with and behind her most of the way. However, how far will Nikki go to get the truth?

This is a truly great movie, but it has some disturbing elements to it. So be aware, this should probably be viewed by adults only. Still, as a whole, I loved this movie and have watched it more than once. My particularly favorite part is the end and I might have that part set on replay! Should check this out, worth the buy!",1372896000,5,1888,4.635820895522388
