8324422,3,B0000ACOY8,"When I first saw this dvd in a store's movie bargain bin, I thought, ""Oh, cool! Two cheap-o, cartoon wolf moives with a bonus Moby Dick one!"" Unfortunately, the one I picked up was in Spanish. I don't know Spanish all that well, so I thought I'd try to find the English one. I couldn't find one, so I ordered it here. Anyways, there IS an all-Spanish version of this dvd out there if you prefer.

So far, I've watched White Fang all the way through. The other two films, I just skimmed through. This review will be more of a review of the White Fang movie included on this dvd.

I really enjoyed White Fang. I've never read the novel so I can't give you any details on how decent the book adaptation is. The original books are usually better than the movies 99% of the time and I'm sure that this is the case here. This movie is *not* steller, academy award winning material, but it's just a decent little film, especially for a cheap-o kiddie dvd like this; please keep that in mind when you're watching the movie. I would say that it's unfair to compare it to something like Balto or the Lion King, but for something like this, it's not bad. If you really love movies like Balto and its sequels, then you'll probably like this film. If you have a child or know a child who really likes wolves and dogs, then they might like this dvd. It's a good little movie if you need a cartoon wolf fix.

The animation for White Fang is just decent. It's not gorgeous, but it's not horrible. The character designs for the wolves and dog characters are cute.

There are no annoying characters (IMO), except for one, but eventually, he gets what's comming to him. Voice acting is decent.

There are about three short songs in this approximately 45 minute film. They're not nearly as annoying as some of the other animated films I've seen. The songs are mostly just used as character development devices to explain characters' feelings or personality, so they actually serve a purpose instead of just being there to annoy the crap out of you. You could fast forward through them, but you'll miss important character developmens. The songs are short though, maybe something like two minutes a piece.

Now on to the other two films... Like I said, I haven't watched them all the way through; I just skimmed through them so far to see what they were like, so this isn't going to be a very accurate or fair review. When I did this, I wasn't impressed. They appear to be made by a different animation studio than the one that produced White Fang. It's either that, or they're just in a radicaly different style. The character designs and backgrounds are very stylized (not as much as some of this stuff you'd see on tv nowadays, where characters are mostly just nothing but geometric shapes with faces drawn on them). They just seemed like boring movies to me. (I'm not taking stabs at the original novels, just these two films.) They might not be once you get into them; this is just my first impression. I might watch them someday when I'm really bored, but I'm not in a hurry to do so because then I might end up being even more bored, lol.

Anyways, if you're a really big cartoon wolf fan, then pick this up so that you can watch White Fang. The other two movies seem like filler space.",1297209600,,3272,4.434276206322795
