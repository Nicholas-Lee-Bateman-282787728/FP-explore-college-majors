3925223,5,B002GSXKOW,"If you do not like these movies don't rate them poorly.  The quality of the dvd's is what you are rating, and these were shipped with no blemishes and ran perfectly. If you want to buy these movies anyway buying them like this is definitely worth it.",1295308800,4,250,4.319148936170213
3925224,4,B002GSXKOW,"WHAT! 2 stars!

I give this a 4 stars because the first two Austin Powers are my favorite movies of all time. Gold Member was funny 3/4 of the movie I'd say.

Don't rate this low just because Spies like us is in this.  The Austin Powers is all that matters.  I bought this for ten dollars at Target not believing my eyes because you can buy just Goldmember for 20.  The other ones probably more then ten also.

I got this right when I saw it.  Just pretend Spies like us isn't there.  You have to see the Austin Powers movies.  They are better than any comedy movie out today.  i've watched them all like five times and me and my friends watch them and use their catch phrases.",1289433600,,677,4.138461538461539
3925225,2,B002GSXKOW,"They should've put The Love Guru as the fourth film because it's a another zany Mike Myers character movie which fits better with this set and call it the Mike Myers Collection. Besides, Spies Like Us is already included in another set.

WB probably figures they can still make a profit off their less favorable movies (box office bombs)by including them in a ""4 for the price of one"" collection. International Spies Collection falls under the category of a great trilogy set with a fourth less stellar flick (see Chris Tucker, Ice Cube sets).  Some collection choices (Batman, Superman, Final Destination, Nightmare etc) are actually great because each movies in the series is collected and that's a major reason why we consumers take interest.",1285372800,,745,5.0
3925226,1,B002GSXKOW,"When I saw this package at the store the other day I almost jumped! I was like whoa!-- all 3 Austin Powers movies for one nice economical price!... But then I looked further and... well... much to my dismay, I noticed that the fourth movie in the package was ""Spies Like Us"", and decided to pass it up.

Not only is ""Spies Like Us"" one of the most mediocre movies in all movie history, but the bigger insult of all is that it is ALREADY included in ANOTHER four-movie package! What's the joke here distributors? Aren't you guys aware that Spies Like Us is mostly unfunny, has a few funny moments in the beginning but then steers toward a bunch of unrealistic redundant occurrences that seem to be geared toward doing nothing more than hyping Chevy Chase? Definitely not one of John Landis' shining moments was this one. (May be good mostly as a historical artifact of some sort.) Why would you think you should have the nerve to really think this movie should appear in two different collections?

On principal only, I would encourage anyone who gets tempted to buy this to pass in up until ""Spies Like Us"" is replaced with something else. Although one can argue that it still may be worth the cost for the 3 Austin Powers films, I can only argue that principal is worth more than saving money! Sure we can ignore little slip-ups like this, but these little things turn into bigger things later...

Again, I encourage:-- DO NOT BUY THIS PACKAGE UNTIL ""SPIES LIKE US"" IS REPLACED WITH ANOTHER MOVIE! ""So I Married an Axe Murderer"" anyone?",1282176000,2,1537,4.561594202898551

I mainly bought this for the Austin Powers films since i have never owned them, but seen them on cable TV in the past many times. The only bad thing about this is Austin Powers the International Man of Mystery,and Spies like US are in full screen. I know these films were both shot in widescreen format so they should be presented that way on this DVD. For the price though i cannot complain too much. Great films that you will more than likely watch over and over.",1439683200,,536,4.264705882352941

There are some great perks to buying this pack and also some downsides

___ PROS ___

+ You get all 3 Austin Power's movies for a few $'s cheaper than having to buy them all separately on DVD + you get a 4th movie free of charge basically
+ Each movie looks fantastic on DVD especially when up-scaled to 1080p
+ Each movie has bonus features included and a disk menu (bundle packs often give you just the movie and not the extra goodies)
+ Its Austin Powers!!!!

Austin Powers Movie Ratings
International Man of Mystery: 4.8 / 5
The Spy Who Shagged Me: 4.5 / 5
Goldmember: 4.0 / 5 (weakest of the movies I think)

___ CONS ___

- You get all the movies on 2 DVDs  that means  DOUBLE SIDED disks!  I can't stand these.  While these are actually very high quality double sided disks (some tend to be thin and fragile), the writing to tell you what is on each side of the disk is microscopic pretty  much (a saving point is the back of the box does break it down for you in bigger print)
- Spies Like us.... don't get me wrong.  I love Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase  but the movie isn't all that good.  Another flick by Mike Myers would of been great or perhaps like a 2hr Best of Mike Myers special from SNL or something.  (odds are publishing rights came into contest here)

that's about all the negatives which isn't much.  You are getting a fantastic deal here, All the Austin Power's flicks + a bonus movie and they come with everything that the standard DVD's came with all in a neat small package.  I highly recommend this bundle pack and give it 5 stars.  Despite a few flaws they in no way influence the real reason why anyone buys this bundle pack..
