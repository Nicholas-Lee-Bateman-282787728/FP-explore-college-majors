4215809,5,B003X3QD52,"This is a great video for many levels of bowlers.  Beginning bowlers will get great tips on how to improve their fundamentals, while intermediate bowlers will learn essential information for taking their game to the next level.  I bought this video because I was looking for drills to use during practice, and there are plenty here to help me improve my consistency and shot-making.  The price of this video is less than you would pay a professional for a lesson, and you can refer back to it again and again when you game needs a tweak.  Diandra Asbaty is a great coach and has the experience to help bowlers of all skill levels.",1343692800,16,630,4.548672566371682

8407789,1,B003X3QD52,"I'm a beginner to intermediate bowler and really needed some tips and instruction on basic things like where to stand in the approach, how to hold the ball, how to release, my body form in the approach, how to hit the ""pocket"" etc., and after watching this video, I learned nothing. I believe if you were an advanced bowler you could follow along but it's not for beginners. Her section on spares was equally bad as the beginning going too fast to really flow along. I really feel like I wasted $25 on this video that didn't teach me anything.",1436745600,5,543,4.44

8407791,5,B003X3QD52,"I am new to bowling as this is my 2nd season in league bowling & I love it. I have  a lot of people in my ear helping me out but at times is overwhelming with a ton of info. I ordered her dvd watched it several times & applied her lessons & saw a great improvement in my game. For new bowlers this is a great tool to help you out & bowlers with some experience can benefit also learning key fundamentals. I have helped my wife with her game & our 5 boys as well who bowl in a youth league. I really like how she makes it easy to understand & follow, she has a lot of medals, awards, & is a silver level coach. With the dvd being 30 minutes is perfect, its not too long & it holds my sons attention. I am very pleased with my purchase",1427414400,2,733,3.7908496732026142

8407795,3,B003X3QD52,"This was good but not enough support with basic information for a beginner.  Needed more showing of how to hold, throw the ball from various positions to see what is required to be able to bowl.",1400457600,,194,4.388888888888889
8407796,3,B003X3QD52,There was good tips on this DVD but mostly for beginners. Also the video is way too short. Only a 30 min. video. Pass.,1375574400,,118,3.9583333333333335
