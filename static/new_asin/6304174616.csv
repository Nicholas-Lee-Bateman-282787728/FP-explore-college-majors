Earth is under attack by evil aliens in the future and the only hope is to refit the old World War II battleship, the Yamato.  It becomes the Argo and watch it begin its quest.  Most men 20-30 will probably remember this show from our childhood. END",873244800,4,405,4.36

7866142,4,6304174616,"I think I was 11 or 12 when this series was on the old UHF channels.  Every day after school I would watch the journey of the Argo to Iscandar.  I loved it!!  I had no idea they did a second and third series.  Where was I? Oh, yeah, Luke and Laura ran away together!  That's where I was.  But I'm so glad the series is on VHS.  Now I can relive a time when weekday afternoons were about visiting other worlds and not making deadlines!",1036972800,,434,3.9767441860465116

If you're like Tank Jr. and want to Protect your investments buy this movie today!!!!!!",1001808000,,248,4.880952380952381
7866144,5,6304174616,I love this tape!!! It has the best animation ever!!! In the other tapes the animations great but with a tallent like Akira Toryomo on board i thought the animation in the series was laging. But this tape starts a new wave of animation and even some cooler ships the Yamamoto must face in combat. This is the second season and the battle with ever growing Comit Empire is intensifying and now captain Global must make a disecion that will decide the fate of the Yamamoto and its crew.,982108800,,484,4.449438202247191
7866145,5,6304174616,I remember rushing home from school to watch this when it was on a UHF station and cable was for the rich.  School got out at 2:50 and Starblazers was on at 3:00.  I never missed an episode.  Now I can relive those days and share them with my kids.  These shows are a great story of man's  undying need to survive.  I'm so glad to see them again.,957225600,7,346,3.9420289855072466
7866146,5,6304174616,"First if you are a fan of any type of genre Star Blazers is the one for you. It offers suspense, tragedy, drama, action, you name it, it has it. Hailed by all critics as the best sci-fi cartoon of all time. You will  never again see anything that comes to the quality of Star Blazers. It  blows away evry movie and t.v. series away in any type of aspect. This  blows away any oscar winner by a long-shot. And now about the series. Its  about a race called the Gamilons sending radition bombs to earth. This  causes humans to live underground due to extreme radiation. The earths only  hope is a special ship design implamented on to the last remaining ship on  Earth The Yamato. Can this ship reach a planet light years away and save  their planet from destructio. Found out in the ongoing saga of Star  Blazers.",956620800,3,812,4.36

7866148,5,6304174616,"When I was 6 years old living in San Jose, California.  I used to wake up early every Saturday morning and watch Star Blazers.  This first set of episodes are classic since it introduces us and the world to possible  conditions in living underground cause of radiation.  But this radiation is  coming from a Bad guy(deslock) from another solar system.  A group of  people are set on course to destroy the planet that is sending radiation  meteors to Earth.  Along the way they encounter many obsticles, visit  different planets, and get to use the most powerful weapon of any  cartoon,""The Wave motion gun"".  Awesome series and great effects.  Lots of action and adventure.  They should make a video game out of this.  You haven't lived yet until you've seen this series.  Get it now, I've been  searching for this series for the last 10 to 15 years.  Thank you  amazon.com for giving me another chance to watch this series.  You need to  get the second series also, to finish the whole adventure.",919209600,3,997,4.680232558139535
