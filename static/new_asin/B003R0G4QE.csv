First, the voice over for the entire series is very drab and can even be desrcibed as nerve jarring.  Second, the man cannot even pronounce half of the names correctly; nor does he ever develop any rhythm...  It's not that this documentary gets too many facts wrong, it's that the production value is haphazard and lackadaisical.  I recommend turning of the sound and relying on Closed Captioning if you must view.",1307232000,7,506,4.781609195402299
8402753,2,B003R0G4QE,"The narration is laughable. Although the guy has an American accent, he not only mispronounces names and places, he even mangles English words, especially those that are specific to war. There are so many errors, and since I'm running on the treadmill while watching this, I can't write them all down. Some particularly memorable ones are the two ways he pronounces General Guderian's name, two times each within minutes of each other (""Goo'-der-in"" and ""Goo-dare'-ee-in""). And in the episode on the invasion of the Soviet Union, he calls the commander of Army Group North (twice) ""General Ritter"" (should be Ritter von Leeb). Similarly the commander of Army Group Center is labeled ""General Fedor"" (s/b ""Fedor von Bock"").

Give it two stars for the video.",1522195200,,756,5.096774193548387

8402755,3,B003R0G4QE,"While as a whole the video is passable, the use of stock footage in the wrong timeline just to highlight the narration makes the production slightly better than the History Channel.  The real flaw here is the narration.  The delivery is staccato with mispronounced names and places and laughable accents on wrong syllables.",1496620800,,323,5.0754716981132075

8402758,5,B003R0G4QE,"I bought this DVD set to replace a DVD purchased elsewhere that was damaged during the ""Stalingrad"" episode. I enjoy a variety of historical sources about past lives and events. This wasn't the best, but it did provide good timeline events and the people and occasions that called for a specific person's deed that warranted their names and images being talked of.",1446249600,,364,4.887096774193548

8402760,3,B003R0G4QE,"Get someone who speaks English as their first language, and has some idea what actually happened in WWII.  That narrator wasn't either.  The Video was good though.  There were a lot of clips I had never seen before.",1370995200,2,215,4.605263157894737
8402761,2,B003R0G4QE,"If you take the point of view this is entertainment, then the footage is great.  If you want correct history, this is poor at best.  For example, in the segment on the invasion of Poland, obvious errors are: showing the PzKwIV with the KwK L46 gun which didn't make its appearance until 1942, several segments which are obviously Ukraine are shown as Poland; mispronouncing most German generals names; showing Frech troops and calling them Polish, saying Guderian applied JFC Fuller & Basil Liddell-Hart's (BLH) theories and developed blitzkrieg.  First, Guderian never heard of BLH until after the war when BLH interviewed him in a holding pen, among many, many, other errors in this segment.  After the Poland segment, showing Erwin Rommel meeting Hitler which never happened until he achieved success in the desert - again 1942.  Showing Erich von Manstein in a field marshall's uniform as part of the planning team for the French 1940 invasion.  Manstein became Field Marshall in 1942 after the capture of Sevastopol in the Crimea.  In the segment on the fall of France, saying Guderian led 50 panzer divisions through the Ardennes Forest.  The real number is around 8.  Again showing a PzKwIV with the wrong gun which is east front footage.  The funniest one is showing the back end of a T34/76 (a Russian tank) and talking about the German breakout to the English Channel.

It is like no one knew or vetted the film for basic history, military equipment, or the sequence of the war at this company.  So as history it is fraught with errors.  As entertainment, the footage is very nice and it's fun to find all the footage and textural mistakes.

Like above, rarely seen footage makes this a 3 1/2-star event.  The manifold errors drove me to distraction - subtract 2 stars.",1345420800,8,1779,4.8250825082508255
8402762,3,B003R0G4QE,"I agree with Jeffrey Turner's review... the basic facts are correct on this DVD, but the narrator for ""The Dawn of War"" is simply terrible.  I know that's a harsh statement, but unfortunately, it's a valid one.  For example with ""The Battle of Britain"" segment of the 11-part series on this DVD, the narrator continuously refers to it as ""The Battle of England.""  Often his pronunciations are wrong, and somewhat comically so, as he changes the pronunciations of the same word throughout a given segment.  And, as Mr. Turner observed, his narration is boring, in a very monotone-type delivery sort of way.

The historical film available on this DVD is worth the price, and more.  Again, I agree with Mr. Turner's review... turn off the audio, and use the closed captions.

For WWII history buffs, this DVD is worth it.  I've never seen some of the archival film, and I've been viewing WWII battle films for over 40 years.  It's obvious that the narrator is young, and never heard of some of the locations, or war equipment used, before.  He's simply reading a poorly written script.

I give it 3 stars based upon the historical information provided, but deducted the 2 stars due to the poor narration.",1339459200,4,1201,4.753623188405797
