This dark chapter in Israeli history and so many other tragedies perpetrated by the WHITE, ANGLO, SECULAR POLITICAL elite upon North African and Mizrahi Jews is  fabric from which the current political and social climate in Israel today is cut from.

Very little has changed in 50 years. Sephardic children are not being zapped with atom bomb-like radiation by the likes of Chaim Sheba (G-d avenge his blood), but 1 in 6 Sephardic children in Israel goes hungry and  Unemployment among Sephardic men is more than 50%. Sephardic families earn 40% less that Ashkenazim. Sephardic men are 6 times more likely than Ashkenazim to die during army service and Sephardic children miss substantial amounts of each school year because their teachers are not paid.

It hurts to write this and the Ringworm Children is a movie that it hurts to watch. But it is a story that must be told and it is a must see!!",1168473600,10,1054,4.711956521739131
