757514,4,6304019688,"Given that censors can affect what finally makes it onto celluloid I am amazed this film ever made it into the public domain. okay, some may say its tame compared to other stuff but I haven't seen the other stuff! This film pretty much manages to capture the erotiscm of the book and when it works less well it tends to be in this places where the book falls over as well! Some scenes from the book have been cut I think but not to the detriment of the film. I expected this one to be a dog but it's not. If you like your erotica leather-edged you'll enjoy this one...",1018569600,12,568,4.126126126126126
757515,4,6304019688,"One of the few films that seriously explores the joys of watching one's wife/lover making love to another man. ""O"" loses herself in the depths of sexual surrender, thus finding herself in the process. She discovers total submission, not just to one man, but to many. Eventually she finds that she loves being taken at will by whomever chooses her. Her lover discovers the ultimate generosity of holding her hand as she is taken by her new master.
Much more than just an adult movie, this film beautfully explores the depths of human sexuality and the unique joys of dominance and submission.",1017446400,18,591,4.803921568627451
757516,5,6304019688,"The adaptation of this book to the screen back in 1975 was ""MAGNIFIQUE"". The dominace and submissive roles of all the actors in this movie were done with such discipline, that I just have to believe that the main charactor is one of submissive nature.
In being submissive, you are saying ""I love you"" without restictions. I remember viewing the movie: The Lover, and thought that Ms March, was actually having sex with her Lover. Im that convince that at the time this movie was made that Corinne, was deffiantely a submissive woman.
I have viewed this movie several time, and think that it has a place for most people's library. Its that good, and convincing. Being a submissive person, doesnt make you a weak person. In fact it takes a strong willed individual to be submissive to another, when LOVE is involved.
The lessons in this movie are too many to talk about here. I loved this movie for what it is. It shows that eroticism though submissivess is good and not bad.
Oh yes, did I mention that Corrine has a great body. :)",1009065600,4,1029,4.537634408602151
757517,5,6304019688,"I was prompted to write this review after seeing some of the tripe written about the film. Most so-called adult films are mindless, empty, clinical depictions of rutting and most ""erotica"" is childish and bland. The Story of O is different: it is literature and the film is an excellent adaptation of the novel. I read the novel first and felt nothing but satisfation on viewing the film. The director and cast bring the novel alive as it is meant to be.
This story, written by a woman I might add, is not about the exploitation of women or a woman. It is not about submission to anything other than one's own love and sexuality. It is symbolic, so profoundly so, that it must touch upon our archetypes.
Many might miss that through submission, O conquers her lover--totally. There is an irony here in that her lover ends up the submissive one. She taps into the infinite power of her femininity and becomes a goddess. I am not into bondage and discipline personally, yet this movie is a favorite of my wife and me. O haunts, she is supernally erotic, and profoundly feminine.
The quality of the film is first class, it is well acted, and is a classic. IMO, it is a must have film. It is the only erotic film in our house--the rest just are so bland.",989971200,481,1250,4.439130434782609
757518,4,6304019688,"Certainly this is a very erotic film based upon a very erotic book.  I am afraid that people take this material seriously and seeing it ""acted out"" in this movie may be a bad thing in that respect.  In general, I  have read interviews with the book's author and she said that it wasn't  meant to be literally interpreted.  The things done were more symbolic, the  enslavement emotionally, etc., rather than literally doing the things the  book describes.  Very likely if you did what was done to O to a real woman,  she would die.  Certainly be hospitalized at the least.  I mean branding,  sex with animals, bull whipping, etc.  Come on!  Good to read Anne Rice's  ""Beauty"" books as well, but better not to try this ""at  home""...",962668800,81,730,4.542635658914729

Probably not - masculine pride would prevent me from submitting, even if it brought sexual pleasure.

The author claims that O has achieved a position of power over her lover by arousing and maintaining his desire for her.

758430,4,6304019688,"O, played by the gorgeously seductive Corinne Clery, is taken to an isolated chateau by her lover, Rene, where she spends several weeks naked, training to be a sex slave for an elite club of wealthy men. Although she voluntarily agreed to the training and is free to leave anytime she wants, O is defiant and, as a result, is whipped nightly as punishment. After completing her training, she joins seven other ""slaves"" who must submit to the sexual whims of any member of the club, at anytime, anywhere. She wears a ring and necklace, which identify her as one of the club's slaves. O originally ""belongs"" to Rene, but he quickly gives her to his older brother, Sir Stephen, who at first treats O as property, not thinking twice about humiliating her in front of other club members, but they eventually fall in love, Sir Stephen convinces O to prove her love for him by submitting to additional training, which involves more simulated whipping, piercings and brandings, after which they live happily everafter.

O is naked as often as she is clothed. There is as much sex as there is whipping. Both are simulated, but stimulating. Strangely, the men are fully clothed in all the sex scenes, except one. Apparently men in France in the 1970's didn't bother disrobing to have sex. All the women in the movie are beautiful and sexy; most of the men are middle-aged. Every scene is well lit and there is no blood. For optimal viewing, I recommend watching the sex scenes in French since the English dubbed version doesn't capture the true emotions of the actors.

The movie never explains why O, an educated, successful fashion photographer, would submit herself to such treatment other than to say she loves Rene and loves Sir Stephen. It also fails to adequately explain what she gets in return for allowing herself to be raped, tortured and humiliated at will. The moral of the movie seems to be women need to be subservient to men if they want to find true happiness.

758603,2,6304019688,"<strong>The Story of O</strong> (Just Jaeckin, 1975)

French softcore director Just Jaeckin made his name--and made history--with the most successful softcore film of all time, 1974's <em>Emmanuelle</em>, which launched a massive franchise, brought some small semblance of artistry to softcore filmmaking, and in many ways legitimized the genre. In other words, Jaeckin could probably have retired after that one film and left the world an enduring legacy. But some folks just can't leave well enough alone, and so Jeckin set out, with all the hubris in the world, to make the definitive softcore version of what is, quite possibly, the most famous erotic novel of all time, <em>Histoire d'O</em>. Published in 1954 by ""Pauline Reage"" (a pen name, we have since learned, for feisty French intellectual Dominique Aury), the novel ignited controversy well beyond its rather modest artistry, and in the decades between book and adaptation, it sold in vast quantities. How could this possibly go wrong, when pretty much everyone who's going to be going to see your movie has already read the book, and when, let's face it, it's impossible to make a softcore version of the material anyway? The outcome of this should be obvious; whom the gods would destroy, they first fill with hubris.

Plot: a woman known only as O (<em>Moonraker</em>'s Corinne Clery) is dating Rene (<em>Suspiria</em>'s Udo Kier). As we open, they're in a car, being driven to a country mansion. We soon find it is a school of sorts, where women are taught submission through long session of S&M and an inability to say no to any of the school's masters who would have them. After she is well-trained enough, Rene reclaims her and, seemingly on a whim, hands her over to his half-brother, Sir Stephen (<em>The Wooden Horse</em>'s Anthony Steel), ay which point, not surprising to anyone but Rene, a love triangle develops. Ain't life grand.

The movie fails on just about every count; the sex is un-sexy, the S&M is so badly-filmed that, as has been pointed out in almost every review, O spends hours being flogged and yet never has a mark on her, and the action stops every few minutes for what are, essentially, lectures to the audience on Sadean philosophy. I'm sure someone, somewhere, knows of a reason to watch this movie, but I can't come up with one other than that Clery and Kier were both destined for much bigger things. * ",1307664000,,2401,4.920987654320988

This looks like a direct transfer from the DVD to Blu-ray, rather than a new scan of the negative direct to high def Blu-ray. In addition, there are several scenes that are from the French version, with what appear to be new, high def white subtitles. These scenes MAY by new scans in high def from the negative, but I'm not sure. There may even be one of two of these scenes that did not appear in the original English version.
The audio is generally OK (if low def and mono) except that there are several points lasting a few seconds each where there is a loud humming sound (although the dialog is still understandable).
As for content, those who like this kind of thing will like this movie. Done with relatively high production values and with narrative and reasonably believable acting. Soft core but lots of full frontal female nudity.",1307232000,3,911,4.527272727272727

I liked and disliked the movie.  I appreciate the movie for breaking boundaries in film.  However, I feel like the movie was missing a lot, which makes me want to read the book to see if that is the case.  I want to know why Rene is worthy of O's submission, most of all.  I want a deeper understanding of Jacqueline's submission to O.  The relation between O and Sir Stephen made me sense to me.  It's just that the way the movie goes,  it feels like it's about sex trafficking, rather than BDSM.  I want a deeper understanding of O's relationship with the slaves of Roissy.

The movie would have perhaps been better if it was a two parter, instead of going from scene to scene.  It is difficult to find the humanity in each character.  I think the only time O is seen outside of the men's realm of control is when she is at work, which I suppose conveys how independent she is otherwise, but does not add enough dimension.

758736,5,6304019688,This is a very stylized film of one woman's quest to gain freedom in a world where such eclectic desires are often kept to one's self. It is actually tame or yet highly erotic depending on your point of view. I saw it many years ago but was very impressed with Udo Kier's performance. He's rather enigmatic in his quest for that special kink he desires. Corinne Clery fits the role of O quite visually with her sense of innocence or is it really innocence?

I took away 1 star because there are dirt spots that shows up here & there through out the film. It appears that Somerville House did not have the original master print to transcribe the film to blue ray to completely remove all the imperfections in the film. Also the film was shot in soft focus so there is only so much room for upgrade in image quality.

This was a time when there was such a thing as an erotic film, that was very very different from porn films. This is a real movie, with lighting, angles and a storyline. It is not just a mindless flesh fest. The main actress Corinne Clery is very beautiful and there alot of other beautiful woman throughtout the whole picture, practically all being seen in the nude. Although sadommasochism isn't my thing, the film still was entertaining to watch. I feel however, that the submissiveness of O, the main character, is not believable for this day and age.

758806,5,6304019688,"Cinema's original sin returns with its shocking portrait of sexual submission from master of erotica Just Jaeckin (Emmanuelle, Lady Chatterley's Lover). Written by Anne Desclos (aka Pauline Reage, Dominique Aury) in 1954. A stunning young woman (Corinne Clery) surrenders herself at a remote chateau at her lover's request and is immediately forced into a round the clock regimen of every sexual appetite imaginable. Her submission is total to the orgasmic odyssey that explores the shadowy boundaries between pleasure and pain. The test is severe - sexual in method, psychological in substance. The most revealing scene is when a young man comes to call on her and sees first hand the whipping, flogging and caning she endures at the hands of her Masters sadistic maid.
In the creation of the movie, a delicate balance had to be maintained between making a beautiful romantic and erotic movie, which it is, and simply a pornographic movie which it is not. Certain scenes had to be removed because they dealt with issues that were to extreme for the public to understand or accept, and also to pass censorship.
This is a must see movie for anyone in the BDSM community. The artistic interest here has precisely to do with the use not only of erotic materials but also erotic methods, the deliberate stimulation of the viewer as a part of and means to a total, authentic movie experience.

758890,5,6304019688,"I have not yet read the originating novel, but I have just finished watching this movie for the second time.  I was renting it.  Now I'm going to buy it - one of very few, as I almost never buy movies.

I must say that I found much more in it the second time.  The first time not only did the physical and emotional whippings disturb me but, just as much, O's willing apparent debasement and her masters' disregard for her feelings - they only seemed to care about her obedience.  This is an anti-turnon for me.  The sex scenes are not really convincing, nor are the whippings.  I realized that I, as audience, was not being asked to accept that much pain or that much pleasure from either.

The male characters are much more flat than the female ones, particularly O, as if they really didn't count.  And there was something in this most beautiful woman's portrayal which left me thinking it wasn't at all simple.

Bottom line, it is abundantly clear that this is far, far more than an S&M movie, nor is it about bondage, submission and domination, or any other kind of sexual perversion or obsession.

Some phrases stuck out to me, although I'm not sure I'm quoting exactly accurately.  The narrator said the O loved everything and everyone that came to her because it came to her by request from her lover.  She said that O knew that if she lasted to the end that all would be given to her.  O's apparent peace of mind about everything that happened to her simply didn't gybe with a debasement/submissive/sexual perversion sort of story.  She definitely does not come across as sick.  She, at times, was as deeply terrified or ashamed as any normal woman would be in the circumstances and yet continued freely to accept the demands of obedience to those who loved her and those who didn't.  I was puzzled at how easily she accepted that Rene was no longer her lover, and continued to do exactly the same thing with Sir Stefan.  All of this indicated that something much deeper than anything relatively superficial about perversion, infatuation, and so-on was going on.  It made far too deep an impression the first time I saw the movie, even without understanding it.  It made me think that it was, as another reviewer mentioned, hitting some archetypes, and something deep in the human spirit.

I began to think of the whole story as an extended metaphor about the demands and rewards of love.  When we love, we willingly go through hell for the sake of love -- not just for the sake of the lover.  The love relationship places heavy demands of obedience on us.  It whips us and debases us -- love and its intimacy always find our weaknesses, and their exposure makes us feel naked, beaten and debased. But love always allows us the freedom to opt out, as did O's lovers and masters.  And something deep within us always knows that, if we succumb to the abasement we may feel, and accept the beating our feelings take, that love, real human love, marks us forever as O was marked, and enbles us to love and be loved fully and deeply, and gives us peace -- indeed, it grants us everything.  O shows us how wonderful it can become if we are not overly defensive about our selves in the service of love.

The movie itself does not look as dated as you would think for a 1974 movie -- actually, not at all.  The color is a little unsaturated compared to the kind of color we have today, and this contributes to the fantasy that is clearly being spun.  I happen to enjoy naked women a lot, and there are a lot of them in this movie, fully frontal, more than a glimpse, naked and unashamed.  There are few scenes that are fully clothed for very long.  I thought all were beautiful women, self-possessed, graceful, fully feminine and sensual without being affected.

The two brief closeup shots of ""female genitalia"", as one reviewer put it, (although he apparently didn't even notice them), are exquisitely done - just close enough, just long enough, just modest enough, just open enough.

There is a visual potpourri of modern day (for 1974), turn-of-the-century wealth and romanticism, and even some medieval castles and costumes.  The only thing that bothered me even temporarily was Sir Stefan's overly-coiffed hairdo, but it didn't take long to get past it.  It's a legitimate part of his character.

And the best comment of all came from my wife when the movie was over.  And I hasten to add that there are absolutely no submissive or dominative tendencies in her at all.  She said, ""Wierd. Wow. That's one very sexy movie"".",1171411200,19,4528,4.57196029776675

758893,4,6304019688,"Reage's O is the best-known of the SM novels, one of very few that has made it into the general awareness. This movie is a truncated version of the story, with some interesting differences.

A movie is a visual presentation, so many details have been added or filled in. In that respect, the movie carries indelible marks of its 1970s origin - bell-bottom side burns, wide ties, and Farrah Fawcett hair for some of the women. Bust implants were mostly unknown in the 70s, so the female figures are more natural and varied than in newer flicks, too. And, this movie comes from the time when ""safe sex"" meant not falling out of bed.

In an effort to approach main-stream audiences, many of the book's more repugnant elements have been dropped. Still, here's plenty of eroticism left in numerous synthesexual engagements. The movie's pervasive theme of control, submission, and pain is intact. It will turn many people off - it was never meant to appeal to everyone, and doesn't much appeal to me. The very last scene of the movie is a surprise, though. It's quite unlike the book, and somehow made everything else make a lot more sense.

Some of the scenes are very sexy, which is, after all, what you watch the film for.  Other scenes really aren't.  And some just drag.

It should not have turned into a love story at the end.  This story is about sex, and nothing but.  It should have stayed that way.  As a love story it is just weird.  It had me wondering what this couple would be like in their retirement years, and how they, as an elderly couple, would have felt about what they did in this movie.  They really should have kept love and real relationships out of it, because this is a sex fantasy, and sex fantasies simply don't mix well with reality.

To sum it up, it should have just been a series of sex fantasies, and no reality at all, because as a realistic movie it completely fails and doesn't interest you in the characters, but as a sex fantasy it has its moments.",1129593600,3,1042,4.103960396039604

758897,4,6304019688,"`The Story of O' directed by Just Jaeckin and `The Image' directed by Radley Metzger are both based on famous and critically well received French erotic novels written, I believe, in the 1960s by Pauline Reage (a pseudonym) and Jean de Berg respectively. In turn, the two movies are both considered masterpieces of erotic moviemaking. Yet the latter is clearly better than the former, in spite of the fact that the two books are, to my mind, roughly equal in quality. I may even believe that `The Story of O' is superior as a novel to de Berg's fiction.

While both are of a very high quality, they approach roughly the same subject in very different ways. In `The Story of  O', everything is seen and told through the eyes of the submissive, `O'. In `The Image', everything is seen through the eyes of the bystander become dominant, Jean. That does not mean that `O' can tell us nothing of the dominant psychology or `Image' tell us nothing of the submissive psychology. In fact, it is one of the strengths of `The Image' that it probably tells us more about true psychological submissiveness than the movie, `O'.

The primary problem with `The Story of O' film is that while its source is certainly a very well constructed fantasy, the director does not hide this fact and play it as reality. This may be comparable to our not taking the confrontation between Gandalf and the Balrog at the bridge in the mines of Moria (in `Lord of the Rings') because we know this is all a fantasy. The power of great fantasies is that they allow us to totally suspend disbelief for the course of the experience. In Jaeckin's commentary, he states over and over that this is all a fantasy and was intended as such by author, Reage. But, one of Reage's great skills was to minimize the improbable aspects of the story to sustain the sense that this plot is actually being played out by real people.

The second problem for me with `The Story of O' is the fact that it did not improve on my imagination while I was reading the book. Going back to that other fantasy, `Lord of the Rings', one of its great successes is the fact that at every turn, it improved on the constructs of my imagination. The black riders, the Uruk-hai, and Shelob were all far scarier than what I read, and the reading was pretty scary. At but one scene does the film outdo my imagination.

The third problem, which the movie shares with the book, is the improbability of a woman's so easily moving her affection from one dominant to the next. The book's original ending makes great use of the chasm this reliance on a master opens at the submissive's feet. The movie squanders the great original ending in a muddle of alternatives.

`The Image' easily sidesteps the last problem by being a very simple `menage a trois'. And, while the submissive is asked to perform with outsider, Jean, she is always devoted primarily to dominant Claire. As far as improving on my imagination, I will only say that from what you think you are seeing on the screen, director Metzger is pulling no punches and Mary Mendum playing the submissive is about as convincing as I can imagine in her role, in comparison to `O''s actress, Corinne Clery, who sometimes seems to be simply working through the boredom in some scenes.

Part of the reality of `The Image' is based on the immediacy of all the settings. Like some films by Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese, where New York City is almost as much a character in the movie as the actors on the screen, several locations in Paris are important contributors to the lush, overripe feel of the film. In contrast, `The Story of O' could have as easily been filmed in Quebec or Sidney, and no one would have noticed the difference.

On the other hand, while the two films are of roughly the same lengths, `The Image' spends a lot more time conveying the relationship by showing its fruits rather than by talking about it.

Both movies are easily 1000% better than any other movie on these subjects, but `The Image' is clearly the better of the two in a very small field.",1125619200,8,4053,4.548696844993141

My favorite part is when O gives her first whipping to another...and the becomes succumbed with such caring and in delight her receiver becomes calm and realizes that O meant her no harm. Obviously again, submissives and dominants are simply choosing a way of life...and in that life...one receives and one gives. I believe being a dominant takes a lot more work and thinking. I also believe that the dominant doesn't have all that much power. Unless they know themselves truly...and very few do.

The story is set in a fantasy world full of luxury, extravagance and beauty; where most of the women are the submissives and live to obey their male/female masters. It's the ultimate BDSM film.  I totaly recommend it;  but, be warned, it's a French film made in 1975!  It's one of the masterpieces of the Golden Age of Erotica.  Don't expect Hollywood!  This DVD edition has a multiple language feature (English, Spanish and the original French) but no subtitles, and a 20 minute comentary (in French) by the director.",1107043200,19,627,4.6454545454545455
758956,5,6304019688,"Lots of female nudity, whippings, soft core sex, more nudity, more whippings..what's not to love?

A genuinely sexy, thought provoking and nicely photographed adaptation. Its certainly not as unpleasant and misogynistic as some have described. Note that our heroine, O, fully consents to her numerous whippings and sexual encounters and always seems to be stronger and more assured of herself than any of the male characters. At least thats how I interpreted it.",1104364800,14,462,5.328767123287672
758957,5,6304019688,"The Story Of O to me is one of the most tasteful and erotic films addressing domination, bondage, and true surrender that I have ever had the privlidge to view. This film not only gave me insite into another lifestyle but also to another world. If you really think about it we are all dominated by something and this film captures the domination and submission of true love. In my opinion the true message of this film is total trust. I know from personal expierience that trust is the basis of all relationships including O's. O completely gave not only her trust but herself. Is this not what happens in a marriage? It may be comparing apples to oranges but when one marries do you not give yourself completely to your spouse? O herself gave body, mind, and soul without saying vows because it was an issue of totaly putting her trust in another and in the stregnth of their relationship. This movie awakend desires in myself and I am greatful for the veiwing pleasure as it has added great pleasure into my life. This is a true art film that can inpact your own life if you look for the deeper meaning and not what many people percieve as degrating and offensive. There truly is a fine line between pleasure and pain and as long as it it a mutual relationship pain can be pleasurable as O did realize. There are critics in every crowd and this movie will always cause controversy due to the nature and subject matter. If you have not already made up your mind on this type of subject matter The Story Of O is an exceptional look into the world domination and submission. This movie delves into and explains  aspects of submission while making sure total trust still remains as the heart of the movie.",1102550400,22,1703,4.47588424437299
758958,3,6304019688,I thought the beginning of the book really drew me in.  It started off very interesting and sexual.  As I continued to read I stayed interested in certain parts and other parts I was kind of just dragging through.  It is a very sexual book but done in a very tasteful manner.  There were times that I just could not believe what O was doing and why she allowed to be treated the way she was.  But towards the end you get a better understanding of it all.  I must admit by the end I was totally over the book.  I had enough of the whole man sexual power ego trip.  I would recommend the book but it would not be one of my top choices.  I was just kind of disappointed with the ending of the book.,1098316800,5,695,3.9782608695652173
758959,1,6304019688,"I read the reviews offered for this movie and thought hey I might like it. I enjoy some of the soft porn movies, but this one is way more than anything I have ever seen. I don't mean that as good.

First of all I don't know when this movie came out, but it looks like mid '60s. It has a grainy way about it. It isn't like the shadowing they use now, but close. The hair and clothes actually look like '70s so that is probably it.

I tend to want to give benefit of the doubt so I thought maybe it would get better after watching it for about 1/2 hour. This thing is more than 1 1/2 hours long. It didn't, if anything it got worse. The acting in this movie makes porn stars seem intelligent. It is mainly about sadomasticism. That is what I felt like I was being put through watching this thing. The main character is a naive woman who is ""owned"" by a man who puts her into some cult where men can do whatever they want to the women staying there including beating them with a whip whenever they want to. The nudity was actually plain annoying. There was nothing in this movie to get excited about or make you want to go reinact any of the scenes. Thats just the first hour of the movie. She then goes to belonging to this first guys brother, which doesn't make sense either, so that means she is owned by 2 men. Basically the whole movie is about torture and sex. Believe me it was a torture for me too.

This movie is just plain awful - I had to give it a score of 1 star because of the way this review thing goes, but 1 star is really pushing it. I suppose if you are into SM then you will enjoy this ""movie"". Oh, by the way the lady's name in the movie is O. Please do not even bother to rent this let alone buy it it would be a complete waste of money.",1097366400,16,1756,3.9688385269121813
758960,2,6304019688,"Had I never read the book, I am sure I would have enjoyed this movie. But the truth is the movie does nothing but show some nice quiet people being nice and quiet. Yes, I say nice. I felt no desperation, violence, love, extremes of the heart that should have been portrayed constantly. I felt very let down. The masters did not display much domination, physically or psychologically. O seemed bored, not attentive or aggressive enough for one who is bound. Two stars for the pretty people. I'd call it a very nice horse movie, National Velvet anyone?",1096416000,6,550,4.622448979591836

It kinda misses the mark in all areas, except for the fact that if you can get a girl to watc it with you she'll probably be up for some sweating later on -- due to the erotic nature of the film.  I'd like to contrast this with the ""New Sex Now"" video, which, while it is very low in production values, delivers a major payload in the content and expertise that it bestows upon lucky viewers.  O, I wish this ""O"" had been something near as good as the book ""Story of O"" which was PHENOMENAL -- but alas, it woulda been nice.",1075766400,6,598,4.008403361344538

I wish I'd been able to figure out what sort of self-discovery or personal voyage the main character was experiencing...  but this movie tells me nothing. Someone mentioned something about the good musical score of this movie... I like punk and rock music but the music in the movie just didn't cut it for me. Perhaps the sex scenes or some great acting could compensate for this boring movie but they didn't. A complete waste of time. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",1069459200,6,730,4.407407407407407

Unlike the series, this film gets straighter to the psychological points-not that erotica shouldn't linger! THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT LOVE-OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE A TRASHY, FABIO DECORATED ROMANCE NOVEL!! However the needless and confusing pasted on endings of both versions are bizarrely, ridiculously romantic, and bastardize the novel-whose tragic end lent some integrity to an otherwise painful plot.  However this specifi film has the silliest and most unbelievable ending of the both.  It just does not feel right-intellectually or emotionally.  I won't delve into its implied Freudian theories of a female pleasure linked inextricably and perhaps solely upon a natural female massochism-it is however, interestingly enough, proof of  ""Domestic Tranquility's"" hypothesis that woman subconsciously must choose between benign chivalrous dominance (traditional marriage) or Sir Stephan's Dungeon (malignant dominance).
This is where it becomes fascinating and more significant than fluffy posturings of ""love.""
Anyway, as a woman it's far more easy to watch than one might imagine!!  So have at it!",1064620800,6,1338,5.841025641025641
758965,4,6304019688,"Most of us, myself included, have no frame of reference for legitimate sexual servitude. One of the true minority expressions of attraction, affection, and admiration, voluntary surrender of this degree is an almost ineffable experience. Like Anne Rice's Beauty series, The Story of O gives some insight into this world. In the age of feminism, the idea of such surrender is anathema, but following the story to the end we see that O is as much the master as is Stephen. In her perfect obedience, she enslaves the man who knows he will never find such perfect submission and is enchanted.
The film is beautiful,as are the people. Taken as eye candy, it is worth the price, but is further and more complex.

The story gives ample opportunity for ""O"" to have casual [love] with many, many partners while still extolling flighty principles of devotion.  The fact that anyone would think this movie has principles is laughable.  But one has to admire the audacity of Mr. Jaeckin in thinking that people will view this as a masterpiece of modern art.  I am almost certain that most people who will purchase this film will do so out of self-gratitude rather than intellectual pursuits.  I guess some people will get their jollies any way they can.  As a side note, the commentary track by the director is actually pretty entertaining.  He has a lot of amusing (possibly unintentionally) insights into the film that makes the commentary track far more interesting than the film itself.
