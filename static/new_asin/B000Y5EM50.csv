8230960,3,B000Y5EM50,would you believe the one scene I was most interested in was omitted!,1492300800,,69,4.384615384615385
8230961,2,B000Y5EM50,"Im a big Stan and Ollie fan. This film sadly,I wish had never been made. Thelma Todd was cast at first as the gypsy queen but died while this film was being made,so,alas,shes only got a small part.
The boys are gypsies who get into all kinds of problems.
The original script(Sample,Stan gets drunk and turns the scene into a laugh riot)was not used. Sadly,Hal Roach used the alternate script which is nowheres as good.
I saw it years ago and was disappointed.",1325376000,,459,4.542168674698795
8230962,4,B000Y5EM50,Laurel and Hardy are so funny in this movie.  Hilarious scene when Laurel attempts to fill wine bottles!  Lots of singing!  Great fun!,1324771200,,134,4.739130434782608
8230963,3,B000Y5EM50,"FYI, for those whom it matters to, this disc is a DVD-R.  Sound and video quality are fine.  Just saying, because they're not (until after you've paid, when the product arrives with a label).  5 stars for the film, 1 star for the honesty, equals 3 stars in the rating.",1306195200,,268,4.32
8230964,4,B000Y5EM50,"loved this old old movie with Laurel and Hardy - however, wanted to know the name of the song (something like I dreamt???) so I could find and purchase said song...... not even mentioned in the credits",1286150400,2,201,4.45945945945946
8230965,5,B000Y5EM50,"Thelma Todd sings one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. Stan and Ollie play bumbling gypsy thieves. One exceptionally funny scene of Stan and Ollie robbing a nobleman, and a funny ending. Pleasant with quaint sets. A gypsy man sings an excellent opera song. Yet, the most outstanding part of the film is Thelma Todd's wonderful song. Darla Hood of the Little Rascals plays the young princess. Thelma Todd also sings a nice song in Laurel and Hardy's film ""The Devil's Brother"", also known as ""Fra Diavolo"" or ""Bogus Bandits"".

I recommend Laurel and Hardy's best talking films under the comment-button below.",1240963200,2,621,4.914285714285715
8230966,5,B000Y5EM50,"This is one of the early films of Laurel and Hardy,but one of their best. The bottling of wine by Laurel is a classic. The movie, for as old as it is, transfered well to DVD.",1233705600,,174,3.861111111111111
8230967,5,B000Y5EM50,"Laurel & Hardy fans can be divisive about the quality of films these two clowns appear in, and ""Bohemian Girl"" hasn't always been on the top of their list. But it is pure joy, partly because it reflects a naive Hollywood effort to bring some (operatic) ""culture"" to movie house audiences, but mostly because these two guys could mug their way through ""Carmen"" and steal the show. Their Gypsy garb and gab and above all Oliver's facial repertoire here reinforce their classic stature as Best of Comics. This film has four inimitable routines: Stan's solo wine bottling episode, the pair's pickpocketing fiasco,a slight of hand contest and Stan burrowing under Ollie's mattress to steal some coins. A durable old Balfe operetta turned into buffa, ""The Bohemian Girl"" is one of three brilliant Laurel&Hardy musical  adaptations, including ""Fra Diavolo"" and ""Babes in Toyland."" Alas, they never got around to improving Wagner's operas. Great loss.",1229817600,3,943,5.163398692810458
8230968,2,B000Y5EM50,"Though ""Swiss Miss"" was among Laurel and Hardy's lesser features, it contained several vintage sequences. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about ""The Bohemian Girl"" (1936)  a dour comic opera with few highlights. What worked so beautifully in ""Fra Diavolo"" falls flat this time around. The Stan and Ollie characters remain submerged in the operetta's unrelenting heaviness. After her mysterious death, Thelma Todd's final screen role was severely truncated in post-production, which didn't help matters.",1227139200,,509,5.786666666666667
