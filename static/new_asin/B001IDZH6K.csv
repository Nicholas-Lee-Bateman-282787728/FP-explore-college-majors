8310834,4,B001IDZH6K,"Gary Albright was just so freakishly athletic and awesomely powerful, it defies description. No way should a man of his size and build have been able to move the way he did. He was Brock Lesnar before there was Brock Lesnar, but even more so.
I loved the commentary-free footage, but on the downside the editing of this set was beyond awful. Many times you can hear the crowd reacting to action going on in the ring, but you don't get to see it because full-screen replays are being shown of often-inconsequential strikes and rope escapes. Detracts from the footage in a huge way and makes me wish I'd kept my old VHS tapes of UWFi action where they didn't botch the edit.
However, even badly-cut footage of the massively-underappreciated monster that was Gary Albright is still worth watching.",1494806400,,794,4.719424460431655
