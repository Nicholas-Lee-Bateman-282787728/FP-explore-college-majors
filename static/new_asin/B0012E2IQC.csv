8245329,4,B0012E2IQC,"This documentary, on real life baller Rayful Edmond is a good look into his life and story. The man who has been profiled in all the street magazines- Don Diva, As Is and F.E.D.S and on 60 Minutes was a monumental figure in his hometown of Washington DC. He took the drug game to new heights but then tarnished his legacy by turning snitch. Still he is a hip-hop and street legend that people still talk about in the streets in in the underbelly of our nations prison where the stories of his grandiosity are still recounted. Check this out, not the best dvd production wise but it tells an intriguing and interesting story if you are into the tales and lore of the black urban gangsters.",1335398400,,688,4.425196850393701

8245331,5,B0012E2IQC,"I am from the Washington area, so I knew about Rayful Edmonds. But I didn't know what I thought I knew. This documentary was very informative. Such a powerful man. I often wonder how he would have done if he had done somthing else legal. Such a mind, just gone to waste. Very nice looking young man with so much power. I got this dvd because we were having trouble with my granddaughter wanting to join a gang. I purchased both 1 & 2 documenteries on Rayful Edmonds and Stanley ""Tookie"" Williams. We are praying watching these will change her mine. With God's help I know it will. I refuse to lose her to the streets. Good job.",1208304000,8,627,4.322033898305085
8245332,5,B0012E2IQC,"This was a very interesting documentary, another great by street stars. I started watching this not knowing what to expect and found myself drawn to how Rayful continued to build his empire even after being locked up. The editing and music arrangement kept it very interesting...",1207526400,3,279,5.086956521739131
