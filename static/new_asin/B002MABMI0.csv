8476516,4,B002MABMI0,"Awesome movie. Had the old VHS version as a kid. Can't believe it was actually available. Great footage of Rory Russell and all the top pros from the 80's. Great footage of Pipe, Dane Kealoha  pig dogging. Especially enjoyed the footage from Uluwatu and Grajagan, no narration and the music is obviously dated, but the waves and the surfing trumps all that anyway!!",1469318400,,365,4.7936507936507935
