8625956,5,B00GP0IV96,"Excellent seller, Seller replaced the original move as when I received it it was missing both DVD's. Seller rushed me the DVD's and paid for the shipping to make the deal correct. Movie is informative and easy to watch. Movie lenght is plenty long and worth the money paid for the DVD.",1407542400,,285,4.5
8625957,5,B00GP0IV96,"When fish don't seem to be rising to the standard patterns I'll tie on a Snody Fly...and the fish don't reject it. I used Mike's Tan Sparkle Caddis in Utah's Single Fly Contest, and we took second place. They are a great fly that will last many fish, and it won't come unraveled. Thanks Mike!!

8625958,5,B00GP0IV96,"Mike, your new tying DVD's a real home run. The camera work closeups and tying sequences are outstanding and directions are clear.

Perfectionist that you are, Mike, the end product of each of your flies is always that you ""nailed it!""

These innovative patterns are exquisite and having used them, I know the trout agree!

The result of your personal observations and research astream, plus countless hours of stream testing and fastidious tying refinements, continues to result in amazing patterns.

Tyers and fisherman alike will really profit from these patterns and your tips on how to use them. Congratulations, again.
