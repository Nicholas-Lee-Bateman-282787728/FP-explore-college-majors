Really Really Really a one-must-have for everyone who wants to play the blues on piano...",1358208000,,220,5.470588235294118
8001651,5,B0000E0ZYF,"One of the best ways to enter the great New Orleans Piano heritage.  Mac could be a little more involved but that's the Dr.

It's not perfect but it's sure a great start towards NOLA piano playing.  I would have asked for a few different songs but who wouldn't?

Full recommendation because there is no real competition until Toussaint does one.",1336953600,2,345,4.60655737704918
8001652,5,B0000E0ZYF,"I wasn't sure what to expect with these dvd's. The sound is excellent, the video quality is too. This is hanging out with a New Orleans legend.  Dr John is an amazing musical talent. He does try to teach, but he isn't going to talk Maj7th chords or intervals. You have to watch his hands, over and over. You will learn. I bought these months ago not knowing how to play this style. Now I can imitate a great imitator.

More effort could have been put into the lame transcriptions included in mini booklet. I think it my have been a little early in the morning for the good Doctor. Also, a woman asking questions and mixing drinks my have been better than the stoned hippy mumbling half sentences.

 If you price this as two piano lessons it's a bargain. If you watch and listen to them 20+ times it's a great deal.",1161907200,13,814,4.300653594771242
8001653,3,B0000E0ZYF,"I was expecting more dissection of what Dr John was playing than what is contained on these DVDs. There is an vast abundance of material but very little breakdown of it. To tell the truth, I think the moderator was a little intimidated and didn't want to press the issue of having the good doctor slowdown and explain some of the clich' riffs he was playing. This would have been a huge benefit to aspiring hacks like myself wanting to learn some of the tricks of the trade. I feel I could of bought a few cds and been just as well off transcribing rather than purchasing this package. I suppose you could slow down the DVD and catch what he is doing. And, if you have the patience to do that you can probably gain a lot. But personally I would have rather been shown the breakdown of Dr John's riffs in a more instructional manner.",1106524800,26,832,4.305732484076433
