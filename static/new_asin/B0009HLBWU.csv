It's slow, bleak to say the least, I'd suspect rather telling of life under communism, unless you're one of the privileged with connections - and none of these folks are - and some of them only exacerbate the strife and struggle.",1215820800,,279,4.6938775510204085
8060793,4,B0009HLBWU,"Some movies come along and shock us with their realism. We often complain that events that happen in the movies cannot happen in real life. Everything ends too perfectly. The lovers always kiss and make up in the end. We sit and watch and say to ourselves ""yeah right""! Some filmmakers have went against the tide though. John Cassavetes comes to mind and his films ""Faces"" and ""A Woman Under the Influence"" but you need to add another name to that list, Hungarian filmmaker Bela Tarr.

 Bela Tarr's debut film is perhaps one of the all time great debut films. Tarr, for those who don't know his name, is one of the most uncompromising directors to come out of Eastern Europe. He shoots his films in black and white, takes long unbroken camera shots, his work is usually compared to Tarkovsky and Antonioni for this reason and his films slow pace. Some of his major films include ""Santantango"" and ""Damnation"".

 In ""Family Nest"" though none of his usual characteristics are present. Yes the film is shoot in black and white but the movie does not have the long uncompromising camera shots if anything the film resembles the work of Cassavetes who clearly inspired this film. And I think Cassavetes inspired his other film ""The Prefab People"".

 ""Family Nest"" has so many moments where I found myself able to relate to the characters onscreen that it is unlike any other film I have seen in recent times.

 The plot is not that complex. It is rather straight forward. Iren and Laci, a married couple with a daughter, are having problems after Laci returns home from the army. Iren and her daughter have been living with Laci's father, which already has too many people living in it.

 The couple wants to get their own place but soon Laci's father starts to question Iren about whether or not see has been faithful to his son.

 Tarr doesn't heistant to show these characters bad sides. He's not trying to make a ""pretty"" film. He's trying to show the hardships of family life and married life. Things are not always perfect. Sometimes people corrupt our minds when there was nothing there to corrupt, but, that's life.

 Even though this film doesn't resemble Tarr's later films, at least as far as style goes, it still ranks as one of his greatest films. All Bela Tarr fans should make an effort to see it.

 Bottom-line: One of Bela Tarr's best films. ""Family Nest"" is an uncompromising look at family and married life. The movies does not hold back but tries to present an accurate picture of a modern family and succeeds in showing us the movies are sometimes capable of displaying real people with real problems we, as an audience, can relate to.",1161129600,7,2651,4.656652360515022
