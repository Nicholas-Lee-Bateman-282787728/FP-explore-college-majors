8377584,5,B002Q9VPFC,OMGosh! This interactive Harry Potter game was the perfect gift for our grandchildren. They play it several times everyday. I just wish there were more Harry Potter interactive DVD games for purchase!,1520985600,,200,5.28125
8377585,5,B002Q9VPFC,A lot of DVD games like this that are interactive movies and cartoons don't play well on all DVD players and systems. Check the remote sensitivity too. Different DVD players and remotes respond differently on DVD games. If there's any issues check the compatibility of the DVD player with the game. My game had a couple slowing down issues and didn't respond perfectly with my DVD player but it worked perfect when I played it on my PS3 and PS4 system.,1515024000,,452,4.592592592592593
