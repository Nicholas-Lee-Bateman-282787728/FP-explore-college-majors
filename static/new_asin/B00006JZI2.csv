1783161,4,B00006JZI2,"Mickey's Twice Upon A Christmas is a follow-up to 1999's Once Upon a Christmas.  The big difference is that this time around is that it's been computer animated in 3D...that's quite a change to those of us used to seeing Mickey and the Gang in traditional 2D.  But I guess the success of Pixar has pushed this change.

There are five short features included, each running in the 6 - 18 minute range.

""Belles on Ice"" features Daisy and Minnie in a figure-skating duel.

in ""Christmas: Impossible"", Huey, Duey, and Luey mail themselves to the North Pole to guarantee they get presents for Christmas.

""Christmas Maximus"" features Goofy and his son Max, as max is worried about pops messing things up when he comes home from college with his girlfriend.  Max is in college AND has a girlfriend???? where have I been??

""Donalds Gift"" deals with Donald's frustration with the holiday season and hearing We Wish you a Merry Christmas over and over.

The last and best feature is Mickey's Dog-Gone Christmas"" Mickey punishes Pluto and send him out to his doghouse.  Pluto then Runs away to the North Pole and Mickey goes off in search of him.

All in all a pretty good DVD of Christmas fun.  The Animation certainly is not Pixar quality but it's decent but takes a bit of getting used to.",1099958400,7,1283,4.628318584070796
1783162,5,B00006JZI2,"It was especially delightful to see and hear Mickey Mouse and all

the characters getting ready for the Holiday Season.  The entire film is sure to put the audience in the Christmas spirit.  The animation was wonderful and proves computer animation can work for the Disney product. The colors were beautiful and the characters were charming.  The scenes were chock full of humor and action.  The humor was delightful...as well as the music which was lively and fun.  There were lots of colorful and fun-pack scenes which are bound to generate Christmas Spirit and at the same time moral of the stories hits home. Altogether this movie is a perfect Christmas film and is a must have for anyone's home collection of Disney movies.",1099872000,4,728,4.830645161290323
1783163,3,B00006JZI2,"Mickey returns to DVD with the sequel to the popular Once Upon a Christmas released two or three years ago. The difference? This is totally computer generated.
Disney's seeming wish to kill traditional 2D animation marches on with the trailer for this looking like a video game.
I'll reserve total judgment until I see the complete article but I can't help but feel sad that the oldest surviving cartoon character in Hollywood has been subjected to the march of progress. The sound you hear is Uncle Walt spinning in his grave.
----
Well, I've watched it! And it's not as bad as I'd thought it would be.
The characters are slightly constrained by the CGI animation and, in particular Goofy, have lost a little of the expressivness and freedom of facial expression that hand-drawn animation gives. The animation is not Pixar standard but is good enough to serve a strong script that features five yultide morality tales. I strongly object, however, to Scrooge McDuck saying ""there's more to life than money""!!!
A good effort but I hope that the Disney animators haven't thrown away their ink, paint and cels just yet.",1099353600,7,1116,4.848167539267016

1783221,1,B00006JZI2,"My four year old son got this as a gift and was very excited to watch it. The animation is well done, although Mickey and friends don't have their usual classic look. The stories all contain a message, but they just don't leave you feeling uplifted and happy like Christmas movies should. The last story with Mickey and Pluto made me especially sad and uncomfortable. Mickey Mouse, my son's hero, is terribly rude to his loveable companion in this story, prompting Pluto to run away. So, we have rivalry between Daisy and Minnie, bratty Huey, Duey, and Luey, crabby Donald (this was true to Donald's personality though), Max being ashamed of his dad for being Goofy, and Mickey scolding Pluto and yelling at him to get out. Whatever happened to Christmas cheer?  I would definitely not recommend this movie.",1451347200,,807,4.805755395683454
1783222,1,B00006JZI2,"Very disappointed in this film. The movie showed attitude and how not to behave in my opinion. It showed a competition between Daisy and Minnie where one was trying to out do the other. Each was determined to be the best and best the other. They reconciled in the end but you would expect them to encourage each other and be each other's biggest fan, especially in a Christmas movie. Having two very young girls, there is no way I will let them watch this movie again. The last thing I want is for them to learn to treat each other this way. Also, in Pluto's excitement to put the star on the Christmas tree he destroyed all of the decorations. Mickey yelled at Pluto and told him to leave, that he had done enough, which is where Pluto runs away. I couldn't believe the way that Mickey treated Pluto in a Christmas movie, remind you. I know it is important to watch shows with your children to explain behavior that you don't agree with but they pick up a lot of behaviors by things they see people do, including their favorite characters. I am extremely disappointed that a company which targets kids of all ages made a film where the characters act awful to one another.",1450828800,,1173,4.410138248847926
1783223,1,B00006JZI2,"I was watching this with my son, thinking it would be cute and filled with sweet holiday spirit. This movie was the complete opposite. I ended up having to turn it off! The pop-up where Mickey is decorating his house was my last straw. Seeing how angry Mickey was at Pluto was almost scary! I have never seen such a negative display from these beloved original characters. It opened up with Minnie and daisy being extremely ugly to each other while ice skating. Donald is usually a little upset but somehow his character is lovable. This movie took his character way too far. Huey, Dewey, and Louie were mischievous ducks who were only concerned with being rich and selfish! They literally said that's what they wanted. What kind of example is that?! Not one I want my little one to see! I just can't believe this was a Disney movie. It's completely uncharacteristic of any other Disney media I've ever seen, and I'm a Disney fanatic. Certainly not in the true spirit of what Disney has become to so many people and families. I never dreamed I'd have to turn off or monitor anything, especially an animated movie, made by Disney.",1450483200,3,1129,4.621890547263682

It's a shame so few know about it, and Disney hasn't created any similar films with the characters since.  The animation quality is far above Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, which ironically came out after.

1783339,5,B00006JZI2,"I love this DVD because it is so funny and it shows the true meaning and the spirit of Christmas. This film is just a hour short and it had only 5 stories. First is Belles on Ice. This story is about jealousy, competition, and feelings hurt between Daisy and Minnie who are trying to win the ice skating contest, but disaster strikes for the poor girls. Next is Christmas Impossible, a parody of Mission Impossible. At Christmas Eve, Donald's nephews learned a lesson from Scrooge McDuck about selfishness and it is a possible the boys are on Santa's naughty list. The boys had a selfish scheme to change Santa's list and they had many hilarious situations at the workshop. Third is Christmas Maximus. Goofy's son, Max is coming to visit his father with his pretty girlfriend from college. Poor Max tried to hid his father's embarrassing and childish schemes from his girlfriend. Fourth and my favorite is Donald's Gift. Donald Duck had finish Christmas shopping and he wants some peace and quiet with a beverage instead spending time with his nephews and Daisy. A Christmas song, ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"" kept ruining Donald's peace and quiet, even his beverage in many different hilarious situations, but Donald learnt the true meaning of the song. Last is Mickey's Dog-Gone Christmas. Mickey's dog, Pluto wants to help Mickey with the decorations, but the impatient Pluto ruined everything. Mickey severely punished the poor Pluto and he banned him from the house to decorations are done. Mickey almost lost his special friend and he learnt the true meaning of Christmas.

It's a fun video that is broken into several short stories - each with a moral that is learned by the different characters.  Probably not quite as good as the original cartoons that Walt Disney put out years back, but worth having if you have kids that love Mickey.",1357689600,,400,4.541666666666667

1783393,4,B00006JZI2,"We purchased this to have a special ""family"" movie night with our 2 young children, ages 2 and 3.  This movie definitely held their attention and we were even able to use it to teach them some lessons (forgiveness, selfishness).  We don't allow a lot of television or movies in our home and are extremely picky when it comes to what we allow our kids to watch.  And although there were some things on here that we weren't 100% thrilled with (competitiveness, stealing) we'd allow them to watch again.",1356307200,,500,4.595505617977528

1783395,1,B00006JZI2,"I watched the first one so many times.  This one was too much out of character for Disney.  Although I thought the animation was going to make this movie, the story lines are too adolescent for the behavior of Disney characters.  I do not understand 90% of the movie and I have no idea what they were thinking making such a RIP OFF from real Disney stories.  Furthermore, I would not let any child under the age 18 watch this kind of film.",1356307200,4,439,4.253012048192771

1783399,4,B00006JZI2,"Wasn't sure what to expect from this ahead of time, but here Disney has captured the heart of its traditional characters while employing more modern computer animation--something that other companies have failed at miserably.

It all starts with the script, and each of these five Christmas-themed shorts is good in its own way. I do believe that for whatever reason, they started with the weakest link (Daisy and Minnie in a jealousy-fueled send-up of Stars on Ice). The other four presentations are very, very good.

The shorts stand alone but also have a common thread. A narrator takes us through a beautifully-animated pop-up book Dr. Seuss-style, with rhymes to surmise and introduce each little story. Brilliant device. I also found it humorous that secondary characters and themes present in one short often popped up incidentally in others. Great writing!

Most of these are gorgeously-animated with incredibly beautiful Christmas scenes. Again, not so sold on ""Belles on Ice""--for some reason it looks clunkier to me--but everything after that is fantastic.

Even the extras, which include some games and behind-the-scenes vignettes, are well done.

In brief, this is a can't-miss Christmas purchase.",1355961600,,1210,5.347368421052631

Minnie and Daisy bullying each other on the ice rink I was horrified by the the whole first episode on this disk. the other were ok but I really couldn't get over the message that being mean is fine until someone gets hurt.

This delightful film teaches all the right lessons in a light-hearted and meaningful way, with real kids (and adults) in mind.  I can't believe that I have to explain what is happening in the ice skating number, but it's pretty normal to feel competitive with a friend and even adults can argue and still be friends in the end.  I agree that if you watch some of the older Disney, Mickey is more slapstick than he is on Mickey Mouse Clubhouse but, again, my son is learning the right lessons.  And it's a lot of fun at Christmas which is the most important thing!!",1260748800,,678,4.479674796747967
1783445,5,B00006JZI2,"This video consists of five different stories, each one entertaining and humorous.  The stories are introduced using an open storybook with pop up pictures and cute rhymes.  It is computer animated and done well.

First, Minnie and Daisy challenge each other in an ice skating competition.

Next, Huey, Dewie, and Louie take a trip to the North Pole to try to write their names on the good list.

Then, Maxie worries about bringing his girlfriend home to meet his dad, Goofy, for Christmas.

Donald then has trouble catching Christmas cheer.

Lastly, when Pluto makes a mess of the Christmas decorations, Mickey sends him to the doghouse.  Feeling unloved, Pluto ends up adopted by Santa's reindeer.

This is a classic Christmas movie with my family.  My husband and I enjoy it, and now our children love it, too.  They request it over and over again.  Entertaining Christmas fun!",1260230400,,880,4.91156462585034

Mickey's twice.... is the second installment in the series by Disney and it's the best of the two.  The CGI graphics that make up the animation are excellent and amazingly capture the personalities of each character.

The whole DVD lasts about 70 minutes and is comprised of several short subject cartoons.  Their really isn't a bad cartoon on the DVD.  I especially enjoyed the first toon with Minnie and Daisy, and the one with Pluto on the north pole, but all of them are excellent.  I hope that Disney will release more of these holiday themed dvd's in the future.

This is such a cute Christmas animated movie!  Has several short episodes with all the different main characters!  My son's favorite character is Mickey Mouse and my daughter loves Goofy so both are pleased when I turn this on cause they both know their favorite character is coming on.

Cute animation and a nice song (during Goofy's segment). I wish Disney would make more shows like this with stories, as opposed to an interactive type show The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse which gets tiresome very quickly. I preferred this to One Upon a Christmas, the animation in this one is far superior, and just more fun in general.

1783459,5,B00006JZI2,"After watching Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas(which I thoroughly enjoyed),I decided to also buy it's sequel(being a lover of all things Christmas and Disney).

It was only when I bought it,I realised it was computer animated...
(This was also the first time the Disney characters were seen in 3D animation).

'Oh here we go'...I thought to myself.

I usually find that when Disney uses computer animation(apart from Pixar,which is obviously brilliant),it takes the charm out,so I really dreaded seeing how awful this was probably going to be.

But...I was pleasantly surprised!
I actually thought that the computer animation added to it's appeal and made Huey, Dewey and Louie look even cuter than usual!

The short 'films' included are:

""Belles on Ice""
""Christmas: Impossible""
""Christmas Maximus""
""Donald's Gift""
""Mickey's Dog-Gone Christmas""

If you are looking for a sweet,family,Christmas 'movie' then I would definitely suggest this as it is just as good,if not better than the first 'Upon A Christmas'.

1783469,5,B00006JZI2,"I don't understand the numerous reviews that gripe about how mean-hearted and cruel the five stories that comprise ""Mickey's Twice Upon A Christmas.""  Not only do these stories hearken back to a time when slapstick humor was highlighted in cartoons, they do it with slick-looking computer animation.  It's great to see Mickey, Donald, Goofy and the rest of the gang brought into the next century WITHOUT blowing off what made them legends in the last century.  Only two characters seem a little ""out"" of character, and that's Minnie and Daisy in the first short of this film, ""Belles On Ice.""  Jealousy is a cold villain, and it bares its teeth when Daisy and Minnie have an all out (on ice) brawl to decide who's the better skater.  Sure, these two are usually keeping Mickey and Donald in line, but this time around they are the ones getting into trouble.  Of course, in true Disney fashion, the duo eventually listen to the voice of reason, and we are then treated to the first of two Donald tales, ""Christmas:  Impossible.""  Okay, this one really showcases those mischevious nephews of his, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, but Donald does get a nod here.  The boys make a mess of the North Pole, nearly destroying Christmas when they decide to make some adjustments to Santa's Naughty/Nice list.  In ""Christmas Maximus,"" Goofy's son Max brings his girlfriend home for the holidays and hopes that his dad doesn't embarass him.  Does Goofy come through?  Do I really need to answer that?  In ""Donald's Gift,"" the crankiest fowl in Disney history gets tired of everybody wishing him a merry Christmas and just wants to settle down with a nice cup of cocoa.  Needless to say, peace and quiet are two of the hardest things to find during the Christmas season.  Lastly, Mickey learns a hard lesson about friendship  in ""Mickey's Dog-Gone Christmas.""  When Mickey jumps on Pluto a bit too hard about tearing up some Christmas decorations, Pluto runs off to the North Pole and, well, becomes a sort of mascot for the reindeer.

Needless to say, all of these shorts have happy endings.  Some folks say that these stories are too violent but they obviously have never watched older Disney fare featuring these classic characters.  Please do not let a few people who only want their children to watch ""sanitized"" and boring cartoons get you down.  If you enjoy slapstick humor, a little mischief, and aren't afraid of your child seeing a puppy actually get verbally scolded, ""Mickey's Twice Upon A Christmas"" is an excellent DVD to add to your collection.  It has easily found a welcome space on our DVD shelf and I highly recommend it.",1194739200,2,2621,4.777777777777778

1783474,4,B00006JZI2,"After getting this DVD from the library last year, I knew that my son was a big fan of Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas. In fact, so was my husband. He's an artist, and very critical of shoddy animation. However, with this DVD, he often comments on the well-done, vibrant images of computer animation. (If you're a parent of a child, you probably already know how shoddy some of the CGI can be in kid videos! Happily, this is not rendered poory like some movies.) In fact, I was amazed at how Mickey's sweater looked so real, as well as the snow-covered trees, holiday lights and Christmas trees, Minnie and Daisy's gossamer skating outfits, and so on.

An open ""Storybook"" presents each tale, and we are whisked away into five magical stories showing true-to-life situations involving relationships. (And you KNOW how the whole family/relationship thing can get during holidays... *wince*).

Clever writing abounds, as well as numerous sight-gags. My son and I think it's hilarious when Huey, Dewey and Louie burp to a Christmas song--and when Daisy implores Donald to ""say something!"", he burps in response.

For those who think this DVD is mean spirited and violent, I have to say it seems like I was watching an entirely different movie than they apparently were... I mean, the classic Huey, Dewey and Louie animated shorts AND comics always presented their mischief. In fact, in the original theatrical shorts, the nephews were sent to live with Donald because their father was in the hospital! Why? Because the boys sent him there by putting firecrackers under his chair! (So I hardly think that ol' Walt is rolling in his grave. Lighten up, people--this is the guy that gave us Fantasia! You know, the movie that features Night on Bald Mountain, the song about the nocturnal demon Chernabog who summons restless souls from their graves until driven away by the sound of a church bell.)

If you want to see nasty kid programs, try renting a Thomas the Tank Engine DVD!

Granted, the Minnie/Daisy catfight and pettiness was surprising (thus, the reason I'm giving it four stars), but reality isn't sugar-coated Disney dreams. Friends often have jealousy, children are often onery, Dads can be grumpy at Christmas (and while shopping) and so on.

I'm very cautious about what I let my son watch, and I don't object to this fine holiday DVD. (Because we live in a house WITH manners--and we stress kindness--my son is quick to point out sad moments...and ones where people are behaving not-so-nicely.)

My family and I are huge fans of slapstick comedy (Jerry Lewis, Dick Van Dyke, etc.), so Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas is a real treat in the humor department. The colors and details of the animation is absolutely stunning. For example, Donald goes behind the curtain at ""Mousies"" (Macy's) to investigate their annual animated production. It's done with a black light, so Donald and the lighted animatronics have a very cool glow that can be only found with black light effects.

I especially like this episode because of the clever sound effects: surrounding Donald in the mall are people and machinery that mimic the song ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas""--change in the till, a blender, puppies barking, etc.

In the store, I gave my son a choice between Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas and Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas, and not surprisingly, he chose this one. (We just bought it last night and he's already watched it four times--the last time, while he sat on my lap and we cuddled.)

This DVD also has some extras:

*A behind the scenes look at how animators were inspired by skating sensation Michelle Kwan

*Deleted Scenes - How the structure for the movie unfolded, and why they picked certain stories for the DVD

*Several Games and Activities

*DVD-ROM Holiday Printables

If you're concerned that this DVD might be too controversial for kids, rent it first. If you like it, show it to your kids. You'll soon know whether you want to purchase it or not. For me and my family, we feel this is an EXCELLENT purchasing decision.",1162944000,32,4044,4.832127351664255
1783475,1,B00006JZI2,"I made the mistake of watching 'Once Upon a Christmas' and loviing it.  It was sooo Disney.  It moved me to tears near the end of each short.  Well done animation and overall theme.  When It finished I unwrapped and watched 'Twice Upon A Christmas'.  Big mistake.  It was like retro back to the first Simpons  episode when the voices were different and the animation not as clean.

The 3D effect is cool, but lacked any detail to make the characters believeable.  But I am getting a head of myself.

I couldn't believe my eyes when I watched the cut outs of Minnie and Daisy get squashed by a tree ornament as the announcer foretold in a gloomy voice that something bad was going to happen.  The bulb falling actually made me jump.

I watched the feud between the two skaters and it never made me laugh.  I thought along the lines of what they say to each other at the end of the clip.

The short about the boys, who like to create trouble, made sense they were causing trouble, but I'm not sure all of their trouble could be made up for adding Scrooge's name to the list of good boys and girls.

Mickey really looked like he was going to hit Pluto.  Thats all I'll say.

Overall it was the animation that made put the DVD back into the box and put it on my shelf.  I do not expect to watch it again and I do not intend to tell anyone to buy it.

If you want Disney Christmas, get the first one, Once Upon A Christmas.

I have every Disney animation movie, and all the Disney Treasure Series on DVD.  This is the only one I will not recommend and it only takes one bad apple to ruin a pie.",1159747200,8,1589,4.144262295081967
1783476,1,B00006JZI2,"My kids saw the preview for this and asked for it incessantly, so we bought it. How could it be a bad idea? I mean, it's Disney, right? The worst that could happen would be a few dozen awful songs you can't get out of your head. No. While this movie only had a few horrible songs, the real problem was the movie itself.

The stories are CRUEL! The cardboard pop-up animation is even violent and mean, with Minnie and Daisy fighting and at each other's throat, then being flattened by a pair of glass balls, and Mickey raising his hand--LITERALLY--to Pluto. My son asked if the mouse was going to hit Pluto. In a Disney christmas cartoon, my son had to ask if Mickey friggin Mouse was going to abuse his dog.

Minnie and Daisy both want to ice skate, and get to perform a christmas show. Minnie gets to go first, and jealous Daisy skates right into her performance and does her best to screw it up and take the spotlight, to the point of ending up with Minnie falling flat on her face and getting hurt.

Huey, Louie and Dewey are a trio of badly-behaved punks who steal christmas cookies and decide to break into Santa's office so they can write their names on his Good list when they're told they've been too bad to get visited by Santa this year. They decide it's too late to make up for it, as it's xmas eve, and start talking about putting horrible things in Donald's bed, which they decide to do after they've done breaking and entering at the North Pole. When they get there, they practically destroy the place, ruin xmas for everyone else and run away when the friendly elves ask them to help clean up. Then, when they get home, Santa rewards them for this awful behaviour with a ton of presents and a note saying thanks for helping at the Pole. Huh?

Goofy's son Max brings his girlfriend home for the holidays, and the theme song played for this skit says it all: ""Make me look good."" The hell with the holiday spirit, just make me look good for my gf.

The ducks get together to celebrate xmas, and Donald gets ticked, then smashes a caroller display right in front of all the little kids waiting to see it.

Minnie complains about Mickey decorating too much, and he takes out his frustration on Pluto, who runs away and finds a friendly home with Santa's reindeer. When he and Mickey are reunited, Goofy comes half an inch from running them over with a snowplow. And not in a comedic, cartoony way, either. The plow is drawn with some menace to it, and the music builds it up, so that when Mickey and Pluto are covered with snow, you find yourself wondering if they actually are road kill.

This film is nasty and mean spirited, cruel and heartless. The short stories just showcase the downside of christmas with the most horrible situation and awful behaviour they could come up with and still get a Disney G rating. Yeah, they walk in at the very end with a so-called ""happy"" ending, but it's shallow and surface, with no real lesson learned or kindness performed. The cardboard pop-up animation is even cruel, with Minnie and Daisy fighting and at each other's throat, then being flattened by a pair of glass balls, and Mickey raising his hand--LITERALLY--to Pluto. My son asked if the mouse was going to hit Pluto. In a Disney christmas cartoon, my son had to ask if Mickey friggin Mouse was going to abuse his dog.

None of this movie is funny, or heartfelt. The tagline on the front of the box says ""Find out who's been naughty and who's been nice"". Walt must be rolling in his grave at the horrible injustice perpetuated on his beloved Mickey Mouse.",1158192000,19,3566,4.450229709035222

1783478,5,B00006JZI2,"This is a movie you could watch every day for a month, and not fry your brain.

I know, because I had to. My son was obsessed.

The five shorts comprising ""Twice Upon A Christmas"" are all delightful, and perfect family viewing.

First I must say that the digital re-creation of our favorite animated characters has been done to perfection. Eye-popping crystalline perfection.

The Minnie-Daisy ice skating duel features those dancing hippos and crocs from Fantasia, and beautiful digital effects and designs.

Huey, Dewey and Louie's journey to the North Pole has a classic caper feel to it; it's fast and funny. When one of the little guys drifts a little too close to a snoring Santa's breath, he initially winces. Then he smiles and says, ""Hm! Peppermint! With a hint of mocha!"" It's cute. My wife and I laugh, and my 2.5 year old wonders why.

Goofy and his son Max has some nice musical numbers in it. Again, seeing these characters in their three-dimensional glory is a sheer delight. I liked the moral of this piece, not quite sweet enough to give you cavities, but close.

Donald's discovery of Christmas spirit is also a heart-warmer, and here the animators show off their magic and skill in giving innumerable facial expressions to our favorite hysteric.

Mickey's Christmas party, with Pluto going off to be a reindeer is a fine ending to a great set of cartoons. Paying attention to the dialogue pays off as well; the creators have inserted lots of sly asides for us older folks.

Kids will be entranced...literally. Adults will totally enjoy this. It reminded me of the way I felt when I watched those stop-motion Rankin-Bass classics as a kid.

After watching this Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas DVD...hey, I 'm back into the disney world again! This DVD is so cool that not only the kids will love it but even we adults too! I really like all the 3-D effects they made and hope to see more of them. Will there be a Mickey's Thrice Upon a Christmas DVD next year?

1783492,5,B00006JZI2,"OH MY... so many people seem to be so upset about Mickey, Donald, Goofy, Minnie, Daisy, and the rest of the team... maybe they need to watch the MOVIE and CONSUME some of the lessons being taught here.

For what it's WORTH, I purchased this movie for my CHILDEN and we love it.  I said it once, so I'll say it again.... if anyone is interested in whether a movie works.... come and let Marquis (5) and Jade (2) watch it.  If they stay quiet long enough to repeat the movie, join in the singing, and request the movie then it's a MAJOR HIT!

Okay now with that out the way....This movie has 5 individual stories...

(1) Belles on Ice-

Minnie and Daisy fight over whose the better skater. Minnie and Daisy learn that being jealous of the other isn't helping and as they work together they both come out on top.

(2) Christmas Impossible-

Huey, Dewey, and Louie are spoiled, and selfish.  ME...ME...ME as they plot to add their own names to Santa's list, they learn to help others, and are rewarded for putting selflessness ahead of their own WANTS.

(3) Christmas Maximums-

Maxi, all grown up and ashamed of his clumsy father just wants to impress this girl that he can't see that all his father does is to show him that he loves him.  As Maxi opens his heart he can see that his dad is perfect.

(4) Donald's Gift-

BA HUM BUG....Donald isn't in the spirit and he is tired of hearing the bells, the chimes, and the cheer.  He wants to just relax in peace and quiet.  As he tries he finds that his attitude has just about ruined the season for his family.  He adjusts and makes it a fighting chorus sees that it isn't what's on the outside; it's what's inside that counts.

(5) Mickey's Dog-Gone Christmas-

Tree (check), lights (check), punch (check) as Mickey obsession with having the best Christmas party forces him to punish Pluto.  As Pluto leaves Mickey discovers that it's not a party if all your friends aren't there.

This DVD will surely get you'll into the spirit of things...

1783493,5,B00006JZI2,The dvd is visually superb. My 2 year old LOVES it and she watches it at least once a day from begining to end. I was sceptical at first about the CGI animation but when I saw the movie it was great and I hope disney continues to develop this technology.

1783494,5,B00006JZI2,"Disney's been dabbling in the magic of CGI ... and for our family, at least, the magic worked.  We often all laughed out loud at the same places (2 adults, a 6-year-old and a 3 1/2-year-old), and the adults chorused, ""Wow"", when the CGI effects were especially impressive (e.g. the popcorn scene.)

This movie's similar in theme and style to the earlier ""Once Upon a Christmas"", which my kids still thorougly enjoy and continue to watch, even with the new one.  But the computer-generated animation of ""Twice"" gives an almost 3D effect which, pardon the expression, adds a new dimension to the story ... more texture to the experience; like good special effects in an action movie or subtle highlights in a silk garment.

Who knows if hand-drawn cartoons will still be made 50 years from now?  For that matter, who knows how old-fashioned our current CGI will appear then?  What I DO know is that our family STILL enjoys the ones drawn 50 years (and more) ago ... and that each decade of animation has its own slightly different style and its own unique appeal.  So I won't fret that CGI will destroy the beautiful old-fashioned style of animation; it's just another dish to add to the smorgasbord of family entertainment.

Congratulations on a great addition to family holiday traditions, Disney.",1102550400,2,1297,4.8108108108108105
1783495,5,B00006JZI2,"Disney's done it again! Their follow up to the wonderful ""Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas"" is nearly as delightful as the original! I say nearly, only because I still consider 2D animation to be more appropriate for the classic Disney gang, particularly in this case, due to the way it conveys the warmth and heart of the holiday season (and then there's the whole issue of Mickey and Minnie's ears). Still, this computer animated treat is extremely entertaining, endearing, and, to say the least, mesmerizing.

This delightful holiday movie tells five Christmas tales about our favorite Disney characters: Mickey, Goofy, Donald, Minnie, Daisy, Pluto, Huey, Dewey, Louie, Max, and my personal fave, Scrooge McDuck. The first of these is ""Belles On Ice,"" wherein Minnie and Daisy are both scheduled to perform in a town Christmas skating show, but when their competitive natures get the better of them, they end up taking things too far. Not to worry, the two are fast friends again by the end, and the little spat makes for some very thrilling and humorous CG eyecandy.  The sweetest part (besides Daisy, whom I've always had a liking for) is the fact that Minnie's backup skaters are none-other than the alligators from Fantasia. And Daisy's? You guessed it, the Hippos!

Following that fun fiasco, we have what is probably my favorite story of the bunch, ""Christmas: Impossible."" The title is a take on ""Mission: Impossible,"" though most of the spoof aspects were dropped in early production. This is a great duck tale in the spirit of the classic Carl Barks comics, complete with Scrooge, Donald, Daisy, and the boys attempting to celebrate Christmas in Scrooge's stately mansion. Things go awry when Huey, Dewey, and Louie's antics interrupt the festivities one time too many. After a thorough warning about not being put on Santa's good list from their Uncle Scrooge, who claims to have suffered that fate himself, the boys lie in bed worrying that Santa won't bring them any gifts that night. Soon, they are on a mission to Santa's workshop to add their names to the ""Good List"" themselves! I found this story particularly enjoyable, most likely because of my fondness for the Scrooge and other duck comics I grew up with. Before the Duck Tales TV series came along, my old comic book hero had only 2 cartoons to his credit. It's so nice that they've kept him around!

  ""Christmas Maximus"" is the next yarn in the bunch. Now, even though I love the Goof and his boy, this is probably my least favorite on the disc. Why, you ask? Because of the story. Well, actually, it's almost more of a music video. For one thing, the song is pretty bad, but the main thing is, we've seen this scenario too many times before. Max is worried that his dad, Goofy, will embarrass him in front of his new girlfriend when he brings her home for the holidays. I loved the show ""Goof Troop,"" I loved BOTH Goofy movies, but how many times will we have to see Max stressed out about being embarrassed by his dad as the central plot? I know it's something people can relate to, and I know it's something most of us never stop feeling about our parents from time to time, but the least they could do was have a new plot and just make that embarrassment part of the character's personality, since that's what it actually is. I mean, ""House of Mouse"" covered Max's embarrassment of his dad enough already, as did the Goofy movies. Nevertheless, it's not altogether unwatchable. It's cute, and heartwarming, just a little too ""deja vu."" On the upside, Max's new girl, whose name escapes me just now, is quite the cutie. However, I'm rather distressed that Max is no longer with Roxanne, his girlfriend from ""A Goofy Movie"" AND ""House of Mouse."" I know High School relationships rarely last, but these are cartoons! They're usually soooo loyal! And Roxanne had really grown on me! Well, the yummy Kellie Martin's voice didn't hurt.

The final two stories feature Donald and Mickey respectively. First up is ""Donald's Gift,"" where the tormented duck is desperate to spend some quiet holiday time relaxing with a cup of cocoa. But, with the hectivity of the holiday season (yes, I invented a word), he just can't seem to pull it off. In Donald's effort to enjoy Christmas the way HE wants to, he ends up making a mess of a big Christmas show everyone is waiting to see. Daisy and the nephews go all guilt trip on him, and in the end, Donald changes his selfish ways and learns a valuable lesson. Now, I didn't totally get this one. A hard working duck deserves a few moments of quiet and cocoa at Christmas. Is that so selfish?! The program rounds out with ""Mickey's Dog-Gone Christmas,"" the most advertised and praised story of the set, and well deserved. This is a tale of a mouse and his dog. As Mickey decorates and prepares, perhaps a little too much, for a Christmas party for all his friends, the over eager pup gets a bit carried away and makes a mess of things. Mickey gets upset and Pluto goes into the doghouse, but the poor dog takes things a little too hard and runs away. Before we know it, Pluto is adopted by Santa's reindeer, and Mickey is left dogless. Heartbroken, the little mouse searches all over town, posting ""lost dog"" posters and even making a plea to a department store Santa. Luckily, Santa knows just what to do, and the two mopey pals are reunited just in time for the whole gang to gather together and celebrate Christmas!

""Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas"" is a charming new holiday tradition from the folks at Disney, whose Direct to Video offerings have been showing a lot more promise lately with this one and ""The Three Musketeers."" It's a shame their theatrical animation has gotten so weak and low budget. It's not CGI the public demands, it's quality storytelling and art. In this film, the computer animation is better than I would have expected from direct to video, and so is much of the writing. The characters' personalities and voices are wonderfully played, and it's all wrapped up together with gorgeous ""pop-up book"" style intros and credits. The extras include some great deleted scene info, a look into how the animators used Michelle Kwan as an ice skating reference, and a few games that might be amusing to the younger set. Nothing overwhelming, but one-disc Disney DVDs rarely are.  Still, you can't go wrong with this buy if you're a fan of the Mouse and the Christmas season!",1102550400,3,6406,4.697239536954586
1783496,2,B00006JZI2,"My husband and I picked this up thinking it would be a nice addition to our Christmas movie collection.

As the first story unfolded, the one with Minnie and Daisy ice skating, I was surprised by how petty and obnoxious the characters were acting.  They act like real jerks to each other for a prolonged period of time (particularly Daisy) then at the very end say ""Oh. Sorry!""  It wasn't enough to redeem the behavior.

The second story likewise showed Huey, Dewey, and Louie acting like real jerks--spoiled brats. Real terrors. Through the whole story, they act incredibly, singularly horribly. Then at the end, they make a gesture that's supposed to be very special, but just doesn't excuse their previous behavior. I love the ducks but wish this had been a story about helping others or doing some good.

The Goofy section wasn't quite as bad--a son feeling embarassed about his dad's behavior, but then realizing that his dad really is a lot of fun. A nicer message, even though Christmas is only loosely related to the story.

Bottom line, this just wasn't the sweet heartwarmer we expected Mickey to be. I wish there'd been less mean-spritedness and more giving. If we can't have generosity and cheer at Christmas, then when can we?",1102377600,20,1239,4.793427230046948
1783497,1,B00006JZI2,"This is the worst Disney product ever.  It's little more than an animated ""pop-up"" story book.  Gone are any vestiges of Micky, Donald and friends that you would automatically expect.  They're replaced by animated ""pop-ups"".  Who ever dreamed this up needs to be given a ""pink slip"".  Disney has reinvented the DVD into an another advertising platform.  Rent it at Blockbuster and save $20+ if you have to see it. P",1102118400,5,415,4.774647887323944
1783498,5,B00006JZI2,"Having been a fan of Disney animation all my life (let's say 37 out of a possible 42 years at least), including personal experience with animation, I'd like to share one tangible benefit of the new generation of CGI graphics.  I purchased the DVD around two weeks before taking my family to WDW.  I have a two-year old daughter, who we call ""Princess"" as she certainly relates to the Disney princesses, whether they are the classics like Cinderella and Snow White, or her more contemporary friends, Belle and Ariel.  I thought it would be wise to introduce Mickey and all his friends before visiting his Florida home, so we gathered to watch this newest Christmas feature.  To say the least, my daughter was captivated by the animation, and I was dually impressed as well.  What really struck me however, was her reaction while at Disney World.  I believe the realism of the 3-D graphics made it a whole lot easier for her to relate to the actual characters that we later met in the various parks.  As great as the Disney classics have always been, at the young age of only two, the translation into real time does not always happen.  Twice Upon A Christmas leaves no doubt about the 3-D realism.

I don't need to dwell on the story lines any further than what has been discussed by others - they are simply creative entertainment that can be enjoyed by all.  I did appreciate some adult oriented lines throughout the different stories, especially from Huey, Duey and Louie in their features, as well as Daisey and Minnie's verbal exchange in the middle of their skating battle.  The reindeer are pretty entertaining in Dog-gone Christmas - definitely a departure from the claymation classics of old.

I'll admit that when you watch the video for the 20th time in two days, you'll need something else to keep you occupied, however your children will be glued to every word.  Even though you may get tired of the repetitve viewings, take another look and enjoy the subtle details throughout.  Whether it's the glittery sheen of the Christmas tinsel, the realism of the swirling red punch in Mickey's punchbowl, the dust on the floor beneath Pluto's rug, or the cracks that form in the snow just before it breaks away to fall on Mickey's head, take a moment to enjoy the layers of creativity that went into each scene - much more than could ever have been accomplished with 2D.",1101945600,3,2375,4.677884615384615
1783499,4,B00006JZI2,"I got this DVD as a gift and really wasn't expecting much of it (figuring this was more of a ""kid's"" DVD).  Well, Twice Upon a Christmas is basically a kid's DVD, but there's plenty adults can appreciate on it.  The animation is great (similar to Pixar) and the storylines are well written.  There are 5 stories, each one teaches a different lesson.  The 1st one, Belles on Ice features Minnie and Daisy and some of the aligators and hippos from the Dance of the Hours sequence in Fantasia.  Both Daisy and Minnie each want to be the star in an ice skating show.  But when they compete against each other, the show is nearly ruined, so they learn to work together and be friends again.  Christmas: Impossible features Huey, Louie, Dooey, Uncle Scrooge and Santa Claus.  After Donald's nephews are punished on Christmas Eve for hogging the cookies, Uncle Scrooge tells them that the way to make Santa's list is not by getting but by giving.  They quickly rush to the North Pole to try to get their names on the list, but learn the real secret to getting on the list.  There's an interesting toy called Jailbreak Bob, who has an Edgar G Robinson voice (""Let me out, see?"").  Christmas Maximus features Goofy and his son Max.  Max comes home for Christmas with his new girlfriend and begs Goofy to try acting a little cooler and a little less ""goofy.""  Eventually, Max learns to appreciate his father just the way he is.  In Donald's Gift, Donald gets quite annoyed by all the commercialism in Christmas and just wants to be left alone with his hot cocoa.  It's not long before he learns how to share the real joy of the season.  Finally,Mickey's Dog-Gone Christmas features Mickey, Pluto and some of Santa's reindeer.  Mickey tries hard to make the perfect Christmas.  But when Pluto makes a shamble just for trying to help, Mickey gets mad and banishes Pluto to his doghouse.  Pluto feels dejected and runs away, leaving Mickey to search for Pluto.  Meanwhile, Pluto meets up with Santa's reindeer and tries to help them with Santa's sled.  Listen for the running gag about the disaster in '64 (probably a reference to the Rankin/Bass Rudolph special which was 1st aired in 1964)!  The extra's are interesting with some deleted scenes and a brief interview with Olympic skater Michelle Kwan, whose moves were used in the Belles on Ice sequence.  The games are good for children (adults may find them a little cheezy).  If you have children, they'll probably enjoy it and you might enjoy watching it along with them.",1101859200,,2514,4.661363636363636
1783500,3,B00006JZI2,"Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas is about Mickey and his friends, having some problems and then problem solved. The movie contains couple of little stories just like the first movie.  have seen the first movie of the ""Upon a Christmas"" movies, and thought that it was pretty good, not good, but just okay-good. So I decided to get it and watch it with my brother, who is two years old. I think that this movie really changes the tradition of Mickey Mouse movies. The computer-animated Mickey and friends are really cool, but the problem is that the plot, and story is just, not so interesting, like the first movie. The whole movie is not so entertaining and just bored me off. The good thing about this movie, and the one thing that stands out is be good all the time, and show some Christmas spirit. Yes, is very educational, but is just educational in a Barney way. I don't know about the kids' opinion, because afterall, I am fifteen, and thing that the movie is just bit too kiddy. Anyway, my brother didn't really like it that much either, but I guess that I have to recommend it to the kids, because I think that it might teach them something about Christmas.",1101513600,3,1165,4.495283018867925
1783501,4,B00006JZI2,"My children were so excited to watch this DVD - and naturally I was happy to comply.  It didn't hold my attention quite as well as it held their attention (natural, I suppose - they are the intended audience at 3 and 7 years old) but I enjoyed the messages from the Fairy-Tale Like stories as well, told in modernesque animation (that I learned a lot about reading the words of other reviewers here at Amazon.)

I especially enjoyed Minnie and Daisy learning to not let competition get in the way of their friendship... I truly smiled inside when they said, ""what were we thinking?""

Disney also enhances vocabularies - using phrases in the introduction such as ""egos get bruised""  and ""so cordial and nice"" (little ones learn EGO and CORDIAL in the blink of an eye.)

I also loved the generosity of spirit in the short starring Huey, Doey and Louiey (how badly did I misspell those names?)  and the sweet tale of Maz and Goofy  could have warmed the ice out of my freezer.  My almost thirteen year old enjoyed that one - there was a part of it that was almost like a music video.

My children also enjoyed the Bonuses - which are an important aspect of all our DVD viewing - sometimes the bonus features are more important than the DVD itself!

Twice Upon a Christmas is the perfect video to pop in while you are wrapping presents and need some private time.",1101427200,6,1359,4.443548387096774
1783502,4,B00006JZI2,"My only disappointment with this DVD was that it wasn't longer. The five shorts on this DVD were great, especially the one with Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck as dueling ice princesses and the story of Pluto's adventure's at the North Pole hanging out with Santa's reindeer. I thought this last story could've been a feature length tale in itself.

While I agree with many that seeing the characters in full-fledged 3D animation, I don't think this new rendering of these wonderful characters could have been done any better. No, it's not animation of the quality in the top budget motion picture releases, but it's nonetheless extremely well done.

If you love Christmas and you love Mickey and the gang, you and your family will love this DVD.",1101427200,15,742,4.7890625
1783503,5,B00006JZI2,"So far, the biggest knock on this film is the fact that it's all 3D CGI.  Apparently there are cell-animation (2D)fans who feel this is the wrong move.  Well, I have a friend who worked for Disney (Little Murmaid, Oliver and Company) and Pixar (Toy Story 2, Finding Nemo).  I grew up with him (3rd grade in 1973 until now)and become a hugh fan of animation of all kinds (especially Ray Harryhausen films).  I have collected every Disney cartoon I could afford (and enjoyed).  I even dabbled in animation myself.  So I think I have a pretty good perspective on this subject.  Here's the scoop...

-Cell animation is VERY EXPENSIVE.  If you make a crappy film (Home on the Range) you basically wasted 3 to 4 years and millions of dollars.
-You may have noticed that computers have been used in 2D animation for about 20 years now (I think ""the Great Mouse Detective"" was the first)
-Computer animation requires artist to design the characters, give them meaningful motion, character, emotion etc.  In other words, you still need to be an artist to do CGI.
-ALL MAJOR STUDIOS HAVE SCRAPPED CELL ANIMATION, INCLUDING DISNEY. It's simpley too cost prohibitive and CGI films (even the Made-on-the-cheap ""Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius"")MAKE HUNDREDS OF MILLONS OF DOLLARS!!!  Consumers, for the most part, LOVE CGI!
-Once you create a computer character, you can file it away and use it again later (Though they seam to get upgraded with the latest technology regardless).  This saves tons of time and money.

There's alot more reasons CGI is the choice of studios today.  Does this mean cell animation is no good?  The way I look at it, about 30 more CGI movies need to be made to catch up with the existing cell animated features already in existance.  I love films like ""Fantasia"", ""Sleeping Beauty"" and even ""Spirit; Stallion of the Simeron"".  But I can understand why a studio would be unwilling to pony-up money for cell animation when the option to use CGI is nearly a sure-thing financially.  It's not going to happen.

NOW ABOUT THE DVD:

-My 2 year-old enters the house after day-care with the words ""Mickey Mouse"" and ""Donald Duck"".  He's definately spending too much time in front of the TV, but he does love it.
-Hence, I've seen it about 15 times in the last 2 weeks.  Yea, I'm sick of it, but it still manages to entertain me on some bizarre level.
-When I first saw it, I realised this was Disney's future.  It was well enough executed that I did not mind.
-Plenty of extras for those seeking content value.
-Most reviews here give an accurate sense of the stories.  I enjoyed most of them (the one with Goofy will be dated in a few years).
-Good sound and picture.  Actually very nicely rendered.
-My 6 year old was completely engrossed during her initial viewing.  The stories just sucked her in.

I hope this is helpful to those trying to cope with the ""demise"" of Hollywood cell animation.  Perhaps some day, we will be complaining that the new digital holographic movies lack the charm of the old CGI films.",1101254400,6,3017,4.6521739130434785
1783504,5,B00006JZI2,"This long awaited sequel to "" Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas"" is now a fully Computer animated feature with 5 tales involving Minnie Mouse with Daisy Duck competeting against each other in a ice skating contest, Huey Duey and Luey are trying to get on Santa's good list, Goofy trying to act cool for his son with girlfriend visiting on Christmas eve, Donald trying to get peace & quiet on Christmas eve day until he gets delusional by blowing his cool then learning to find it in his heart about the christmas spirit and finally Pluto runs away from home to find himself at the north pole on Santa's workshop.

A marvelous attempt of having disney's beloved characters including Scrooge Mcduck ( whom you remembered from the first movie and Ducktales) in computer animation, these stories are quite original and give good reasons about why Christmas is a season of love, giving and kindess, it's a must see.

The DVD is sharp in quality with a few good extras like how they studied Michelle Kwan for the skater story, deleted scenes with filmmakers point of view and games mostly for younger audiences.",1101254400,3,1102,4.734375
1783505,2,B00006JZI2,"I know the 3-D/CGI worshippers will dislike my heresy, but if ever there was a place NOT to use CGI, this is it. Most of these characters have been around for almost 75 years in their hand-drawn form, and that's what made them special. There was no need to re-make our favorites into what looks like plastic McDonald's toys, and these should be stuffed back into the bag (Santa's?). I'm glad I finally found a place to rent a copy rather than buying one, and it's obvious that the rental houses agree with my assessment, as I had to check on Netflix, two Blockbusters, and one Hollywood video before I could find a lone copy at a third Blockbuster.

1783506,3,B00006JZI2,"Both the animation and story in ""Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas"" can probably best be described as ""Pixar-Lite"".  That is, the computer technology that renders Mickey and his friends throughout this DVD is generally well done and even at times dazzling, but overall falls fairly short of the uniformly excellent work we've seen in the ""Toy Story"" movies, ""Finding Nemo"", ""The Incredibles"", and other Pixar projects.  Likewise, the several Christmas stories included here all have perfectly fine, fairly imaginative stories, but they certainly aren't the highly creative, multi-leveled / multi-themed yarns that- again like Pixar's offerings- appeal across the board to kids and adults.  This one is mainly for the kiddies, I'm afraid.  But I guess there's nothing wrong with that.  Kids, especially young ones, will likely really enjoy this, and adults- while not being wildly entertained- certainly won't find it painful to sit through.  After all, Disney's classic characters are always fun to see in action.  I still can't figure out why Goofy can talk and Pluto can't, though.",1100649600,5,1081,5.323529411764706

For one, I am just glad to see a DVD based on the Mickey/Minnie, Donald/Daisy Goofy and Pluto clan. My daughter loved then at Disney this year and it is hard to find new stories on them.

I think the fact that they have ""updated"" them leaves some parents yearning for the good ole days but the kids LOVE this advance stuff and its fun to watch my 3 yr old in awe of it.  If you have been to Disneyworld and enjoyed Philarmagic, then you will LOVE this. Same exact concept minus the actual 3-D with glasses. The animation is wonderful, and the voices of Donald, Mickey, Minnie, Goofy were right on. Daisy and the nephews were not so good - but kids don't really notice that stuff. Seeing Scrooge Duck was great too as I loved Mickey's Christmas Carol growing up.  I only wish they added a story about Chip and Dale and Donald. Those were always my favorites.

My 3 yr old said the Minnie/Daisy story and Mickey/Pluto were her favs although she watched the entire thing without moving and laughed out loud a few times. Myself and my husband had quite a few adult laughs too. The lessons learned here were very good too but I think mostly kids 5 and older would truly understand them.

I am just really glad Mickey and the gang are back again. The Three Musketeers and this in one year leaves me hoping Disney will be adding them to more movies in the upcoming years.

The animation artists of the past could draw, paint, and ""amimate"" with a subtlety that is still missing from CG animation. But they are two different kinds of magic. (And this comes from a big fan of both kinds - The Incredibles, for instance, is a total treat ...) Maybe our old friends should be spared the hi-tech treatment.

But back to Mickey & Co ... the voices didn't impress me, and the stories are a bit more sit-com-contrived than cartoon-crazy. That said, my little six-year old friend liked it pretty well. She liked the skating a lot - although I didn't care for the Minnie-Daisy feud premise, I agree the choreography is fun. We both thought the duck voices were generally un-ducklike. Her favorite was the Goofy and Max piece.",1100217600,,1171,4.684466019417476
1783511,4,B00006JZI2,"I always expect to see a Disney product done in the traditional 2-D cell animation, so when I first watched this DVD, it took a little getting used to. After a few minutes of getting over this shock, it simply struck me...WOW! I feel like I can reach into my TV and grab the 3-D characters right off the screen! If anyone is familiar with the 3-D Viewmaster, this is like watching an animated version of that. The stereo 3-D effect (done by selectively focusing the various planes of animation) is fantastic. I'm still not sure if both the characters and backgrounds were all done in 3-D or if maybe some of the backgrounds were done with practical set pieces. The only problem with this DVD is that some of the 6 short stories are quite long, and if given to a younger child, they may loose interest. So don't expect the traditional 3 minute Disney cartoon format here. But the style and depth of the animation may keep everyone glued to the set,so the length may be a mute point. As with all newer animated stories, there seems to be a focus on telling a moral. Each of the 6 short stories here do have a moral to tell. Not that this is bad, but I kind of miss the old Disney toons where rough (near violent) slapstick humor was the focus.",1100131200,2,1241,4.330472103004292
1783512,4,B00006JZI2,"I'm not a huge fan of CGI movies. Shrek's okay and Monsters Inc had it's moments, but I've just never been a huge fan of it. However, I decided to reserve judgement on this one until I saw it. I got it as a gift, so I might as well watch it.

It was fairly short (only 68 minutes long). The animation quality may not be up to par with Pixar, but it's still pretty good.

The most important thing, beyond the technical animation is whether it's fun or not. I'm surprised to say I actually enjoyed it. The skits were actually entertaining. I haven't really watched Mickey and the gang since I was a kid. It was nice seeing them in action again. And whether your a big fan of CGI or not, it still boils down to entertaining stories that will help get the entire family in the Christmas spirit.  It's sure to be a hit with the kids especially, but also the adults.",1100044800,4,860,4.168674698795181

7970891,5,B00006JZI2,"My son loves this movie and wanted to watch it when he wanted, which didn't coincide with the TV schedule. I love our Amazon TV service for shows but noticed almost every movie and even some series are all a pay-per-view style or an upcharge. I think this is ridiculous considering I already pay a monthly premium to use the service. Hulu does not operate like this, which we also have. In the future, unless it's something that we cannot get on DVD or that we can't wait to catch on our DirecTV, we won't really be purchasing any more movies through Amazon.",1513209600,,558,4.427184466019417

7970893,5,B00006JZI2,"I love this movie. Ive seen a lot of comments on how disappointed some parents were with how the characters acted. The thing I liked about it was that the characters actually acted like real people. Im quite sure everyone has made choices that weren't always the greatest and there were consequences. In this movie in each story there is a conflict in which a character may act poorly, but by the end, there is a moral in which the character learns that maybe if they had acted differently in the beginning than the consequences they endured maybe wouldnt have happened which Im pretty sure is something we should instill in our children considering they are also going to make poor choices at some point in their lives. My son loved the movie and all a parent simply has to do is interact with their child letting them know that Mickey yelling at Pluto maybe wasn't the best choice he made. Definitely a favorite Christmas movie of mine.",1512777600,,938,4.589285714285714
