Documentary
The documentary was what the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Hardcore/dp/B00005A066/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE - Hardcore</a>&nbsp;VHS contained. It is based on WWE's hardcore matches, not anything ECW or any other promotion did. This documentary is hosted by Tazz. Tazz was a fantastic choice for this documentary. He gives a legit feel to the entire documentary. This documentary gives you the thoughts of many different wrestlers about hardcore wrestling. Also, it will show you clipped hardcore matches: from Mankind VS Shamrock, to Al Snow VS Bob Holly(which goes all the way to the Mississippi River), to Shane McMahon VS Steve Blackman(Shane falls 50 or so feet). Overall, you will enjoy the documentary.

1405856,4,B000059HJ5,"Documentary

Even if you're not a long time wrestling fan or hardcore division fan, you'll still feel right at home from the very beginning of this documentary on hardcore. The movie is hosted by former ECW Champion and Multi-Time WWF(e) Hardcore Champion, Tazz, so there's no question as to whether or not he knows what he's talking about. Right off the bat, various WWE superstars, hardcore or not, give their own definitions of what exactly ""hardcore"" is, and what it means to be hardcore. Soon after the movie begins, you'll have been educated on hardcore and the fact that it's not just a title, it's a way of life.

Next up on the agenda is a full chapter dedicated to the Hardcore Legend himself, Mick Foley, complete with interviews, his picks on some of his most hardcore matches, and clips of some of the most brutal moments in his illustrious career, including his street fight with Triple H at the Royal Rumble, and many other moments from the WWF and various other promotions around the globe.

Also featured in this film is some early action that will really give fans a sense of how the hardcore division was when it first started out, and a good history as to previous champions and how it evolved into what it is today. From there, the DVD goes on to cover ""who is hardcore"", including a unique look at some of the women of hardcore and their infamous locker room brawls.

Moving on, the DVD covers another one of the matches that shaped just what hardcore is - the Al Snow versus Hardcore Holly match that saw both men battle all the way out of the arena, across the street, and right down into the Mississippi River! Appropriately following that match, there are some rather humorous interviews with wrestlers recalling their worst injuries as a result of hardcore matches. These interviews are worth it for the humor alone, especially the words of wisdom from the likes of Chris Jericho and Mick Foley.

More in depth coverage of some classic hardcore matches including a six man battle royal and the now legendary Mick Foley versus Triple H is shown, and then we are treated to another important part of the DVD, especially for newer wrestling fans - a segment on the Hardcore Title 24/7 Rule, and some clips from early 24/7 matches that mostly deteriorated into unsanctioned battle royal matches or three on one attacks.

In another interview-heavy portion of this movie, we're treated to some of the most hardcore superstars' memories of their favorite matches, followed by an in depth chapter on the A.P.A. and their impact on the hardcore division, including some sick bumps that were delivered along the way, including Shane McMahon and his much talked about 50-foot fall from near the top of the arena during SummerSlam 2000.

Lastly, Tazz introduces a few final clips that help ""mop"" up the DVD into a very fitting ending. As was mentioned before, this DVD definitely serves its purpose in giving WWF(e) fans, new or old, a vividly detailed history on the Hardcore Championship and the hardcore division, long with some great clips of brutal moments and hilarious happenings along the way. If you call yourself a wrestling fan, and you don't already own this disc, do yourself a favor and go buy it right now.

The Extras

Even though the video and sound on this disc may not be all that you were hoping for when you heard that WWF Hardcore was getting the special DVD treatment, your complaints will mean nothing after checking out this huge extras section, including a whopping 20 bonus hardcore matches from the WWE's past. Here's a complete breakdown of the awesomeness:

Hardcore Holly vs. Bart Gunn - Raw - 2/22/99 - Chattanooga, TN - Lots of glass gets shattered, and nearly everything from ringside (including a watermelon and a crate of bananas) is used in this title match from the early days of hardcore.

Crash Test - Smackdown - 2/24/00 - Nashville, TN - Crash Holly takes on the big man, Test, in a hardcore match with some unexpected interference from Crash's cousin Bob at the end.

24/7 is Born - Smackdown - 3/2/00 - Trenton, NJ - Tazz and Crash Holly's hardcore brawl all over the arena quickly deteriorates into a giant display of mass confusion that unsuspectingly goes on to make hardcore title history with the creation of the 24/7 rule.

Laundry 24/7 - Smackdown - 3/9/00 - Boston, MA - The Mean Street Posse interrupts Crash while he's doing his laundry, attacking him in an attempt to capture the hardcore gold. The end result is one of the funniest segments in wrestling history.

Airport 24/7 - Raw - 3/13/00 - Meadowlands, NJ - Another funny Hardcore Title segment involving Crash Holly and the Mean Street Posse. Unfortunately this segment suffers from its lack of commentary.

Funtime U.S.A. - Smackdown - 3/16/00 - Long Island, NY - In the funniest of all 24/7 segments (and possibly one of the funniest WWF segments of all time), The Headbangers chase Crash Holly through an amusement park in attempt to capture the HC gold.

Crash vs. Hardcore Holly - Raw - 3/27/00 - Houston, TX - The Hardcore Cousins go at it in an attempt to find out which of the two it truly the most hardcore, but they are rudely interrupted by a gang of uninvited guests looking for the title.

Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy - Smackdown - 4/27/00 - Charlotte, NC - This match is a brother versus brother collision in which the two siblings battle to see which one will walk out with the hardcore belt around their waist.

Hardcore Brisco - Smackdown - 5/18/00 - Detroit, MI - In another absolutely hilarious 24/7 segment, Gerald Brisco, one half of Mr. McMahon's stooges, pins a sleeping Crash Holly for the Hardcore Championship. The end result? Comedic genius!

Hardcore Patterson - Raw - 6/19/00 - Nashville, TN - A title celebration takes a turn for the worst when Pat Paterson attacks fellow stooge Gerald Brisco in an attempt at capturing the title.

Big Boss Man vs. Steve Blackman - Raw - 9/4/00 - Lexington, KY - Another traditional hardcore style match with all the weapons and fixings that make the hardcore division so great, but to be honest, this match isn't anything too spectacular.

Edge & Christian vs. Steve Blackman - Raw - 10/2/00 - Washington, DC - Edge and Christian managed to con their way into a supposed ""triple threat"" hardcore match that turned out to be more of a 2 on 1 assault than anything. As always, E&C are good for a laugh, and a great match while they're at it.

Steve Blackman vs. Tazz - Smackdown - 10/19/00 - Cleveland, OH - Blackman has a grand ole time beating the hell out of Tazz with everything he can lay his hands on in this hardcore title match.

Tiger Ali Singh vs. Steve Blackman - Raw - 11/30/00 - Ames, IA - This isn't the greatest hardcore match in the world, but it's pretty funny, especially some of the commentary that goes along with it.

Raven vs. Undertaker - Smackdown - 12/14/00 - Little Rock, AR - The Undertaker captures his first ever hardcore title in his first ever hardcore match by pinning Raven for the 1-2-3 after a vicious last ride through an announce table.

Triple Threat - Raw - 2/21/01 - Phoenix, AZ - In The Rock's first ever ""official"" hardcore match, he takes on The Big Show and Kurt Angle and lays the smack down on each of their candy-asses like only ""The Great One"" can.

WrestleMania X-Seven - 4/1/01 - Houston, TX - Kane, The Big Show, and Raven battle all throughout the Astrodome in Houston, going through walls, steel fencing and even a piece of the WMX7 staging in one of the most memorable hardcore title matches in recent history.

Backlash 2001 - 4/29/01 - Chicago, IL - Two of ECW's former greats, Raven and Rhyno, lock up in a hardcore match and take it to the extreme, like only they know how. Any ECW fans should see this, although it seems watered down compared to old school ECW.

Judgment Day 2001 - 5/20/01 - Sacramento, CA - Test, The Big Show, and the champion Rhyno go at it all over the arena in a hardcore match that saw a brand new innovation in an attempt at victory - the wall pin!

Big Show vs. Rhyno - Raw 5/21/01 - San Jose, CA - In a rematch from the pay-per-view the night before, the Big Show and Rhyno put another hardcore clinic, only without the third man from Judgment Day, Test.

The Video

Unfortunately, because of the nature of World Wrestling Federation programming and its live broadcasts, this DVD isn't as crisp and crystal clear as it could be, but that's not to say that it's no good. You aren't given any display options on this disc, so the lack of choice between widescreen and fullscreen is of course a real bummer, but because of the discs use of original source material, everything is just about as good as it can possibly get, given the circumstances. On the plus side of things, the menus, although not fully animated, are good-looking and extremely easy to navigate, and during play everything seems to flow together nicely. Sometimes, depending on the footage used, some moments are sharper and more colorful than others. This is not something that should really ruin the overall experience for casual movie watchers that bought this DVD as more of an educational wrestling tool, but after all, this is DVD we're talking about, and there are certain things that have come to be expected, and this time around, WWF Hardcore falls a little short of par.

The Audio

Once again, there are no options on this disc to choose between stereo sound or 5.1 surround, so WWF Hardcore isn't really anything special to go raving to you friends about, sound wise. However, the sound is still up to average DVD quality, and it's nice to hear some of your favorite matches called nice and clear (with the exception of all the screaming from the rabid fans), rather than muffled like you may find it on you TV every Monday and Thursday night. It has its strong spots and its weak spots. Overall, the sound isn't terrible, but it's definitely nothing to brag about. They can do better than this.",1149638400,9,9950,4.625638116846285
1405857,5,B000059HJ5,"I own both and in my opinion the dvd was 100 times better with all the extra matches some of the extra stuff was lame tho like the brisco and Pattersn clips.. those were a waste of my time. The other matches were awesome tho i really like the last matches on the dvd, The Documentary part was better on the dvd for giving the first hardcore match(its kool to see the first one) and the 6 man match from backlash that was sweet as hell.
buy this dvd it rules",1122422400,,457,4.032967032967033

Big Bossman vs Al Snow Hardcore Title SummerSlam 1999

1405859,5,B000059HJ5,"I love crash shane matt (jeff), still I love this DVD most of all. The 24/7 thing, I love it but the truth is, you gotta stop every few mathes you watch becuse you MIGHT get bored of the hardcore thing, take it from me (or don't) if you get tired of it you might not go back. be Carfull (and get spellcheck, I've read some reivews)",1116547200,,331,3.955223880597015
1405860,5,B000059HJ5,"This was a division in WWE that they need to reinstate. It is a breath of fresh air, rather then to hear Triple H, Stone Cold, or The Rock take up the whole show. The dvd is well done, and has amazing footage and the best documentary ive ever seen so far on any WWE dvd. The 20 extra matches are short, but they are still fun to watch. I highly recommend this dvd to any WWE fan who loved the hardcore divison.",1108512000,4,410,3.9518072289156625
1405861,5,B000059HJ5,"This is #22 out of 130 greatest WWE DVD's.  This DVD is filled with Hardcore matches that will be truly remembered for a long time.  There is only a couple matches worth reviewing.

Shane McMahon vs. Steve Blackman was a match that was just crazy because Shane falls 50 feet of the TitanTron and Blackman jumps off the TitanTron 25 feet to pin Shane and win the Hardcore Title.

Raven vs. Kane vs. Big Show was a great match and Raven was obviously the underdog and I truly wanted him to retain but Big Show won the title when he smashed a box over Kane.

This DVD is awesome I would definitly pick it up because it has great Hardcore action.",1102204800,3,642,4.2727272727272725
1405862,1,B000059HJ5,"If you love hardcore wrestling, then avoid this! It's not hardcore, except for the streetfight between Cactus Jack & Triple H from Royal Rumble 2000. The other matches stink. WWE has had its share of good hardcore matches, but not like ECW, XPW, or NWA. Over the last couple of years, the WWE has revolved too much around stupid storylines and wrestlers who portray silly comic-book characters. I'd rather watch a wrestling show that has real athleticism and not two men in underwear pretending to fight. The WWE doesn't take its hardcore matches seriously. Heck, they ruined the hardcore championship with the pathetic 24/7 rule. They use fake blood too much. The matches are becoming so darn predictable and dull. A few great matches a year isn't enough to make me wanna tune in every other night of the week. My suggestions: how about some ECW, XPW, or NWA? Now that's real hardcore athletic entertainment.",1043712000,2,909,4.870967741935484
1405863,4,B000059HJ5,"Firstly I must say that this video/DVD is fantastic. However the biggest problem is in regards to the difference between the DVD and VHS versions. First I bought it on video, then when I saw that the DVD had an extra 20 matches I bought the DVD with the intention of selling my video version. However, I found that there were differences between the actual program on both versions. Instead of the Al Snow vs Road Dogg, and the Boss Man vs Al Snow matches which appear on the VHS version, the DVD has a Mankind vs Ken Shamrock match and a 5 or 6 man (I can't remember which) battle in their place. There is also some of Tazz's talk missing on the DVD. I found this to be dissapointing, as whether you buy the video or DVD, you will still miss out on some good matches. Despite this, it is a very good buy and I shall be keeping both copies.",1026259200,5,840,4.159509202453988
1405903,5,B000059HJ5,This movie was without a question one of the very best movies I've seen so far. Everything that this movie has is great(HARDCORE STYLE). WWE superstar Tazz was a great great host. This movie is truly hardcore. I would greatly recommend everyone on buying this hardcore movie.,1024531200,,275,4.872340425531915
1405904,3,B000059HJ5,"WWF Hardcore is the WWF's first attempt at highlighting the Hardcore Title. As I write this review, the belt is around the waist of the Undertaker (2/04/02). In all honesty, I guess I expected more classic hardcore moments of the hardcore such as some of the actual Mick Foley and Terry Funk matches. Instead, this DVD highlights more recent happenings with the WWF. In all honesty, the video itself isn't that good but the bonus matches that are included are very enjoyable. And hey, it's hosted by Taz (Tazz), so how can you go wrong there? If your a fan of WWF's hardcore style then this is definatly a worth-while DVD.",1012694400,,622,4.612612612612613
1405905,5,B000059HJ5,"Great video! I definitely recomend this. Sometimes WWF videos can prove disappointing, and this looked like it may have ended up being one. It was not in the least disappointing, however. A lot of great hardcore action. Sure, the ECW always did it better, but this is the best stuff the WWF can give you and still be considered family entertainment. Tazz makes a great host and I really think they should push him more than they do. They should especially give him a lot more mic time. Have a nice day.",1003276800,,502,4.467391304347826
1405906,4,B000059HJ5,"Once again, Vince McMahon and the WWF have put out another quality DVD.  GREEN is basically a history on the WWF Hardcore Title, not to mention some of the more prominent hardcore matches.
GREEN could have shown more, but that is what marketing is all about.  This DVD can't have everything.  What it does have is the amazing street fight match between the Legend of Hardcore, Cactus Jack a.k.a. Mick Foley, and the greatest professional in the business, Triple H.  There are several other excellent matches, including the much talked about match between Al Snow and the Road D-O-Double G.
GREEN is hosted by Tazz, who is quickly becomming a superstar on the microphone.  He has had his fair share of hardcore matches, and using him on this DVD was a good choice.  The picture quality is superb and the sound is excellent.  This is a really good DVD and a worthy purchase for any fan of professional wrestling.",996883200,3,910,4.685534591194968
1405907,5,B000059HJ5,"I'm assuming some of the other people who reviewed this DVD wrote their opinions based on the VHS version, because some of the things I read are untrue. For example, the person who said:
  ""They didn't show many hardcore matches""
  So the 20 matches they added exclusively to the DVD in addition to the other matches on the tape isn't a lot??
  Or,
  ""Rhyno isn't even on the tape""
  Not like that's a big deal if he wasn't, but he IS on here! (The person was probably referring to the VHS version, which came out before Rhyno even debuted in the WWF)

Yes, this is a VERY up to date DVD as you can see. It also features other classic hardcore matches like the Cactus Jack/Triple H Street Fight from Royal Rumble 2000, and some earlier hardcore classics with Al Snow, Road Dogg and Hardcore Holly.

Rhyno isn't on it and he is hardcore, most of the matches consist on al snow vs road dogg or big boss man.  most of the matches on the video aren't even hardcore matches, you have street fights, no holds barred and tlc matches. The only good thing about this is the streetfight between foley and triple H. That is a fantastic match and worth the whole price it self.

7933508,3,B000059HJ5,"This was a DVD I just bought because I found it cheap, used, and it advertised 20 matches on the back. However, I have to say that this DVD was somewhat a disappointment because if you read the back of the DVD case...you'll see them advertise barbed wire baseball bats, steel cages, tacks & tables & chairs, and parental discretion is advised yet a majority of the 20 DVD extras matches are focused on the Hardcore Championship back when it was a comedic prop for the 24/7 storyline they did with the Hardcore Title.

The documentary is done by Tazz who is in character the whole time & basically follows the format of showcasing some of the hardcore matches from that era with wrestlers commenting in-between on various subjects like what & who they consider hardcore along with hardcore injuries & memories. Mick Foley also gets his props on here as a hardcore legend & talks about some of his hardcore moments in WWF like his Boiler Room match against Undertaker, RAW match against Terry Funk, when he was awarded the Hardcore Championship and we later see highlights from his Royal Rumble street fight with Triple H.

The matches in the documentary include:
Hardcore Champion Mankind vs. Ken Shamrock - This was not only the first defense of the Hardcore Championship but a special ""Champion vs. Champion"" match with Shamrock being the Intercontinental Champion while Mr. McMahon & his associates watched from the top of the stage. Mankind came into match with his ""corporate makeover"" wearing a suit which was eventually used as a weapon by both men with the action spilling to the floor with weapons & the environment used in different ways as the fight continued all the way to the stage area in what a physical match that set the standard for what to expect in his new division.
""RAW"" Nov. '98

Tori vs. Ivory - The first women's hardcore match that started out with Tori (wearing only a white thong & shirt) attacking Ivory in the bathroom with them fighting through the men's locker room & the shower that Jacqueline was using before Ivory won & burned Tori's back with an iron.

Al Snow vs. Bob Holly - Road Dogg had to forfeit the title due to injury setting up this match between the former J.O.B. Squad members. The match made it's way into the crowd & backstage early as both men used whatever they could get their hands on from the fire extinguisher, glass, trash cans, floor tiles, metal trays, mops, and even a payphone. The fight continued to outside of the building & made it's way to the Mississippi River where both men continued to use whatever they could from road signs to a wheelbarrow, and even the camera getting hit with a broken piece of wood. This was one of the most memorable matches in the history of that championship as this was the birth of ""Hardcore"" Holly.
""In Your House: St. Valentines Day Massacre"" Feb. '99

Hardcore Champion Crash Holly vs. Matt Hardy vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Hardcore Holly vs. Tazz vs. Perry Saturn - One fall to a finish as this started is the isleway before the bell & quickly went to the stage area with more than one opponent climbing & coming off the stage with pieces of the structure broken & used as a weapon as we saw multiple objects used as weapons along with short term alliances made & long term alliances fighting against each other in what was non-stop action from start to finish.
Backlash '00

Hardcore Champion Shane McMahon vs. Steve Blackman - It should be noted that Shane won the championship earlier in the week (which is available on the Blu-Ray edition) using various shenanigans causing Blackman to stalk Shane all night leading up to match with Shane constantly trying to run away only for Blackman to finally get his hands on him & showed that he was more focus on torturing Shane than winning before Shane tried to use the same tactics that worked earlier in the week only to not only have a different result but also cause him to have what was up to that point the most memorable visual ever seen in the division.
SummerSlam '00

This DVD also comes with 20 bonus ""matches"":
Hardcore Champion Bob Holly vs. Bart Gunn - This match had a lot of history behind it as this was another ""Champion vs. Champion"" match as Bart Gunn was the Brawl For All tournament champion, both were former tag team championship partners as the New Midnight Express, and Holly was the only person Bart didn't defeat in the Brawl For All by knockout. Both men started this fight very physically busting glass objects & whatever they could get their hands on around ringside eventually leading up to some impactful moves executed the stage with the announcers questioning how certain objects they used got there in the first place as it ultimately came down to one of their competitor's past coming back to haunt them.
""RAW"" Feb. '99

Hardcore Champion Test vs. Crash Holly - Test easily dominating Crash including tossing him into the crowd while Crash used the weapons & environment to his advantage along with his lighter size for high risk that didn't always pay off but ultimately came down to unexpected help based off what happened right before the match.
""SmackDown"" Feb. '00

24/7 Is Born (Hardcore Champion Crash Holly vs. Tazz) - Crash Holly vs. Tazz - This match got taken from the ring to the crowd in the opening seconds before going backstage in a short contest that saw someone put into a section of the building that we've never seen before but more memorable for what happened afterwords that changed the entire hardcore division for the rest of it's existence.
""SmackDown"" Mar. '00

Airport 24/7 (Hardcore Champion Crash Holly vs. Mean Street Posse) - This took place at the airport which saw another WWE superstar & a maintenance match get involved in the action that was one of the early showing of how this title was a ""hot potato"" under the new 24/7 rule.
""RAW"" Mar. '00

Funtime U.S.A. (Hardcore Champion Crash Holly vs. Headbangers) - This was probably the most famous match during Crash's reign as the ""Houdini Of Hardcore"" as it took place in the family fun center of Funtime U.S.A. as they went through the arcade & playpen complete with Jerry Lawler's ""Pac-Man"" sound effects.
""SmackDown"" Mar. '00

Hardcore Champion Crash Holly vs. Hardcore Holly - This just turns into a bunch of people coming out to win the title from Crash such as Tazz, Headbangers, Viscera, Mean Street Posse, Funaki & Taka.

Hardcore Champion Matt Hardy vs. Jeff Hardy - Nope, this isn't their flop from Vengeance later in the year but it was a hardcore match between the two that saw Tazz & Saturn come to ringside before Crash was able to sneak in & win back his belt.

Hardcore Champion Crash Holly vs. Gerald Brisco - This was one of those times where the championship match occurred under circumstances that never happened before or since due to the 24/7 rule in one of the most comedic moments in the history of the title.
""SmackDown"" May '00

Hardcore Champion Gerald Brisco vs. Pat Patterson - Brisco just won back the Hardcore Title earlier in the night from Crash so Pat helped him celebrate by pouring champagne over his head...which got in his eyes causing him to be blinded before Patterson knocked him out & won the belt.

Hardcore Champion Steve Blackman vs. Big Boss Man - This went to the back where Crash & Dean Malenko interfered by throwing coffee in Boss Man's eyes before losing to Blackman...who took Crash & Malenko out afterwards.

Hardcore Champion Steve Blackman vs. Edge vs. Christian - Edge & Christian made it clear that they were going to work together from the start as they used the weapons & numbers advantage only for Blackman to counter with his martial arts style & weapons of his own in what was a glorified handicap match.
""RAW"" Oct. '00

Hardcore Champion Steve Blackman vs. Tazz - Blackman showing his use of hardcore martial arts weapons with an appearance from Crash Holly & Just Joe backstage.

Hardcore Champion Steve Blackman vs. Tiger Ali-Sighn - A one sided hardcore squash match for Blackman.

Undertaker vs. Raven - Just like the previous match, this was a heavily one-sided squash as Undertaker almost killed Raven ending with a last ride on the announcers table.

Hardcore Champion Big Show vs. The Rock vs. Kurt Angle - This was not only another ""champion vs. champion"" encounter in the history of the championship but also the first time the WWE Champion challenged for the title as this was setup to be punishment for Big Show getting involved in their championship match the night before as all 3 men interacted with each other in various ways such as two opponents working over each other only for the third to get involved as well along with some double teaming to take out the most dangerous threat in the match before things got completely out of hand to the point where the match ended in pinfall that has never been seen before or since.
""RAW"" Feb. '01

Hardcore Champion Raven vs. Kane vs. Big Show - This match started before all three men made their way to the ring as this brawled all the way through the crowd & backstage destroying everything in their way from windows & walls to part of the stage even running each other at one point including one man constantly being used as a weapon against his opponents in a crazy three way brawl.
WrestleMania X-7

Hardcore Champion Rhyno vs. Raven - This match started off with a bang & never let up as Rhyno's momentum worked in his favor running through Raven & his objects but also unable to stop himself in time whenever it was used against him in the ring or on the floor causing him to land on weapons from open chairs to stop signs including one time he missed hitting the gore on Raven but ran into something else that was another time we saw something in a match that we had never seen before as both men went non-stop from beginning to end in what was been called one of the most memorable matches in the history of the division.
Backlash '01

Hardcore Champion Rhino vs. Big Show vs. Test - Just brawl that went all over the place (including Rhino making a dent in a wall backstage) with the occasional weapon being used only to have things more impactful.
Judgment Day 2001

Hardcore Champion  Both men started fighting on the floor right away with Show using his superior size to his advantage around ringside & on the ramp only for Rhino to take advantage of a mistiming heavily focusing on a part of his body using the ringside environment & any weapon he could get his hands on as this match literally came down to one man delivering one impactful shot & move after another using the weapons to their advantage.
""RAW"" May '01

In the end, if WWE's hardcore championship matches & the whole 24/7 storyline satisfied you then I recommend but if you like more from your hardcore matches than just non-stop weaponsfest & clustered brawls then this is something you would want to pass up.",1205193600,2,10873,4.631879543094496
7933509,5,B000059HJ5,"By far this has got to be one of the best DVDs WWF/WWE has produced.  It's also a clear distinction of how far the writing quality has fallen since back then.

I was just a kid when I watched WWF in early 2000 and I feel I took it for granted.  Watching this DVD, I was brought back to the glory days of the Hardcore division in WWF, from 2000-2001, and the amazing feats of the likes of Crash Holly, Al Snow, Steve Blackman, Hardcore Holly, the Headbangers, Raven, and others.

Truly, there are plenty of hilarious moments, due to the best ruling ever given to a championship, the 24/7 rule, where anyone with a referee and a dream can win the Hardcore championship.  Spots are done in carnivals, arcades, backstage, in bars, all over local towns.

The documentary is well done, with Tazz being a perfect host for the event.  Interviews done with a variety of superstars are a fun touch, especially from the likes of Mick Foley.

Extras provide memorable matches, including one of my favorites, Al Snow vs Hardcore Holly, in which the match left the arena entirely and out into the local river.  Other matches are just as extreme, with plenty of hardcore without getting boring.

All in all, this is without a doubt one of the best DVDs produced by WWF, and has yet to be bested by any similar WWE release I've seen as of yet.  The nostalgia of watching the amazing hardcore performances, not only in violence but in comedy, is ripe and well worth the price.",1179792000,,1459,4.488636363636363
