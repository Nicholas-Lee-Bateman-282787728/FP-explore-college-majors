7671682,3,B01C2YOAYS,"Occasionally too cute blend of lesbian romance and crime drama (mostly the former) with a brutally bad twist ending that basically ruins what wasn't an especially good film in the first place.  Beatle (Michele Hicks) is a mentally ill lesbian loner who is a tow truck driver but also lives a fantasy life as a contract killer.  She is hired by a pretty blonde named Athena (Ever Carradine, daughter of actor Robert Carradine) to kill her.  In exchange Athena is supposed to help Beatle film an infomercial for her professional assassin business.

Michele Hicks and Ever Carradine have genuine chemistry and are frequently charming together, but the filmmakers never really come close to getting the tone of Guns For Hire right.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan's scenes as a torture loving heavy never really mesh with the rest of the movie and end up leaving a very sour taste.  The central romance between Beatle and Athena would have worked better if the filmmakers had shown just a tiny amount of restraint and didn't keep pushing the scenes so far that they become almost cloyingly sweet.  Then there's that twist ending, which is even more jarring than Jeffrey Dean Morgan's grinning sadist scenes.  The ending is meant to pull out the rug from under the viewer but it isn't set up at all and feels more like the filmmakers spitting in your face if you made the mistake of becoming invested in the characters.

There are certainly much worst ways to spend your time than watching Guns For Hire, but the uncertain tone, terrible ending and highly misleading poster make this one an almost guranteed disappointment.",1463011200,2,1607,4.857142857142857
7671683,2,B01C2YOAYS,"Ok, I don't quite hate this film, but I come so close to hating it that it doesn't really matter.  The production was done on the cheap, possibly to pay a couple of the actors.  Maybe this would have been a better film if they'd cast cheaper actors, and if they'd managed a better storyline (the storyline is ludicrous), and if they'd sprung for a director (who was that retard in the tall chair again?) , and if they had just given up and made this an unromantic, unfunny  romantic comedy or a musical with a cast of three with no actual music or......

  I feel I was cheated out of the rental fee, but that isn't amazon's fault.  I rented it from an automated video rental machine they laughably call a kiosk.  I'm just glad I didn't pay $17.99 for a copy.",1459814400,,759,4.258741258741258
7671684,4,B01C2YOAYS,"This is an odd quirky twisty indy style film that keeps the viewer engaged. Beatle Boyin (Michele Hicks) is being interrogated by Detective Randy Holt (Raffaello Degruttola). She is cool, calm, and quiet during his story telling which makes up the bulk of the film. Beatle is an assassin for hire. She has made a video and has a card advertising her assassination skill and towing service. There is also the printed brochure. Carla (Sarah Shahi) is a stripper/prostitute who Beatle hooks up with once a week. She also visits a ""shrink"" (Orlando Jones) who thinks her hitman persona is a fantasy. She meets Athena (Ever Carradine), a prospective client, and their relationship becomes complicated.

I had to keep watching the film as a quirky mystery with few characters. The humor is dry. The ending was unexpected.

8752076,4,B01C2YOAYS,This was a fun kind of strange film.  It is def an Indie film though the studio says Sony?  I enjoyed it not an award winner but very odd and entertaining never the less.  The cast was great.,1483142400,,191,3.973684210526316
8752077,3,B01C2YOAYS,"I tend to evaluate movies on the basis of their entertainment value.. On that scale I would give this movie a ""C minus"" mostly because of the truly bad script writing..  The ending was implausible and poorly thought out.  It was like there were two separate movie scripts by different writers and somebody thought it would be clever to put them together... with  a surprise ending.  That being said,  the acting was at least average or above..  With at least one exception where the casting was a poor choice ( the police detective ).  On the positive side,  Sarah Shahi playing a stripper was worth the price of a rental.  Anybody who is a fan of her's will probably enjoy seeing her in this role.  She has done a ton of stuff where the writing is superior..  and for the most part she nails it.  She was a Dallas Cowboy's cheer leader one year and had no dance background going into the tryouts.... and still got the job.... That is some kind of talent..",1472860800,,956,4.431034482758621

a popcorn movie for people who like movies with sex and violence, nothing more or less.
It suceeds on it's own modest terms.",1464912000,,209,4.25
