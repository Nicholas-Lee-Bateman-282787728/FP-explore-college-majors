8483636,4,B005QROHR4,"Pretty OK 60's West German-made, English-dubbed jungle adventure.  A pair of adventurers have to travel through the Brazilian jungle in search of their lost friend.  They drag along a failed missionary, his young wife, and a trio of scurvy bad guys.  On the way they find a white jungle princess, the adopted daughter of a local tribal chieftain.  She ends up the wife of the safari leader, inadvertently on his part.  My peeve about the goddess is that she is not much of a jungle queen.  She needs to be protected at all times.  Not like Tarzan or Sheena, who could hold their own in any situation.  I ordered a very good quality color DVD-R, NOT the Sinister Cinema version.  Different cover too.  Recommended for jungle movie fans.",1437868800,,735,4.671875
