1784991,5,B00006LPDC,"This funny movie is suitable for all audiences.  Though a bit of the humor is forced and predicable, I found that I didn't care.  The two dogs and the two inept ""bad"" guys make the movie an enjoyable romp from start to finish.  Anyone young at heart, who still has some youthful innocence will be able to go along with the action and have a ball of a time.",1300320000,,356,4.130434782608695
1784992,4,B00006LPDC,"We found this video in our public library and my boys think it is hilarious!  They have watched it over and over.  It's not as interesting for adults, but for elementary age kids, it's a winner!

There are a few ""scary"" moments when the boy is kidnapped...but the dogs find him and rescue him with great escapades.  Of course it's unrealistic, but that is what makes it funny.

Overall it's a great kids movie with the ""Home Alone"" feel to it.",1260230400,3,443,4.419753086419753

They all love dogs and cats and funny movies involving either pet so I know how much they will enjoy this. Like others have commented, this story reminds me of Home Alone but just with dogs instead of a little boy.

Update: My 2 great-grandchildren have came for a visit since I originally posted the above and we had a very enjoyable time watching this movie. Now my 7 year old great-granddaughter is ADD--hyperactive, but even she was able to sit and watch this movie--it kept her attention for the whole movie.

1785172,1,B00006LPDC,"I watched this movie with my Grandma last night because she thought it looked cute.

I will admit, the dogs were very well trained...but that's as far as it goes. I work with dogs all the time, and most of the dogs I know get confused if they walk on the wrong side of the tree with a leash on. There is no way a dog knows what olive oil is, or flour, or understand the premise of a exhaust pipe on a car.

And seriously, how slow was that car driving for those dogs to be able to keep up? Ten miles an hour??? With tens of thousands of dollars on the line, they sure don't seem to be in a hurry. I understand this is a kid's movie, but the behavior of the dogs was so blatantly absurd and unbelievable. A movie like Homeward Bound might give the dogs human personalities, but they still behave like dogs! The dogs in this movie launch such a better-ordered scheme than most humans would in the same circumstances.

Honestly, this movie was incredibly boring. Maybe an eight-year-old would like it, but there isn't any substance to the plot. Some of the banter between the two hired men was enjoyable, but that's as far as it went. I wish I had these two hours of my life back. Don't watch it unless you have little kids, or you will regret it.",1345766400,2,1244,4.196652719665272
7971540,3,B00006LPDC,"This made-for-tv movie is between a 2 to 3 rating.  Younger kids or senior citizens would rate it a 3, but older kids to middle age will rate this a 2 or lower.  The problem is the movie starts out okay, but then it goes into slap stick comedy in which the thugs get stupid while the dogs save the day.

The story is that the father is an ex-executive of a tobacco company and is about to testify against the tobacco industry, and he decides to take his wife with him to Washington DC for the senate hearing.  However, he leaves his little son home (around 8 years old) with his two dogs and a maid.  The tobacco company sends two thugs to the house to kidnap the kid and a few thugs to warn the parents that if they testify, their kid would be hurt.  Well, during the kidnapping, the two thugs are overwhelmed by the two dogs that seem to figured out how to cause these two dumb thugs to fall down the stairs or crash into the wall, etc.  This is a mindless movie that can be entertaining to someone who just wants to see silly things happen to these two thugs.  Due to the thugs having to act stupid, their acting performance became really poor and annoying at times.  The dogs did okay, but they really didn't do anything super impressive.",1522627200,,1242,4.228813559322034

You know the movie is bad when the dogs are better actors than the humans, but the humans get more screen time.

If the dogs were featured more, the movie would have been so much better but alas, they weren't given that opportunity. Have to say I'm shocked that reviews here have recommended this for...kids? The dogs are threatened (in words) with being killed, microwaved, put in an oven (I'm serious) and the kid is manhandled, threatened, bound and gagged and the maid is too!
