535854,3,6302985285,"Dobie Gillis is the literary creation of Max Schulman.  Schulman adapted his character for the big screen in The Affairs of Dobie Gillis (1953), and Dobie later made his way to series television, in The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis (1959-1963).  While in the popular TV series Dobie was a high school student, in The Affairs of Dobie Gillis, the character, played by Bobbie Van (1928-1980), is a student at Grainbelt University, and has his eye on pretty coed, Pansy Hammer (Debbie Reynolds).

At first it appears that Pansy is all about education, but she soon changes her mind and takes to partying with her new boyfriend, causing her father much concern.  Soon the couple are in a bit of academic trouble, and after Pansy blows up the chemistry lab, she father sends her away to New York City.  With the help of his friends Charlie Trask (Bob Fosse) and Lorna Ellingbowe (Barbara Rurick), Dobie tries to find a way to get back together with Pansy.

The film also features some musical numbers, with performances by Van, Reynolds, Rurick, and Fosse in his acting debut.  The multi-talented Fosse (1927-1987) was a dancer, choreographer, director and writer.  He won the Best Director Oscar for Cabaret in 1973, beating out among others, Francis Ford Coppola who was up for The Godfather.  Fosse also directed films like All That Jazz (1979), and Star 80 (1983).

As the more established star, Debbie Reynolds received top billing, although Bobby Van's character is the focus of the film.  As Max Schulman wrote the screenplay, the movie probably plays out in the way he envisioned, but as a leading man, Van is something of an acquired taste.  Among those also featured in the cast are Lurene Tuttle, Hans Conried, Kathleen Freeman, and Charles Lane.

Those familiar with the TV version of Dobie Gillis, which featured Dwayne Hickman as an amiable high school boy, and Bob Denver (Gilligan's Island) as his beatnik buddy Maynard Krebs, may find the movie version lacks the same kind of innocent juvenile charm.  The Affairs of Dobie Gillis plays like many other teen romantic comedies of the era, but is probably worth a look if you are a Reynolds, Van, or Fosse fan.",1330819200,2,2167,4.821621621621621

This 50s film I had wanted to see for years and I was not disappointed. The main stars are Debbie Reynolds, Bob Fosse & Bobby Van. I am somewhat surprised that this musical comedy ended up in black & white unlike most MGM musicals of the era. Bob Fosse's type of dancing is very noticeable. I enjoyed this film and will view it again & again. I also enjoyed the comedy TV series, The Loves of Dobie Gillis which was produced for Fox TV during this period. Recommended. The print is clean on this DVD-R MOD release.",1325980800,2,582,4.938775510204081

535858,5,6302985285,"What a pleasant surprise for a hardened old cynic like me. Ordinarily I would avoid a title like The Affairs of Dobie Gillis as if it were the plague. But the sheer bounce and charm of Weis's direction along with Van and Reynolds proved completely beguiling. Sure it's dated. The innocence and idealized portrayal of college-age youth belong to a bygone era. Still, Van's easy way with a song and a smile continues to captivate, while even Reynolds' manages an energized side that doesn't annoy (the sight of her pony-tailed wholesomeness crouched demonically over a boiling witch's brew is hilarious). Surely these two were made for each other in some malt-shop heaven. There are so many nice touches, including: Hans Conreid's arrogant professor (his tight-lipped barbs at Dobie are priceless), Kathleen Freeman's gap-toothed Polish band (I'm sorry we didn't hear more), and the utterly delightful song and dance numbers (a whole lot simpler and more spontaneous than MGM's over-produced foot-stompers of the day). Clearly, the studio dribbled out a bare-bones budget to give their younger talent a chance, and the youngsters responded in spades. I'm only sorry that Van didn't get the career his talent deserved-- watching him and Fosse was a treat. All in all, this is a much better movie than it had any right to be, and a fine piece of unexpected pleasure for viewers of any age.",1138492800,24,1385,5.0
535859,5,6302985285,"Why don't they make movies like this one anymore? Let's face it, the world needs them. No violence,no swearing, no explosions except for the Science Lab. Good harmless clean fun. Of course this movie would never set the world on fire, but who cares. Extremely likable and easy to watch. Hurry up with the DVD version!

But one sad note, all of the main actors with the exception of Debbie Reynolds have all passed away at the time of writing (2004)",1115164800,10,448,4.530864197530864
535860,5,6302985285,"The Affairs of Dobie Gillis is another metamorphosis of Max Schulman's character. All of Schulman's writing is hilarious. There were Dobie books, on top of the show, movie, and musical. It's incredibly hip and wonderful social satire. Bobby Van is wonderful and it's unfortunate he didn't act in more movies. The best line in the movie is: ""Work's alright for workers."" Watch out! At the end you get to peak at Happy Stella Kowalski and her Schotische Five.",1012694400,4,457,4.871794871794871

535988,3,6302985285,"I bought the movie after seeing clips of the dance routines.  Bobby Van, Bob Fosse, and Debby Reynolds
are enough to create dynamite. You would think the movie would be legendary.  You find out very fast
that the rest of the movie is really bad. There is some rationale following ""Good News"" and the other
forgettable movies about college life in the early part of the last century.  But, does the writing have to
be that bad?  The movie makes the TV Series ""The many loves of Dobie Gillis"" look like high art.

Still,  those few minutes where Bobby Van sings and dances are magic.  And let Bob Fosse have the floor
then stand back. He taught generations to dance but his own abilities have to be seen to be believed.
Just those few minutes are well worth the price of the DVD.",1376179200,,777,4.391608391608392
535989,4,6302985285,"The Affairs of Dobie Gillis, is a lightweight entertainment and a pleasant viewing. It is amusing to read the reviewers speak to the wholesomeness and innocence of the movie, the time it portrays, and the time when it was filmed. At bottom this is a movie about a college slacker who will cheat on a major essay, routinely break college rules while aiding and abetting equal slacking on the part of his girlfriend. Much of this movie can be viewed as a 1950s Fast Times at Ridgemont High combined with Ferris Bueller's Day Off. A young and talented Debbie Reynolds sings a couple of popular tunes. Bobby Van stars with his more open and easy-going dance styling with the acting debut of Bob Fosse, a more precise dancer and soon to be leading choreographer of this day. Adding value to this movie is Hans Conrad as the uptight and easy to dupe English professor.

The plot, such that it is traces the pairing off of Dobie Gillis (Bobby Van) and his great love Patsy Hammer (Debbie Reynolds) and the second bananas Barbara Rick and Bob Fosse in a parallel romance. Patsy's father George Hammer (Hanley Stafford) is a classic overbearing father and a mass of Freudian fears. He correctly anticipates that Dobie will be a bad influence on his daughter while Mrs. Hammer (Lorene Tuttle) manages her husband with a minimum of words and gestures. Her performance provides some of the best and most humorous movie moments. Our leading loving pair mostly ditch college, engage in an extremely G- rated love affair, while singing and dancing pleasant songs.  The conflict such as it is arises when Mr. Hammer removes Patsy from the campus moving her to New York forcing Dobie to engage in some dubious use of the college newspaper's tight budget. Out of this we get one more comic moment when Kathleen Freeman enters leading the Happy Stella Kowalski Chadash band.

For movie billed as a musical it includes only two songs: All I Do Is Dream of You and I'm Through with Love plus the major song and dance number: You Can't Do Wrong When Doing Right. Fortunately these pieces are enjoyable.

Adding to the value of this otherwise frothy entertainment is the chance to see young actors in the early years of what will become three remarkable careers.

 In an era that tended towards hugely complex choreographing the simplicity of this movie sums out to a relaxing time.",1360713600,5,2359,4.7274939172749395
535990,5,6302985285,"Lightweight movie with soon to be super stars in it..Debbie Reynolds and Bob Fosse.  Seeing Fosse and Bobby Van (Dobie) doing their dance numbers is worth the price by itself.  Then there is Debbie, already a pro at nineteen, maybe?  Cute little flick.  Later a TV series withj Maynard added.",1358726400,,292,4.78
7834807,4,6302985285,"If you remember ""The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis"" (1959 TV series) [1959-1963], you're are about to be disappointed as the movie ""The Affairs of Dobie Gillis"" (1953) as even though it is played by popular actors of the day, the story is week and the acting is too tongue in cheek.

Dobie (Bobby Van) and buddy are going to collage to party and have fun, as that is what collage is for. However Dobie falls in love with the studious Pansy (Debbie Reynolds) who is there to work, work, work and study, study, study.

Will Dobie learn to work, work, work? On the other hand, will Pansy learn to play, play, and play?",1508112000,,612,4.359649122807017
