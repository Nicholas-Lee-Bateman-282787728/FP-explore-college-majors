3565958,3,B001F7Q4KC,I expected more of a workout video.  There was too much talking.  I probably won't even use it again.  It's ok.,1360454400,3,111,4.190476190476191
3565959,5,B001F7Q4KC,"I took the first DVD out on loan from the Library and fell in love.  I am 53 years old and am looking for a safe, gentle approach to keeping fit.  I love ther blend of Qi Gong, Yoga , Dance and Pilates.  Jennifer Kries is an excellent instructor who explains the why and how behind the moves, so your form is perfect. I never get board and the DVD package of 4 continues to give you challenges and you become stronger, more flexible, and build up your balance.  I highly recommend this!",1357948800,8,486,4.193548387096774
3565960,4,B001F7Q4KC,"good stuff. good deal. take it easy on the yoga and pilates. listen to your body so you don't hurt yourself. Also, the first dvd is missing the sitting energizer workout that was part of the library version of this dvd.",1348358400,,219,4.365853658536586
3565961,3,B001F7Q4KC,"I haven't gone trough the program yet, however, I only guess as to the reviews here already that the material presented is very well thought out and fun to engage in.  I am only reviewing the type of video used on the DVD. I am using a Dell Inspiron 9300 laptop with 17 inch screen and NVDIA G-Force 6800 graphics card.

I was expecting since it's 2012 that this would be a really well filmed high resolution video like many DVDs you would get from the movie industry, but unfortunately this is not the case. In order to see what's happening on the video I had to make it double size. It's impossible to see otherwise from 10 feet away where i do my workout, squinting eyes is not good for yoga.

Some information on the video quality and resolution I took from VLC media player:
Codec: MPEG-1/2 Video (mpgv)
Resolution: 720x480
Frame rate: 59.940059

The audio is not true CD quality mp3 audio.
Codec: A52 Audio (aka AC3) (a52 )
Channels: 2F1R/LFE
Sample rate: 48000 Hz
Bitrate: 192 kb/s

I guess this is why the price was so affordable with a lot of information, there are costs involved.",1347321600,,1090,4.457286432160804
3565962,5,B001F7Q4KC,"I really like Jennifer Kries, having done yoga to one of her videos for a long time. This box set contains a comprehensive fitness course which goes well beyond physical fitness into emotional, mental and spiritual fitness as well. Jennifer really knows her stuff and it shows in these DVD's, the exercises and the structure is very comprehensive, easy to get into, with disc 1 being a beginner level and disc 4 being advanced. Each one features similar programmes with variations, however it's hard to imagine getting bored. I really enjoy Jennifer's application of yin yoga and meditation. Highly recommended and enjoyable.",1336262400,5,625,5.137254901960785
3565963,5,B001F7Q4KC,"Great product!  I was fortunate to find four of Jennifer Kries' workouts together.  Ordering, shipment, and receipt of my product arrived in a timely manner.",1250726400,2,157,5.24
3565964,5,B001F7Q4KC,"I find Jennifer to be one of the best Pilates instructors on DVD.  I've followed her since the Method and I basically love her instructional style and her soothing voice.  Her information is much appreciated and her outlook towards Eastern philosophy is inspiring.  What a value, 4 of her DVDs chock full of information and a real physical and mental treat.  Do your body good!!!",1242691200,13,379,4.7846153846153845
8301212,1,B001F7Q4KC,"So upset with this purchase, an expensive mistake.

First, the very first disc I tried is defective and missing a segment.
Next, JK talks way too much.  I get that you need to understand the fundamentals.  She also wants to explain theories on the energy of movements.  All of that should be done in an intro, so that when one gets to the workout, it's just the workout, with form reminders as positions are being executed.
Last, many of the 5 star reviews appear to be fake.

I've enjoyed other DVDs by JK, but this was awful.",1525046400,,527,4.391752577319588
8301213,3,B001F7Q4KC,Too many explanations.  I would really like the option on exercise tapes to have a set with explanation and another set that goes straight through.  I really like her other one called 'the method' better than this one.,1520553600,,218,4.7105263157894735
8301214,5,B001F7Q4KC,"Hands down, one of the best designed DVD I have seen. Contains a wide variety of workouts that can be done in any order you choose. You are professionally guided by Jennifer in a way that is easy to follow and enjoyable to do. When I can't get to the gym or to a Pilates/dance class, Hot Body Cool Mind will be my go to.",1427673600,,320,3.9384615384615387
8301215,2,B001F7Q4KC,"I cannot believe that anyone who does workout videos regularly gave this series a high rating.  This had the potential for excellence, and was absolutely ruined by Jennifer's constant interruptions and talking.  What is the point of having a multi-level set if you are going to assume everyone is an absolute beginner and completely unfamiliar with all the exercises, even in the third and fourth levels?!  I gave it two stars because the exercises and routines are very good, and demonstrated with excellent form.  But the non-stop patter made it unwatchable for me.  This should have been my holy grail workout set because I'm a Jennifer Kries fan, love yoga, wellness, Pilates and fitness.  Instead its just a huge disappointment. Trying to get a good workout with these DVDs is incredibly frustrating.  Although the routines are good, she is always stopping and starting,  disrupting the build-up of heat and flow, interjecting  cerebral commentary at points in the workout where you really want to be in your body and focused on the experience.  Workout DVDs should be made to be done over and over, but I could barely get through this once. Its like getting half the workout in twice the time.  Im really bummed because it would have been awesome, if she had just DONE the routines instead of yammering through the series.  Huge let down.",1427328000,4,1344,4.898230088495575
8301216,2,B001F7Q4KC,"I bought this set after trying Level 1, which I love. Since I have been using Jennifer Kries workout videos for years. I was extremely disappointed with what I received from Amazon. The product is not from Razor Entertainment as it says in the product description: It is from some company called True Mind Media. The video quality is poor and one of the workout segments, Waking Energy Sitting, is not on the videos. Also absent is the handy Navigation guide. I feel duped. This product is misrepresented. I am wondering if this is a bootlegged copy. Shame on you Amazon!",1412812800,8,571,4.663366336633663
8301217,1,B001F7Q4KC,"Weird.  Just too tree-hugger, earth energy for me.
Great stretches though.
Consider using mute button if you don't like yoga-weird stuff.",1409443200,,137,5.523809523809524
8301218,5,B001F7Q4KC,Have the Perfect Mix and Precision DVD's alrady and love them as well as just getting the Pilates III.  This is a great mix as well that I will be using on a daily basis.,1405036800,,170,3.857142857142857
8301219,5,B001F7Q4KC,"Like many other reviewers, I've been a follower of Jennifer Kries since her Method videos.

I had gotten my husband to try yoga, but we started with some other instructor DVDs, and I noticed that the instructor didn't really explain correct form and often went too fast. I remembered Jennifer, the one who really taught me the correct form for most poses. Unfortunately most of my Method collection was on VCR in storage, so I went hunting for some of her videos on DVD when I found this boxed set.

This set is great! It really is all her best workouts on each DVD, with each DVD progressing in difficulty. I didn't realize how much I really missed her dance and jazz workouts, and I love that she now has Tai Chi workouts as well.

I think that this collection is so diversified, there is something everyone can fall in love with. Also, I really have never found a better instructor on DVD or in any yoga class I've taken than Jennifer.",1380499200,5,938,4.441860465116279
8301220,5,B001F7Q4KC,I am a big fan of Jennifer Kries. This set has so many levels and different workouts I never get tired of them. The Waking Energy is my favorite to start my day. It really does wake you up and get you energized.,1371859200,2,211,3.9302325581395348
8301221,5,B001F7Q4KC,"Love the workout, but can't find the navigator it keeps taking about.  I'am not very good at the jass and ballet parts.",1367539200,2,119,4.409090909090909
