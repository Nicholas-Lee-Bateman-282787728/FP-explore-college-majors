4911222,4,B005ZOFJNE,"This biography of Dzoghen, the father of Japanese Zen Buddhism is clearly based on fact and is a good way to learn about the origins of Zen.  But, beyond that, it is a darn good story told by a well made movie.  I recommend this to anybody interested in Zen or religions of the world.",1353542400,9,284,4.1454545454545455
4911223,5,B005ZOFJNE,"We showed this movie at a Buddhist gathering in our town.  The story line, acting, and cinematography were excellent.  Putting Dogen in the cultural context of his time made his teachings even more exceptional.",1347840000,,210,5.147058823529412
4911224,5,B005ZOFJNE,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Never has the topic of enlightenment been captured so eloquently and symbolically. A great full moon shines brightly upon every element of this picture: scenery, performances, costuming, and story. It captures Zen in its infancy, its growning pains, and its lasting legacy. It gives you an insight into the stillness and silence of Zen practice. It's inspiring and full of wisdom. Multiple viewings are definitely recommended. The DVD includes a featurette, which is also beautiful and gives further insight into Dogen and Zen.",1331769600,59,560,5.523255813953488
4911225,5,B005ZOFJNE,"I had the opportunity to watch this movie. This is a really great movie, whether or not you are interested in zen studies.
I do not understand why it has not been yet distributed in Europe, or sold under zone 2 format.",1330041600,5,218,4.214285714285714
4911226,5,B005ZOFJNE,Prepare to be immersed in the now - in the active world of monks seeking answers and men and women living in dispair and confusion.  The dharma and the value of just sitting will be revealed - directly and from beautiful actors in images of high production value.  A well made film. Could you be a Zen monk? Can Zen insight be about how to live in this world as a man or a woman? Eyes horizontal and nose vertical.,1329868800,32,414,4.1625
4911227,2,B005ZOFJNE,"I did not particularly care for it, difficult to follow.",1441929600,,56,4.7
4911228,3,B005ZOFJNE,"Interesting in terms of information and circumstances of life of Buddha Dogen, but very poor in the performances as well as the screenplay.  The whole movie is  monotonus and tends to be boring at times.",1440720000,,203,4.771428571428571
4911229,5,B005ZOFJNE,"Contrary to my expectations, this is an often very moving account of Zen Master Eihei Dogen's life and practice of the Buddha Way. It is true to historical evidence and accounts of the period (13th-century feudal China and Japan) as well as to biographical and autobiographical information about Master Dogen. The film is well conceived, beautifully and movingly acted, and generally understated. For me, the one glaring exception to the film's understatement is the brief scene supposedly depicting Dogen's experience of awakening under the Chinese Master T'ien-t'ung Ju-ching (pron. Tyen-toong Roo-jing). The scene is hokey beyond words and really quite unnecessary, especially in light of Ju-ching's teaching of realization as the ""casting off of the body and mind of self and others."" It's really hard to fathom why a knowledgeable film director would indulge in such a Disney-like scene. Still, there are many scenes which ring true to the record and to the boundless and truly inspiring spirit of Zen Master Dogen.

4911230,2,B005ZOFJNE,"I was looking forward to seeing this and by the end, thought it was bazaar. Inappropriate sex scenes that have nothing to do with Zen or Dogen. Also awful scenes of heads displayed from war.  So out of place for a story about Dogen.  Thumbs down.",1425772800,,246,4.326086956521739
4911231,5,B005ZOFJNE,One of my very favourite Buddhist films of all time with brilliant acting and moving story line.,1424649600,,96,4.705882352941177
4911232,1,B005ZOFJNE,"This was a real disappointment.  It is a drama about the guy Dogen who brought reformed or authentic zen to Japan from China (He was Japanese, went to China, studied a lot, then came back).  The drama has actors with about the level of highschool acting ability.  The production levels are very low.  Ultimately with these low values it became very boring and not worth watching.  A 10 year old might like it.",1413676800,5,409,4.5479452054794525
4911233,5,B005ZOFJNE,"An introduction to the simplicity and yet difficulty of Zen.  A good story, and well filmed.",1408147200,,92,4.75
4911234,5,B005ZOFJNE,"This movie is great, especially for those interested in Soto Zen. The acting is way better than I expected. The story provides a wonderful visual interpretation of an important moment in the history of Zen Buddhism.",1403827200,,215,5.0
4911235,1,B005ZOFJNE,"I was hoping for something a lot more informative and entertaining.  If you are gifted with god-like patience and perseverance, you might find something of value in this film, though you'd likely be better off simply meditating for 30 minutes.",1402876800,5,243,5.075
4911236,5,B005ZOFJNE,"I wanted to know what Zen Buddhism was based on and the movie gave so much more about the culture of the time and the clothing, life styles, and tragedies of those times in China and Japan",1400630400,,188,4.108108108108108
4911237,5,B005ZOFJNE,"I enjoyed ""Zen"". I felt that the movie delved deeply into subtle levels of human behaviour in society and life circumstances which can be so challenging to move out of. I admired the manner in which the female leading actress was portrayed and her transformation when eventually realising her own Buddha nature which actually progressed through the entire movie and wasn't an overnight unrealistic  transformation. Kantarou Nakamura played the lead brilliantly with sensitivity and strength. Overall the movie was believable, understandable and carried a strong content.",1399334400,,570,5.627906976744186
4911238,5,B005ZOFJNE,The best movie on Japanese Buddhism and the teaching of Zen by Dgen Zenji. One of the most powerful movies ever.,1398643200,,112,4.380952380952381
4911239,5,B005ZOFJNE,"The real life story of Zen Master Dogen and the transmission of his teachings of the true dharma to his disciples. A beautiful film for all who practice zazen. The Way is that of simplicity, emptiness and seeing things as they truly are. ""Eyes Horizontal, Nose Vertical."" The first film I've been able to sit all the way through with a smile on my face from start to finish without being distracted, while playing my Guild Acoustic Guitar as a Japanese Koto over this lush and beautiful soundtrack. I have studied Zen and Taoism most of my life, and it is quite rare and wonderous for this beautiful spiritual practice to be depicted on film. Thank you for this. A Must-See.",1392681600,5,674,4.578512396694215
4911240,5,B005ZOFJNE,"I was very much  appreciative of the work of the filmmakers in presenting a reverential biography of Dogen that focuses on the founding of the Soto school of Zen in Japan. I was most struck by its allegorical and metaphorical nature. Though some have seen little or no value in the Orin subplot, it seems to me a largely parallel story to that of Jesus' ministry and the conversion (at least in terms of church history which was apparently mistaken) of Mary Magdalene who was styled as a prostitute but ultimately became very important in the founding of Christianity. The truth of the film lies in the struggle of faith against adversity and the elevation of the purity of the basic tenets of Zen,  meditation--in Dogen's case, shikantaza, as inseparable from enlightenment, the awakening to the Original Self and the falling away of the illusive structures of mind. The shadow of the Jesus story reinforces the universal longing for, and attainability of, redemption.

The cinematography is beautifully done, with images of landscape, sky, moon, water and other symbols that serve to underscore the teachings of Dogen and serve as metaphors. The acting is heartfelt and reverential. As with most films of Jesus, Dogen is portrayed as a dauntless leader who perseveres and is loved by his followers who, in this film, give a number of strong performances. Dogen, himself, is played by a kabuki actor who handles the role with great care and investment.

Any telling of a man's story, his accomplishments, his process, is an allegory of the abstract notion of the human condition. This film points the finger at Zen and it's place in the experience of each individual, and it persuades us to forget the finger and just do the sitting. I feel refreshed by the honesty of it, and I would highly recommend this film .",1391472000,,1814,4.841935483870968
4911241,5,B005ZOFJNE,"I would highly recommend this movie.  I have learned a lot from it.  I remember when my legs fall asleep in meditation the part where Dogen's master says something along the lines of, even if your bottom is rotting, you sit!  makes my numb legs pale in comparison.  It is a very beautiful movie in several different senses of the meaning.",1387324800,,338,4.491803278688525
4911242,5,B005ZOFJNE,The must have for Zen students. Direct and to the point of what Zen practice is about. Gives a good flavor of what Dogen was about and his Zen practice.,1379894400,,152,4.1
4911243,5,B005ZOFJNE,"the true story of Buddhism is very rare to see now a day! so the environment and decor of the film is very good, the narration is intelligent and impressive.",1378857600,,157,4.266666666666667
4911244,5,B005ZOFJNE,"As a follower of Dogen, via Suzuki Roshi and many others, I found this film, can I say, enlightening................thoughtful, informative, enjoyable.",1374537600,2,151,6.238095238095238
4911245,4,B005ZOFJNE,"This was quite good and has high production values... except for the special effects in some scenes supposedly depicting spiritual experiences. Those scenes were a problem for me, not so much because of the almost laughable special effects, but because of the way they were attempting to depict such experiences. There are various other visual metaphors which would have been greatly preferable. Other than that, it was well done and well acted, and I'm glad I got it.",1372032000,,468,5.012820512820513
4911246,5,B005ZOFJNE,"'Zen' has become something of generic catchword for a fluffy, sentimental greeting card type of spirituality.  This is the true story of one of the greatest teachers in this rich tradition, Ehei Dogen, his quest in China for a dharma teacher, and how he brought the authentic Chinese tradition of Chan Buddhism home to Japan.  Beautifully filmed with no false steps.",1369180800,6,366,4.983606557377049
4911247,5,B005ZOFJNE,"Portrays the Tendai priest who considered that his sect had gotten away from its founder's intentions of quiet contemplation, and instead developed into a worldly (with an army of guards for protection) practice full of ritual with many practitioners not really sincere.  He went to China as had most priests searching for Dharma instruction and found a practice which he developed into one of simple meditation and contemplation.  He is considered one of the great Buddhist philosophers of Japan.  I am not an historian, and am not sure of the details, but for someone who is interested in foundations of Japanese culture or particularly in Buddhism, I would recommend this movie as an enjoyable way to get an historical introduction.  It will not teach anyone how to practice, but it does present history and some of the spirituality.",1364083200,19,836,5.036231884057971
4911248,5,B005ZOFJNE,Although it is impossible to describe Zen in words or pictures it was fun to imagine what Dogen's life and experiences might have been like.  The cinematography is excellent.  I could have done without the interviews.,1362528000,2,217,5.0
4911249,5,B005ZOFJNE,"This is a very long and one of those movies that once you start you can't stop watching. And I will e watching it several times I am sure. The lessons entrenched in this are valuable, interesting and informative. Congratulations to the Directors, and Actors what an amazing story. Highly recommend to all that are seeking information on Buddhism and enlightenment.",1361059200,2,364,4.983606557377049
4911250,4,B005ZOFJNE,"A beautiful and inspirational film for those (like myself) who are relatively new to buddhist zen practice and thought. The film is a celebration of the long lineage of teachers and practitioners of sitting meditation (zazen) as a path to the relief of suffering for all beings (""To study the self is to forget the self""). The film focuses on the life of Dogen, a 13th century monk whose search for authentic zen teachings and practice moves him to bring the practice of sitting meditation to all people. The fundamental elements of zen buddhism teachings....that the essence of enlightenment is accepting what is rather than grasping for what we want or pushing away what we don't want... is beautifully illustrated in this film. Even a cursory reading about Dogen via Wikipedia or some similar source will enhance the meaning of the movie by giving the events portrayed some historic context.",1359244800,11,894,4.966666666666667
4911251,5,B005ZOFJNE,"This movie is about Dougen, who travels to China and brings Zen Buddhism back to Japan in 1227. The movie is in Japanese with English subtitles. If you have one spiritual bone in your body, you must see this movie. These types of movies are few and far between. Kantaro Nakamura is great Kabuki actor and doesn't disappoint in this movie. This is a movie that could change your life.",1357862400,2,383,4.485714285714286
4911252,4,B005ZOFJNE,"The sub-plot with Orin has no relevance to a straight biography of Dogen.

Kisa Gotami (Orin) was a woman in the life of the historic Buddha.
She could not accept the death of her baby.
As a reality check, the Buddha sent her to find a household not touched by death; there was none.

This device equates Dogen with the Buddha (even though we all may be the Buddha.)

Of course, it is impossible to produce an accurate history of a figure who lived more than 800 years ago.
But shouldn't there be a disclaimer?

The danger here is to create a cult figure out of Dogen.

This movie is not a mere biography of Dogen; it is a spiritual metaphor.",1356825600,6,642,4.2727272727272725
4911253,5,B005ZOFJNE,This movie is well done.  I really enjoyed the thoughtful way it was made.  The acting is good and the story of Eihei Dogen is one that can be watched over and over again and enjoyed each time.  This movie is one that you will want to share with others after you enjoy it yourself.  A very positive and enjoyable movie!  Don't miss it.,1356393600,,335,4.171875
4911254,5,B005ZOFJNE,"Splendid way of recalling important issues from the mist of memories.
Simplicity of the message combined with the beauty of the art of film making.
Once again -  a number of lessons for the modern times from the ancient past.
Maybe this time will last longer and make life easier and full of joy.
Experience is personal. One cannot pass it over.

8489869,5,B005ZOFJNE,"Although this DVD is in Japanese and Chinese, I still give it five stars.  It also is on youtube with English sub-titles, so that is how I was able to watch and understand it.  For anyone wishing to know more about the history of Soto Zen Buddhism, see this movie.  Although there was some artistic liberty taken in the story line, that's fine.  It makes my heart glad to know that someone such as Dogen Zenji walked the earth, however so long ago, as did the Buddha himself.  Dogen Zenji was a highly gifted intellectual, disciplined, well studied in Chan Buddhism; his valuable contributions to Zen Buddhism thrives today.  I now have more understanding of the ancient beginnings, and the especially exquisite nature, of Soto Zen as a practice and as a way of life.  To all who helped create this movie, and a special thank-you to the outstanding and gifted actor who portrayed Master Dogen---Well done, well done!",1503705600,,916,4.723270440251572
8489870,1,B005ZOFJNE,"Showed up as a blank CD. Originally tried playing it on Xbox 360 and PS4, both didn't work. When putting it into my computer, there was only ""AUDIO_TS"" and ""VIDEO_TS"" files on the disk, both empty.

I was really excited to learn about Dogen through video format, but now I have to throw away a useless product that I paid for. I'd appreciate if I received some feedback or if there's some secret way to populate these files.

In a way, it was a great meditative practice on emptiness, but I'd prefer to get some money or time back.",1491868800,,531,4.353535353535354

8489874,5,B005ZOFJNE,"A well made film about Dogen Zenji, the man who brought Zen Buddhism from China to Japan. As a Zen practitioner, I find this film to be inspiring and motivational. I think anyone with serious religious or spiritual aspirations would find this film moving. Those without Zen understanding and Japanese cultural understanding may not understand what sometimes seems like Dogen's lack of compassion - which, would actually be far from the truth.",1465257600,,442,5.152777777777778
