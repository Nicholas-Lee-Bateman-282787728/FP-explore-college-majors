8259747,4,B0015RRNG6,"""August the First"" was selected by Film Movement as a selection from its participation in the Milwaukee Film Festival.  Lanre Olabisi's first film is an excellent drama.  The cameras are frequently hand-held with frequent shifts from the many family and friends who have come to see Tunde's high school graduation.  Ian Alsup plays Tunde, filled with hopes and dreams, but not seeing family relationships clearly.  Appreciation of the film hinges on several reversals; so I will try not to spoil those.  Joy Merriweather plays the mother Rhonda who tries to drown her problems in a wine glass.  As the film progresses, she becomes increasingly under the influence which adds to the volatility and pathos.  Tunde's sister Simisola is played by Kerisse Hutchinson who brings her husband and has mysterious bouts of nausea without the aid of alcohol.  Tunde's brother Ade is played well by Sean Phillips.  Ade lives in the house and has served as surrogate father in the decade since their father left them and established another family in Nigeria.  D. Rubin Green, in a brilliant performance, plays the father Dipo who tries to ingratiate himself back into the family where he previously burned bridges.  Gloria Sauve plays the saucy grandmother who lets Dipo know where he stands with her.  Monique Gramby plays Janine who is a calming influence on the family.  Events spiral nicely in this compact drama until the final frames where Olabisi subtly lets us view the whole rest of the film with a different perspective.  ""August the First"" is full of fresh faces who do excellent work.  This is one of the few independent features from the USA Film Movement has distributed and is well worth viewing.

The film short is from Canada about a woman from Malta who crosses Canada on stilts.  It is a good example of non-realistic cinema, even if the conclusion is a bit open-ended, subject to interpretation.  This is a strong DVD package!  Enjoy!",1221004800,6,1942,4.938271604938271
