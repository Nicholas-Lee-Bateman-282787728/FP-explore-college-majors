Dreams Come True (DCT) know how to put on a show...
My computer was already set to Region 2 and played this concert DVD well.

This was a big J-Pop concert performed when the band was a trio (Singer Miwa Yoshida, Guitar Player Masato Nakamura, and Keyboard Player Takahiro Nishikawa). For the recent concerts, it has been Miwa and Masato.

Because it is one the ""Wonderland"" shows, there were crazy outfits, along with singing and dancing. There was even a rotating stage.
This concert was bigger than usual and was outside for many fans to see.

All of the songs in concert were in Japanese.
Miwa and backup singer, Rin, sing a tune from their side project, ""Funk the Peanuts.""

My objection is the Region 2 coding.
This DVD is an older release.
Fans of DCT with American DVD players (Region 1) will probably shop for something like ""Wonderland 1999 Fuyu no Yume"" (winter concert) or ""Ura Dori Wonderland 2012/2013"" or a new single release with music videos.

*Many of their more recent Concerts and singles are usually Region Free*

I only had the Chance to see ""ATTACK 25"" concert LIVE in Shizuoka, Japan... but they were one the best I've seen.",1433289600,,1159,4.6568627450980395
