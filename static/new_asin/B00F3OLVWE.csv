5966740,5,B00F3OLVWE,"This is a far above average horror thriller with shades of Scream and Halloween and perhaps Wait until Dark.  Coet and Kelly are superb as a daughter and father who are terrorized in their huge house on a night of what should have been just pranks.  And...she is blind, psychosomatically, which adds to the suspense.  Good stuff!",1388707200,,329,4.7368421052631575

5966742,2,B00F3OLVWE,"This is the blind person terrorized by an intruder film. There has been nearly a dozen of these made and I thought this was one of the worse. Emily Walton (Noell Coet) who is psychologically blind from an automobile accident where her mother (Shannon Makhanian) died, must defend herself against an intruder on mischief night.

There were only three characters introduced besides Emily. Two of them are victims and the third is doubtful, leaving you with a senseless meaningless film that is simply a break-in for the sake of a break-in. No twist.

Emily is blind, but watches TV and turns the lights on. Had the feel of a made for TV drama. I didn't feel the intensity or horror.

5966744,4,B00F3OLVWE,"Mischief Night is a good little thriller that plays out more like an R rated lifetime made for TV movie. The acting was above par and there were some chilling moments courtesy of a home invader in a raincoat and an effectively creepy mask,it has clever camera angles and great production value!

The story was simple enough and adhered to most of the slasher cliche`s. In the beginning we are introduced to a couple (Charlie O`Connell) and (Erica Leehrson) Leerhson who is no stranger to the genre, being in such movies as Wrong Turn 2,The  Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and The Blair Witch Project 2 Gave it some horror cred. We watch as they try and fend off the attacker who writes Boo In blood before he attacks. After having his way with them the film cuts to ( Noel Coet`s) character Emily in her shrinks office where they are talking about the reason she is blind and how her sight could return at anytime.

Emily`s dad played by (Daniel Hugh Kelly)is going on a date leaving Emily alone on Mischief night which is the night before Halloween and this is when the cat and mouse games begin during which Emily`s boyfriend and Aunt stop in with some dire consequences.

The killer s effectively creepy and since he can see that Emily is blind he decades to  taunts her more than his usual victims.it`s an entertaining film that I would call slasher light because there are a few bloody moments but not enough to make it hard core.its definitely worth a rent. It was somewhat reminiscent of (Eyes of a Stranger)an 80`s slasher starring Lauren Tewes and Jennifer Jason Leigh.",1383350400,8,1578,4.621428571428571
5966745,4,B00F3OLVWE,"It's not often, but once in a blue moon, there comes along a film that delivers.  I've always been open to the possibility that a little unknown movie (to me anyway) would exceed my expectations - Mischief Night did just that.  Although there were one or two holes in the plot, for the most part, it was a good story and I thought the actors acted and reacted well.  There were 3 or 4 ""jump out of your seat"" moments that really got me good & I so do love it when that happens!  Only one or two brief periods that seemed to run on a bit longer than I preferred, just briefly and not enough to repel me.  A good family horror flick I think but enjoyable and entertaining for us ol' folk too.  Job Well Done.  Soft 4 stars, not a waste of time or money.....yea!",1383350400,8,759,4.087837837837838
5966746,5,B00F3OLVWE,"I just watched Mischief Night.  It was an edge-of-your-seat spellbinding movie. Their is not a single dull moment in this story of a terrifying home invasion the night before Halloween.

Noell Coet should get awards, to include an academy award nod for her spectacular starring role as a blind Emily Walton in this great horror/thriller movie. Likewise, Daniel Hugh Kelly gave a brilliant and powerful performance as young Emily's (Noell Coet) father. Frankly, the entire cast in this movie was terrific. Their wasn't a single weak performance by anyone in this movie. They were all stellar performances. Without doubt this is an very well acted movie.

Mischief Night puts a new bent on an old school type of horror picture that brings this genre in to the very best of present day horror/thriller types of flicks. Frankly, it is a unique horror/thriller picture for this very reason. Modern day ""old school."" There is nothing quite like it anywhere. That's what makes this movie so captivating and why the screen play writers and director also deserve accolades.

Put Mischief Night down in your ""must see"" movie list. You really don't want to miss this one. It could become a cult classic.",1383264000,5,1192,4.945
5966747,2,B00F3OLVWE,"Just... okay. Nice unique concept. For a B rated movie I think the quality is above average. It's just that it's not enough. I became super, super bored in the middle. The acting is above average for the lead, and below average for the killer. His facial expressions are weird, very weird in certain scenes. I think he's trying to be scary with the monotone and it just doesn't work... so it just ends up being weird. As you can see, the weirdness vibe is strong, and it doesn't work with the story line, since he's supposed to be menacing. Idk. She seems weird, which is purposeful with the story line, but the script tries to hard so it comes off corny. The idea that a killer would frolic around town executing elementary school pranks? Just... no. The females look WAY too old to be playing high schoolers/teenagers, so they should have made them college students. The special effects/makeup are below average, even for B rated films, particularly the evisceration effect.

I was super disappointed. But I hope the filmmakers keep trying. Hire a new lead male though.",1445472000,,1071,4.696808510638298
5966748,5,B00F3OLVWE,"Each year on 'Mischief Night', a masked killer strikes.  The house where he targeted his victims last year is now under new ownership, the new inhabitants, a single father and his blind teenage daughter, blissfully unaware of the history of their house.  (It appears that the killer has taken bodies or any other evidence with him at the end of each killing night, and has varied his modus operandi over the years enough that both the police and the general public don't yet realize there's a serial killer on the prowl.)

This year when he makes his appearance at the somewhat secluded house, the killer is surprised to find that the only one home is a blind girl (Em, played by Noel Collet).  Apparently feeling that this presents all kinds of opportunities for cat-and-mouse, he doesn't strike immediately, but stalks and watches Em, who gradually begins to become aware of his presence.

One admitted flaw is that a couple of scenes aren't necessarily the most realistic.  On the plus side though, we have a cool new twist on a classic scenario, high rate performances and production values, great tension and suspense throughout, and good detailed characterization.  Some have felt that the movie took too long setting up and establishing the different characters.  I don't agree with that myself; for one thing having a smaller cast just calls for more detail payed to the players you do have; for another thing it establishes a situation where you're really rooting for the potential victims.  The masked killer is also a well made character, although one initially knows nothing whatsoever about his motivation or background.  He's apparently a highly intelligent individual who kills for thrills rather than revenge or other considerations.  Actually, in places he's reminiscent of Chromeskull from the Laid To Rest movies.

And in the end the movie actually is even greater than the sum of its parts, a hidden gem.  Anyone even vaguely interested in horror movies or suspenseful thrillers should pick this one up as soon as possible.",1435104000,2,2043,4.991150442477876

It definitely is trying to be both a parody and a straight drama at the same time.

5966756,3,B00F3OLVWE,"Admittedly, I was very close to giving this movie 2 stars. It's getting a 3 star though because Malcom McDowell appeared for 10 minutes as the neighborhood watch guy. That was the only highlight of this movie. It started off creepy with some potential, but seemed to take a turn for the worse when the ""prospective"" killer came into the picture. Then the film took on a kind of a sappy romantic comedy / drama feel. I liked the ending and not just because I was ready for it to be over, but because that's finally when it became what a horror movie is all about. All in all, just meh.",1414368000,,584,4.27027027027027
5966757,1,B00F3OLVWE,"I usually steer away from these horror film collections like ""An After Dark Original"" and ""Masters of Horror,"" but after checking out the trailer for this flick I thought I'd give it a try.

SPOILERS BELOW

While the film started off promising, with the secluded babysitter in the mountains without cell phone reception and a creepy masked killer stalking her, it quickly changed tone. The filmmakers decided to make this final girl different from the others, with her history of self-abuse seemingly making her a willing victim, much to the confusion of the masked killer. The film then shifts from the classic slasher format to one that takes on the feel of a romantic comedy like ""Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist."" An interesting premise, but far too much of the film is devoted to exploring this light and carefree interlude before the last five minutes return to its advertised horror roots, leaving the viewer with a ""What the hell did I just watch?"" kind of feeling.

Malcolm McDowell is touted as being in the film, and he is, but I've seen commercials on YouTube videos that are longer than his screentime. The film is definitely promoted as a horror/slasher film, but it really isn't. The comments on the back of the DVD cover are understandably vague and the way the film is promoted easily lure horror fans in.

In short, do your research on this one before you commit to watching it. There are a few cool parts and it might work for some, but it left a weird taste in my mouth.",1413849600,,1491,4.657794676806084

The movie itself was really odd. I'm all for movies going a different route but the character's actions really never make much sense. Maybe with a better lead actress that could actually sell this character. But Brooke Anne Smith was awful.

Drags a tiny bit in the middle during some long conversations, but the bursts of action and scares keep the tempo mostly tight, and the two leads are terrific, especially Brooke Anne Smith.  Her performance keeps you mesmerized through this rollercoaster ride of a film.  If you're looking for something different and good in a horror movie, give Mischief Night a try.",1409529600,2,502,4.813953488372093
5966770,4,B00F3OLVWE,I found this one very good and interesting enough to keep my attention the whole time with enough twits to make it worthwhile. I liked it.,1409443200,3,138,4.346153846153846
5966771,4,B00F3OLVWE,"Mischief Night could almost be forgiven for being better than the cover or the first 5 minutes would lead one to believe. What is actually presented is a fairly well-acted, small, isolation-filled thriller. Making the home invasion genre a little less clichd, Mischief Night involves a girl who is hysterically blind being stalked by a masked killer.

The violence was very understated and I was not entirely certain why they rated it ""R"", but despite this I enjoyed it. Noell Coet channels her best nice girl/vanessa hudgens impersonation to deliver a fairly believable performance as the traumatized young Emily. The movie clocks in at just over 1 hour 20 minutes and is the perfect length to never feel like it was dragging.

As I mentioned above, the beginning of the movie is more of your traditional horror film variety, only they chose to use Charlie O'Connell (Sliders) and Erica Leershen (Blair Witch 2) as the beginning slasher fodder. Whereas with Scream this did a great job of setting up the plot, here it really made me question my purchase and cost of my precious time for a bad movie. Fortunately, it did not derail what was overall a fun little flick.

Ultimately this comes down to taste and I happen to like home invasion movies, as well as the films where the heroine has to try and overcome their personal damage to save the day. It kept me guessing for a while and even though I kind of figured out the ending, I applaud the information that the director chose to withhold from the audience. This is worth at least a rental and as cheap as it is I am glad to have it in the collection.",1407715200,,1607,4.592334494773519

5966784,4,B00F3OLVWE,"So this film wasn't exactly typecast as a specifically created genre type film. Good for them. It wasn't magic, but her sensuality was captivating. The director got that on film. She's model beautiful, but that's never enough. Whether it was her and we have a new star on our hands or the direction was what made her captivating, the point I'm trying to make is that with all the scripts out there trying to make money instead of concentrating of filmmaking, even if this was really the beautiful psychopath-centric plot, it at least tried to get something right. And it did do that. I would have written more David Lynch into it, but I would be up against the money suckers telling me to tone down the artistic attempts. So, the whole film just squeezed by with a lot of potential lost, but with some success, namely, Brooke Anne Smith. Heck, at least she was watchable which is better than most crap out there created by the money makers which most often won't let anything great happen. I gave it 4 stars because I wanted to watch Brooke Anne Smith and that's more than what most films have made me want to do. Film should be art and art is partly about aesthetics, so she brought that to the screen. Ya, ya... I know films are meant to be more, but at least she carried the film. Sad to have to settle for that. Throughout film history MOST films have been crap. It will always be a rare moment when a great film is made and many years can go by before that's accomplished. To get a scrap of decency is often what being a regular film viewer is all about. And that's what we got here.

That was quickly dispelled and I realized it was going to be more of a ""Heathers"" like experience. For those who weren't around then, Heathers was a black humoresque flick, in the 80s, that became an instant cult classic. Black humor, macabre humor, meant something different back then. More like ironic and twisted/perverse than shets and giggles. I'm not saying the plot or style of the film is anything like Heathers. The experience brought it to mind. That is all. The acting and camera work were fine in this flick. Technically, it was sound. I knew what was coming down the pike by the early middle but it was still entertaining. At first, I was thinking, ""No, please, no, don't go there."" But by the time it did, I felt like it worked. So, there's my 2 cents. Its much better than much of what is available now but it wasn't straight up horror.",1402444800,2,951,4.633136094674557
5966796,3,B00F3OLVWE,"Not to be confused with the other ""Mischief Night,"" which is about a blind girl trapped in her house by a stalker, this movie is about a babysitter who is being stalked. Sounds corny, but it really isn't, as the plot twists make this movie anything but ordinary. Malcolm McDowell makes a few appearances, but is not really in the film all that much. The acting is good, pacing is decent, but this is not a typical horror film. With the exception of a few violent scenes, it certainly is not a ""slasher"" film. Not a bad investment of time, if you are a fan of a psychological thriller/mind games type of movie. Just don't let the skull on the cover be misleading. 3.5 stars.",1401667200,10,673,4.392
5966797,3,B00F3OLVWE,"I liked what the filmmakers were trying to do here.  It did indeed take the babysitter horror genre and turn it upside down.  However, it felt more like a coming of age tale instead of a horror movie.  I suppose that's the element that added to the overall effect of the movie.  I wasn't expecting to story to take the turns that it did and the ending sequence (while not too much of a surprise) was brilliant in it's own right.

The script was fluid and the dialogue intelligent.  There were a few discrepancies but I'll let the next viewer make that determination.  Malcolm McDowell was his usual creepy self.  Fortunately this movie wasn't over-saturated with gore.  The effects were realistic and well-done.  The acting was a little flat in certain spots but it was worth sitting through them just to see what would happen next.

The movie had maybe 15 minutes left and the thought popped in my mind briefly and was quickly ignored because of the events that started to unravel on screen.  I was correct (almost) and let me add that it's just refreshing to have a new story line, new twists and of course, my favorite thing is the ""gotcha"" moment when I'm completely fooled by the writers.

5966801,3,B00F3OLVWE,"Obviously inspired by ""The Purge"" and 1967's ""Wait Until Dark"", ""Mischief Night"" combines a blind girl left alone in a large upper-class house with the not really explained ""Purge""-ish ""Mischief Night""; a sort of pseudo night of freedom for people to do halloweenish things like egging houses and letting out their immature tendencies; I think. Of course, somebody takes it too far and Emily (Noell Coet), the blind girl, ends up fighting for her life against the masked pansy. I mean seriously... a blind girl?! You're out to exercise your mischief night liberties and you have to pick on the poor girl who can't even see!!! This alone makes you anxious to see the assailant get his punk beat down. I was hoping for a weeping like a girly-man scene, but it didn't play out.

Despite the obvious cowardice of the guy on the cover of the movie box, ""Mischief Night"" is actually a pretty good movie. It was better than I thought it would be and I had enough thoughts about it that I felt like writing this review.

Noell Coet is a good actress and actually plays a really good blind girl. She only overplayed it a couple of times. She hasn't been blind her entire life and her navigation of the household that she's become familiar with is believable. I especially liked the moment where she was rattled, started to run and ran hard into a counter. It looked painful and it added to the intensity of the scene. Her emotions throughout the film were spot on and had me feeling her fear.

The movie is also beautifully filmed and capably edited. Mr. Mischief night may have chosen the poor blind girl to pick on so that he could stand around and follow her through her house without her knowing. This is certainly a great gimmick and it is pulled off well., especially when Mr. Mischief Night poses as Emily's boyfriend for a brief moment.

Much was done correctly with ""Mischief Night"" and I found the movie enjoyable for the most part, but the times that it ventures into eye-roll land spoil the party. When Emily finds a chainsaw in the garage attached to a tree-trimmer extender and decides to put it to use, it may have created the most horribly coincidental occurrence in movie cinema history. Fortunately the entire movie wasn't that way. Although the cut she received to her foot when stepping on a broken glass vase would have rendered her a lot less mobile than it did, but I think the creators were more concerned with showing a gnarly-cut in a horror movie than being realistic. Finally, the ending, while not as bad as the chainsaw extender scene, was one more giant eye-roller.

""Mischief Night"" could have been so so so much better had the creators not tried to overdo it. Had they just kept things inside reality or logic, it may have even been a great independent horror movie. As is though, 1967's ""Wait Until Dark"" is a better film because they at least kept things real.

Another ""Mischief Night"" came out in 2014 that looks eerily similar. Apparently they aren't connected, but I find that hard to believe. Mr. Mischief night on both dvd cases even look similar. The theme is similar. Possibly the director and writer of ""Mischief Night"" 2014 was involved in ""MN"" 2013 and didn't like the things that I pointed out. To each his own. ""The Purge"" wasn't that great of a movie, but I guess it does have the possibility of many story lines. Or does it?",1401062400,2,3365,4.6

5966803,4,B00F3OLVWE,"I thought I had seen every babysitter-versus-slasher-flick-idea ever imaginedbut boy, was I wrong!  Just when I think I have a genre solidified, an inventive filmmaker comes along and completely changes the game.  Such is the case with MISCHIEF NIGHT.  Director Travis Baker (no relation) turns the babysitter-versus-slasher concept upside down with this slick fright-fest, and the result is a terrifying trek into the bizarre!

Dont confuse this After Dark Original film with the 2013 movie of the same title.  The two are very different and have nothing to do with one another.  But be sure to check this one out, as it is a very original take on an existing horror sub-genre.

MISCHIEF NIGHT starts out like any other film in this category, with the proverbial babysitter home alone with her charge while the parents are away.  When strange things begin to happen, she reacts as every sitter does:  locking the doors and windows while arming herself.  But this is where the similarities end; the audience quickly realizes this girl is not like others before hernot by a long shot.

The film is made well and looks good onscreen.  The production value seems high, and theres really not a specific area where anything is lacking.  The film overall is solid and moves at a nice pace.

The cast in MISCHIEF NIGHT do a great job with their roles, which is one of the reasons this movie succeeds.  I always enjoy seeing Malcolm McDowell onscreen, and this film is no exception.  To be honest, hes not in the film that much, but enough so to give him due credit.  And I have to commend Brooke Ann Smith with her portrayal of the main character, Kaylie.  I have not seen Smiths work before, but she plays this multilayered character with ease.  I enjoyed her performance and look forward to seeing more of what she can do.

The special effects are pretty good as well, and theres even a nice bit of gore (albeit a small dose).  I would have preferred more carnage from a slasher flick, but what we get to see is nice.  I particularly like the teenage prick that gets disemboweled.  He definitely gets what he deserves, and the effects do the scene justice.

Th story of MISCHIEF NIGHT is what really wins here, though.  I love how this film takes the traditional babysitter slasher and completely changes it up.  I didn't see this twist coming, and it makes for an entertaining thrill ride throughout the film.

MISCHIEF NIGHT is a big win for me, and I recommend giving it a look.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1400630400,8,2528,4.658371040723982

It takes place the night before Halloween ( Mischief Night ), but it feels like it is Halloween during the movie ! With all the great Halloween decor every where. To me that is important atmosphere can really add to a movie, and in this one with the Halloween props, pumpkin, decor.... you do feel like hey this is right around Halloween for sure !!!! It starts out like your typical slasher movie,girl babysitting, crazy killer wearing a mask, after her ,  BUT it takes a turn ! a big turn, and has some GREAT twists !!!! ( TO ME ). I honestly give it 5 stars.  I am a big fan of Malcolm McDowell, but he is only in this a very, short time. Maybe 3 mins tops. Also wanted to add to me the movie has very solid acting in it.

Mischief Night obviously takes place the evening before Halloween and I think this is a draw for most horror fans, especially in the spring/summer months. It's got a nice dose of nostalgia to hold us over until October and bring the flavor of Halloween into Memorial Day Weekend. I know it sounds weird, but Halloween-horror flicks are the embodiement of the Halloween spirit and who doesn't want a little dose of that early?

Travis Baker (writer/director) and Swamp Shark's Richard Tanne (producer) are two very promising up-and-coming talents. They've crafted an original, genre-bending horror-drama here. This is certainly one movie you'll want in your collection.",1399334400,2,917,5.317241379310345
5966808,3,B00F3OLVWE,"Discounting the couple in the opening scene, this 80-some-odd minute movie takes (literally) 40 minutes to really start picking up steam. It's all backstory and character building, but we get it all ready- the main character is blind and insists on being independent. She does a pretty good job of it, too, with some minor struggles. It could have all been conveyed and explained in half the time or less.

But once it gets going (finally), it's pretty good. Some things are bit predictable, but the slasher-stalking-blind-girl twist is something new to me. I didn't know how I'd feel about that, when we, the audience, can SEE the threat but she can't. It worked, in general, and much to my surprise. One part in particular was applause-worthy for shock value and creativity.

The lead in this movie is phenomenal. She exceeded my expectations.

There are the expected blood and violence in this movie, of course, but it's not over-the-top. This one does not try to hide behind shocking violence and excessive gore to carry it.

I would have enjoyed a little more as to the 'why' besides 'It's Mischief Night', especially when the slasher apparently has taken to attacking the same house at least two years in a row. Really? Kind of lame, especially when there's no explanation offered.

A decent movie IF you have the patience to get past the lengthy set-up in the first half of the movie. And, of course, it never hurts when Richard Riehle (a.k.a 'Tom' in Office Space, the 'Jump to Conclusions' matt guy) shows up for a moment or two.

If you are twelve years old, and you want a ""scary"" movie to watch with mom, dad, and your little sister... this should work just fine. Good acting, nice camera work, decent dialogue. It even temporarily features Jerry O'Connell's goofy younger bro, the one from Sliders.
If you are a true horror hound, and especially if you are a gorehound, this flick is one HUGE waste of time. There's only one bloody scene, and that's relatively innocuous for a movie pretending to be a slasher movie (based on the completely misleading cover art). The Not Rated status isn't because the film was too extreme to get an R, like many other horror films, it's to lure poor suckers like me into thinking that... while not scaring soccer moms away with the scarlet letter. The big problem, for me, is that after almost an hour of teen life, a distinctly unrealistic lack of cursing and/or sexuality rings false. That's right. A tepid slasher flick with no F-bombs and no T&A and no hack-slashery. Sounds a bit like caffeine-free diet Mountain Dew, eh? Yeah, it's pretty lame to go from ""Wow, the acting is pretty good for an indie horror production!"" to ""Is anything remotely cool gonna happen?"" to ""I could have watched a REAL horror film.""

5966814,3,B00F3OLVWE,"Mischief Night oozes quality all around from acting to its cinematography. The story isn't new nor does it twist your head off with surprise twists and turns at every corner.
It is effective at building some fear and a sense of apprehension here and there. The problem is that we have seen this type of scenario before and we know whats will happen at the end to the girl, her dad and the bad guy's with no real payoff for the viewer. There are many plot holes in this story and some will smack you in the face they are so obvious.
If they would have spent some time at the table discussing various possible scenarios during the home invasion they could have filtered out many if not all the serious flaws that made it past the edit room. I will give a few examples for you to compare. The girls phone (where she kept it, its 911 activation or lack there of, when it was and wasn't used)??? The dad and his actions regarding his daughter??? Last but certainly not least was the saw??? Hence my title and shall we say what did I hear coming from that unplugged electric saw???
When you are under extreme duress you will do some pretty silly/dumb things, but here it was over the top and over played.
This movie was still fun to watch even with its flaws because otherwise it was a very well produced and acted movie that actually had some likable characters in it. Was it graphic? No not at all nor was it filled with foul language, sex, nudity or drugs. The violence was also held to a minimum, so this is one the whole family can watch if they are in their early teens or younger if the parents think its ok. 3 stars for production values.",1392595200,,1640,4.2935483870967746
