7856240,5,6303927319,"For a general story of 20th Century Fox and its contributions to entertainment, look no further than this biography of Darryl F. Zanuck.  A & E Biography always does well at combining personal and private, film footage and interviews, and narration in a fast-paced, meaningful way.  This documentary is on the DVD of The Grapes of Wrath.  You learn about the person of Darryl Zanuck and some of the risks and contributions he made to cinema.  One thing I found particularly interesting is that The Longest Day and The Sound of Music were both made under intense financial pressure to recover from the extremely wasteful spending of Cleopatra (which starred Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton).  Some of Zanuck's unique contributions were his willingness, like Harry Warner of Warner Brothers, to shine light on disturbing social problems, and that he used CinemaScope to get people going back to theaters after television threatened the movie industry.",1373587200,,953,5.162337662337662
