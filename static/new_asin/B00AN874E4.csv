8554539,3,B00AN874E4,The movie was interesting and several of the actors were believable in their roles which helps carry lore budget films along.  Actor Geno Romo was particularly believable.  Thanks everyone for yor performances.,1409270400,,210,5.53125
8554540,3,B00AN874E4,"Years after a gruesome murder and rape of a couple of bad actors, 4 young couples decide to camp at Lake Harris because no one goes there. Ol Mr. Mcavoy  (Bob Olin) at the filling station gave us ominous warning ad nauseum. The trip to the lake showed us kids riding in a vehicle with music in the background. No talking as that might accidentally build character. At the lake we have four horn-dogs all wanting sex and drinking micro-brews.

An hour into the film we get to know who the killer is. This is an overly formulaic plot and without all the topless ladies would rate no stars. Ashlynn Hennly (Heather Wakehouse) is not ready for sex. Guess who lives Scooby?

F-bombs, sex, rape, nudity (Cindy Millan. Nina Natascha Tomica, Jessica Fulks- thank you.)",1395360000,2,760,4.614814814814815
8554541,2,B00AN874E4,This was a low budget movie. It was good for being low budget. My biggest reason for buying it though was because my cousin had a small part in it.,1379462400,,147,3.933333333333333
8554542,5,B00AN874E4,I really enjoyed this film though low budget I liked the look and the makeup it was a good first effort I looked it up on IMDB and enjoy indie films. this film definently has flaws and is slow in places but I will leave the harsher criticizm to the haters with a hyper active sense of self importance. crack a beer sit back and have fun,1371340800,,336,4.029850746268656
8554543,1,B00AN874E4,"I am sorry to have to say how bad this movie was.  The actors were new and/or inexperienced.  They were probably just starting out or wanted to be actors.  With that being said, I must say the movie was awful!!!  I could barely watch it.  I skipped through most of it because of the bad dialogue and acting.  It was just so bad it was almost funny.

The box, as always, tricked me.  I had to throw my copy away.  At least, I didn't waste very much money, but I do wish I had it back.",1368748800,5,483,3.9479166666666665
8554544,5,B00AN874E4,"I for the most part don't enjoy horror movies.  In fact it seems to me that most horror movies have a lot of blood and gore and not much of a story line.  I enjoyed this,  because it had a story line and a surprise twist which I always enjoy.  I would recommend this movie to others who enjoy horror or some that just want a fun movie to enjoy.  If there is a second movie I will definitely enjoy that as well.  At least I will pay good money to buy and watch anyway.",1365552000,2,467,3.863157894736842
8554545,5,B00AN874E4,"Great script , acting and plot. if you want to be entertained and enjoy a few hours of your life buy this movie , invite some friends over and enjoy the evening.!",1364774400,,162,4.09375
8554546,1,B00AN874E4,"My previous experience with Brain Damage films has been less than memorable:  cheap production values, horrible effects and acting, totally reliant on gore, violence, sex and stupidity.  When I rented LAKE NOIR, I wasn't aware it's spawn of Brain Damage's seed.  Thank God I didn't buy it!
LAKE NOIR does have a slightly better ""look"" but not significantly.  The script is padded with pointless minutes of driving past boring vistas and lengthy diatribes on sexual conquests and the lack thereof.  Once again, a group of idiots go off on a weekend getaway to some isolated destination merely to drink, smoke pot and have sex---why not just stay home, save money and your life?  And once again, no one pays attention to the local looney who warns them to stay away---haven't these jerks seen a horror movie lately?  And the ending is a real hoot, with the final credits warning us of the next LAKE NOIR saga???  Do yourself a favor----avoid this movie and any future Brain Damage assaults!",1362355200,7,988,4.839285714285714
8554547,5,B00AN874E4,"Great film, tons of blood and great special effects, by the way the chicks in this film are super hot and show their bods off, so if you don't like Boobs, Blood and Beasts don't buy this.",1360886400,2,187,4.081081081081081
