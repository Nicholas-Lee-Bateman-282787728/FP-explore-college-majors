8560273,1,B00B0FRQLK,"as stated by another reviewer, this is an ANTI-drug movie, posing as a stoner zombie flick.  the only ""zombies"" are brief cameos in trip/dream sequences.  it likely has an NR rating because no self-respecting stoner or zombie fan would watch the PG rating this would receive had it applied for a rating (NO bad words, NO gratuitous gore or nudity...just a heavy ""drugs are bad"" message).

so, i'm guessing this was produced by christians or the government...or terrorists (you know, any of those types of groups of people that don't like to have any fun, and wouldn't want anyone else to have any fun either)

F this movie and everyone involved in its production/distribution/marketing.",1453852800,,686,4.991228070175438
8560274,1,B00B0FRQLK,"If you are scraping the bottom of the barrel for good zombie flicks, look UNDER the barrel and you will find this one.  Like someone already said, you have to suffer through almost an hour and a half before you even SEE a zombie, and then it's only for a couple of minutes.  The acting (the main characters, at least) wasn't THAT bad, and the production was decent - too bad the plot was lacking.",1424563200,,396,4.266666666666667
8560275,1,B00B0FRQLK,"This is an antidrug PSA barely disguised as a movie.  Two of the major problems will reveal some spoilers that you really should know before wasting your time.....how long does it take before you get a zombie onscreen?  One hour and twenty minutes!!!! No virus, no outbreak, no sickness, no death, no zombies for an hour and twenty minutes!  The other problem-spoiler alert-is that the zombies are just a figment of the characters drug hallucination.  So you get zombies for about 5-10minutes at the very end of the movie, only to find out that the zombies never happened.  Even in the worst zombie movies, at least the zombies actually happen in the movie, instead being just a dream.  Most of the movie is about how dumb the stoners are,  because they use drugs....bad, bad, bad....drugs cause you to lose your job and make stupid decisions and generally act stupid.  They try so hard to make jokes during the movie....but jokes are supposed to be funny, and most of the jokes are too stupid or too overused to bring a laugh.  If you have an ax to grind against drugs, then at least make a good movie with a subtle antidrug message....this movie has so many blatant simplistic anti drug messages that it is almost funny.....but only almost.",1410825600,,1242,4.686635944700461

A Alex Ballar flick.

You know for a drug comedy - laced with zombies,This flick rocks.

Beau Nelson is probably a responsible filmmaker and all around nice guy,But in this flick is sick-ass crazy.
Want to see the lead actress, Natalie Irby, In more films,She has a Emma Stone vibe that is very pleasing on this budgeted flick.
So,We have a drug - based comedy,Which shows two losers and the women who have invested in their nonsense of a wasted life to get high and maybe make a buck.
Their is a conscience to the film,Played by Alex Ballar himself, Who is the drug - induced victim older brother ghost,Well played and thoughtful interjection.",1371686400,4,716,4.860655737704918
