4846161,2,B005NF2UG4,"I thought the film would be of a higher quality then it was. The story seemed to stretch on longer then it needed to. Sometimes I'm succesful and find a few jems among lesser known films, Last Shot did not flow well for me.",1363737600,,223,4.090909090909091
4846162,5,B005NF2UG4,Would like to be able to show this to young inmates . . . so much hope for a future in this film.,1360800000,,97,3.260869565217391
4846163,5,B005NF2UG4,"To see what hep pen in this movie was very touching as Father of a son, My son told me one time that he's wasn't going to tell me because he's not a snitch But instead yet he would rather go to jail,! I wanted to put my fist in his mouth I was so mad, I don't understand we're this false since of loyalty comes from. U can only teach u'r kids and try and protect them from the streets as well as people and life, But when it comes down to it they are going to do what they want to do even with u'r teaching.
But the hardest thing to do is to let u'r kids out the door and hope that nothing won't hep pen to u'r kids in most case is to try not to think about it. This is why we need gun control in our city's,",1358812800,4,708,3.633986928104575
4846164,2,B005NF2UG4,"over dramatic, predictable, cheesey.  pretty much just an hour and a half of a guy preaching lessons.  acting was terrible.  i chose the wrong movie to watch on a boring friday night.",1358467200,,183,4.65625
4846165,5,B005NF2UG4,When this nmovie started off I thought it was going to be cheesey. Looked cheaplly made.  But after I started to get into it a little more it became interesting. At about the middle I was on the edge of my seat wondering what is going to happen next. I am telling all my friends about this movie.  A must see...,1346803200,4,311,4.081967213114754
4846166,5,B005NF2UG4,"The movie was very touching. For an independent film, I think 5 stars is more than warranted.  I liked the soundtrack...it fit the scenes well. There was some depth to each of the characters. I liked the different personalities of the children in the Lewis family.

It is a drama about every day family struggles, to which I am sure we can all relate. ...Questioning the principles your parents have taught you. Questioning past and present loyalty to your friends. Questioning where you fit in... No matter who you are, many of the messages speak to various aspects of life in general and will likely have you reflecting on specific events in your own life.

They were trying to evoke certain emotions throughout the movie and I definitely  felt what they wanted me to feel. I was entertained througout the entire hour and a half, which almost felt short. I definitely could have watched more.

It is very worth the purchase! Definitely check it out! I will surely recommend this movie to my friends and family.",1324684800,9,1012,4.7272727272727275

4846169,5,B005NF2UG4,"This movie was very entertaining. The characters were real, believable and well developed. One minute I was laughing and the next minute I was crying and I ended up cheering at the end of the film. I hope there is a part two.
The movie is based on a true story. I wanted to know the real story. I am recommending this to all of my friends.",1323216000,5,339,4.074626865671642

4846187,5,B005NF2UG4,"Very well directed film based on a true story. The story is not ""lame"" or stereotypical.

This is a must see for both parent(s) and child to sit down and watch together. Great job!",1372377600,,339,4.230769230769231
4846189,1,B005NF2UG4,"It's a shame that every time I want to watch and Afro American movie I only have 3 subjects to choose from; 1. In the hood with drugs and prostitution 2. Dysfunctional families 3. Loud and angry promiscuous black men and women. I'm a African American women in my 30's and I do not relate to 95% of the 1 dimensional characters that are suppose to portray us and our culture in the average African American movie and TV show. Such a joke!

This movie is such a downer, it glorifies light skin over dark skin with the stereotyped loud loud black women rolling her head.

And the bamboozled I have arrived black middle class, that are afraid in many cases to call Eurocentric racist america's judicial system anti-black and racist.
America's Prison system is over 50 percent black. yet we only make up 12% of the entire nations whole. White Europeans make up over 45 percent and are the least to be arrested or convicted for anything!

The families son is framed by racial profiling white cops and a bamboozled black Oreo and yet there is no mention the entire movie or racism and modern day anti-black laws in America that destroy the lives of many young aspiring African American boy and girls and men and women. Wake up Afro America start writing movie plots that actually show us as inteligent 3 diminsional people just as valuable as whites and other races.

Thank You.",1370822400,,1371,4.583673469387755
