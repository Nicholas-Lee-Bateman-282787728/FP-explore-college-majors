2667356,4,B000J6E0T2,"Well it is possible for even a devoted actor Humphrey Bogart and crime novelist Dashiell Hammett aficionado to learn something new.  For many years I had assumed that the 1941 hard-nosed Bogie as Sam Spade version of The Maltese Falcon was the original screen version of  Hammett's crime noir classic.  Then an acquaintance, the old time radical journalist Josh Breslin whose by-line for half the progressive press and alternate vision journals in this country for the past  forty years that some readers may know, informed me that an older version (or rather versions existed).  That discovery however had to go unchecked until the age of the Internet. Now I have found the film via a very helpful lead from Wikipedia. Kudos.

Of course after reading Hammett's crime novel countless times (if for no other reason than that great dialogue even after the plot line wore thin) and viewing the 1941 Bogie version almost as many times certain prejudices were bound to show up. The key is the role of Sam Spade as the world weary scrappy avenger of his partner's murder while ""in the line of duty"". If for no other reason than for professional pride. And the well-known plot line, basically murder and mayhem by parties known and unknown searching for a bid, ""the stuff of dreams,"" is what let's Sam save the day, his professional pride, and his roughhewn sense of justice.

The 1931 Spade (played by handsome Richard Cortez) is less concerned with those gritty issues, more brazenly cynical, and much more of a womanizer than Bogie's Spade (although he is not immune, temporality at least, to femme fatale charms). That as I found out was a result of the change in what was deemed acceptable to the general audience (the so-called Production Code). In the 1931 version it is clear, very clear, why Spade is ready to chase after windmills for the femme fatale (played Bebe Daniels). Sexual tension and adventure were rife. In the 1941 version I was always wondering what there was about Mary Astor (after all she didn't seem Bogie's type on the face of it) that made him all that intrepid. It was never spelled out. Now I know. No question though, despite that new information, that Bogie's Spade is the cinematic standard and Hammett would agree.",1331510400,2,2242,4.8077922077922075

2667360,5,B000J6E0T2,">>>I bought this set only to see the film SATAN MET A LADY (1936); therefore, this review only applies to that film and the quality of that film.

How fortunate we are to have SATAN MET A LADY on DVD, especially in the excellent condition of which this film is presented here.  The film quality is wonderful and the film appears to be complete.

As for the movie itself, perhaps not revered as a class today, eh?  Yes, there is no denying it lacks sophistication. The plot is relatively watered down from what we know as THE MALTESE FALCON of 1941.  Basically, if you are expecting anything like the later version of the story, prepare to be disappointed.

Despite its shortcomings, SATAN MET A LADY has moments where it glitters.  Arthur Treacher is particularly entertaining, although his character is never really fully developed. Warren William is a bit scary at times as the private detective Ted Shayne.  I don't know what he was going for with that otherwise lovely voice of his... Was he going for a southern accent?  Comes off as just plain weird.  Even so, his energy and wit make an otherwise dull movie enjoyable.  I would like to add that a DVD set showcasing William's pre-code films is long overdue.  He was a fascinating actor who starred in many interesting films of the early 1930s; why his talent is so over looked today, I do not know.

Now to step on some toes of the Bette Davis fans... Perhaps what is really disappointing about the film is the amount of effort Warren William puts into his role only to be weighed down by Bette Davis' apparent lack of interest.  She adds nothing to her role and takes energy away from a film that cries for enthusiasm to keep it afloat as a comedy.

I suppose what the film was aiming to be was a madcap screwball comedy poking fun at heavy detective mysteries.  Final verdict: Although the film falls short on so many occasions, the moments where SATAN MET A LADY succeeds can be brilliant.",1228176000,12,1949,4.557471264367816
2667361,4,B000J6E0T2,"I like the Latin Lover from NYC, named Ricardo Cortez for the Silents, in most every talkie he made. Not a first rate actor, by any means, never got over the accentuated speech meant to reduce the impact of his origins, but still a screen presence. His version of the Maltese Falcon is not the Classic that was later produced by Bogart and a Stellar supporting cast,  but still worth watching for its own sake as well as an historical document.
For Warren William, the studio set out to make a film that would be somewhat classier than the usual 'B' movies to which he had descended from co-starring in 'A's in his earlier career. (Perry Mason, the Lone Wolf and a couple of Philo Vance's are still popular today with many fans. He also did supporting, if not featured, A  roles throughout his short career,  terminated by death at age 53).
Clearly he was instructed to give it the same effervescent womanizing touch he had mastered for his starring B roles; that, certainly, was the flavor they sought to create for this remake. In general he does it well, although going over the top occasionally. Arthur Treacher is quite good in his rather abbreviated appearances and Bette Davis, still not the Great Lady she became later, does a pretty good job playing it light in a way she rarely was allowed to do in her later 'serious' roles (except, if I recall correctly, in the occasional light roles she played, among others, with James Cagney and quite successfully, with Monty Woolley in 'The Man Who Came to Dinner'). If you are able to take the film for what it tried to be, it should be satisfying. I suspect, however, the average viewer who has grown up with the Bogart version will have a hard time swallowing this farcical one.
All in all, the set can be quite entertaining for those who can avoid moment by moment comparisons with the Bogart version (which reflected also the valuable input of the talented young Huston). Certainly, I enjoyed it.",1432512000,,1952,4.619596541786744

2667366,4,B000J6E0T2,"SATAN MET A LADY (1936)is a liberal adaptation of ""The Maltese Falcon"" starring Warren William and Bette Davis.

Fans of the '41 Huston film enjoy hating this one but it's really not that bad if you accept it's an ""inspired by"" work.

All of the character names are different as are some circumstances, but there's enough here that if you saw ""Satan"" for the first time you would recognize where it came from.

Here, Ted Shane, our pseudo Sam Spade, arrives in town to take up with his former partner at the Ames Detective Agency. Of the three versions of Spade, Williams plays him most like a very sexually active fellow. Of course Ames is killed while trailing a man for a lady client (Davis) and Shane takes over the business.

Joel Cairo is here a very tall Englishman (Arthur Treacher) and the ""Fat Man"" is a fat woman (Alison Skipworth) with a sissy boy son (Maynard Holmes as our Wilmer Cook substitute). The falcon is now an ivory horn that's supposed to be filled with precious gems. This transformation of the ""dingus"" allows for a wry moment, when Shane manages to make a trumpet sound with it.

The picture's best sequence occurs dockside, a shootout between all the main characters, and the story ends with a bit of trickery that happens at a train station, just before Shane goes off with.......who?

If you're a  Maltese Falcon fan SEE this one. The essence of Dashiell Hammett's original remains while the many differences are most interesting.",1386806400,4,1460,4.701960784313726

2667370,5,B000J6E0T2,"In 1539 The Knight Templars of Malta paid tribute to Charles V of Spain, by sending him A Golden Falcon encrusted from beak to claw with rarest jewels.

After years of watching ""The Maltese Falcon"" I just found out about the other two versions. So I bought ""Dangerous Woman"". I was surprised to find it was distributed by ""VideoYesteryear"" as I have several of the films that used to come in the yellow jacket.

At first you need to overcome the differences, comparing and contrasting the two film versions. Then you realize that this film can stand on its own. I only could imagine what they could have done with this film if it had been an hour and a half long. A lot of the dialog is the same and actually they play out many scenes that were only implied in the 1941 version. However the characters are not as fleshed out. The camera is usually stationary giving this film the feel of a play. Wilmer Cook the gunsel has a much smaller part as he does not have to make Sam Spade look so tough. You also can see why the police think that Sam had something going with Iva Archer his partner's wife due to the fact that he comes on to anything female.

Basic story is Sam Spade (Ricardo Cortez) and Miles Archer (Walter Long) runs a detective agency. Sam is the type to chase anything in a skirt. Archer overhears a telephone conversation between Sam and Iva (Thelma Todd.) You figure this is going somewhere when it is interrupted by work. A mysterious woman Ruth Wonderly (Bebe Daniels) is looking for her sister. Supposedly her sister was abducted by the ruthless Thorsby. They plan to tail Thorsby to recover the sister. Wonderly pays them enough to make the story worth their while.  Later Miles ends up dead. And the police (rightly so) have their eye on Sam. Now Sam must prove it was not he.

8149315,5,B000J6E0T2,"The Maltese Falcon (1931) & Satan Met a Lady (1936)

The first DVD contains the original ""The Maltese Falcon"" movie from 1931 (later renamed ""Dangerous Female"") and the ""Satan Met a Lady"" movie from 1936. The original ""TMF"" is slightly better than the 1941 version because of the improvements in the story. The version ""SMaL"" from 1936 has different characters but the same plot (they want the jeweled ivory horn of Roland). This basic plot (private investigator is hired to find a missing valuable item) was used in other stories, such as ""The Big Sleep"", ""The Lady in the Lake"", ""The High Window"", etc.

The 1931 version of ""TMF"" is better (like when Sam Spade talks to Lee Fu Gow, and later joins the DA department). I think the villain ""Caspar Gutman"" is more realistic in the 1931 version; so too the ending for Gutman and Cairo. The less successful ""SMaL"" suggests that turning a murder mystery into a comedy doesn't work well (like the 1973 movie ""The Long Goodbye""). You need comics for a comedy, not dramatic actors trying a new skill. [Too bad we never had ""Abbott & Costello Meet the Maltese Falcon"". I once saw a Three Stooges comedy that parodied the 1950s ""Dragnet"" TV show.] Brown Holmes wrote the screenplays for these films.

The second DVD contains a documentary about these films. Thelma Todd played ""Iva Archer"" in the 1931 film. Dwight Frye, famous for his role in the 1931 ""Dracula"" movie, played the boyish gunman. Most of the scenes in these movies take place indoors for lower costs. Like other mystery movies and novels from that period people are gathered together in the final scene that solves the murders. People talk about the filming techniques used in the 1941 film and their fictional characters. The 1931 film noted that Sam Spade would either find the murderer or be charged with the crime. Dark scenes (""film noir"") are one result from keeping lighting costs down.

This DVD shows the movie trailers that advertised Bogart's movies in the 1940s with a commentary. [Reviews by newspaper critics are often a form of advertising for the movie theaters that advertise in the same newspaper. The bankruptcy of most theaters led to an end of newspaper movie critics.] They are also three audio versions of ""TMF"" that were broadcast in the 1940s. Lux Radio Broadcast of 2/8/1943 (soap sponsor); Screen Guild Theater Broadcast of 9/20/1943; and Academy Award Theater Broadcast of 7/3/1946. [One of them sounds like the 1941 movie.] Dashiell Hammett's involvement with politics led to his blacklisting in show business. His conviction for contempt of Congress led to a prison sentence (refusal to turn over the names of donors to a political fund). Was his heavy drinking to blame? He stopped writing when he went to Hollywood in the 1930s.",1473120000,,2768,4.858050847457627

This review is pretty much dedicated to The Maltese Falcon.

It is definitely worth seeing at least once.  It really doesn't hold up compared with the 1941 version.  Despite being pre-code, it is no more titillating than than the 1941 version.  It also doesn't hold together at the end, where Wilmer is given up as the fall guy.  There's no animus established at all, since there was no previous interaction between Sam Spade and Wilmer up to that point.

Cast notes:

Sam Spade:  Ricardo Cortez is both too pretty and not nearly shabby enough for the part.  Bogart's portrayal is much more convincing and appropriately hard boiled.  Bogart seemed to have a better grasp on the character altogether.

Ruth Wonderly:  Bebe Daniels is as good or possibly a little better than Mary Astor.  For one thing, she does indignation a lot better.

Caspar Gutman:  No comparison here.  Dudley Digges does not come close to Sydney Greenstreet.  He's suitably slimy, but not convincingly evil.

Joel Cairo:  Again, no comparison.  Otto Matieson is certainly pretty enough, but lacks the delicious oiliness of Peter Lorre.

Wilmer Cook:  Dwight Frye is not nearly as menacing or as paranoid as Elisha Cook, Jr.

Iva Archer:  Thelma Todd is very good here.

Screenwriting:  It lacks the sparkling dialog, pressing pace or coherency of John Huston's version.  The climactic scene, where Spade tells Wonderly he's sending her over, lacks the incredible speech that Bogart (as Spade) delivers.  The basic concept is there, but there is no passion at all.

Direction:  How can you do any better than John Huston? (A rhetorical question).  The story doesn't flag, but the intensity is missing.",1433894400,4,1779,4.882154882154882
