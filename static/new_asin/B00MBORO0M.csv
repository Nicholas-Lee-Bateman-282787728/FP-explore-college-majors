6567821,3,B00MBORO0M,"The writing's a bit on-the-nose and heavy-handed in its message. If you don't know anything about Australia's systemic racism towards native people, this might be informative. For me, the film - in some parts - felt a bit overtly sentimental. I think there are other films that address this issue with more power. Still, this film is definitely worth watching - because of the incredible David Gulpilil, an actor of rare ability. And his considerable talents give this film a wonderfully raw, authentic feel.",1458691200,,508,5.059523809523809
6567822,5,B00MBORO0M,Excellent film! Beautifully shot and a stirring narrative about the personal and societal drama when tradition and oppression of modern life collide.,1458432000,,149,5.818181818181818
6567823,4,B00MBORO0M,"the film is good but Amazon Prime video is crap, I cannot download the film to watch offline, what is the point of buying something if you cannot have it to keep??",1457049600,,163,4.125
6567824,5,B00MBORO0M,"An excellently written, acted & directed film depicting an Australian Aboriginal trying to cope with government laws but being frustrated (or ""screwed"") no matter what he does. Reminds me of other stories about citizens being in like situations in other countries & cultures - e.g. "" The Good Soldier vejk.""",1456099200,,307,5.16
6567825,4,B00MBORO0M,"I just finished watching the movie elsewhere and it's excellent.

It demonstrates, for example, laws made without any wisdom and the conflicts that come out of them.

David is essentially told at a couple of points that he needs to eat a healthier diet, which is his desire, but the whites have done everything in their power to prevent that, he's not allowed to hunt because he doesn't have the necessary licenses or because a spear is a dangerous weapon. The local stores only carry ""fast foods"". The prison food ends up being healthier than what he's allowed to get outside prison. It just ends up being senseless overall.

It might be likened to ""The Gods Must be Crazy III"".

6567826,4,B00MBORO0M,"Extremely sad and touching film done with beautiful cinematography and acting.  David's face conveys so much emotion that it made my heart ache at times.  I felt it could have been shorter and still made its point.  Slow, but in keeping with the traditional pace of the culture.  Heartbreaking film in so many ways.  Having visited Australia many years ago, I learned a great deal and had sensitivities to these topics ever since.",1454716800,,430,4.835616438356165
6567827,4,B00MBORO0M,"It is a good story, but moves oh sooo slow!  Kind of a parallel to the way Native Americans were treated early on...but in Australia.",1444867200,,133,4.32
6567828,5,B00MBORO0M,"This movie demonstrates the challenges of discrimination, clashes of different cultures, the foreign elements of a White society disrupting an aboriginal way of life on multiple levels, addiction as a way of coping, a culture on dependency, and so on....",1443139200,3,254,5.375
6567829,5,B00MBORO0M,"Profoundly moving film about the injustices perpetuated upon the indigenous people of Australia featuring a staggering performance by David Gulpilil. While the movie deals with heartbreaking subject matter, it isn't a downer. Watching Charlie's Country is a bittersweet experience. Yes, it contains hard truths but it does so with such empathy and craft that you'll be lifted up by its humanity and artfulness while being appalled and angered by the harsh realities it exposes.

Thank god for video on demand. It gives us the opportunity to see films that no longer get the kind of theatrical distribution great films like Charlie's Country used to command. I cannot recommend this film more highly and it deserves a wide audience.",1439856000,13,731,5.194915254237288
8671507,5,B00MBORO0M,"Charlie's  Country is a wonderful film and screen written by David Gulpilil whose career spans modern Australian cinema from his first big role in the classic paranormal thriller The Last Wave. The camera work is beautiful with many slow and still takes, not your typical Hollywood cinematography.",1507334400,,297,5.319148936170213

8671510,3,B00MBORO0M,"Interesting character.  Life in the Outback fighting the man.  I kept waiting for the exciting part of the movie to begin.
I expected a little more than what looked like a homemade documentary",1480636800,,192,4.787878787878788
8671511,4,B00MBORO0M,Amazing thought provoking.  Sometimes hard to hear the dialogue.  Otherwise great!,1479254400,,82,6.363636363636363

8671513,5,B00MBORO0M,"Healthy free culture usurped and marginalized by the white conquerers of old. Let's poison the land and criminalize there culture there tools there medicine then let's poison them with our culture,medicine, junk food and laws ! Don't forget to plunder there own land and belongings. Give them no choice but to become white(civilized) or die. The white mans rules are to kill its own mother. Mother Earth Mother Nature and our precious Mother People-""The Orgininals""! We have them in every major region and we do this to them every where we go. Alaska, Hawaii, North America, Mexico, South America, Asia, East Timor, AFRICA(mother land) & Australia just to name a few. Keep them poor, disempowered and badly misinformed. I constantly find myself asking if we are civilized then why on earth are our laws so savage. I suspect WE(white Europeans)are the savages and plunderers!!!!! This movie shows the viewer how this happens to a people but it also neglects the small attempts by local and national Gov. efforts to minimize the damage. Probably because in many cases it's virtually non existent.",1474416000,,1094,5.0497237569060776

8671515,5,B00MBORO0M,"Wow. I got so tired of reading reviews that said over and over .. too slow a movie, plot doesn't move fast enough, not enough dialogue. In spite of the review, got this anyway and was very glad I did.  I have taste in movies that includes really cinematic and delicately tempo'ed movies of 'world cinema.' This is up there as fabulous cinema in my opinion. Director Rolf De Heer also directed 'Ten Canoes' which was a stunning movie.. I am an expat Australian and this was deeply moving, deeply intimate and stayed with me for days. I deeply appreciate the subtleties of this movie to delicately tease out the nuances of the rifts between white and blackfella culture. David Gulpilil is an incredible actor (Walkabout 1971 - remains a classic). Watching Gulpili move across the screen there is a grace in him that is breathtaking. It's a tender and touching film and I plan on watching again.",1463011200,4,892,4.6455696202531644
8671516,5,B00MBORO0M,"The story depicts the social clash between the colonizing white culture and the current day aboriginal peoples of Australia, showing the many frustrations on both sides in maintaining what each sees as the best way to have ""order"".  In the midst of following the main character, Charlie, an aged, former bushman from the wilds, there is a light humor through out as he tries to adjust to living in a white civilization with its many social and economic traps that make it inevitable for him to return, although short lived, to the more familiar, primitive life in the wilds again, on his own.  What he finds missing, are the old social structures of a tribal group which once made life there successful, without which, he can not remain alone.",1459209600,3,743,4.751937984496124
