3557332,2,B001EUSYB2,"We were curious to learn about the free masons in our community so we bought this video.  The movie started way back in history and kept showing witchcraft signs and what the guy was saying didn't make much since to us simple folk.  Then, we saw our little terrier dog bounce up and down on the couch as if something was lifting her up and down.  Once we saw that, we decided it must have some kind of witchcraft or spirits in it, and since we were bored with it anyhow we threw it in the fireplace.",1235088000,3,499,4.123711340206185
3557333,4,B001EUSYB2,"This is a vividly imagined and easy to follow look at a number of so-called secret societies and the symbols and devices associated with them through the ages. Gardiner is in his element discussing the New World Order of H.G. Wells and the duality of information on groups from the Illuminati to the Freemasons, the psychology and community vs. the sometimes bloody and awful acts committed by the powerful orders.",1233705600,2,414,4.928571428571429
3557334,4,B001EUSYB2,Learn about all aspects of ancient secret societies. And the sacred knowledge they have been keeping secret for so long. An interesting look at how secret societies show the true nature of man.,1233619200,4,193,4.878787878787879

8299533,5,B001EUSYB2,"Everything in our society is controlled by puppet masters who manipulate us into thinking that we are in control. It is doubtful that even the president knows that he is nothing but a pawn. The truth is frightening, and will lead you down a road of horrible discoveries, but the truth will free us. We must know if we are to act as ourselves, and not be lead by human puppets.",1374883200,,376,4.309859154929577
8299534,5,B001EUSYB2,There have always been those who hide the truth from us. This may sound like the ultimate conspiracy theory but watch this dvd and you'll really start to wonder about it all. I know I have.,1374883200,,189,4.277777777777778
8299535,4,B001EUSYB2,"Secret societies and conspiracy theories abound in this truly revealing documentary. Particularly interesting was the look inside a freemason hall and the theories presented in the narration. The film itself may not be the greatest production but the content was very informative. If you're expecting a Hollywood-coated film version of Dan Brown's fiction novels, you'll be disappointed. If you're expecting a revealing look into freemason and secret societies, complete with raw footage and educational narration, you should definitely watch this film.",1294272000,2,553,5.839506172839506
8299536,1,B001EUSYB2,"Regardless of whether you start from the perspective of a skeptic or a believer, you won't learn anything from content free, poorly made this movie. Some of the very positive reviews sound a bit self promotional. Of course, I don't think there's a conspiracy by people involved in the production of the movie to give it four or five stars. I'm just sayin'....",1292112000,3,359,4.714285714285714
8299537,3,B001EUSYB2,"There's a Freemason Hall just a mile from where my BF lives and every time we pass by we wonder what sort of meetings and rituals may be going on.  I'd like to believe it's something really interesting or even a bit creepy, though it could be just a bunch of old guys sitting at a table playing poker.  I watched this film to get an inside view of what a Freemason Hall looks like and to learn some facts as to what it was all about.  They also take a look at other Secret Societies such as the Illuminati, as well as the New World Order.  What's not to love about Secret Society theories and information?  Unlike some other films that really bend the mind, this one was interesting and easy to grasp, there were even some humorous parts.  Anyone who's interested in learning more about these groups should definitely watch this film.  You won't be disappointed.",1288483200,,862,4.417721518987341
8299538,1,B001EUSYB2,"The production is poorly organized. After 20 minutes of dark, computer-generated graphics and badly recorded eerie music I realized that I had learned NOTHING! This was a waste of time and money.",1265068800,3,195,5.125
8299539,3,B001EUSYB2,"I am sorry the couple that claims
to have thrown it into their this
ionto their fireplace, needed more
education on the subject. Or maybe
more firewood! This is very good.

Better than the raving Texe Marrs or
watered down Dan Brown stuff. Pick Up
On It!",1248393600,,254,4.404255319148936
8299540,1,B001EUSYB2,"Don't wast your money. I have seen better. The accented voice was hard to understand with the continued electronic type music blarring. The continued psychedelic images were distracting. Some didn't even make any sense to what was being narrated. It did get better 3/4 into the video, but still not worth it.",1246147200,3,308,4.9423076923076925
8299541,4,B001EUSYB2,"The entire secret society phenomenon is one that is of interest to intellectuals across the globe.  This translated very well in this simple, if not informative film.  There were light spots mixed with somewhat intimidating information.  If you are reading this, you are obviously interested in this subject and will find this film engaging and easy to watch.",1236902400,2,359,5.155172413793103
