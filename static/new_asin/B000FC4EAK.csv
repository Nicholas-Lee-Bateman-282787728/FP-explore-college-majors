2560601,5,B000FC4EAK,"Tom Yum Goong or ""Warrior King"" or "" The Protector"" is Tony JAA 2nd Famous (following Ong-Bak, The Thai Warrior)

first of all,  I do like this movie. However Ong-Bak was more realistic, and very entertaining by his co-actor (the #1 Thai Comedian). It almost like ""Rush Hour"", by Chris Rock. The fighting scenes in Tom Yum Goong were better especially at the end when he broke the (HUGE) guys legs one by one by one!!!.It really show that Muey Thai or Thai boxing is very dangerous and CAN'T BE the Olympic type of sports.

The bad thing about this movie is that the story is so ....NOT that good. I thing the director tried to make this movie ""International) But he just not there yet. He should watch all of the "" Steven Seagal"" or ""Jean-Claude Van Damme"" since they both LOVE Thailand SO MUCHH and had quite a few movies done there!! (Van Damme even had his Wedding there!!)

you don't care about the story line, which's of course FAR FAR FAR away from Oscar/Hollywood or even the dumpest movie by ""Steven Seagal"", Tom Yum Goong is the best of the best of the Martial Arts movie EVER....well Maybe ONG-BAK was...you just have to watch both and decide which one is the best!!.

By the way, I heard Tony Jaa might be Jackie chan co-actor soon...He's now learning English. Can't wait to see that!",1156464000,3,1296,4.47457627118644
2560602,5,B000FC4EAK,"Tom-Yum-Goong (which is a popular Thai dish) comes two years after the success of Ong Bak: Thai Warrior and once more displays Tony Jaa's kinetic and concussive full-contact martial arts. Once again, just like in Ong Bak, the fight scenes do away with stunt doubles, wire-work or CGI. What the audience gets, instead, is a pure, unadulterated, very intense Tony Jaa doing his own eye-popping stunts.

When a bull and baby elephant are stolen from his family by the Asian Mafia and smuggled into Sydney, Australia, young Thai fighter Kham (Tony Jaa) follows to recover the sacred animals and exact [...]-kicking vengeance. In Sydney,  he is befriended and aided by Sergeant Mark (Petchthai Wongkamlao), a Thai policeman toiling in Australia and by Pla (Bongkuch Kongmalai), a Thai girl and victim of a modern day slave ring. But, even with their help, can Kham beat the overwhelming odds as represented by syndicate boss  Madame Rose and her numerous hencemen? I'm guessing... yeah.

The plot and actors aren't what you'd call top-notch (and the sub-title work is very shaky), although, in the midst of all the explosive fight scenes, you do have a rather sweet love story between a boy and his elephants. But, let's get real here; if you've come to this movie expecting quality exposition and Shakespearean emoting, boy, are you in the wrong part of town. Tom-Yum-Goong is a martial arts flick thru and thru, where a cohesive storyline and professional acting are eschewed for all-out, bone-crushing, head-bashing, nut-cracking Muay Thai mayhem.

Tony Jaa is the fresh face of martial arts and he's coming hard. It's a revelation to see him go up against and dispose of a hard crew of extreme sports thugs, Asian Mafia henchmen, several giants escaped from Wrestlemania, and a few practitioners of various martial arts (wushu, capoeira, etc.). The warehouse fight is typically high energy and shows off Tony Jaa's agile acrobatics. And, an hour into it, there's an extended fight sequence (about 4 minutes) which takes place inside a multi-floored restaurant - where a camera is continuously on Jaa for the whole length - that has to be seen to be believed. Kham rumbles his way up every level of the bordello, facing a host of baddies each time he ascends a floor (Game of Death, anyone?). The culminating fight sequence - where Jaa goes up against about 30 black-clad henchmen and uses various leg holds and arm locks to crackingly snap limbs and break body joints - is mind-boggling! As of right now, he's giving Jackie Chan and Jet Li a run for their money.

Tony Jaa, when not fracturing jaws or pulverizing clavicles with his vicious elbow strikes and knee thrusts, has an innocent, unaffectedly fresh persona he resorts to when he has to act. He made his loyalty and love for his elephants very genuine to the audience and realistically grounded the movie's main plot motivation. To his character Kham, these pachyderms were indeed treasured family members, members who he'll go thru hell and high water for. It's interesting to see if his acting evolves along with his martial arts moves. Petchthai Wongkamlao (also from Ong Bak, as George) as Sergeant Mark is decent as the unorthodox but upright cop. Johnny Nguyen as Johnny, to me, is the standout villain.

So, what more can I say? Tom-Yum-Goong will be released here in the States under the film title The Protector on September 8, 2006. So check it out and jump on the Tony Jaa bandwagon, while there's still room.",1155945600,8,3478,4.894736842105263
2560603,5,B000FC4EAK,"For those who've seen ""Ong Bak"" - Tony Jaa's previous film - I have to say that you know roughly what you're going to see, only this movie is even better. And those who haven't - well, what you are about to see you're not going to forget for a long time. The plot is practically the same as in ""Ong Bak"" - some villains kidnap a simple village guy's (who by the way practices Muay Thai) elephant. The guy leaves for big city to find those who did it and take his elephant back. Certainly he's going to do a lot of fighting.

Tony Jaa is something you've never seen before - a Jackie Chan kind of stuntman but tougher, can you imagine that? It's amazing what he does on screen (and everything is managed without any CG or wire as you probably heard already) - he jumps so high you wouldn't believe it, he fights dozens of enemies and wins while you don't have a slightest doubt he couldn't do it, he runs on walls and does all kinds of acrobatic and martial arts stuff that will blow your mind. All of his punches and kicks look real, and both in Tony Jaa's movies and in behind the scenes footage you can see he really delivers his punches, they are not just waving hands and legs in front of someone's face. I remember old Van Damme films where the major part of his kicks were not real and you could see he actually didn't kick anyone. But in ""Tom Yum Goong"" when Tony Jaa fights two guys who both are 7-feet tall and weighing more than 300 pounds it actually takes something and not just imitating kicks to persuade the audience he can really win this fight. And the fight looks ferocious because it's done on the verge of rationality and sense.

There's another scene which lasts about 5 or 7 minutes or maybe more when Tony goes in some casino that belongs to the bad guys, and he goes farther and farther fighting everyone who dares standing on his way. And this scene is done in 1(!) take. Where have you seen something like that? I haven't. And by the way all the fighting is shot beautifully with nice wide shots so that you can see everything in detail not wondering what it is glimpsing on screen.

There're many different stunts in ""Tom Yum Goong"", if you love martial arts cinema you'll appreciate it a lot, and even if you're not a fan you'll be extremely impressed. For you haven't seen anything like this neither in Jackie Chan movies nor in those of Jet Li. For me ""Tom Yum Goong"" was a kind of revelation. A cinematic one and also regarding the abilities of human body.",1155513600,18,2487,4.298507462686567
2560604,5,B000FC4EAK,"When I saw Ong Bak the first time I was really surprised. It's really a great movie with moves never seen before in a movie. Okay, the story isn't a very special one, but I don't remember a Martial Art - Movie with a really good story (and there a lot of these movies without good story - Jackie Chan & Jet Li movies for example).

So I wanted to rate Ong Bak with 5 stars, but a few weeks later I could see Tom Yum Goong and I really had big expectations... and I'm happy that I don't have to be dissapointed. I really thought Ong Bak is unreachable, but I was wrong. Tom Yum Goong is even better!!! The moves are similiar to the Ong Bak's ones, but that is Muay Thai...and I hope after a few Ton Jaa - Movies the style will change a little bit, because if it doesn't change it's possible these movies will be boring and all the same.

Tom Yum Goong is one of the best Martial Art - Movies I've ever seen.

Five deserved stars !!!",1154822400,4,931,4.021621621621621
2560605,4,B000FC4EAK,"When I first saw Ong-Bak (that was last week), I thought to myself, ""damn, this movie is amazing!!!"".  I told all my friends about it.  I was hooked on wanting to watch more of Tony Jaa's movie.

Well today, I saw Tom Yum Goong and let me just say that the story was just too dumb.  Some of the fighting scenes were too exagerated, like when he put on the elephant bone and started beating up guys twice or three times the size of him.  Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy most of the fighting scenes, but this is definitely not as good as Ong-Bak.  Ong-Bak was more realistic, and yet very entertaining.",1152921600,2,600,4.219298245614035

2560607,5,B000FC4EAK,Its impossible to explain all the absurdity of this action movie. Simply put this is the Best Martial Arts action movie ever created.,1149897600,3,133,4.826086956521739
2560608,2,B000FC4EAK,"The story line for this movie is terrible and over indulgently violent where it need not be. Beat up the people all you want but no one likes to see animals die...especially elephants or Tony Jaa's father shot...um or killing a temple full of monks. Plus the movie begins with around 30 minutes of no action whatsoever...really dull with a few traumatizing elephant moments. Don't get me wrong Tony Jaa still has some sweet moves but in the end everyone is dead and you are left with that ""god what a stupid movie"" feeling. The humor tries to balance things out but nothing is really that funny. Tony gets massively plummeled a few time to the point where you just want to turn the movie off. All the times they speak in English the words in subtitles are completely wrong (why subtitle the english?) If you rent it fast forward through everything but the fight scenes. The original Ong Bak was lighter(except for the disgusting murder of the coke dealers girl) and a better ride. Producers need to think about what is entertaining and what is added for shock value. Tony has enough talent to carry him with out the horrific stuff and drug references. This movie can't decide what it wants to be...some of the scenes are quite beautiful and a few of the fights extremely creative but this is ruined by the morbidity and classlessness of the rest of the film. I really hope the next one is better.",1148860800,,1396,4.565737051792829
2560609,5,B000FC4EAK,"I saw this film film in Hong Kong last year, I took a risk because the film was not available with english subtitles at the theater I went to... it didn't need them. Tony Jaa is amazing, if you like martial arts films with real action this is the film for you! Like Jackie no special effects that make it look fake just raw action.",1147132800,4,331,4.107692307692307
2560610,5,B000FC4EAK,"This movie is just as good as Ong Bak if not better. The major difference is that Ong Bak stayed more with traditional old school techniqe as far as strikes and blocks go. Rigid and practiced. This one is more like a Jackie chan movie where the action is spur of the moment, no hours spent perfecting an elbow strike, just whatever is at hand. There are 4 fantastic fight scenes all with Tony Jaa style (crazy stunts, mind boggling technique and skill). It is much better than Jackie Chan's new one (The Myth) it seems he is going more towards acting and less for stunts and action. It pains me to say as Jackie Chan is still one of my heroes but it is time for the U.S.A. to recognize Tony Jaa as Jackie Chan's replacement.

Buy this movie there is fights with Wu-Shu, Capoeira, street-fighting, and of course Muai Thai.

There are no words available in the English language to convey how great this movie is.  BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!",1146182400,2,929,4.421052631578948

8120720,4,B000FC4EAK,"Great movie, lots of action and the martial arts is awesome.",1414022400,,60,4.545454545454546
8120721,4,B000FC4EAK,"If you like bone breaking kung fu, you came to the right place.  The movie stars Tony Jaa as an ancient Thai protector of an elephant.  The action is pretty fast paced and has 3 excellent fight scenes - one with roller bladers and bicyclists versus Tony on foot and another that happens up a circular stairway about 5 stories high!  The fighting is incredible, but the editing towards the beginning of the movie was a little choppy.  At one point, I was like how is there a boat chase right now, I didn't see anybody get into a boat?  If you like kung fu movies you definitely came to the right place.  The storyline and the acting is not the greatest but it is better than most kung fu movies I have seen.",1306108800,3,706,4.231343283582089
8120722,4,B000FC4EAK,The story is a little different from what we are used to in the states mainly because of the realtionship with the elephant in the story.  Once you understand that you really feel for the charecter in this movie.  The action is great as it gives a new spin to thai boxing.  If you like ong bak you will like this.,1289606400,,313,4.098360655737705
8120723,4,B000FC4EAK,"The story and acting is kinda weak, but it's a martial arts movie so we look the other way.  The action sequences are terrific.

There is a scene that lasts a few minutes going up a stairs through several levels of a building and the camera doesn't stop rolling.  It pans away a few times to follow bodies but that's about it.  It's not the most visually pleasing shot, but it's one take!

There is a scene in a wherehouse that feels very Rumble in the Bronx.

Visually this movie cannot compare to House of Flying Daggers, but Tony Jaa is terrific.  His opponents are different than Ong Bak so we see other fighting styles.

Very cool movie, definately buy this one.  I am enjoying watching him develop.",1187827200,,704,4.4375
8120724,5,B000FC4EAK,"It's true: nobody has ever seen nothing like it. Tony Jaa is incredible.

The movie script is lame, to say the least. Direction is faulty and pacing is so slow that the first part of the film makes you wonder if it was worth what you were paying. But the it takes off...

In as few words as possible: Country bumpkin grows up with elephant. Somehow he manages to learn the art of Muay Thai. We don't know how, from who, where, but it doesn't matter. Boy grows up. Big elephant fathers baby elephant called Korn. Baby elephant is so cute and wonderful it robs your heart forever and steals every scene. Bad guys take both elephants and country bumpkin boy lands in Australia of all places, where he has to fight local thugs to rescue elphants.

So far so good. The fights are as real as it can be made and the producers of this movie have done an incredible job. Oh, the choreography is Tony Jaa's. The man is the best ever. Bruce Lee's ""Enter the Dragon"" was cinematographically ruined by its director who insisted in close-ups and avoided wide angle photography. Not here. Oh, what a joy to watch such perfection. In slomo one can't detect any ttrickery, no misses, no fakes. The thing is for real!

I can't wait to see Tony Jaa again. He is the man.",1171670400,,1251,4.379310344827586
8120725,4,B000FC4EAK,"No argument.. Tony Jaa is amazing. And the action in this, while over the top will make your jaw drop. He is the real deal and i think anyone with any interest in martial arts or martial art movies needs to see this.  The only real problem i had was the English subtitles... there are none.  I have played this DVD on nearly 10 different players and none of them have them. This wouldnt upset me if it didn't say they were on the disc on amazon as well as on the DVD case... then again, i kinda caught the highlights... Missing elephant, TOny Jaa beats up everyone involved.  Long story short: watch this movie",1159142400,4,610,4.28695652173913
8120726,5,B000FC4EAK,i saw this movie this past spring when i was in ecuador. this movie is phenomenal i am looking forward to seeing it again this weekend...,1158796800,3,137,4.3076923076923075
8120727,5,B000FC4EAK,"I have never seen such amazing martial arts stunt work as I saw in this movie. Tony Jaa is like some kind of superhuman killing machine as he goes after the gangsters who steal his beloved elephants. To think that he uses no wires or cgi, is remarkable. A must see for all martial arts fans. RUN don't walk, RUN to get this DVD! Run, even if it means running down the street in your underwear into oncoming traffic! If it is late at night and the stores are closed in your area, RUN THERE ANYWAY, and wait all night outside untill the store opens in the morning. If the police try to stop you, run away from them, into the woods where they won't be able to find you, and continue on your way to the store through wooded areas until you get there.  DO  IT!",1158105600,6,755,4.129251700680272
8120728,4,B000FC4EAK,"In THE PROTECTOR, Tony Jaa stars as Kham, a young Muoy Thai fighter who travels to Australia to recover a pair of beloved sacred elephants that were stolen.  Around this thin thread of a plot, Jaa, who now stars in his third major film, has further established himself as the leading movie martial artist of our time.  In order for a martial artist to hit it big in the West, he has to stake out his own territory and mark it as his own.  The very best could do this with a combination of screen persona and fighting ability.  Jaa, who speaks no English, combines a basic aw-shucks innocence with a bone-crunching ability to hammerlock multiple opponents and twist their arms up and behind them with a loud popping sound. He seems to defy gravity as he bounds up walls and flips over in mid air.  Jaa does not use stunt doubles, wires, or tricky camera angles.  With each movie he makes, he plays essentially the same character: a naive young man who tries to retain his purity in the dirty world of Thai corruption. Jaa does not have a wide range of acting skills nor of emotional reflectivity not does he need any.  Unlike Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan, both of whom used humor to leaven the action, Jaa plays his part with dead seriousness.  It will be interesting to note whether Jaa chooses to stay with what has so far been a winning and profitable style or to learn to ""act"" and become more mainstream, the way that Michael Dudikoff of ""American Ninja"" fame did ten years ago.  And since Dudikoff has not been heard of since, Jaa may wisely choose to stay the course.",1157760000,3,1569,4.439024390243903
