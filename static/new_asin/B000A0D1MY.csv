2344604,2,B000A0D1MY,"It's no wonder they don't make shows like this one anymore.  My guess is that since the actors were already big stars, they didn't take this very seriously.  As a result, I'm sure the directors couldn't push very hard.  The different stories seem too long.  The Storyteller series by The Jim Henson Company was 1000x better.",1259107200,3,324,4.732142857142857
2344605,5,B000A0D1MY,"For fans of Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theater, Tall Tales and Legends represents another fantastic collection of star-studded stories. In this, her second anthology collection, Ms. Duvall focused on American Folklore stories rather than the more internationally known fairy tales of the more well known collection ""Faerie Tale Theatre"". Stories like Johnny Appleseed, Casey at the Bat, Darlin' Clementine all come alive in Tall Tales, and while the sets may be a little more sparce than in Faerie Tale Theatre, the stories and productions are once again fantastic, and the casts are once again superb. In our family, Martin Short as Johnny Appleseed is the clear cut winner among the younger sect (ages 7 and 9).

The original release of this was quite expensive and included 9 individual dvd's in individual cases. This new version is a welcomed re-build of the series onto 3 discs, compiling the stories into a smaller overall package with a very attractive price point and a smaller foot-print on the proverbial kid's shelf. Kudos to E1 for the re-formatting.",1249257600,47,1065,5.120689655172414
2344606,5,B000A0D1MY,"As a huge fan of Ms. Duvall's work on Faerie Tale Theatre, her second body of work, Tall Tales & Legends, took the same approach production wise and pointed her skills at tales of American Folklore.

Live-action and star-empowered, these tales are equally as enjoying for both young and old alike, as are the acclaimed Faerie Tale Theatre stories. Johnny Appleseed is my kids absolute fav (Martin Short as Johnny), but Casey at the Bat, John Henry... they all ad up to a wonderful body of work that interestingly plays beautifully in/around first and second grade when American Folklore is taught in the public schools (at least in our area it is). The Appleseed tale took my little girl from watching the show to wanting to, and successfully reading the tale to then... writing a little book report for her class.

Thank you Ms. Duvall, for playing a positive role in teaching my kid to read. Kudos again to you for your work.

PS: The upcoming release of Faerie Tale Theatre as a set that includes a book deserves TWO THUMBS UP, as they say. Watch them, read them. How well was THAT idea thought out??? Kudos to KOCH Vision for such great products for our children.",1219363200,12,1167,4.628019323671498

2344608,5,B000A0D1MY,"Shelley Duvall has given perhaps the best contemporary treatment to fairy tales in the last 100 years - no joke!
She has captured the true essence of the tales, and has not made them cheesy or expurgated the darker elements of the tales, like Disney always does.",1137283200,23,262,4.595744680851064

Pretty much a VHS to DVD transfer. I mean, honestly I could've cleaned it up better myself.

For the nice packaging they couldn't even afford a little remastering??
Terrible DVD menu, by the way.

Besides that, yes...I love these short stories. Very good acting, super funny and entertaining.

3 stars because the series itself is good, but the quality of the discs they are on is pretty poor.",1361318400,3,313,4.048387096774194

Didn't double check to see if it was captioned, as most shows and movies are these days.  It's not. So the only reason I gave it three stars, was because I couldn't watch it without captions.

2344654,2,B000A0D1MY,"Again, I think the adults enjoyed this DVD more than the grandkids. I don't believe I chose age appropriately so we will be tucking this one away for next summer too. Better quality though than what is currently available to show this generation of kids who are more likely to watch something than read a book about it.

2344657,1,B000A0D1MY,"I mainly bought this video because I use the poem ""Casey at the Bat' in my social studies class, and I thought that the video would be a great reinforcement.
