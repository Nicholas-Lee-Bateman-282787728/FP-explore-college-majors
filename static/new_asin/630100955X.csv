308417,4,630100955X,"I love this Movie not for the acting though. John Agar is stiff and animated and the others are your typical ""B"" actors. What I do love as a WWII buff is the equipment and uniforms. The WWII mentality is still fresh so we see this reflected in the movie. This is important to me because this Movie was made before Viet-Nam. Viet-Nam and after has tainted WWII movies with technical inaccuracies. So if your looking for great acting look elsewhere. If you want to see original equipment or want to see the mentality of a pre Viet-Nam Army watch this.",1303603200,3,549,4.445544554455446
308418,4,630100955X,I watched this movie on television with my brothers many years ago.  We watched so many times that we memorized certain lines and quoted them during the showing (at least six times a week on NY WOR-TV in the late 60's).  This DVD version brought back the memories I shared with my brothers and the nostalgic good times we shared.  I can't wait until the three of us can get together and once more enjoy a movie that we liked to watch. It isn't the greatest war movie or most accurate but we loved it anyway.,1284336000,4,507,4.260416666666667
308419,4,630100955X,"one of the first ww2 movies of the normandy invasion. story follows a platoon from the weeks before d-day to the battles after the initial invasion in the hedgerows. the movie is predictable low budget and the cast resembles the budget. david brian & frank lovejoy is decent agar is stiff and the supporting from paul picerni, dick wesson, &william campbell round a thoroughly enjoyable movie. if you like old ww2 war movies this one is okay.",1271721600,7,442,4.753246753246753
308420,3,630100955X,All the reviews except one seems to be for a Richard Burton movie by the same name. If you are going to review a movie make sure its the right movie with the right cast. I haven't seen the movies in years but as far as I remember it was a pretty good 1950's movie concerning WWII and Frank Lovejoy as the Platoon sergeant and David Brin as the company commander were excellent and John Agar as the platoon Leader was John Agar,1262649600,12,426,4.144578313253012
308421,2,630100955X,"""Breakthrough"" is an absurd copy of the excellent Sam Peckinpah's movie ""Cross of Iron"". It lacks from this standpoint originality (even the names of the characters are the same with a different  story this time in the western European theather). The recreation of war  scenes are fairly good (American tanks are from the Korean War though) and  probably the element that barely saves the movie is the fine recreation of  German uniforms (for those lovers of german WWII millitaria). The film has  a soundtrack that not matches the movie at all. Even with actors of the  caliber of Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum, and Kurt Jurgens,  ""Breakthrough"" is undoubtly a mediocre war movie.",917913600,4,682,5.035714285714286

308472,5,630100955X,"The dvd arrived on time, and in better condition than most dvds sold  retail.  The story of THE BIG RED-ONE from D-DAY, NORMANDY until their breakthrough out of the ""Hedgerows"", and onto Paris.  It also shows how combat can wear on the nerves of those in a position of responsibility.  Like ""ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT"", it introduces the viewer to a platoon of likeable individuals, and then gives us the sorrow and heartbreak when some of these individuals are killed or maimed.  Just the part-and-parcel of combat and war.  The stars are John Agar, David Brian ( as the caring and ultimately fragile Captain ) and, Frank Lovejoy as the Platoon sergeant who helps keep things together, and ho mentors ( and at times, stands-between ) John Agar's green Lieutenant, and the rapidly ( mentally ) disintegrating Captain.  This film is a MUST for all of those who like a good drama, and Military and W.W.-II  films.  Watch for entertainer Dick Wesson in his enjoyable-performance as Hanson.",1433980800,2,991,4.816568047337278

308475,4,630100955X,"Made in 1950, Breakthrough was not a big budget film but one made by people who knew combat in the Second World War.  The breakthrough comes in Normandy and gives a pretty accurate picture.  The story involves John Agar growing from novice to veteran as he learns to command from Frank Lovejoy, his sergeant.  The soldiers of his unit, including the always solid Lovejoy, represent the usual ""common man"" cross section of America in 40's and 50's war film.  The Germans are smarter and harder to dislodge than in many war films of this era and everybody is expendable.  The movie mixes real insight into the then not too distant World War Two and the conventions of Hollywood war film.",1408147200,4,685,4.675
308476,4,630100955X,This presents a fairly realistic view of the stress of combat on the officers and men in an Army company as they prepare for D-Day and later invade the coast of France.  Good action sequences.,1371945600,,192,4.485714285714286
308477,4,630100955X,"This 1950's movie is ""B"" Movie about a US Infantry Company before, on and after the D-Day Invasion of Normandy in 1944. There aren't any special effects, but there is alot newsreel footage spliced into the movie. This movie mostly concreates on what happens after the D-Day Invasion and the build up to the breakout of the Normandy Beachheads. It's ok, but its not ""Saving Private Ryan"".",1344988800,2,387,4.791044776119403
