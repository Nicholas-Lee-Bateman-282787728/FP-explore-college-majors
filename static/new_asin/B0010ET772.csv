8237800,2,B0010ET772,zzzz...forced myself to watch the entire video. It remains in its' case unused. Definetly not what I expected. I am sure there are better formats to purchase.,1294531200,,158,4.888888888888889
8237801,3,B0010ET772,"I agree with the previous poster.  I was very excited to try this method of stretching, and I believe it is an excellent method but this DVD isn't the way to learn.  There is no real flow to the video and each exercise is only done a few times on one side, creating a lot of starts and stops.  Because the movements are not repeated often enough, and the camera angles frequently don't show the entire view, what should be a superb experience becomes a maddening one.",1261440000,4,467,4.344827586206897
8237802,3,B0010ET772,"I wanted a stretching video and read great things about the Mattes method.  I opted for this one instead of one from Dr. Mattes after reading some reviews.  It is indeed very comprehensive and educational, but it is not like an excercise video format.  It shows each strech exercise and then the next one.  Since you supposed to do the stretch 8 to 10 times and 3 sets, there is not time for do it and move on to the next one.  Its literally an 1 hr. 30 min. video showing different stretches, but not a routine.  You have to decide which ones you want to do and build your own routine and then do it independently of the video.  I was looking for a workout video format where I just follow the instructor.  This is probably more applicable to a professional trainer or therapist, not the average consumer looking to be led in stretching.

But my rating is for the fact I spend $50 to get something that isn't what I really wanted.  The description isn't really clear on Amazon.  Yes, its a how-to, but not a 'follow me', type video.  The content is high quality and its well done.  Just not what I wanted.",1252627200,12,1106,4.310679611650485
8237803,5,B0010ET772,"The stretching exercises on the Dynamic Flexibilty DVD have helped me maintain my flexibility over the years, allowing me to continue social dancing, which I love, as well as maintain correct and supple posture in my daily life.  These exercises have helped decrease chronic tension in my neck, have helped maintain balance in hips, which tend towards disorganization, and have also helped rehabilitate several serious injuries. I highly recommend this DVD.",1234396800,2,457,5.436619718309859
8237804,5,B0010ET772,"Tim Agnew's new DVD for home stretching will become a staple in my therapy office.  The verbage can be easily understood by patients, yet gives them a very good education about why and what this will do to help them.  These techniques can be easily incorporated as a tool for self care.  I am also impressed that this does not seem overwhelming in content--which means better patient compliance.

I have exclusively used this method of stretching in my treatment room for many years and it is the most safe and effective stretching I have found.  This DVD will be cost-effective for patients, as they can learn from the DVD and not be in the office for multiple sessions.",1206144000,4,671,4.6525423728813555
8237805,5,B0010ET772,Timothy Agnew's technique of stretching for two seconds multiple times is an excellent way to create flexibility no matter what your age. The video is detailed enough that you can ensure that your are stretching from the right position; it is easy to use and the results are great.,1203465600,3,281,4.755102040816326
