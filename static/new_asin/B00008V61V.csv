I talked with 5-6 students that spent the summer in Israel during college, and this movie gives the same message that my friends reported years ago.  I don't know why the media can't get it right, but this movie was a great first person accounting from eye witnesses.",1396137600,,334,4.55
7987092,5,B00008V61V,"This impelling, courageous, candid and brutally honest documentary deals focuses on ordinary Israeli people during the situation of a massive wave of terrorism which swept Israel in the early years of this century. In which thousands of Israeli men and women and 123 Israeli children had their lives gruesomely and brutally cut short in bombings, shootings, stabbings, stonings and burnings and thousands more maimed and their lives effectively destroyed. This war of terror on the Israeli people was mostly stopped by the building of a security fence in 2004 which cut down the rate of murders of Israelis by 90% and was a peaceful means of doing so. But this security fence dubbed by the racist international left and Islamists as the 'Apartheid Wall' has been the target of sustained vilification and violent pressure y the international left, world media and even the UN to be removed because of the inconvenience it causes to Palestinian Authority Arabs. It is impossible to escape the conclusion that those who condemn Israel for the fence that protects millions of it's children from horrific death and maiming, do so precisely because they want to see innocent Israeli men, women and children murdered and maimed in the tens of thousands, that they believe every Jew in Israel down to the smallest child deserves to die for being an 'imperialist occupier' and 'racist' in the words of the anti-Israel demonizers.
In the first part of the documentary we get to see some of the horrors that were visited upon Israeli men, women and children in these years, including a boy that cannot function because of rat poison infected nails that were sent into his brain in a terror attack (Yes the nails in these bombs are laced with rat poison by the terrorists to inflict the maximum amount of suffering on Israelis)
In this documentary Dennis Prager interviews at the height of the atrocities visited by Hamas , Fatah, PFLP, PRCs and other terrorist outfits (terrorists being the correct word because their raison d etre is to sow death , destruction and terror) a number of ordinary Israelis form different points of life, with questions such as asking them are they sacred, why do they believe moist the world hates Israel and sides with the terrorists, do they hate Arabs and do they have hope for the future.
This part of this phenomenal work shows you that victims of terror are real, that the suffering of the people of Israel is real, no less so because they are ignored by the media and universities ignore it and paint all Israelis only as evil aggressors.
Amazing to see how little hate there is from ordinary Israelis to those who want to see every one of them destroyed.
A documentary about the amazing resilience of the bravest, most compassionate .most life affirming people on this planet (The Israelis) whatever sick propaganda you may have seen to the contrary.  In this documentary a pretty young Israeli medic is asked if one word can describe what she feels towards the Arabs it is 'compassion'
Also absolutely essential reading in this regard are the books Israel Life in the Shadow of Terror by Rabbis Nechemia Coopersmith and Shragga Simmons and A New Shoah by Gulio Meotti which shows how .once again Jews are being murdered simply for being Jews, this time for being Jews living in their ancient homeland.
As the Nazis dehumanized the Jews before the Holocaust was launched so the Arab and Leftist media and educational networks demonize the Jews of Israel in the same way.
 It is  quite clear that the issue is not about land but about the very existence of Israel, the very existence of the Jewish people.",1362355200,2,3632,4.836012861736334
7987093,5,B00008V61V,"IT'S REFRESHING TO ACTUALLY SEE THE CIRCUMSTANCES PRESENTED AS THEY SHOULD BE WHEN IT COMES TO ISRAEL'S CONSTANT POLITICAL WORLD BOMBARDMENT FOR BEING THE ""BAD GUY"".  AND, THEN, WHEN THEY PUT UP A WALL THAT ACTUALLY WORKS IN STOPPING THE CONSTANT THREAT OF HOMICIDE BOMBERS, THE WORLD WANTS THEM TO TAKE IT DOWN.  WHAT HYPOCRACY.",1346803200,2,329,4.963636363636364
7987094,3,B00008V61V,"The subject matter aside, the disc skips and stops, the audio is at such a low level full volume is required to even hear it.",1182038400,,125,4.04
7987095,2,B00008V61V,"While teaching an international studies course a few years ago, I included this DVD as part of a Middle-East unit and I was sorely disappointed.

It strikes me that in discussing the conflicts in the Middle East, a certain detached objectivity is possible only if one doesn't have a dog in the fight.  Unlike James Longley's Gaza Strip, in which no one sees or hears Longley at all as he holds his camera up close to people's lives, Israel in a Time of Terror tries desperately to frame the issue in such a pro-Israel way that it sacrifices its value as a documentary.  Clearly, the writers are biased to the point of not allowing themselves to understand or comprehend Palestinian suffering or motivation. And Prager's feeble attempt to do so distorts.

 Although it's heartfelt, and doesn't flinch when showing attrocities perpetrted by Palestinians against Israelis, the writers are so exclusively sympathetic Israeli victimization that most of the value as a learning tool is lost...

...Unless you're studying media or propaganda.  Then this documentary's weakness becomes its redemption.  But don't look to this DVD as a source of neutral, unbiased reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The makers of this film are sincerely genuine in their belief that the world is unfair and biased in support of the Palestinians and this DVD has a tone about it that suggests it.  There is a certain desperation in their tone supporing Israeli policies, however unjust or brutal.  Irrespective of ""should they have the right to protect themselves"" issues, Prager cannot see that Israel's moral soul is sacrificed by what it does so violently to the oppressed people living in their own borders.

 'Tis a shame, really,  by doing so he undercut his own work as something to take seriously.",1177804800,6,1791,5.027118644067796
7987096,5,B00008V61V,"People today are so tracked into political correctness, that they fail to see the exceptions to the rule.  There really are terrorists out there!  There really are groups who are bending Palestinian-Arab culture to produce unlimited numbers of suicidal killers.  How do they do it?  They produce Sesame Street-like shows that teach the joys of martyrdom, dressing little kids up in suicide vests.  They produce ""trading cards"" for each suicide bomber, for the kids to collect... etc.  It's hard for our Westernized, peace-loving culture to accept, but the truths of this film should not be dismissed as some ""anti-Israel propaganda""... the ugliness depicted in this film is very real, and will shock people who are living their quiet lives thinking that everyone around the world is trying to live a similarly quiet and peaceful life.  The lesson that radical Islam is producing some horrible things, should not be lost on us today.  Don't dismiss this film so quickly.  And if you want to see an even stronger, better film of this time, check out ""Obsession"" from HonestReporting.",1159228800,35,1081,5.062146892655368
7987097,1,B00008V61V,"This film is nothing more than a re-hash of some of the common techniques used to garner support for Israel.  The film focuses on trying to depict Palestinians as hate-mongering killers and trying to make Israelis appear like innocent, peace-loving, victims of racism.  By watching this film, you would think that all the atrocities committed by the state of Israel against the Palestinians are non-existent.  It's a good thing there are independent human rights organizations like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Israel's own human rights organization Btselem to turn to get an unbiased perspective of who's committing what in that region, otherwise based on this video, one would not know that Israel has racist and discrimatory laws that violate Palestinian human rights, that Israelis actually kill multiple times more Palestinians than vice versa (including even more women and children than the Palestinians do), that Israel demolishes Paletinian homes to build Jewish only settlements, that Israel imprisons Palestinians without trial and tortures them to sign confessions that they don't even understand, etc., etc.  If you think I'm making this up, just visit Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, or btselem's websites and confirm for yourself.

If you're looking for a biased pro-Israeli perspective of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that hides Israel's faults and highlights Palestinian faults, this is the film for you.  If you're looking for a neutral understanding of the conflict, I highly recommend steering away from this film.",1156636800,8,1567,5.563025210084033
7987098,5,B00008V61V,"IT's a shame that in the 21st century, people cannot seem to understand that the Nazi tactics of the Nazis have been revived, now by Arabs and Palestinians. At least the Nazies disposed of the bodies. The Palestinians, however, leave the cleanup to their victims, whose survivors are left to pick up the cruel pieces of their lives.

No one is trying to vilify an entire people here. But the entire people should rebel against the Nazi propaganda that bombards them via the Palestinian Authority media, television and radio, day in and day out. Why are textbooks that teach JEws are vilains, and good only for killing okay?

These things are not okay, just as murdering Jews because they are JEws is not okay.

This is a film that provides the realistic situation of Jews in Israel today, afflicted by terrorism. To defeat the problem, defeat the terrorism, and the ideology that supports it.

Only then will the Palestinian people earn the right to statehood and democracy that they so rickly deserve. Their leaders--not the JEwish people--are to blame for all the horror.",1109894400,36,1073,4.8469945355191255
7987099,1,B00008V61V,"I was rather disappointed in this film -- it really didn't seem to offer anything new or insightful. Though I welcome Allen Estrin's obvious political position as his right, I would have been more happy if the film were more than just a series of things we already know about, told from an Israeli perspective. It might appeal to the so-called ""Israeli Left"", but not to US viewers who don't hold a personal stake in the Mid East conflict. Nothing to shout about.",1075248000,18,463,4.590361445783133
7987100,5,B00008V61V,"This is a documentary which gives the viewer a peek into the real Israeli heart of hearts.  No other country has gone through so much in such a short time, and emerged with such an optimistic outlook - based on faith in God and faith in their country as surviving Democracy.  Countless news reports show Arabs demonstrating their hatred against Israel.  But this
finding any indications that Israelis hate anyone is not an easy task.  News reports show several Israelis lying in the streets after being attacked by Arabs.  However, the world news media never track down the Israeli ""wounded bystanders"".  Were they to do this they would find these innocent Jews with nails in their brains, missing body parts, and psychological handicaps brought on by never ending unprovoked Arab hatred.  Yet the undaunted Israeli spirit shines forth as if to say to God ""we will pass your test this time"".  I am a Christian who is proud to love the Jews.",1067126400,93,940,4.7592592592592595
