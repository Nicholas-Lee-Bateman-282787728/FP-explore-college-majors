8045086,5,B00076ON4G,"Otogi Zoshi is less one 26 episode series and more two 13 episode series.  The first half takes place during Heian-era Japan and draws heavily from Japanese fairy tales.  The second half transports the characters we have come to know and love into the modern era, but manages to utterly fail at retaining the charm of the first half of the series.  Seriously, just buy the first half and pretend a second half was never made.",1208822400,,425,4.565789473684211
8045087,5,B00076ON4G,"I first saw the box for Otogi Zoshi a while ago and thinking that it would just be an anime based on the popular Xbox game I kept blowing it off.  When I finally decided to actually read what it was about I became intrigued and now I am borderline obsessed.  It has action which I will equate to that of Samurai Champloo (one of my favorites) and they have done their research as it shows quite beautifully.  Note: Otogi Zoshi are short prose fiction.  The characters are so vivid and have such captivating personalities.  I have to also say that this is the best depiction of Abe no Seimei that I have seen in anime.  To top it off they include lectures from Tokyo U to explain it all.  If you love Japan, its history, or just think you do, buy it.  If you love beautiful artwork, buy it.  And if you love a good story that doesn't always have a happy ending, buy it!",1128988800,4,868,4.180722891566265
8045088,5,B00076ON4G,"Otogi Zoshi is set during Japan's Heian Era (794-1185) and is equal parts action, drama, and intrigue. Kyoto, the capital of ancient Japan has become a corrupt and run-down city, filled with self serving nobles, and onmyoji who only care about gaining political power. In the meantime, the city is suffering from famine and widespread disease.

Minamoto no Raiko, a reknowned archer and samurai is sent to recover a legendary gem called the magatama said to hold the power to restore the capital. But Raiko has fallen ill so his younger sister, Hikaru secretly assumes his identity and goes in his place. She and her loyal bodyguard Tsuna later meet new companions and have many exciting and dangerous adventures on the quest for the legendary magatama.

The animation is gorgeous to look at and the storytelling is superlative filled with lots of complex and memorable characters. The producers made special attention to historical details as you can see in the extra features section.

If you are looking for a change of pace from standard anime fare, this is definitely the series to watch. The main character is similar to ""Kai Doh Maru"" which I also have, but definitely this story is WAY superior of the two.

I highly recommend Otogi Zoshi to all anime fans, it is one of the BEST anime series out there!",1128643200,3,1311,4.8133333333333335

8045090,5,B00076ON4G,"I own the first two volumes of this great series. I bumped into this hystorically based show in a store and looked at the box and thought I might like it. Having a Strong interest in hystorical anime I decided to bey it. And oh did I like it.

The character design and directing are amazing. The story strongly advances every episode and character development is strong. Emphasis in historical accuracy is seen throughout, though certain licences were taken for dramatic effect. For those of us not too informed Japanese history, the box comes with special features that explain the historical contexts involved.

As a fan of historically based Anime I am proud to have this in my collection.",1118707200,,692,4.80672268907563
8045091,5,B00076ON4G,"This is one of the most Japanese Animes I've seen in a long time. This sounds like an oxymoron and it is but Otogi Zoshi is based in Japan's historical past not a fantasy or science fiction past but the stuff of history texts. The events take place in the Heian perod; A time of great strife in Japan and a time when Japanese culture was starting to define itself from China.

 Otogi Zoshi has a historical sense of realism, the producers have really done their homework (A lecture by a Tokyo University Prof is included). Its plot is well developed and the charaters are well defined making Otogi Zoshi a great viewing experience.

And ofcourse the animation and music are first rate.

NOTE: You must watch this anime with it's original audio!",1114646400,5,744,4.571428571428571
8045092,5,B00076ON4G,"I first encountered this series by accident as a fansub, and was hooked immediately. Equal parts historical drama, love story, action/adventure, and visual masterpiece, this is a compelling and enthralling story of dedication, bravery, heroism, and the discovery of love. The soundtrack and the artwork are lush, the writing is strong, and the animation is superb.

My DVD just arrived in the mail today, so I have yet to check out the English voice talent...but be brave! It's not that hard to read the subtitles, and the Japanese voice work is excellent.

It's going on my shelf right next to the Miyazaki collection. An excellent anime for people who like animation but don't like giant robots, magical girls, or painfully cute fuzzy animals.",1112140800,19,745,5.048780487804878
