1084521,4,6305870160,"Two things happened on the way to what was meant to be a typically upbeat, light-hearted, happy-ending Disney production. First, they gave it a poignant, very human story-line: the difficulties a man and his daughter  have in coping with the traumatic death of his wife and her mother. Second,  they cast Lindsay Lohan as the thirteen year old daughter. The ability to  bring depth to a character in a lighthearted comedy is perhaps as much or  greater a challenge than in a serious drama (check out Roddy McDowell's  performance as the butler in ""Overboard""). Miss Lohan has  accomplished this twice in as many movie roles - or should I say three  times, considering the two subtly different personalities she carved out of  the twins in ""Parent Trap"". In ""Life-size"" she brought  life to a doll, but more important she brought life to what could easily  have been an adolescent stereotype. The control she has over her facial  expressions is fantastic. A light roll of the eyes, a krinkle at the corner  of her mouth, a guilty grin open up little windows that bring reality to  the heart of her character. It's worth the price of the video to experience  the sparkle of Tyra Banks, the sensitivity of Jere Burns, but most of all  to witness another example of Lindsay Lohan's masterful acting talent. Buy  it or rent it, but see ""Life Size"".",960336000,22,1343,4.724137931034483

It's a Disney movie, intended for kids I'm sure, but I enjoy it every bit as much as my daughter! It caught my attention from the very beginning and pretty much kept me glued to the screen until the end. And of course I had tears at the end, a couple of times throughout the movie actually, haha! Oh, the soundtrack is pretty catchy too. We always end up dancing to several of the songs. (I'm a silly mom who loves to make my kids laugh, if you can't tell by the fact that I'm enjoying a Disney movie so much!) And of course it has good lessons for the kids that are easy to come away with. The only downside is that the songs get stuck in your head! The movie is great though, and it came packaged brand new, plastic wrapped and all.",1473465600,,826,4.0426829268292686

1084902,5,6305870160,"This movie is hilarious and entertaining. It's funny because the humor is so narrow and simple; That's what makes it funny! Is because it's ""stupid"". It reminds me of an 80's comedy; you know the one's where something is odd or bizarre about the main character but the public and other character's 'don't get it'. These are my favorite types of movies. I guess you could label it as a Romantic comedy also. One of the most memorable moments was when Eve (Tyra Banks) sings 'Be a Star', how can anyone not love that? I was cracking up the entire movie. So Tyra Banks plays Lindsay Lohan's barbie doll that comes to life, they go shopping, hang out in the city and do all the daily tasks that us humans do. The object of the game is to not let the cat out of the bag; that Eve (Tyra) is a barbie doll that's come to life. Does Eve have what it takes to function in society and blend in like a functioning human being. Order this film to find out lol

1084974,4,6305870160,"Our whole family enjoyed this light film that deals with the real pain of loss in a family, while simultaneously raising - possibly for the first time for children - the question of: what does it mean to be human?

The first thing I had to tell my children when we were watching this together is ""this is just silly....this isn't real, it is just a story, but let's try to find out what the story is trying to say..."" The plot follows the adventures of sad and self-isolating Casey (Lindsay Lohan) a few years after her mother's death (never explained, only a ""check up"" and then a swift decline is alluded to)who attempts to resurrect her mother, but instead brings an unwanted doll named Eve (Tyra Banks) to life. Eve is delighted to encounter use of her skin and senses but eventually realizes through a series of painfully obvious failures that she is not the perfect role model her manufacturers have created a fantasy of. Casey despises Eve and has eliminated any chance of bringing her mother back to life. But as Eve grows from her failures, she and Casey develop a dialogue about the human condition that paradoxically helps them both to ""let go and grow."" Casey's father (Jere Burns) has buried his grief in ambition at his workplace, where he hopes to be made partner, neglecting Casey. But again, Eve's presence forces him to make emotional choices and he begins to reconnect with his daughter.

The most mature theme - correctly in context for children - is the paradox of the pain, stress and disappointments of  life, that simultaneously helps us to grow.

Jere Burns is correctly cast as a modern, hip, ambitious Dad, and successfully carries off the mixture of trying to encourage his daughter to accept her loss of her Mother, hile also obviously suppressing his own unresolved feelings on the episode as well.

Tyra Banks gives a stunning performance as a doll come to life (and life size) who exhibits the false confidence of the Dunning-Kruger Effect while meanwhile stumbling through real human tasks like a ditzy ""blonde"" cubed. I was very impressed by Ms. Banks performance, for she several times executes very well, and believably, what a doll might think of an ordinary human activity with a vague sense of comprehension, and fear of the unknown.

In her pre-wild child days Lindsey Lohan's appeal was obviously limited to the freckled red head tom boy stereotype so familiar in so many Disney films. Here she does a credible job.

Let me close with a full-disclosure and a discussion about one of the more troubling aspects of the film: Casey's use of witchcraft to resurrect her mother (instead bringing Eve to life). Disney films have ""magic"" in them frequently, scaling from cartoonish (Fantasia) to diabolical (Snow White). On that scale of order of one to ten to me this scores a six, but it is a bit difficult to see in a live action film.

We are a pious traditionalist Catholic family, and recognize that such a plot device could cause rejection of the film by fellow Catholics and observant pious Protestants alike. Based on my limited knowledge of ""occult"" practices Casey's ""altar"" and symbols and collection of significant objects, and spell casting book are all at a level of believability higher than the obvious cartoonishness of Disneyland's ""Haunted Mansion."" For me, for a light comedy, this was unnecessary. Yet, my children took little interest in this dimension of the plot, and in our discussion of the film afterwards both said it was ""silly"" and knew that it was just a made-up device to get the doll to ""real life"" so the story could be told.
My conclusion: it is all-in-all harmless, it was unnecessarily ""real,"" but parents who actively discuss with their children about what it is they see should have no problem guiding them past this plot point. For those parents who just plop their kids in front of the tube and absorb whatever...well...there has probably already been too much damage already done for this to even register.",1247356800,6,3983,4.8043795620437955

When Drew tries to perform the ritual, he accidentally brings Eve to life. Eve is incredibly hot and doesn't know too much about the real world.

1084991,1,6305870160,"You can hear the moans from Walt Disney's grave every time someone plays this movie.

There's a reason why Disney thought it would be a brilliant idea to put this on DVD and sell it: it's SO completely different than all the other safe, suburban movies they play at nauseous on the Disney Channel. 'Life Size' is more edgy! It has occult situations, single parent family, scantily-cad super models, and middle aged adults dancing really badly. This movie also embraces cultural awareness by showing that black Barbie dolls can be all the rage in the middle of the suburbs.

All sarcasm aside, it is okay for a children's movie to have intelligence. Disney should probably invest in that in the future. I am quite tired of the low-budget [...] that they are producing nowadays. And by the way, all the things I listed above actually happen in this movie.

1085043,5,6305870160,"Casey Stewart (Lindsay Lohan, The Parent Trap) is having a tough teenage life. Her mother has recently passed away, and her father, Ben (Jere Burns) is always busy. He always tries to make it to her football games, but he always misses them. Casey feels that the answer to all her problems would be to bring her mother back to life.
Casey is given a birthday gift by Ben's co-worker, Drew (Anne Marie Loder), and the gift is an Eve doll which doesn't really interest Casey. When Casey tries to cast a spell to bring her mother back to life, she accidentaley brings back to life the Eve doll. Now, Eve (Tyra Banks, Halloween: Resurrection) is a human with the thoughts of a doll. Casey thinks this is terrible...but it gets even worse when she realizes that her dad has gotten a crush on the doll.
LIFE-SIZE is such an entertaining movie. It is a great movie for the entire family. Not only was there an excellent script, but the actors were wonderful--especially Lindsay Lohan and Tyra Banks. Each scene was full of humor, especially when Eve was a complete idiot. Despite the comedy of the movie, the end was very sad and could make anyone cry.

Also, Eve seems a bit abnoxious until the end of the film, but she, too, passes, largely because of Lindasy Lohan's wonderful job supporting her throughout the picture.
