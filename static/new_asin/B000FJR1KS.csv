8123714,1,B000FJR1KS,"I bought the Boss gt-8 at Guitar Center used, by the way the pedal is great but you need to "" GO TO SCHOOL"" to learn how to use it, I'm agree with somebody's review, why Boss don't make a video and that way we don't have to follow that guy in YouTube selling the DVD which doesn't  seams intuitive at all.",1468022400,,305,3.9193548387096775
8123715,2,B000FJR1KS,"If you are a new user of the GT-8 and do not like to read this video might help you. But as for anyone that has owned the GT-8 for awhile and has already messed around with assigning, naming and adjusting patches don't bother with this tutorial. This Tutorial does not go into any detail of sound adjustments worth the price of this tutorial. There are no demonstrations worth any value when the guy in the video actually does pick up a guitar.
  So, if you looking for help with different sounds, this video is not the answer. For me the best part of the video was the demo. I gave 2 stars because it does have some explanation of how to assign the expression pedal. But there are no wiring diagrams or demonstration for effects looping. In my opinion this should have been a free video when you made your purchase of the GT-8. Plain and simple I do not believe this tutorial is worth the cost.",1329436800,,895,4.321428571428571
8123716,1,B000FJR1KS,"no explanation at all... just switching and turning knobs and reading. The guys just keeps laughing and saying everytime he hits and turn knobs how wonderfull things you just might do with that. Lack of explanation, he doesnt even do examples with a guitar. In the video he just has a fender squier in a stand doin nothing. everything he is telling, it might be figured out by you... i mean, by turning knobs i can also read what the displays says... I don't need him to that...it doesnt help you at all...",1266278400,,506,4.451612903225806
8123717,1,B000FJR1KS,"This may be a good video and all. It may teach you all the things to do with it but why wouldn't boss just throw the DVD in with your GT-8. As much as it is already. First I got to get the pedal board, then my power adapter breaks so I gotta get a new one, and now when I get the power adapter I can't even figure out how the thing works so I have to buy a DVD to figure out how to work it? It may be a good piece but there is just a ton of things extra that Boss never tells you about. But I have not seen the video and the stars I gave it do not reflect on the video this is just my frustration with Boss's hidden costs.",1219881600,,622,3.5474452554744524
8123718,4,B000FJR1KS,"This is a very complex piece of equipment,( GT-8 ) I for one am not very tech savy. This video is helpful, along with the owners manual, I can get the effects desired. Even with the video's help, time is required to get all possible out of the Boss GT-8's potential. I do recommend the product for those who could use the extra help with their GT-8.",1204156800,2,349,4.223880597014926
8123719,5,B000FJR1KS,The Boss GT-8 is rather easy to operate and the DVD just make it easier to learn all its main features. I warmely recommend it.,1203292800,,127,4.12
