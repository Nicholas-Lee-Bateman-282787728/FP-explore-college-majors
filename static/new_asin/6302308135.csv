453323,4,6302308135,"B-Westerns could be silly but they usually looked terrific, with great photography, great locations and great horsemanship -- that's why they're so delightful to watch in good Blu-ray editions.  This one has the added benefit of Louise Brooks, the iconic silent film star, in her last screen role.  I enjoyed it a lot.  The Olive Films Blu-ray editions of B-Westerns are a bit overpriced for such short movies, but if you love B-Westerns you probably won't complain too much.",1360022400,3,475,4.987341772151899
453324,5,6302308135,"This is a must for us b-western fans! The three mesqueteers was a serial running in the thirties and early forties and had many different actors playing the mesqueteers. Here it is Max Terhune, Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan and John Wayne before rising to mega stardom. The film is well-made, funny and loaded with loveable heavies and henchmen. The best is that the picture is knife sharp so you enjoy every second. It is from a company called Olivefilms and I am certainly going to see what more they have got in store.",1358035200,,512,4.576086956521739

453326,5,6302308135,"I just love the Wayne ""3 Mesquiteers"" films.  The music in all 8 is the same and different than all other Mesquiteer films.  A little silly at times, but plain clean fun watching.  Have watched each one many times and have put the music on CD and listen in the car on long trips.  Makes me feel like I'm still a kid watching them on Saturday morning.  Now collecting them on DVD as they come out.",1356220800,,396,4.157894736842105

453328,4,6302308135,I just received this and the other three new BR discs from the John Wayne Three Mesquiteers era. The Amazon.com review of the story almost takes longer to read than the movie is long. I'm just kidding but its a 56 minute film as they all are and I surmise the reason they are on separate discs and so expensive is because the market is small. On all films the picture quality is sharp and stunning at times and the sound is robust. These are fun films and its a hoot to see young Duke riding a big white horse with his oversized white hat. Some of the horse chase scenes in all the films is really stirring as the camera is just ahead of the horses and to see them charging at full speed in HD is pretty cool. These are sort of silly/stupid scripts and sadly Duke Wayne isn't the main star...he is co starring so he's not on camera as much as I'd like but I am a fan and am glad I picked them up. This will be my review for all four films as they were all made within a couple year period all directed by the same man and all pretty enjoyable with their own quirkiness. I just wanted to let folks know that they are a quality presentation and the covers are retro cool with original graphics also displayed on the BR disc itself.,1349827200,10,1229,4.1037344398340245
453329,4,6302308135,"Republic Pictures presents ""OVERLAND STAGE RAIDERS"" (20 September 1938) (54 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- The series was based on a series of western novels by William Colt MacDonald, which began with ""Law of the .45's"" in 1933 --- The Three Mesquiteers is the umbrella title for a series of 51 western B-movies released between 1936 and 1943, including 8 films starring John Wayne --- The name was a play on The Three Musketeers, and each film featured a trio of stars --- The series blended the traditional Western period with more modern elements, which was not unknown with other B-Western films and serials --- Towards the end of the series, during World War II, the trio of cowboys were opposing Nazis --- The Three Mesquiteers series was extremely popular at the time of its release --- The series was the only one of its kind to be specifically named and ranked in contemporary polls of the top western film stars --- For example, from 1937 to the end of the series in 1943, The Motion Picture Herald consistently ranked the series in its top ten, reaching a peak of 5th place in 1938, when a pre-Stagecoach John Wayne was the series lead

Our story line and plot, Our heroes Stony Brooke (John Wayne), Tucson Smith (Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan) and Lullaby Joslin (Max Terhune) members of the Three Mesquiteers decide with the stage being held up regularly an airplane would be better so they get the ranchers to sell their cattle and invest in the new airline --- But when a gold shipment goes out, the stage line owner has his men hijack the plane. The pilot discharges the gas causing a forced landing and the Mesquiteers must now find the missing plane and recover the gold --- Second of the ""Three Mesquiteers"" series, the plot is intriguing for its ingenuity --- Who would expect to go to a Saturday matine and see a second billed western that involves the tactical integration of aerial spotting in defense of overland lines of communication, communications deception, gas hand grenades used to defend an improvised landing strip, parachuting cowboys and passengers, the hijacking and retaking of a cattle train, a talking ventriloquist's dummy in flight gear, and an in-flight robbery -- all within less than an hour ---  Oh yes, Louise Brooks plays the sister of the pilot --- Brooks had retired from the screen that same year after completing one last film, the John Wayne western Overland Stage Raiders in which she played the romantic lead with a long hairstyle that rendered her all but unrecognizable from her ""Lulu"" days --- The film is notable for being the final film in which silent film icon Louise Brooks performed.

the cast includes:
John Wayne ...  Stony Brooke
 Ray Corrigan ...  Tucson Smith
 Max Terhune ...  Lullaby Joslin
 Louise Brooks ...  Beth Hoyt
 Anthony Marsh ...  Ned Hoyt

 Dirk Thane ...  Dutch, Eastern gangster

Special footnote -- The 32 year old John Wayne was fortunate enough to have talented writers around him to write novels that could be adapted into vehicles for his career, as well as short stories and screenplays that would immortalise him as the American hero --- This film is one such example --- When you watch this film you're not watching it for the story (like you would do in 'Rio Grande' or 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance'), you're watching it to see John Wayne in action --- He is the romantic embodiment of what it was like for the settling community to live in the post-civil war era --- Despite the fact that most of these westerns distort history, what Wayne delivers gives you access to his humanity --- That's what we like about him.

453330,2,6302308135,"i do believe this was louise brooks' last movie after returning to hollywood after making a few very good movies in europe(""lulu"" and ""pandora's box"").  this movie was to have been her punishment for leaving hollywood. always a free spirit, she said ""so long"" to hollywood after this, fading into obscurity before rediscovery in the 1960's.

i love old B westerns but ones like this were modern day is mixed with olden day is just to tough to take",1178409600,2,447,4.6455696202531644
453331,1,6302308135,"I would have never expected this from a fairly major manufacturer (their Betty Boop box set is superb), but this 54 minute film was duplicated/manufactured in 6 hr EP mode; as such the picture is dreadful. Louise Brooks deserves better.",1147564800,6,236,4.925
453332,3,6302308135,"Grade B Western starring a very young John Wayne.  The Three Mesquiteers take time out from punching cattle and go into the transport business.  The bad guys running the local stage-line take issue with their potential loss  of business, and try to sabotage our heroes' enterprising efforts.  This is  one of those old Western movies that confuses the Old West with modern  times (circa. 1938).  The cowboys wear boots, carry guns, and ride horses,  just as usual.  But the Oro Grande Stage Company ""stagecoach"" is  really a bus.  Besides that, there are radios and telephones around town.  Even more shocking, the new express company that the Mesquiteers help  establish is really an airline!  They only have one airplane, but, by  golly, it's an airline!  This creates an amusing ""other worldly""  quality that takes some adjustment time for the unwary viewer.  One scene  shows John Wayne unloading gas cans from a mule pack train and gassing the  grounded airplane while standing on the wing in full cowboy regalia.  Incongruities aside, the movie features an entertaining mixture of  cliff-hanging Western adventure and light humor.  There are enough roaring  six-guns and black hearted villains to satisfy the ten-year old kid in all  of us.  Don't think about it, just saddle up and ride, pardner.",964742400,8,1303,5.056872037914692

453338,3,6302308135,John Wayne and full film restoration help this one. Sadly this was the heroine's last film appearance. Louise Brooks was a major star in the twenties and early thirties. Her career nose dived because she allegedly could not get alone with the Studio Brass. She is thought by many to be the prettiest actress of her day. She could also act and had an infectious energy that came across well on the screen. It is too bad Republic Studios did not take full advantage of her talents in this film.,1414800000,2,492,4.477777777777778

453345,4,6302308135,"During my formative years growing up in Indianapolis, my 2 brothers and I huddled around the TV beginning early Saturday morning to swallow up everything the 3 channels (NBC, CBS, ABC) had on.  Besides cartoons, films were serials like ""Flash Gordon"" or horror movies like ""Son of Dracula."" Of course there were westerns.  One of my favorites was the series of short films called ""The Three Mesquiteers.""  From 1936 to 1943, Republic Pictures made 51 of these `B' movies, eight of which starred John Wayne.  These films got him a leading role in a 1939 movie called ""Stagecoach"" and the rest is history.

This was the second ""Mesquiteers"" film he made and it is pretty standard fare for the time.  Essentially, a lot of galloping horses, throwing lead and beating up bad guys with one punch.  As much as I enjoyed those movies then and now, the real reason I bought this Blu ray edition was to catch Louis Brooks in her last role at the age of 32.  Brooks' career is mostly seen in the 23 or so silent films she was in.  She was beautiful, talented and I have been admittedly smitten.  That is another story however.  Here she is just fine as the potential romantic interest with Wayne's character Stony Brooke.

Beth (Brooks) and her brother Ned (Anthony Marsh) own a small plane.  Yes, this is a western but one that bridges the gap between horses & mules with planes, buses and telephones.  After the local bus company is robbed several times of the cash box of the local bank, Stony and his 2 sidekicks, Tucson Smith (Ray Corrigan) and Lullaby Joslin (Max Terhune) convince the locals that flying cash and gold out on a plane would be safer.  But Beth and Ned need a newer plane that will also fly passengers.  The threesome convince the local ranchers to put up their herds of cattle to finance the plane.

The bad guys led by a town official must change their plans in order to heist the gold.  You can't get too critical of these movies.  They don't make much sense.  One minute the good guys are shooting it out with the black hats, then the next, they are throwing lassoes around them.  What happened, run out of bullets?  In any case, the film is fun to watch.  Ms. Brooks, even with longer hair than her iconic page boy, performs well in her subordinate role.  After this $300 gig, her next job was as a clerk at Saks.  Such a waste.

The Blu ray version of the film is distributed by Olive Films.  It comes with the original 1.37:1 aspect ratio and is in crisp 1080p black and white.  While it doesn't look like a full restoration was done here, I have no complaints.  A few edit glitches are evident and a couple streaks, but really no big deal.  The audio is just fine as well with a DTS-HD Master Audio Mono, the sound spreads out evenly across the front speakers.  It is clear and properly centered.  Alas, there are no extras.  None.  Collectors of Wayne, Brooks or ""The Three Mesquiteers"" series will want this one.",1386547200,,2933,4.492424242424242
