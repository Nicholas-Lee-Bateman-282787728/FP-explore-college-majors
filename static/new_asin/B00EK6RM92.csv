5924741,5,B00EK6RM92,"You'll be glad to hear that nearly all of the bonus content from the previously released DVDs and Blu-rays has been ported over here. (See individual titles for details; with the exception of Casino Royale, the discs in the box set are the same as the individual releases.) In total, it amounts to over 120 hours of audio commentary, behind-the-scenes featurettes, retrospective documentaries, and in-depth interviews. There is just so much content here it would be hard to know what to do with all of it.

One thing you won't get with this release is a ""Mission Control"" DVD, this wasn't a big deal and you won't miss it. Also Inside: Die Another Day documentary by Charles de Lauzirika. Oh and the Casino Royale disc included here mixes material from the original Blu-ray and the 2008 re-release. Included are Deleted Scenes, The Road to Casino Royale, Ian Fleming's Incredible Creation, James Bond in the Bahamas, Ian Fleming: Secret Road to Paradise, Death in Venice, Becoming Bond, James Bond for Real, and Chris Cornell Music Video. Unfortunately, we lose the forty-minute Bond Girls Are Forever and four featurettes--Chasing A Plane: From Storyboard to Screen, The Art of the Freerun, Storyboard Sequence: Freerun Chase, and Filmmaker Profiles.

The set also contains an exclusive bonus disc, but there's not much of substance on it:
World of Bond: Title Sequences (1080p, 1:02:32): You can watch the title sequences in a row!
World of Bond: Gadgets (1080p, 3:03): A montage of Bond's most memorable gadgetry.
World of Bond: Villains (1080p, 2:22): A quick introduction to all of Bond's antagonists.
World of Bond: Bond Girls (1080p, 1:24): Probably the most watched montage of them all.
World of Bond: Locations (1080p, 1:40): A quick tour through the exotic locales featured in the Bond franchise.
World of Bond: Bond in Motion (1080p, 1:43): All of Bond's vehicles through the years.
Skyfall Videoblogs (1080p, 10:51): A collection of hype-building promo material for the upcoming Bond film. Includes Skyfall: Behind the Scenes, Sam Mendes, Naomie Harris, Berenice Marlohe, Production Update from Shanghai, Dennis Gassner Takes Us Inside the Look of Skyfall, and Jany Temime on Dressing 007 for Action.
Designing 007: Fifty Years of Bond Style (1080p, 4:01): Curator Bronwyn Cosgrave guides us through a retrospective exhibition looking at all 23 Bond films from a all-around design perspective, from architecture to costumes and props. Here you'll see models, set sketches, and an up-close look at the famous golden gun.
Being Bond (1080p, 3:08): Each of the six Bond actors say a few words about playing the iconic role. Sourced from vintage interviews.

I really like the dvd case arrangement but it certainly isn't for everybody. inside of the set are two books. a) 1962-1981 and b) 1983-2012. The pages on the left feature promo images and stills, while the right pages hold two discs each. The discs glide in and out easily and do not seem to impart scratches on discs.

Overall I would say that this is a perfect set for a bond fan. You can always nitpick but it is nice to see a franchise be well supported.",1378944000,88,3125,5.003846153846154

Could have done without them in a collectors edition. That's why I pay the extra dollar. In comparison, the Spectre Blu-ray has an awful audio mix: quiet dialogue with overly loud action.

5924759,5,B00EK6RM92,"Got the set for $99 for Black Friday deal... It was over $200, maybe $250 before clack friday deals. There is a lot of James Bond movies that I have not seen... Which is kind of shameful LOL, because I was born in the mid-eighties... But now I have all of them in HD with over maybe a thousand hours of extra content... this set is worth it, whether it's $200, you can watch the best movies all men and women talk about ever time one came out.

And I see now the price is $118, that's an amazing price, the price went down (I bought mine 2.5 years ago)

The quality of picture and sound is amazing and upgraded and it must of took a lot of work because it's that good!!!! The sound, especially if you have a 2.1 or 5.1 setup at your home, you can really get into the movie with the intense sharp enhanced sound.

James Bond fans, this box set is approved by me, zi recommend it for sure and who doesn't want ever James Bond Movie on hand, in Blu Ray!?",1462320000,,951,4.047872340425532

That being said, I hate this packaging. all movies come in two books. the books will fall apart. probably almost every time you open it. I ordered a replacement when one ripped the 1st time I opened it. With the replacement  I treated it like fine crystal. The first book started breaking before I could watch all the movies in it.

YOU ARE BETTER OFF BUYING THEM INDIVIDULLY OR IN THE 3-4 MOVIES SETS THEY MAKE NOW.  I REGRET PURCHASEING THIS SET. I DO NOT REGRET BUYING THE MOVIES.",1459123200,2,556,4.378640776699029

5924771,5,B00EK6RM92,"All the bonds in one expect the new one they just made. And Never say never with Sean Connery and the 1967 version of Casino Royale those 2 you have to order separate. I don't know they just didn't put them in with this collection. Casino Royale with the dvd release date of 2002 should have the 1954 version on there as well the very fist Bond movie black and white though. So to have every bond movie you order this collection with almost everyone. Then order Never say never with Sean Connery, 1967 version of Casino Royale 2002 is suppose to 1954 version on it as well. And the new one Spectre  there are 2 more that are hard to find and probably expensive as well. The 1954 version of Casino Royale and OPERATION DOUBLE 007 don't think thats on dvd or blu ray. Other names for OPERATION DOUBLE 007 are Operation Kid Brother and O.K. Connery. Sean Connery's brother is in that one, but it isn't available.",1455580800,,909,4.378698224852071

5924773,5,B00EK6RM92,"Another great movie package that's worth every penny. So far, I've watched from DR. NO to On Her Majesty's Secret Service with the audio commentaries and the extras for each film. The picture is breath taking and plays crystal clear.",1455148800,,233,4.85
5924774,3,B00EK6RM92,"This 3 star score does not reflect upon the films themselves. All 23 movies are as enjoyable as I remember (more so in HD), and played just fine in my machines. The packaging is the focus of this review. All of the discs fit in their slots very tightly. I found it impossible to lift any of them high enough to get a finger under to pull them out, and had to resort to using whatever improvised tool I could find to pry the edge of the disc up so I could get a grip on it. Every time I did this, and had to wipe off the big fat fingerprint that I made when grabbing the disc. Prying the discs up enough to get a finger under resulted in an audible ripping sound nearly every time. That sound was the artwork covers separating from the thick card stock that give the pages of the book their rigidity. Several pages separated entirely, and I had to glue them back down, because there was nothing left to hold the discs in place after separation had occurred. On top of the cheap gluing, the large odd-sized box makes it impossible for this collection to sit nicely beside the rest of your blu ray collection if you are using a media shelf like I do (they are barely deep enough for a standard movie case. All of the movies are great, and the discs play fine. I am happy to finally own the whole collection on blu ray. Previously, I had an incomplete collection that was a mixture of vhs and dvd. If you are going to spend the money on the blu ray collection, get one of the newer sets that comes in the 3 multi-disc, blue plastic cases. You won't have to fight to get your movies out without destroying the packaging, and it will look nicer on a shelf with other blu rays.",1455062400,4,1670,4.173374613003096

5924794,5,B00EK6RM92,"Bond 50 is a remarkable collection and the remastering is especially nice. Yesterday the ""Ultimate Bond"" collection came out as a Deal of the Day. The chief difference from Bond 50 is making all 23 movies available digitallly through Ultraviolet at no extra charge in addition to the Blu-ray discs. I wonder if the current Blu-ray versions may (or can) be remastered or upscaled to ultra-high definition.

As you wouldn't be looking at this unless you were already a James Bond fan, I won't extol the qualities of such a fun film series.  Quite simply this is a great set for any level of Bond Fan. It's great for those serious fans, as well as those fans that enjoy movies and extras, but wouldn't necessarily value an extensive set of bonus features.

Great purchase for anyone that can be considered a fan of James Bond, and all the quality actors that have played him over the years. Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Rodger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig. Each movie has its own merits and flaws, but it's the actors that keep us coming back for another Bond Movie, even after 50 years. The good news, 90% of the time the movies meet up to or exceed the expectations of fans of both Bond and the actor portrayer.

5924823,4,B00EK6RM92,"The films are great. I have watched the first four and so far the image, colour and sound are fantastic. I would have given the set five stars but it would appear the packaging was chosen more for marketing purposes than for protection of the disks or ease of storage. I do not care for any packaging where the playing surface of the disk comes into direct contact with the surface of the holder and that is the case for all the disks in this set. Each disk slides into a tight slot on the pages of the two book format holders resulting in the playing surface making direct contact with the paper backing both when removing and replacing a disk as well as while it is in the case. Over time, and especially with repeated use, chances are probably good that dust particles will end up on either case or the disk surface and the result will be a scratched disk. Also, given the size of the case (10.75"" x 7"" x 1.5""), if you store your DVDs on a made for DVD type of shelf you will find it difficult or impossible to store this collection there.",1443657600,,1042,4.241206030150754

5924851,2,B00EK6RM92,"Bond watchers beware- buy this only for the disks. The nice box which holds them is VERY poorly made. The disks are in nice displayable pouches in the box-which makes them easily accessible and neatly displayed...however, this box set was incredibly poorly assembled. Today I opened up the 1960s box for the second time, and the glue of one of the sheets came undone. This means that if the book is opened,the first two disks immediately fall out. Now, everything else is fine and the disks are nice....but now I have a few choices. Try to open up the book from the back,  take all of the disks out of the collectable box set package, or risk ruining the first two movies every time I want to watch any of them...I have bought many blu Ray box sets, and frankly, this is by far the worst. Now, I love bond and the movies are great, but honestly, I didn't pay this much money to risk ruining two classics every time I want to watch one because they decided to make a garbage box. It really does the bond brand a huge disservice to put something like this on the shelves. Please take this into account if you are on the fence about purchasing. I highly recommend these movies, but you may end up losing a few if you plan on storing them in the box set packaging.",1436572800,,1260,4.3164556962025316

As shown it's a long book with 2 DVDs a page. Each page is cardboard with a heavy paper overlay to hold the DVDs in. Sadly the idiot that designed the holders left the center hole covered and only one finger slot on the side to get the DVD out. Two of the three pages so far have delaminated while getting the DVDs out of the front slot. Once delaminated handle carefully or the DVD(s) will fall out until you snug them back into the box...a pain in the neck.
After 4 DVDs, I have found nothing described in other posts about sound or color. They look/sound like the originals (so far)

5924932,4,B00EK6RM92,"I've always been a James Bond fan and have previously purchased partial collections and individual films, but have never managed to buy the rest of the collection before they are discontinued.  It was great being able to get them all at once and in Blu-ray as well.  All of the discs were in excellent condition and I did not experience any issues reading them in my Blu-ray player.

While the packaging for this collection looks nice, I would have rather seen something more compact that would fit on my DVD shelves.  Instead, I need to store this separately which makes it inconvenient when I want to watch 007.  Also, the discs are stored in cardboard sleeves where the opening is the size and shape of the disc with a small finger notch to help you get a grip on the disc.  It is sometimes difficult to get the disc out without having to flex the disc or rip the cardboard sleeve.  More often than not, I end up sticking the edge of the disc under the cardboard so I can't pull up on it to slide it out.",1425859200,,1007,4.324468085106383

5924935,3,B00EK6RM92,"This set has remarkable special features and the mastering on Blu ray looks stunning. The older films really come to life while still maintaining the aesthetic integrity that it originally had. My only gripe is the way the discs are held in this set. If you're a collector, and really take care of your discs, you're going to have a hard time taking the discs out of the sleeves. It's very difficult and one of the main reasons why I don't typically prefer to buy box sets like this. Other than that...it's great.",1425772800,,513,4.526881720430108

The only small quibble is with the blu ray for Quantum of Solace. There were not any new special features for the box set. It seems like they took the ones they already had and stuck them into the box set. Same with Skyfall.

Seeing the exotic places and action in Blu Ray quality is worth the money. The older movies are so much different than what we are used to seeing on DVD.

I started by watching You Only Live Twice and I was blown away by the quality. It's a 1967 movie that looks like it was filmed with today's cameras.

There's not much else to really review about this. It comes with a fancy book layout that holds the movies in chronological order. So if you want to take advantage of the iconic places 007 goes, the fancy cars, and all the action scenes, it's worth seeing them in Blu Ray quality.",1422057600,,737,4.183098591549296

so whats good, whats bad, whats ugly, whats new, whats missing?
KEVIN HARPER runs his expert ears and eyes over the new BOND 50 Blu-ray sets from both sides of the Atlantic to give 007 MAGAZINE readers the most comprehensive review available.

""BOND 50 celebrating five decades of James Bond 007
The UK Blu-ray set is a mixed bag containing most of what has already been released with a mere 15 minutes of completely new material added. As a Bond fan who has purchased the films in every format from VHS video, through laserdisc, DVD and now Blu-ray, I am now resigned to the fact that I have to double, treble and quadruple dip to get my favourites in the best available format. The previous Ultimate Edition DVD versions (from where the Lowry Digital Images restored video masters for all but the two most recent films in the BOND 50 set originate) were far from perfect, or indeed ultimate. The original UK release in August 2006 highlighted some unfortunate errors which have for the most part been corrected in the new Blu-ray releases. The Bond films started being released in the new high definition format from 2008. 11 titles have so far been released individually on Blu-ray with two of those (The Man With The Golden Gun and Licence To Kill) only being available in the US and certain European countries. With the bankruptcy of MGM the series was put on hold, so Bond fans had an incomplete series of films. The new BOND 50 box set uses exactly the same discs for the titles already released rather than re-authoring new titles to match the new ones being added to this collection. Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace were also previously released individually on Blu-ray, with Daniel Craigs first outing as 007 being subsequently reissued in a Deluxe Edition with new extra features. The version of Casino Royale included in the UK BOND 50 set is now completely uncut and adds most of the extra content from the Deluxe Edition (this was not originally advertised as being included on BOND 50 and appears to have been an afterthought). However, in order to fit all of this material on one disc, the Martin Campbell/Michael G. Wilson picture-in-picture video commentary has been dropped, and the extras downgraded to standard definition. So hang on to your Deluxe Edition if you want these features or to see John Corks superbly produced documentaries in high definition. The Quantum of Solace disc in the UK BOND 50 set is identical to the original release so features a different menu to the other films in the series. Consequently this disc is coded Region B only, so any US purchasers wanting the uncut Casino Royale (the film is still re-edited on the US version of BOND 50) will be unable to play Quantum of Solace without a multi-region player. All discs with the exception of Quantum of Solace are region free.""

My wife purchased it.  The collection includes 23 DVDs beginning with Dr. Know (1962) and culiminating with SkyFall (2012).  But when I opened the box, I was delightfully surprised to find two beautifully packaged albums in which the DVDs are stored that provide hard cover libraries for the discs with yeardates and color portraits of the Bond girls that appeared in each movie.  Finally, a James Bond boxed collection that every Bond lover will treasure.",1419897600,,616,5.0

The discs are difficult to pull out of them and don't seem very protected, I see them getting scratched very easily but in and out of the case frequently.  I was trying to pull one of the discs out and the pages (which are two pages glued together to create the front and back) came apart.  Now the discs on those pages are loose and slide out.

5 stars for the movies, 2 stars for the casing.",1419638400,20,682,4.1679389312977095

5925102,5,B00EK6RM92,"Its great to have the whole collection of Bond films available for Movie Marathon night!  I was absolutely stunned at the resolution of the films.  I also admit to having forgotten how things used to be.  Seeing Sean Connery slap a woman a on the bottom, to have actors refer to women as ""broads"" and see everyone smoke everywhere, reminds me of a bygone time that I'm glad is gone.  But the films are really terrific to watch again.  ""No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die...""",1409443200,,472,4.379310344827586
5925103,4,B00EK6RM92,"As an avid bond fan I already had this collection on DVD however as tech has moved on I wanted to get these again in Blu Ray. I can say that this really is one of the best ways (short of having your own cinema) to watch these movies. The soundtracks (DTS HD Master) sound fantastic with some decent speakers, amp and sub. The picture quality is fantastic on most of the movies with Skyfall being of absolutely pristine quality. Casino Royale and other new ones come close but again all depends on the original transfer. There one bad transfer that stood out for me was Goldfinger, the scene when bond is on the table with the laser, there is a cutaway to Goldfingers bad guys which looks of very low quality which is a shame.

So again not fantastic quality on all transfer but for most (say 90% of collection) was above expectations.

These sets go on sale for 99 at Amazon so watch out for those as you really cannot beat this price for a great collection in Blu Ray like this. Certainly cheaper than buying digitally (that can be at 15 dollars or more each !) and with higher bitrate, better sound tracks and the luxury of owning the disc.

I marked this as a 4 because the first set I received had a bad disc (For Your Eyes Only). After I repurchased a new set and returned the original I am pleased to say each disc was perfect.

Again this is a great collection so if you like the bond movies this is the one to have. Sit back, turn the lights down, the sounds up and enjoy !",1409356800,,1481,4.222614840989399

Cons are
NO Times for how long the movies are
No Booklets for the movies like the Box sets for the Dvd box sets
Poor Glue which does come off when you open it and the Blue Ray dics might come out
The Information on the back that is stuck with Glue Does not stick on very well,
The box set might just come off all together and each booklet can come apart
Sound Quality on the movies is not so great like they copied them right off DVD

The recordings are great, the sound fabulous.
There is no point in reviewing the individual movies which have been done umpteen times. The transition between Sean Connery and Roger Moore via On Her Majesty's Secret Service shows how the tenor of the series changed to a more gentle humorous series. Alas, the beginnings of most of the movies have no ultimate connection with the narrative. Surprisingly before Daniel Craig brought more realism to the series, both Timothy Dalton (3 movies) and Pierce Brosnan (4 movies) perform admirably. I particularly enjoyed The Living Daylight and The World is Not enough. It is interesting to note that all the titles which were coming from Ian Fleming now stopped until the revival of Casino Royale. For a change, the basic story follows the Fleming first book to a T with obligatory additions and alterations.
I haven't yet looked at the extra disc. No matter, this is a MUST for all Bond fans. Great packaging.",1403136000,,1107,4.8936170212765955

The packaging uses a cardboard slot booklet to store the discs. It scratches the discs and requires fingerprints on the read surface to even get them out of the slots.

The 23-movie Bond collection cardboard slots are however slightly improved over the Twilight BD box set. Cardboard, no matter how fancy, is still bad for the discs.

To the movie manufacturers, please quit subjecting our discs to cardboard.

5925182,4,B00EK6RM92,"I've always been a Bond fan.  I have lots of good memories of watching Bond with my dad when one of the films or various Bond-a-thons were on TV, but up to now, never purchased one of the collections.  This one was a Deal of the Day not so long ago, and as such, was a great price, but its regular price is still highly reasonable, at around 5 and a half bucks per film.

Bond is ubiquitous enough in popular culture that no reviewer needs to talk about the actual films.  Even someone who's never seen a Bond movie or read a Bond book would've heard his name, and would know he's a globetrotting British spy who gets all the girls and the gadgets, so I'll forego reviewing the films themselves.  However, extensive restoration work was undertaken for this collection, some of which is detailed in the also-extensive bonus features included in the set.  One of the makers commented that with this restoration, some of the early Bond films look less like they were made in the 60s, and more like they were *set* in the 60s.  Personally, I think he's right.  The films (and the unforgettable young Connery) look *fantastic* in HD.  So if, like me, you like Bond but never bothered to buy one of the box sets, get *this* set.  It's a feast for the eyes.

Unfortunately, as much as I like the films and the restoration work done for this set, I still have to knock one star off for the attractive, but badly designed and low-quality packaging.  It consists of two 'books', which have 'pages' that seem to be made of some kind of dense foam or paperboard core laminated in glossy paper.  The slots for each disc cover the disc's central hole and provide no fingertip cutout at the edge, making it difficult to remove discs without smudging them.  Additionally, the glossy paper is not perfectly affixed to the foam core, and separates from it without much force, allowing the book's pages to pull apart and discs to slide out of their slot.  If you really love Bond and will be viewing these films regularly, then I'd recommend taking the discs out of the included packaging and storing them elsewhere.  The packaging of my set didn't stand up to even one viewing.

Otherwise, fantastic set.  I would recommend it to any Bond fan, despite its poor packaging.",1400976000,3,2253,4.534653465346534

I was always a little or a lot disappointed in the old VHS and previous DVDs versions which seemed to suffer from inferior video and sound quality. And I've recently gotten disgusted with the way the cable and broadcast channels hack up the movies to make them fit the time frame or screen configuration. This set takes care of all of that. I can now watch them when I want with terrific video and sound quality. Not every extra that could have been provided is included but I usually watch that material sparingly.

5925219,5,B00EK6RM92,"This collection of Bond films, on Blu-ray is great,even the First film Dr. No was done, This set was one of the best I have ever bought.",1395705600,,136,4.074074074074074
5925220,4,B00EK6RM92,"The words one of James Bond's most famous villains, Auric Goldfinger, said some 20 Bond movies  and 50 years.ago.  Well, everyone's favourite superspy is still dodging bullets, beauties, and bad guys all in the best interests of Her Majesty's Government.  I went to see Dr. No when it first came out on the big screen in 1962 and last night, from this Bond 50 DVD blu-ray set, watched the latest edition ""Skyfall"".  First, let me tell you what I did with this set of two books containing the DVDs which began to fall apart the minute I opened it and sent DVDs all over the floor.  I have all the Bond films in box sets from previously on regular DVD.  So, I simply took the blu-rays and put them in the box sets and sent the 2 books + its box to recycle bin.  One star off for the dumb packaging.

But all the discs were crisp, beautiful, and clear, without any glitches.  I won't tell you the details of the films or the strong or weak points of the actors, except to say things have come off the wheels since Daniel Craig took over.  Not that it is his fault.  He is a fine actor and when given the chance to be Bond-like, he is as good as Pierce Brosnan or Timothy Dalton.  No, that problem is the scripts in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace.  There is no excuse for Casino Royale.  It is based on an actual Ian Fleming book.  All that shooting and martial arts stuff just confuses the story line which is already confused, so by the end, you are not sure if the story is in the pre-Connery or post-Brosnan timeline or somewhere in between.  Quantum is just plain weak...by far, in my opinon, the poorest Bond every made.  Only the superior acting skills of Judi Dench and Daniel Craig himself make it watchable.  We never find out who all the bad guys really are.  Skyfall is the strongest of the 3 new ones, but again disintegrates at times into shooting and special effects confusion.  The ending, with a pleasant surprise appearance by Albert Finney promises some sophistication, but quickly turns into a series of explosions and a third rate ending.  Again, only Craig and Dench's fine acting skills keep it going.  One hopes the next Bond, and probably Craig's last, builds on the fine acting and goes back to what made the early Bonds so great...including a little more humour and great story lines.

So, which is the best Bond and the best film.  I will be brief.  Sean Connery is closest to the concept appearing in the novels.  Craig is a close second, which is even sadder when you think of the lost potential in his 3 adventures. Roger Moore is the sophisticated Bond with the tongue in cheek performance that says you can't really take these movies too seriously.  Timothy Dalton gave two very fine performances and shows what a classical trained actor can do with very good adaptations of Fleming short stories.  Poor George Lazenby was in for one movie only because of a rights dispute between Broccoli and Connery, but in a sense had to give a most difficult performance along side the talented Diana Rigg (without giving the ending away).  The nod, for me, goes to Roger Moore.

The best films are undoubtedly Goldfinger followed by From Russia With Love and For Your Eyes Only (from the Moore era).  Why?  They either stick closest to Ian Fleming's books or the spirit of his books.  Curiously, in For Your Eyes Only, one of the Bond girls was Pierce Brosnan's real wife.

But, the real treasures are the bad guys and the supporting actors.  Starting with Canada's own Lois Maxwell and later, Samantha Bond as Moneypenny, Desmond Llewelyn as ""Q"",  Bernard Lee, Robert Brown, and the incomparable Judi Dench as ""M"", John Cleese (briefly) as ""R"".  And the bad guys.  What a collection of some of the greatest actors giving performances second to none.  Gert Frobe as Goldfinger, Donald Pleasance, Charles Gray, Adolfo Cieli, Joseph Wiseman, Michael Lonsdale, and the list goes on....Telly Savalas and one of my particular favourites, Louis Jordan.  Plus really bad guys like Harold Sakata (Oddjob) and Richard Keil (Jaws),  Even the CIA gets well looked after with Jack Lord, Cec Linder, David Hedison, and especially Joe Don Baker (who plays Felix Leiter and a villain in 2 different movies).  And then there is Walter Gotell, who played a nasty SPECTRE agent in From Russia With Love and went to play the semi-lovable Russian General in several of the Roger Moore films.

Finally, the Bond girls...starting with Ursula Andress in Dr. No and including Diana Rigg, Honour Blackman, Jane Seymour, Maud Adams (twice) and my favourite, Jill St. John.  Halle Berry was a pleasant surprise for Brosnan as a CIA agent.

So overall...the best Sean Connery movie is Goldfinger.  The best Roger Moore is For Your Eyes Only.  Timothy Dalton in the Living Daylights, Pierce Brosnan's best is Goldeneye, and Daniel Craig in Skyfall.

Fifty years of over the top fun, beautiful girls, great villains, and lots of good action.

Sellers try to get you by saying collectors edition this that, but figure out your pattern whether you are every going to watch those extra features or if those extra 15 min of director's cut are gonna make that big of a difference.

There are a few minor hiccups, mostly due to the change from Standard Definition on older model sets to High Definition on HD sets.  It's slightly odd that the Quantum of Solace Blu-Ray is the original disk, and not the uniform type of Blu-Rays that the other disks are.

5925300,4,B00EK6RM92,"I bought this about a month ago and have started watching it off and on for the past month. The discs are really hard to take out of the sleeves because you can't get a firm grip on it (the little finger notch they carve out requires you to slightly bend the disc in order to take it from it's groove, since the center hole is covered). The discs are indented into a cardboard backing (the backing was smooth so it wouldn't scratch the discs) and a thin piece of paper that was half cutout so the discs can be removed. After 2 weeks, the top layer has separated (came unglued) from the cardboard back for one of the pages, so the two discs on that page is now flopping around. I'm gonna have to glue it back together soon to hold my discs in place. This was my only complaint. They should have used a more durable disc holder, instead of carving a slot out from the cardboard backing and using a thinner piece of paper for the top part. I would have preferred the regular plastic disc holder that has the release button in the center where you can lightly press it to release the disc. The packaging for this disc is not very durable, especially for a special collection edition. Disappointed in the package, but the movies are great.",1391040000,,1234,4.323275862068965

To be able to watch all of them again on my free time and in Blu-ray is exciting.
Obviously this set is using my childhood memories and I can definitely live without it-  but it's a nice thing to have at home especially if you're a movie lover and a Bond lover specifically.
So why just 4 stars? Because the outer box lid which was glued got loose and tore the second I touched it (two booklets containing the discs are in an outer shell).

5925303,3,B00EK6RM92,"Great movies, nicely transferred. Picture quality and audio great, but hard tight slots in cardboard packaging scratches disks. Disks are of poor quality, as evidenced from clouded resin (one typically sees this on very poor quality, bargain-basement DVDs and cheap Chinese knock-offs), as well as block noise and playback freezes on multiple disks.

The album holder came unglued during shipment (this was not the box used for shipment) and the actual disk album pages (that hold the individual discs within the albums) have fallen apart. As a result, the discs are not being protected when stored and they have/can slip-out of the album. It appears that the binding glue used to assemble the two albums either partially dried before the albums were assembled or the glue used was not suitable for binding the albums or the pages within the binders.",1390348800,18,680,4.862068965517241

5925315,5,B00EK6RM92,"First off, I received this set as a Christmas gift, which is why I'm not a ""Verified Purchaser"". I'm also 26 years old and have had a fondness for James Bond for a long time and so was thrilled to get this set. I'm watching them in chronological order. I've just worked my way through Diamonds Are Forever, but I won't bother with reviewing the movies individually. Chances are, if you're reading this, you already like the films and are on the fence about whether or not to buy this set. All I'll say is that they look and sound fantastic in HD, even the older movies. There are enough bonus features on each disc, not to mention the bonus Blu-Ray, to keep any Bond fan entertained for a long time.

As I write, Amazon is selling the set through a third-party for about $137. So, divide that by 23 movies, and you're paying a little less than $6 each. I just searched through Amazon and found 20 of the 23 movies for sale on Blu-Ray (for the sake of simplicity, I ignored the mini-sets and bundles that are available). If you bought all of them individually, it would cost you $278.81 (which could change, of course) and even then you would still be missing a few movies. You'd also be paying, on average, almost $14 per film. All in all, this set is a terrific value. And it will look really cool on your shelf too!",1390348800,,1317,4.331983805668016

(Ok, years = 2 years.) I wouldn't pay more than that. How many times are you going to watch this thing through? It's nice to have...until the next movie comes out and you have to buy a new one. Beware: If you buy this for a loved one, you will be forced to watch all of the movies starring their favorite Bond.",1389744000,,477,4.139784946236559

I know some of the older versions of this box set did not include the Skyfall Blu-ray, it had the open slot for Skyfall but as it was not yet available on Blu-ray was not included in the set.  You had to buy Skyfall when it came out to make the set complete.
This Collection comes in nice packaging, a sturdy box/sleeve with 2 ""books"" that contain the Blu-rays.  The set is slim, doesn't take up too much space on a shelf.

i was shocked at blu ray quality of a 40 year old movie.  it was great.

I have hardly seen my husband since he opened the box.  Every night is a James Bond marathon on his giant-screen TV.  The digital remastering of the films and the Blu-Ray player make for a fantastic reproduction; the movies look as if they were made last week. If you love 007 ""Bond.

As I was watching Dr. No, it hit me immediately.  I thought, ""Hey this movie is 50 years old, how can it look this good?!?""  The thing is, they manipulated it so that it looks new and fresh...but WITHOUT changing a thing.  Literally, it is a movie that is 50 years old, that looks like it was made with today's technology.

It really is what it is and I have no complaints for it. Movies are nicely laid out in their ""binder""(i guess you would call it that?) and the only complaint I have is that the movies were divided into two binders(each with 25 years or so) instead of one coherent binder.

Personally I haven't watched any of the discs in this collection but my dad did mention that one of the movies had an issue with the audio in which the sound effects and soundtrack was much louder than the dialogue, making it difficult to understand what was being said in the movie. I don't remember which movie he said had the problem, but it was one of the Connery films.

This documentary is known to have been ported over from the DVDs but what isn't known is that here we have a totally REMASTERED version. That's right. The whole piece was re-cut from scratch. All the film clips are from the new HD source and also the photos that illustrate the piece were rescanned. Only the interviews that were shot in standard definition were upscaled. I have never heard of any company doing such an endeavor with a DVD extra before and I'd like to say kudos to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for this. It shows how much they care for the franchise and for the fans. I can't wait to check all the other films to see if the same has been done.",1388793600,,809,4.510204081632653

5925421,5,B00EK6RM92,"The content of the films is amazing!  The only one it does not include is Never Say Never Again (1983) because it was not produced by EON Productions it is not ""officially"" Bond.  This is unfortunate because it was Sean Connery's last hurrah as Bond.

The overall presentation is great as the film disks are separated by year.  However, after only 3-5 uses one of the spines of the film ""books"" separated from the spine.

I have read other reviewers with similar concerns so be gentle with the packaging.  Overall very worth the investment in funds and time.",1388620800,,558,4.642857142857143

5925441,5,B00EK6RM92,"Absolutely fantastic quality blueray movies!  Makes up to 52 year old movies look like they were made yesterday!  Digital restoration is immaculate for what I have watched so far (< 1/2 of them).  The company that did the restoration (Lowery labs corp?) showed how they did it on one disc and used the original print of the movies for scanning.  The only problem I have had is the packaging.  Very hard to get movies out without bending and cheaply made sleeves that fell apart the first time I opened it up with separation of pages that pocket the discs, the discs fall to the binding and if you close it would almost crack discs.  I guess I will have to reglue this as I am unwilling to send this back as I want to continue watching them, but I should inquire about problem.  I had wanted this since I first saw advertised but it didn't have Skyfall and price was over $150.  I only paid $99 on special and could not believe the quality or price.  Best purchase of movies I have ever made.  Completely satisfied.  The 2nd reason I made the purchase was for the commentaries and extra footage not on regular discs.  Would buy again.  A definate must have especially at that price for any Bond lover.",1388534400,,1200,4.424657534246576

5925451,4,B00EK6RM92,I liked the DVDs and cost but I have one disappointment - all DVDs are not Closed Captioned. Major frustration is the difference of script and background noises and music.

BUT I deducted a star for two reasons:

1) These seem to be the American cuts of the shows which do not show as much of/any of the nude scenes. Some of the cutaways are rather jagged such as while a conversation is occurring in bed. I can handle having the nudity or not having it, but when bond teleports from across the room into the bed during a single sentence, the cut is distracting.

2) The box is paperboard. It is a nice arrangement that keeps all the movies well displayed and in order, but I fear for the durability.

Still, it was a pretty good buy.",1388361600,,722,4.135714285714286

5925528,4,B00EK6RM92,"My father brought me up on James Bond, we have watched every movie together, gone to see the new ones in theaters when they come out. It is a tradition for us. I had bought him the DVD Set of the Collection a few years ago for his birthday, and he liked that a lot. However he did not have any of them as Blu-ray.

He absolutely loved the gift, the box it is presented in very nice. The only reason I did not rate this five stars, is because the internal packaging that holds the actual discs.

Inside of the long thin box is two ""books"" with year ranges of each of the movies. They all share a similar style, with simple text and year the movie was released. The negative is that these discs are kept in the books in cut-outs in the cardboard/thick paper, with no real protection to protect the back of the blu-ray when removing or putting the disc back in the book, on top of this the slot for the disc isn't very large and can be difficult to remove the disc from it. This could potentially damage the discs if they slip around inside the holder, or when removing or putting them back.

This is my only gripe about this purchase. Overall, it was a great gift and my father has not stopped talking about how much he loves it.",1388188800,,1227,4.168776371308017

So, they have solved that problem that others have reported as a problem.",1388188800,2,414,3.892857142857143

So I'll be brief and summarize with this:  HOLY CRAP!!!  I LOVE THIS SET!!  Each disc is loaded with Extras - the films themselves (Especially the early ones) just look fantastic.  I couldn't be more pleased, and neither will you - or the Bond fan you purchase this for.  I agree with other reviewers that the discs are a little tricky to get out of the cardboard pages, but really - you have to take into account to how to put 23 discs in a box and not have it take up an entire shelf by itself.  I can be forgiving on that one.  If you're careful, it's not an issue.  Enjoy!!!",1388188800,,717,4.205882352941177

I have only watched as far as Diamonds are Forever, and everything has worked great with one exception. For the movie 6: On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the rewind and fast forwarding was glitchy and was not smooth like the other discs. So far it's isolated to that one disc.

The case is cool but it can be a pain to try to get the discs out of the cardboard sleeve, I would much rather have preferred the discs snap in like traditional Blu Rays, even if it thickened the collection. The cardboard case also starts to show signs of wear around where the discs go almost immediately.

Other than that, I am very happy with it and recommend it to anyone who does not have the movies on Blu Ray. It's nice because now it includes Skyfall, so that disc matches the other discs in the set as opposed to buying it separate and putting it in there.",1387065600,,935,4.247191011235955

5925556,4,B00EK6RM92,"This collection brings back a lot of old memories from my youth. Never being able to watch the Bond series in sequence, this complete collection was a nice way to enjoy the different versions of Bond through the decades. I was particularly impressed by the high definition clarity of the older films in this collection, since I thought most of the original source films had deteriorated from excessive use and handling since they were first made. I did not think it was possible to make the films look like they were filmed by digital cameras recently, but apparently they used the highly sensitive negative prints and did some enhancements and editing to them, to make them looked like they were filmed in high definition. Bravo to all those who made this possible.

The only reason I did not give this collection 5 stars is the difficulty I had removing the discs from their deep well placed cardboard sleeves. I don't think I scratched any of the discs I have watched so far while removing them(at least I hoped I didn't damage them), but I might have left some of my fingerprints on them for sure.

I would definitely recommend this collection to any Bond fan regardless of age, especially at the price($99) point I paid for it. I am certainly looking forward to the next 50 years of Bond films to add to my collection, assuming I am still alive by then.",1386633600,4,1358,4.607438016528926

5925558,5,B00EK6RM92,"This set is everything I hoped it would be.  The only gripe I have is the design of the holders for each disc.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it takes a lot of care not to scrape the read surface of the disc on the cardboard sleeve each time it's removed.  Fortunately, I'm pretty careful with my discs regardless.

Aside from that minor issue, the movies themselves look and sound just as they should, and the extra features are great.  This is highly recommended for any Bond fan who wants to have the entire Eon Productions catalogue.",1386633600,,542,4.546391752577319

5925560,5,B00EK6RM92,"There have been a number of reviews and they cover ever aspect of these excellent movies so I will try not to repeat what has been covered multiple times. There is one subject that I did not notice and which is a primary issue with me - Subtitles.
My hearing has lost its ability to clearly understand some of the higher frequencies such as some voices of females and on occasion a high pitched male. Without subtitles I cannot thoroughly enjoy a movie since I can understand only parts of the dialog. This Bond series does provide subtitles in English. When I played the first disc, Dr No, I thought that only Spanish was available but that is not the case. If you want subtitles in English and did not find them here is what I did:

1. Wait for the opening comments to play and get to the page that has ""Initiate Mission"" highlighted.

2. Go up past ""Special Features"" and click on ""Language Description"".

3. This will lead you to a page with Audio & Subtitle. If you click on Audio it will tell you that it is English.

4. Click on Subtitle. You will see ""Spanish"" & ""None"". Since I did not want either one I went back to ""Initiate Mission"" and watched Dr No without subtitles.

5. Next, I chose From Russia With Love and when I got to the ""Spanish"" or"" None"" I could not believe there were no English subtitles again. So, I just instinctively scrolled up and Voila! English subtitles.

Maybe no one else has had this problem but just in case you want subtitles in English and did not find them I hope my experience is a bit helpful.",1386460800,97,1537,4.337979094076655

Having viewed Dr. No and some bonus footage today, I'm struck by several things.

1. The video reproduction on Blu-ray for Dr. No was incredible! Seeing scratches on a plastic (glass?) partition that would have been invisible with the original format, was something I never expected. The movie shot in 1962 still retains its vintage feel, but drew me into the story in a whole new way with Blu-ray clarity and color enhancements.

2. The set itself is beautifully done. Definitely a great gift to give yourself or fellow Bond-lover.

3. Bonus materials are a fun addition to this collection.

4. It's amazing to have all the 007 flicks in one collection on Blu-ray (including the latest: Skyfall) for less than four-fifty per disc!

5925564,5,B00EK6RM92,"This set is absolutely a MUST HAVE if you are a James Bond fan. It features every James Bond film from Dr. No to Skyfall (Yes, it DOES come with Skyfall now and not just an empty slot) and almost every extra feature from the individual discs is located on a bonus disc filled with extra features. It also includes ""Being Bond"" where all six James Bond actors give their thoughts on playing one of the most iconic action heroes in film history.
The case itself is the definition of CLASS. The discs come in two books, 1962-1982 and 1983-2012. Inside the books the discs are placed is sleeves with the year each film came out and the Bond girl from each film directly next to the disc. The presentation of this set is nearly unmatched and other franchises should take note. The books that the discs come housed in also have some great photos for each era of Bond and the actor who portrayed him.
If you are even a slight fan of James Bond, spy films, action films or just movies in general then you cannot go wrong buy purchasing this set.",1386201600,6,1037,4.350515463917525

5925569,5,B00EK6RM92,"Before I begin this quick review I just want to point out that I am 25 years old and I live in the US. So this review is more for the younger crowd that is interested in maybe broadening their horizens into the Bond universe and wondering if this purchase is worth it or not.

The answer is YES, it is worth every penny. I was 18 when Casino Royale came out. Familiar with Bond, only by watching Pierce Brosnan in the role, Casino Royale blew me away and I really wanted to explore the world of Bond. At that time they had released all 20 Bond films on DVD for the first time. This was my first time sitting down and watching any Bond movie pre 1995.

Needless to say, I loved the movies. I am not going to sit here and review each film individually but I did want to touch base on a few. First off, there are no BAD movies in the Bond Franchise. For 23 movies, and 50 years, that says a lot. You may find yourself laughing at MOONRAKER, but at the time Star Wars, Alien and 2001 had recently been released so Bond was simply trying to compete and try something different. It failed, but ultimately it is still a unique Bond movie and one not to miss none the less. Sean Connery without a doubt is one of the most Bad Ass Bonds. If you like Daniel Craig now, you should love Connery. Connery's movies would be my favorite with the exception of Diamonds Are Forever. One of my favorite Bond movies includes ON HER MAJESTY's SECRET SERVICE, which we see George Lazenby take on the Bond character only once. I think this is one of the better Bond films as it goes a lot more into who Bond really is, and I would relate this to Skyfall. The Roger Moore movies get a little more crazy, as Roger brought a little more comedy to the role. With constant cheesy one liners and girl after girl, Roger just brought a different element to the character of Bond. His reign as bond though I would say is my least favorite. Although Timothy Dalton had a short run, he is one of my favorite Bonds as well. LICENSE TO KILL is one of my personal favorites however it is ranked low to other fans. And Obviously there is Pierce Brosnan, who's only real stand out to me was Goldeneye.

One of the greatest elements and to me what delivers some of the magic that has kept this franchise alive for 50 years is the soundtrack/score. As you probably well know, there is a new song and intro for every Bond movie. It typically starts off with an action sequence anywhere from 10-15 minutes, and then goes into the theme song for the movie while the opening credits roll. As a Bond fan, I not only anticipate a new movie, but I also can not wait to see who will be singing the new music for it as well. The music for the Bond franchise is like no other.

This collection is well worth the purchase price for people of all ages. Whether you are like me and looking to see Bond for the first time or just a big fan of the series, there is never a better opportunity to see Bond like you have never seen him before. The picture is flawless on each release, with Dr. No looking like it was released in the 90's instead of 50 years ago. This set comes with my highest recommendation, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.",1385942400,16,3181,4.2098360655737705
5925570,5,B00EK6RM92,"Being a huge fan of these films, I can not recommend highly enough that this is well worth purchasing and a great price. These will always be classics that you can watch repeatedly and enjoy.",1385856000,3,191,4.485714285714286
5925571,5,B00EK6RM92,"Wow, I just bought this for $99.

Looking forward to seeing the very first 007 movies.

Winning!",1385769600,4,113,4.55
5925572,5,B00EK6RM92,"My father is a diehard James Bond's fan. He can even recite many songs of the opening credits. I purchased one of these sets for him as a gift, and he was really impressed. I may not get the best son of the year award, but it was very close. Near Christmas, I found out that our CEO is also a Bond's fan. Needless to say he was pretty happy with his gift, and I almost got a raise. Well, jokes aside, the thing that I like most about this set is that it is titled Bond 50. So, basically it is 50 years of Bond. This set will stay timeless on any collection, unless they make a Red-Ray or 4K version of it, and you don't have to worry if it becomes obsolete. Of course, by the time 4K media is finally here, we probably have Bond 60 or something like that.",1385769600,,755,3.9411764705882355

The idea of an empty slot for Skyfall was very forward-thinking.  I've since ripped all 24 movies (including Never Say Never Again).  Having every single movie, in addition to the ""making of"" documentaries, at the click of a button is fantastic.  It's still hard to believe a 51-year-old movie can look so incredible.",1385769600,3,441,4.531645569620253

THE SECOND PART REQUIRES A BIT MORE EFFORT.

There are four ""Unofficial"" James Bond films, not produced by Cubby Broccoli or the Broccoli family (Eon Productions).
Two of them involve the Connery family.
Three of the four unofficial films are on Blu-Ray.
They are the result of business deals negotiated by Ian Fleming early in his career, before he met Cubby Broccoli:

----- 1954: ""CASINO ROYALE"" - starring Barry Nelson:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/James-Bond-Casino-Royale-1954/dp/B009GCXH6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">James Bond Casino Royale (1954)</a>
Hard to find on Blu-Ray.
You may have to settle for DVD.
This is a one-hour black and white American TV production - one year after the book's publication.
Aside from the fact that Barry Nelson plays American agent ""Jimmy Bond"", this is reasonably faithful to the book, though the torture scene is played down:
James Bond is placed into a bathtub fully clothed and Le Chiffre (Peter Lorre) does something to him, but we're not sure what.
Cool that Peter Lorre was the first Bond Villain.
- The Blu-Ray is outrageously expensive, and hard-to-find.
Cheaper if you don't mind getting it on DVD.
Sometimes available as an Amazon download.
- Prices fluctuate wildly. To view your options, on the Amazon search bar, select ""Movies & TV"" then enter
Casino Royale 1954

The 1954 Casino Royale was originally included as a bonus feature on the 2002 DVD release of the 1967 Casino Royale:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale/dp/B00005JL0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale</a>&nbsp;-- now out-of-print.
BUT when this same 1967 Casino Royale was re-released as a ""Collector's Edition"" in 2008:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale-Collector-s-Edition/dp/6302470021/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale (Collector's Edition)</a>, the 1954 Casino Royale was missing.
Unfortunately, ordering the 2002 edition on Amazon is a crapshoot.
You never know which edition you will be getting, despite the different covers and ASIN numbers.
For a detailed history of this mess, read the Comments posted after the first review (Darren Harrison - July 19, 2002).
Try contacting your dealer first and ask for a detailed list of the ""extras"" listed on the back of the DVD case.

----- 1967: ""CASINO ROYALE"" - starring David Niven:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale-1967-Blu-ray/dp/B0055OG2BC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale (1967) [Blu-ray</a>]
David Niven plays Sir James Bond, who retired from British Intelligence after World War II - but M still seeks his help when needed.
After retirement, Bond's 007 number was kept active to confuse England's enemies.
All subsequent 007s were also required to adopt the name ""James Bond"" - this actually makes sense, considering the different actors involved.
- it's a Comedy. Sort of.

----- 1983: ""NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN"" - starring Sean Connery:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Never-Say-Never-Again-Blu-ray/dp/B001R10BM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Never Say Never Again [Blu-ray</a>
52 Year old Sean Connery came out of retirement for an enormous salary.
Its a remake of ""Thunderball"".
Not as good as the original, but Sean Connery is always worth watching.
- Plus, if you count this as Sean Connery's 7th Bond film, he ties the record previously held by Roger Moore.

----- 1967: ""OPERATION DOUBLE 007"" - starring Neil Connery.
The fourth unofficial film has no connection to either Ian Fleming or Cubby Broccoli, though it does have a connection to Sean Connery.

- James Bond is in hospital recovering from injuries.
- M needs a replacement for an important mission.
- None of the other 00s are up to the task, so M seeks out James Bond's brother.
If nothing else, the producers deserve credit for Audacity:
They hired Neil Connery - Sean Connery's brother - to play James Bond's brother.
Makes sense, I guess.
For legal reasons, he cannot be addressed as ""Mr. Bond"", so in the movie he is called ""Mr. Connery"" (actually ""Dr. Connery"").

For the first twenty years of the Bond franchise, the leadership of British Intelligence was unquestioned:
- Bernard Lee was M - James Bond's boss.
- Lois Maxwell was Moneypenny - M's secretary.
- Desmond Llewelyn was Q - Quartermaster and weapons expert.
For this film:
- Bernard Lee was hired to play the ""Director of Allied Counter-Intelligence"".
- Lois Maxwell was hired to play his secretary ""Miss Maxwell"".
- Only Desmond Llewelyn resisted the temptation. Or he was busy doing something else.

More connections to the world of Bond:
- The villain is Adolfo Celi. He was the villain in ""Thunderball"" (1965).
- The villain's henchman is Anthony Dawson. He was the villain's henchman in ""Dr. No"" (1962).
- The Bond Babe is Daniella Bianchi. She was the Bond Babe in ""From Russia with Love"" (1963).

Plus, if you count this as the Connery family's 8th Bond film, they beat Roger Moore's record.

Also known as ""Operation Kid Brother"" or ""O.K. Connery"".
Unlike the 1967 Casino Royale, this is not a comedy - these people are serious.
For more information, go to Wikipedia and look up the article on ""O.K. Connery"".
- Its not available on DVD or Blu-Ray.
It is available as an Amazon download:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Operation-Kid-Brother/dp/B00ACV87Z2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Operation Kid Brother</a>

BUT - Most of this film  is available as part of a 4 DVD boxed set:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Science-Theater-3000-XXV/dp/B0096RC4X4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery Science Theater 3000: XXV</a>
Unfortunately not available separately.
The movie download is 1 hour, 46 minutes.
This Mystery Science Theater version is 1 hour, 16 minutes (+ 16 minutes of sketch comedy).
I love MST3K. You may not.
Read the reviews first.
- The Mystery Science Theater version is also available as a pricey download:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Science-Theater-3000-Operation-Kid-Brother/dp/B00F91HGUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery Science Theater 3000: Operation Kid Brother</a>

P.S. When this episode of MST3K was originally shown on Comedy Central back in 1993,
the title was still ""Operation Double 007"".
By the time of the 2012 DVD release, the title had been changed to ""Operation Kid Brother"",
But the title on the film print still reads ""Operation Double 007"".

* I notice that, starting in January 2014, a lot of reviews have complained about the album pages in the 23 film collection coming unglued.

Apparently MGM had a problem with quality control.
I hope they fixed it.
