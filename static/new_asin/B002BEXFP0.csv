8361343,3,B002BEXFP0,"The originals from which the DVDs are made are in poor condition. I expected some scratches and spots, but it appears whole sections of some episodes have been cut. If I could have previewed these DVDs, I would not have made the purchase.",1391990400,5,238,4.558139534883721
8361344,4,B002BEXFP0,Interesting how it is set in the same time as when it was filmed (the fifties!) I think I would have enjoyed it more if they had done it to be set in the Beau Geste period 1900 - 1925 approximately. Buster and Son are wonderful. Takes me back for sure.,1382918400,2,252,3.9607843137254903
