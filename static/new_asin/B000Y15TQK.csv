Learning Scales/ Chords/how to play melody lines can be tedious and Boring :-(  Mike's teaching style make's learning any thing BUT boring - His technique for learning  - The Key of C in number of places on the guitar neck was so simple even I learned it quickly.

The lesson on ""Modes"" which have mystified me for a very long time was taught in the same no nonsense way - ""again"" - very easy to learn.

Thanks Mike",1392940800,,513,4.247422680412371
8230714,5,B000Y15TQK,"First let me say I think Mike is one great guitarist. He has such a fluid style and taste I am sure he will be one of those guys that is around for a long time.
His instruction DVD is just great. He starts with simple examples of chords and notes and moves thru a series of modes and exercises. His manner of teaching is easy and relaxed and I found it enjoyable to watch and learn. I've played for 48 years and still love learning and this DVD really gets to the point of how to improvise on guitar.
If you want to advance your playing playing I suggest you get Mike's DVD and enjoy.",1376697600,,584,4.043103448275862
