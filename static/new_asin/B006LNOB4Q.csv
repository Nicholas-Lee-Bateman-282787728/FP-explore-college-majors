8500437,5,B006LNOB4Q,"Hanasaku Iroha  is a beautifully paced slice of life drama that captures the joys and pains of living...as well as the often misunderstood pride of any worker in the service industry.  Taking place in the Kissuiso Inn, a taisho era styled hot springs inn competing in a modern world, they explore many aspects of the human experience...while at the same time searching for what it means to be a proud part of the service industry.

CONTENT ISSUES FOR PARENTS:
This would definitely be a show for later teens/young adults at the least.  Obvious fan service isn't prominent, but it does exist on rare ocassion.  Also, there can be what might be considered some very light nudity...especially during the bath segments.  It isn't explicit, nor do they ""exploit their assets"" in those types of situations, though.  It's treated more of a normal thing.  Like walking into or out of the bath with only their hair covering the chest area or the steam creates a haze where you can only see their faces clearly, but everything else is a blur, or an extreme side view so you can't see any ""details""...that kind of stuff...not particularly meant to be sensual.  Still, I definitely would not give this to young folks.  There are legal streaming sites (like Crunchy Roll) where you can check out the episodes and see for yourself if this is something you would like to keep.  Again, it is NEVER explicit and we DO NOT see anything.  Language-wise, it's pretty tame.  An occasional D-word here and there but nothing else besides that.

MOVING ON:
Plot (Absolutely No Spoilers)-
Besides the phenomenal animation work, what makes this series shine are the situations and the ways the characters interact and grow.  The show, itself, doesn't have an overarching major plot (a.k.a. the team isn't working hard from episode 1 to win some major competition by episode 26).  There are many minor subplots that come in...and many times they are referenced as the show progresses, but in essence, their isn't an actual ""main plot""...unless you consider the main heroine searching for her dream and place as one (I consider that more of a theme, though).  Instead, we focus on the daily workings and dramas that occur with each character both in and outside of work.  Might I add that the pacing is very good...there is no wasted time.

Characters and Character Development-
What's awesome is the attention to detail that they pay each character, minor and major.  Yes, many of the characters have an episode dedicated to them...but you don't just see them develop in those ""special"" episodes.  As the show progresses, you continually see each one grow in depth and understanding whether they are in the forefront or the background.  Also, several characters I did find annoying, or annoying in certain situations...but could never truly dislike them.  In each of those characters, I found aspects I could really relate to.  They were very natural and quite lovable.  And the ways they reacted when their personal selves were tested were quite heartwarming.  By the end, I really didn't want to have to leave Kissuiso Inn (so to speak) and learned so much.

Service Industry-
Another amazing aspect I enjoyed was how they brought the service industry to the forefront of the show.  Working at the inn  wasn't a backdrop to have drama and situations for the characters, at all.  It was, in fact, a key theme and aspect for this coming-of-age type drama.  Having done service industry type stuff before, it was a joy to see the ways they handled food, hosting weddings, room cleaning, and phone calls and help desk.  It was a real treat to hear the explanations and philosophies they brought into the process...and to see it actually played out in the show consistently.  They really brought a human face to an occupation often taken for granted.

All in all, this is a wonderful show that any fan of slice-of-life dramas.  With strong characterization and an uncanny ability to nurture audience connection...this is a sure emotional win.  With it's real-life situations and dealings, you are sure to learn a lot, too.  But for one who has been in the industry for any length of time, this will be a show to hold special meaning...and a reminder that your work is not in vain.",1366675200,,4250,4.836565096952908
8500438,5,B006LNOB4Q,"Seasoned anime watchers will instantly recognize the ""hot spring"" episode; it's a close cousin to the ""beach"" episode and, with its emphasis on relaxation, Japanese culture, and ecchi behavior, forms one end of the ""recognizable anime episode continuum"" (the opposite end characterized by sweat, competition, teamwork, and America-love, and epitomized by the ""baseball"" episode).  In general, it's light, humorous, filler fare with a dash of fan service to taste, depending on the nature of the show.  So what happens when an anime takes this one classic episode and expands it into an entire show?  Probably not what you think.

Hanasaku Iroha (literally, ""The ABC's of Blooming"") begins with Ohana (the main character) being dumped by her seemingly-irresponsible mother, Satsuki, with her austere yet august grandmother, Sui.  Rather than living as the spoiled granddaughter of a ""madam manager,"" Ohana is put to work with the rest of the employees, who express varying degress of interest/disapprobation at her intrusive arrival.  However, Ohana is spirited if not experienced, and slowly gains the respect of her fellow workers, eventually developing a close friendship with another waitress, Nako, and one of the cooks, Minko.  As the show unfolds, Nako becomes ""Nakochi"" and Minko ""Minchi,"" and we watch the three girls develop a bond that at times is so affecting that we forget there are only 26 episodes, and that we are rapidly approaching the end.

Which leads me to say: this is a show one wishes would never end.  Part of this desire stems from the nostalgia of being young, and having best friends, and working towards a noble goal.  Part of it is being in love, and not always knowing which decision is the right one, and dealing with the repercussions.  Part of it is choosing your own path in life, and not settling for anything less.  And finally, part of it is watching a show with a real, beating heart.  While animes often employ stock characters (and Hanasaku Iroha is no different), HI works diligently (yet almost effortlessly) to break these molds and show us the real people behind the types.  And Ohana--like Suzumiya, or Haruko, or any other female lead that strikes one as utterly original and sprung fully-formed from the creator's mind--transcends any preconceived notion of words like ""character"" and ""heroine.""  She is the show's heart and soul, and her energy radiates outward, complementing and elevating an already stellar cast.  Drama and comedy befit one another, and a good show is one that can make us laugh and cry simultaneously.  This is that show; this is the one to watch.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.",1329523200,2,2655,5.064367816091954
8500439,1,B006LNOB4Q,"For anyone who doesn't know, a set of DVDs that claims that it is ""All Regions"" is a bootleg copy. Do not buy this product until it's official NA release.

If you must watch this series now, go to Crunchyroll, they have legal, endorsed by the Japs, English subs.

This series is superb, don't give money to the people taking advantage of the creative team behind it.",1328140800,8,366,4.447761194029851
