2664286,4,B000IY06RA,I love these outdoors dvd's they are really good especially if you probably won't make it there kinda lets you feel like you are there,1372291200,,134,4.4
2664287,5,B000IY06RA,The video has beautiful photography and fascinating history. I liked the Native American narrators which added a lot to the story.,1366156800,,130,5.238095238095238
2664288,4,B000IY06RA,"Even though I own property in Alaska, near Anchor Point, I have yet had the privilige of exploring the Inside Passage.  This would be a great reference product for someone thinking about visiting the Inside Passage.  The commentary and videography are excellent.",1323216000,,262,5.214285714285714
2664289,2,B000IY06RA,"When you look at the front cover of the DVD, you might think you were buying a detailed and picturesque description of the inside passage, but you'd be wrong.  Ditto on the comments about this DVD belonging in a museum.  It was often boring and didn't describe any of the cities or towns along the inside passage.  A total waste of money.",1281744000,8,338,4.419354838709677
2664290,2,B000IY06RA,"My family and I just returned from a week-long cruise up the inside passage of Alaska, and had a wonderful time--it was SO beautiful!  A few days after our return I saw this DVD at Sam's Club and bought it.  Watching it was a major letdown.  As one reviewer has pointed out, it really did seem like a film you would see in a local museum, plus part of the film seem to have the tone of, ""Native people good, white man bad"".  Don't waste your money on this---like I did.",1276041600,10,469,4.1208791208791204
2664291,2,B000IY06RA,"I bought this for my in-laws, who are taking a cruise to Alaska next summer.  We all sat to watch the DVD after dinner, with high expectations.  I, for one, was really disappointed.

The focus of the film is on the culture of the area, which was nice for getting a better understanding of place.  Unfortunately, it was about as good as the films you usually see in free museum exhibits, and had about that much depth.  In fact, I kept feeling like that's exactly what we were watching, and wouldn't be surprised to find that they play this at some museum or other in Alaska as part of the exhibit on native Alaskan culture.

The photography is predictably pretty, although there are a LOT of prolonged shots of drops of water, individual leaves, stylized sunsets, etc.  It felt very dated, and very little of it described what you were looking at, or gave you the slightest indication of why it was significant (rather than just a pretty picture).  The images rarely had much to do with the narrative, which was dominated by readings from 19th-century travelers or short legends told by a couple of Alaskan story-tellers. Overall, the cinematography wasn't remotely as well-done as the National Geographic or Discovery specials that have come out in recent years.

As a history film, cultural film, or just for getting a person excited about a trip to this area, this DVD was really sub-standard.  I can't recommend it except as a one-view add-on to a better gift.  I can't imagine this will get a second viewing from anyone in our family, and I'd send it back if I could.",1261785600,18,1572,4.6389891696750905
2664292,5,B000IY06RA,"This is going to be an excellent gift for my mother in law.  She has always wanted to see Alaska and has almost given up getting there.  If this doesn't renew her efforts to go, it is the next best thing to her going there. She is definitely going to love this DVD, I can't wait to give it her!  Thanks Amazon for being such a great shopping experience for me, time after time!",1258156800,2,377,4.0675675675675675
2664293,2,B000IY06RA,"The description states that the DVD was released in 2006.  However, as my husband and I watched it, the video was clearly very outdated.  At the end of the DVD, the production date was shown as 1990 (as in 19 years ago!) I have been on an Alaskan cruise and was hoping to show my husband some of the beauty of Alaska and the inside passage.  If you are ""into"" museums, native dancing, local artists, etc. then perhaps this might be of interest to you.  But if you are looking for more complete (and up-to-date) information on scenery, sightseeing and excursions while visiting Alaska, save your money!",1248998400,3,601,4.588785046728972
8147774,1,B000IY06RA,"I was not expecting a history lesson about Native Alaska's.

8147783,3,B000IY06RA,Tourist  imfo is mostly based upon Native peoples of the area if you are looking for details about this sort of thing you will love this DVD.. Peoples interviewed in this DVD give great imfo on the history.. I am more into tourist attractions outside of  Native peoples realm like stores to shop in and places to eat but the DVD is well written..,1392681600,,346,4.390625
