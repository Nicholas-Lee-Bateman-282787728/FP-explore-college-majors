8716831,4,B00XVJ3NRE,"This is absolutely a must buy for any fan of the Monster Rancher series. The deleted scenes alone are worth it, but the dialog is what really makes this DVD set great. Much of the context for the dialog was removed in the English version, making some scenes completely nonsensical. From what little I know of the Japanese language, some of the subtitles seem to be slightly inaccurate, but it's probably due to things such as a play on words in the Japanese language. I prefer the fansubs with explanations in them on such things, but that's the only downside. Buy it.",1482192000,,568,4.578431372549019

8716833,5,B00XVJ3NRE,"It's exactly what it says on the tin: entire Monster Rancher anime series, in Japanese, YES it has English subtitles. It's pretty bare-bones, but it's exactly what any fan of the series is looking for.

""But I grew up with the English version,"" you may say. In comparison to the English dub, the original series in this DVD:
- has not been censored
- is a better value as of Jan 2016 (in comparison, buying the English DVDs new will run you about $100.00)
- contains 90% fewer corny Hanna-Barberaesque sound effects.
- has better openings and closings. They aren't all amazing, but Jeez, anything's better than the English opening. Plus, the openings and closing can be skipped without skipping any part of the episode proper, which I guess is standard, but I still appreciate it.

Special features?
Well, no, not really. At the end of (nearly) all of the episodes are ether the ""Eyeball this with Suezo"" or ""Today's Mocchivation"" spots that ran during the show's original run, advertising contests and giveaways that had been running at the time. (The subtitles adorably apologize as they inform us that us that the contests from 1998 are, in fact, closed.) Each episode also ends with an ""on the next episode"" preview, which is not nearly as interesting.

I have a few small complaints, but they are not significant. This set is worth every penny. I know I'll cherish it - and the series - for years to come.

These are the complaints I had, if anyone is interested:

-What is with the boxes that Discotek media is using? The ""buttons"" you push to get the disks out are difficult and really hurt my fingers, plus they layer two disks on top of each other (in a Venn diagram shape) to save space, but it's really inconvenient in practice to have to fiddle with two discs when you only need one. Throw this box in the recycle bin immediately and use one of the hundreds of jewel cases you probably have squirreled away.
-A handful of times, the subtitles would ""accidentally a word."" It works out so that you always knew what they meant, and it didn't happen often, maybe like six or seven times that I noticed. It's not a big deal, but it seems unprofessional.
-For some reason, neither the ""Suezo's/Mocchi's Corner"" or the ""on the next episode"" portions are skippable. If you want to bypass them you have to fast-forward. These are the things people would want to skip the most, if you ask me. (The ""Suezo's/Mocchi's Corner"" spots are neat the first time, but are not really very interesting overall.)",1453420800,3,2503,4.653846153846154
8716834,5,B00XVJ3NRE,"Collecting all three Seasons of the (uncut) 'Monster Farm' aka 'Monster Rancher' series, Discotek's DVD set is definitely for both fans who grew up watching 'Monster Rancher' on Sci-Fi and then Fox Kids, and for the younger generation. The translation is almost perfect, most of it translated word for word, while other things such as translating Genki's bratty ""Keh!"" to ""Rats!"" were obviously aimed towards the younger audiences, or to make a Japanese word that has many translations easier to ""get,"" or to make Genki ""sound"" more like a young boy.

These episodes are uncut, and include a lot more violence than the English episodes which were released separately onto three DVDs. Almost every episode has an extended scene of one or more of the characters getting mercilessly beaten while sad piano music plays and the other characters beg the beaters to stop. There are also fart jokes, perverted humor (Suezo is a real pervert ha ha ha), and other things deemed unacceptable by American kids television. So if you are watching with a child, I would advise being ready to talk to them if they get scared or don't understand a lot of the humor in the show.

The series itself is great (although the third season is pretty much useless and ruins the original, fitting ending for the show). It's very cheesy in that anime way where everyone is obsessed with the power of friendship and love, but the characters are loveable enough that you can roll your eyes at them, but really grow to care and root for them anyway. The show is a lot darker and more serious than Pokemon or Yu-Gi-Oh, but has many moments of levity with the conversations (or fights) between the characters. There are serious lessons to be learned, and there are real-life consequences to the heroes' actions.

The only complaint I have is that there is no episode list (which episodes are on which DVDs). It makes watching as a long-time fan who wants to see how certain episodes are different uncut frustrating. Also there are no extras to be seen, which is a bit sad because the Japanese VHS tapes included this cute song and dance with people dressed up like the monster characters. I miss it, but hey, I'm just glad this exists. Thank you, Discotek Media!",1438819200,7,2230,4.742268041237113
