1365293,5,B00004WI6C,"The made-for-TV film is excellent. Its historical and story setting is enchanting. Set in Scotland, you will really get a feel for the time and culture, as well as beautiful views of the land. The story is engaging and stirring with wit and poise. There is intrigue, adventure, fighting, and romance. Acting is superb. Alan Breck Stewart (Armand Assante) and David Balfour (David Blessed) are a dynamic pair. Their juxtaposition showcases the classic opposites - a hot-headed Highlander and level-headed Lowlander - thrown together and united as common Scots. The direction and soundtrack were good. The music will have you humming and is well timed onscreen.

I had first watched this movie several years ago on VHS. I watched it many times. I have long waited for a DVD release. While I am glad that this is finally on DVD, I am somewhat disappointed. The video and sound are not remastered, so they are not up to par in quality. It is still in stereo. It could have at least been remixed to Dolby Surround. Special features are lacking. Commentaries, featurettes, and documentaries are lacking. For a movie that has such a rich historical background, this lacking is a sin. A redeeming feature that is not documented on the box or anywhere as far as I can see, is that the scenes have been integrated better and new footage has been added amounting to at least 10 minutes according to my estimates. When a TV-movie is released for home video, a scene would fade back into itself, denoting the in-between slot for commercials. In this DVD, this has been eliminated. The new integrated transitions are alright, though sometimes interrupted the short-term flow of the movie. As for the other new footage, they are nothing ground-breaking, but add a litte more content to the movie.

To sum things up. if faced with the choice, I would still give up the cash for this DVD anyday. The film is excellent.",1095897600,35,1901,4.7926829268292686
1365294,4,B00004WI6C,"This version is ten times better than the Walt Disney. As far as I know it stuck so much closier to the book and it inculded the girl, which I do not understand why the Walt Disney version cut her out. It had a great deal of action in it so you are never bored. I'm sure there was nothing offensive in this movie, although it has been a long time since I have been able since I have seen it. The only thing that I find disappointing is that the price is way to expensive for a VHS, so there is now way I can afford it and a classic like this deserves to be on DVD. So I hope that someday, somebody will make it affordable and let it been on DVD.",1086998400,,645,3.8208955223880596

1365311,4,B00004WI6C,"The actual story of Kidnapped is woven into another narrative, not a bad job, really, sort of an expansion giving more background.

1365329,5,B00004WI6C,"It's not often a movie captures the true essence of a novel, but I feel this film goes beyond that and actually improves upon what is one of R.L. Stevenson's weaker works. Armand Assante brings Alan Breck to life, even more so than his literary counterpart, much like Jack Nicholson does with McMurphy in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" The film answers questions the book leaves open, and IMHO makes a stronger story in doing so. If you like the book, you'll love the film.",1365033600,2,477,4.558139534883721

1365356,4,B00004WI6C,"While I was not completely satisfied with all aspects of this film (especially its lack of developing the theme of feuding between the various Scottish houses: Campbell, Stewart), it was a good film that remained more loyal than most. (I personally preferred this adaptation to the old Disney adaptation of about 1/2 the length.)

As a family film (or a film for anyone who enjoys period pieces), this adaptation of Kidnapped should not disappoint.

1365358,3,B00004WI6C,"This version of this old Robert Louis Stevenson classic is well worth seeing. I still must admit I prefer the acting in the Disney version and wish it too was available on a Region 1 DVD instead of requiring US customers to buy a multi-region player and Region 2 disc in order to view it. This rendition has a good cast and does a great job of showing how hard the times were in Scotland during this era of British rule. It does a fine job of showing how people mostly ran to get from one place to another. There were few horses and carts there then. It has a more realness to it but Disney's slightly lighter look at it is good too. I highly recommend this be rented before buying to make sure you enjoy this darker version of the story. Good quality DVD with few features and decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Luis Brunel's Robinson Crusoe"".

1365359,5,B00004WI6C,"This movie is incredible! Being of Scottish descent, my boys and I were excited to watch this movie; simply on that fact. However, what we found was adventure and excitement beyond our own imaginings... we found the Highlands and the Highlanders!

Everything about this movie shouts, FIGHT FOR FREEDOM! We first encountered this movie almost 10 years ago, and are still watching it annually (at least). I have sons and they are warriors at heart (aren't most boys?) Kidnapped has captured that warrior spirit and packaged it in an epic film. Huzzah!

The adventure, the scenery, the filming, and particularly the choice actors and actresses in this film make it a classic and a must own for any family. I think RLS, himself, would be proud of this one!

1365361,2,B00004WI6C,This movie was an ongoing struggle between attention and yawns. I finally realized I didn't like the movie after it had several times moved to a new scene and I wanted it to end.

1365362,4,B00004WI6C,"Okay, I'll watch anything with Brian McCardie in it because he's just too good and Scottish to pass up.  He has the face and demeanor of the ideal Davie Balfour, and he's just a joy to watch as he puts his own spin on one of my favorite childhood story characters. Armand Assante as Alan Stewart is erm, okay but the accent leaves much to be desired and who was his costumer?  The guy's gotta make for the heather and elude his enemies in a big tri-corn with wiggly white feathers on it.  It's a little cartoonish, but he drew me in and I can overlook it.  The rest of the cast is a delightful collection of characters seen in every Masterpiece Theatre production somewhere.  Good fun and not just for kids.",1188172800,,707,4.325757575757576
1365363,3,B00004WI6C,"""Kidnapped"" by Robert Louis Stevenson is my favorite book of all time.  I began reading it when I was a young lad and have probably read it hundreds of times since.  I know most of the dialog by heart.

Needless to say, I have been consistently disappointed by the film versions, which deviate needlessly from the story.  The only version that respects its source material is the Disney version, which I highly recommend.

The Armand Assante version was made for cable TV and shown over two nights.  I missed it and was excited when it came out on VHS.  But when I first viewed it, I was terribly disappointed; although it looked great, this version had the same fault as the others--namely, inserting all sorts of extraneous subplots that add nothing to Stevenson's story and actually weaken it.

Recently, however, I re-watched it, and I have to temper my original dislike.  This version does have some excellent points in its favor.  It's beautifully photographed, and the attention to detail in dress and setting is remarkable.  The portions that do respect Stevenson's novel have never been done better, perhaps not even by the Disney version.  However, its faults remain.  Assante and McCardie are miscast physically as Alan Breck and David Balfour (although Assante does swashbuckle through the film with a vengeance, he looks nothing like Stevenson's description of him, which was based upon historical fact); the film was shot in Ireland, which does not look like Scotland (watch ""Rob Roy"" if you want to see what the Scottish Highlands really look like); the writers manufacture a love story for David Balfour, and this character does not fall in love until the Stevenson's sequel ""Catriona,"" and then to a completely different girl; Alan visits Flora MacDonald, who lived on the Isle of Skye, not on the mainland; and worst of all, the writers introduce a completely unnecessary subplot centered around a British officer named Reid, who instigates the Appin murder in order to place blame on James Stewart.  I could go on and on--there's plenty more--but you get the idea.

So yes, there's plenty in this version to enjoy, but please be aware--it is *not* Stevenson.  For that you need to go to the Disney version.  Still, compared to the utter abomination that appeared recently on PBS, this version is a masterpiece.",1186185600,17,2329,4.930769230769231
1365364,5,B00004WI6C,I definantly like this version better than the Disney one. It is more realistic. It doesn't follow along with the book totally but is an enjoyable movie. It is long which doesn't bother me! Very good movie for the family.,1184371200,4,221,4.55
1365383,5,B00004WI6C,"This is an excellent movie. The characters are developed well, and the plot keeps moving along while allowing for meaningful dialog. Although I don't remember all the details of the novel, this movie impressed me by how closely it followed the storyline of the novel. It has a satisfying, happy ending but lots of conflicts to resolve on the way to it, plus some romance. My wife and I stayed engrossed in the movie and will be watching it again before long, so that we can pick up some of the details we missed. Except for some of the violence, this is a family movie (at least for children 12 and up). Armand Assante's performance was totally convincing- an excellent portrayal.",1184284800,2,680,4.628099173553719
1365384,5,B00004WI6C,Armand Assante is one of the best actors ever.  He does not make a lot of movies but the ones that he chooses are all excellent.  He did a marvelous remake of a marvelous classic.  My husband loved it.,1179187200,,201,4.102564102564102
1365385,5,B00004WI6C,"I thought this was an excellent filmic version of one of my favourite childhood books--Kidnapped--and its sequel, Catriona(as the film covers both books). Kidnapped And Catriona were always much more than fantastic adventure stories, and the film brings out all those other aspects too--the tormented history of Scotland, the different currents in Scottish society, the moral ambiguity of a lot of the characters, the way in which ancient clan traditions(which are not universally good, of course) must bow before the new order of things(more civilised but less heroic, in some ways). But all these things are not allowed to get in the way of the action. Great acting, settings and atmosphere make this a quite enthralling experience.",1169942400,5,734,5.282051282051282
1365386,5,B00004WI6C,"It is so nice to have a newer version of an old classic that does not have to use nudity, or dirty language to get a point acrossed. The location was breathtaking making it all the more enjoyable to veiw. Acting was very well done. I first saw the movie on television and enjoyed it very much, I was ticked pink to see that I could get a DVD for myself to be able to watch whenever I want.

The movie was made long ago and being a Disney movie, it has all the hallmarks of those old great Disney films, which not only means it is great for kids to watch but also for adults. If you really want to see the only great adaptation of this story, you must see the old Disney version, unfortunatly, it has never been put on dvd,so you'll have to find the vhs version.",1161388800,4,676,4.090225563909774
1365388,4,B00004WI6C,"I enjoyed this film, and thought it was a decent adaptation of the book. The acting and production values were very good. There were some major plot changes, so a purist would find fault with it. In fact that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of five. However, the spirit of the original adventure remained intact. Some of the action may be a little intense for the under 5 group, depending on the sensitivity of the child, but other than that it was a good family film.",1153440000,7,469,4.280898876404494

I was wrong. I didn't expect it to follow the book exactly (what does?) but this just dumps all the things that made the book good and focuses on points that really had nothing to do with the heart of the story. It should have been about a friendship forged from extreme perseverance and adventure. It just ends up being a poorly organized sequence of events with a wrap up thats less than interesting. I actually ended up not likeing the main character of the movie. Thank goodness Treasure Island didn't end up like this!",1143936000,5,697,4.496062992125984

The bottom-line is this is an interesting film that is even-handed with the historical facts of the time. The film doesnt explain what the Scottish conflict was about, but you can do some remedial reading afterwards to get up to speed. The acting is good. The scenery is excellent. And it is refreshing to see characters with rotten teeth and really bad hair!",1127433600,21,474,4.7926829268292686
1365391,4,B00004WI6C,"I purchased this DVD in order to watch it with my kids (youngest is 10).  They were initially unsure whether they would like it, but after mentioning that it was based on the Robert Louis Stevenson book, and that Mr. Stevenson had written Treasure Island and Jekyll and Hyde, the kids' interests were piqued.  As the DVD is also rather long (in terms of current films), I was concerned whether their interest would hold.  However,the movie kept their interest captive without any problem.

First of all, let me say that the scenes and scenery are great.  One really gets a feel for the time and place of the story.  Costumes, villages, landscapes, etc. are generally high quality.  Moreover, the acting (including accents) were fine all around.  I found the film engrossing, while my kids were very excited to find themselves so involved in the story.  Of course they have seen a plethora of films that ""transport"" the viewer elsewhere, but many of these films have some feeling of artificiality - that is, they are too far out of our own experience to truly feel ""real"".  I found, and I think that my kids found, the scenes in this DVD believable and approachable.  Having experience in historical reenactment, I know that portraying a sense of another time and place in such a way as to encourage ""viewers"" to participate is a sort of magic and I felt that there was some of this magic in the movie.

As far as the story goes, there are issues that may be a bit complicated for younger viewers to understand.  Additionally, there is some violence (particularly the ship scenes), but nothing too brutal.  The worst scenes are the death of a few minor characters (gunshot and hanging), as well as a view of a pool of blood after a battle.  This movie isn't for very young viewers, but I would guess that most kids over the age of 10 wouldn't have a problem with the film.  The level of violence is really fairly minor in comparison to much of today's fare.

I have been describing the movie in terms of a family film, but I also think that it is a good companion to the book.  Teachers, students, lovers of literature, etc. will likely find this a welcome addition to their collection.",1106352000,73,2185,4.587628865979381
