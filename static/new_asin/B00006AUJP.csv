1739323,4,B00006AUJP,"This DVD is an opportunity to see Chet Atkins and Jerry Reed collaborate on many songs and lyrics written and played by both artists.  I thought it was wonderful and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of the music and the interplay between Chet and Jerry.  It is true that you will have heard most of the music before, but the visual experience was very entertaining.  The quality of the musical recording was fine, if not exceptional.  I heartily recommend this DVD to any fan of either artist.",1223164800,2,494,4.64367816091954
1739324,5,B00006AUJP,"This is such an enjoyable show. Jerry and Chet were like none other before or after. The music is inspiring and fun. Now that both Jerry and Chester have passed on, maybe someone will get some more material out there for us to enjoy. With all of the TV and concert work Jerry performed, its a crime we don't have more material of his available to us on DVD.",1220659200,2,357,4.188405797101449
1739325,2,B00006AUJP,"I was dissappointed in this DVD.  Mr. Reed acted like he really did not
want to play.  Both of these men are great and talented guitar players but
something was missing in this program.  The video and audio were also dissappointing.",1208390400,,232,4.609756097560975
1739326,5,B00006AUJP,"Even though Chet has passed on, I think he will always be remembered as the class person that he was.  So mild and easy going and seemed so nice. And will always be given the credit as a GREAT guitar picker, of any and all genres.  Jerry, on the other hand, I don't think has nearly the recognition that he deserves.  He's proven over and over that he's right up there with Chet.  These albums with Chet attest to that fact.  Let someone please recognize him and elect him into the CMHOF while he is still alive.  I am in the throes (it's difficult) of reading that book about Elvis (Careless Love, by Peter Guralnick).  In it, Elvis wants to record ""Guitar Man"".  But he nor his back-ups can get it right.  The way Jerry did it. (Well, what did they expect? Jerry wrote the darn song.)  So someone says ""you've just got to get Jerry to come and do it himself"".  So he has his ""people"" call Jerry to come to the studio and record it with him.  Elvis is thrilled to death.  It was just as he wanted it to be.  After it's done, Kernel (Yes the ""korny kernel"" as I call him.  He was NOT a Colonel. That title has to be earned).  Anyhow, Kernel and his people try to badger Jerry into giving them publishing/copyrights to the song, or selling to them.  Jerry stood his ground.  They weren't getting it.  And they shouldn't have called him off of his fishing trip to begin with.  If they had just told him in the beginning what the deal was that they wanted, he wouldn't have wasted their time.  GOOD for Jerry.  I guess up to that point, Elvis had always gotten what he wanted.  Not this time.  JERRY BELONGS IN THE COUNTRY MUSIC HALL OF FAME with Chet and the others.",1186963200,16,1664,4.242811501597444

1739328,1,B00006AUJP,"I read an excellent review of this DVD in a guitar magazine, and was expecting something exceptional.

Instead, this is a concert of 4 guitar players that are just jamming on all the songs.  There is no attempt to arrange the guitar parts, and consequently 2 of the guitar players are totally superfluous.  It's quite obvious that other than a show ""the previous week"" they never rehearsed any of the music.  When musicians of this caliber get together to jam the result can be magical, or, as in this case, a depressing video of world class musicians that just aren't connecting.

I agree with the previous reviewer that the camera work is not appropriate for this type of concert, however, I can forgive a cameraman or producer for not being aware of what to film during a guitar solo, but I can't forgive great musicians for playing such a mediocre show.",1111363200,8,857,4.6490066225165565
1739329,4,B00006AUJP,"As a fan - this DVD is priceless. It's literally like being in the living room with long time friends. Their performances are excellent, relaxed, humorous, and impromptu. For example Chet says, ""Play something, Jerry. I forgot my capo,"" and walks off the stage; and where everyone tries to help Jerry plug in his guitar.
As a musician - I was disappointed with the camera work. Too many close ups of faces during key guitar solos. Close ups of the right hand picking, but never a close up of the left hand soloing. The camera person was obviously not a guitar player and didn't seem to know when a solo started or ended, or sometimes who was even playing it. Nevertheless, Chet's hilarious, but very credible distorted whammy bar rock solo, and his inability to pull off a riff in The Claw, were just two priceless moments of humor and humanity from these two flawless masters of the guitar.",1040169600,35,891,4.610062893081761
1739380,5,B00006AUJP,"If only there was more musicianship of this caliber around today I would listen to far more contemporary music, but Chet Atkins and Jerry Reed had few equals, and there's even fewer around now. This concert from The Bottom Line in 1992 is absolutely brilliant. The music is first rate, and the guitar work is something to behold (especially if you're a guitarist yourself) with Jerry in particular playing masterfully. I love the musical selection, but gravitate toward the boisterous Reed. There's an interesting choice of music here, and it's all good. I was particularly fond of Jerry's version of Bob Dylan's ""Don't Think Twice It's Alright."" Chet's beautiful ""I Still Can't Say Goodbye"" is another highlight, and shows off Chet's quite gentlemanly mannerism better than most any other number.

Throughout the entire show the casual exuberance these two old friends shared as they played is a mesmerizing delight to watch (I love Jerry trying to get his guitar plugged in, for example, and Chet in search of a capo.)  I am a fan of both these men, and as guitarists they were perfectly matched. Anyone who loves music should watch this concert with all due haste.",1383436800,5,1167,4.918781725888325
1739381,4,B00006AUJP,"I attended this show. At the time I wasn't very familiar with Jerry Reed's guitar playing; I knew him mainly from his hit records ""Amos Moses"" and ""When You're Hot, You're Hot,"" and knew that he was an actor in films that I had little interest in seeing. This concert at New York's now-defunct Bottom Line left me with the impression that Reed had a lot of talent as a picker, but that his execution was a bit tentative and sloppy.

Since then, I've been exposed to lots more of Reed's fine playing through recordings and the many clips that can be viewed on YouTube. Almost all of it is better quality than what can be heard on this DVD. It's nice to see a concert-length video of these two masters together, but Reed sounds and looks like he's out of practice or suffering a crisis of confidence. I've heard him allude elsewhere to having had some sort of substance abuse problem at some point in his life; maybe that plays a role in the substandard performance here.

Nonetheless, I can't bring myself to give this less than four stars because of the unique artistry of these two great musicians. If you're a fan of either or both of them, you'll enjoy this.",1382572800,,1161,4.446009389671362

7966544,5,B00006AUJP,"Great live show featuring two of the great finger-pickers of all time, Chet Atkins and Jerry Reed. Highlights such as their version of the American standard ""Summertime"" and the Bob Dylan classic ""Don't Think Twice (It's Alright)"" are part of a show where melodic taste and seasoned chops blend into a wonderful evening of music. It's sad that both of these guitar greats are no longer with us, so this rare chance to see them both together remind us of their Grammy-winning collaborations from the 70s. A must see for their fans; a great show for new guitarists learning the artistry of two of the all-time greats. Atkins' long-time sideman Paul Yandell (also sadly deceased now) is yet another reason to just sit back and enjoy these greats at work on this early-90s masterpiece. Highly recommended!",1496620800,,801,4.897058823529412
