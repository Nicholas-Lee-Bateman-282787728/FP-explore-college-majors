3723394,5,B001NTGZVK,Very informative and well made.  This dvd gives a clear understanding of history of Wudang Tai Chi Chuan.  The training steps are clear and precise!,1235606400,3,148,4.88
3723395,5,B001NTGZVK,"Wudang Taijiquan is a very unique system of Taijiquan from my humble experiences with it and a handful of the other systems-- from Zheng Manqing's softest of soft Yang Style form to the Fajing filled Chen Style forms. Interestingly, Wudang has found a middle ground between these two ideals and has created a lovely and balanced system there within.

In this DVD, Master Zhou not only shows us the form and its many applications, but he opens up the concepts of the postures and techniques. Many of the DVD's I've purchased had limiting application sections demonstrating against a punch or kick uniquely to a circumstance. But here, Zhou Xuan Yun opens up these applications by expressing the reasoning behind their mechanics, and the motivations for the footwork. So, instead of learning how to block a punch with a technique, or remove an energy in a specific circumstance, you can truly pick out the essence of Taijiquan, and the unique blend of Wudang's aggressive footwork, and responsive twistings and turnings of the body.

The form itself is a bit overwhelming, even for a veteran practitioner of any martial system. 108 moves may not sound like much, but in the slow pace and intricate body mechanics of Taijiquan, this DVD is going to be a chore to get through, let alone mastering! In other words, you will definitely get your money's worth in high quality material!

I would definitely recommend this DVD to everyone with Taijiquan experience, and especially someone looking to explore the different interpretations of Taiji Theory.

For those without experience in any internal system though, the DVD may be a bit tough to understand the shifting and stepping principles at first, but I would always recommend to anyone to experience a system with an instructor before jumping headfirst into a form on DVD. As an exception though, this DVD is excellent for learning Standing Post Meditation, and some great warm-up routines. Also, a beginner will find their heart swept away by the intelligent-- yet very very applicable-- application section to assist in comprehending the ideology of Taijiquan in combat & self-defense.

I am extremely excited for the follow up Wudang Gongfu DVD, and will be looking for Master Zhou Xuan Yun's seminars up and down the Northeast US area!",1234742400,33,2287,5.007894736842105
3723396,2,B001NTGZVK,"Mind you that the low rating is my personal opinion as it applies to myself
and maybe others like me that just want to learn the wudang 108 form.
I gave it 2 stars: one for production quality, which is good, and the other for
the effort of putting out a wudang 108 form, which is not easy to find.
I really wanted to like this DVD...I tried but could not...I am familiar with a
few wudang forms and really want to learn the 108, so I was happy to find this dvd,
to my surprise, there is NOT teaching step-by-step of the forms, just a
demonstration of the form , (which is well done). The dvd is 2 hours and 24
minutes long, the warming part is way too long and the rest of the dvd is
a long explanation of martial applications, which gets boring and repetitive,
this maybe o.k for a martial artist, but not for somebody that just loves tai chi
as a healing and spiritual art. Also, I like to back-up my dvds in case one gets
damaged and  also carry them in my ipod...not with this one, since it is copy-protected, I could not put it in my ipod or make a personal copy for storage.

3723397,5,B001NTGZVK,"Although I practice Chinese Kung Fu, I'm a beginner in Taiji practice.  I got a number of DVD's for Christmas, and this is the one I find I keep coming back to.  I was able to take a workshop with Master Zhou in Connecticut last year, and his instruction was great.  His humble, friendly and peaceful nature carry over in this DVD -a welcome new addition to the American martial arts scene!",1233187200,2,390,4.388888888888889
3723398,5,B001NTGZVK,"I'm so glad that I bought this DVD!
I already study Yang style and Chen style Taiji Quan, and I own my share of DVD's but I find that seeing Taiji from a Daoist perspective has greatly added to my personal practice.  Master Zhou's presentation of the ancient Wudang form is so graceful!  In addition to the form, the other parts of the program are also great.  I especially enjoyed Master Zhou's introduction, which talks about Taiji in the greater context of Chinese history and Daoist philosophy.  Master Zhou's program also includes a moving version of Zhan Zhuang standing meditation that I'd never seen before.  I've added some of the Wudang methods to my daily Taiji practice, and I feel better than ever!",1233100800,6,711,4.747967479674797
3723399,5,B001NTGZVK,"The Wudang YMAA Taijiquan DVD is one of the best releases ever by the YMAA. The YMAA always produces superior quality books and dvds for martial arts both internal and external- and the Wudang Taijiquan DVD is a shining example. When I first learned that Zhou Xuan Yun of Daoistgate.com was creating a Taijiquan DVD, I immediately pre-ordered a copy. When I recieved it in the mail I found that was a personal lesson with a world-class Gongfu Taijiquan Master. Xuan Yun is simply amazing, and his instruction is absolutely phenomenal. I was especially excited about the DVD because I love Wudang Gonggu, and there is very little published educational material available about it. The instruction and demonstration is of the highest quality, and the Taijiquan sequence is both comprehensive and beautiful. Anyone, whether beginner or master will immediately fall in love with this release.
As a dedicated Martial Artist, I feel very blessed to live in an era where such sacred tradition and teqhnique are freely and openly taught. Zhou Xuan Yun is a wonderful teacher, and I strongly reccomend this DVD to everyone.",1233014400,4,1114,5.027027027027027
3723400,5,B001NTGZVK,The other reviewer said it all; so I will just say this is a MUST HAVE item.  Wudang has some of the best martial artists in the world! Xuan Yun is fantastic to watch and he is sharing a lot in this DVD.  For those of you who are familiar with my ratings; you know it takes a lot to get a five star out of me.  If I could I would rate this 10 STAR!  The 108 move form is great but even more special is the martial application is also demonstrated.  I hope Wudang shares much more with the western world.,1232064000,4,503,3.8446601941747574
3723401,5,B001NTGZVK,"I was very excited to hear about the release of this DVD.  Wudang Mountain has always been known as a Taoist and Martial Arts center, and Zhou, Xuan-Yun is a fine representative of the high level of martial arts that have come out of Wudang Mountain.  I've seen other martial artists demonstrating various Wudang styles and have been impressed by the effective techniques present in those styles for dealing with violent situations.

The coincidence of this release for me is my re-reading of Chronicles of the Tao, written by Deng Ming-Dao.  The book chronicles the life of Kwan Saihung, who, in similar fashion to the writer and performer of this DVD, Zhou, Xuan-Yun, trained in a Daoist monastery and later left to travel around China to meet and interact with other martial artists.

Zhou is obviously a very skilled martial artist.  His enthusiasm, knowledge and expertise are very evident in this DVD.  Zhou does not hold back and freely explains and demonstrates the various applications for the postures in the form.  His presentation of the Wudang Taijiquan set looks similar to Chen Style and Yang Style Taijiquan.  It is very direct and focused and is obviously a fighting art.

The DVD provides the following:

History and background of Zhou, Xuan-Yun
History of Wudang martial arts
Excellent presentation of standing Qigong, Zhan-Zhuang and reasons as to the importance of making this part of your Taijiquan routine
Demonstration of the full Wudang Taijiquan 108 set
Applications for all of the postures

The warm up section offers some great tips, such as using various postures and transitions within the form as a short type of warm up.  Zhou spends a necessary amount of time on stressing the importance and usefulness of warming up through the use of Taijiquan movement and postures.  However, his demonstration of rolling the neck in a complete circle is considered by some to be ill advised.  It is acceptable to roll the neck front to left and right ninety degrees, but rolling the neck completely around in a circle can cause problems to the vertebrae.

Many of the postures in the Wudang Taijiquan form are similar to the Yang style of Taijiquan, but have different names for the postures.  Chen style postures are also evident.  In the applications section, numerous applications for each posture are shown.  Zhou stresses that a practitioner should choose those applications that fit their body type and martial arts skill level.  Nicholas Yang, the son of Master Yang, Jwing Ming, helps Zhou demonstrate the various applications.

Zhou's demonstration of the various applications shows an understanding and practical application of the basic tenets of Taijiquan; that being yield, neutralize/dissolve, strike.  Zhou demonstrates various applications from the left and right sides, allowing one to see all parts of the techniques.

Zhou has some unique takes on applications for postures such as Needle at the Bottom of the Sea, which he demonstrates as a flowing of one Qin Na application to another.  Zhou capably demonstrates how the applications should flow and change as the opponent/adversary reacts and deals with the applications.  Zhou also demonstrates how to respond to experienced martial artists who might try neutralizing techniques on the applications.  Regardless of how the opponent reacts to the original application, Zhou shows that their is always a linked application that will handle any response.

Bottom line, it's a great DVD and excellent demonstration of both the form and the various possible applications of Wudang Taijiquan.",1231718400,14,3579,5.168402777777778
3723402,5,B001NTGZVK,"This is as authentic as it gets! This DVD by Daoist Monk Zhou Xuan Yun gives more than can be expected from just 1 DVD on a subject that many spend a lifetime trying to master.
All aspects of ritual training are addressed with care.
I feel there is something for all levels because I learned the foundational practices of Zhuang Zhuang, warm up and general movements of the form from this DVD as a beginner and then
sought out private instruction from the Master himself. I don't believe anyone will master this art from ANY DVD but I can state I still learn from this DVD although I am no longer a beginner but a teacher. So in that regard this DVD is invaluable as a reference tool.",1381104000,,684,4.310077519379845
3723403,4,B001NTGZVK,"very good video, not for beginners, I'm from Latin American and my English us very low, but thanks to subtitles understand something, which fails to know is whether in practice the basic movements, before teaching thus, the teacher demonstrates the exercises as a mirror or I have to practice them with his back to tv, thanks.",1376870400,,326,4.839285714285714
3723404,5,B001NTGZVK,"I'm not familiar with the Wudang form having only familiarity with the Yang style Tai Chi. It strikes me that this form is more subjective, i.e., less clearly defined than the Yang form. Nevertheless, it is probably a fine style.  For me, the value in this video is the explanation and demonstration of the self-defense applications for the various form postures.  I was particularly impressed with the master's insistance that each technique was not hard and fast but that the practiioner should adapt techniques to each situation.  This understanding gives the practioner a wide range of flexibility in applying the techniques.  In retrospect, perhaps this is why the form doesn't seem as structured as the Yang form, because one is expected to adapt it?",1360713600,2,756,5.07258064516129
3723405,5,B001NTGZVK,"Loved the introduction. The standing meditation instruction and form applications were the two main reasons I bought the video. A good reference for beginners. A gold mine for intermediate to advanced students like me. Very professionally done. No one should expect to learn a form this complex from watching a video, alone. Whatever style you study, this DVD will broaden your understanding of Tai Chi Chuan.

Thank you so much. I had many ""Ah-Hah!"" moments watching such a highly skilled player and many new insights into the martial applications of the movements. I found myself taking notes on how to tweak my own form. Even picked up a tip or two on stretching which is so important as one ages.",1350086400,,700,4.833333333333333
3723406,5,B001NTGZVK,"This DVD does an excellent job of providing the historical, cultural, and philosophical context in which Taijiquan (Tai Chi) arose. The opening segment does an great job of introducing both the art and Xuan Yun Zhou. If you're interested in meditation and it's relationship to Tai Chi, learning a Tai Chi form, or you want to know more about the martial applications of Tai Chi this video contains all three.",1319846400,3,408,4.8428571428571425
3723407,5,B001NTGZVK,"As others have said, this DVD is not for the beginner wanting to learn the 108 form. There are many other YMAA DVD's and books for that purpose. This is, however a gold mine of information for the serious student. Zhou, Xuan-Yun is a Wudang monk with incredible skill. It's like watching a primordial spirit swirl through the universe when you see his 108 form. I teach Yang style 24 and Chen Man'Ch'ing forms, and know what skill it takes to make this look so easy. Just the opening frames of the dvd showing the Wudang area of China are worth watching.

Zhou, Xuan-Yun talks about standing meditation being the foundation of the taiji forms. Every teacher I ever studied with says the same thing. Meditate, Stand, Meditate and Stand some more. This video shows how to do this.

I loved most of the warm up exercises but was not a fan of the big, fast neck circles or of the bouncing into the leg on the stretches. Be careful with these, if you are new.

Most videos teach form work first and then application much later. This DVD works in the opposite way. The form movements are demonstrated using various applications. Master Yang's son Nicholas and Adison Martin are the assistants. Several applications are show for various form moves. The Chinese name and English name are show on screen to help follow along. Excellent for the practiced taiji player to finesse some of his moves. Very subtle details are pointed out to make a huge difference.

I like the fact that Zhou, Xuan-Yun brings both assistants up to thank and he also says something like: I know that there are martial artists watching who are at a higher level than I am. I would like to invite them to make comments and help me improve my form. Humble, Beautiful and Powerful. Get the DVD!",1271808000,4,1758,4.571428571428571
3723408,3,B001NTGZVK,It was not what I was expecting.  I was looking for some wudan tai chi form instruction.  This more showed how each form applied to combat situations.  It was very enlightening just not what I was expecting.,1270598400,4,207,4.54054054054054
3723409,4,B001NTGZVK,"It is traditionally believed that Tajiquan originated in the secluded Wudan mountains by Zhang, San-Feng during the Song dynasty (960-1280 CE).  What a treat it is to see the a full Tajiquan set directly from a Wudang mountain monk! Definitely not for a beginner but if you are familiar with the Zhan-Zhuang sequence it is great way to learn the marital/self defense applications.  I imagine it would be difficult to learn this entire set from this DVD alone.  But as with all qigong/tajiquan sets its always best to learn directly from a master.  Since your master is not likely from the Wudang mountains, this really is a great purchase to supplement your practice! If you are a fan the movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon you may be familiar with legendary Wudang mountain monks - this is likely one of the few ways you will ever see a full taijiquan set and explanation given by the real deal!",1266019200,2,898,4.7006369426751595
3723410,5,B001NTGZVK,"as Xuan-Yun stated in his articles, Wudang Taijiquan is a intermediate sequence, learned after 1 year conditioning and basic sequence - Ji Ben Quan

This is among the best Taiji DVD.
The warm up is useful, the Zhang Zhuan is also useful.  The application is wonderful, but learning the sequence would be a challenge.
I tried to learn, but soon finding myself impossible to do it after 2,3 weeks.

Then I bought YMAA's The Essence of Taiji, do it for 2,3 weeks and everything starts to make sense.  I came to understand how you should move with Wudang Taiji and starts to pick up the sequences 1 by 1.

My advice is buy the DVD and see what Taijiquan is, train the basic first and learn the forms in this DVD later.

I can't wait to receive my preordered Wudang Kungfu - also by Xuan Yun",1255564800,4,786,4.3493150684931505
3723411,5,B001NTGZVK,The Wudang is very graceful Taiji masterfully filmed and beautifully demonstrated by Master Zhou.  A great bonus is the seperate short film introduction to the history of Tai Chi and picturesque Shaolin countryside.  Fascinating throughout.,1254960000,,240,5.828571428571428
3723412,4,B001NTGZVK,"This dvd is a terrific demonstration of Wudang tai chi. As mentioned in several of the other reviews, it does have some brief introductory material on tai chi in general and the Daoist connection with this particular teacher, but I found these a little disappointing; the data was very general, there was not a clear description of the lineage of this form, and I wanted to hear more about the Daoist connection and how/if the tai chi practice had a place in the monastic setting.

That having been said, the warm-up and meditation sections were quite good. The standing meditation is a form that I was taught under the name ""three-ball meditation"" and the moving form was new and useful.

The form itself is fascinating and incredibly well executed. I found myself constantly amazed at Master Xuan-Yun Zhou's low stances! I do think that it would be difficult to learn a form of this length and complexity from the dvd alone and wouldn't recommend buying it for that purpose. Rather, I found it valuable to watch an expert in a style with which I am not familiar demonstrating elements both familiar and unfamiliar to me. I've studied Yang and Simplified Yang, so it was a treat to see how this master and style change the emphasis and redistribute various elements from what I'm used to.

In summary, if you're a beginner wanting to learn a tai chi form, other titles like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Simplified-Tai-chi-Chuan-with-Applications-YMAA/dp/B000BL02F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Simplified Tai chi Chuan with Applications (YMAA)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taijiquan-Classical-Yang-Style-DVD-YMAA-Tai-Chi-Dr-Yang-Jwing-Ming/dp/B0000CEUY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taijiquan, Classical Yang Style DVD (YMAA Tai Chi) Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming</a>&nbsp;will serve you better.

3723413,4,B001NTGZVK,"Wudang taichi looks closer to Yang than Chen to me. And I find that strange since yang is definitely recognized as an offshoot of chen. Don't know much about Wudang except its link to the famous Taoist mountain; hence, my interest in this dvd. My teacher teaches Wudang TaiChi and watching senior students practice it, this dvd looks quite similar. But, alas my Chinese and his English make a coherent discussion seem out of reach at the moment. To me it looks like an advanced form of Yang. But I know so little.
The dvd itself is well produced, form definition is clear. A major plus is the examples of application. The martial heart of Tai Chi is under stressed in the U.S. and the multitude of interpretations of the forms needs more study. This helps.
I would not recommend this to a beginner, but certainly to any advanced practitioner. Research, not how-to.

I give it 4 stars due to rating inflation; 3 - small yes, 4 - yes, 5 - great.",1246406400,3,943,4.482558139534884
3723414,4,B001NTGZVK,"This DVD contains a wealth of information which could take much time to digest. The beginning of the DVD puts Tai Chi into historical perspective with visually stunning scenes from China. My favorite part is the sections on Warm-up, Standing and Moving Meditation. Even if I have limited time, I can incorporate these into my routine. My only criticism is that this DVD may be geared to someone who has studied Tai Chi before and wants to delve deeper. For example, the martial applications of the forms are interesting but may not be necessary for a true beginner. Having said this, some beginners may prefer to know the practical application of each form. You should also be aware that while the moves look simple, there are subtleties which should be explored. This is an issue endemic in all instructional DVDs. The viewer could decide to pursue further study through personal instruction. Nevertheless, a solid production.",1245628800,3,927,4.987096774193549
3723415,5,B001NTGZVK,"This is a review of Wudang Taijiquan, from YMAA. As usual this DVD meets the high standards I have come to expect from YMAA publications. This DVD is very comprehensive, and has a very useful menu that allows you to jump to different sections of the DVD. The DVD is broken up into six catergories. The first section is a biography of the film's performer, the Daoist monk Xuan Yu. The second section of the DVD is comprised of avery imformative lecture, on taiji, Daoism, and Wudang arts. The third and fourth sections are a comprehensive warm-up including streching, standing meditation, and moving meditation. The fifth section is the form, first demonstrated outside all the way through; followed by a classroom demonstration, which is broken into sections and includes the name of each movement. The final section of the DVD is applications, showing one application for each movement of the form. The applications are done slowly, and at full speed. They are also clearly explained, with some possible variations.",1243728000,3,1017,5.023668639053255
3723416,4,B001NTGZVK,"I was very impressed with Xuan-Yun Zhou's DVD on instruction in Tai Chi Chuan. It isn't very often one comes across a demonstration of this ""gentle"" martial art in which the combative applications are demonstrated. Mr. Zhou, however took what at times seems to be a rather esoteric practice and put it into practical terms for the western viewer.

From the beginning of the lessons, he goes to great lengths to explain how import warming up and meditation are to get the most out of your practice. He then goes on to explain and demonstrate various methods of preparing the body for the following lessons in exercise. He also gave a great and simple explanation for how important meditation is and even demonstrated two different ways to acheive meditative states depending on if you have trouble maintaining one position for long periods of time.

The individual movements were explained and demonstrated clearly as units and then displayed as one continuous form, both giving the viewer the opportunity to learn and follow along at his own pace eventually reaching the point where he can go right along with the teacher.

In the end came the martial applications of Tai Chi. With the help of two assitants, Mr. Zhou showed just how effective this martial art is as a form of self defense. Each defense/counter is explained in depth, so the viewer can get a good grasp on what is happening through each movement.

I'll be watching this DVD again and again.",1243728000,4,1457,4.816
3723417,4,B001NTGZVK,"I found this DVD to be a rare treat, as there is not a lot of information available to Western audiences on Wudang Taiji, and what there IS available is usually of poor quality.  YMAA has done us all a real service by presenting this art in such a beautiful, informative manner.  The DVD is well produced and easy to navigate (like nearly all the YMAA DVD's I've seen).  Kudos to them!  While I am very satisfied with this DVD over-all, you'll see that I did not award it a 5-Star rating.  This is due to a lack of step-by-step instruction on at least the key postures of the 108 Wudang Taiji Form.  I believe beginners might have some difficulty learning the Form from the DVD because of this.  On the other hand, I think other parts of the DVD, like the Zhan Zhuang / Dong Zhuang (Standing Meditation) and the Self-Defense Applications could be learned and performed by people of all skill levels.  (In my opinion, the nearly 40 Self-Defense Applications Master Zhou demonstrates would be worth the price of this DVD ALONE!)",1242864000,4,1026,4.538043478260869
3723418,5,B001NTGZVK,Very good video. One of the better Taijiquan videos out there. He explains the form very well. The practical part of the video is also informative.,1242864000,2,147,4.6923076923076925
3723419,5,B001NTGZVK,"If you are looking for an in-depth, thorough history and explanation of Taijiquan, this is the DVD for you. You get an interesting and beautiful introduction juxtaposed with beautiful scenery shots of the China we rarely see.

Daoist Monk Zhou presents an outstanding demonstration of the art of Wudang Taijiquan. The forms are performed in a manner which are clear, explained well and can be followed by the student. This is probably more for the intermediate to advanced student rather than a pure beginner. However, the novice student can learn a lot from viewing the history and explanatory exposition of the art.

The DVD contains warm-up segments, stretching and the forms. As in Qui Kung, there are meditations and breathing exercises. All of these are quite easy to follow and recommended for all levels of students.

This is not a quick exercise to be performed before going off to work but the DVD is invaluable for anyone who wishes to become a serious student of Taijquan. A great value for the money.",1240704000,2,1013,4.877906976744186
3723420,4,B001NTGZVK,"In this DVD, Zhou Xuan-Yun demonstrates the Wudang style Taijiquan in a clear comprehensive manner. It should be noted that unless you have prior experience with a Taiji Quan style, this material might come off as too difficult for a beginner.

First and foremost, a bit more history on the style would have been helpful. While a standard history of Taiji Quan is given, it does not specifically tell the origins of the Wudang style, but rather of general Taiji Quan. There are numerous styles claiming Wudang lineage, so a bit more background information would have been a welcome addition.

On the plus side, the DVD is of superb quality, and the visuals of Wudang Shan, and Taoist temples is stunning. You also get a brief introduction to Taoism as a philosophy and a religion. There isn't too much information to muddle and side-track the listener, but just enough to add flavor and background to the information presented.

Not to nit-pick, but there were a few parts where the  voice-over narration was slightly different from what the subtitles were showing. For example, at  3:20, during the history discussion, the voice over stated that Taiji existed for thousands of years, while the subtitles state it existed for 600. (Historian Tang Hao's research has shown it to be closer to 400.)

The form is shown quite vividly, with names accompanying each movement. You only get a front view of the demonstration, a back view would have been very helpful. In addition, the step by step lesson is merely the form performed in relative slow motion. A brief explanation of the movement might have been good. Regardless, the form is an amazing display of fluidity and jing, with very obvious martial applications.

On that note, the second part of the DVD shows martial applications to each technique. The chin-na and take downs are very  practical and realistic. This alone makes the DVD worth it's weight in gold, as these techniques are applicable to other Taiji styles.

In conclusion, this is a great DVD. The form is beautiful, fluid, and energetic. It contains all of the elements of traditional Taiji Quan, and shows Taiji's potential in fast motion as a combatative art. Highly recommended for intermediate to advanced practitioners.",1239580800,21,2242,4.957333333333334
3723421,5,B001NTGZVK,"Having recently come from a martial arts festival where Master Zhou taught parts of a Wudang Taijiquan and a Wudang Kung Fu form, I can honestly say this DVD is a goldmine.  It was both an honor and a privilege to be taught by him.  Being able to work closely with him and feel his power and energy really opened my eyes to the benefits of Wudang martial arts.  From a soft flowing movement that can transform into an explosive force, Master Zhou, Xuan-Yun is truly skilled.

Master Zhou first goes through the entire 108 move form and then breaks it down move by move.  Not only does he show you each separate move, he then teaches the combat application for them as well.  In this way, as Master Zhou taught in his seminar, you gain a deeper understanding of the form and, as a result, your form is tighter and more accurate.  There is also a history of Wudang martial arts as well as a background on Master Zhou.

I am a student of Shaolin Kempo and am always seeking to learn about other arts and how I can add elements from them to my style; Wudang martial arts are no exception.  The low stances are great for strengthening legs, the soft circular movements are as flowing as a gentle stream and yet as powerful as a tidal wave crashing to the shore, and the art itself is simply poetry in motion.

As soon as Master Zhou's Kung Fu DVD comes out, I'll be buying that one as well.  I can already recommend it to everyone else as a result of what I have experience in the last couple of days.  As far as this reviewer is concerned, if you read any negative reviews about this DVD, just disregard them and buy it; you won't be disappointed.",1236124800,4,1643,4.298701298701299

8327919,5,B001NTGZVK,"Great video! It could use more camera angles. When he turns his back to the camera you can't see his hands. Fortunately he has already showed these moves facing the camera. The applications of the moves are excellent. It is a practical martial art form of Taijiquan. The moves are faster than Yang style and more dynamic. It can be practiced at a slower tempo if you like. This is a more athletic form of Tai Chi Chuan.
I don't think you can learn any martial art very well from a video if you are an absolute beginner. Find a good instructor and take some classes.
A background in some form of Kung Fu or Tai Chi Chuan etc. would be helpful in learning from this video.",1460073600,2,670,4.283464566929134

8327921,5,B001NTGZVK,"This DVD is outstanding for anyone -who would like to begin; or delve deeper into the magnificent art that is TaiChiChuan/Taijiquan. I have had the honor of living in the mystical mountains of Wudang (the birthplace of TaiChi/Taijiquan) and this DVD is phenomenal reference to the Zhang Sen Feng Taijiquan 108 Sequence. It contains volumes of fantastic information about Taijiquan and martial arts in general-as well as some breathtaking footage. Ive always kept it nearby as a solid study reference. Zhou, Shifu teaches very comprehensively throughout the DVD just as if you were standing on a mountainside learning with him :-)
As far as overall quality, Ive a couple hundred martial arts DVDs that Ive collected over the years. With this DVD, like the others from DaoistGate.com, the composition, menus, angles, explanations; are really above and beyond Anything you would ever find. Its genuine sage wisdom and Shifu; Zhou, Xuan Yun will walk you through very smoothly and gracefully. Its truly magnificent!",1419552000,,1011,5.246913580246914
8327922,5,B001NTGZVK,"The form is super hard to follow, but if you slow it down in sections, and repeat, its not bad. The defensive applications is worth the purchase alone. Im glad I got the video, ive learned some variations of techniques I already knew. The standing mediation is awesome as well... Works!!",1396396800,,287,4.647058823529412
8327923,4,B001NTGZVK,"One cannot expect everything on one martial arts video. While Zhou could have given more emphasis to the concept of rending and Kou, he did at least demonstrate a considerable number of applications suitable to other forms of Taiji, especially Chen,  which obviously is the parent of the other forms. Zhou might also have given more emphasis to the use of calf, knee, thigh and hip strikes, simultaneous to striking and throwing techniques to give the student a better idea of the real power behind Taiji.
 That said, this video is still  well worth watching.
  I am not happy with YMAA, which for some reason chose to use a codec that was not compatible with almost any media player,
  Since I use Linux, and since YMAA does not stand behind purchases from other vendors, this dvd sat in a box for over a year until one of the wonderful volunteer Linux programmers wrote a codec, which by the way works beautifully.",1393200000,4,916,4.6521739130434785
8327924,4,B001NTGZVK,"I love this DVD, the instruction and all the content. However there is a couple of but. You can not see the performance from different angles or the back. And there is no slow motion like I have seen in other videos. having said so, beautiful meditative practice that is a joy to learn.",1392336000,,286,4.314814814814815
