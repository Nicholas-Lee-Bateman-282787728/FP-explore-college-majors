4404883,5,B004LRWB6O,"This is a great concert i love the acoustic setting, the music is very soothing and beautiful. Steve Hogarth takes his old songs and reworks them using acoustic instruments. if you enjoyed his less is more album then you will enjoy this one. 21 songs on two dvd's. This is a must have for any marillion fan",1318032000,2,306,4.385964912280702
4404884,5,B004LRWB6O,"Hermoso DVD doble de estos grandes exponentes del rock progresivo, en un gran local y un publico que sabe lo que esta escuchando, grande Marillion.",1317340800,,147,4.92
4404885,5,B004LRWB6O,I have the DVD and the music and emotion is awesome. It is a must have. But I think the Bluray version is only in PAL format.,1306627200,3,125,3.6666666666666665
4404886,5,B004LRWB6O,"This concert is divided in two sets, the first set is concentrated in their ""Less is more"" release in which they reinterpreted mainly ""b-sides"" for Hogart's era.  In this set all songs sounds very different than the original release with a brilliant effort from the band to reinvent their songs incorporating new arrangements with some exotic instruments such as Finger cymbals, glockenspiel, xylophone, autoharp, and hammered dulcimer played either by Hogarth, Trewavas or Kelly.  The second set starts with single ""No one can"" brilliantly played by Hogarth alone and with this interpretation simply starts the ""Marillion unplugged set"" which is really wonderful  playing some of some of their hits with simple acoustic arrangement without the innovations made with the songs of the first set.

In this release all Marillion members not only shines playing their instruments which such accuracy and intensity but also proves they enjoy playing music together, that they were born to do this job and this the reason they have kept their greatness during the last 30 years.  For me Steve Rothery and Mark Kelly has always been the main influence in the sound of Marillion, but I was kindly surprised watching Steve H Hogart playing keyboards and  percussion instruments on this release demonstrating that he is the soul of the group.

To be honest, I prefer hearing them with heavier sounds incorporating more synthesizers rather than piano, electric guitar solos instead of marimbas, but in Live From Cadogan Hall they have done such a great job that they simply amazed me.  The only complaints that I have is that they did not include in the set list any song from Fish period and sometimes the first set lacks of power and sometimes becomes boring and repetitive.

Highlights:  Out of this world, Wrapped up in time, Hard as love, This train is my life, You're gone, Gazpacho, The Answering Machine and Three Minute Boy",1369958400,,1921,5.031545741324921

4404890,5,B004LRWB6O,"It's not an umplugged. It's marillion with less ""bombastic"". All the songs are great. The vision is amazing, and the sound cannot be better. Recommended",1355270400,,152,5.12
4404891,5,B004LRWB6O,"I got this DVD for my husband because he is a MEGA Marillion fan. The day he got it I came home to hear it playing loud enough to hear outside LOL I would say this makes for a very happy husband. He loves it, magnificent was one of his descriptors. A must have for any Marillion fan!",1352246400,,283,3.896551724137931
4404892,5,B004LRWB6O,"Live from Cadogan Hall is my first Marillion DVD and was well worth the price. I do not buy concert DVD's because after I watch it once I don't get the same experience again. Not true with this release. The music is so intense and complicated I know I will enjoy it for years. Marillion is a band who has not achieved commercial success,but their international following speaks for itself. The recent world tour has sold out every venue and the band is still making quality music when their contemporaries are on the golden oldies tour. The music is topical,sophisticated and complicated speaking to the heart and emotion of a generation while finding new fans in the commonality that we are the same around the world. The production and sound quality of the DVD is superb, the editing could use a little more variety,but on the whole a very good performance which is what matters most. A couple of passages really smoked musically, but on the whole more introspective than the normal electric set. A must for any Marillion afficinado or music fan who is tired of the same songs thirty years later from other bands. (No I don't work for the band):)",1351900800,,1148,4.6600985221674875
4404893,4,B004LRWB6O,"To be honest I kind of lost track of Marillion for a good 15 to 20 years. I was a fan of their first two records back in high school. By misplaced childhood I thought they had gone to main stream. Then thru a freinds encouragement (who's musical tastes I respect very much) me to give their newer stuff a chance. First I picked up the Fish years records. First two were as good as I remembered and the last two with Fish were much better then I remembered them. So I moved on to the ""Hogarth"" years. The first couple of CD's he did with them really arn't for me but the later ones were much better. So me and my freind ordered this from their web site (yes these were PAL I don't know if the Amazon one is or not.). The show is mostly made up of Album ""Less Is More"" done acoustically. I was never to big on the unplugged thing. I mean when it works it's great but in most cases it doesn't. In this case it works. The sound mix on this Blu ray is beautiful.
As a bonus you get the ""Less Is More"" album in a high definition 96/24 stereo format. Nice bonus since I don't own the record. The reason I am only giving this 3.5 stars is for three reasons. First I don't think the ""Hogarth"" records are near as interesting as the ones done with Fish. I am not putting him or Marillion in general down. But to me they are almost two different Band's. I am not saying the ""Hogarth"" period is bad just different. Second is the confusion about the format of the disc. With the lack or misinformation Amazon lists you never know what you are getting. Which brings me to my third complant. Seriously over $40.00 for a single Blu Ray. That is nuts.
I would have preferred a regular show for the Blu ray and not the acoustic evening with that we got. But I have to admit it is really good. Great way to kick back and mellow your mind.",1334102400,,1819,4.098039215686274
4404894,5,B004LRWB6O,"Excellent show...beautiful arrangements that were stripped down, torn apart and put back together again.  Outstanding performance, leaves me wanting more...wish I was there.",1332720000,,173,6.521739130434782
4404895,5,B004LRWB6O,I got the Blu-ray edition today and it works just fine on my Samsung player. The disc is Region 0 (region-free) and it works on a regular U.S. Blu-ray player. I do not like acoustic concerts much but I am really glad I bought it. I LOVE this one! Great concert! Excellent sound and video quality. Highly recommended.,1332547200,2,316,4.4655172413793105

8434804,4,B004LRWB6O,"I like the content, but am less than thrilled with the play ability of the disc. Don't know if its the fault of the format or the crappy Sony BD player. The Sony can't load it at all. I do have a Panasonic BD in the other room and it plays it without issue. This is the only BD that the Sony has failed to load.

Anyway great concert, I'd give it the full 5 stars if I could listen on my other system.",1445817600,,401,3.7738095238095237
