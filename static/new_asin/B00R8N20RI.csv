8694570,1,B00R8N20RI,"This review is of the 2014 Mutant Sorority DVD.
""Track of the Vampire"" is an alternate version of the movie ""Blood Bath"" that was expanded to 78 minutes for TV release. This DVD claims an 80-minute running time, which is false: it runs just over 72 minutes. The pre-credits sequence and the original credits are missing, replaced by a video burn of the title; cast and crew are never listed. The first sequence on this disc is a vampire attack originally occurring much later in the film.
In addition, the actor's movements are jerky, suggesting that this came from a European video source that received a sloppy PAL transfer. The claim of digital remastering is also false; this came from a scratchy, spotty, spliced 16mm print.
Avoid this disc at all costs. The best sources for this title remain Sinister Cinema (which isn't available on Amazon as of this writing) and the now out-of-print Madacy disc, where it was paired with ""Nightmare Castle.""",1444953600,4,950,4.8343558282208585
