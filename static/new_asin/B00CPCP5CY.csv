8584451,4,B00CPCP5CY,"This is a fun & terrific movie. I first saw it in 2006 at the San Francisco Independent Film Festival. John was out on the sidewalks pitching and promoting his movie to anyone - and everyone! - who walked by. As a result, he had sellout crowds at both of the screenings of ""Johnny Montana."" And the crowds loved it!

John Daniel Gavin plays Johnny Montana, a young guy from a New York borough who's trying to find his place in the world. Not having any particular skill or talent, young Montana tries taking the world on as a stud for hire, only to find that by selling his body he is also selling his soul.

In addition to playing the lead role of Johnny Montana, John Daniel Gavin wrote and directed this movie and displays genuine talent. He made ""Johnny Montana"" guerrilla-style over the course of a year and it's a film that still stands out among the independent movie scene for its storytelling and performances. He throws in lots of surprises that keep you watching.

You can also see John as himself taking ""Johnny Montana"" on the film festival circuit in the wonderful and insightful documentary ""Official Rejection"" about the dirty truths behind the film festival world - and he's the standout in that film as well.

Since first seeing this movie I've often wondered when I'd be able to get a copy of it for my DVD shelf. I have to say that ""Johnny Montana"" still holds up - and it was worth the wait. It both looks - and sounds - better here than I remembered.

A terrific coming-of-age film that's well worth your time. I'm glad to -- finally! -- be able to add this to my film collection. It's been worth the wait.",1368144000,,1628,4.431438127090301
8584452,5,B00CPCP5CY,"I was fortunate enough to view Johnny Montana at the San Francisco Indie Festival, and was totally blown away by it. I have never seen a more authentic depiction of New York City, in both the visual shots of city locations, or in the characters portrayed in the film. Having grown up in New York, I have known many similar people as those in this film, and I can say with complete certainty that these are the most authentic NYC characters I have ever seen on film. Films such as ""Pope of Greenwich Village"", ""Mean Streets"", and ""Lords of Flatbush"" pale in comparison with ""Johnny Montana"" when it comes to capturing the grittiness and realism of the city. I was also impressed with the music in this film, which effectively draws you into the story and holds you transfixed until the very end.

To sum up, if you love films, see ""Johnny Montana"". It will restore your faith in film as art.",1368057600,,890,4.493827160493828
