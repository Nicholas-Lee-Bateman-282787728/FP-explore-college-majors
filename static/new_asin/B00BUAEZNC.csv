Anyway, originally gave it three stars on an intermediate level but after giving it a few more plays wanted to upgrade to five stars. There is some good stuff on here for anybody that appreciates Les or Django or bebop. And these ideas can be modified according to your own ability. So get this thing and start playing!!",1421539200,,376,4.463768115942029
