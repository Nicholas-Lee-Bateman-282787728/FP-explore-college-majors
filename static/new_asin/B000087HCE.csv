7979655,5,B000087HCE,"This is a progressive video starting from the basic tele stance all the way through jumps and tricks.

I have a background in Alpine skiing and snowboarding but this video really helped me transition into telemark quickly.  I have watched it countless times, it is exciting and as a film maker myself (very well shot and edited) I do not get bored watching this ever, not like you would expect from an instructional video.

Also, only 2 years on tele's, I still revert to it frequently.  I will do so for years to come as until I can do some of the amazing tricks these guys do in the park.

The best money I have spent on instruction ever.",1332720000,,640,4.34453781512605
7979656,4,B000087HCE,"It is an great ""how to"" movie on freeheel technique. Not intended for Piste skiers or Nordic skiers. It covers the basics to experts freeriding.",1169078400,,144,4.8
7979657,5,B000087HCE,"The earlier reviewer does not use the same definition of ""free heel"" skiing.  I found this to be an excellent, the best I found, instructional video of modern telemark skiing in all kinds of different conditions.  Filmed in some great locations, with detailed and helpful tips on body position, balance, and stance.  You will definitely improve your telemark skiing!",1168300800,2,366,5.169491525423729
7979658,5,B000087HCE,"As described by the review above this video is NOT for nordic or skate skiers!!! Modern freeheel technique and nordic/crosscountry/skate skiing acually have very little in common. Once you understand what this video is for then you can appreciate its value.

It is the only instructional video on modern freeheel technique that I know of, and although it can't teach you how to ski, it has valuable tips for all telemark skiers of all levels and all abilities. It covers everything from the very basics to full on big mountain freeriding. If you are looking to improve you telemark technique and style then this video is for you.",1133827200,19,629,4.824074074074074
7979659,2,B000087HCE,My husband and I did not like this video. In our opinion there is no instructional value or race footage. I can't see how this type of product is useful to learning to nordic ski since there is no uphill or flat track technique.,1116374400,,228,4.204545454545454
