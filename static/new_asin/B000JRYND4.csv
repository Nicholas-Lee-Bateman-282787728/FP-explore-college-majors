8152721,3,B000JRYND4,I used to go to a bar years ago that showed nothing but surf footage all day. This is the closest i've come to that yet. A little short but a great video nonetheless for those who enjoy surfing videos without all the commentary.,1238284800,2,228,4.204545454545454
8152722,3,B000JRYND4,"Just got back from the North Shore and was missing it. Saw the video and bought it. Its fast paced with no narration, just tunes. It was short only 30 minutes with only quick views of Halewia and none of the bay! . Its just basic nice waves and surfing. I was disappointed because a video is needed catching the whole vibe of the North shore Area. The story and feel beyond the great surfing. The Real shaved ice, the shrimp trucks, the ranch, the small great restaurants and the local ""underground"" flavor. Even hit on the locals vs. high rise development angle. Its a treasure, and by the way don't go.",1178409600,,604,4.401785714285714
