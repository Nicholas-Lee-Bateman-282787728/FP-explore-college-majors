6448550,5,B00KU3Y2VK,"Just hope the price goes down to 25 like part 1. But great anime, I am buying both parts so i can watch it wherever i go.",1405123200,3,121,3.5185185185185186
6448551,5,B00KU3Y2VK,Attack on Titan is an adrenalin filled joy ride of awesomeness! I would recommend it to anyone looking for the next great show to watch.,1404864000,3,136,4.48
6448552,3,B00KU3Y2VK,"The second half of AOT begins with Eren and Misaka joining the Scout division in order to try to reclaim Wall Rose and to discover the secret of his being able to turn into Rogue Titan.  However as they head to their hometown, they are attacked by a new titan, who is definately female in origin.  Why is this new titan popping up, and why is she only focused on Eren - possibly the last hope humanity has left?

I watched the full series on crunchyroll and of course rewatching on adult swim.  Honestly it is an okay series, while the animation is good and the voice actors are decent, the story gets very predictable and the only characters worth watching are Arden and Misaka.  And while it took three episodes for them to figure out who Female Titan was, I figured it out in 5 mintues - and I don't read the manga. i know a lot of people will be negative towards me as i give this honest review as I just don't fall into the belief that this was a extraordinary series, but then I have watched anime for many more years than most people have been alive and have seen many good and bad series over the years, there are several that I would say was better than AOT, like DNAngel and the Black Bullet series for better story and characters.

We will have to see when season two comes out to see the fall of the last wall and the final struggle if the series gets better.",1404777600,14,1371,4.213740458015267
6448553,5,B00KU3Y2VK,"Not to kill this great gem of an anime with hype or anything, but it's just that good. I've seen a lot of anime, and Attack on Titan easily ranks in my personal top 10 anime of all time, maybe even the top 5.

If you're already a fan of the series, then you know what to expect; however, if you're new and bought the first part of season one on a whim, you should absolutely get this second part. As great as the first part of this season is, the second half continues to take things to a whole new level, with even more surprises, action, and grim encounters to keep you glued to the edge of your seat.

To touch on the animation, over all artwork and background environments, I have to say that Attack on Titan is drop-dead gorgeous (despite it's grim and gritty setting/story). There is a SUPERB amount of detail that I've only seen in the likes of Angel Beats. Every frame is a priceless scene in its own right, and the animators/art team that brought this story to life should be praised!

Unfortunately, I can't comment on the performances of the English voice actors (I'm just now getting around to ordering Part 1 since it dropped in price briefly), but, like always, the Japanese actors are superb. I'm a little biased with the voice-over tracks, though.

Lastly, if you're reading and have not seen the first part or don't even know what, exactly, Attack on Titan is about, do yourself a favor and just watch the first episode on YouTube or an anime streaming sight. If you're a fan of a captivating world with an interesting history, relatable characters, and grueling battles where anything can happen, then you WILL NOT be disappointed.

I would classify this as a survival horror/action/superpower genre of anime, although the action isn't quite in the same vein as, say... DBZ, Bleach, One Piece, or Yu Yu Hakusho. Attack on Titan is definitely a shonen manga/anime, but there's more to it than meets the eye.",1404345600,62,1924,4.565217391304348
6448554,1,B00KU3Y2VK,Series is ok not as great as everyone goes on and on. Check it out first it's free to watch everywhere Hulu Crunchyroll Netflix. This is one of these series that people will make you think that if you don't like it then you know nothing about anime when the reality is that most people that do don't themselves.,1404345600,33,311,4.288135593220339
6448555,5,B00KU3Y2VK,"To begin, my five star rating is a reflection of the show, and not of the box set, which i suppose could seem backwards from what it should be. Honestly though if you are considering buying this then chances are you are already a fan, or have seen this amazing show already to the end. In which case we all know just how good it is, and how its story and action, and presentation flow, and really break the mold of many modern day anime. I can guarantee that having this in your collection will not be a bad thing, and the re-watchability to the show is great.

Music: 5
Story: 5
Characters: 5
Action/Animation: 10!!

Now we come to what we are all actually purchasing, ""and yes I have this pre ordered like many of you will too""...And that is part 2 box set."" why you wouldn't get this on blu-ray is beyond me"". What I have come to expect, and realize is that its all about money/business. In short anime like this one, that only last 25 episodes they are always cut in half and sold separately to maximize profit. Then a year down the road Funimation will undoubted release a ""complete collection"" that has, ironically, the complete first season which was always a complete first season to begin with, that they just so happened to split in half and sell separately to us. The anime AOT season 1 is 24 episodes, and was never broken up when it originally aired. So that is why my rating for this box set is...
Part 2 blu-ray set: 2
For huge fans of the series you will most likely get this any way, but I just know i will have the urge to get the ""full"" set when it comes out in a year with all 24 episodes. Damn business practices, and no i don't beleive for a second that this is because they didn't have all 24 episodes dubbed yet. That is certainly not the case.",1403913600,11,1768,4.243323442136498

As time goes on you may eventually be able to purchase the entire season in one go, but given that the series is still relatively new, at least from a dubbed standpoint, it's a good buy. Discs include both dubbed and subbed versions, picture is clear, and I personally enjoyed the extras, particularly the animated chibi shorts. I admittedly enjoyed the chibi shorts in this package more than I did the first, but that's mostly attributed to the fact that more of my favorite characters didn't show up until the last half of the first season.

6448679,3,B00KU3Y2VK,"The anime Attack on Titan is clearly a huge phenomenon, and has been from some time now. Arguably one of the biggest animes of recent memory, everybody seems to be talking about it. There is a live-action movie about to come out in Japan, it was featured in a car commercial, theres an exhibit of it at Universal Studios Japan, and you cant go to any comic/anime/nerd convention without seeing whole squads of fans in cosplay of the series characters. There was even a recent crossover with Marvel Comics. This series, the anime and the manga, and its fandom are as massive as the Colossal Titan. I myself have seen the dubbed version of every episode of the anime thus far, and have even read a great deal of translated scans of the manga. Ive also frequently browsed the Wiki for the series and taken a look at several articles about the series on various anime websites, blogs, and videos on review channels. However, even after all of that, in spite of it, or perhaps because of it, Im still not sure whether or not I even like Attack on Titan.

I would think this rather odd. Usually a person can decide whether or not they like a particular show after a few or so episodes, or a book after a couple of chapters. But Ive seen or read most everything official about Attack on Titan and I still don't know if I like it, or even if its a good series. There is a lot about this series that I find frustrating and sometimes even repugnant, but I still find myself watching new episodes or reading new chapters when I find them. Perhaps its that macabre sense of interest like staring at a freeway accident or something, but this series keeps drawing me back in.

There are some things about this series that I do objectively like. I absolutely love the art design of the human characters in the anime. It is far and away some of the most aesthetically pleasing art of people that I have seen in an anime in a long time. Its realistic in the sense that theres little to no exaggerated appearances, and none of that stereotypical anime colored hair. The shadows and shading highlight the features beautifully and expressions are believable without being too cartoony. I also really like some of the main characters. Mikasa is good strong female character for a new generation, and her steadfastness and loyalty are admirable. I also like Erens determination and resolve. Sasha is a good comedic foil for a lot of the dark and harsh things going on in this world. I also like how the characters are actively trying to fight back against the monsters hunting them, rather than simply always flee in terror.

But there are a lot more things about this series that I don't like, and thats not just for the sake of loving to hate something. Aside from what I just said, the art design of the manga is just ugly to my eyes. Too many streaks and it takes shadows to the extreme to the point that human expressions are hideous. Furthermore, I really cant stand the designs of the titular Titans. They just look too bizarre. Giant naked people with no junk seems like a lazy design blueprint to me, with only exaggerated proportions to differentiate them, although the Titan Shifter designs seem much more varied but still grotesque. They cross over the uncanny valley in my opinion, but I relent that was probably the intent of the creator, to make them close to humans but still monstrous and ugly enough to be very disturbing.

Another thing about this series is its very dark themes and gory content. I have heard this series referred to as Japans own Walking Dead, and I can certainly see why. Death, betrayal, cowardice, selfishness, and basically all the negative aspects of the human condition are out in full force. Most of the time, its a very hopeless and dreary-toned story, with hardly any light moments to help balance out that magnitude of despair the characters face. I prefer fiction to be a vehicle for good, showcasing and promoting the better aspects of the human condition and condemning evil rather than have it as a main focus. As with the comparison to the Walking Dead, don't get too attached to most characters, as the death toll is high and the death knoll rings often. Some were predictable and some were surprising, but just about every person you see practically has a countdown clock above their heads until they're Titan chow. Its almost as if the story is more intent on snuffing out every pleasant aspect of the story even more so than the Titans themselves. I believe that character deaths shouldnt happen so frivolously, unless it would mean something to the story or another characters growth. That is not the case here, as one of the central themes of the story is that human suffering and these characters sacrifices are ultimately meaningless.

However, far and away this series greatest weakness is the mystery, but its probably also its greatest draw. Right from the get-go, this series asks a ton of questions, as most successful fiction would. What are the Titans? Where did they come from? How do they function? Why do they do what they do? What exactly are the Walls? Who built them and when? What is in Dr. Yeager cellar? What happened to humanity before the appearance of the Titans? Further down the road, the story asks more questions. What happened to Eren and how? What exactly is the Beast Titan? Where do the Titan Shifters come from? What are they after and why? How do they function differently from other Titans? What is the secret of the Royal Family? What does it have to do with Eren? A lot of questions. And 60-something large manga chapters, 26 anime episodes, and few short OVAs later, we as readers/viewers still know the answers to hardly any of those questions. We have been told little to nothing about what the devil is going on. If anything, we know even less as more scenarios and characters are introduced without clarifying what and who weve already seen. Even basic concepts like exactly when and where this story takes place go unaddressed. This story has been around for nearly six years, and is nearly  of the way done according to the creator, and I am just as confused as I first was when I saw the first episode. Other stories do not treat their mysteries this way. For example, in Harry Potter, we knew more or less what was going on and how the world worked by the end of Book 1; the characters and setting were established and the immediate conflict resolved with the foundation of the overall plot laid down. Other questions would prop up and be answered with respective time and the plot progressed at a speed to keep readers informed but still interested. If Harry Potter were like Attack on Titan in its structure, then we still wouldnt have known how magic works or who and what the villains were even after Book 5. Attack on Titan plays out, in my opinion, more like Lost. Big questions are asked right at the start, still aren't answered well into the series run, and the plot just gets more and more confusing and convoluted as time goes on, with even more unanswered questions being presented.

Still, perhaps that is the point. I realize that this is the reason I still read/watch the series even though I am not a fan of a lot of its elements. I am very frustrated with this series structure, and its the desire to alleviate that very frustration that keeps me coming back to it. I hate that I don't know whats going on, but darn it all, I want to know what the heck is going on! I suppose that also makes it like Lost. So, despite my dislike for much of the tone, themes, and structure of Attack on Titan, I am still enthralled enough to keep buying into it. I guess its sort of a macabre cautious interest that I have with it. It can be a very interesting puzzle to solve, but it certainly not for everyone, especially the queasy or faint- or sensitive-of-heart, as the darkness and gore are pushed to the nth degree here. If you're a fan of enigmas, secrets, or intrigue, then check it out. If you prefer stories of heroism, clear morality, or those that champion the goodness of the human spirit, or if you wouldnt like seeing more blood than every entry in the Friday the 13th and Saw series combined, then avoid this series like a Titan. In the end, these are not the kind of Titans I would want to Remember, but they do make for a good Clash though.",1427760000,10,8338,4.547270306258322
6448680,5,B00KU3Y2VK,I purchased the standard edition and it was great!. It came with both dvd and blu ray disks. The extras were great and wow this show looks amazing in blu ray quality on an HD tv. This is a great buy. Both the dvd and the blu ray disks had japanese audio and subtitles (so i don't get why some people claim the blu ray disks don't have japanese audio because they do have it). This show is great in japanese i advice people to watch the japanese audio with the english subtitles but its all up to you. Either way you get both options.

6448685,4,B00KU3Y2VK,"Firstly, I would have given this product a 5 star rating, if not for one major omission. If you plan to be watching the Blu-Ray disks, do NOT expect to be able to change the language or add subtitles. The Blu-Ray disks of this anime do not include Japanese languages NOR do they include English subtitles. On the Blu-Ray versions there is only English audio with no subtitles. This was a massive disappointment, as I didn't really care for the dubbing/voice acting done for the English audio on this anime, but it was bearable and the Marathon Mode was a very welcome feature. This anime looks absolutely stunning on Blu-Ray in 1080p, even more so than I thought it looked on Netflix for sure. The case is good quality and the disks are all secure and the artwork is nice. This is still worth it, but be aware that the Japanese audio and the English subtitles are not on the Blu-Ray disks, they are, however, on the DVD disks of the show, which makes no sense to me, but that's a question for Funimation. Definitely worth the pick up still even if just for the DVD copies.",1426032000,2,1072,4.446700507614213

Nope, Jeff H. didn't buy me this for Channukah because it was sold out everywhere he looked for it.  Remember, iPhone 6 aside, he's still Jeff-of-the-20th Century who doesn't shop at Amazon!
""Attack on Titan - Part Two"" deftly picks up where Part One left off.  Eren is on trail for his life.  Surviving Humanity is fearfu that he is a spy for other Titans in their midist.  It doesn't matter that Eren acted in his Titan form to save lives, not take them.
SPOILER ALERT!
In a daring plan that almost fails, Eren is given a chance to prove himself and earn his freedom; but the consipiracy that almost ended his military training years ago comes full bloom when a female Titan appears and this one, unlike the male Titan's, with the exception of Eren, is deadly intelligent.
""Attack on Titan - Part Two""  deftly continues the mix of horror, intrigue, and hope amongst Humanity's survivors and sets up the next story line which I hope will be forthcoming by 2016, since it ends leaving you wanting more of this innovative anime series.

6448708,5,B00KU3Y2VK,"There are many reasons why this anime are so popular in Japan. But the most elementary reason is that the despairs Ellen has are the same to
those that the young have.
Titans are cruel,strong and infringe upon their rights. It is possible for humans in this world only to grieve and stand their tragedy fate.
In Japan , I think titans are like Japanese black corporations.
Many young workers are forced to work for very long hours without being paid and holidays.
Of course , some workers have mental problems ,some workers committe suicides.
Probably,they want to resist ,but they cannot do because they don't have other choices to live .
But Ellen trys to fight his fate. So the young in Japan identify with Ellen and can become brave .

6448746,4,B00KU3Y2VK,This is anime is of course AMAZING.But it lost 1 star for one important detail. PART 2 IS SHORT AS HELL!! Im so irritated right now. The whole part consist of 1 mission outside the second wall. The rest is all talking and flashbacks! The 1st disc has more episodes than the 2nd. I spent so long waiting for this to release in English. And I was done with it in a few hours. So let down..Says on back. Japans Walking Dead!!! Bull****.Walking Dead gives 16 episodes in a season. Im tired of waiting! And the story plot announced in the 1st episode. Erens Key. Is still never checked out. But they say they're going too...Very disappointed with this part.,1415404800,,652,4.441666666666666

6448748,4,B00KU3Y2VK,"One of my favorite series. I know it gets some flack, but at least it isn't another moe/harem/slice of life anime. I had no problem with packaging or discs on this order. The only problem which I took a star off for were many of funimation's voice actor pics for the characters, and some odd decisions made by the voice directors. For a quick example listen to rouge titan's voice and roars in English then listen to them in Japanese. The higher pitch turns something from intimidating to what you would expect to hear come out of a kid rage quitting on xbox live.  Mikasa's English voice from Trina Nishimura has ups and downs. It's not horrible, but it was an odd call for the voice actors to change the personality slightly. In the Sub Mikasa is fairly stoic and monotone. It makes for moments when she breaks down all them more emotional. In the English Version Mikasa's voice shows a lot more emotional range. It takes her a bit further away from being a stoic character and is far from monotone. It's really only a minor problem if you started with the manga and sub before you watched the dub, as it makes the changes more apparent.  However Levi's voice by Matthew Mercer even with just the dub isn't a good fit at all. It's far too deep for the characters body build and sounds pretty old. Yeah Levi is older than the rookies, but this voice makes him sound old enough to be their father. It's almost to the extent of had they used english Bradley's voice for Ed in FMA for the whole series and never brought up why Ed sounded so old.

Either way it's a great series and the name of the show actually delivers. This time they are actually attacking titans not defending from them.",1415232000,5,1689,4.42443729903537

6448754,5,B00KU3Y2VK,"I don't have a lot of experience with Anime, because I haven't really watched it but what I have seen was good.  My son was telling me about ""Attack on Titan"", he really wanted to watch this so I figured we could as a team.  The story is good, unique, and the characters are interesting.  The Titans are very creepy looking, like average business men and giant small children that want to eat you.  They did a good job of dubbing this in English.
I guess the odd part is the lack of Japanize.  Its a giant walled city in Japan, with people that speak Japanese, write Japanese but are all Caucasian.  They even make reference to the last Asian woman but she was eaten by a Titan.  Maybe its a part of the plot line that hasn't been revealed yet.

I know, I know; now all the anime hipsters are going to come and hate on this post along with other people who loved this anime- saying how it's over-hyped garbage & that ""real anime"" blah blah blah. But you know what? Sometimes good is good, and this anime is good; veeeerrry good.

The animation is GORGEOUS, if anything else, you can zone out and just admire the art. The storyline is very engaging (which as well all know- is  hard to find in anime...), and surprisingly has decent character development (which as we all know is rare in anime). There are some parts that feel drawn out- but hey- it's aniiimmme!!. There are some parts that don't quite make sense- but hey- it's annniimmmeee!!!

The Japanese voice actors are awesome , without too too many high-pitched make your ears bleed female voices,  along w/very good subtitles (no Samrui Champloo or Soul Eater action w/ misspelled words or sentences that don't make sense). The English voice actors are also very good.

Overall- just an awesome awesome series. I don't normally waste money on buying movies/shows etc; preferring to find other means to watch them....; nor do I ever really watch something more than once. But this- this I'd actually cough up the money to buy and watch it again, so as to support the series so there are no awful filler arcs.",1412553600,3,1350,4.679324894514768
6448771,5,B00KU3Y2VK,"Well, here we have another installment of the Attack on Titan series, and I must say, this did not disappoint. I will not divulge any spoilers, so there isn't much I can say, but this series lives up to the hype if you ask me. Artwork is unique and amazing, the English dub is great and the score matches as well! Not often does a series that hits on all fronts come around, but I found it in AOT. For those who criticize the fact that this is just titan attacks and nothing more, you are ignorant. You miss the bigger picture and the entire premise behind the whole series. I would bet you also missed the greatness of other masterpieces like Evangelion, didn't you? Off on a tangent. Anyways, AOT is more than worth the money. Cheaper than part one too! Although there was no 3D art card included with this set it is a great addition to my collection. Support the American anime market and pick this up today!

6448772,5,B00KU3Y2VK,"Attack on Titan Season 1 part 2 is amazing from start to finish. This is coming from a guy who is not even a huge fan of anime, yet this series delivers in every regard. The story and characters are well written with the series throwing some revelations at you to shock you. You follow Eren Jaeger and his friends as they try to survive the harsh world of giant mile high humanoid titans bent on consuming humanity. The action scenes are some of the best show casing fluent animations in such large scale battles with these titans. However not everything is perfect some characters are more developed than others and some episodes are filer. But those are small complaints that don't kill the series or make lose its charm. It is a nice new anime that does some completely original. The extras that come with this Blu-ray are basic two commentaries, some trailers, a short series, and music videos its nice but not worth it for just those features.

Usually when an anime becomes mainstream, I avoid it like the plague. But something about this anime caught my attention and I just could NOT get it out of my head until I had watched some of it.

This anime is AMAZING. From the art, to the soundtrack, to the storyline... I honestly have to say this is in my top favorites, which very rarely changes. If you are looking for a new anime that can get you to the edge of your seat, this is it. I gladly bought parts one and two, even after I had said a long time ago that I was never going to watch it.

6448781,4,B00KU3Y2VK,"Just finished viewing AOT Pt 2 ... amazing anime ... brutal, bloody action sequences ... beautifully drawn back ground and characters ... story line has a bit of a twist and the conclusion leaves a lot of questions unanswered.  So bring on seasons 3 & 4!

That being said, I have a huge problem with Eren - or with his hesitation to take action.  Why Eren, why?  Your inability to take action costs a lot of people their lives!  Struggling with your humanity?  But these are monsters that you are dealing with - where is their humanity?  You fight monsters with monsters!  Anyway, wasn't it Eren, early on, that said to the effect that he wanted to ...""kill all Titans""?",1411084800,,670,4.525
6448782,5,B00KU3Y2VK,"First, I'll say that I'm really surprised that this show became as big as it did. The pace is rather slow, there is a lot of death, and I've heard complaints that the characters are flat. The setting is very dismal, and the story is not yet finished (even in the manga).

This is the second half to the anime adaptation of ""Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan),"" following up almost immediately from the end of the first half. It begins mostly in explanation and preparation -- this will last a few good episodes. But when they actually get out into the field, I find things to get very interesting.

From around episode 17 and on, there will be a lot of action and explanations (mostly in tactics and formation). You will not have any real ground breaking information except small bits here and there, and of course, near the end. >However< if you pay attention, you can actually uncover a lot more that is not yet covered (that has been revealed in the manga), so there is a good amount of foreshadowing.

While I personally love this adaptation, and have closely followed the manga for 3 years, I would advise watching the first 9 episodes of the first half on Crunchyroll if you're interested. You might find it too dismal, you might find it boring, or you may fall in love with it. I'm a guy that enjoys Gundam, and I would say that would be the closest anime genre to this, if that helps you at all.

A final note: The soundtrack and animation really are at the quality of a movie. I doubt you'll be disappointed in either of those two.",1410566400,,1542,4.419014084507042
6448783,2,B00KU3Y2VK,"Death, death, death and more death.  Sad death, tragic death, sudden death, meaningless death.  The Titans kill but the real killers are always men.  A female Titan(unknown previously)causes a massacre and chaos.  Eren fights and sees those around him die miserably.  It is painful to watch.  Without knowing I can tell that there is a lot of political intrigue in the future and that the Titans are just someone's tool to get and keep power.  Some power-drunk fool who doesn't care how much mankind suffers as long as he/she/they get to be on top of the dung-heap.  I hate to see decent characters butchered after just enough screen time for me to give a damn.  It is Shakespearean.

It is sad.

I can handle tragedy and horror and death(Hellsing is that way)but this is meaningless and numbing.  I never understood why people like this series, and the way it crawls just makes it worse.  Spending 8 episodes so in an outing to get nothing done or clarified just tires me.  It just isn't that interesting and the mystery isn't worth enduring the horror.
