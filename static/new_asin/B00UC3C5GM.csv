7035745,2,B00UC3C5GM,"Very disappointing.
With other sports (hockey, basketball, baseball) they show the game as it was on TV - just without the commercials.
In this case they rush through it and while you see every play, you have little sense of time remaining, field position, down - and they ""enhance"" it with silly background music for hype when I'd rather hear the crowd reaction.  On a game cast you will get a lot more replays; relatively few here.
Good idea; they could have done it a lot better.  Perhaps since multiple networks were covering the games there was some licensing problem with the straight game-cast.",1431561600,8,601,4.769230769230769
7035746,4,B00UC3C5GM,"""3 Games to Glory IV"" is a 3-Blu-ray disc (BD) set that serves as a perfect summary of the New England Patriots' highly successful playoff run at the end of the 2014 NFL season. As is well known, that playoff run ended with the Patriots winning Super Bowl XLIX on February 1, 2015.

""3 Games to Glory IV"" is a unique and absolutely outstanding production in every way.  Instead of summarizing the entire 2014 season, it focuses solely on the three games played - and won - by the New England Patriots in the 2014 postseason.  Each of the three BDs contained in this set spotlights one of the three Patriots playoff games: the Divisional Playoff game, AFC Championship game, and Super Bowl XLIX.

NFL Films once again employs its brilliantly conceived combination of regular speed and slow-motion photography, excellent music, and sounds from ""miked-up"" players and coaches. Clips of every play of each game are woven seamlessly together to form a smooth-flowing narrative of each game, with play-by-play and color commentary provided by Patriots radio announcers Bob Socci and Scott Zolak. The mellifluous voice of narrator Scott Graham also provides spare but essential narration where needed.  All non-essential ""dead time"" - the time between plays, replays, time-outs, etc., has been removed, so each full game takes less than one hour to watch.

""3 Games to Glory IV"" contains a wealth of special features that I found especially entertaining. On each BD, viewers will find postgame press conferences and interviews with Tom Brady, Bill Belichick, and other standout players, as well as Belichick's game breakdown for the game featured on the disc. Several other very entertaining short features are included as well. It's important to note that none of the controversy surrounding ""Deflate-gate"" and Tom Brady's possible role in it are addressed anywhere in ""3 Games to Glory IV,"" although ""Deflate-gate"" is mentioned once in passing. The focus of the entire set is football as it was played during the 2014 postseason.

The main programs and all special features of the Blu-ray version of ""3 Games to Glory IV""  are presented in high definition video that is crisp, clean, shows no artifacts, and has perfectly balanced color. The video has a wonderfully filmic quality to it. Each disc also employs DTS-HD Master Audio 2-channel stereo which brought a surprisingly immersive sound into my viewing area.

""3 Games to Glory IV"" is an outstanding addition to the long and illustrious series of NFL films that commemorate team championships. It's a perfect complement to the ""New England Patriots: Super Bowl XLIX Champions"" BD that was released earlier this year.  Highly recommended.",1431216000,3,2688,5.10250569476082
7035747,5,B00UC3C5GM,"The 3 Games to Glory series is one of the best retrospective film series in all of sports. The one caveat is, this set only covers the divisional playoff game, the conference championship game and the Super Bowl; this is not a retrospective of the entire season. The focus on just the three post season games allows, for a complete immersion into each game. You get every play from scrimmage, in each of the three games without all of the between snap delays. This set has a great high def picture and great sound quality; and is a must own for any Pats fan.",1430697600,17,558,4.375
7035748,3,B00UC3C5GM,"I pre-ordered this from the patriots Pro-shop, and it arrived May 2,  I was very much looking forward to it, I own the first 3 installments and was excited to add this to my collection.
Overall, I have to say I was a bit disappointed:
The picture and sound quality were fantastic, and the musical score added much to the experience like it does with other NFL films presentations.  I just feel that where detail was needed most, the presentation failed... There was hardly a mention of the 4 offensive lineman strategy employed by the Patriots in the Baltimore game.  It was discussed very briefly for one play, but the DVD failed to capture just how important that series was, and how the strategy really confused the Ravens.  It was a bit of a letdown.
Also a letdown was the lack of 'on the edge of your seat' atmosphere during the final Seahawks drive during the Superbowl.... The absolute absurdity of the catch made by Kearse, the strategy of Belichick to not use his time outs.  For what was one of the greatest Superbowls ever, it seemed to be dulled down too much.  However, thankfully disc 3 does have the original TV broadcast of the 4th quarter of the game, which does capture that excitement...

The bonus features were pretty nice, showing post game interviews/press conferences with the Patriots, some ""behind the scenes"" stuff that shows many aspects of preparing for games that most people don't even think about.  However, I would have liked to see some of the post game interviews/press conferences with the opposing teams.  I know this is a Patriots presentation, but the reactions of the other teams to what happened in the game are very relevant.

Overall, it is a must-have for the collection, and I have no regrets about purchasing it.  However, if you have no collection, it really isn't a necessity... it simply doesn't add that much to the games as they were shown on TV.",1430697600,23,1898,4.686746987951807

Two stars for the video, but five stars for the Patriots winning it all!

Im a Patriots fans via New York City since their nearly undefeated & legendary 2007 season. This is my first ever comment on Amazon. Ive been a customer since around 2007.

Was excited to get and play the Patriots win those three games. Thats good. And also they wired players like Julian Edelman for candid comments. Behind the scenes are great in special features.

But whats disappointing is the presentation of the games. Soundtrack music is fine, but when used in highlights. It has no place for a full game, esp. with some narrator voiceover, which makes it look like a war movie or documentary.

Except for the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl, every game was not Hi Def, more like standard definition, on the blu ray

Who are these announcers on the video? They sound like excitable  gee whiz kids. Since this video had questionable production values from the Patriots themselves, it looks one-sided, as if the reigning Super Bowls champions write the history, not the NFL

At present, the original (and better) broadcasts of the games are available on iTunes. Al Michaels and Cris Collinsworth are top rated and objective. NFL films should bring out a Patriots Road to Super XLIX release.  Lets wait until inflategate gets settled...",1435708800,8,1328,4.819383259911894

And the fake dramatic music gets tiresome.  It felt like their target audience was people that don't understand football rather than hard core fans.  The original TV broadcasts were better, but they aren't included on the disks.  Nor was much behind the scenes footage included.  The ""extras"" were often recycled clips from the in season weekly shows.  And they didn't seem to include anything about the deflategate controversy, which was one of the most talked about stories of the year.  Overall it looks like not much love was put into making this set.",1434844800,,690,4.691666666666666
7035799,1,B00UC3C5GM,"I was really looking forward to watching this video with my son. I was very disappointed. This looks like it was made by a bunch of interns. They rush through the games as if they are in a hurry to finish the video. The game clock is not shown, you hardly have an idea of down and distance, or even their field placement. Almost the entire video is shown in close up, so you hardly ever see the full field. You don't see the play develop at all, you can't tell if the ball traveled 5 yards in the air or 50 yards in the air. The Pats-Ravens game, which in my opinion was one of the finest games in a while, was completely butchered by these clowns. The fantastic ineligible receiver play is barely explained. Very disappointed. You will find free videos on youtube with the entire game which are FAR SUPERIOR to this drivel.

On the negative side, they compress the play too much.  Instead of presenting the complete game, without commercial interruption, it basically goes snap to snap.  Practically every play is close-up.  It's very easy to lose a sense of the game, time & downs remaining, and momentum.

I also find the play-by-play announcers to be very annoying.  For example, the play-by-play guy calls every overthrown pass ""too tall'...  The second announcer is clearly a fan boi and adds absolutely nothing to the game.  The least they could have done is let NFL films do all of the commentary or hire professional announcers.",1433548800,,874,4.728476821192053
