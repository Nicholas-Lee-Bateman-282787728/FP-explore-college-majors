8698150,4,B00SCO1104,"The Rich Girl is another fine and characteristic Vaala picture, vastly superior to the Hollywood equivalent of the period (or any other period).  A clever inversion of The Man from Sysma, in this one the setting is contemporary rather than period, and Reimas and Sari flip roles.  Here he is level heaved and emotionally mature while she is given to temper tantrums because of her felt but not understood dissatisfaction with life and the limitations imposed by her class status.
As seems typical of Vaalas work, the story is fundamentally comedic and elaborate with many twists and turns, all of which are finessed with elegance and good taste.  As seems also characteristic, he deepens the mood when necessary  there is nothing superficial about this movie.  Vilhelm Jack Vinters (Olavi Reimas) upper class parlor-snake rival, the cynical, bored and bitter Baron Ahlfeldt (Turo Kartto), is a real characterization, not the cipher he would be in a Hollywood film.  Fully rounded, he is an illustration of Alexander Mackendricks narrative density, as is the character he so viciously dismisses (the middle class fianc of one of his smart set pals).  Over in an elegant flash, the hurt she experiences when so brutally insulted is genuinely painful.  Given much more to do (to the point of virtually sharing leading lady status with Sari) Lea Joutseno (as Lea) is her usually bubbly, idiotic but at the same time down to earth and sensible self, irresistible loopy and funny.  The two leads are enchanting.  Sirkka Saris Anni Hall is major league; she is fully up to the challenges of the role (by turns giddy, silly, unbending, condemning, priggish, loving, generous, etc.).  Olavi Reimas is a very handsome fellow.  Large, well-built and with a wonderful deep and resonant voice, he combines his natural advantages with plenty of charisma and acting ability.
The production is impressive  much more expensively mounted than are some of the other Vaala pictures Ive seen.  The dresses, hats, decors, locations are all lovely.  As this is the story of the rich girl and the things she comes to learn, the production values are not for mere show (IE, Hollywood), but are pertinent to the story and the characters.
Sirkka Sari died, horribly, (at 19) during the production of this film, which necessitated some changes to finish the picture.  The ending was altered (which probably explains why, at this point the directors usual showing what is happening through how he structures the material, through what he gives us to see, and through the nuances of the acting) is replaced by straightforward dialogue exposition between Reimas and Anni Aitto (Annis mother).  This exposition provides a pat solution to the class conflict aspect of the Jack/Vilhelm (the two names are thematically meaningful) Anni Hall relationship (hes really of the same class and was only pretending as it was fun to do so) and does not ring true.  On the basis of the one deeply tender, wonderfully, magically moving scene between the two actors a bit earlier in the movie, my guess is something a lot more substantial had been planned for the ending.  The long shot resolution of their relationship is likewise due to her tragic death.  Since I don't know the specifics, I can only speculate, but perhaps Joutsenos role was beefed up for the same reason, though such rich character development is typical Vaala.  In any case, it must have been appalling for everybody involved to have to go on with the movie.
Sirkka Sari gets billing above the title, and alone, in an exquisitely gallant gesture from Vaala and Suomi Filmi.  The subtitling is excellent - colloquial and funny, and there are lots of charming extra features (not subtitled).  The juxtaposition of the last two images in the production photos section deeply, deeply upset me.  I jumped in seeing a ravishing still which captures not only her beauty but her vibrant personality followed by a shot of a nightmare chimney maw.  Even though true, it is gross, and not in keeping with the good taste and spirit of Vaalas work.
Anyway.  Buy this at once!",1425513600,,4088,4.957478005865102
