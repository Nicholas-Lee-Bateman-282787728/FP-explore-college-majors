Spoilers!!!

In this volume its immidiatly after they talk to tsunade about becoming hokage that she has to chose between that or helping orochimaru. In the end naruto's strength and determination to become hokage helps tsunade make the decision to become hokage rather than helping orochimaru and in turn destroy the leaf village. This volume has nothing but the huge fight between the Sannins, naruto, and kabuto. Naruto also learns his special attack the Rasengan which helps beat kabuto leaving the sannin to fight.
In the end orochimaru is gone again and they all head backto the leaf village with the new hokage having the season come to a close.",1214870400,,837,4.687074829931973
