Can't wait for the DVD release. The host, Brian Cox, is a physicist, and his delight and wonder regarding the topics in the show are infectious. I can't recommend this enough!",1280275200,42,331,4.724137931034483

4093082,1,B00395ATPO,"After the gravitas and utter professional presentations of David Attenborough in previous BBC Earth documentaries, the adolescent-like and goofy Brian Cox is a tremendous letdown. He's boring, he appears unprepared, he looks like he was out too late at the club, and I wonder if the BBC picked him to appeal to teenage girls. I have never turned off a BBC nature series until this one. One hour seemed like ten. Cox takes forever to make the most trite observations. Doesn't even come close to the Planet Earth series.",1435536000,,518,4.831460674157303
4093083,1,B00395ATPO,"I've seen a lot of the reviews of Brian Cox, saying he is so 'excellent'. I'm not sure what the fuss is about. For me, he's BORING!! Instead of SHOWING us what he's talking about, he TALKS about it and spends most of his time on earth, while talking about Mars or Venus. The #1 rule of showmanship is to SHOW, rather than just talk!
I found myself fast-forwarding through his videos just to TRY to find images from other planets--and that was definitely HARD!! I'd say that in the two discs, I might have seen about a minute and a half of actual footage from a planet other than earth.
Don't get me wrong--I like our planet. However, when I see him showing me images of the Grand Canyon instead of Valles Marineres on Mars, I just about fall asleep! (He did show about 5 seconds of video of Mars--then quickly shifted back to earth.)
In one segment, he was talking about the sunrises and sets on Mars. Did he show Mars? Sort of. He pulled out pictures and placed them on the ground, using rocks to keep them from blowing away. (I kid you not!)
Sorry, BBC, but you can keep Brian Cox. I'll take any of our (the U.S.'s) guys over him every time!
If I want to see videos of planet Earth, I'll watch the excellent series ""Planet Earth""!
I wasted my money on his discs. They'll immediately go into my junk pile.",1434499200,2,1306,4.291497975708502

They're fascinating, inspiring, interesting series and the landscapes are breathtaking. Professor Brian Cox is a great  narrator and presenter who can make complex subjects easy to understand. His excitement and enthusiasm in the materials he is presenting  are very contagious. While gaining  knowlege about the universe, you'll be entertainted. I highly recommend these sciense series to all.",1433289600,,566,5.635294117647059
4093085,5,B00395ATPO,I saw this series when it first came out on either the science or history channels. I loved it then and I love it now. I like how Brian Cox explains things in detail and keeps your interest all the way through.

His love for science feels contagious as he radiates with excitement and joy in each episode, which are all clearly well-thought out, planned, and well executed. The cinematography is very crisp, clean, and engaging, as is the presentation of the information in each episode.

4093099,3,B00395ATPO,"Maybe i'm being harsh to the video - but i wish it had more science.  Ie, explain how fusion works, explain how different stars work and the process they go through - show what happens to the stars of different sizes - that's cool stuff! Stars are amazing !  Instead it just lightly dabs on the surface.  It seems we live in a world where science needs to be glamorized and simplified in order to sell.  It was like, oh we get to skip to where the sun starts to destroy stuff - oh yes our sun will incinerate the earth! dude. really? Tell me about how the fusion reaction is going critical because it's running out of hydrogen: WHY that is causing the sun to increase in size.  Talk about this huge battle between gravity and the energy produced by fusion - talk about supernovas, neutrino stars (which are freaking awesome btw: 20 km diameter star composed of NEUTRONS, with possibly a strange super fluid interior - basically a gigantic atom) or blackholes, etc.  Explain how larger stars create all the elements in our universe through FUSION.  Shell fusion in larger stars is freaking awesome.  Use cool graphics. Show a sun making elements through eons and stopping at iron, then boom.  Don't just tell me, it will grow HUGE and destroy all the planets!. I want to know why.  That's at the heart of science.  It does this, it does that it blow this up is almost not worth watching at all.

Does anybody know of any videos that are actually filled with good hard science and information? Something that goes in depth, that isn't diluted and tells you how things work down to the molecular level.  Is that too hard to ask?",1409875200,,1625,4.48639455782313

But mainly, the man is so knowledgeable, and is so high on science, his enthusiasm and boyish charm pull you in and make you want to know more about whatever he wants to talk about.

4093113,5,B00395ATPO,"Well, the solar system is definitely a better place with Professor Cox in it. He is enchanting to watch and listen to. This is a fascinating series. Only one gripe, the scenes shot with the sun behind his head which produce a glare that blocks out all else. I thought every photographer knows not to do that, sun behind the camera please.",1393286400,,338,4.467741935483871

4093115,5,B00395ATPO,This is one of my favorite video series. It also makes me wonder how much longer we will last. The solar system is a dangerous place. Beautiful and frightening. I wonder how the narrator can be so calm about it.,1389139200,,211,4.3
4093116,5,B00395ATPO,An informative video by Brian Cox explaining amazing facts of the solar system that is easy-to-understand for those not knowledgeable in this science.,1386547200,,150,5.565217391304348
4093117,5,B00395ATPO,"Really enjoyed this. Brian Cox presents things with such enthusiasm. For someone with no background in science, physics or astronomy I learnt so much from this series and would recommend to anyone.",1386028800,,197,5.1875
4093118,5,B00395ATPO,"This is a rich, artistically produced and presented video series. Within a context of appropriate wonder, it makes the science of the solar system clear and accessible.

4093120,2,B00395ATPO,"I bought these for use in my science class. I was looking for exciting presentations of information on the planets. However, the producers went out of their way to create the story of evolutionary theory than to inform us about the planets themselves. I could care less about the origins and more about fantastic cinematography (Silhouettes of the speaker were not needed).",1380153600,,373,5.032258064516129
4093121,2,B00395ATPO,"Our family owns over 21 of the BBC documentaries on blu-ray, and I did not hesitate at all when purchasing both Wonders of the Solar System and Wonders of the Universe.  The BBC has achieved the status of the absolute documentary king, the new bar for amazing nature docs.  Documentaries like Planet Earth, Africa, Frozen Planet, Life, Wild China, Ganges, etc..., etc... are unmatched beautiful pieces of informative art.
However, these 2 BBC Brian Cox ""Wonders"" series are a huge disappoint, and I mean a disappointment to our entire family ranging from ages 5-40.  I was truly hoping that these 2 would fill in the needed cosmological gap of BBC nature documentaries.  Not to be.

First, when I watch a documentary about planetary or cosmological things - I expect to see space.  A LOT OF SPACE!  Planets!  Galaxies!  Light!  However, what we end up seeing in both of these documentaries are Brian Cox.  My son even asked me if the documentary was about the ""talking guy"" or if it was supposed to be about ""space"".  That's pretty telling.  We see more of Cox's ridiculous reactions than we ever see of actual cosmological phenomena.  It's like MTV made a documentary and was aiming at an audience of ADHD teenagers.  The actual information is watered down and they skim over all the important information that might actually be interesting, and the entire production seems to focus more on Brian Cox wearing different 'cool' outfits for every shot and walking around in different locales to loud music.  If you've watched space docs in the past, you will notice immediately how little they actually show space.  In fact, sometimes they show Brian Cox so much that the actual phenomena he is watching get MISSED!  For instance, he is demonstrating in one episode the explosive reaction that occurs when pure sodium is combined with water.  We hear the explosion, but we don't even see it!  The camera never leaves Cox's laughing face.  And if I have to watch this guy muss his hair on camera one more time.... oh boy.

Secondly, I am completely confused as to why they spend over 60 percent of each episode on things that do not belong in a space documentary.  If I want to learn about sea turtles, bubbles, children in India, abandoned prisons, etc... - I will watch one of the other truly great BBC documentaries about these things.  They spend so little time on the actual concepts implied on the cover, that you end up watching a second-rate documentary about a hodge-podge of things that looks like it's produced to be a music video instead of a science documentary.

Sadly, the BBC has fallen just a tiny bit in our estimation of their documentary status with these 2 stinkers.  Hopefully, the director of these 2 is not an omen of future BBC docs.  I don't think so, because I've seen some nature documentaries that were produced after these 2, and they are much better.
Overall, if you really want to watch a great space/cosmology/universe documentary - it's still hard to beat Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos"" series.  I find it completely amazing that any of the other reviewers are even comparing this doc to Cosmos in any way.  Even though it's much older and doesn't have the flashy computer graphics that this does, it's a much more informative, MUCH BETTER NARRATED true space documentary.  Sagan never looked like he was trying to act/look as ""cool as possible"".  I have a feeling it might be a long time before the Cosmos series is matched by a modern space documentary.  Save your money on these 2 and try Cosmos instead, if you haven't already.",1379894400,11,3553,4.745513866231648
4093122,5,B00395ATPO,The combination of Brian Cox's very common sense and enthusiastic approach to such incredible discoveres in our Solar System coupled with the latest CG images of what scientists now are theorizing is a wonderful match that Carl Sagan would be proud of!  I am so stoked to be able to own such a masterpiece!,1378598400,,306,4.666666666666667
4093123,5,B00395ATPO,"Brian Cox has the intellectual appeal needed to pull a show like this off and to captivate it's audience. If you'd like to learn stuff about our HUGE solar system that cannot be learned anywhere else on TV, this is the show to watch!",1377648000,,233,4.318181818181818

4093130,5,B00395ATPO,I can only reiterate what others have said.  I am well read enough to follow along with the material presented quite easily but I don't believe that is even necessary for most to truely enjoy this enlightening work.  Someone did say that the presenter was a bit too much the centerpiece at times (paraphrasing) but he does it so well that I'd think that an advantage for anyone trying to get adolescents interested in the sciences (there is more than astronomy here of course).  I could do with a bit less of him but sometimes a personality can reach beyond the material and captivate those who do not yet know how much they will come to love science in the future.  We need more of that with the sad state of education in the US.,1359936000,,730,4.385185185185185

4093133,5,B00395ATPO,"I've watched this Blu-ray discs with my 7 year old daughter, and both of us really enjoyed it. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys scientific documentaries.

The basic structure of the film is that the professor Brian Cox introduces a certain topic about the solar system (say how Mars has been geographically dead for past oh so many million years), then discuss this by contrasting that with the Earth by traveling to sites to illustrate the topic (say a volcano in Africa). For a person like me, who already has a reasonable knowledge on the subject matter, this is a somewhat roundabout way of approaching the subject. On the other hand, for someone like my daughter, the footage of the Earth really helps her relate to this otherwise abstract and hard-to-imagine stuff that's out there. Also, to be fair, those Earth scenes are quite gorgeous on their own --- after all, this is BBC we are talking about!

I also enjoyed Brian Cox as the narrator. You can see that he's genuinely excited about all that he talks about and sees, and that makes you happy. It felt real and sincere, but not over the top. His enthusiasm is contagious. It made my eyes swell up from time to time.

Now, I suppose this focus on scenes on the Earth is also a reflection of a real challenge in a film like this, namely that there just aren't that many *actual* pictures of those celestial bodies, let alone videos! And I think this is where the film is a bit weak. Of the precious few actual photographs taken by spacecrafts and rovers on Mars, the film chooses to show most of them by printing them out in papers and have Brian point to them in his fingers. I wish I could have seen them in larger resolutions up close.

The other thing that I think the film could have done better is to convey the astronomical (literally!) time and distance that we are talking about.  Let's take distance for example --- if you've taken a trans-atlantic or trans-pacific flight, you should have the gut-feeling sense of how unimaginably large the Earth is, yet its diameter is ""mere"" 8,000 miles. Sun, on the other hand, has a diameter of 800,000 miles. That's a difference between a quarter coin and the height of an adult human being. But yet the distance between Sun and Earth is more like 80,000,000 miles (aka 1AU.) That is, if you imagine the solar system on your desk, Sun & Earth 3 feet apart, then the size of the Earth is only about the thickness of a human hair! And oh, did I tell you that the nearest star is 270,000AU away? That's just bat-s*** insane!!

Yet the film, in an attempt to show more in screen, fails to do justice to this ridiculous vastness of the Universe. I'd have really loved to see the Google Earth-ish zoom-in/zoom-out actions that actually portrayed the accurate proportions and distances of the Sun and the planets. Or when they show you a fly-by CG of the great canyon of Mars, I'd have loved to see the Manhattan island posed in to help us grasp the monumental scale of that canyon. In those computer-generated scenes, the timescale is shifted substantially too, which also has the undesirable effect of making things feel smaller (for example, when you see Jupiter zooms in, you see the pattern of the Jupiter changes rapidly, yet if you actually are on a spaceship approaching Jupiter, it'll look completely stationary.) I don't think it's just me who gets endlessly fascinated by the sheer size of these stuff, right? I wish I could have seen those.

Anyway, don't let my nerd comments scare you away. I still thoroughly enjoyed this film after all. A highly recommended buy.",1356739200,6,3593,4.6046875

I dearly love Wonders of the Solar System and glad I had this one first to watch for so many reasons.  I've started out owning all his DVD's, books and instructing about the Universe and the Solar System.

The most glaring problem is that the camera is on Brian Cox way too much. I paid to learn about the solar system, not look at a physicist. A secondary problem is the excessive focus on Earth. There are 8 planets in the solar system but all of them except for earth get very short shrift. On the plus side, the picture quality is great.",1355961600,2,470,4.413793103448276

4093137,2,B00395ATPO,"I borrowed this DVD set from my local library. After over 4 hours, I'm just glad that I didn't pay a penny for it. It's just incredibly boring. Most of the imagery is taken from Earth! The presenter, one ""professor Cox"" from Britain, is just not a credible presenter; he doesn't even seem excited about the stuff he's telling us, despite the many uses of superlatives. My idol Tom Cruise would have done a much better job! The materials drift here and drift there, as there's no inherent theme over the five or six episodes. One feels the producers are just padding the program with empty stuff, like many people do with their resumes and Amazon.com reviews! I definitely don't recommend this video.",1344211200,2,699,4.691056910569106
4093138,2,B00395ATPO,"I think this is the first time I'm so disappointed with a BBC title. This is really ""The Brian Cox Show"". For a series that should be about the solar system, about 90% of the footage is shot on location around the Earth, and somebody obviously loved putting Prof. Cox on screen most of the time. For example, it is a good idea to illustrate Enceladus' ice fountains with a geyser in Iceland. But do we really need several minutes of the professor posing in front of said geyser? how about some computer graphics showing theories on how the fountains work?

For an astronomy buff like myself (e.g. I watched the pictures being downloaded from the Huygens probe the day it landed on Titan) this set offered little of value. I'm only glad I got it from the library and I fast forwarded through most of it. If I had paid for it I would have been angry!",1342569600,4,848,4.367088607594937
4093139,5,B00395ATPO,"First off, HD quality is good to great.  HD sound is also good to great.

Wonders of the Solar System (or Universe) serves as an introductory course.  The series does a great job of explaining concepts but tends not to go into great detail regarding the math/physics behind the concepts.  This is great for introducing newcomers not just to astronomy or physics, but to science and the importance of it in our understanding of life/existence, etc.

Advantages over How the Universe Works:
1) The location shots can be pretty interesting
2) Brian Cox (assuming you like his style, delivery, etc)
3) The series offers a bit more human personality then How the Universe Works
4) Avoids going into great (sometimes boring) detail into the concepts
5) Features more real life images, as opposed to CGI models (which are fantastic when done in both series)

Reasons to consider How the Universe Works:
1) HTUW goes into far greater detail
2) HTUW features numerous big names in astronomy/physics.  In addition to the narrator, these people share in explaining the concepts
3) Fantastic special effects which do justice to the events they are recreating

If you're a fan of astronomy/science, then I'd recommend picking up both series as they work well together and do not overlap much.  For example, HTUW goes into great detail regarding the Big Bang, while this is not touched on in Wonders of the Solar System (for obvious reasons). Although, now that I think of it, it might be just as well having Wonder of the Solar System and Wonders of the Universe instead of WOTSS + HTUW as I do.  But you cant go wrong with any of them.",1341705600,12,1623,4.7437722419928825
4093140,5,B00395ATPO,"I am happy with this series and the Wonders of the Universe too.  The videos link the cosmos to us like no other since the Cosmos by Carl Sagan.  Brian Cox said that the Cosmos influenced his career choice on his seeing the series as a child.  The influence is clear, at least to me, in the two series.  Like Cosmos, the Wonders series link the Universe to us in a significant and personal level.

If you think that the Universe and the Cosmos are hard sciences, separate and apart from our existence both in the distant past and the present, these videos will change your mind.

Cox is 44, but he brings a youthful zeal to these videos that exceeds the passion for science that Carl Sagan demonstrated in his series.  This helps to hold my attention and to ponder what makes him so excited that doesn't grab me the same way.

The series ponders the visible universe based on physics and goes further by hinting on how the visible universe shaped our religious and philosophical thoughts down the ages. One example of this is his comment on the need by worldwide civilizations to explain birth and death. He concludes by offering his belief on life and death based and linked on the physics of the birth and death of stars.

But he cleverly ignores that the scientific belief in the truth of the Laws of Physics as interpreted by the language of mathematics can be fallible. Who knows, maybe 100 or 200 years from now scientist may look back to the 21th century and smile at the misinterpretations of the Laws of Nature by our generation of scientists just like our scientists look back 100 years and smile that the best minds of the early 20th century believed that the Universe was unchanging, with no beginning, and consisted of only the Milky Way.  New discoveries and advances in technology and can make the best and brightest minds look silly in hindsight.

Already, physicists appear confused to me. Within my lifetime, if a scientist believed in the Big Bang theory he/she was considered a crackpot.  Now, if a scientist does not believe in the Big Bang Theory he or she is considered a crackpot.  But the crackpots who don't believe in the Big Bang are starting to make noise that cannot be ignored. The theory of Multi-verses, for example, is offered as an alternative to the Big Bang as an explanation for why the Universe is expanding at an accelerated rate. Maybe Hoyle was more right than wrong when he ridiculed the Big Bang theory.

The fact that Cox does not go into detail on any of the above theories, I believe will give his series a longer-shelf life than the Universe Series sponsored by the Science Channel.  We will have to wait 20 years or so to find out.  The Sagan Cosmos series is still being offered.  Now in DVD from the original VHS format to show how a well done series can have a very long shelf life indeed.

Finally, the DVD and Blue ray contains scenes that were cut by the History Channel since the videos go beyond 55 minutes on average and some beyond an hour--nice to own and see the full versions.",1335052800,2,3038,4.512773722627737

For all the no-somuchscience out there, let me tell you that this series are for everyone; explained with such easy fun and a surprising awe that only Brian Cox can provide, that sometimes you will forget that you are watching a physics documentary.

Every episode it's a fresh kick that compels you to get out of bed, and go live life to the fullest; watch the skies and appreciate the tiny world we live in. They are a nice mix of space CGI with footage of all around the world, capturing those living earth examples of what you'll see out there, making them absolutely not boring at all.

Look at the human body, or any other living creature, the solar system, our galaxy, the other billion known galaxies and only a fool would believe it evolution.

His overwhelmingly enthusiastic presentation style may bother some new viewers, but personally I find the unpretentious child-like excitement in his approach to the wonders of the new scientific discoveries in our universe very infectious.

I knew about half the topic going into the series. But, it was refreshing to hear the theories laid out in a coherent manner and visualized with new computing animation (can you image what an erupting volcano of ice looks like? neither did I until now). This helps a lot to correlate and solidify the matter into memory.

In addition, the host goes to some of the most fascinating places on planet earth to get glimpses of what other moons and planets look like. In hi-def, those are incredible views to take in. Think of it as a mini ""plant earth"" show ;)

There is, however, a substantial difference in the presentation style, which often made me think the program is more about Brian Cox's figure shown in different parts of the world than communicating interesting facts about the solar system. Carl Sagan did it effortlessly and it was a joy to see him, as he was elegantly bringing the surrounding context into the story, which I cannot say happened in this program.

4093161,5,B00395ATPO,"Bottom-line up front--a breathtaking series, both from a visual perspective and from a learning perspective.

First shown on BBC in mid-2010, this series is available on ""regular"" DVD and Blu-Ray.  If you've got a Blu-Ray player, spend the extra for the HD edition; it's worth it.  The presenter, Brian Cox, is the antithesis of the ""science geek"" as portrayed by people like ""The Science Guy""; however, he has real credentials (a PhD in astrophysics and works on the Large Hadron Collider).  This series blends telescope and space probe photography seamlessly with computer graphics to help you see and understand the solar system and how it works, and the amazing places that populate our neighborhood.  In addition, Cox's enthusiasm shines through the series, and he has a knack for explaining complicated items in a manner that makes them intuitively obvious.  For example, his explanation of why the planets appear to move in a retrograde motion in the sky is simple, elegant, and made the non-science types in the family say ""now I understand what you've been saying"".

Pay no attention to the couple of one-star reviews that complain that they wanted pretty pictures and instead got education.  With this series, you get both--plenty of pretty pictures, and lots of education presented beautifully.

This miniseries looks at the solar system through the eyes of our many robotic cameras sent forth as human surrogates to understand our place in the solar system, indeed in the universe.  It does tend to focus on the search for extraterrestrial life and the solar system's most likely candidates that could support life now, or have supported life in the past.  Just as our ancestors put down the church-supported belief of a heliocentric universe, scientists today are hellbent to put down the belief that Earth is the only island in the universe that harbors life.  This series does not delve into the hornet's nest of theology or philosophy, it simply puts forward the candidates for the office of extraterrestrial life.  The photography and the hi-def CG animations are beautifully done and serve to put you out there as an observer of the alien worlds beyond ours. The video looks at the variety of life forms found on Earth and focusses on Earth's life that lives in the most ""unearthly"" conditions,  than looks out into space for equally ""unearthly"" environments that match.  A major focus of today's search for ET, is looking for Goldilocks Zones around other stars, What this video shows is that nothing is written in stone, and indeed, habitable environments are possible outside of that narrow zone just in our own solar system.  What that serves to do is increase the chances life could flourish in many more places.  The elements for life are common everywhere. The building blocks of life are being found in space.

It's easy to see that he is genuinely excited and interested in conveying the knowledge of the cosmos to everyone watching at home.  The pictures from other planets were really breathtaking, such as sunsets on Mars and even the northern lights on Saturn.  The way the tell the information makes it easy to understand, too.  There are several excellent diagrams and computer-generated models, but Brian also does some very simple demonstrations with household objects that everyone can easily understand.  Also, the settings are incredible as Brian travels to India, Norway, and many other destinations to give viewers a true sense of wonder as he explores jungles, deserts, and icy waters.
Only two very small negatives (in my opinion) of this DVD: 1. They started to lose me in the ""doomsday meteor"" portion on disc 2.  It was bordering on ridiculous when the music begins to pick up and play this very percussion-heavy theme.  Luckily, they don't dwell on it and the video moves on.  2.  The cameraman/producer gets carried away with the shot ""Brian's face - Brian's face moves - direct sunlight into the camera! - Brian's face blocks sun again - Repeat.""

Those very small drawbacks are not nearly enough to drop this review even one star.  This Blu-Ray is already in my top favorites along with Planet Earth, as the scenery is breathtaking, the information is relevant and easy to understand, and I think suitable for even grade school kids wanting to learn about the solar system.  Overall and OUTSTANDING edition to my collection, and I'm already watching it for the second time!",1287100800,8,1729,4.900343642611684
4093180,5,B00395ATPO,"This is quite a series.  Totally unique.  The overview of the solar system has been done many times, but none with the unique approachable style of Prof. Brian Cox.  It is easy to get put off by the great voices and giant stature of the presenters normally used on such programs.  Bryan Cox is more a guy you know who knows more than anyone you are likely to know about his subject.  And the graphics are simply the best as are the little side trips he takes along the way. And the blu-ray can't be beat. Bravo Brian!",1286582400,4,517,4.23469387755102
4093181,5,B00395ATPO,"The recent Science Channel broadcast of the BBC series is available in this three disc set. Professor Brian Cox is the host and primary commentator. He recounts the recent discoveries by unmanned probes on other planets and moons in our Solar System. He then takes the viewer to locations on Earth to examine similar phenomena to those observed on these bodies. Interviews with specialists in these processes help clarify these similarities. The Sun, Saturn's rings, eclipses, geysers, volcanoes, glaciers, and the exitence of Life here and its possibility elsewhere are among the equivalent phenomena covered in episodes entitled Empire of the Sun, Order Out of Chaos, The Thin Blue Line, Dead or Alive, and Aliens. Professor Cox is a wonder himself, sometimes laughing with delight as he lucidly reveals and illustrates these Wonders of the Solar System.",1286409600,2,856,5.255474452554744
4093182,5,B00395ATPO,I cannot fully articulate how good this series is.  It is fabulous. The graphics are amazing and Professor Cox makes the complex seem simple.  He runs the same thread through every episode which is that the ecosystem on Earth is only part of a much larger ecosystem and that the same natural forces that created and developed our planet are operating everywhere in the solar system with such different and varied results.  My view of nature will never be the same. My horizons are so greatly expanded.,1284249600,7,501,4.735632183908046
4093183,5,B00395ATPO,"This 3-disk DVD set is definitely worth every penny.  The knowledge contained in these disks is not only fascinating, but oftentimes entertaining and awe-inspiring.  I challenge anyone to get through this series without an ""ooh"" an ""ah"" or a ""WOW"".  The footage is gorgeously shot and the special effects beautifully rendered, and though some bits repeat a few times (I believe the animation of the big bang is shown at least once in every episode), none of it really detracts.  In fact, it often gives a bit of breathing room, where you can sit and absorb the new things you've just been shown.  Both the presenter and the professionals he speaks to on the show have a lot of knowledge to offer, and I doubt there are many people who will watch this program without learning at least one thing.

Professor Brian Cox is an excellent presenter.  As many have said before me, he puts everything in language that's easy to understand, without being the least bit condescending.  He's genuinely, contagiously excited about the material he's presenting, almost always with a nearly childlike grin plastered onto his face.  On top of this, he's charismatic, and often quite funny.  This makes the program feel less like a classroom than it does a journey of discovery.

I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the third disk contains Prof. Cox's two HORIZON specials, ""What on Earth is Wrong With Gravity?"" and ""Do You Know What Time It Is?""  Though there are no other special features on the disks (No behind-the scenes or deleted footage to be found), these specials bring the amount of material on the disks to about 7 hours.  I'm definitely not complaining, as this is quite a bit of footage for the price.  (Edit: I had miscalculated, originally.  The specials were marked into 4 scenes each, and as this was not in a separate scene selection menu, I thought the specials were each 4 episodes.  However, each special is about an hour long, and the menu is for the different scenes.)

Put all of this together, and you have a series that's not only valuable in the amount of material in comparison with the price, but in the value of the material itself.",1284163200,21,2157,4.724598930481283
4093184,5,B00395ATPO,"If this double DVD doesn't turn you on to physics or the Heavens , nothing will ! This has 'evergreen' written all over it, great camera work, intelligent text without getting to technical , with the top shelf BBC quality. Filmed in various countries and locations , great special effects without losing the story line. It covers a number of fields like history,geology,climate,all beautifully interwoven. I could go on but do yourself a favor and get this DVD and I promise you won't regret it.",1283904000,4,495,4.8352941176470585
4093185,5,B00395ATPO,"I have just finished watching the UK DVD. Superb, I loved it. Prof. Brian Cox is great (winsome actually), his explanations were very good, his explanation about the conservation of angular momentum in star formation and tornadoes was superb. His explanation of the retrograde motion of Mars was also very good, it was the first time I understood it. He calculated the total energy output of the sun, using a can of water, an umbrella and a thermometer. Maybe he will encourage more people to study physics (he is a particle physicist). My degree is in Physics. so I enjoy this stuff.

As it was written in 2009, it takes into account all the probes that we have sent into the Solar System (over the last 30+ years). What was of particular interest, to me, is all the moons in the Solar System, all 145+ of them, Saturn alone has 61 moons. Titan has liquid methane lakes instead of water and it has an atmosphere, Enceladus has geyser like events. With Jupiter's 63 moons, IO has active volcanoes, and Europa is an Ice moon with some evidence of water below the surface. With Mars there is evidence of water and an atmosphere in the distant past, and there is methane on Mars now. He goes into some detail about Saturn's rings, which was fascinating, to me as a physicist. The only problem I have is it is only 5 episodes and I wanted more, the next series will be on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonders-of-the-Universe/dp/B004XKVQVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonders of the Universe</a>. It is fascinating stuff. The SFX were good too.

The series is a good example of the Anthropic principle, Cox calls it the Goldilocks principle, ""everything was just right"" to produce life (on Earth). It is the correct mass, distance from the sun, it has an atmosphere so that the Earth can support liquid water, without which there would be no life. The magnetic field deflects the solar wind so the atmosphere is not stripped off, the atmosphere helps to regulate the climate, protects us from the sun's rays and helps to protect from meteorites.

Episodes: (Adapted from Wiki.)

1. ""Empire of the Sun""
The first episode illustrates how the formation and behaviour of the Sun affects each planet in the Solar System. Includes solar wind, Aurora Borealis, plus aurora on Jupiter and Saturn.

2. ""Order Out of Chaos""
The second instalment focuses on the Rings of Saturn, and the geysers of Enceladus. Plus the formation of the solar system. Here he introduces the conservation of angular momentum, as my degree is in physics, I loved it.

3. ""The Thin Blue Line""
The third episode looks at the atmosphere of Earth and that of Saturn's moon Titan. Plus Enceladus's geyser like events.

4. ""Dead or Alive""
The fourth episode looks at the size of planets, volcanoes, and the Jovian moon Io. Plus dead Mars and hot Venus, Earth being the Goldilocks planet.

5. ""Aliens""
The final installment covers life surviving in extreme environments, and how the search for life on other worlds follows the search for water, focusing on Mars and Jupiter's moon Europa.

4093187,5,B00395ATPO,"As the title says, this is by far the best Astrophysics series, in my opinion, since Sagan's legendary Cosmos.

Professor Cox injects a measure of genuine excitement into this series that is seldom seen. He is truly marveled at all these wonders as he explains them, and it is extremely contagious. The topics feel close at hand, and it does a great job transporting you to these places that are 'just around the corner'. Not having to deal with the great distances and unknowns of the universe, but instead focusing on our solar system, the series goes into great detail about our cosmic neighborhood. You will have gained knowledge as never before by the time you're done.

I can't wait for the bluray release to experience this in the best quality possible with my family. Needless to say, i am now a fan of professor Cox' work and can't wait for his follow-up (which is already being filmed!!).

My only complaint is that 5 episodes is not nearly enough, I could have watched another 20!",1281744000,50,991,4.651428571428571

8391957,4,B00395ATPO,"This package includes the 5-part series hosted by British physicist Brian Cox, along with two shorter documentaries on gravity and time.  The approach here is unusual.  Rather than proceeding in a linear way, for instance from one planet to the next, Cox leads the viewer on a meandering trip to various locations on earth, which are used to illustrate certain scientific  principles.  For instance, the Deccan traps in India serve as an analogy for lava flows on Venus, while the Grand Canyon is used to explain much larger canyons on Mars, which were also carved by water flows.  The rings of Saturn are used to explain the rotating disc that gave rise to the solar system.  All this is interspersed with footage from the Voyager missions and various Mars landers.  While the narratives occasionally wander quite far from the subject matter, the series does underscore the idea that the same physics applies to all the planets.",1518393600,,929,4.916666666666667

8391960,5,B00395ATPO,"This series and the ""Wonders of the Universe"" set are two of my favorite shows about the universe. Professor Cox is soft spoken, but his passion and knowledge are clearly evident. The series is well-produced, and the information in each episode is well worth watching... many times! There's so much to absorb, that I could watch it over and over. The information is presented in a very easy-to-understand manner. Even more technical or mathematical or scientific information is presented so that someone with only basic knowledge of science or math can grasp the topics. At the same time, it's not ""dumbed down"" to the point of being worthless. The blu-ray version is exceptional. Sound quality is amazing on my surround sound system. Highly recommended! I wish they'd do another series (or ten) with Professor Cox!",1497916800,,815,5.044444444444444
8391961,5,B00395ATPO,"Unlike Carl Sagan, or Neil Tyson, no Christian bashing.

Professor Brian Cox does a terrific job explaining the solar system, dramatically, and with excellent visuals.

As an astronomer, I knew most of the material already but I very much enjoy his presentation and enthusiasm.

My favorite part in this series is when he says, With a thermometer, a tin of water, and an umbrella, you can measure the power output of the Sun, that's why I love physics so much"".

An enjoyable aspect of Professor Brian Cox is that he stays on subject.  No politics, and no criticizing people of faith. I have no idea about his politics or religion. These are always the best teachers.",1490313600,,667,4.7155172413793105
