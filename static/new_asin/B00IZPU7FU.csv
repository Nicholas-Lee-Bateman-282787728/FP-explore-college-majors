8646886,4,B00IZPU7FU,"I picked this movie from a trailer on another DVD from this company. It looked funny but on a serious subject.  It is a story about a girl that is bored with her life and job. She is recruited into the porn business and becomes friends with another girl in the business but with an opposite personality. There are many twists and sub plots. Please understand that this is not a porn movie. There are a few partial nudity scenes but not much. The main actress Norie Yasui is excellent and reminds me of Japanese actress Aoi Yu. Her friend played by Mayu Sakuma ( i think) and also is excellent. I don't want to say much more but it is a funny at times. It is an account of a girl that gets into porn movies and the results of her decisions.

DVD quality is excellent and audio is good. It is true 16/9 enhanced. Extras are just trailers

Please note this movie's real Japanese name is ""Love & Loathing & Lulu & Ayano""",1402876800,7,916,4.222857142857142
