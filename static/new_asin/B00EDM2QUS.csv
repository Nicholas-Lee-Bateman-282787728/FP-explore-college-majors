5904396,5,B00EDM2QUS,"This movie was shot with an extraordinarily low budget. When you consider what the final product is, and the fact that this film was internationally distributed to more countries than my fingers in my hands can count, I would say these guys did alright.

The movie is a mix genre of comedy-horror. It is very clever, and self-reflective at moments with most of the humor coming from satire. Though Stephen King is the main butt of the self-refferential jokes, at times it seems as if the characters are even poking fun of themselves, which serves for great comic relief.

I thought the script was very catchy, and it has it's own style that sets it aside from other independent horror films. The sexy scenes are tastefully done (and hilarious at times) and the movie can be genuinely suspenseful and scary for a comedy.

Big props to all the people involved in this production.",1418169600,21,877,4.718954248366013
5904397,5,B00EDM2QUS,"The movie was great on its own.
Being from the area it was filmed, seeing this movie before it was on DVD and having a discussion with Monroe after the viewing makes it even more memorable for me.  There's subtle  parts in it that unless you were from around here you may not exactly understand.
My sister who isn't from around here went and saw it and enjoyed it just as much as I did.  :-)

5904401,2,B00EDM2QUS,"Shame about this movie... it could have been quite good, but it isn't.

For a low budget movie, ""You Can't Kill Stephen King"" does have reasonable production values, along with what could best be described as a good 'idea' for a movie.
But unfortunately, that good idea is used up in the first few minutes of this movie, and nothing worthwhile follows. It quickly becomes obvious that the movie isn't going to maintain the spoof level it started with, and neither is it going to progress onto being a reasonable horror movie.
Apart from the characters believing that ""Stephen King lives somewhere around here"", it certainly never delivers any easily identifiable homages to the author, his books, or his movies. And don't be fooled into thinking you are going to see more of the King-related images depicted on the DVD cover artwork !
And dare I say ?... even the three attractive lead actresses couldn't stop me from quickly becoming bored with this movie !!",1415491200,8,959,4.8121212121212125
5904402,5,B00EDM2QUS,"First off, the picture quality is really good with the pixel count averaging around 8.5 Mb/sec.
This is very good for a DVD, and when upscaled it gives you a great picture, and with the scenery of the lake and woods, it can be very pretty at times.
You can choose between a stereo or 5.1 channel soundtrack.
The soundtrack  is good, with very good music and bass.

The characters are well acted, and the three girls are very easy on the eyes, especially in their bikinis.
There are some genuinely startling and gruesome scares, along with a  healthy dose of comedic content (I actually had some good belly-laughs) interspersed throughout.
As a Stephen King fan it would have been awesome if he'd made an appearance. There were many references to his novels in the movie.

The plot isn't the best in the world, but there is genuine suspense, and it keeps you guessing ""whodunit"" right up to the end.
This movie does what it's supposed to do and is what I expected it to be, which earns it 5 stars in my opinion.",1400803200,30,1010,4.4728260869565215
5904403,2,B00EDM2QUS,"Six young cleavage infested adults travel to Maine to have some fun and to meet Stephen King. While they are there they meet people who are similar to characters in the King novels. As the kids are killed off one by one, the film becomes a whodunnit that doesn't live up to its potential.

I kept waiting for the film to get good as it started out with great potential. It wavered between a slasher film and a spoof, never finding its groove. The dialogue never made it. The whole boating scene was a waste.

Works as a rental.

5904425,1,B00EDM2QUS,"We Mainers are protective of Stephen King mostly because the man just does so much here. From helping veterans,  to food pantries, winter heating, libraries and much more much of it anonymously. So when someone decides to shamelessly try and capitalize on Kings good name they better at least be entertaining.
No such luck here. This movie is profoundly dull, the humor sour, and the acting, writing and directing worse than some high school drama clubs. The only two actors with any screen presence, Blogna and the African American gentleman are killed off first!!! Leaving us with people with the dramatic chops of department store mannequins.
I was shocked to learn the brains behind this adolescent mess,Monroe Mann,is leaning on 40 so if this is where he is creatively at that age he should probably rethink show business and get a nice safe gig at the post office. You just don't have it pal. I saw way, way better from college freshmen.

Unfortunately, the gags aren't funny and it decided to become a real slasher film around 20% of the way into the movie.

The one ""gag"" that the movie is wrapped around isn't tremendously interesting and the final scene where it is explained seems overwrought.

5904453,2,B00EDM2QUS,"Dismal low budget horror comedy about some friends who drive to a small town where Stephen King may or may not live.  One of them inherited a cabin from his grandfather and the friends are going to spend the weekend in the proverbial cabin in the woods.  It's a classic slasher movie set-up and in classic slasher movie fashion one by one they are killed off in gruesome ways that are never funny--which is strange considering that You Can't Kill Stephen King is supposed to be a comedy.

The movie opens with false promise--first each of the leads is introduced with accompanying on-screen text that explains which stock horror movie archetype they personify--an idea blatantly ripped off from Feed (2005) but amusing just the same.  Then the movie gets a few laughs introducing the town and some its ominous residents--so far so good.  Unfortunately once the characters are tucked away inside the cabin and the slasher movie parody is supposed to begin in earnest You Can't Kill Stephen King turns into a comic black hole.  There might be two or three laughs in the last hour of the movie but You Can't Kill Stephen King exists for no reason other than being funny--there is no attempt to generate suspense leading up to the murders and the characters are all played so broadly it's impossible to see them as anything but something else that isn't funny.

A possible bright spot is that Stephen King fans might get a kick out of references to his work that are apparently spread throughout the movie--the only ones I recognized were the clown from It appearing in a nightmare and a couple of obvious references to The Shining but presumably his more devoted fans will spot more and feel proud for having done so like some people watch Quentin Tarantino films to spot the references and shout-outs to other movies which no doubt makes them feel very clever.

You Can't Kill Stephen King is ultimately kind of depressing to sit through because it's so lazy and unfunny--if you decide to watch this movie don't be surprised if you end up feeling like you just wasted 82 minutes of your life--minutes that could have been spent doing more entertaining things like your taxes or paying bills.",1419206400,3,2189,4.742105263157895

8604210,1,B00EDM2QUS,"I'm a Stephen King fan who doesn't need big budget or great effects to find a movie entertaining. With B movie releases I always check out what real people thought before I buy and this movie had a decent percent of good reviews, so between that and the cover art (which shows references to Children of the Corn, Cujo, Christine, ect) I bought this movie. What a total waste of time!! The acting was BAD, with the exception of the ""Black Hole of Fun"" character, and the plot was probably written in crayon on the back of a bar napkin that was covered in drool from the moron who threw up the idea for this POS. Of all the references to Stephen King on the cover art, the only one that was actually in the movie was IT, who appeared in a nightmare and featured a pair of oiled up butt cheeks clapping together at the end of the 30 seconds that he was in the movie. The rest of the plot was rambling and confused with vague verbal references to a couple short stories by Stephen King, and they got the details about the stories wrong to boot! This wouldn't have been good even if the film makers were to take Stephen Kings name out of it and advertise the movie as being a B rated horror comedy because it wasn't even funny. If they had made it a slasher it wouldn't have been good because the killings don't make sense (in one scene a guy gets his hands super glued to a steering wheel and they slit his throat from behind his seat but when they find his body it's dismembered and they ID him by his arm that shows his hand in tact, WHY BOTHER WITH SUPER GLUE AND HOW DID THEY PRY HIS HAND OFF THE STEERING WHEEL???). All these other reviews that are written to make it sound like if you don't appreciate this movie you must not have a sense of humor or like B movies were probably written by paid trolls just to sell copies. Hopefully after reading this rant you will decide not to buy this steaming pile, and if you must punish yourself by watching it because of it's name including Stephen King, you stream it and then write your own rant to keep others from making the same mistake!!",1520121600,,2086,4.230576441102757
