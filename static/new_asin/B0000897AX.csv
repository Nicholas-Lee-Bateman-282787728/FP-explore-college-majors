1831294,5,B0000897AX,This DVD delivered everything it promised. Great videography and narration. Excellent footage of a wide-range of uses for helicopters. Highly recommended to all helicopter fanatics!,1208563200,,181,6.28
1831295,5,B0000897AX,"This is an excellent video that I would recommend to anyone interested in helicopters.  The videography is amazing, and while the narration is written to be understood by children, it is interesting for adults too (unless maybe they are heli-pilots who already know everything).  I particularly liked the segments on the high-power line inspections and the rhino relocation.

My wife is enamoured with the idea of helicopters, and I was happy to encourage her fascination.  Hopefully I'll be able to get a license some day.

1831300,4,B0000897AX,"This DVD is a great sampling if you're interested in helicopters and/or the type of career opportunities they offer.  There's a great sequence servicing high-power lines, some logging action from the Pacific Northwest, and a basic flying lesson!  This was originally an IMAX film, so the quality is very good.  No, it's not screaming helicopter action, because it shows you the real world of what helicopters are mostly used for.  I also recommend checking out the bonus features, there's even better stuff in there.",1111449600,34,516,5.107142857142857

1831326,3,B0000897AX,not quite what my husband was looking for. He was not amazed by the film but still watched it. Not interesting,1392249600,,110,4.285714285714286
1831327,5,B0000897AX,This is fun for adults and children. The power lineman segment is amazing!  I would love to see another DVD like this one. We have watched it over and over,1376956800,,155,4.166666666666667

1831329,4,B0000897AX,purchased for my 4 year old son who is obsessed with helicopters. He loves it! good for kids and adults,1372896000,,103,4.2
1831330,5,B0000897AX,"I  have a ""chopper"" loving adult son, he and his 2 year old sat down and were both totally absorbed by this, it was designed for IMAX theatres so I knew it would be good, wanted to see it myself but had to rush to ship it. The reviews by my son and little grandson were it was the best and most realistic representation of being in and around helicopters that they ever saw",1364601600,,373,4.04054054054054
1831340,5,B0000897AX,My 2yo is a Helicopter fanatic and this is finally a video that is educational for both of us.  A few sections not really appropriate (starving children in Africa etc) for very young children but over all great video.,1357084800,,217,4.564102564102564
1831341,5,B0000897AX,"This movie was above my expectations.  It is an IMAX movie so right off the bat it is crystal clear scenery. It has a wonderful story, nice narration, and my 4 year old and husband loved it both.  For the record I did too!  I would recommend it to anyone into helicopters, or just looking for a educational movie.",1356566400,,313,4.271186440677966

1831343,2,B0000897AX,"An Imax fluff piece with very little sense of content. Little dialog or explanation of anything. The ""making of"" was more interesting than the show but it too had little content. Worth about a 1/3 of its price. Even with the big Imax screen there would not be much there, there, if you know what I mean.",1316908800,,303,4.333333333333333
1831344,5,B0000897AX,"I bought this for my two year old.  He is three now.  He has watched this repeatedly during the past year.  It is his ""go to"" video.  And the great thing about it is that my husband, older children, and myself enjoyed watching it the first several times too!!!  This definitely not a kids video in that it was created for adults,  but kids seem to love it.  I have bought it for gifts for little boys knowing that parents will thank me.",1312675200,,436,4.180722891566265
1831345,5,B0000897AX,"This DVD launched my three year old's interest in helicopters.  He watches it over and over -- especially the last segment on the Coast Guard rescue helicopter.  He says when he gets big he will fly a helicopter and he frequently plays with his little people jumping out of helicopters and planes to rescue people.  Even better though, this is also interesting to the adults in the room.  Even after so many viewings, I still enjoy watching it.",1296950400,,444,4.653846153846154
1831346,5,B0000897AX,"I've loved helicopters for as long as I can remember.  I've worked two summers in Alaska at the premier Helicopter Tour Guide company in the southeast, and spent a lot of time around them (mostly A-stars, B2's, some conversions, also a 214 and few 500's).  This documentary makes me miss them all.  The information is accurate, pertinent, interesting and engaging.  The aircraft featured are from a wide variety of manufacturers, regions and purposes.  The narration isn't spectacular, but I don't watch it because of the writing.  I watch it because of the filming.  The locations, style and subject all vary for each portion.

I recommend this film to any parent with kids like me, and any helicopter enthusiast, whether your burgeoning or full-blown.",1291075200,3,753,5.065040650406504
1831347,4,B0000897AX,"I bought this witht he hopes that it would hold my 2-year-old son's attention for more than 5 minutes. So, I put it on thought I get get a few small chores done.... boy was I wrong. I sat there for half an hour before I could  shake myself free. The shots are spectacular and will hold even the youngest of aircraft enthusiast's attention. The DVD is full of insightful information for adults as well. The opening sequence is a bit ""corny"". Overall, a very cool DVD for everyone.",1280620800,,479,4.382022471910112
1831348,3,B0000897AX,a pretty good video but a little short for my liking. It was about forty minutes if I remember correctly. It features about twelve or thirteen different helopters and some of the different jobs they can do. There are some pretty neat action shots but not the best aviation video I have seen. There are also some good bonus features that explain more about some of the jobs featured in the video.,1250467200,,395,4.5
1831349,4,B0000897AX,I bought it as a gift for a 3 year old boy who is obsessed with helicopters.  His mom told me he realy enjoys it and it is a good DVD.,1239235200,,134,3.3225806451612905
