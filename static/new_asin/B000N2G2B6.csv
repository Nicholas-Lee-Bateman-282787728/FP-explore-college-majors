8174001,5,B000N2G2B6,"This is a great program for the whole family to learn Arabic. The set comes with the complete series in DVD format, a CD-ROM game, audio CD with all the songs, flashcards, and study booklets.

The program itself is fun to watch. It's similar to the Sesame Street format, with short skits, lessons, catchy songs, and a complete storyline following the adventures of Sinbad and his friends. You can find short clips on YouTube to get a preview. My kids and I really enjoy the songs and it makes learning new words easy and fun.",1454284800,,525,4.526315789473684
8174002,5,B000N2G2B6,"This is the best Arabic learning set in the market for kids and even older learners. I'm a language material designer so I know a good product when I see it:) My 3 year old enjoys it. I bought it so she can learn standard Arabic (we speak an Arabic dialect at home) and sure enough she started saying ""eindi kanz - I have a treasure"" :) after watching one clip.

The cartoons, audio, selection of topics and the whole production are professionally done. There is one main story about Sindibad and the thieves who want him to help them find the treasure. The story is interrupted by short clips that illustrate the meaning of focus words/phrases, such as ""I want, this is.."", and other clips that present lists of thematically-organized vocabulary, such as a list of fruits, body parts, etc. Those intervening clips are actually my favorite part of the set. The story can be a little difficult to follow sometimes and learner will probably have to watch it several time. However, everything is accompanied by Arabic or English subtitles. The songs included are also very cute and help in memorizing the lists of vocabulary.

I love that a lot of the vocabulary included and the sketches are for daily life items and situation. It is hard to find such a selection in textbooks. One place for development is by adding situations and activities to practice and recycle the huge number of vocab in the set. The vocabulary builder CD has all the vocabulary introduced in the set but no activities. I do not have the game CD so I do not know if it includes such activities.

If you are in the US, make sure to email the company and ask them to send you the NTSC copy. Their default one is PAL which works fine on computers but does not work on all DVD players in the US. This happened to me but the company's customer support was great and they sent me an NTSC copy that worked great without any extra fees!

In sum, this is a great set for learning Arabic. The company has 3-4 sales a year when they discount their products so you can look for these. I'm going to buy at least one set for my AFL students (studying Arabic as a foreign language). They are university age but they enjoyed the little Sinbad videos on Youtube A LOT when I played them in the class.

Thank you Sinbad company for creating such a great product and wish you the best in making it better and better.",1348185600,2,2369,4.436781609195402
8174003,5,B000N2G2B6,"I bought this from ArabianSinbad.com and not from Amazon. However, looking at the description and the photos at Amazon, it is the same item as that on the ArabianSinbad.com site.

Arabic is not my native language, but I have been learning Arabic for more than ten years, most recently pursuing an MA in the language. I had also started talking to my daughter in Arabic, and reading her some Arabic books, but she was not getting as much immersed in the language primarily because it is the third language in the house. An Egyptian friend referred me to Arabian Sinbad as I was discussing how to immerse her into the language. On his recommendation I bought this set.

I was quite surprised both at the quality of the cartoon and the content, it exceeded my expectations. The clip that is provided on Amazon perhaps does not do justice to the movie which is full of songs, conversations, funny clips revolving around a story where Sinbad, and his sister go through a number of adventures. The series employs the language immersion skills well in that there is reasonable repetition of the concepts and vocabulary with different angles, and a lot of repetition of common vocabulary words, such as colors, numbers. This helps achieve the goal of those vocabulary items getting ingrained in one's mind. The setting is the modern Arabic setting, in which the characters behave and act as people do in Arab world, which is quite helpful from a language learning point of view.

There is a CD with the games, which turned out to be very good for my daughter too. She just loves them because she gets to select some scenes, color them, put some artifacts (such as animals, humans, etc.) During this process, she gets to hear and identify the vocabulary items which gives her enhanced exposure. These days, she is emphatic about learning numbers in Arabic because without knowing those numbers, in one game, Sinbad falls from rocks into water and she doesn't want him to fall.

I found the other things that came along, such as the flashcards and the songs CD, interesting that I could use later, but we never got around to it and it didn't provide us with as much value because we have to spend more time with English and Urdu which are her primary languages.

There are some peeves I have about it too. The caricatures of horse and donkey are confusing enough for her that she can't recognize which is which in isolation. Similarly, many other animals and fruits are unrecognizable for kids simply because they are caricatures and sometimes beyond recognition. I have to overcome this challenge by having to use the vocabulary for those items in home, which takes away my time from her from other languages. There was one banner, which I didn't find as much useful. It would have been better if the poster were about human body, or solar system, or something else that kids find interesting.

I still give it five stars because it is definitely worth the money. I have had it for about a year and we still have a lot of material to cover. The way the series builds up and introduces concepts, and the way the everyday conversations are presented expedite language learning. I think the curve is pretty fast for small kids, so we have to go to the next episode a bit slowly. For instance, we watched episodes 5-6 some 20 times before we moved to 7 as she was still grasping new stuff and enjoying it every time we watched it. For older kids (> 5 or 6 yrs) and adults, the progress should be quicker. Most importantly, there is an option to enable/disable subtitles in Arabic which is helpful if a word's pronunciation is not clear.

In short, I am so satisfied with this purchase that I am also going to recommend this as a great learning tool for students to the director at the University. There are definitely some concepts about everyday Arabic that I learnt from this, and didn't grasp elsewhere. As they say, the more time you spend in a language and a culture, the more you learn.

The biggest caveat for anyone buying this is that it will teach you Modern Standard Arabic and not the regional Arabic of various countries. After using this, do not expect to converse fluently in the streets of an Arab country, for that, you will have to invest into Rosetta Stone or Pimsleur or, better yet, take some classes with an instructor. I have myself bought Pimsleur Arabic CDs in the past, but I gave those up quickly (my experience with Turkish was quite better). Our goal is to learn Modern Standard Arabic because it is language of the print media as well as scholarship in the Arab world, and sets the basis for learning Classical and Medieval Arabic.",1347062400,3,4648,4.632281553398058
8174004,5,B000N2G2B6,"I searched for Arabic learning products for my daughter for a while and this is the best i found in the market. This is a comprehensive package that includes 10 DVDs, activity books and illustrated dictionary, flashcards, games and songs. My daughter loved the cartoons and interacted with the characters very well. She learned the songs very quickly. She's only 2 and half year old so her interaction with the books was less than the videos but she still loved the flashcards and the songs.
 I like Arabian Sinbad simple style. Kids learn really quickly simple words and phrases while watching the cartoons. I really think Arabian Sinbad is a smart way to teach kids Arabic. You can check some sample videos on their website.

I think this product is a must-have for those who want to learn or teach their children Arabic language.",1313539200,,832,4.770833333333333
8174005,5,B000N2G2B6,"Salam, This is sooo worth it. I bought it directly from the company (cheapest option) and was surprised it reached so fast. My kids love it, and I am also learning as well. Immediate use into everyday life.",1311984000,2,206,4.447368421052632
8174006,5,B000N2G2B6,"I really, really, LOVE this set! There are so many Arabic products out to teach Arabic to adults or children, but they are usually lacking in: organization, clear pictures/vocals, or they teach stuff that most people don't even use to SPEAK to other people or communicate with normally or too old. The stuff for kids, that are good, are even less. Every couple of years, the materials for kids gets better and better and this program is the best I have seen so far! My son, who is very picky, loves these DVD's! They introduce the language in a way that is fun and piques your child's curiosity. Within the first 5 minutes, my son (and I!) was learning about ""boy"", ""girl"", the names for the members of our family, it was great!

I am not a native speaker and am learning Arabic for religious reasons, to teach my son and I just plain love the language and these DVD's, flashcards, etc. are just a good for me as they are my son! I think that for adults who are learning Arabic, it is a useful tool for them, too. The cute little songs they sing, make the vocabulary, stick in your head; even if you didn't know or want to know Arabic, you will learn something, wanting to or not!

I can't recommend this program enough! Of course, your child will not learn Arabic totally from these DVD's; but these are an excellent start for your young ones or yourself! You will be amazed and what they will learn from this program. If you are dedicated, consistent, work hard and make the language fun for them, you can create a bilingual child, no matter what language.",1277596800,,1558,4.425087108013937

8174008,5,B000N2G2B6,Our son really enjoys watching the videos.  He's picking up the language very quickly and we're pleased with the quality of the videos as well as the other learning materials.  It's also a great value.,1254873600,,201,4.714285714285714
8174009,5,B000N2G2B6,"We recently purchased this set for my 3 yr old so that he can learn Arabic like his father and it is seriously the BEST purchase we have made.
It is total immersion learning, but at the age my son is at, that's exactly what he needs. The great thing about this set is that he can watch the DVD's and be ""immersed"" in the language, and then when we actually start teaching (and using the included workbooks, CD-ROM, etc), he will already have a head start with pronunciation and the basic words b/c he's already been exposed to them!
I hesitated, at first, because of the price, but in the end it was SO worth it! My husband is overjoyed with the product as well! As Arabic is his native language, he was extremely pleased with how well put together this set is!
My son asks every morning to watch Sinbad, so it's a winner with him too!!",1228521600,2,836,4.264150943396227
8174010,5,B000N2G2B6,"I hesitated to buy this because of the price. It is so expensive, and I didn't know if my 5 and 3 year old would even like it. The distributor's website has some video clips...which my kids loved, so I went ahead and took the plunge.. .although I bought only the DVDs, not the full treasure chest.  We've had them about three weeks now, and my kids still beg to watch ""Sindebad"" (the Arabic way of pronouncing Sinbad).  I've been trying to teach myself and my kids Arabic for five years now--and this is the best item I've found yet. The quality of the animation, songs, and plot in the DVDs is excellent.  It truly is Arabic immersion--so it might be a good idea to have a basic Arabic book to go along with it.  I think it would work best in conjunction with a formal class--but this is still quite good. The DVDs all have English subtitles, which are great for me.  As my kids don't read yet, they're more in immersion mode--but are still picking stuff up.  I hope the company releases more Arabian Sinbad DVDs and items!",1222819200,5,1024,4.363157894736842
