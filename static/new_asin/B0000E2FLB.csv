1933301,5,B0000E2FLB,"well, anyone who is a fan of the d will love this dvd, and anyone who isn't already a fan will be after watching this dvd. how can 2 men rock so hard?
the live performance will rock your f***ing socks off!
and just in case you were not cool enough the first time around you get to see the hbo episodes, classics in my opinion, you get a second chance at coolness.
this is a must own for anyone ready to rock!",1068163200,2,408,3.927710843373494
1933302,4,B0000E2FLB,"Tenacious D are undoubtedly one of the MOST offensive bands ever.  I only say this after having watched the DVD, and the short films.  I have to say, I gagged more than once. ;)  But this DVD is worth it for those who truly love Tenacious D and can stomach them at their lowest humor.  Seeing the HBO show was fabulous as I'd never seen it previously.  This is a definate must for psycho fans such as myself.",1068076800,,408,4.17948717948718
1933303,5,B0000E2FLB,"For the Fans the D have served up an amazing concert experience. For peeps such as myself who never had the honor to witness the amazing-ness of Jack and Kyle, live on stage. It has the episodes of the HBO show, which again, I never got to see. This is the ultimate D experience.
For the psycho fans the D have squeezed out an amazing collection of all their tv appearances, videos, and live performances. If that wasn't enough you get behind the scene footage, and a documentary of the D on tour.
The D have stayed true to their fans and provided the ultimate companion to there debut/only acclaimed album. You'll be amazed, grossed out, and laughing your rear off at there off/on screen antics. Thanks to the D for this great gift.",1067990400,4,733,4.477611940298507

1933307,5,B0000E2FLB,"If you slept on these HBO shows way back , you must pick this DVD up.  This is where it all stems from ...Jack and Kyles' antic's are in full form , they will rock your socks off !!!!  Not sure if it shows the ""Butt Baby Birth"" as seen at some of the live shows OMG !!!  Roll a few carrots and laugh your ass off !!!  Buy this now !!!",1067904000,,334,3.5972222222222223
1933308,5,B0000E2FLB,"As far as I'm concerned, the lavish invention of Tenacious D that sprung from the fiendishly clever minds of Jack Black and Kyle Gass opened the golden-tinged JRR Tolkien-style doors to a new musical genre- the art of true musical comedy- as they peeked their rotund heads from behind their lair's cozy confines, hung some plastic devil horns around the structure's phallic-shaped door knocker and promptly sealed their compound to all others who dare to take up the band's challenge of crumbling these very sacred walls with their own style of beezlebub-sanctioned music.
  Sure, Monty Python wrote some tunes that were catchy as well as kitschy (""I Like Chinese"" being my favorite) and Spinal Tap sarcastically rocked out with thier anarchy signs jutted firmly into the smokey pyrotechnic air, but one could always detect the faint taste of coldness and disdain the actors had for their subjects.  Tenacious D (named after a random phrase Marv Albert screamed out in response to an excellent defensive basketball manuever) deeply understand how bands like Dio have tried to unmetal a nation of devil rock neophytes with their embarrasingly earnest  medieval exploits, yet the D also get entangled in the fantasy along with the inherent hilarity.  Jack Black wants to launch himself out of a catapult alongside Ronnie James Dio just as much as he would like to slay him through the gullet, Ladyhawke-style.
  And so the 6 fifteen-minute episodes of the D's adventures have finally been etched into the digital realm for all eternity.  Each follows the self-proclaimed ""Greatest Band on Earth""  from an open-mic night performance that elicits sarcastic clapping from the six or seven bar attendees, to an amazing conclusion that either teaches us a valuable life lesson in full-on ""Full House"" fashion or that a Sasquatch is a really crappy band addition.  The acoustic performances are incredible and deliciously clever, all the while sounding even more rebellious than the expensive and excellently produced studio album.  Just how cheap were these shows to make?  To put it in laymen's terms, the shows cost roughly as much as the three pounds of caviar the producers of Adam Sandler's movies are contractably obligated to cram up his ass before each of his ""Steel-mohawk-to-the-scrotomtastic"" comedic performances, with the D's shorts being approximately 816 times more satisfying.  Jack Black and Kyle Gass blend their real-life friendship into the mix so well with their respectively domineering and lighthearted characters that it's almost impossible to tell where reality and entertainment diverge (except for the above-mentioned Sasquatch encounter...maybe).  Think of the show as a ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" for the Slayer set and you're an eighteenth of the way there.  Between episodes, madcap sketches updating the Abbott and Costello comedic style only sweeten this overflowing jar of honey.  Tenacious D's videos are equally amusing, from the rootin-tootin ""Devil Went Down to Georgia""-inspired ""Tribute"" (is that Dave Grohl as the devil I see?)  to the internet-only ""F--k Her Gently"", which answers the question ""I wonder if Rage and Cage like watching Ren & Stimpy on acid?""
  Not having seen the DVD live performances yet, I can only assume they are as entertaining as the three live shows I have seen with my own peepers, each one upping the last in sass-mouthedness and general tomfoolery.  It's been a blast watching ""#1 D fan"" Lee go from blushing band roadie to the rock-star, groupie devouring attitude of the album tour.  Between songs, JB and KG always engage the crowd with tidbits of D mythology along with genuinely heart-felt fan appreciation.  Pre-taped sketches are played in between the live action, and believe me when I say they are worth their weight in pirate's booty for their glimpses into raw, adults-only ""D on D"" action.  Expect them to use the DVD medium to its full impact for these segments and the plentiful bonus materials.
  All of this serves as a warm-up for the true Tenacious D event occuring late next year, the full length feature film from everybody's favorite passive-aggressive hetero life partners.  Called ""Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny"" and directed by Liam Lynch of cult favorite ""Sifl and Olly"" fame, the movie will chronicle the D from childhood on, finally giving fans the real scoop on how this Band of Bands became the greatest one of them all.  Rumored guest stars include Meat Loaf and Rob Zombie, with these names surely being the mere tip of the metal sword.  So prepare for the upcoming metal apocolypse by stocking up on this delightful dish of D on DVD, and finally determine what kind of fan you truly are: is Tenacious D incredibly hilarious with decent music ability, or are they incredible musicians with a knack for comedy?  The corret answer is: yes!",1067126400,39,4833,5.082278481012659
1933309,5,B0000E2FLB,Let me start off by saying I haven't seen this DVD per se.  But I have seen all the episodes and the D in concert.  I guarantee that it's worth every penny in comedic gold.  I mean just the episodes with Squatch or Lee are worth it right there.  All hail the D.,1066089600,10,261,3.8679245283018866
1933310,4,B0000E2FLB,"Jack Black recently released School of Rock, a film where he releases the inner rockers from the well to do children in a posh, private school.  Tenacious D is Jack's rock child let loose upon America.
Set in the open mike clubs of L.A. Jack and Kyle suffer misadventure after misadventure looking for ""insparado"" (the secret behind great song writing) and their next gig.
Like Spinal Tap, these guys are talented but have no idea how insipid and dumb their material is.  They perform with great energy and that raises them far above the songs they are singing.  In one episode Jack and Kyle are trying to write a new song and the melody is farmiliar.  As they stop to congratulate themselves on a job well done an ice cream truck goes by their apartment and they realize they've just put words to the ice cream song.  (And made it NC-17 in the process.  Something Good Humor may have an issue with)
Inventive, fresh and stupid in a good way, Tenacious D, the satan loving, clog dancing, spine piercing folk rockers, belongs on the shelf next to Molly Hatchet, Lynyrd Skynrd, and Iron Maiden.",1066089600,11,1092,4.603092783505154

1933359,1,B0000E2FLB,"I don't typically offer any type of ""warning"" kinds of reviews, yet I was compelled out of a simple responsibility to anyone other than mindless adults with no-children households. Jack Black and Tenacious D are funny. Silly funny. Boogers and snot kinda funny. I have to say this... this is a 2 DVD set, with a 2nd DVD that has a warning: Psycho Fans Only. I'd amend that to put a standard warning to anyone that is considering purchasing this DVD that has children of ANY age in the house: The second DVD is simple debauchery. Vile is actually a better word. Jack Black has done so many things that are funny and creative, but this DVD in a house with kids is POISON. The second DVD would have an X-rating if rating systems even existed any longer. Having watched a bit of the second DVD, it was promptly destroyed, lest anyone every view it again. Poor form and nothing more than shock for the sake of saying someone actually had enough damaged brain cells to film it. Be warned, and I don't normally warn folks about much. This ""Complete Master Works"" has a booby-trap in the 2nd DVD that's included. I know of no parent that would ever knowingly risk having such a thing in the house that could be viewed by a curious child. I'm not suggesting sharing this trash with a child; just having it around is a very bad idea. Did I already use the word VILE? Oh, I did. It is nothing short of VILE. Poor form, Jack Black, very poor form.",1420588800,,1435,4.378277153558052

Both KG and JB are very accomplished musicians and entertainers. So why the overly extreme GROSS factor????  I LIKE their music (I was really surprised) and think they have great stage presence. I am completely mystified. Amazon would not publish my review that clearly identified these GROSS elements of their humor (bodily functions of all sorts, for starters). But, these guys are really good and don't have to go there. Their musical  and theatrical talents are fully sufficient. These GROSS OUT tactics really get in the way of their performances. WHAT A SHAME!!  And they can be very funny without the SOPHOMORIC TRASH that appeals to morons. I DON'T GET IT!!  WHAT A TRAGEDY!! Why make something so good so bad??
It was difficult to give this dvd 3 stars. But I gave it three stars based on their ability (they are that good), minus the GARBAGE. Remove the over the top gross out stuff and I would gladly give 5 stars. Because of the gross out stuff, I would never get any of their work again.",1354406400,,1153,4.637254901960785

Along with a full D concert and music videos and studio documentary along with a few dozen other things.  This is a pretty complete chronicling of The D in all it's head-banging glory.  Excellent.  Now, for the possible downside.  If you have never seen or heard of The D (Jack Black and Kyle Gass' musical comedy team/band) or you have a closed-mind when it comes to your comedy, then there are things on this DVD compilation that my severely disturb you. Several short films (JB's BJ, for one) appear here that are so dark and twisted, the average viewer might run away from them screaming.  Pretty harsh stuff.  If you have seen The D and like them or at least know what they're capable of, then you might just be surpised.  Maybe.  Overall, this is as complete a collection of Tenacious D as you are going to get and it's awesome.

Jack Black and Kyle Gass are amazing in this collection of live concerts, videos and sketch comedy.

1933604,5,B0000E2FLB,"Its a shame these guys aren't the BIGGEST stars in the cosmos! I guess its understandable when you consider how wild and explicit their act (art?!) is... And i hope they never get tamed or sanitised for the sake of commercial viability. For those of you living on another planet, Tenacious D can best be described as Beavis & Butthead all grown up with a doctorate in philosophy and music! They ARE the greatest band in the world (no, really!) and also the FUNNIEST! What sets them apart - from the likes of Wayne's World and Weird Al Yankovic for example - is that these guys are so damn SMART! There's substance behind their crass demeanour and crude jokes(kudos to Bob Odenkirk and Liam Lynch!) Kyle is arguably this generation's finest acoustic guitar player! The chemistry and interplay between the duo has rarely been seen since the likes of hope and crosby or martin and lewis. There is a natural affinity and admiration between the two comic geniuses - watch carefully. The HBO episodes are basically skits woven around their original compositions - mini music video movies, if you will. Their stints on MAD TV and CONAN O'BRIEN are without question the best live performances i've ever seen, with the notable exception of PRINCE. And check out the concert audience as they croon dreamily along to ""FHG"", as if it really was a tender love ballad:

""I'm gonna f**k you SOFTLY,

I'm gonna scr*w you GENTLY,

I'm gonna hump you SWEETLY,

I'm gonna b*ll you DISCREETLY...""

1933605,5,B0000E2FLB,"I don't remember how many years ago it was but very late one night I was watching MTV or MTV2 and the Tenacious D music video ""Wonderboy"" came on.  I had no idea who they were but I thought the video was fantastic, visually & vocally.  I never saw or heard about the song or video again.  Back then, my attempts to search the internet for the music video came up w/the Michael Douglas movie of the similar name ""Wonderboys.""

I remember watching the video that fateful night thinking, ""hey, I've seen that guy before on that HBO program, Mr. Show.""  Jack Black was a triple-threat even back then.  His performance on Mr Show was full of energy and his lead role on their take of Jesus Christ Superstar was over the top!

It may have taken a few years but it's good to see the music video and even the making of it is now available.  The fact that Wonderboy is a Spike Jonze video makes sense.  I've enjoyed Spike's other videos & movies.

I can't wait to revisit the video and check out the rest of Tenacious D at last.  To me, this is a win-win DVD.  Jack Black, Spike and Wonderboys music video all in one!",1163548800,2,1108,4.248803827751196

1933632,5,B0000E2FLB,"This DVD collection includes all of the original HBO series episodes, a concert filmed in London at Brixton Academy, short films, music videos, television appearances and a few featurettes.  No need to search for Tenacious D appearances - it's all right here.  It's a great collection of material and a must-own for any Tenacious D fan.

The HBO episodes were the hook.  They created the cult following.  This was where Jack Black and Kyle Gass first got to showcase their eccentric brand of humor and music.  People either loved it or hated it - and most loved it.  You could tell immediately that Jack Black had a bright comedic future.  The songs they perform are hilarious.  The fact that the audiences at the open mic shows have no reaction, as if the songs were dead serious, makes it even more amusing.  Each episode is outstanding - and each has its' moments of irresistible hilarity.  This was a great show!

The concert at Brixton Academy in London is a hell of a show.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it is true that you should watch the HBO episodes prior to watching the concert footage.  You will no doubt enjoy the show, yet you will have missed the basis for the songs themselves, as they are revealed and dealt with in the episodes.  The Brixton show is great, though.  The interplay between Jack, Kyle and the crowd made for a wonderful dynamic - and the performance of the D certainly didn't hurt.  They were truly on their game that night and the show is amazing.

The bonus disc contains hours of additional material.  The HBO short films are filthy and funny- a great addition to the DVD.  There are ""On the Road with.."" and ""In the Studio"" featurettes that give you a look at life with Tenacious D.  They are both amusing and worth a viewing.

This is a great deal - all the Tenacious D that has ever been available for viewing is right here on this 2-disc collection.  If you're a fan of the series or the music, you've got to get it.",1139184000,26,1962,4.495750708215297

Not only is the humor side-splitting, but the music is fantastic. I am a professional guitarist, and to see some of the things these 2 pull off on acustic guitars, as well as the wonderful vocal harmonies, shows that they are not just a couple of idiots writing comical songs for the masses, they are a couple of idiots with TALENT.

Their music is great, the lyrics are hilarious, and the extras are quite cool as well.  The behind the scenes footage is really something too (Dave Grohl as the Devil?! hahaha!)

This is good stuff, great stuff and soon your mind will explode from The D too and the pieces of it will sparkle in the sun as they lie on the street reflecting the eternity of the universe. Lastly, if you're some frat guy who likes this just because it's now getting popular, oh well, you could probably be cool someday too, I still have hope for myself, so I can hope for you.

How can you not love the D?  They are music gods, especially when it comes to guitar. If you have never heard of them, this DVD is for you. If you are a fan this DVD is for you. It's for everyone, and I love it. Here's my full review!

Tenacious D: The Greatest Band on Earth (the TV Series)

Besides the concert, this is definitely the best of the package. Each episode is very very funny and a must have not only for D fans, but Jack Black fans. What this short lived hit series is about is the D trying hard to get a record deal by playing at open mic night bars. It's fictional comedy stories and not real but they are hilarious! Episodes ranging from an obsessed fan in reverse, to Kyle stealing JB's love interest, hilarity is all that follows. Excellent stuff.  This series was to go into a second season because it was a hit show but the people of HBO wanted creative rights to the D and D wouldn't have it so the show was prematurely cancelled. Here's a brief summary of what each is about.

The Search for Inspirado: Tenacious D has to come up with a new song to play at open mic night in three days because they have been singing the same song and the bar owner is tired of hearing it over and over again.

Angel in Disguise: Jack gives Kyle a friendship 4-ever medallion, Kyle will later prove his friendship.

Death of a Dream: Walking into a record store for an ""unofficial"" Tenacious D photo signing, they meet and talk to the cashier who was once upon a time also in a rock band. The cashier tell them of his glory days of a rocker in the 60's and that the dream of a being a rock star is impossible to reach. But the two he is talking to aren't mere men, they are Tenacious D!

The Greatest Song in the World: A writer moves in next door in the apartment building where Kyle and JB live, and the new tenant is upset because Kage (Kyle) and JB (Jack) keeping making noise. TD has to come up with a good exuse for the noise or they could be arrested by the police.

The Fan: Meeting an obsessed fan goes in reverse when Kyle and Jack think that their fan is cool and they begin to stalk him. *My favorite episode!!*

Road Gig: On a road trip to play at another bar, they become stranded in the desert, not because they are out of gas, but because they are out of windshield wiper fluid and there is a huge bug on the windshield.

Tenacious D: Live In London

It's back to basics when Tenacious plays a live acoustic concert of their hits from their debut album. The concert lasts a little over an hour and is very entertaining. Kyle and Jack exchange different jokes with each other, making fun and cutting down each other and a few unlucky audience members, but it's all in good fun. They really rock the house as they duel guitar, they can really play awesomely!  Stages acts are also included as JB battles an inflated hydra during the song ""Wonderboy"".

On Disc Two ""For Psycho Fans Only"", there are a bunch of tasty special features to wet your dry pallet. Here is the list of what is on the second disc and my personal thoughts of them.

Short Films:  These short films are X-rated (but not nudity) for sure and very rock but may be very offensive to some. Here's what they are in summary.

JB's BJ: Jack tries the hooker life as him gives the air a BJ (u know what I mean) in hopes that people driving in the street might pick him up. Little does he know the guy who picks him up may be someone he knows all too well, but doesn't recognize at first.

Rock Star's Sperm for Sale: Kage (Kyle) and JB (Mr. Black) decide the best way to make money is to sell their sperm, so they go into the restroom and do their business into a huge glass. When they have enough, they begin to sell it in the street by the name of what this film is called. They meet some pretty weird people.

Butt Baby: In the desert, Kyle and Jack try to go on a LSD trip only to discover that they didn't take LSD but used an E.P.T., a home pregnancy test, and even worse...Kyle's test is positive.

In the Studio

This is what it says, the making of the album ""Tenacious D"". Interviews with different staff members and a cameo by Dave Grohl.

TV Appearances

Mad TV: Tenacious D plays the song ""Tribute"" with Dave Grohl rocking out on drums. Overall great performance.

Crank Yankers: Puppet Jack and Puppet Kyle perform the song ""Friendship"" as their naked puppets (yes with their puppet wangs showing) run and act what the band is singing about. Funny, but seeing puppet genitalia wasn't necessary!

Late Night With Conan O'Brien: Dressed as superheroes, Tenacious D rock out with ""Wonderboy"". Conan's own drummer Max plays the drums during the performance and he really rocks! Those years with Bruce Springsteen have made Max a drum god!

Music Videos

Tribute- The premise of this video is simple; the two members of TD (Jack and Kyle) don't have money to record a record of their own. So they go to an in-store machine that lets you record a song, except you have to choose a previously recorded song to sing and can't record a song you wrote, that is until Jack begins to mess with the circuits. ""Tribute"" takes a less serious tone as a music video, unlike ""Wonderboy"" which ends with his death at the hands of his own sword. Yes, this is the video which features Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters making a cameo as the monster. Great song, Great video.

The Making of ""Tribute"": An in-depth look into the making of this video, I found this one to be more entertaining than the making of the Wonderboy video mainly because this has a few bloopers when their choreography doesn't go as smoothly as hoped and have to do take after take which is hilarious to watch. Another cool thing is that we see step by step how they turned Foo Fighter/Nirvana rock legend and friend to the band Dave Grohl into the snarling demon on the video. Overall, really cool stuff and a heck of a lot of fun to watch.

Wonderboy- Don't care what some people (mostly non fans) have to say about this video, ""Wonderboy"" has to be one of the best music videos I have seen. It actually looks fantastic and matches the song when it in itself feels like an epic journey. A lot of thought and imagination were put into this video, pure Rock imagination.

The Making of ""Wonderboy"": This is a pretty in-depth look at the making of the video for ""Wonderboy"". It includes interviews with the video's director Spike Jones, and interviews with Jack and Kyle. The big joke of the short documentary is that the cave in which the final scene takes place smells like crap. They talk about how they bought top soil to use for the ground of the cave, but Jack jokes that they must have really bought ""Top Soil Brand Manure"". Overall a very good look into the making of the video and it lasts longer than I had expected.

FHG: The concept for this video is that while Satan is having sex with his girl Tenacious D shows up uninvited and shows him Satan how to pleasure a lady right, and Satan sits back as he takes notes and lets Kyle and Jack work their magic. The video that I have never seen until I bought the DVD, and with good reason. This definitely wouldn't air on MTV or VH1. Raw but still funny.

On The Road

This is a very very funny movie that shows Tenacious D's tour around the world starting from day one. They go to radio stations, restaurants and everywhere else as they meet the D fans and we are allowed to follow them in their lives on the road. While on the bus they mainly hang out and play PS2 and when they eat, they usually eat the BBQ. They are even shown eating BBQ in Atlanta! I live near the Atl, I need to go check out that restaurant! Great stuff.

Overall Review

 To put it simple, this DVD is the definition of pure Rock, just like the D is the definition in life. Even though something I think are pretty raw and x-rated, and they are, doesn't mean that this is bad to get, heck no. With so much stuff, this rocks and is a must for every rock lover out there. Love it.",1123113600,5,8875,4.291966426858513
1933639,5,B0000E2FLB,"this is an incredible collection of songs and shows. the episode with captain ed and the sasquatch is a classic. captain ed telling the d about his adventures in the rock world is alone worth the price of this excellent dvd ""I ate a horse, drove a car into a hotel room, had a threeway with a pair of siamese twins, janis joplin was throwing up and doing the dishes"", etc etc....",1117152000,,379,4.277777777777778

Anyway, disc 1 is some of their HBO episodes, basically singing at an open-mic night, and ""Mad-TV"" type skits. JB is so animated through the whole thing, the guy is nuts. Also on disc 1 is a concert in London. Disc 2 (for psycho fans only) includes more sick short stories (skits), videos, TV appearances, and an ""On The Road"" segment. Both DVD's are packed. Of course besides the humor, The D totally rocks your socks off as well. Absolutely awesome, highly recommended.",1116720000,,639,4.663716814159292

1933664,5,B0000E2FLB,"Self-proclaimed ""greatest band in the world"" Tenacious D really got their start when they did a series of shorts for HBO back in the late 90's.  The comedy duo produced a full-length album in 2001.

This DVD collection contains those HBO shorts, a concert, a series of appearances on late-show, special shorts made just for the DVD, music videos for three of their songs (""Wonderboy"", ""Tribute"", and ""FHG""), a making of Tribute and Wonderboy, and commercials for the Tenacious D album.

I've never laughed so hard at the butt-baby scene, where Jack Black and Kyle Grass have a, you guessed it, butt-baby.  The gross-out humor is over-the-top and not for the mild mannered.

Anyone who's accustomed to the more sedated Jack Black (e.g. School of Rock or Shark Tales), should be warned that this is JB raw and uncensored.

This DVD set is a great bargain and sure to entertain.  If you're into sophmoric humor, this is right up your alley.",1098403200,,937,4.782608695652174
1933665,4,B0000E2FLB,"I was surprised by how good some of these songs really were. If you take away the jokes you can see these guys have some real talent, but they are hilarious anyway.  I didn't like the short 'sperm' films on disc 2, didn't see the point, and also thought it was kind of strange that with all the profanity and  mature content in the DVD they still blurred out the girls flashing the camera in the 'on the road' part. Also, I would have liked to have seen the SNL episode JB did, there were some good songs in that too.  Overall, this DVD is well worth the money.",1097798400,,561,4.128440366972477
1933666,5,B0000E2FLB,"EVERYONE has to buy this. This is one of the best band DVD sets out there. Of course it's a 2 DVD set but get it while you can because after a while there going to take away the second disc.

Of course Tenacious D is one of the best acoustic/rock groups around today. You got Jack Black with lead vocals and guitar, and Kyle Gass with lead acoustic guitar and vocals. I like how Jack Black always jokes around on stage and Kyle takes everything serious. This set is very good in all kinds of funny and gross ways.  You're getting over 3 and a half hours of footage.

DISC 1

6 HBO EPISODES- These are extremely funny and the live parts of these episodes are awesome. They were taped from 1996-1999. You get to hear some songs from the cd (no drums or electric guitar on live parts) as well as some other songs that were great but never got put on their cd. All the live parts in these episodes are done in a small bar type place on Open Mic Night and no one in the audience really likes them. Below are the list of episodes and the length of each one. I listed the songs played in each episode as well.

The Episodes are:

-The Search For Inspirado- (10:32)-SONGS- Kielbasa,,,, History of Tenacious D,,,, Kyle Quit the Band

In this episode J.B. and K.G. go through the five steps to admitting that they shouldn't have a dream of becoming a great band after they listen to Captain Ed talk about how he got no where being in a band. They end up finding Sasquatch and he tries to play the drums in their band.

-The Greatest Song in the World- (9:32)-SONGS- Greatest Song in the World (Tribute)
In this episode J.B. and K.G. get a new neighbor (a writer) in there apartment and they make him mad by making to much noise and he ends up calling the police and then J.B. tells the police officer the story of them in the desert and finding a demon which they play the greatest song in the world for.

-The Fan- (12:23)-SONGS- Explosivo,,,, Lee,,,, Special Things
This episode has a hilarious beginning in which J.B. gets mad at the audience for not giving back his clear special pick. They then meet Lee who is a fan of them and gives back K.G.'s pick. They begin to always be with Lee and end up making a song about him. The song Special Things is not very good in which they have Lee sing it.

-Road Gig- (14:05) -SONGS- Warning,,,, The Road,,,, Jesus Ranch
In this episode J.B. and K.G. go on a road gig, and while there driving there car brakes down. They end up finding a Jesus Ranch in which everyone is all religious and K.G. falls in love with a big potato that the people grow there.

That's all the HBO episodes on the first disc but that's not even half of all the stuff on the 2 discs. Next I'll list all 16 songs played in the live concert, which is an hour long and is performed at the Brixton Academy. The concert is one of the best live concerts I'v seen on DVD and features some cool solos and all of Tenacious D's songs from there cd except for City Hall and Lee. The length of each song is listed too.

15-(4:24)-Rock Your Socks (J.B.'s solo)
16-(7:27)-Double Team

1933667,5,B0000E2FLB,"When I originally saw commercials for the D, I wasn't interested. Just like Mr. Show w/Bob & David.  After watching Mr. Show, and a few of Jack Black's other 'things' I decided to buy the D's master works.  I'm so happy I did!!  I had not laughed as hard as I did after watching ""Butt Baby"" in years!! My girlfriend (at the time) had to leave because the laughing got too outrageuos for her. Oh well, her loss. It's not like she's high above the mucky muck.

The music is awesome, the concert is awesome, the videos are awesome, but the sketches take the cake.  I can't believe there are still people out there that have never heard of JB and KG.",1095724800,,646,4.262295081967213
1933668,4,B0000E2FLB,"Not much to say about the DVD except that it is fantastic.  Anyone who gets a kick out of Tenacious D, or even relatively knows who they are, should pick this up.  It is a must for all D-fans, especially those that that don't have several bootleg DVDs of concerts.

And for the person that asked about it, and for anyone else that cares...Kage told me that him and JB will be releasing a brand new album/soundtrack in conjunction with their upcoming big-screen movie Tenacious D in:  The Pick of Destiny.

Start looking for a new album in about a year.",1095033600,,552,4.425742574257426
1933669,5,B0000E2FLB,"DISC 1:

First of all, it's rare these days that a band could can come along and make rock history.  First of all there songs are comedy but rock all the same.  You get to see there amazing concert that was recorded at Brixton Academy, UK plus all of there HBO episodes.

First of all the concert is very good with some acting and JB 'slaying' a massive dragon and getting into a fight with KG causing him to quit for a minute.  This is very good for all you Jack Black fans with his comedy acts.  At the concert, they performed all the tracks I know of (with the exeptions of 'city hall' and 'Jesus Ranch').  Instead of using there comedy nuggets which they used on there album, they replaced them with acting and different comedy (e.g - JB suffering a mental breakdown).

Now on to the HBO episodes.  Theree are 6 of the original HBO epsiodes, each one being about 15 - 20 minutes long.  Even though these episodes are old it's still good for D-Ciples.  On one episode you witness JB and KG given 5 days to write a song.

DISC 2:

To start off the second disc (for psyco fans!)there  are some 'HBO Shorts', which are shorter versions of the original HBO episodes.  There are 3 of these and each one is about 3 - 5 minutes long.  These are funny but not as good as the original HBO episodes.

Next are some of the TV shows that JB and KG have featured on including the Conan O' Brian Show.  Also On the Disc Are 2 of Tenacious D's Top Videos (Tribute And Wonderboy).  Watch the 'Making Of' after to see how the videos were made.  And finally on the disc is a 'Tenacious D On The Road Documentary' and a 'Tenacious D In The Studio' Film.

There is 3 1/2 hours of entertainment spread over the 2 discs.  I highly recommend this to Tenacious D fans who are 15 yeara old or over! WARNING:ADULT MATERIAL!!!

I can't find the 'FHG' video on the DVD so don't be suprised if it's not on your version either.  Also, does anyone know when the next Tenacious D album is coming out, if so reply to this review please.",1094342400,,2006,4.218421052631579
1933700,5,B0000E2FLB,"Don't hesitate to buy this DVD!  It is the best DVD I've bought for under $20 bucks.  If you love ""The D""...BUY IT NOW...don't wait until payday; you cannot live without it.  You will laugh, cry, laugh again, go back and watch it again, get grossed out and then you will thank me!  I don't know why I waited so long to get it myself!?!",1081814400,,335,4.107692307692307
1933701,5,B0000E2FLB,"Tenacious D are GREAT. Jack Black is hellarious and is actually a really good singer and guitarist. K.G. is a GOD on the guitar. Not to mention that this collection contains some of the funniest skits ever put on video. If you're not a fan of Tenacious D, you will be. BUY THIS DVD!!",1079827200,,283,4.2592592592592595
1933702,5,B0000E2FLB,"This is an excellent collection of that most overlooked Rock phenomenon, Tenacious D.  For those who don't know, Tenacious D consist of K.G. (Kyle Gass) and J.B. (Jack Black - School of Rock / High Fidelity / Shallow Hal).  These 2 cover all the greatest of classic rock styles in their music and are actually pretty talented musicians.  Their songwriting reminds me of what we might have written when in 8th grade but it is done in such a manner that, rather than being simply stupid, it becomes ridiculous to the point of hilarity.  Not a recommended viewing for a young viewer, but any adult who remembers Led Zeppelin or Rush or even Dio from their teenage years will feel the compelling urge to laugh and enjoy their productions.  But their hilarity is not limited to this and anyone with a bit of wit should enjoy their performances.
  This DVD set includes their HBO shorts, which should strike a chord with every amateur musician out there - going from the difficulty of writers block to groupies to personal tragedy to Open Mike night.
  In the live concert portion of the DVD, KG gets the chance to show off some of his chops, which are pretty impressive regardless of the material, while Jack Black struts the stage with his usual overly flambouyant and ridiculous presence - he is so over the top that one finds it difficult to stifle the urge to chuckle.  This is the epitome of a collection for the cult of the D grown large.
  The recorded volume level on my particular DVD seems to have been cranked up quite a bit, FYI, but that's okay - this is one that should be played at 11.",1079568000,,1595,4.5
1933703,5,B0000E2FLB,"This should speak for itself, all the D stuff you'd want crammed onto one disc! Forget about what musicalgenius said. If you look at his list, he rated Queer Eye for the Straight Guy five stars, which obviously tells us that he spends alot of time in highway reststop mens room's. MEN, FOR A GOOD TIME CALL MUSICALGENIUS!",1077926400,,321,4.551724137931035
1933704,5,B0000E2FLB,"If you are a fan of KG/JB, You already have this and are lovin' it gently! If you never heard of The ""D"" well, Jack Black (Yes, the fabulous actor) and Kyle ""Cage"" Gass (Guitar extrordinaire) are a singing Duo (not DIO) with a twist of the real world (or what at least I would like it to be).
  If you never heard of them, get this DVD, it's real cheap and it's loaded with side splitting, rocking entertainment! You will become a fan fast and soon will get there CD. If you are in the search for something different or inspirado, BUY BUY BUY!",1076630400,,543,4.161904761904762

1933706,5,B0000E2FLB,"This is single-handedly the thing that will turn you into a hardcore fan of the D. The first disc will rock your socks off with the concert in England, but even better are the HBO specials(the best, in my opinion, is ""Angel In Disguise""). Disc two, ""For Psycho Fans Only"", contains even more Tenacious D shorts(not related to the HBO shorts) and all of the music videos. So, in essence, if you don't mind getting some cream in your jeans, you should definitely get this DVD.",1075075200,,474,4.523255813953488
1933707,5,B0000E2FLB,"Being a big fan of Jack Black's movies, my friend bought his band's self-titled album, Tenacious D. I thought it was OK, a few histerical moments, but that's it. So I didn't really want to buy this DVD, but instead borrowed it from another band. I'm glad I did.
While I didn't enjoy their album that much, I might have to go take another listen after this, because it is downright hilarious. The concert kind of bored me but that was probably because I wasn't too familar with their songs. But the HBO TV shows make it worth the (low) price of admission alone. They're f*ckin' hilarious. Funny stuff. My favorite episode would probably have to be ""Angel in Disguise"" and the karate scene. Genius.
The second disc is for ""Psycho Fans Only"", and while I did not consider myself one at the time, I watched it anyway. It's packed with the hilarious video for ""Tribute"" as well as a making off and the funny yet beautiful video and making of of ""Tribute"". It also comes with a animated video of ""F*ck Her Gently"", in which mini angels of JB and KG instruct Satan on what the ladies like. Also on the disc are TV appearences with them performing ""Tribute"" on MAD TV, performing ""Wonderboy"" on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and their little sketch on Crank Yankers. There's also a half hour long On the Road documentary as well as an In the Studio documentary.
Even if you absolutely hate their music, I do suggest you check this Tenacious Dvd out if you're looking for some laughs. You might even think again about buying that album...",1074556800,6,1529,4.5234657039711195
1933708,5,B0000E2FLB,"I have seen the future...its name is ""Tenacious D"".

I'm embarrassed that I payed only $14.00 for this DVD.
I wish I could give more money to JB and KG after watching this awesome DVD. I watched the entire DVD in one day. At the beginning of the day, I was wearing socks. They were immediately rocked off. The concert...awesome. The videos...awesome. The extras... awesome. Buy this DVD immediately.",1072828800,4,399,4.782608695652174
1933709,5,B0000E2FLB,"This is a must for anybody who likes Tenacious D or just wants to laugh their butt off. Tenacious D are shown playing live, in filmed sketches, and ""horsing around"" on tour. It's really cool to see all  these different aspects of the band. This DVD also drives home the fact that Jack Black and Kyle Gass are VERY talented musicians.
Here's some other good things about this DVD:
1. The cover art is amazing.
2. Even the menus are entertaining.
3. It's over 3.5 hours.
Thank you, please drive through.
P.S. GO STEAMERS!!",1072396800,4,520,4.531914893617022
1933730,5,B0000E2FLB,"I liked this DVD quite a bit more than I thought I would... it has all of their videos, a full concert, their tv show.
Making of videos.  I was VERY happy to see the Spumco video of FHG.  way to go! Buy it if you think yourself a TRUE D fan",1072224000,2,240,3.5961538461538463
1933731,5,B0000E2FLB,"I received the DVD set as a Christmas gift from a super nice boy, and I was elated.  I have been a fan of the D since I saw the shorts they did for HBO.  Besides the convenience of a compilation, I especially enjoyed getting to see the ""making of"" segments.  It's amazing what it took to make Dave Grohl into the devil.  If you like Tenacious D, or know of someone that thinks they are as hideously funny as I do, you should really get this DVD.  It will rock your socks off!",1072224000,2,475,4.01063829787234
1933732,5,B0000E2FLB,"Caution: This DVD is so potent that ovulating women should use caution when handling ""The D.""
The guitar playing is inspired, the lyrics gut-splitting, the sound crisp. Every song is so catchy, you'll be humming the tune the rest of the day. With a smile on your face. Loads of ""back stage"" features, hilarious skits, fun music. It doesn't matter if it's good.... it only matters if it rocks. Lucky for us,  Masterworks is both good *and* will rock your socks off.  Give it up for K.G, give it up for Jack Black... long live the D!
In conclusion, the gods of hard rock and comedy genius are proud to announce the birth of their two-headed baby: Tenacious D.  Complete Masterworks is a bargain at $50, but for $15... what are you waiting for!? Buy this DVD.
P.S. Beware: repeated viewing might transform you to pure Psycho Fan Stalkerazzi material.",1071964800,2,847,4.633333333333334
1933733,5,B0000E2FLB,"These two bring back the lost art of music/poetry/comedy/drama that the minstrels of years past had perfected.  The fact that they can keep a large hall full of listeners at rapt attention with unprocessed acoustic guitars and vocals is astonishing.  They are truly a unique band.  The HBO stuff is genius.  We all give hats off to Bob & David, but come on!  The D shines brightly with their comraderie and musical inventiveness.",1071187200,,429,4.821917808219178
1933734,5,B0000E2FLB,"...seldom do I consider the fortitude of those fleshy coverings that flank my mouth, however, after 10 minutes or so of watching this DVD you become acutely aware of them.  It all starts with you noticing their existence, then it feels like they have small weights hanging on them, then they start to throb.  Soon you're clutching them with your hands half laughing at the DVD, half laughing at your complete inability to control your face, and the pain...
Jack Black could be my generations funniest entertainer (hilarious in the movies Orange County and Shallow Hal), and in this ""indie feeling"" compilation you're privilaged with a more raw, less ""Hollywood"" side of him.
Definitely worth adding to your arsenal of movies designed to make anyone laugh...HARD.",1070236800,9,762,5.0396825396825395
1933735,5,B0000E2FLB,"True brilliance has previously been impossible to have in DVD form, but now we have TENACIOUS D: THE COMPLETE MASTERWORKS. The godlike duo has finally been immortalized in the format of dvd, and it truly is one of the best dvds of the year. The HBO episodes and short films are hilarious, the music videos awesome, the documentaries quote awesome as well, and everything else you'll find on this dvd (including the full concert) is completely fantastic. All a D fan will need after they have this DVD is a bottle of Rocketsauce for sustenance during the repeated viewings of THE COMPLETE MASTERWORKS.",1070064000,2,600,4.834951456310679

1933738,5,B0000E2FLB,"""Tenacious D:  TCMW"" offers a sick and twisted look into the world of an underachieving yet completely committed rock duo, consisting of current movie megastar Jack Black and his musically talented sidekick Kyle ""KG"" Gass.  Disc One features an hour-long concert for London's Brixton Academy, as well as all six episodes of the 1999 HBO comedy series.  The concert is a brilliant spotlight for the boys' true talent.  Plus, it was nice to see that the D's following spans across the Atlantic, as audience members loudly sang along with nearly every song.  The episodes were equally hilarious, showing the D's humble beginnings as bar singers.  They also let viewers in on the origins of a few of their songs.  My favorite was the episode featuring Lee, Tenacious D's superfan (and song namesake).  The band actually ends up stalking HIM, instead of vice versa!
Disc Two is labeled ""For Psycho Fans Only,"" and it features three HBO short films, a studio documentary, TV appearances, and music videos complete with behind the scenes mayhem.  The shorts stand out on this disc because they go beyond the series episodes and plunge into the realm of disgusting.  I had to turn away from the screen in a few instances, I must admit.  But they are funny, in the most naughty sense.  The studio documentary is less musical footage and more of the boys just messing around and talking smack about each other.  I guess this is what happens when you give the D a camera.  I had seen some of the TV appearances and videos before, but I enjoyed the extra glimpses nonetheless.
If you have a Tenacious D fan in your life, I recommend this as a gift for their next birthday/Christmas/wedding/bar mitzvah.  But if you think this is fun family viewing, think again.  If you won't let your teenager listen to their album, then you probably won't want them subjected to this even spicier DVD.  This is clearly for adults only.  To mature fans of the D: laugh along!",1069200000,7,1947,4.72700296735905
1933739,5,B0000E2FLB,"Tenacious D is a hilarious band and this DVD depicts them perfectly.  It contains the extremely funny HBO episodes that shows how the band started.  The London concert is very entertaining, JB and KG are always hysterical.
Along with the concert and HBO shows, the 2 disc DVD also contains the videos and making of Wonderboy and Tribute, and it has a very funny little seen video of FHG.
There is also a few short films of Jack and Kyle which are pretty distrubing but extremely hilarious.
I just bought this not too long ago and it's quickly becoming one of my favorite DVD's I own.  You won't be disappointed.",1069113600,2,611,4.536363636363636

The concert is very good.  I have some problems with the editing, but it's not too distracting.
The extras are awesome.  The short movies, the behind the scenes video, and the misic videos with the making of's, are all very welcome.
The one thing I wish was there that isn't is commentary of the episodes, but, really, I can get over that.

1933760,5,B0000E2FLB,"This is a great concert, but should be noted that there are no drums, which changes some songs signifigantly. They still rock, however, and the amount of extras on the second disc make up for it.",1069027200,2,195,4.444444444444445

It contains the legendary HBO episodes that launched their career along with videos, tv appearences, documentaries and their concert/short films.  It showcases Tenacious D's backstage rituals and antics; great for all of the diehard fans.  The HBO episodes give new fans the opportunity to view them when as the series was canceled before they had the chance.  The thing that makes this D-VD great is the music videos and short-films.
