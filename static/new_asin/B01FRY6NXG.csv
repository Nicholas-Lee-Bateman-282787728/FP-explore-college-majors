8761448,5,B01FRY6NXG,"Although the film doesnt name each segment, the film is broken into 8 short stories with a very cool wraparound story.

This anthology is packed with bad acting, nudity, drug use, foul language, gore and everything else that makes and indy movie great!

My personal favorite segments are:

Slay Bells- where a creepy plastic Santa terrorizes a pair of friends, making a sweet sleigh bells sound every time he appears.

VCR- Well, you will just have to see that for yourself!! lol

The Day the Clown Cried Blood-Probably the showpiece segment of the movie deals with an impressively creepy clown sprung to life from a childs drawing.

Angel of Death-A seemingly caring Guardian Angel prevents a man from committing suicide several times because god has a different purpose for him.

Stuffed-Has a very May vibe to it. A lonely misfit girl has nothing but stuffed animals for friends and a strange fetish for plastic dolls, befriends a sloth stuffed animal named Rufio, that has a personality all his own.

The Carnage Collection isn't for everyone but if you don't go into it expecting a masterpiece, I feel that you will be pleasantly surprised by the originality, the absolute love for the genre and care that went in to making it.",1463356800,4,1232,4.833333333333333
