8284111,4,B001BPJJ3W,"Interesting film! It dealt with some very tough subject matter, however it was very eye-opening and I have no doubt that the producers of this film accomplished with their audience what they set out to do!",1425168000,,205,4.722222222222222
8284112,4,B001BPJJ3W,"The product itself arrived before schedule due date, so that was nice. It was in great condition.
I gave it four stars because of the story line just barely brushed the pg rated version of the real horror & physical/sexual abuse that these kids went through that were sent to these schools & charter hospitals here for troubled teens, here in the US & around the world. (These places began popping up all over in the early-mid 90's). The truth is still being hiddened & covered up. I never went myself, because I wasn't a troubled teen. But, a sibling of mine did & it took my mother over a year to get my brother out of there. They wouldn't even release him to his own parents. Also an ex of mine went to one in another state & a friend of mine's boyfriend went to one in another country. The horror stories they told of these places would make a mother cry. The truth is out there. More and more teens are coming forward and telling their horror stories, trying to get the truth out there, past all the covered up lies.",1424217600,,1021,4.295336787564767
8284113,4,B001BPJJ3W,"This is a well-made film, but it seems even better once you know that writer-director-star Monty Lapica has based it on his own experiences.  Andrew is a Las Vegas teen who has been having bottled-up rage issues and drug and alcohol problems ever since the sudden death of his father two years before.  The film largely sidesteps cliche to offer some of the most intense and brutal family confrontation scenes this side of Larry Clark.  At the end of her rope, Andrew's depressed and boozy mother sends him to a rehab for troubled kids.  The rehab is hellish and filled with smug hypocritical tyrannical counselors and orderlies.  What's interesting about Self-Medicated is the nuance shown here: we understand that Andrew has problems and needs help, we are also given to show that in the dehumanizing, authoritarian environment of this particular rehab he is only going to get worse.  I won't spoil the ending, but I will say that the film's action was suspenseful, often riveting, and made me care about the characters.  Lapica, as Andrew, has some of the masculine charisma of a young Clint Eastwood, but not squinty or overbearing.  Check this one out, and you would do well to order it new from ""Self-Medicated Store,"" very reliable, fast shippers who are offering a great deal on this.",1392768000,2,1292,4.867579908675799
8284114,5,B001BPJJ3W,"Although it is a great movie to watch, I am in love with the menu design and authoring of this DVD.",1379462400,,99,3.761904761904762
8284115,5,B001BPJJ3W,I just ordered 2 copies of this movie for friends. We have a broken system to help our teens. This movie is emotional and one of the best I've ever seen on such a difficult topic. There's a reason it has won so many independent film awards!,1272585600,2,240,4.127659574468085
8284116,2,B001BPJJ3W,"I have been waiting literally years for this movie to come out on DVD.  I have been contacting people, reading blogs, and constantly checking for its release.  Finally I was able to get the movie off the self medicated website.  I was so excited to put the movie in only to be completely disappointed and wishing I could get my money back.  The biggest let down was the acting.  Except for the homeless man, the characters are all boring.  Apparantly the man who wrote and directed the movie also chose to be the main star.  Unfortunately I can only describe him as a bad actor.  In fact I knew he was a bad actor right from the beginning.  His interactions with his mother seem rehearsed and scripted instead of making it appear like a natural interaction.  The story lacked development and the movie never really grabbed my attention.  Overall it was a waste of 106 minutes.  I feel like giving it one star but since I stayed awake for the entire movie, I felt obligated to give it two.",1264377600,4,988,4.4581005586592175
