Needless to say, the video got my 16 year old daughter into precalculus by studying these videos gor a few weeks. She will began college in a few months. These cd's also were a great refresher for me. The volume is bad. I do not much car for who or how the person looks who is doing the teaching. I care about the prevalent. It's a good video that gets right to the point. It's only 5 hours. Other videos are substantially longer while presenting the same material.",1497744000,,606,4.278260869565218
8195233,1,B000Q9GEGY,"This video is so bad! The lighting sucks, and you cannot hear what the kid is saying. Yes I said kid! He looks like a college student reviewing his paper notes and rewriting them on the board. And most of the time you can't read his notes again because of the lighting. You can turn up the volume and you will hear white noise and him muttering.  Just buy the math dvd tutor, and save your money. They are the same price and time, you are going to get so much more out of that course. This dvd shouldn't be sold and if I made it I would cry from shame and guilt.",1400112000,,562,3.9734513274336285
8195234,1,B000Q9GEGY,"I got this for my husband so I wouldn't have to tutor him as much in his class.  It consisted of untalented and unenthusiastic instructor writing illegibly on a white board while mumbling in a monotone voice.  Every once in a while, a key concept would be superimposed on the screen, but most of what he wrote was unreadable.  Even if you have an infinite threshold for boredom, there is no way that someone who didn't already know this material could learn much from this.

The other reviews are obviously fakes.",1189728000,8,513,4.604395604395604
8195235,5,B000Q9GEGY,"If you need help with College Algebra, you will not regret purchasing Jason's ""College Algebra Tutorial DVD.""  I highly recommend the DVD set because Jason does an excellent job teaching you the examples step by step.  I haven't taken Algebra for quite some time and this was an excellent refresher.  This is definitely worth it if you plan to CLEP out of College Algebra class or even review for ACT or SAT tests.",1180569600,,414,4.6438356164383565
8195236,5,B000Q9GEGY,"I am a repeat customer of Jason Hankins.  I purchased his College Alebra DVD series and found them to be very helpful.  No bells and whistles, just really good explanation of the problems.  I highly recommend his DVD's!",1179360000,,219,4.7105263157894735
8195237,5,B000Q9GEGY,I am very pleased with these CD's. Jason Hankins takes you step by step in explaining each example. He does not assume that you already know how to do the work. What I like most is that you can view the work repeatedly until you understand what Jason is explaining to you. I am looking forward to purchasing other titles in his collection. They are wonderful! Don't hesitate in purchasing them if you need help in the subject area.,1179014400,,431,4.468354430379747
8195238,4,B000Q9GEGY,"What I found most helpful about these DVDs was the same thing that lead me to buy them, you can watch the steps over and over until the process makes sense. My teacher went in different directions in our community college algebra class, but the formulas that were presented in the DVDs we did use. I just wish they covered everything, and the music was hilarious!",1178409600,,363,4.515151515151516
