8542401,2,B009K8XFKU,"This video is aimed at those with very limited ability. I enjoy Restorative practice, but this is even too slow for me. I will not be using it.  Would be good for someone in recent recovery from surgery.  That is what it says it is aimed at. Somehow I missed that. The video is ok just not for me.  I will see if I can donate it to the Cancer Center.",1408924800,3,350,3.9014084507042255
8542402,3,B009K8XFKU,"I watched a few segments of this and realized there was going to be more of the same-
it showed a women in pose with music in the background.  No instruction as to how to place
props, what the pose is good for, how to modify- it might be useful for someone who wanted
to observe another person in restorative yoga, but I found this production a disappointment.",1390176000,4,360,4.294117647058823
8542403,5,B009K8XFKU,"This yoga CD met my expectations and was helpful for me in my practice of yoga.  I find that the weakness I've had on my right side is lessoning and I had no muscle spasms while practicing.  It is important to watch the CD at least one time through before beginning to actually practice, as props are needed for support.",1381708800,3,320,4.316666666666666
8542404,5,B009K8XFKU,"I found this DVD to be easy to follow.  I feel refreshed, focused and positive when I am finished.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who needs time to recharge.",1352764800,4,165,4.290322580645161
8542405,5,B009K8XFKU,"I was fortunate to be able to attend Diana's restorative yoga classes in person, but then I moved to another state. Since then, I have been hoping that Diana would produce her own yoga DVD and, happily, that day has arrived. Through voice over, Diana guides you through a series of gentle yoga sequences while also introducing breathing techniques. The camera shots are perfectly paced and feature the yoga model demonstrating the postures while Diana gives voice over instruction. The floor based sequences are very gentle and slow paced, encouraging you to really settle into the pose and the moment. Throughout the practice, Diana gives clear guidance, explaining the movements and breathing techniques, and her voice is calming, peaceful, and encouraging.

The DVD set up gives you a choice in how you want to practice the sequences; you can either choose to practice all of the sequences in order, all at once, or you can choose a particular sequence and practice it on it's own.

Since this is a prop specific gentle restorative practice, I found it helpful to preview the DVD sequences so that I knew what ""home props""--such as couch cushions, pillows and blankets--I would need and then gathered them up so that I had them nearby and ready.

This DVD is now a priceless and beloved addition to my home yoga DVD collection. Perfect for days when I need to slow down, settle in, and deeply relax.",1351900800,14,1402,4.833333333333333
8542406,5,B009K8XFKU,I sent this video to my two dear friends who have breast cancer.  I take a yoga class myself with the creator of this DVD and I know her to be an extremely knowledgeable teacher who knows exactly the poses that will leave you feeling perfect for days. She also can teach you how to vary the posture for everyone from beginners to experts.  Try this DVD and you will be amazed. Enjoy!,1349827200,3,383,4.232876712328767
8542407,5,B009K8XFKU,I have been doing this yoga for over ten years.  It is relaxing and the breathing techniques are marvelous.  Anyone can do this very gentle yoga - most of it is lying on the floor!  Although it is specifically for breast cancer it is also very good for stress relief and back relief.  It is good for all ages.,1349395200,11,309,4.186440677966102
