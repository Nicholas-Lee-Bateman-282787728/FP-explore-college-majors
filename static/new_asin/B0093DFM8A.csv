5255509,2,B0093DFM8A,"When the big dramatic payoff of a movie is the King of England eating a hot dog (and whether he'll have mustard), you know you're in trouble.

So it is with ""Hyde Park on Hudson,"" a wishy-washy little movie that has about twenty minutes of actual movie in it. But this story about Daisy Suckley, FDR's distant relative and possible lover, is so painfully padded out that it feels like spending a weekend with a bunch of really dull people you don't like -- and nothing dramatic ever builds up to anything.

Daisy (Laura Linney) is summoned by her sixth-cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt (Bill Murray), who is the president of the US in the years approaching World War II. She becomes his confidante, friend, and possibly a bit more (see the wandering hands in a field of flowers), while remaining clueless about the exact nature of his relationships with his wife Eleanor (Olivia Williams) and his assistant (Elizabeth Marvel).

The story mostly follows a particular couple of days, when the newly crowned King George VI (Samuel West) and Queen Elizabeth (Olivia Colman) are visiting in hopes of forging an alliance against the Nazis. During the king's stay, Daisy is made not-so-shockingly aware that she is not the only woman in her cousin's life. Will she leave, or settle? And will Bertie eat a hot dog? (Seriously, there is DRAMA over that!)

One question kept flitting through my mind as I watched this movie: What is the point of ANYTHING that is going on? Despite having two potentially interesting stories flitting through it, ""Hyde Park on Hudson"" leaves you with the feeling that absolutely nothing has happened -- or at least, nothing important.

Instead, director Roger Michell focuses on everything that doesn't actually matter in the long-run -- we get a whole scene devoted to FDR's mother freaking out because she doesn't want her son offering cocktails to his guests. RIVETING. About half of the movie is watching the British royals twitter and fuss, and the other half is watching the limp, lifeless Daisy wandering around looking sad. There are a few blow-ups -- Daisy gets angry at FDR, the royals have a tiff -- but they don't lead to anything.

It also has some fairly unpleasant implications, such as that Daisy's life as a second-string mistress is better than anything else she could have, or that FDR cheats on Eleanor because she's just a mean ol' lesbian. The movie even implies that the ONLY reason that America became embroiled in World War II was because George VI charmed Americans by eating a hot dog. It's almost farcical.

About two-thirds of the way through the movie, there IS a twenty-minute period that is both charming and powerful -- most of it is devoted to Bertie and FDR having a candid talk that exposes both their vulnerabilities and feelings about each other. It's a lovely, low-key scene... which ends when we get back to the effing hot dogs.

The casting is a pretty mixed bag. Murray is absolutely transcendent as FDR, capturing mannerisms, attitudes and a gentle, genial sense of humor -- he deserves a better movie around this performance. Samuel West is obviously overshadowed by the ""Bertie"" of Colin Firth, but he's quite good as a young, green king who gains some confidence from his paternal American counterpart.

Unfortunately, Laura Linney is utterly wasted here -- Daisy is a dowdy, perpetually downtridden blank with little personality of her own. And Colman is horrendously miscast as the Queen Mum, coming across as brittle and neurotic, like a suburban housewife who needs some Xanax.

""Hyde Park on Hudson"" is a movie entirely made to win awards, not to be a story unto itself -- a few good performances and a few beautiful scenes, adrift in a soup of mediocrity.",1364860800,6,3730,4.85062893081761
5255510,3,B0093DFM8A,"Bill Murray is utterly brilliant in this film; he totally disappears into the role.

5255512,5,B0093DFM8A,"Oh my gosh! First let me just say that this is a steamy, riveting, smoking-hot and sexy thriller. Bill Murray as FDR was amazing and this portrayal hearkens back to his solid acting roles like Tripper Harrison in Meatballs or the voice over work in the movie Garfield.

 My underwear moistened with every line of dialogue.

 Now with that said, they go and add the queen of England?!?! Laura Linney brings stuffy English sexuality right into your living room! I almost couldn't concentrate on Hyde Park, nothing gets me hotter than Diplomacy, Brits and Polio.

I was at the edge of my seat and had to pause to take several bathroom breaks..  but that was because of the crippling diarrhea I have at the moment, it got to the point that I just couldn't take it anymore so I brought my Kindle Fire into the bathroom and finished the movie on the toilet.

This film is a whirlwind of emotions, like if you put Full Metal jacket together with Forest Gump and added a dash of Marie Antoinette. ""The action hit of the summer""....""a non stop action thrill ride""....""explosive"".... The critics agree,
 Hyde Park on the Hudson will go through you like black coffee and Indian food.",1364428800,10,1172,4.628019323671498
5255513,1,B0093DFM8A,"this movie should have come with a clothe's pin. whoa!! what a stinker! Laura Linney was empty, vapid, and void of any emotions but bewildered and angry. Bill Murray toned down to a dull khaki-baby-poop tan emotionally had nothing clever to say, and made little effort to emote any kind of human qualities.
 the film held long silent sequences too long, took no advantage of dialogue that could have made an excellent show, and had no humor, no real sadness and no direction whatsoever.
 beautifully filmed and cast with excellent character actors i wasted $14.99 on buying this ""bowl floater"" and could have ordered pizza and watched another Hitler movie for the tenth time.",1364428800,3,675,4.912280701754386

Michell does his most inspired work with Hyde Park on the Hudson. Moment to moment he brings the essence of emotion clearly to the screen. From wide shots to close-ups that define each emotion and motive of the characters. The movie has great impact, such as in a scene that goes from quiet contemplation to a violent awakening for one of the lead female characters.

Laura Linney and Bill Murray were brilliant in this drama.
Based on actual events this DVD didn't 100 % come together with two separate story strands one involving the 1939 visitation of the King and Queen of Great Britain, Northern Ireland & the British Empire and the second about the relationship between FDR and his cousin, Betsy.
Nonetheless a delightful period drama which I loved..................and the music was similarly wonderful.",1426377600,,488,5.35064935064935
5255581,2,B0093DFM8A,"It wasn't until ""St Vincent"" that I had any admiration for Bill Murray. His smarmy, snotty attitude toward people at large has almost always annoyed me. He didn't try to copy FDR, which is to his credit, but an essential part of the character was missing in this film. A bold casting choice, indeed.
The character of this enigmatic American icon was displayed as bland and downright uninteresting.

Laura Linney is one of my favorite actresses, having proved herself repeatedly, but she's not given a lot to work with, here. It's a vapid and boring character, and even Ms Linney's great gifts couldn't transcend the script and her character as written.

The whole idea of this film screams comedy, but there's little. If it wasn't for the appearance of the King of England and his wife, the film would've been a bust. Indeed, Olivia Colman as Elizabeth, was the most energetic character, though not written as such. THAT is acting.

There was too much attention made to caricature and period detail, there was no room for true creativity among the cast members; writing was pedestrian. Linney's voice-over was good, but the character itself left me flat. As did the whole film. I wanted to like this film.

However both Laura Linney and Bill Murray was a joy to watch. This is one of the few performances that Bill completely altered the tone of his voice (to mimic FDR... I assume) and his body language that I forgot that it was him.  Judging from the few stars this movie get on this forum, I know that I am one of those minorities that really enjoy the movie.  The movie was told from the point of view of Margaret, as a woman in love with his cousin.  So it was interesting how she viewed the world - the war, and the relationship between the U.S. and British.  According to her opinion, it was forged over a simple traditional American meal.

5255602,4,B0093DFM8A,"Hyde Park on the Hudson, features comedian Bill Murray as FDR.  This is not a grandiose epic historical film like Lincoln, but has a narrower focus on the significance of interpersonal relationships.  This film was greeted by modest box office receipts and no Academy award nominations.  While not a great film by any means, it does not lack historical interest or charm.

The film is set in the summer of 1939, before the start of World War II in Europe and before Pearl Harbor.  It chronicles the relationship between FDR and his distant cousin Margaret ""Daisy"" Suckley, played by Laura Linney, and the relationship between FDR and King George VI ( of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-King-s-Speech-Road-to-the-Throne/dp/B004SKJTY6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The King's Speech: Road to the Throne</a>).  The film concludes with King George VI, played by Samuel West, bravely sacrificing his dignity and eating a hot dog in front of the world press at a summertime picnic in update NY.

FDR was a vain man, a complicated man and an unfaithful husband.  His devastating bout with polio crippled him physically while strengthening his capacity for empathy and his indomitable will; it also, however, increased his need to deceive the public about the nature and extent of his disability.  He was surrounded by powerful opinionated women like his domineering mother and his proto-feminist wife Eleanor.  He escaped their clutches in the company of willing ladies such as Lucy Mercer, Marguerite LeHand, ""Daisy"" Suckley and, perhaps, even Princess Martha of Sweden who found refuge living in the White House during World War II!  Who would have suspected that a man disabled by polio could get around so much?  FDR was a philandering philatelist -- ""don't you want to come over here and admire my beautiful stamps?""  Both Lucy Mercer and ""Daisy"" Suckley were with FDR in Warm Springs, GA on the day that he died.

In Hyde Park on the Hudson we see a fragile President of the United States being carried around his house by his handlers in order to receive his royal visitors.  In a memorable scene FDR, played, by Bill Murray is able to drive a specially designed hand-operated automobile (a 1936 Ford Phaeton).  FDR sheds his secret service detail and puts the car in park in a lovely country meadow while Laura Linney, for her part, displays her own talents for digital manipulation of POTUS.

This is not a fairy tale romance.  Linney's Daisy is accommodated and learns to accept a position in the Presidential harem.

In 1939 King George VI, Elizabeth II's father, was a young monarch with a stuttering problem who had unexpectedly become King on his brother's unexpected abdication.  He initially lacked confidence in his kingship and he sensed, correctly, that his Empire was on the verge of a devastating war for which it was unprepared and would require American assistance.  King George VI's visit in 1939 marked the first time that an English monarch had ever visited the United States of America.

FDR strikes up a warm fatherly relationship with young King George VI over their country weekend in upstate New York.  America will support Britain in the war to come in spite of the isolationism espoused by so many Americans.

The course of history is often shaped by chance and the success or failure of interpersonal relationships.  Imagine a counter factual history without Wallis Simpson where King Edward VIII had visited FDR at Hyde Park.  Would he have eaten a hot dog at a picnic or bonded with FDR?  How might this have affected the course of the Second World War?  The friendship between FDR and George VI marked the beginning of the ""special relationship"" between Britain and the USA and prefigured the close but uneasy relationship between FDR and Churchill in the war.  It is ironic to note that this relationship was launched with the consumption of a German snack food -- the Frankfurter.

One mild casting complaint/observation is that the British actress who plays Eleanor, Olivia Williams, is much more attractive than the historical first lady.  Much of Hyde Park on Hudson was filmed on location at FDR's New York home.

Stamp collecting can be a very rewarding hobby and be sure to check out Hyde Park on the Hudson!

5255614,4,B0093DFM8A,"This is not a great movie.  And yet....

This is also not a bad movie.  After watching the Ken Burns series, I decided it was a good idea to watch every FDR/ER movie I could find. I've seen everything from the ""Eleanor and Franklin"" 1970's miniseries to the HBO's 2005 ""Warm Springs,"" but I dreaded watching ""Hyde Park on the Hudson"" because I remember hearing that it was lewd and poorly written.  But I finally bit the bullet today and decided to watch via my Amazon app, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not a bad movie.

For some reason everybody thought it was a good idea to sell this to the public as some kind of a jokey, raunchy, rowdy, iconoclastic romp through FDR's private life. And while there is some...romance between FDR and Daisy their relationship isn't actually the focus of the movie.  It's Daisy's focus to be sure, but in reality this is a movie about FDR and the women in his life one of whom happens to be Miss Daisy Suckley.

Murray's FDR is a lot like the real FDR: lonely and disabled and in pain because of his polio, but also bright and funny and charismatic and silly and jaunty with his hats and his cigarettes and his cocktails and his huge smile.  Mother Roosevelt is also done very well in this movie, as are George VI and Queen Elizabeth (particularly George VI), and the Indian baritone.  The Eleanor in this movie didn't seem like Eleanor Roosevelt at all, but other than that...

This movie was made to be Oscar bait, but it didn't quite make it.  Nevertheless, there's something fun about it and I recommend it for a rainy afternoon.",1413676800,,1593,4.458620689655173

5255616,4,B0093DFM8A,"This is an excellent movie about the visit of the king and queen of Englands visit in 1939 to FDR's home in New York State literally months before the start of World War II.  Bill Murray gives an very good portrayal of FDR although he does not have the Brahmin accent down correctly.  The movie also goes (quite well) into the affair he had with his 5th cousin Daisy Suckley.  Most of the material for the movie came from a series of letters as well as a diary that Daisy kept during this time period.  She told no one about it and it was actually discovered under he bed when she died at 100 years old in the 1990's.  I only gave it 4 stars however, because there are a LOT of historical innacuracies in the movie.  For instance, the movie leads one to believe the first time the King and Queen met FDR was when they drove to Hyde Park.  In reality, they came to Washington DC first and there was a big parade in their honor in which they rode with FDR and Eleanor in cars.  The visit to Hyde Park came at the end of the visit (after side trips to Virginia and the New York Worlds Fair).  Also, both FDR's home and Daisy's Wilderstein) look nothing like the real homes (both can be toured by the public).  I also think the shipping cost was a bit high.  I ordered 5 DVD's and a book but because they all came from different vendors, I had to pay almost $4 shipping on each one.

I think it's common knowledge FDR was a philanderer, but I loved Bill Murray's unique portrayal of this enigmatic personality.  Murray was mesmerizing, and it is one of his greatest roles if only because of the authenticity and vulnerability he brings. Well done.

This is a man whom Carl Jung analyzed as ""perfectly ruthless, a highly versatile mind which you cannot foresee...a most amazing power complex...the stuff of a dictator absolutely. The man Bill Murray portrayed was not the FDR of history.

Even more disturbing were the slanderous interpolations the producers inserted into the historical record. Without any basis in historical fact, they portray him forcing his cousin into giving him [sexual relief of a manual nature] in the front seat of a convertible, after which she became one of his several mistresses. I'm no fan of FDRs, but that disgusting depiction is an injustice to the lady, not to mention FDR.

The promos made it seem to focus on a critical meeting between the president and the king prior to the war. Instead, the meeting was just a backdrop  for a story about presidential infidelity. There were just a few short scenes regarding the meeting (dinner, late night drinks, and picnic) with no exploration of why the meeting was needed or how they reached a meeting of the minds proceeding into war. But even the focus on presidential infidelity was done just as poorly. Just a skimming over of a few events with no real development of why these people were behaving this way or effective communication about their feelings. Just .....

FDR had had a number of these friendships over the years, including Lucy Mercer Rutherford (with whom he had a physical love affair that nearly ended his marriage), his secretary Missy LeHand, another distant cousin Laura Delano, and others.  Especially in the years after polio crippled him they gave him something his wife Eleanor, influential and powerful in her own right, apparently could or would not.

This film does a good job depicting Roosevelt and Daisy's friendship, especially during an important weekend in 1939 when King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the first British monarchs to visit the US, were guests at Hyde Park.  Hyde Park was and is a splendid old mansion on the Hudson River which in the 1930s belonged to Roosevelt's indomitable mother Sara Delano Roosevelt. The King and Queen spent a private weekend there, famously being served hot dogs at a picnic organized by the First Lady. It was a critical moment for the British, who were on the verge of war with Germany.  King George VI had just come to the throne two years earlier when his older brother suddenly abdicated, and with his stammer and shyness he did not cut an impressive figure.  In the film we see FDR offering him encouragement and good advice that apparently stood him in good stead.

I enjoyed this film very much.  I've read quite a bit about both the Roosevelts and the King and Queen, and their depictions are accurate for the most part.  There are plenty of amusing moments, and the cast, led by Bill Murray as FDR and Laura Linney as Daisy, is superb.  What I found most appealing was the sense that I had been allowed a glimpse of the private world FDR created for himself and his closest friends.  If you enjoyed ""The King's Speech"" this film will give you more insights into  the King and Queen, and if you remember the 1970s TV mini-series ""Eleanor and Franklin"" you will also see some additional perspectives here.",1404950400,2,2372,4.796068796068796
5255647,5,B0093DFM8A,This effort is written from quite a different perspective and centers around FDR and his personal life. While it includes a most significant historical event it is less a historical story line and more of a third person story line about FDR. Written from the quite close perspective of one of his cousins it explains her view of FDR and their close personal relationship on his many visits to his mother's Hyde Park home while he was President prior to WWII. It is a close up view from one of his interment relationships - somewhat tainted views of his wife and female staff result is this story ---- but it is based on her letters and journals and to that degree they are historical. I like the movie very much and would  watch it again.,1404950400,,738,4.466666666666667

5255650,3,B0093DFM8A,"It's June, 1939.  The Old World Order is about to be bombed into oblivion.  In September, Hitler will invade Poland, and England and France will end almost a decade of delusional, self-defeating appeasement, which has only made Hitler stronger.  Within the year, France will have fallen to the Third Reich, and England will be left to stand alone, saved only by Hitler's disastrous blunder (invading the USSR) and awaiting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that will bring the US into the war, two years almost too late.

FDR, knowing that things are slipping out of control, invites the royal couple to add a US visit to their Canadian trip, so he can use them to put a human face on Britain, for the isolationist American public.  It's the beginning of a beautiful friendship, of sorts;  or as Winston Churchill would put it ""America can always be counted on to do the right thing, after it's tried all the other options.""  So, after two days of formality in D.C., the two power couples decamp to Roosevelt's Hudson Valley estate at Hyde Park, where the King wins America's heart by eating a hot dog.

We're kind of simple that way...

This film opens in Hyde Park, at the nearby estate of a distant Roosevelt cousin, Daisy, who is summoned to the FDR compound there by his mother, Sara, who says her son feels lonely (He already has a wife, and a mistress, but a mother's concern knows no bounds). The call can barely be heard over the yapping of a black scotty, which if memory serves, the movie neglects to tie in:  It's cousin Daisy who gave FDR his famous black scotty Fala.

For all intents and purposes, this is a romantic film about FDR and Daisy, and could have been titled ""I Pleasured The President (And Met The King And Queen of England)"" as it seems that on one cross country drive FDR puts Daisy's hand in his lap, and I don't mean by his knees...  They don't get much into what actually happened between them (she seems to have come into the picture just as he is learning to walk, again, after being stricken with polio) and the King and Queen are little more than props.  This is the same stuttering George VI of which a full movie was made quite recently, but Queen Elizabeth (the mother of the current Q-Liz) is nothing more than a fretting, frowning, worry-wart, none of her fortitude or sense of humor comes through whatsoever.

So, you've just read far more history than the movie even tries to suggest, thus if you opt to watch this film, your only question will be:  Why the hell can't I rent it?  I had to reinstate dvd's on my Netflix account to watch this film, so no, I'm not advocating you spend the money to purchase it.  It's good, but I don't see it as worth owning, especially as one would hope it will eventually be available to stream, as it should be.",1402531200,,2791,4.484189723320158

There's a lot of talk, a good bit of which appears to be oblique references to things other than what the characters were actually talking about. Some of it was interesting, such as Roosevelt driving a car which had hand controls, but most of it, supposedly told by a distant cousin who was called to the house to ""keep him entertained"" and falls under his spell, were just plain boring.  The only part of the entire movie which was entertaining was the visit of the king and queen of England, with their surprise at the way things were run in the household, the problems with the king's stutter, and their reactions to being served hotdogs at luncheon.

Laura Linney is his sixth cousin Margaret ""Daisy"" Suckley, who, according to the film, is invited to the president's house in Hyde Park, N.Y., becomes his confidant, and gets romantically involved with him. I don't know whether or not the film is historically accurate, but at least the names of the players are intriguing.

I like the film's nostalgic tone and the amusing performance of Bill Murray (Golden Globe-nominated for the role) as the president, though I find two supporting characters more interesting - King George VI (excellent Samuel West) and Queen Elizabeth (Olivia Colman) who visit the United States, staying at the Roosevelts at Hyde Park.

The film is set in 1939 and the looming shadow of war hangs over their country. King George VI (portrayed by Colin Firth in ""The King's Speech"") has travelled with an important objective, but what they see and do at the president's house is something unexpected, sometimes not so pleasant.

Thus ""Hyde Park on Hudson"" provides two storylines, none of which is fully developed. The film attempts to portray these people as humans with emotions, but somehow fails to give them a real conflict to face, or a story to tell.

As for the rest of the film.  This is based on one aspect of FDR's jaunts to Hyde Park, the family home.  More to the point his mother's home because Eleanor wasn't much in the picture here.  The other premise involves the visit of King George VI and his wife Elizabeth to try and get the U.S. to support Britain in their fight against the Germans.  And the last part of this story deals with the president's relationship with his fifth cousin, Daisy, who happens to live with her aunt near Hyde Park.

The characters were all poorly cast.  Bill Murray as FDR was unbelievable.  The actress that played Eleanor couldn't even emulate her voice.  Mama Sarah was overplayed.  Both the King and the Queen, well, where are Helena Bonham Carter and Colin Firth when we need them?  Plus it's hard to fathom that they even spoke about their hosts in that way.  About the only one that was credible was Laura Linney in the role of Daisy, but she is an accomplished actress who can play just about any part.  All the dialogue was forced, slow, hesitant.

The negatives: even at only about 90 minutes, the movie dragged. I fell asleep briefly a couple of times, and it didn't seem to affect my understanding of the plot at all. To say the movie is a ""simplistic"" look at that extremely complex historical time is a massive understatement. Most of the time, the movie focuses only on its very narrow subject: the leader of the free world finds much-needed R&R in his home in tony Hyde Park, far away from Washington. The looming war and the Great Depression are sub-plots and no depth is attached to those topics in this story, nor do we see the POTUS discharging many (any?) presidential duties.

I'm not an FDR scholar, but was this (I thought) heroic man actually a weak, sad, fumbling mama's boy, and a womanizer? That is kind of the image I'm left with, after watching this movie.

At movie's end, a statement appears onscreen, ""America eventually agreed to help Great Britain..."" in World War II. Um, a little thing called Pearl Harbor was, I thought, what propelled America into WWII. No matter. That one statement was among the very few references in this movie to the greater world outside Hyde Park.

Recommendation: Fans of Bill Murray won't want to miss this. Not sure it holds much interest for others. Now that I've written my review, I'm going to read others here, hoping to find more clues as to whether or not this was an accurate depiction of FDR.",1378598400,,1760,4.686084142394822

5255706,3,B0093DFM8A,"Depicting the long-term relationship between FDR (Bill Murray) and his distant cousin Daisy (Laura Linney), HYDE PARK ON HUDSON is an excellent character-study of a US President making the best of his disability yet remaining true to his nature.  A serial philanderer yet sincere friend, he is someone whom people have to get to know; he will not change.  Daisy understands this through painful experience, forming a friendship that lasted throughout Roosevelt's lifetime.  Richard Nelson's screenplay also focuses on the encounter between FDR and King George VI (Samuel West); like the President, the King suffers from a disability - his stammer - but through an encounter with FDR he learns to come to terms with it, forming the basis for a lasting friendship that was sustained on a personal as well as a national level.  Sadly HYDE PARK ON HUDSON is let down by its determination to observe the hackneyed conventions of the period drama; there are too many spurious shots of sun-drenched landscapes, or period cars drawing up and departing from FDR's stately home.  Some of the supporting performances are over-drawn: Olivia Colman's Queen Elizabeth comes across as a xenophobic prude, unable (or perhaps unwilling) to contemplate alternative lifestyles.

5255715,1,B0093DFM8A,"When I first heard about Hyde Park on Hudson, I was excited as having read about the famous meeting between George VI and President Roosevelt in 1939. After watching the film, I feel that though the basic concept was sound the film itself failed to live to my expectations. First the Hyde Park weekend was part of a longer trip made by George VI and Queen Elizabeth who previously toured Canada and Washington DC. Both Eleanor and Franklin meet and hosted them at the White House yet nothing seems mentioned or hinted about their trip prior to Hyde Park. Furthermore the portrayal of King George and Queen Elizabeth lacks considerable historical facts. Elizabeth helped her husband to build his confidence and abilities before his coronation in 1937. Alongside Lionel Logue, Elizabeth helped to control his stammer famously depicted in the King's Speech. More importantly the interaction on screen seems forced and insincere when they were happily married couple with two daughters until the Abdication in 1936. Moreover Elizabeth as I far as have read did not utilize the example of Edward VIII as in the manner regarding George VI's actions. The historical Queen Mother felt very strongly on Edward VIII's actions in 1936 especially the Abdication Crisis.

Alongside the portrayal of the royal guests, that of Daisy Suckley lacks momentum, she is introduced as the narrator of events yet her interaction with FDR seems limited and underdeveloped. Her appearance at times seems lacking in vitality and confidence. For several years the historical character and President Roosevelt shared a deep friendship but in the film it appears centered entirely around FDR. Moreover Daisy's appearance seems modest and unkempt even during the royal arrival. It would be interesting to read her account of the hot dog meeting. At the beginning there is little character development only references to her aunt, nothing about her early life or education. We know that she breed Scottish terriers but other than their appearance early on, no interaction is evident!!!

With Franklin D. Roosevelt though Bill Murray does capture the jovial side to the President, there is little emphasis on the discussions he and King George had about the situation in Europe!!! I am not sure whether FDR and Missy LeHand had an affair but there was a strong bond between them. At times there it seems his relationship with Eleanor is tense and lacking in depth. Following the Lucy Mercer affair they had redeveloped their marriage. Indeed both had similar views especially during the New Deal Years and worked together. I wish they had developed the relationship between FDR and",1377388800,2,2649,5.1013824884792625

Co-star is Laura Linney, lookin' old as Franklin's 5th cousin.

From IMDb: ""The story of the love affair between FDR and his distant cousin Margaret ""Daisy"" Suckley, centered around the weekend in 1939 when the King and Queen of the United Kingdom visited upstate New York.""

The King is an amiable young man with a bad stutter and his wife is a Yankee-phobe just trying to find every reason not to enjoy herself at Roosevelt's beautiful estate located about an hour north of NYC. (I've been there. It's fabulous.) She even sees an afternoon picnic where the main course is hotdogs as an intentional insult to the Crown.

The filmmakers don't miss a chance to paint Eleanor Roosevelt (Olivia Williams) as a dyke who turns a blind eye to her husband's indiscretions. She and her girlfriends live in a separate house where their hobby is building furniture. OKaaayy.

While Franklin entertains his guests and snubs Daisy (doesn't invite her to dinner with the royals), she feels neglected, but who cares? Murray is uncharming as her cousin and seems much too old to be philandering. That he does shows that the best and brightest among us can do stupid things.

5255729,2,B0093DFM8A,"My review contains spoilers!
FDR's mother sends for his sixth (or fifth) cousin, Daisy, whose family used to be rich, but now isn't, to amuse her son. Daisy lives with and takes care of her aunt, rubbing her legs and putting on her stockings for her in the morning. Daisy is timid and unsure of herself, and is honored to be in the presence of FDR. They take rides every day in his specially fitted car, because Eleanor doesn't want to (or so he says). After sharing apparently intimate moments with FDR, Daisy believes that she is someone special to him (although she is not invited to the dinner they give to the King and Queen of England). Daisy finds out that he is also intimate with his secretary Missy, and Missy tells her, some rich woman who built a house near the house he built, for when he retired. She is devastated. But Missy persuades her that she will accept this and ""share"" FDR with them. Since she's such a wimp, she does. But Daisy had a very dull boring life. What did it matter to her if she spent time with FDR or with Missy? It was companionship that she needed. But she could have at least gotten him to buy her a new hat! She wears the same pathetic little straw hat throughout.

After the special dinner, the king wants to talk privately with FDR.  He has a speech which says something about how terrible war is and children being bombed. But then they get on to his stutter and FDR's polio, and how people only see what they want to see, etc.  They have some good laughs and become good buds and FDR decides to befriend England (the king was so nervous he wouldn't) and join them in war as if it's no big deal.

There is a big fuss with the hot dogs at the picnic for the King and Queen. The Queen Mum doesn't like it and said his brother would never eat a hot dog. Why not? Anyway, the king eats one but it doesn't show if she does or not.

I could never forget that Bill Murray was playing FDR. There was a lot of gunk on his face but it was just distracting and made me think ""That's Bill Murray"" all the more. I also kept thinking that ""Missy"" was being played by Jane Alexander, but had to remind myself, ""No, that can't be.""

This part of the story ties in nicely with FDR's relationship with the King if for no other reason than to point out that powerful men who are revered by millions are, underneath it all, still just men who can eat hot dogs.

To the extent that HYDE PARK focuses on Franklin Roosevelt's sexuality, an analysis of the predicament of American women who had the vote but few positions in high office is sacrificed to a cloying narrative about the etiquette of exploitation.  A film that might have illuminated the epic achievements of two men who, in spite of crippling disabilities, helped craft a successful defense of freedom in its darkest hour is instead a tedious melodrama.",1376179200,2,853,5.303703703703704

5255762,4,B0093DFM8A,"FDR. Saint or sinner? This movie shows President Roosevelt stripped of his media facade. We see him drinking and carrying on with his distant cousin. We see him as a man who could put anyone at ease...the consummate politician. And most importantly, we see him in a wheelchair and also physically carried from place to place within his house like a baby. We get a very good understanding of the reality of his life. Somehow, for all the years of his political life, the public was unaware of this important fact. This is at once shocking and uplifting. Obviously, he was a man of incredible physical and mental strength who could command a great nation even as he suffered with his affliction. Thus, the movie highlights his strengths and his weaknesses, physically and morally. This is a welcome change in the historical depiction of the popular four-time president.

Bill Murray provides a very low-key FDR, kind of an ""At Home with FDR"" approach. Only when the photographers are present does Murray's FDR pop into the newsreel character we know and love. Murray creates a pleasant characterization which rings true. The story is simple. The pace is slow. But the ""a fly on the wall"" viewpoint for the movie audience is most intriguing and satisfying.

If you're looking for action, this is not the movie, but if you want a thoughtful look behind the curtain at the man who ran the United States from 1932 to 1945, try HYDE PARK ON THE HUDSON.",1374019200,,1445,4.73015873015873

However, I wish if the movie makers were going to ignore the real facts then why did they not take it further?There were so many opportunities to really let go.no, I am not talking about gratuitous sex scenes.
The best part of the movie ***spoiler alert*** was when the king and queen were speculating about Daisy, the secretary etc. a few more behind the scenes goings on would have brought some refreshing energy into this.
Bill Murray is so constrained. Where is the legendary FDR charisma? The humorous, the eloquent spokesman? And if he was infatuated with Daisy I could not find a reason why. I could see parts of the comic Bill Murray itching to come out.
FDR was a complex, man who despite his physical constraints was larger than life. Too bad this was an opportunity wasted.
I did like the portrayal of the king of England. He was endearing . It would be nice to think FDR did give him a father figure to relate to that helped his confidence. The wife, the queen:

5255770,3,B0093DFM8A,"On the cusp of going to war with Germany, King George (""Bertie"") and his Queen Elizabeth (Olivia Colman) become the first British royals to visit America.  The King (Samuel West), realizing that England may become toast at the hands of the emerging Nazi juggernaut, approaches President Franklin Roosevelt (a charming Bill Murray) to gain U. S. support, both financially and militarily.  Thus the stage is set at Roosevelt's getaway home, still owned by his aging mother (Elizabeth Wilson).

It should come as no surprise that the marriage between Franklin and Eleanor (Olivia Williams) is more of a business arrangement at this point.  Franklin had strayed many times including times with a married woman (never seen) as well as his secretary Missy (Elizabeth Marvel).  Looking for someone to help take Franklin's mind off matters of state, his mother would often call relatives to come and visit.  This time she contacts a 5th cousin, Daisy (Laura Linney) and requests a visit.  Franklin and Daisy quickly become close.  Very close.

While various dalliances are in play, Franklin and ""Bertie"" manage to hit it off to the point that the King even eats a hot dog at a planned picnic.  This is a headline maker that seems to equate the King of England with being just another guy.  The idea would seem to be an important element in drawing America into the war.

The affairs are not very titillating, outside Daisy masturbating Franklin in his car, and that's probably a good thing.  The problem is that this is all pretty boring stuff.  The best parts of the film are the exchanges between Franklin and ""Bertie.""  I will also point out that the sets and photography are very well done.  There are some terrific night scenes that are beautifully shot.  The designers did a great job acquiring vintage cars and interior set pieces.  It all seemed very authentic.  While not overly enthusiastic about the story, the film provides some insight into a brief period of American and British cooperation as well as a peek at Roosevelt's not so secret private life.

I thought the Blu ray transfer was excellent.  It comes at 1080p resolution and has an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  The detail is excellent, especially in the close ups.  Murray's Roosevelt has a blotchy scab over his left eyebrow that was never explained in the script, but is clearly visible. The fine audio track is in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and while it is purposely conservative, it is always clear and well balanced.  The filmmakers make good use of the music of the day which is well presented in the surround format.  Extras include a commentary by director Roger Michell and producer Kevin Loader, some deleted scenes and 2 short docs regarding the production, including some interviews.",1373328000,,2752,4.892008639308855

Roger Michell once again proves to be one of the worst directors working (Notting Hill,  Morning Glory, etc.) What is this man's obsession with shooting everything from behind?  Scene after scene in this movie shoots characters from behind. There must be something Freudian here.

Laura Linney is lifeless as Daisy. There is no chemistry between her and Bill Murray. I guess you can say Murray does OK, but he clearly pales in comparison to Daniel Day-Lewis as LIncoln. I wouldn't call this acting.

I think the central problem is that the only reason for Linney's character is that the memoir is based on her experience--I get that.

I did not find Bill Murray at all convincing in his portrayal( Freudian slip, I almost wrote betrayal) of FDR either.

5255782,4,B0093DFM8A,"{B+, maybe even A-}

Elegantly presented and gripping film about the relationship between FDR (Bill Murray) and his distant cousin Daisy (Laura Linney). This is more of an episodic slice-of-life than it is a rising action and climax (no pun intended) film. Still, HYDE PARK ON HUDSON does what it set out to do very well and succeeds in being lightheartedly funny, realistic, poignant, and many other things all at once.

The subplot concerning the visit of George VI and Queen Elizabeth (superbly played by Samuel West and Olivia Colman) is probably the best part of the entire film. Witnessing the Royalty's bedroom discussions of America and Americans (with special focus on the Roosevelts), I thought, ""That must be very close to how their talks actually went."" All four of the aforementioned actors are quite natural in their roles, and Olivia Williams's performance as Eleanor Roosevelt also deserves special mention. Williams captures Eleanor, physically homely but immensely sincere, remarkably well even though she looks a bit younger than Eleanor actually was/looked in 1939. Though it didn't bother me, I've also heard a number of complaints that FDR himself does not look that much like the real thing in this film. Otherwise, the general cinematography, scenery, and costume design are all painstakingly done and quite impressive. Many of the ""little things""--details of plot and setting, random incidents, etc--as well as the overall care that was obviously taken in producing HYDE PARK ON HUDSON, also contribute a great deal in making this film so compellingly real.

I haven't bothered to fact-check how historically accurate HPH is, and it's not something that really concerns me.

5255803,5,B0093DFM8A,"The Amazon editorial review gets it wrong, this movie is not about Franklin Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt hosting the king and queen of England at his mother's home. This movie is a narrative by FDR's 5th cousin Daisy, with some other historical tidbits like the King's visit filled in around her diary entries.

Lushly filmed in Great Britain, the movie looks and sounds great thanks to the stunning skill of director Roger Michell. Bill Murray is a surprise as he perfectly plays FDR in a manner that in no way reminds one of Ghostbusters, Stripes, or even last decade's Lost in Translation. His seduction of his 5th cousin Daisy is presented as beautifully as possible, but comes off creepy and regrettable. I was wishing Daisy would have slapped his glasses off his presidential face when he moved her hand to his thigh.

FDR used a variety of techniques to seduce various women he had his eye on. He sweeps them up a hillside (away from the police escort), to show them a view from a cottage that he had built ""just for them"". That a man of his age has nothing but sex on his mind is an amazing thing, but equally surprising is that each cast off mistress happily takes her turn in his inner circle and ""prepares"" the newest conquest for accepting her place when another conquest beckons.

If this all sounds very similar to Bill Clinton's pelvic shenanigans, you're not far off. The movie even has FDR comment at one point on how the press covers for him ranging from sex to polio, and he laments that he hopes this never changes. Of course, this never has changed, as both FDR and Clinton were Democrats, and thus above all law and moral consideration in all respects.

The question arises, would Daisy under any other circumstance have an intimate relationship with her elderly, disgusting 5th cousin, were he not president? Of course not! The movie does not shy away from this disconcerting aspect. The dirty laundry is all presented to the audience, for you to react as yourself. I found this a refreshing approach.

Murray's scenes with the king and queen of England are charming, as the movie often delights at the ""fish out of water"" notion of the royals over-reacting to the simple moves of their American cousins. But the movie also hints at the dangers of might makes right and why America should never consider the president a king of any sort. I never understood the hero worship of Democrat presidents who abused their office by using it to pursue as much tail as time permitted, whether it was JFK assaulting female journalists in the press pool (Mimi Alford being one), Ted Kennedy driving his chosen victim into a watery abyss, or Bill Clinton forcing himself on unwilling women in hotel rooms. Power corrupts, or these human jackasses were corrupt to begin with. I suspect the latter to be truest.

As the movie has given me cause for some reflection, I hope it does for other viewers in their own ways as well. This is one well-shot movie, cast and crew did a superb job.

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

 'Hyde Park on Hudson' reminded me a little of another indie film, 'My Weekend with Marilyn'. Both deal in limited moment in time 'behind-the scene' peeks in the life of iconic historical figures, told through the eyes of an interloper. In the latter case, it was Marilyn Monroe's short time on the set of the 1957 Lawrence Olivier film, 'Prince and the Show Girl', narrated by a young man, employed as a director's assistant. In 'Hyde Park', the setting is June 1939, when King George and Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother) pay a visit to President Roosevelt at his Hyde Park estate. This 'slice in time' is narrated by a distant cousin of FDR's, Margaret 'Daisy' Suckley, who ends up as one of the president's mistresses.

'Hyde Park' seeks to reveal the personal life of FDR as opposed to his political life. Bill Murray does a decent enough job as FDR and of course using Murray due to his star power, certainly didn't hurt the film at the box office. I wonder, on the other hand, if there could have been another actor out there who could have done an even better job, showing us what FDR was really like.

Probably one of the most interesting aspects of the film is the way the press took a 'hands off' policy towards FDR's polio handicap. It's a little shocking to see one of the president's assistants, carrying him into the house through a back door, after all the press and guests have walked in through the front door. But that's exactly the way it was.

There's not a great amount of drama per see in 'Hyde Park on Hudson'. The film mainly focuses on two concerns: the Royal visit and FDR's infidelities.

As for the Royal Visit, Queen Elizabeth almost comes off as the antagonist, as she whines about some old American political cartoons from the War of 1812 that FDR put up in their guest room. Apparently, the Queen did not care for the depiction of the British officers. Her inflexibility is apparent since of course the pictures are a little over 125 years old.

King George comes off as much more dignified. As in the recent Academy Award winner 'The Kings Speech', the King must deal with a stuttering problem. In perhaps the best scene in the film, he has a personal conversation with FDR who reassures him that his stuttering is not really noticeable (after all FDR must deal with a handicap fall worse than the King's). There is also reassurance coming from FDR, on America's support for Britain, at the eve of World War II.

The rest of 'Hyde Park' deals with FDR's various affairs. Laura Linney as Daisy makes it clear that Eleanor Roosevelt accepted FDR's liaisons with other women but their relationship was not at all strained. Unfortunately, in this film, we see little of Eleanor, who does not play a big role in the plot.

One scene that many critics didn't care for was when FDR ditches the Secret Service and has a moment of 'intimacy' with Daisy inside his car off a back road, out in the country (one critic humorously asserted that the film should have been called ""Hot dogs and Hand Jobs"", alluding to the aforementioned scene as well the scene at the end of the film, when King George finally owns up to liking the hot dogs that have been served to him during a picnic with the press in attendance).

Despite his polio, it's apparent that FDR had enough sexual sensation left that led him to indulge in various affairs with women. It was also a matter of companionship, given the pressure of the job he held. Nonetheless, the fact that FDR did have affairs is not all that interesting in the grand scheme of things. The big second act crisis is when Daisy finds out about FDR's other relationship with Marguerite LeHand. There's a blow-up but Daisy does eventually 'come around', and accepts the fact that the President must 'have' his women. Again, not very interesting stuff.

'Hyde Park on Hudson' is a breezy but narrow in scope peek at the FDR's personal life during one short moment in time. The time goes by rather quickly in watching this film, but you may find enough tidbits here that will satiate your appetite.",1370736000,3,4131,4.590230664857531

5255816,1,B0093DFM8A,"First of all, who gave Bill Murray the idea that he could act?? It's one thing to do Caddyshack, Ghost Busters, Stripes, etc but impersonating a statesman takes a bit of effort. Aside from jutting out his jaw, he doesn't have a clue of the FDR persona or voice. The effort is on the part of the viewers wading thru this badly-written and even worse directed movie. True, FDR had mistresses and George VI visited Hyde Park in 1939 but this poor effort makes a mish-mash of it all and drags along until it sputters to an end - and none too soon.",1370649600,9,543,4.281553398058253

5255821,2,B0093DFM8A,"It's 1939, and while FDR is preparing to host the King and Queen of England at his New York home, he makes time for a new mistress.

Bill Murray does a good job underplaying FDR, making him very cheerful and down-to-earth, while also a very bad husband.  Laura Linney plays Daisy, the mistress, and she's dishwater-dull and completely without appeal, but FDR, apparently, liked her a lot.  The royals are portrayed as dimwitted snobs who take great offense at having to attend a picnic and eat hot dogs.  Nothing much happens and then it's over.

The tone of the movie is unremittingly low-key and I waited, in vain, for something interesting to happen.  Although the King was there to enlist American support for WWII, the focus is on the dreary, mousy,  and quite clueless mistress.  It's inconsequential and only mildly entertaining.",1370563200,2,836,4.879432624113475

The movie only covers a brief part of FDR's history, but it's a part that I was not familiar with, nor, I surmise, are most people aware. It's the build up as WW II approaches, and the British (The King's Speech) comes calling hat in hand.
If your looking for war stories or fire side chats, this is not the movie for you, but if you enjoy great acting and learning about a period in our history that few know about, don't miss this movie. It all takes place at Hyde Park on Hudson. There are no Washington scenes.",1369612800,,707,4.446153846153846
5255848,5,B0093DFM8A,"FDR will always be remembered as the rock from which American's drew strength to pull themselves up by their boot-straps and overcome the devastating personal losses dealt them during the Great Depression and to then build our nation's tools of war so as to join and win the fight to preserve our freedoms and those of our allies threatened by Hitler and the Japanese - winning WW2 against insurmountable odds.  This film delivers a superb ""stage"" that replicates the time & place where FDR's personal relationships are played out congruently with the pressures of the political climate that he bore and collectively defined him as a man and beloved president.  The film depicts how the people and the press of that era chose not to sit in judgment and promote his physical limitations and rumors whispered of relationships outside his marriage: a marriage in which his wife could not endure the prospect of birthing more children - withdrawing her physical relationship with him and pursuing a lesbian relationship. She continued to be his legs and right arm - traveling throughout the country connecting with the people and gathering information on their plight. He loved her for that overlooked when her own political agenda went beyond his own;  and, lastly, the ever-present and unavoidable stresses of dealing with a controlling  mother whose love and financial support was a double-edged sword throughout his lifetime.
The film depicts how deeply he loved and cared for people. How non-judgmental he was of the personal short-comings of others and vocal in his support of their strengths. He was the voice of the masses and centered all his governing priorities on improving the circumstances of the common man. I was particularly taken with the portrayal of his ability to exude cheerfulness - to seek out the joy  - however small - found in living in the moment. He would not allow all the distractions of the dire circumstances pressed upon him and those he loved to take away a measure of happiness a sunny afternoon might present.  The county's strength was held together in great part by a desire to believe in his persona of moral-based values and strength of character, while choosing to place little stock in his state of  declining personal health.... because he chose to ignore it himself until the very end. History remembers him not for his personal weaknesses and physical limitations but as the most beloved president who saw the nation through the most trying of times and governed with grit and optimism and governing ""by and for the people"".",1369612800,,2566,4.967365967365968

5255855,3,B0093DFM8A,"I wanted to like this film more than I did. I appreciated that it showed FDR in the eye of the hurricane. He was the first president who dominated and was constrained by the modern media. Yet he was also a real man, still rooted in the old Dutch and English squirocracy of the Hudson Valley. The production design and cinematography effectively recreated the lived-in and fusty Roosevelt estate, which coexisted with the genteel poverty of Daisy and other poor relations.

My principal gripe is that Bill Murray did not adequately portray Franklin Roosevelt's unparalleled charm and charisma. Kenneth Branagh, in Warm Springs, better captured the man's drive and ability to understand and inspire people.  Murray had too much of the underplayed darkness that enhanced Broken Flowers and Lost in Translation. This qualify worked well when showing the indignities of paralysis that wealth and power can ease but not eliminate. Murray also conveyed the Roosevelt with the perception and intelligence to understand the chaos unleashed by his need to have his, let's say, ego stroked by many women, but with the selfishness and entitlement to indulge himself.",1369526400,,1154,5.165775401069519

5255878,3,B0093DFM8A,"Hyde Park on Hudson is a film purportedly about the visit of King George VI and Queen Mary to Hyde Park in the summer of 1939 just before the beginning of World War II. And, to be sure, there are scenes involving the visit, the needs for both sides in planning and presenting the visit, and on the importance of the King eating hot dogs at a picnic planned for the occasion. George and Mary are presented as insecure and, she in particular, looking for slights. But the real focus of the film is on the relationship between the President played by Bill Murray and his various women, including the newest recruit, Daisy Stuckley, a fifth or sixth cousin, played by Laura Linney. How much of this accords with historical accuracy may be a matter for debate as the film takes for granted the existence of lesbian relationships for Eleanor, multiple associations by FDR, and a complicity of aides appropriate to an Oriental potentate.
 FDRs women, per the film, are better characterized as concubines seriatim rather than anything else and they all become friends and mutually support each other in their task of relieving the tension of the Great Man. This is all played deftly and with a certain amount of skill. Linney in particular manages to wring a lot of sympathy for a women who had to have been in her late forties when this liaison began and Missy Le Hand had been at it for several years. Some historians were appalled at the liberties taken with the film.
 Nevertheless, much of the personalities displayed accords with what we know about FDR. Although not looking much like FDR, Murray plays him brilliantly in his capacity to thwart his minders, his mother, his importuners, and anyone else who gets in the way of his plans or promotions. You get a sense of the ability of this lonely man to sum up his associates with uncanny accuracy and to know just how far they can be trusted or pushed. He also demonstrates the ruthlessness with which he discards people who are no longer of any use to him; Le Hands years in the hospital never elicited one visit from FDR who found that sickness depressed him.
This is not a great film, or one with any particular insight into world politics or even human understanding, but it is a great depiction of a master politician managing his household just as he managed a nationwith an uncanny devotion to ensuring that all lines ran directly back to him and not through an emissary unless of FDRs choosing. I don't think FDR would have made a good friend, but he certainly made a good leader for this various times. I do wonder if he had as much introspective acuity as the film makes out, but we will never know because he never revealed anything directly. We will always see him through the eyes of others. The great biography of FDR remains yet to be written; Caro has LBJ and MacCullogh has Truman, but the biographers of FDR tend to be either by sycophants or adversaries. Even 70 years later, he is an enigma wrapped up in a riddle encased in a mystery, to paraphrase Churchill.",1368921600,4,3029,4.586715867158672

Bill Murray offers a surprisingly subdued FDR that works in the private context. Laura Linney does a fine job as the mousy and adoring Suckley though there are times when her character seems a little too passive (though based on Geoffrey Ward's ""Closest Companion"" which looks at Suckley and FDR that's not exactly off the mark). Samuel West and Olivia Colman do well as King George VI and Queen Elizabeth--no mean feat after ""The King's Speech."" While there is some lovely scenery and a charming score by Jeremy Sams, at times the film drags.

Murray is, of  course, a master of dead pan comedy.  But his attempts at drama illustrate his inability to portray a full range of human emotions.  In this instance he fails to provide the character of FDR with the overwhelming charm and charisma which was the key to the development of the many relationships portrayed here.  However, Laura Linney, one of America's best dramatic actresses, saves this film, providing her character with many subtle nuances that enrich the story.

The movie showed the FDR and the king became very friendly after this, but it was a full two years before the US joined the war. Even then it wasn't until after we were attacked. So, it seems there is this great build up for nothing.

Everything is based on the diaries of a cousin/lover, but the cousin wasn't present during much of the action. The story also shows very little of their relationship.

Bill Murray plays a believable role as FDR but unfortunately that's the highlight of the movie. A story that seems to go no where and have very little substance or storyline. I was extremely disappointed in the lack of a movie here other than with the revelation that FDR had a relationship with many women at the same time. Whether that is true or not, the producers found a way to make it the most boring biopic I have ever seen.

It's always hard to know in biopic's what's reality and what's the director's imagination, but in this case the picture that is painted is highly interesting and engaging, historical accuracy and faithfulness questions aside. Murray depicts FDR as a very human larger-than-life figure brought into sharp focus during the bits where an assistant carries him from place to place. This could be enormously humiliating for the average Joe, but Murray succeeds in capturing a whole host of reactions to this necessary inconvenience on the part of FDR: there is a whiff of humiliation (but just a whiff), more amusement, a good bit of lordliness and almost smugness. Really well done. There are a lot of remarkable aspects to the story depicted here, not the least of which is that the subject of FDR's physical restrictions are almost never dealt with directly although they are always present. It's almost as if his physical disability is a minor intrusion or inconvenience more than a life altering challenge. His very full life is awe-inspiring; his physical limitations did not stop him from achieving remarkable things, and although not at all the focus of the film, this reality gives one pause when pondering the meaning of the word ""disability.""

5255919,5,B0093DFM8A,"This is an unusual and remarkably private view of the life of FDR (Bill Murray). It is told mostly in first person from the view of Daisy (Laura Linney) his distant cousin and mistress. This story is based on her private letters and diaries discovered after her death. We have no reason to doubt them. As such the story is as much about her as it is FDR, a complex man whose multiple sides are now revealed to everyone. He was a nice philanderer.

The main point of plot interest is when the King and Queen of England come to America. England was headed for war with Germany and will desperately need our assistance. (Plot spoiler: We help the UK and win.) However they visit at a time when the President has mistress issues. They see him having to be carried from location to location. FDR has a way of charming, but at the same time humbling the monarchy. King Edward (Samuel West) was indeed remarkable and likeable.

There were several scenes I would stop and think. There is irony intricately laced within the dialouge of the scenes. I would find myself laughing at scenes after they had ended and I contemplated them for a moment.

The film whispers of old long debates of government vs. private sector, but stops short of making any overt statements. This is not your momma's fireside FDR.

It is a fascinating film for history buffs, and a bit of a chick film drama. I love how this film was intellectually crafted. Not for everyone. Laura Linney and Olivia Coleman (Queen Elizabeth) are Oscar nomination worthy.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs or nudity. There is a brief ""hand gratification"" early in the film.",1368057600,,1616,4.616724738675958
5255920,2,B0093DFM8A,"I always enjoy a good historical drama and had high hopes for this movie. Let me just start out by saying that Bill Murray does an admirable job as FDR. Unfortunately, he was given a very poor script to work with and not even Murray or the superb Laura Linney can save this film. The apparent plot of the movie is that in 1939, FDR summons a distant cousin Daisy (Linney) to his New York country home. Why? Well, we're never exactly sure, but Daisy becomes a confidant and apparently, a lover. In the meantime, they prepare for and host the king and queen of England. Now all of this should make for a good movie, but honestly, the biggest part of this movie deals with whether or not the king will eat a hot dog at the picnic they have planned. I'm not kidding - this takes up a huge amount of the movie. And at 2 hours, this thing plods along like an old basset hound. There is ultimately no plot resolution to speak of and at the end of the movie, you want that 2 hours back in your life.",1367971200,,991,4.139896373056994
5255921,3,B0093DFM8A,"The story of Daisy' s infatuation with the man holding the most powerful position in America only held my interest because  it told of the bond made between the US and England at a crucial time in the world when friendship was a conduit for trust between wartime leadership. Great scenery and authentic set and costumes. If this was meant to portrait a love affair, I only saw a young naive woman fulfilling the sexual appetite of the kind President. Sad but true.",1367798400,,464,4.590361445783133
5255922,4,B0093DFM8A,Headline says it all.  I was somewhat intrigued after doing some earlier reading about FDR.  This was a nice supplement.,1367798400,,120,4.95
5255923,5,B0093DFM8A,I loved see the events surrounding the royal couple.  They were such an interesting royal couple.  Like to see some aspects of Roosevelts personality but did not like to learn about his many lovers.,1367712000,,198,4.794117647058823
5255924,5,B0093DFM8A,"The strength of this movie to me is the very personal look at all the characters and the revealing ways they are portrayed. We see FDR, Eleanor, the King and Queen of England as people, and the way their personal strengths and foibles played a part in history. The inner, personal stories and outer, historic selves work together to give this film a fresh perspective. I loved hearing what the King and Queen talked about in their bedroom, seeing Roosevelt's finesse at politicking and wooing both, learning the details of the domestic arrangements for historic affairs. The script was witty and moving, the acting spot on. If you've enjoyed such films as The Queen, The Gathering Storm, or Enchanted April, I think there's a very good chance you'll love this.

5255926,4,B0093DFM8A,"I had to do a lot of fact checking to believe that there was this much hankey panky going on behind the scenes with FDR, but it seems to be historically sound in it's portrayal.  The acting was superb and it was artistically well done  Enoyede it much more than I thought I would.

5255927,4,B0093DFM8A,Bill Murray is a great FDR. The movie serves as a minor sequel to The King's Speech. Not so much about political but rather romantic intrigue.,1367625600,,142,4.5
5255928,3,B0093DFM8A,"There is some storyline devoted to the fling between FDR and his cousin, but much of the story has to do with the king and queen of England and their visit to his home.  This makes it almost seem like two movies instead of one.  However, the actors all do nice work in their roles, especially Bill Murray.",1367625600,,305,4.241379310344827

5255930,3,B0093DFM8A,Focuses on Roosevelt as chief rooster with a flock of docile ladies in his Harem on Hudson. Bill Murray does not project the magnetism necessary to this role. Laura Linney has never impressed me much as an actress. She seems eternally syrupy. The British royal couple steal the show  with the expected wry Brit humor.,1367625600,,317,4.763636363636364

5255934,3,B0093DFM8A,Watched it on the Kindle Fire and a half a dozen times the picture would blur.  Have downloaded other movies with no problems.  Fire was fully charged.  Hard to see the dark scenes as the glass reflects cabin light in the plane...Movie was interesting.  wondered how much of it was true.,1367539200,,287,4.568627450980392
5255935,2,B0093DFM8A,"Historical films have been all the rage lately (Lincoln, Argo, J. Edgar, The Iron Lady, etc.) and it's not that history films aren't exciting- but let's be honest here:  sometimes they really aren't all that exciting.  It goes without saying that we go to the movies to be entertained, but there's just something unsettling about paying to see films based on true stories, even though that story is twisted around in order to look good for entertainment purposes.  For instance, Titanic - love story aside - got the historical portions of the film correct, making for an all-around wonderful movie experience.  On the other hand, films like Pearl Harbor and The Patriot have the absolute opposite impact and are filled with fictitious events that have the ability to paint the wrong picture of historical events.  Making a film about questionable or even possibly fictitious events is dirty business, which also happens to be the case with Hyde Park on Hudson.

Taking place in June 1939, Hyde Park on Hudson tells the true story of President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Bill Murray) hosting King George VI (Samuel West) and Queen Elizabeth (Olivia Colman) as they visit America in an attempt to get the United States to aid England during World War II.  It also focuses on the personal and intimate relationship between President Roosevelt and his distant cousin, Margaret Suckley (Laura Linney).  Olivia Williams and Elizabeth Marvel also star in supporting roles.

As far as a biographical film goes, Hyde Park on Hudson tells an interesting story that people might not know as it pertains to the relationship between the United States and England in 1939.  Indeed, the relationship was still strained from the wars that these two countries had had with one another, so it makes for some interesting, dramatic, and awkward moments between these two nation's leaders.  At the same time, it's a film that is difficult to care about in the sense that you never get to fully grasp the urgency during this particular time in history.  England badly needed the help of the United States, yet this film is nothing more than a glorified dinner party with FDR, his wife, the King and Queen of England, and - oh yeah, a handful of FDR's mistresses.

Supposedly, you're to believe that FDR had an intimate relationship with Margaret Suckley, even though you never actually see them being intimate.  Bill Murray and Laura Linney are both exquisite actors, but they never seem to click together in this film.  At certain points, it feels as though these two characters aren't even in the same movie, let alone in each other's lives.  However, Murray really does a superb job of portraying the great FDR, but for a film that is meant to devote half of its energy on a relationship between FDR and Suckley, it just doesn't seem authentic - not to mention it's quite possible that their intimate relationship is historically fictitious.  The jury is still out on that one.  Regardless, its very apparent that FDR, JFK, and Bill Clinton had a lot in common as it pertains to their personal lives.

Overall, the story was a good idea to tell - but is done with poor execution.  The characters are too bubbly, often times stuck up and hard to relate to or care about.  And, since caring about characters is essential to a film's success, it's hard to call this film anything other than a failed production.

If you want information about the suposed love FDR, read a book instead.

5255937,1,B0093DFM8A,"How very disappointing! Bill Murray and Laura Linney seem to be embarrassed by the script and what were the producers thinking when they felt you could do another movie with King George and his wife after the success of The King's Speech?

It seemed to be about one thing, the royal visit, but in the end it was about something completely different. I would have rather it be strictly about the royal visit or that other story line, but not both. We all know that Presidents have certain proclivities but do we really need to see them on the silver screen, do we really need to be witness to the dirtying of a President's laundry.

Explains his relationship with Eleanor, and clears up rumors of his daliences with his secretary(s).  I feel that the visit from the King of England to ask for military support was almost created for a little more color.  It meshed beautifully into the storyline.  This movie shows you the boy inside the man, and how that wise boy could kindly bring out the best in others when they felt awkward in his presence.  He may have had a weakness for women, but FDR also had a gift when it came to understanding people's needs.  Not only entertaining, this movie is also profound.",1367452800,,734,4.651162790697675

The portrayal of FDR by Bill Murray was just unrealistic and underwhelming. Sure, we have a biased perception of FDR as a towering wartime leader and skillful politician. What I didn't like was the portrayal as a manipulative womanizer, using woman for comfort and expecting that they would be loyal and discreet. The royals having hot dogs at a barbecue was only a minor sub-plot.

Moreover, I just thought the plot was unrealistic and the acting was stilted.

5255962,4,B0093DFM8A,"Isn't interesting when we discover that some of our POTUS's have had multiple extra-marital affairs that Hollywood chooses to sublimely package the details as somehow acceptable? Be that as it may, whether this is revisionist history or based in truth, Hyde Park on Hudson is entertaining, engaging and very well trouped. Murray and Linney perform well together with their duet chemistry tending more toward the basic side of an acting pH scale. West and Coleman are understated as the King & Queen; kudos to Ellen Lewis/Gail Stevens for their casting choices. Some of the best scenes involve the interplay between Franklin and Bertie as they get to know each other and form a bond that was a proactive prescription for Allied victory in WWII. Somewhat disguised is the sub theme that handicapped individuals have the same basic needs as everyone; be they companionship, respect, inclusion or sexual gratification. Murray plays that theme out expertly and it is woven so tightly into the fabric of the film we scarcely take notice. Bravo Bill. As a period piece of cinema the production is extraordinary in the set, prop, costume and location departments. Much due diligence was executed for exact replication of everything of that time. Viewers will be illuminated to a part of history they may not have explored before. This film is a solid 4 stars out of 5, see it for what it really is: a painted portrait of the human side of some people we have heard of before and we loved them because, in the finally analysis, they were just like us.",1367020800,,1542,4.84469696969697

5255966,5,B0093DFM8A,"It's kind of fun to see a famous U.S. president who was, actually, such a naughty boy. In the late 1930's, and for the very first time, a European sovereign and her majesty travel to the United States to visit the president. The King and Queen travel to the Hudson Valley, upper New York state, and get ready for a weekend country picnic. This little party will feature the new American ""hot dog"" with mustard, and Indians playing Tom-Tom's. At the same time, President Roosevelt(Bill Murray) begins an affair with his cousin, Daisy(Laura Linney). Daisy doesn't know that there is more than one hen in the hen-house; the president has multiple lovers(and a wife). Before the picnic, FDR assembles a royal group in the drawing room. FDR's mother bursts in: ""You can't serve drinks to the King and Queen"" she shouts. FDR's mother had an alcoholic father and husband. A lively shouting match follows, and FDR proclaims that ""We will have drinks. After all, I'm the president...""British director Roger Michell's tasteful, controlled, yet leisurely non-epic is a classy look at a famous American president(from behind closed doors).  ""Hyde Park"" was shot 45 miles from Piccadilly Square, England, a certainly distant location substitution. It works. Chain-smoking and invading a hidden silver flask with abandon, Bill Murray is excellent as FDR. Two-or-three good roles in-a-row have rejuvenated the career of our one-time Hollywood bad-boy. DVD extras include six trailers, a commentary, and two featurettes. Shot mostly on video, the colors are muted, but I haven't seen the BlueRay. Here is the Queen and Bertie, or King George VI. In 2010, Colin Firth won the Academy Award for playing King George VI, in ""The King's Speech"".

5255985,4,B0093DFM8A,"The directorial angle this film adopts is evident from the initial scenes. Obviously, it's a story that cannot be properly shared without an invasion of privacy, thus a candid emotional intimacy. HPoHudson is a novel on stilts, so, each new idea is played out with a patience, color and subtlety common to reality and the written word.

Although the cinematography is good, giving us landscapes, discomfiting close-ups and descriptive shots gorgeous enough to be consumed as overpriced watercolors, it is the relationship between FDR and his distant cousin that pulls us along --which leads me to assert that the acting is also very good. Laura Linney, as usual, plays sweet, pained and transparent Daisy with such an ease we forget we've seen her do it before. Bill Murray's excessively jovial flawed father figure is slightly less believable, but only because the portrayal is of FDR. His actual performance is seamless.

The disappointment expressed by other reviewers is understandable. My advice? Don't trust the trailer. This movie is well put together, boasting a solid score, intriguing characters, lively action and a historical connection with a highly theatrical draw, but there are three side stories swirling around the two mugs they put on the box and the posters. The central story disappoints.

If you watch this film, enjoy the beauty created from the story boards and shot in nature, the accurate wardrobe. Follow the excellent characterization of Elizabeth and Bertie, played 'smashingly' by Samuel West and Olivia Coleman. Let your mind dance around the possible truths and bigger myths of our former first lady, Eleanor.

If you watch this film, remember it's a period piece, a high-spirited, languid, misty, filtered, contradictory memoire.

HPoHudson was carefully crafted by those participating mystical movie mavens. Even the 'mistakes' that make it less appealing to its desired audience were puposeful. It is a work of art and... Meh... I liked it.",1366675200,4,1975,5.257142857142857

5255999,1,B0093DFM8A,"I want to thank the producers of this god-awful film for sending me running to Geoffrey Ward's ""Closest Companion,"" the edited version of Daisy Suckley's diaries and the Suckley-Roosevelt correspondence that tells the real story of their special friendship.  Having read many accounts of the Roosevelt administration and New Deal, including bios of FDR (Kearns Goodwin, Smith) and Eleanor (Wieson Cook), I was looking forward to ""Hyde Park on the Hudson""  I admire Murray and Linney, whose talents are wasted on this turgid, maudlin soap opera that takes heaps and heaps of liberties with history, distorting the characters of all concerned -- Suckley, FDR, Eleanor and the Royals -- and depicting and conflicts that almost certainly did not -- as certain as we can be w/o having been there, which these producers most assuredly were not -- occur.

Suckley was an upper-crust Hudson Valley lady, a sixth cousin of FDR, who become his devoted companion and best friend.  Although they had some kind of intimate moment once, on a hill that became the site of Top Cottage, Daisy's comments about sex (she rarely kissed him, even affectionately) and proper behavior, and general naivete, are clear throughout the text.  While the film suggests that Suckley shared FDR, sexually, with Missy LeHand, his secretary, her diaries and their correspondence reveal only an ongoing very close friendship in which, as Suckley says, she and another cousin, Laura Delano acted first as companions -- Eleanor was nowhere to be seen -- and finally as loving caregivers to an increasingly frail Roosevelt, whom Suckley clearly worshipped. Suckley's diaries and the FDR/Suckley letters tell a fascinating ""insiders"" tale, not of sexual adventures, but rather of the Roosevelt administration during the late 1930s and WWII and life among the wealthy during that period.  We read about the drafting of the Atlantic Charter and Roosevelt's meetings with Churchill and Stalin -- from Roosevelt's uncensored point of view -- and learn Suckley's impressions and FDR's views regarding the members of his administration and many foreign leaders.  The passages on Churchill are wonderful, providing a close-up account of that great statesman and casting additional light on his relationship with FDR.

The reduction of the complex, loving friendship between two remarkable people to a soap opera in which Suckley is portrayed as mentally screaming ""You bastard!"" at a cheating Roosevelt, having sexual relations of a sort with him in his car and playing cards with Missy LeHand, is Hollywood at its most callow, silly and pitiable. Also unintentionally funny  -- although my spouse, a history major, was too outraged to laugh; he kept shouting ""What! What!  This is outrageous!"" while I tittered.

In short, read the Ward book.  You will come to love Daisy and to appreciate her devotion to FDR.  You will also learn a lot about history, from the inside.  If you want to watch a film about Roosevelt, rent or buy the PBS documentary, ""FDR.""

Not in a million years was the character played by the Queen remotely believable - a sort of demented neglected housewives of Belgravia, London  attempt.  And the way the women in his life were depicted as throwing themselves on Bill Murray required an enormous leap of imagination and disbelief.  Right down to the dowdy country house and furnishings, and the strangely disembodied biographical slant.  There was really nothing in the movie to commend it.
I do however not mean to impune the acting talents of individuals - which I am not trying to do.

5256034,3,B0093DFM8A,"""Hyde Park on Hudson""  stars Bill Murray as Frankin D.Roosevelt and takes place during a summer weekend in 1939 at his Hudson Valley estate when he hosted England's King George VI (Samuel West), who hoped to gain America's support in the coming war.  At the same time, according to the film, Roosevelt was pursuing an extramarital affair with a distant cousin, Daisy Suckley (Laura Linney).

Richard Nelson's script portrays Roosevelt as both a master of political gamesmanship and a manipulator of the women around him -- wife Eleanor (Olivia Williams), Daisy, and his private secretary, Missy (Elizabeth Marvel).  Murray, who might not seem a first choice to portray Roosevelt, conveys both the President's charm and a dark side rarely seen in public. His Roosevelt is surely the ideal host, going out of his way to make his guests feel comfortable, happy, and welcome.

The film has a voyeuristic quality, with the audience as willing spectators checking out a Roosevelt who balances work and play while under enormous pressures from both his public responsibilities and private peccadilloes.  It bogs down somewhat in a soap-opera subplot about Daisy discovering that she is only one in a long line of the President's lovers but, overall, the picture has a light touch and moves along briskly.

5256035,5,B0093DFM8A,"Two noticeable aspects on this site - the paucity of reviews of this period piece film and the number of negative comments that seem to blanket the responses to this very quiet little recreation of a moment in history about which few may be aware. In many ways this film, as written by Richard Nelson and directed by Roger Michell, resembles a little European art film: the recreation of conditions in the USA in the post Depression era are remarkably apt and set a fine tenor for the story (including the musical score!). In the end this is a tale about how men in powerful places interrelate in moments of tension and how those same men have flaws both physical and in character that would weigh down ordinary fellows. But the story is about a particular summer in when Britain, on the brink of war with Hitler, visited America, hoping for Allied assistance in the war that was to become World War II.

The setting is the home away form the White House - Hyde Park on the Hudson, the home of FDR's mother (Elizabeth Wilson) who still ruled the roost despite her son's political role. FDR is enchantingly portrayed by Bill Murray who is able to show all sides of FDR's personality - his response to being a victim of polio, his wisdom at running a country beaten down by the Depression, and his need for multiple liaisons with women. In one household we meet Missy (Elizabeth Marvel) who has been both secretary and lover of some time, Daisy (Laura Linney) who is FDR's fifth cousin who enters the coterie because of her honesty and genuine affection for FDR, and we hear about `Mrs Rutherford', yet another of FDR's affairs, and of course there is the presence of Eleanor Roosevelt (a superb Olivia Williams). Though the film seems to want to emphasize the development and course of FDR's affair with Daisy, the story gratefully focuses on the visit from The King and Queen of England - a first: Bertie (Samuel West) stutters his way into the favor of FDR while Elizabeth (Olivia Colman) tolerates her King-husband's lack of social graces and holds a lifted nose to the crude Americans. The highlight of the film is a glorious scene of a conversation between Bertie and FDR regarding their personal physical embarrassments and their joint worldviews. In the end there is a picnic where all comes to resolution.

For this viewer the portrayal by Bill Murray was a revelation for this actor. His version of FDR is a fine blend of humor, vulnerability, pride overcoming his need to be carried everywhere because of his paralysis, and his genuine sense of kindness and caring for his people. If his flaw was promiscuity, given the times and the presence of the powerful and stand-alone wife, it is a minor one. Laura Linney's Daisy is somewhat of a frump, kind and sensitive but clumsy, and has little to do except voice-over narration. But the rest of the cast is superb.  This is a film that deserves a much wider audience than it has received. Grady Harp, April 13",1365552000,55,2965,4.654580152671755
5256036,3,B0093DFM8A,"IMHO this film would have been so much better if it had stuck to the royal visit of George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the parents of current queen Elizabeth II, with FDR, on the eve of World War II. This story is of historic interest and has a positive ending in that FDR agreed to the support that the UK was hoping to obtain for the coming war. Feeling in the U.S. was strongly against involvement in another European war. FDR had the task of changing public opinion. He began by setting up the lend lease program to help with supplies, which he explained to U.S. citizenry as lending a garden hose to a neighbor with a burning house to prevent the fire from spreading to your house. Little is shown of this interesting story in the movie, but the meeting between the English King and FDR stands out and is, IMHO, the most successful scene in the movie.

By concentrating on FDR's romance with his distant cousin Margaret ""Daisy"" Suckley, the film shortchanged both stories: the romance and the royal visit. IMHO the romance was the weaker story-line of the two. Yet another film about the many dalliances of a man in a high position, which actually managed to make the seduction of a vulnerable person like Daisy rather boring and sad.

Samuel West does well as George VI and Bill Murray is magical, at times, as FDR. Laura Linney seems wasted in the role of FDR's naive love interest. The other actors seem competent in their roles. Performances are handicapped by the unfocused script.

A better script, with more direction, focusing on the royal visit and the plans for and the stakes of the coming war could have resulted in an important and engaging film that could have been a companion piece for ""The King's Speech"". The movie succeeds in one shining moment but falls far short most of the time.",1365465600,2,1802,4.572755417956657
5256037,4,B0093DFM8A,"The criticism of this film misses its central point--the parallelism between the way FDR conducted his personal affairs with the way he conducted his Presidency, especially his foreign policy. This movie depicts two seductions--FDR's seduction of his cousin Daisy and FDR's seduction of the King of England. In both situations, he risks rejection and establishes who is boss. He humiliates Daisy and also the King (with the hot dog at the picnic)--yet he also ennobles them and wins them to his side. He does it with personality and also by showing his mastery of his own physical handicaps. No matter his flaws, his ""allies"" remain loyal and ultimately subservient. I don't necessarily praise this, as much as note that the film is an attempt to display his strength of personality.  That said, there is no historical support other than speculation about any type of affair between FDR and Daisy. More than likely, she was one of his enablers--hence, her presence when he died at Warm Springs in the company of Lucy Mercer Rutherford.  Nonetheless, the historical license is not out of bounds--the evidence shows that FDR showed the same pattern of relationship with Eleanor, Lucy Mercer, and Missy LeHand. Ultimately, he would have the same relationship with Winston Churchill--he would seduce him as an ally and then turn him into a subservient ""third world partner"" in order to appease Joseph Stalin (a man with an equally ruthless personality). IN short, the movie is a provocative look at the similarities between the exericise of personal and political power. It should get credit for taking an intriguing twist on FDR's life and career.",1365465600,7,1644,5.062730627306273

5256040,2,B0093DFM8A,"Franklin Delano Roosevelt has been portrayed by many actors in productions of many kinds. Ralph Bellamy (on stage, in film, and on television), Edward Herrmann (on television and in a Hollywood musical), Ralph Vaughn, Jon Voight, David Ogden Stiers, and Kenneth Branagh have each brought their own skills to bear in interpreting this complex man - a figure at once tangible and elusive.

Of course, many films have dealt with historical figures and or situations. Some have used historical events as backgrounds for a fictional story, usually Romantic - such as Titanic and Pearl Harbor. In those cases, real-life figures are relegated to supporting roles. Others have placed the historical figure dead center in the production - dead usually being the operative word. Too often, historical biographies are like animated wax museums: the Important Events in a lifetime are recreated in the span of a few hours with little insight given into the person's character, into what drove these flesh and blood people. The miniseries on John Adams is the finest example I've seen - the seven hour running time gave the writers and producers adequate time to flesh out the characters.

Sadly such is not the case with Hyde Park on Hudson, which is neither a biographical film nor a historical melodrama. HPoH isn't merely the weakest film I've ever seen on FDR, it's the worst film on a U. S. President I've ever seen, period. How bad is HPoH? Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter, and FDR American Badass - neither of which was intended to be taken seriously - are masterpieces by comparison.

Whether a play, TV show, or film: if it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage. With a strong script, nearly any production's flaws can be overlooked. When the script is weak, ""all the kings horses and all the kings men..."" - and the screenplay for HPoH is God-awful. It makes no attempt at a dramatic through-line, with no sense of a beginning or ending, nor character development. Indeed, the characters are two-dimensional and, frankly, uninteresting. Then there are the ""liberties"" taken with history.

There is so much outright falsehood that it's hard to know where to begin. But let's start at a central plot element, the film's portrayal of FDR's ""affair"" with distant cousin Margaret ""Daisy"" Suckley. A typical scene has FDR driving Daisy in his manually controlled Ford, waving off the Secret Service, and then parking with Daisy in a field - whereupon she provides her own ""manual"" service to the President.

FDR was no plaster saint, he had a multitude of character defects: devious, manipulative, and ruthless. FDR was also an unfaithful husband. He had an affair with Lucy Mercer and more than likely with Marguerite ""Missy"" LeHand. Both Lucy and Daisy were with FDR in Warm Springs when was stricken by a fatal stroke - Missy had died the previous year. (The idea that Lucy and Daisy both had affairs with FDR and then spent time together as if they were aging sorority sisters boggles the mind.) HPoH's portrayal of Daisy's relationship with FDR as anything more than a friendship between a magnetic, complicated man and his spinster, sixth cousin is not only fanciful, it's defamatory. HPoH bears no resemblance to Daisy's diaries of their time together, which were published after her death in 1991. If there was any special aspect to FDR's relationship with Daisy, it's that he revealed more of himself emotionally than he did with the rest of his circle - it was to Daisy alone than he confided what a burden the Presidency was becoming to him, how much he wanted to retire, and his worries about his health. His trust in Daisy was such that two of the very rare photographs of FDR in a wheelchair were taken by her. There were dozens of women, and not a few men, whose lives revolved around doting on FDR. There was a certain effervescence about him that made people want to spend time with him. Indeed, Winston Churchill wrote that meeting FDR was ""like opening your first bottle of champagne"". Adoration does not necessarily equal sexual conjugation.

I would also add that Daisy was nowhere near as attractive as Laura Linney, an actress I have to feel sorry for after seeing HPoH. I've followed Linney's career with interest since she first appeared as Mary Ann Singleton in Tales of the City back in 1993. More recently, she did a compelling star turn as Abigail Adams. But here she has little to do but hide behind a veil of demure coyness. If Linney's agent recommended this movie for her, he should be fired.

Bill Murray neither looks nor sounds like FDR. Worse, he makes little effort to look or sound like him, from the way he wears his pince-nez, to the angle of his cigarette holder, to the timbre and accent of his voice.  Nor is Murray able to recreate the halting walk FDR taught himself after becoming paralyzed in 1921. (The only actor I've seen recreate FDR's walk convincingly is Edward Herrmann.) The man whose crippled legs were masked by the determination and iron will that allowed him to guide America through the Great Depression and World War II is nowhere to be seen here. As portrayed by Murray, FDR is merely a cocktail swilling, dilettante and bon-vivant who happens to be President of the United States - when he's not too busy soliciting ""favors"" from the women in his life. I have to wonder whether Murray has read even one of the many biographies about FDR before taking this role.

Olivia Williams is entirely miscast as Eleanor Roosevelt. Nothing of the real vitality that attracted Franklin to her is here (shortly before his death, FDR told his son that even after 40 years of marriage, Eleanor was still ""the most fascinating woman"" he'd ever met), only hints that she sought companionship from other women. Nor is the passion for social justice that fueled Eleanor from her adolescence until her death. Here, she's merely an irritatable quasi new-age ditz.

Not everything about HPoH is completely terrible.  Samuel West and Olivia Colman turn in excellent, perfectly timed, performances as England's King and Queen. Elizabeth Wilson is fine as FDR's mother, although why she uses a slightly foreign accent when the real Sara Delano Roosevelt was born in New York is puzzling to me.  The propmaster does an excellent job recreating the look of 1939.

But HPoH suffers from a split personality: for the most part, it's a comedic culture clash about the British Royals' visit to America; then it becomes a clumsy, angsty drama about a philandering President's multiple affairs.  The latter plotline could have been entirely dropped and the film would have been much stronger.

The exterior of Springwood looks nothing like the real thing (I've been there). I can certainly understand why the Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park would decline to allow this tripe to be filmed on location, but couldn't the filmmakers have created a CGI version?

In short, Hyde Park on Hudson is not historically accurate. Worse to some, it's not entertaining - not even as a low-sex comedy, as it's too slow moving. The writer, the producers, and Murray himself should be embarrassed they ever committed to this project.",1365379200,7,7136,4.856085526315789
5256041,3,B0093DFM8A,"While I appreciate the expertise &  execution of Mr. Solinas  skilled review in his assessment viewing  Hyde Park on Hudson  as a boring biopic, ..... as one  who was not alive during his administration, I appreciate the intimate  ""fly on the wall"" look  at one of this nation's (and the worlds) most iconic leaders - his strengths, fears, and foibles as the world approached its second world war. I can't help believe that most people would jump at an opportunity to witness or learn what it was like for those involved  and what was going on behind closed doors at such a fateful time.  The movie was supposedly based upon a book written by a distant cousin who came to assist him during those difficult times - only to become the latest object of his affections.  It strips away the veneer that historic figures attain and shows such leaders are real people too  -  not iconic cartoonish live action figurines.  They are subject to same physical & emotional challenges, desires, fears,  and inadequacies we all possess. Some of us achieve greatness, become leaders, and are viewed as heroes by some and the evil incarnate by others.  We all try to envision what it was like to be such a person. In this peak behind the curtains we realize we were almost staring at our own reflection....not only our failings-- but more importantly -- our innate possibilities.",1365206400,12,1363,4.716101694915254
5256042,3,B0093DFM8A,"Hyde Park On Hudson is something of a problematic film, an uneven mix of some excellent performances and cinematography dragged down by a schizoid screenplay that can't seem to make up its mind which of two stories it's trying to tell: Margaret ""Daisy"" Suckley's long-term relationship with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt as his mistress (or one of them, anyway), or the historic visit of King George VI to meet with FDR on the eve of WWII, the first time a reigning British monarch had ever visited the US. Either would've made an interesting story, but in Hyde Park On Hudson, they end up working at cross purposes, leaving the whole disappointingly less than of the sum of its parts.

The film begins in the early 1930's when Daisy (Laura Linney) is unexpectedly summoned by FDR's formidable mother, Sara (Elizabeth Wilson) to their home, Springwood, in Hyde Park, New York, to be a personal assistant to Franklin (Bill Murray in a truly remarkable performance). Daisy, a spinster in her early 40's who lives with her aunt and a distant (sixth cousin) relative of FDR's goes, though she has no idea of why Franklin would ask for her as she hasn't seen him in years or what her duties would involve. She soon finds out however as Franklin first charms and then later seduces her into becoming his mistress.

Things then fast-forward to June of 1939, when the King and Queen of the United Kingdom, George VI (Samuel West) and his wife Elizabeth (Olivia Colman), are making their historic visit to the US. Franklin has invited the royal couple to spend the weekend with him at Springwood and the house is a flurry of activity making preparations. The visit has critical importance for both men. ""Bertie"", as George VI was known to his intimates, is extremely nervous, having been charged with the mission of persuading FDR to get the US on Britain's side in the conflict that everyone knew was coming. FDR's own objective in the well-publicized visit was to counter the isolationist faction in the country, using the young King and Queen to charm the American public and remind them of our historic ties to the British people and the need to stand together against the rising Nazi threat in Europe. Part of his plan though was to show the royals as being ""just like us"", which involved an open-air picnic at which hot dogs - among other things - would be served, a prospect which, when they heard about it, left the King baffled and the Queen appalled, both privately wondering if they were being mocked:

Bertie: ""At the picnic, the president's wife has organized hot dogs be served as our main dish.""
Elizabeth: ""Are they trying to make fun of us?""
Bertie: ""I... I don't know.""

To its credit, Hyde Park On Hudson is blessed with a number of excellent performances, the foremost of which is Bill Murray's thoroughly engaging portrayal of FDR. Murray's Franklin is a multi-faceted delivery that brings to life both the natural charm and empathy that enabled FDR to win over individuals in intimate settings as well as crowds and the nation as a whole, and the man's vulnerabilities, from the polio which he constantly strove to overcome and at the same time keep out of the public eye, to the chaos of his personal life stemming from clashes with - and between - his strong-willed mother and wife and from having more than one mistress at the same time. Elizabeth Wilson's Sara Roosevelt is a domineering matriarch with a strong sense of the proper way of things, determined to have her own way in her own house, regardless of Franklin being the President. Olivia Williams' Eleanor Roosevelt is strong, independent and pragmatic, carving out her own role and life as First Lady. For her, Franklin's infidelities have long since become a problem to be quietly managed rather than anything to get worked up over. Elizabeth Marvel's Marguerite ""Missy"" LeHand has a subtle task as FDR's private secretary whose job included knowing every detail of FDR's personal life and not revealing what she knew. Which it turns out is more than we suspect. Samuel West's Bertie is a fine portrayal of a man who never expected to be king, never in fact wanted to be king because of his shyness and embarrassing stammer, but whose sense of duty compelled him to step up to the plate and be one when his older brother Edward unexpectedly abdicated and fate then thrust it upon him. Olivia Colman's Elizabeth is the more out-going of the pair, but highly conscious of and protective towards her husband's dignity and position, and Colman brings this out convincingly, making Bertie and Elizabeth a husband and wife as well as King and Queen.

And as I mentioned, Lol Crawley's cinematography is lush and detailed, capturing the intimate details from how the individual rooms at Springwood were furnished to unique features like FDR's specially designed car that allowed him to drive himself around in spite of not being able to use his legs. His visuals bring to life a different era, giving that extra little touch of realism for the actors to use to their advantage, giving us a revealing glimpse into FDR's private world.

But that said, Hyde Park On Hudson does have its problems, most of which seem to stem from the script. As director, Roger Michell, who has notable films like Notting Hill, Changing Lanes and Venus among his credits, handles the individual scenes quite capably, but he cannot overcome the structural and character problems of Richard Nelson's screenplay. This may be due to Nelson's having very little experience writing for film, most of his work having been for the stage. Apparently Nelson originally did Hyde Park On Hudson as a radio play for the BBC in 2009, but what the differences were between that play and the eventual screenplay used for the film, I do not know. It is hard, however, to imagine the screenplay working any better in radio, if not being actually worse.

One of the key problems is that, plot-wise, the two stories don't really mesh with each other. The film starts as Daisy's story, told from her point of view as is emphasized by her opening voice-over narrative. However when things shift over to the King and Queen's visit, the structure quickly breaks down. For one thing, Daisy's involvement in the actual royal visit was virtually non-existent, making her role as the point-of-view character telling the story at once problematic. Particularly with regard to the private scenes between Bertie and Elizabeth, and between Bertie and Franklin, where she was obviously not present. As a result, the film has problem maintaining both rhythm and momentum. Just as one story gets going for a bit, it's interrupted and the film has to shift gears to deal with the other.

Another problem is that one story is simply so much better than the other. The scenes centered around FDR and the King and Queen are definitely the best parts of the film things actually flow when dealing with that story line. It also seems to bring out the best in all of the actors, both in terms of their performances and in the chemistry that evolves among them. These are the scenes in which Murray shines, bringing forth FDR's wit and enormous personal charm, showing us how and why FDR was the man he was. Particularly in the scenes where Franklin and Bertie are alone together and out of the public eye and he puts the anxious young king at ease, showing how much they have in common.

The story about FDR and Daisy is, well, awkward on so many levels you wish that they'd left it all on the cutting room floor. One problem is that the scenes dealing with their relationship just feel wrong. The `seduction' scene in particular. It's handled so awkwardly that you don't know whether to squirm or giggle, even though it's clearly not meant to be funny. And yet another big problem is a complete lack of chemistry between Linney's Daisy and Murray's FDR. You never really buy into the idea that these two had any kind of relationship, no matter what you're seeing on the screen. And in a broader sense, Daisy always seems out of place in every scene, which only adds to the awkwardness. I have to blame the script (again) for this as Linney is a fine actress as she has shown in films like You Can Count On Me, Kinsey and The Savages, all of which earned her Academy Award nominations, and other performances for which she has won both Emmy and Golden Globe awards. But sometimes even the best actors cannot overcome a weak script, and this I feel is one of those times.

Oddly enough, the film doesn't even mention Suckley's biggest contribution to FDR's public persona. One of Suckley's hobbies was raising Scottish Terriers, and it was she who gave him his dog Fala, who soon became ""the most photographed dog in the world"" as he was almost constantly with FDR wherever he went, including at many of his press conferences.

Recommended for Bill Murray's extraordinary performance and for the half that deals with the King and Queen's visit.

I liked Bill Murray as FDR and was surprised how little Laura Linney (one of my favorite actresses) impacts the film.  At least, Laura is blond and I could keep track of which character she was.  It took me a while to figure out who was playing Eleanor and who was MIssy. The actresses resemble each other so much.  Elizabeth (Olivia Colman) looks more like Bertie's mother than his wife.  (Especially when FDR reminds Eleanor that the royal couple is ""young"".)  Samuel West is the most outstanding performance of all.  He plays a wide appealing range as Bertie with both FDR and his wife. The director & producer commentary fleshes out what was involved in creating the film.  One of the three deleted scenes is extremely poignant--when the issue of Eleanor insisting that the black servants (who are from the White House staff) will serve at table in spite of the butler's disdain.
