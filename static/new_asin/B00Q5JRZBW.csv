6854652,5,B00Q5JRZBW,"DRIVE STEELBOOK IN a POP ART release.  This movie is definitely a cult classic for me I would easily place it in the best 100 movies. The atmosphere is outstanding the storyline simplistic but that's all that's needed here. R. Gosling gives a top performance in this, the beauty is that through the film The title is the Absolute meaning. I am extremely happy this is also is in my collection. I would definitely recommend it",1423094400,3,425,4.592105263157895

8690449,4,B00Q5JRZBW,"I fell in love with this film the first time I ever watched it, and this case is fantastic for displaying on a shelf or cabinet. I can't give it 5 stars, though I'd like to, because there's a pretty prominent dent on the rear of the case itself. I'm gonna make the assumption that this is because it might have been thrown by the delivery guy or just some form of rough handling. Other than that, this is definitely a great product.",1474070400,3,432,4.216867469879518
8690450,4,B00Q5JRZBW,"The movie itself is amazing, obviously, and the artwork here is great.  But my steelbook arrived with a big dent right in Gosling's hair...so beware when ordering, it will probably have a dent or imperfection in the case.",1454544000,2,221,4.815789473684211
8690451,5,B00Q5JRZBW,"If you are fan of Steelbooks and or Mondo art, then this is a no brainer. Its the first collab in a now growing series of released Steelbooks and is certainly among the very best of those released to this point (I think they are through 15 or so by now). If you collect Steelbooks, its a must own. If you already own the blu-ray thats another matter. Still, the film is one of Refn's brighter spots - at his peak of melding indie style with enough Hollywood to own a hit. Good stuff.",1449705600,3,483,4.148936170212766
8690452,5,B00Q5JRZBW,"I Have ordered this collectable Steelbook By Mondo & I am anxiously awaiting for its arrival. I would say by looking at the whole concept behind it, it does look great.  What to say about this film, brilliant, very expressive,  loads of characters that basically you could make a separate film about each & every one of them. Gosling shows some defined acting skills,  his character quiet,  polite, yet if needed out of nowhere very violent. Great thriller well worth to check it out & am pretty sure you will put this in you collection. Also check out other great stuff to come out of his mind. Only God forgives, Valhalla Rising, & Bronson!. Tom Hardy excellent!. Top notch!",1428883200,,676,4.65546218487395
