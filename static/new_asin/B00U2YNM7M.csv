8704182,1,B00U2YNM7M,"I bought this thinking it would be just a low budget biker movie. What it ended up being was just a bunch of women stripping down to just their panties in a desert with a few flashbacks thrown in here and there. Ultimately, I don't think this was even worth the film it was made on. If you want a good low budget biker movie, check out Running Cool, or even Chrome and Hot Leather. Don't waste your time with this.",1440979200,,414,4.1234567901234565
