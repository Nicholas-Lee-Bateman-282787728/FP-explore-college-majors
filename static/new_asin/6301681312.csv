So I went on the prowl to find another unedited version of the film.  I read some blogs and reviews and found out the best way to get the unedited version is to buy the VHS version of the film, and believe me I did!

I'm a firm believer in not watching movies on TV cause they edit some good stuff or with horror flicks some of the horror is taken out...very bubblegum in my opinion.  If you want unedited you have to buy the DVD, in this case don't.  Just warning you!

Love this film and liked how they blended horror and comedy into the script cause it made it a perfect balance.  Please if you plan on buying this film buy the VHS instead of the DVD or else you'll get edited version of the movie.  There is no unedited DVD of the movie so VHS is the only option.",1448928000,,926,3.935483870967742

7814013,1,6301681312,Terrible sequel is by far the worst of the series till part 4 arrived. A Canadian teen named Alex is failing school and  having trouble on the football team and then Mary Lou comes back to Hamilton High and then makes Alex popular and then he buries the dead bodies in the football field. This movie is a waste of time and only has one funny scene where Mary Lou throws a football at the bully and a spike stabs him.,1109635200,,416,4.135802469135802
7814014,5,6301681312,"Eighties horror movies, what would we do without them? Horror movies since the eighties have lost the gore and no budget effects that made them enjoyable to watch. Prom Night 3 achieves everything you could possibly want in a horror movie, goodlooking guys and girls, and did I mention the goodlooking guys?!:) Dylan Neal stars in this movie, and if he's hot now, he was certainly smoldering then!
The movie does have a certain budget look to it, but the story is straightforward and enjoyable, not to mention some of the best death scenes ever! I would really recommend this movie, and I would suggest inviting a few mates over, so you can have a laugh with the death scenes. Positively gory, but very well done. Enjoy!",1017446400,4,720,4.677165354330708
7814015,4,6301681312,"If it weren't for the ending, I would have rated it 5 stars, but as many times before, the ending destroys a movie. But to the film. This is  horror/comedy, so don't expect to be scared. But it has gore, and the one  scene where Alex is running naked in the hall, reminds me strongly about  Mr. Bean(! ) This time another Prom Queen return from the dead, and fall in  love with one of the present students. But how far are they willing to go  for love? Buy it, and find out.",966211200,,474,4.053763440860215
