8461176,5,B0057W5FF6,"The Burglar, 1957 film

The story begins in a movie theater where they show the news. A rich old woman boasts of her possessions: cars, house, emerald necklace. (She is a spiritualist who gets money from people.) A man in the audience leaves. Afterwards a young woman arrives at her house to make a donation: two silver quarters. She is invited to lunch. Later she returns to her gang; she has cased the joint. Three men go there to burglarize this house while the rich woman watches the 11pm news. [Fifteen minutes then] The leader of the gang drills and cracks the safe. When a police car stops the gang is alarmed. Nat knows how to talk his way out of a jam; his 1951 Chevrolet won't start. When the police leave he returns to finish the job with seconds to spare. The gang drives away and switches license plates. That rich old woman is shocked to see the open safe!

When the burglars return to their rooms Nat inspects the loot. This hot loot sold for $150,000 retail but is worth only $85,000 to a fence (receiver of stolen goods). The police make a plaster cast of the tire track. They know a recent visitor cased the joint. The police saw the face of the burglar, a big mistake. One of the gang wants to relocate to Central America and grow bananas. The policemen look at pictures of criminals. A police sketch artist draws a picture for a likeness. They will make a thousand pictures of the completed drawing and distribute them. [Policemen observe what others only see.] There is interpersonal conflict between the gang members. [Cabin fever?] Nat remembers his past and how he became a criminal as a boy. He is the legal guardian of Miss Gladden and wants her to go to Atlantic City for her health. [Is that the old Pennsylvania Railroad Station in NY city that was torn down in 1964?]

The burglars discuss their plans. Blaylock is nervous, he has a record. Nat walks around to show the background of Philadelphia Penna. He talks to a young woman in a bar. Do you do this often? [There will be a surprise here.] Ill be home, the door will be open. She tells her story; she is from a big family in Youngstown Ohio. She used to be a model for nature studies, one of the pictures broke up her marriage. Nat tells of his past. Later he learns what is really going on! Can one crook rob a gang? Not if they go to Atlantic City.

But the toll taker recognizes the drawing and calls in the cars description and license plate. The police figure out where the gang is going. Nat tells Gladden they will have to leave, he identified Charlie! But she doesnt want to leave. Charlie calls that other woman then watches that tar-paper shack. Nat gets a surprise when he returns. He talks to Charlie, then calls Gladden to warn her. Charlie knows how to operate. Nat and Gladden watch the acts at the Steel Pier. Charlie finds them. The Police arrive outside. Nat makes a deal. :Nice work, Charlie. He tried to get away. But things don't go as planned! And so it ends.

This is interesting for its setting in Philadelphia and Atlantic City, not Los Angeles or New York. Its a lower budget movie, telling how greed corrupts people. Jayne Mansfield is credible in her role, one different from her later career. Dan Duryea plays a good bad guy. It reminded me of the plot for The Asphalt Jungle.",1423440000,,3290,4.449419568822554
