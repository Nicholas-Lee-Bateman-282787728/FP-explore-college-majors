8478125,4,B005LF86YG,"The 1 star review is,for the most part,entirely correct:no stereo mix,non-widescreen,static camera angles,and ""terrible""sound. So why do I give it 4 stars?Honestly, anyone familiar with 1349 is accustomed to them not sounding all that great even on their cds...they are such a peculiar,complex band that it has been, so far, impossible to capture their intended sound on record;look back to ""Liberation"" and how utterly horrified many were with the sound; I actually like that sound the best of any of their albums! Upon first listen,""Hellvetia Fire"" does sound terrible, but I was able to adjust the tone controls on my stereo to get an acceptable sound. Was not able to get a""great""sound...but I am also not able to get a totally satisfying sound from any of their studio albums. So, if kept within that perspective,this live dvd isn't really that bad. I'd actually rate it more 3.5stars, as I feel it is too short(yes,it is just under 60 minutes),but I am satisfied with the camera angles...no member of the band is really ignored(like we've seen in many other videos),and there is plenty of footage of the macabre genius Frost in action behind the drumkit; something many of us in the States have never been allowed to witness live. Having just seen 1349 in June of this year, I can attest that this really is pretty close to what they do sound like live(at least the 2 times I saw them),though I think their more recent stage presentation is a bit more intense. This dvd is not entirely in black and white, but for the bulk of the show the only colour is a vague tinting (most notable in the eyes of the huge""Hellfire""helmet hanging behind the stage); though very ""nekro"",I felt this was kind've a gyp. There is a cool appearance by Tom G. Warrior (of Hellhammer,Celtic Frost,and Tryptikon fame)doing vocals for one of his old classics along with 1349(during which Ravn bows out).HOWEVER,please combine these(so far)two reviews if you are considering buying this:if you are looking for a pristine picture,rich sound,and all the other features of a ""professional""dvd band's release, avoid this by all means. If you are accustomed to 1349's recorded-sound shortcomings,you can put up with this easily. I honestly don't know why anyone felt the need to release this,as most of the buying public would definitely not have the proper perspective to accept this,but maybe the ""official bootleg"" tagline being in such fine print is an indicator that SOMEone knew that this really isn't up to expected modern standards! If this is someone's first exposure to 1349,it certainly isn't going to impress the Hell out of them, a disservice to this intensely brilliant band. On the other hand,perhaps the minds behind the mostly-terrible""Revelations of the Black Flame"" album also thought being represented by this bootleg would be a ""good idea""? By the way, my Mommy got this for my Birthday!",1350864000,2,2884,4.9730848861283645
8478126,1,B005LF86YG,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, unless you care NOTHING about even the barest minimum of sound quality, and think that a black metal concert should sound like it was literally recorded in a tin can to be ""trve"" and ""cvlt.""
1349's ""Hellvetia Fire"" DVD is a joke. Sounds like it was recorded by an audience member on a micro-cassette recorder, and it's in MONO. And the video display is not even widescreen - it's the old-fashioned 1.33:1 aspect ratio meant to be played, apparently, on your grandparents' rabbit-ear television.
The filming isn't bad, if you don't mind 4 or 5 static cameras that remain rooted to the spot for the entire concert. Why would any self-respecting artist or record label release cr@p like this without clearly labeling it ""sub-bootleg quality"" and giving it away for free? This isn't some found footage from the early 1990s, it was recorded in 2010 fer chrissake, but it's in MONO, with terrible sound quality and 1.33:1 aspect ratio! I guess if you enlarge the artwork you might catch ""The Official 1349 Bootleg"" subtitle under the main title, but that doesn't begin to describe how bad ""Hellvetia Fire"" is.
So consider this review your warning. You could do better with a handheld video camera yourself at one of their gigs.",1327449600,6,1246,4.8
