8609246,4,B00ET9D546,"Love Veggie Tales songs. This DVD has all of the silly songs!
I didn't like the format of the DVD itself. First there were no closed captions even though the case says they have it. The sing-a-longs were on a separate disc. On this disc you had to click each song individually. There was no play all button. Very frustrating. If you wanted to play all songs in a row without having to hit them individually, that was on the other disc. But then again, no closed captions and no sing-a-long feature here. The narrations should have CC since the sing-a-long words didn't have conversations/narrations as part of the sing-a-long.",1526342400,,626,4.7
