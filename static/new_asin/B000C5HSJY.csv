2452871,1,B000C5HSJY,"So called fans ripping off other fans.

I recieved unsolicited spam to review this, so here it goes.  I believe Michael Jackson is a pedophile.  I was dismayed, but not surprised, when the jury let him get away with his crimes.  Six months later and the court of public opinion has spoken.  Michael Jackson has run away from home to a country with no extradition treaty with the US.  It seem's odd that a man who couldn't handle a 100 yard walk from his suv to the courthouse without his delicate ""vitiligo ravaged"" skin being protected by an umbrella moves to one of the hottest countries on the planet.

I find it odd - and a bit disconcerting - that fans are having to cobble together this kind of thing in order to defend a man with a history of payoffs to victims to keep them quiet.  A man who has admitted to sharing his bed with unrelated boys, a man who wept and whined down the phone to the mother of one of his ""special friends"" in the early hours of the morning begging to have her son delivered like a take out because Michael couldn't sleep without him.  More fool her for delivering said child.  But everyone makes allowances because he's ""Michael Jackson"".

And this dvd is more of it.  More people making allowances for a pedophile because he ""had a hard childhood"" etc etc.  What's the difference between this and, say, CourtTV releasing their own ""behind the scenes"" version?  None.  It's just that their rip off would have a different spin.

Aside from the whole distasteful idea of defending a pedophile, this is over priced.  And if the cover artwork is any indication of the production values, it looks amateur in the extreme.

This kind of hack job should be avoided like the plague.",1134000000,6,1707,4.504885993485342

2452873,5,B000C5HSJY,"...and maybe didn't know. Packed with celebrities, who, like his true fans, know the REAL Michael Jackson and facts the media didn't tell, this is a must for any Jackson fan and anyone who wants the whole story and the real truth: That Michael is a warm and generous human being as well as a talented artist, and a loving parent himself. So sad that so many forgot the generous work he's done for children over the years, especially kids like Ryan White! Highly recommend.",1133913600,6,472,4.564705882352941
2452874,5,B000C5HSJY,"I received it today! I really enjoyed it and am very impressed with the way the documentary was put together. At times tears came to my eyes just from the memories of my time in Santa Maria and out in front of Michael's Neverland gates. It was intense for us and I know we cannot even imagine how intense it was for Michael!

It was so nice to see an honest report of what went on. I truly wish your documentary would be played on international television. So many reporters were unfair in their coverage.

The world should see your coverage! Thank you so much for your report.",1132617600,2,577,4.333333333333333
2452875,4,B000C5HSJY,"I just sat down with friends to watch ""Behind the Scenes,"" with a few of my friends. And by the impact was rather positive from what I was hearing from them. It got us talking about issues, and they were amazed at how some of the points made gave them a different perspective from what the media feed them.

It wasn't to resolve issues, but to give a brief synopsis of what was happening out side of the court, the controversies, and the conspiracies, the inaccuracies from tabloids to inappropriate reporting that gave the viewer two different versions of what was going on, both inside and out of the court. More importantly how the fans, who came from all over the world, felt about the case itself, many more knowledgeable than the reports telling the story themselves.

It touched on racism, Sony and medical discrepancies that plaque Michael throughout the trial with professionalism. It is an unbiased affirmative piece that is hard-hitting in one sense, and painful on other, yet the antics of most fans gave the piece some humor and soften the seriousness of the subject matter.

The best part of course, didn't need any explaining, its visuals of Michael coming out of court, along with the background song ""With a Child's Heart,"" gave it an ending that truly touched my heart.

Overall, it was a well put together piece that represents Jackson in a positive way and with good taste.

It is now time for us to move on with life to more positive things and to look forward to what Michael may share with us in the New Year.

2452876,5,B000C5HSJY,"""Behind the Scenes at the Michael Jackson Trial"" is a must-see for any Jackson fan and supporter--for those of us who went to Santa Maria to support Michael and his family, watching this is almost like being there again. For those who wanted to go but could not, it is a factual and realistic footage of fans and media outside the courthouse and interviews with locals who supported Michael, as well as a review of events leading up to the trial, as the trial progressed, and the glorious victory day.

This would also help to open the eyes of those who do not support and believe in Michael Jackson's innocence, and for this reviewer, it is a hope-they-see!!",1138838400,19,659,4.584745762711864

2452879,5,B000C5HSJY,Yes I liked this DVD it showed alot of truthful information about the trial.  The lady who was reporting was in the court room herself so she knew what was REALLY going on inside.  I hated seeing the biased reportes by Diane Dimond on Court TV she never had anything positive to say it was all one sided.  You don't label someone as a child abuser unless they have been found guilty and he was found INNOCENT on all 10 charges by a jury.  You cant convict someone if you have no evdience against him and they prosecution had NO evdience.  This DVD is worth buying if you want to know the truth.,1136332800,13,594,4.221238938053097
2452880,5,B000C5HSJY,"I loved watching this docuality! It showed the true facts of Michael's INNOCENCE! It proved that many of the ""facts"" were false, biased, UNtrue, completelty fabricated, made up, and racially charged. It proved that this prosecution team is truley a persecution team. And it shows why Michael J. Jackson was fully acquitted, vindicated, and Exonerated. This was fantastic.",1135814400,11,371,5.413793103448276
2452881,1,B000C5HSJY,"This documentary is nothing more than a farce--something for rabid fans to use to show as ""proof"" that their god is so truly innocent and simply once again (for the 2683th time), the victim of some vast conspiracy pitting the entire universe against Michael Jackson.  This DVD is nothing more than a rehash of Camp Jackson's much convaluted and contradictory reasons for why Jackson is so often misunderstood and mistreated by the media, government and the entertainment industry.

If you are looking for unbiased information on the circus more commonly referred to as the Michael Jackson trial, this is not it.  In constrast, Diane Dimond's recently published book ""Be Careful Who You Love:  Inside the Michael Jackson Case"" and Bob Jones/Stacy Brown's ""Michael Jackson: The Man Behind the Mask"" both provide much more realistic reporting, complete with documented resources, for a much better price.

Luckily, the writer and producer, ""Pearl Jr."" admits he/she is a Jackson fanatic and that this DVD is based on videos and interviews with other fanatics.  If you are a rabid fan, though, this DVD will give you more chances to hide your head in the sand.",1134432000,5,1156,5.026178010471204
2452882,5,B000C5HSJY,"This documentary explains why the jury found Michael Jackson innocent of ALL charges.  For anyone who is confused about the difference between what the media reported and why the jury found him NOT GUILTY, this is the documentary for you.

This documentary moved so fast, the 45 minutes seemed like 15 minutes.  I couldn't even answer the phone because it was so interesting and offered a different perspective from the media hyped sensationalism.  The fans and anti-fans were very funny and actually extremely intoxicating.  The support from the show business community proves that the KING OF POP still has what it takes to overcome the lies and distortions.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1134259200,8,681,5.1454545454545455
2452883,1,B000C5HSJY,"I am incredibly sorry I wasted both my time and money on this. Written and produced by an admitted Michael Jackson fanatic, it tells a very one sided and fictional story.  Full of other Jackson fanatics who believe they ""know"" Jackson because they've listened to his music.

Continually protrays Jackson as someone who has been victimized his entire life, tells the various contradicting sides of the Jackson camp who are known for being proven liars, and ignores court documented facts.  According to these fanatics, Jackson must be the receiving end of every conspiracy theory -- real or imagined.

On the good side, there is much comedy in the DVD as the various Jackson fanatics are interviewed and attempt to educate the public about Jackson.  They remind me of children who do everything they can for attention.  This DVD could be entered as evidence of why forced institutionalization and sterilization should be reimplemented on some population groups.

2452884,1,B000C5HSJY,"It makes no bones about presenting only the alleged good side of Michael Jackson. I'd gotten an unsolicited piece of spam to come and review it. There's a copy of the DVD floating around the Internet, so I have gotten a chance to see it and after being astonished at the amatuerish work and disgusted by the blatant misinformation contained I decided to give as honest a review as I can without being as insulting as this opus of nonsense deserves.

It ignores most of the facts and evidence and instead focuses on any positives that could be gleaned, some are quite a stretch.

If you are looking for something to cite when someone claims Jackson is a pedophile or abuser of many substances, you're definitely wasting your time.

This is no more than a vanity piece, unless you are in it on purpose, I see no reason to purchase it or support any future efforts.",1134000000,13,862,4.512820512820513

8095714,5,B000C5HSJY,"Michael Jackson doesn't have fans just becasue he has good music. If you believe that then you have no business making comments as such. There is so much more to Michael and that's what the negative people don't get. His talent and albums and videos/short fllms and concerts were just a little hobbie for Jackson to utilize it as it was meant' to be used. His concern for the world period.

 He was concerned about the human condition in countries that would let down their own people and such. He went out of his way to use his own money to help the poor and under priviledged because it would bother him that no one else was giving a damn. He had concerns for every human being on this earth and loving chidren wasn't a crime.  Yes they were the victims of neglect by their own government and on top of that this world was falling apart and Michael did what he could to try and change alot of negativities where ever it was needed. After all no one else was doing anything. The Government never lifts a finger since they're goal is to let these people die and he knew that. And the haters want to be judgemental because he had a big heart and made everyone else look bad? Open your eyes and pay attention to what I just said. Start using your head and open your closed minds and think about why the nonsense of accusations and really now? If you don't see it by now than you're all bigger fools than I thought you were.

Also Michael isn't the only one victimized by the powers that be. He was a threat becasue of the love he was trying to spread around the world and showing people of all ages how not to hate and get along and the list goes on. The evil trolls didn't like it and set him up, you don't like what you're reading then tough! You're angry becasue the truth hits you in the face. Learn to be suspicious when an artist dies due to an overdose, and if you still don't see what I know then you're a lost cause.

Keep in mind that Michael winning over and over pissed off the powers that be and their plan didn't work so what was the next thing to do to get what they wanted? MURDER! Can you hear me now?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That's why we keep defending him and keep trying to spread the truth about his innocence. There's alot more to this than you're getting and if you don't understand the above than get out of the way and let it go. This is way above your head you need to let us do what it takes to get the truth out there.

I'll let you in on one secret, the media was paid to let people like you buy into the lies for a reason and you fell for it. That makes you weak and clueless. Lesson #1-- Never trust the media period. They're financially motivated and nothing else matters even when they know they real truth. It's either report what sells or get fired. Think about that and simmer on it.",1306713600,5,2809,4.190740740740741

8095716,3,B000C5HSJY,"I purchased this film thinking that I was going to get a chance to see what I hadn't seen--some behind the scenes footage of the Michael Jackson trial. I was convinced of Jackson's innocence prior to watching this piece because I followed the court summary on CNN and other media that were allowed access to just outside the courtroom and obtained seats inside the court. Geraldo Rivera had already seen the evidence and claimed that if Michael Jackson was convicted on the evidence that the prosecution had, he would shave his mustache. He didn't have to.
I had hoped that this film would give me a visual of the scenes in the court and comments from people who had gained entry. Unfortunately, this film was an amateurish DVD put together by a fan who had good intentions as far as trying to salvage the image of Michael Jackson and provide an alternative to other biased reporting in the negative, but obviously had little experience with doing quality documentary pieces. If ""Pearl Jr."" did this to make money from Jackson's name then her mission was probably accomplished. However, if she was trying to convince anyone that this was an objectively reported documentary, it failed miserably. Not only are some of the ""facts"" harmlessly wrong, but even a Jackson sympathizer would feel cheated out of this poorly reported home video. She would have done better to hire film and journalism graduate students to help her achieve aims.",1274486400,4,1435,4.8612244897959185
8095717,4,B000C5HSJY,"this movie should definitely be accomanied by the book ""michael jackson conspiracy"" - i just finished reading that awesome book before viewing this movie - i wanted to get an idea of what it all looked like at the scene. the book is amazing and went into lots of detail, and seeing this movie was neat because it touched on some things that were discussed in far more detail in the book, and so i really had a depth of understanding going into this.

three of the things i thought were amazing about this movie -

1. it showed how many people from all different parts of the world came to support mj in his trial - showed them at the gates of neverland and also outside the courtroom

2. had a plastic surgery expert on here talking about how the surgery is explained to the patient - said that in the patient's mind, they may have fewer surgeries than the public thinks they have had because it is explained to the patient that the first one or two are surgeries, and then the subsequent ones are just tweeking what they've done. so in mj's mind, he very well may have had just one or two surgeries - according to how the doctors explain things to their patients (that was really neat for me to find out)

3. the truth prevailed and mj was pronounced ""not guilty""",1259884800,5,1264,4.320675105485232

8095721,5,B000C5HSJY,"The Michael Jackson trial was the trial of the century for numerous reasons.  The Michael Jackson haters and persecuters could not understand his greatness, and decided they would not tolerate the world's appreciation of his incomparable talent, his legendary entertainment, and unparalleled kindness.  The disgusting and ignorant heads of hatred, greed and racism raised to their heights when a gentle humanitarian (Michael Jackson), was falsely and unbelievably accused of a henious crime.  This was their heartless attempt to take away all that Michael Jackson had sacrificed to achieve.  This documentary shares truths and facts that every person has the right to know.  Here we find facts that the mainstream [tabloidal] media would not present because of the cowardice of some and for others there were $$ to be earned for hiding these truths from the public.  The deceitful mainstream media presentation was the persecuters attempt to brainwash our people to believe the world's greatest and most admired entertainer has lost our love (how absurd).  The media smear campaign was an attempt to persuade the public that the most famous man on this earth is no longer popular (how senseless).  The merciless MJJ oppressors want to convince us that MJJ, was doing harm to the people who concerned him most (how preposterous).  Michael Jackson is our most valiant children's advocate, and there is not a living person who has done more for children or humanity than the King of Pop.  Now on this DVD from Elbow Grease Productions, they present honest facts about the case that we could only know if we were in the courtroom, or paid a visit to Neverland.
