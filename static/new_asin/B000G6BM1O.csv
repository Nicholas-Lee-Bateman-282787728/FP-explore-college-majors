2600342,3,B000G6BM1O,"This documentary is an interesting concept, throw 150 video cameras at a population of people in a war torn country and see what they have to say.....like I said its interesting.

If you can get beyond watching a bunch of amateurs trying to film their lives this film really has some important information contained within it. Over a course of several months video cameras were distributed throughout Iraq and passed from person to person in hopes of obtaining a realistic look at what life is like in Iraq today. Although I found this movie quite intriguing I also question the editing.....in 90 minutes of film there is only a stray comment here and there showing any negative view of the American occupation. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the smiles and laughter from Iraqi children and hearing that most of the people included on this film were very pro-American but I am not convinced it is a true representation of Iraq today. In America, a democracy and a country of peace, we can't even agree between neighbors on who should run our own country so to try and sell a war torn country as a happy go lucky nation with only one opinion about its future I just found it to be a very hard sell. If it were all true then Americans would not still be getting killed in an effort to establish democracy, it would automatically exist and be agreed upon.

Some of the clips incorporated into this film show insurgent ads that are geared towards recruitment of people opposing the war in Iraq. These people were not given video cameras and probably for a good reason! But if this film is to be the ""voice"" of a new democracy shouldn't all voices be counted? Don't tell me Iraq will be colored red and blue too.....for true democracy and peace to exist someone, somewhere has to agree on something, right? This film definitely shows the brutality of the Saddam regime with a few clips that are downright brutal. I have no doubt that many Iraqis are thrilled to have their horrible dictator out of power but I just can't see anyone agreeing with bombs, poverty and mass confusion on a daily basis....it has to affect a person with more than a smile! I would have been more impressed with this film had the producers chosen to show a more honest representation of the true Iraq it seems to me that after all they have been through they deserve better and they certainly deserve a chance to speak with a honest mind rather than a voice covered in red.",1100822400,19,2441,4.570776255707763
2600343,5,B000G6BM1O,"The media's negative potrayal of Iraq, the Iraqi people, and our military, has been shoved down our throats for so long now.  Finally, we get to see the truth about this country, the people, and why our military is there.  No media involved. Just these wonderful people of Iraq.

Viewing this film will answer many questions you may have about our Government's decision to remove a madman from power.  Of course, if you are an anti-war or anti-whatever liberal, you must not watch it because it may give you a different view of the whole situation and we can't have that can we.  But if you are pro-humanitarian, you will watch this film again and again, with hope for these strong, intelligent, and humourous citizens of Iraq.

The producers of this film did something that no media outlet would have the gut's to do.  They deserve major recognition for their efforts.  Since the main stream media does not want us to see this side of Iraq, it up to us to make this happen, so encourage all of your friends & family to purchase this film.

One disagreement with the previous reviewer, I believe that this film should be seen by children.  Although a few parts are hard to watch, seeing what the Iraqi children have been thru and how positive and funny they are, is very important.",1100649600,12,1281,4.578947368421052
2600344,5,B000G6BM1O,"My wife and I rented it from NetFlix and really liked it. It stirs up some strong positive, as well as negative, emotions. I would recommend it to anybody (but not children). (In fact, I'm going to buy a copy of it.)

The maker of the film evidently had success with a hit series on MTV, and claims they had no political agenda with the film - that they just wanted to let the Iraqis tell their own story. (It would be fun to see movies like this of other places in the world, too.)

One thing that struck me was how happy the Iraqi people looked. I think we Americans could learn a lesson from them. For many of them, this is the first time in their lives they've been able to express their opinions without fear, and it shows. You can't help but feel optimistic for them.

I read one review where it was pointed out that the negative side is more prevalent at the start of the film. But it's hard to say whether that's not actually a reflection of the general mood of the 400 hours of footage collected. (Maybe most of the people REALLY WERE optimistic.) It's quite possible that, we, who often times take our freedom for granted, don't recognize the enormous value it has to those who don't have it.

I would consider this film ""must"" viewing for everyone.

2600345,5,B000G6BM1O,"In this tumultous time of an out of control US president launching a preemptive assault on Iraq, I have been searching for independent and 'inside' accurate information concerning the state of Iraq and its people since the war began. This film is a collection of videos created by 150 camcorders handed out to the Iraqi citizens. All sorts of citizens are free to give their opinion on many different topics and they do. It is fascinating and it made glad and more hopeful my heart. Though I have detested the US gov't for initiating this war, twenty years from now or maybe sooner, I might feel that it did ultimately open up the opportunity for the Iraqi people to use their strength, determination, intelligence and desire and to create their own freedom and their own free country.",1100476800,10,785,4.737226277372263
2600358,2,B000G6BM1O,"It is worth to see it because it shows how a' part' of people is living there and those who are surprised to see 'normal' life going on even if in difficult condition, are on my opinion a bit 'naive'. Not to be called, for this reason, a documentary. Let's try to go into some details: is it possible to make a documentary on Elephants, not having seen them even once in life and from a prospective of our nice and well equipped office? wouldn't be better avoiding to add 'directed from Iraqi people'?

There has been a selection of the returned material and the cutting, which is clearly in a certain direction, strongly influence the message. But even if admitting there has been no manipulation, the interviewed people answers in a different way depending on who is supposed to be sent the recorded material. That means that even if  we try to be objective, this result is impossible to be obtained because we influence the one who is in front of the camera: all the people/children exultating for the 'americans' wouldn't shout as well for the 'italians' if they knew the camera came from Italy? The questions they often answer is not clear but seems to be: What is it positive or better now than before?  The old footage showing the Saddam's crimes in Kurdistan creates in the audience a natural sense of repulsion consequently a satisfactory feeling that this dictator is no more there, BUT, a documentarist should also mention why the 'liberating' force didn't react at that time and show us the strong alliance between USA and Saddam. Nowadays there are many political formations in Iraq, many different opinions, why only the more aligned are shown? Has anybody considered that, maybe, showing in pubblic a strong dissatisfaction could be 'dangerous' for themselves, or even to be considered a Terrorist?  This film is, deeply analysed, mainly an American propaganda.",1124064000,4,1876,4.834890965732087
2600359,5,B000G6BM1O,"Whether or not this film is intentional propaganda can be debated, but what cannot be debated is the effectiveness of this film to obliterate American stereotypes of the Iraqi people.  No one can walk away from this film without a sense of the richness, complexity, and diversity of humanity that is found in Iraq.  Any film that can place a human face on Iraq's struggle must be labeled a success.",1121731200,7,398,4.671428571428572
2600360,5,B000G6BM1O,"It was beyond what I expected.  The DVD is still circulating my network of friends.  A true window into post-Saddam Iraq, it allows us to stare right through the eyes of the Iraqi people.",1115510400,5,187,4.470588235294118
2600361,5,B000G6BM1O,"I recently had the opportunity to attend a showing of Voices of Iraq that was followed by a highly informative question and answer session with its three producers.  The film is a moving and eye-opening experience that should be seen by everyone seeking to understand what's happening in Iraq today.  Video cameras were handed out to various Iraqis along with some loose guidelines and a few suggested questions (they were also encouraged to think of their own questions).  These Iraqis then interviewed their friends and filmed their lives.  Every level of Iraqi society is represented, from high ranking politicians to auto mechanics, school girls to great-grandmothers, artists, bloggers, musicians, Marsh Arabs, refugees from Falluja and just about everyone else.

These people are surprisingly optimistic about the future of Iraq and eager to move forward.  They have a sense of humor, a modern outlook and are relieved that Saddam is gone.  The Iraqis asked the film's producers to include footage taken by Uday Hussein of dissidents getting their tongues cut out.  The Iraqis were concerned that the stories of people getting their tongues cut out were being taken with a grain of salt in the West - in other words, as metaphors about Hussein's treatment of dissenters and not the literal truth.  Some other footage from Baath party archives is shown as are advertisements made by the insurgents asking for aid from other countries and thanking Syria's Assad for the help he has provided.

Headlines from various mainstream American newspapers are shown on the screen followed by Iraqis talking about these events.  The difference between the headlines and the Iraqis' response to them is startling.  A headline about the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse is followed by a scene in which a group of Iraqi men have lunch and talk about the scandal.  Many of these men had been in Abu Ghraib when it was run by Hussein.  They consider the scandal to be a joke - they literally laugh while talking about how this abuse compared with their own experiences in the prison.  One says that America's apology for the scandal was the first time he'd ever heard a government apologize for anything.  Headlines proclaiming a ""quagmire"" in Iraq are followed by Iraqis talking about the improving situation in their country.  There were many examples of this sort of thing.

After the film, the producers were asked about anti-American sentiment.  Was it edited out?  There was anti-Americanism in the film, the producers reminded us.  After a bit of reflection I realized why this anti-Americanism was so hard to notice:  Unlike quotes in a newspaper or sound bites on TV, these statements were shown in context.  One guy was complaining about Americans when one of his friends said, ""shut up about that already!  You've been complaining about the Americans all day.""  One woman said that Iraq was better off with Hussein in charge while her sister responded with an epithet that would get the sensors around here scrambling for the delete button if I wrote it out.  This is followed by laughter.

They say that a picture is worth a thousand words.  It's a saying that clearly applies here.  The anti-Americanism and suggestions that Hussein should be brought back are like the comments among Americans comparing Bush to Hitler - they are expressions of frustration with current difficulties.  The producers pointed out that they are registered democrats and that the editing was done by a team of Arabs from various countries who were given wide latitude to select what they saw as significant moments.  The producers said that making the film had made them realize how accustomed we are to seeing Iraq through our own political lense.

Voices of Iraq throws the distoritions of the Western media into stark relief and shocks us with the disconnect between our perceptions of Iraq and the reality of that country.  It also reminds us of a stunningly obvious fact that has somehow been forgotten amidst our poisoned and politicized debate over Iraq:  That these people are human beings and not fanatical caricatures of anti-American rage.  For these reasons and many others, Voices of Iraq will be remembered as a unique and indispensable document of the Iraq War.  It is also powerful evidence that Iraq's future will be a bright one.",1114560000,7,4321,4.9944055944055945
2600362,2,B000G6BM1O,"I'm sorry but I just found the idea of rounding up kids and having them spew George W. Bush talking points, and then calling it a documentary wrong.  And if you have any doubt about whether or not this film is legit in what it says it is, then I have one scene I must point you towards.  Near the end of the film the person holding the camera is asking a man behind a counter questions. He doesn't like them and asks ""Who is writing these questions?"" The person holding the camera responds with ""I don't know."" Now don't you think that if that person were writing the questions that they would know that? Also, it's not my point, but is worth reiterating. . .this movie could not have been directed by the people of Iraq. Even if all they did was carry cameras around Iraq then they are simply cameramen. They did not insert stock footage of head's being chopped off. Nor did they edit the film, or anything else.  No, this film is not a total white wash but it is close. They show poor Iraqi's, then cut to Saddam's palaces. Maybe they would like to cut from the room my girlfriend and I are renting out in Brooklyn with the $20,000 combined we make each year and compare it to Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas.  I also found it especially distasteful when they rounded by Iraqi's who could justify Abu Gharib, then had others speak of how horrible it is that they were tortured by Uday Hussein. Aren't we all people? Isn't a crime against a man a crime against a man? Yes, I am opposed to the Iraqi war, at heart I am a liberal and an isolationist, so it really didn't sit well with me. I don't feel as though it is okay to sacrifice American troops for any of the reasons put forth by Bush. Of course I want what is best for the Iraqi people, but that comes second to making sure the American people are taken care of.  This film has us believe that all Iraqi's thought what we did was right. Why no interviews with ""insurgents?"" And that it is worth the lives of the one thousand plus troops we have lost in Iraq. I simply disagree. And while this film is a high and original concept it forgets one very important fact. If you want people to watch your propaganda you have to make it entertaining. **1/2",1111363200,5,2206,4.267942583732057
2600363,4,B000G6BM1O,"My husband and I both enjoyed this film.  It is a feast for your eyes, ears and mind.  Not agenda driven, but seemingly open and candid viewpoints of mostly everyday people in a difficult transition.  We liked that it covered a lot of different areas and enough time to get reaction over changes happening in Iraq.  Should be required watching in the ongoing dialogue over the war.

Would have given it 5 stars, but the subtitles are awful - hard to read: tiny, not enough contrast, and they flash too quickly on the screen.  Too bad, because it diminished all their hard work.  I could have gotten more out of it if I hadn't missed 20% of the dialogue.  We finished the movie with serious eyestrain, but a lot to think about.  Highly recommended!",1110153600,5,747,4.514925373134329
2600364,5,B000G6BM1O,"...........a point of view that is not filtered through political agendas.

This is the Iraq that I have been hearing the american soldier (who is actually over there doing the dirty work) talk about.

I 'highly' recommend this film to anyone who is passionate about our involvement in this war (no matter which side of the issue you are on). This should be required curriculum in american high schools, colleges, and universities!

2600365,5,B000G6BM1O,"The beginning of this unique film shows people openly hostile about the American Army and the takeover in Iraq.  The movie goes on to deliver a kind of insight into ordinary Iraqis and how they percieve the war, the US Army and the country's hopes for democratic freedom.

There is much controversy about the editing and funding of the movie on various Internet blog sites.  Within the movie, the editors are identified as employees of a TV production/news facility within Iraq.

Again, according to the content of the movie itself, the movie is produced by Iraqis for the American people and other people around the world.  It is interspersed with interviews with those who suffered at the hands of Saddam.

The sequence about the Iraqi success in the World Soccer finals shows us a people with a deep national pride and who are getting used to their new found freedom.  The Kurds live a life of relative luxury, attributed by the interviewees as directly a result of the US No-Fly-Zone and their relative protection from Saddam since the time of the First Gulf War.

It is moving and well worth seeing.",1106611200,8,1104,4.7434554973821985
2600366,5,B000G6BM1O,"I returned from Iraq in june of 2004. This movie is the most accurate portrait of the Iraqi public opinion that I have encountered. I know that this film showed a small sampling of what a few people think, but it was well rounded. I found this film to be both uplifting and heart breaking. It is definitly worth seeing. It didn't come to a lot of theaters but I was lucky to see it in Marion, Iowa of all places. I applaude the manager of that theater for bringing such a powerful film to my area.

2600367,4,B000G6BM1O,"My husband and I watched the dvd from Netflix and were so impressed with the candor with which it is made. We have a son fighting in Al Anbar province and I must confess that we wanted to see the images of the real Iraq more than we wanted to hear the message of the people. Our son is too  busy to send us pictures and especially video of everyday life there and we were dying with curiosity to see the movie. I have to say that it was far better than we thought it would be. Usually these documentary type films are a snooze and we were hoping not to fall asleep. It was riviting from the get go. We found ourselves hanging on every word because the people were speaking from their hearts and their message was, ""Please help us to have freedom for the first time ever."" Especially poignant was the conversation of the men who had been prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison under Sadaam and were finding it hilarious that our people thought that the ""abuse"" of the prisoners under our soldiers was torture. They pointed out that we do not know what torture is and showed which men in the prison were their former guards and torturers and detailed some of their atrocities.

 I found the film eye-opening and would reccomend it highly. I will send my son a copy as soon as it is available.",1101772800,11,1282,4.3112033195020745
8129036,3,B000G6BM1O,"It is exactly what it says it is - voices of Iraq. Now, just for a second, imagine what ""voices"" you would have if you handed out hundreds of cameras to regular citizens in the US and asked them to just go crazy and record their daily lives. That is what this film is only the setting, the citizens, being in Iraq. Make up your own mind the value of that. For me, while a somewhat interesting and an often unseen point of view, I'm still on the fence of the value. Going back to the example of doing the same thing in the US, I can't say as it would mean much - focusing on what regular citizens ""believe"". People often have no clue, especially people who have been repressed for so long as they admit throughout. You may as well ask a soldier why his government is at war. As if he would know. He's a pawn, as much as these voices of Iraq are the audience, in the games of much more rich and powerful men.",1350086400,,906,4.067039106145251

My friend left Iraq because he is a Christian and in constant fear for his well-being.

The video footage on this is all amateur and can be a little shaky and choppy at times, but the essence of what people are saying while sharing their experiences - sometimes even while chaos is breaking out around them - is very telling and sometimes very poignant. I can only imagine what direction the stability of country has headed towards in the nearly nine years since the video footage was created. I hope that the people there are able to find peace and rebuild their lives.

The war in Iraq has been a mixed blessing for the people there and I liked that this documentary touched on so many different emotions and even has lighter moments of humor among the many tales of hardship and loss.",1320019200,,986,4.472222222222222
8129038,4,B000G6BM1O,If you want to feel good about the US occupation about Iraq watch this film however as a couple of other reviewers commented it is very dated. Almost all of the footage is from 2004. Even from 2004 it is suspiciously positive. No mention of the looting of the National Museum of Iraq or that the US focused it very limited security effort on oil infrastructure. Were the Iraqis totally unaware of this?  My understanding is that many Iraqis had high hopes early on but have become very frustrated with the lack of security and infrastructure improvements. It would be very interesting to see the same type of movie made in 2008. It wouldn't be too hard as it is mostly just a bunch of Iraqis interviewing each other with cheap video cameras in various parts of the country. Regardless it is worth watching to make the human connection that they are people just like us and not evil figments of the American imagination. If they come out with an updated one I will be first in line to watch that.,1227484800,,995,4.497237569060774
8129039,2,B000G6BM1O,"I rented this film the other night from blockbuster. I've been drawn to any documentaries which shed light on the Iraq situation out of a hunger for knowledge regarding whats really going on there. I was initially impressed by the film but couldn't shake a nagging suspicion that something might be fishy with this film. While I will not make any blanket statements regarding the true nature of this film I will present you with a few interesting details about the film that struck me as odd, so that you might come to your own informed conclusion. (some content taken from Wikipedia)

1. ""...the film's public relations were handled by MS&L, ""a P.R. firm employed by the Army"" even though same firm also represents General Motors, Nestle, Philips, and Procter & Gamble and in 2003 won the Holmes Report ""Best PR Agency of the Year"" award. Producer Martin Kunert dismissed the accusations with, ""Are makers of SUV's, chocolates, and toothpaste hiring documentary filmmakers to propagandize the U.S. population?""

What the general public doesn't usually realize is just how much influence America's corporations (like the ones that were listed above) control have on our government representatives in Washington, through lobbying and close ties to our representatives. But that is another story for another day. My point was that the fact that those companies were employed the P.R. firm that handled the Army's P.R. matters didn't surprise me at all. If anything in only served to further raise my suspicions.

2. A look at the critics...

  * The San Francisco Chronicle wrote, ""'Voices of Iraq' is a must-see for anyone still coming to terms with the chaos in Iraq.""[5]
  * The Los Angeles Times, ""By turns heartbreaking, amusing and disturbing, the film features people from different regions, economic classes and religions, recounting stories that are sometimes bleak, sometimes encouraging, but always compelling""
  * Variety, ""In a season of political documentaries that take one side or the other on the war in Iraq, a film has emerged whose purpose is not to address American politics but the Iraqi people.""
  * Hollywood Reporter, ""Perhaps the sharpest commentary on years of suffering, hope and the wages of war are the children in front of and behind the cameras.""
  * The Wall Street Journal, ""At a time when shrill political diatribes dominate the documentary scene, along comes an authentic work that dares to let the subject speak for itself - literally.""
  * Dallas Morning News, ""An extraordinary, up-to-the-minute tapestry that ranges all over this country of 25 million people and carries the force of revelation.""
  * The Washington Times: ""'Voices of Iraq' is neither partisan nor conservative in any meaningful sense of the word. However, as an attempt to get behind the filter of the main stream media - as a picture of reality unmediated by editorial commentary - it's a more potent negation of Michael Moore, Craig Unger, Noam Chomsky and Co.""
  * The New York Times: ""If this film cannot claim to represent the political ""truth"" about the war - what film could?""

But questions too:

  * Variety: ""As a true or accurate portrait of the real Iraq, however, pic pales in comparison to various in-depth U.S. and European reports, and to Bahman Ghobadi's brilliant new drama on wartime Kurdish refugees, ""Turtles Can Fly.""""
  * The Village Voice: ""any film that credits itself as ""filmed and directed by the people of Iraq"" deserves to be regarded with skepticism.""
  * Detroit Free Press: ""a revealing documentary that depicts the day-to-day hopes and grief of people. Mothers talk about sons gone missing. Interviews are interrupted by bomb explosions. Kids practice in a rock band after listening to black-market Metallica CDs. The movie is disturbing, sometimes funny, and also timely.... Maybe my skepticism comes with the timing- the movie arrives just days before the presidential election.""

There seems to be a pattern when it comes to pro-Bush administration media (while this film was certainly not touted as such) that the books and movies what share this slant are eagerly reviewed by papers such as The Washington Times and The Wall Street Journal, both known to cater to the Bush administration's policies. While a book like Barrie Zwicker's ""Towers of Deception: The Media Cover-up of 9/11"" receives little or no coverage by the mainstream media. They won't touch it with a ten and a half foot pole...and for good reason, they'd have their senior editors and Ceo's of those media companies breathing down their neck to pull it.
Consider the following...

Concentration of media ownership (also known as media consolidation) is a commonly used term among those who are concerned that the majority of the media outlets are owned by a small number of conglomerates and corporations -- especially those who view such consolidation as detrimental, dangerous, or otherwise worrying -- to characterize ownership structure of mass media industries. These individual media industries are often referred to as a 'Media Institution'. Media ownership may refer to states of oligopoly or monopoly in a given media industry, or to the importance of a low number of media conglomerates. Large media conglomerates include Disney, National Amusements, Time Warner, Viacom, News Corp, Bertelsmann AG, Sony, General Electric, Vivendi SA and Lagardre Group.

For example, movie production is known to be dominated by major studios since the early 20th Century; before that, there was a period in which Edison's Trust monopolized the industry. The music and television industries recently witnessed cases of media consolidation, with Sony Music Entertainment's parent company merging their music division with Bertelsmann AG's BMG to form Sony BMG and TimeWarner's The WB and CBS Corp.'s UPN merging to form The CW. In the case of Sony BMG, there existed a ""Big Five"" (now ""Big Four"") of major record companies, while The CW's creation was an attempt to consolidate ratings and stand up to the ""Big Four"" of American network (terrestrial) television.

There may also be some large-scale owners in an industry that are not the causes of monopoly or oligopoly. Clear Channel Communications, especially since the Telecommunications Act of 1996, acquired many radio stations across the United States, and came to own more than 1,200 stations. However, the radio broadcasting industry in the United States and elsewhere can be regarded oligopolistic regardless of the existence of such a player. Because radio stations are local in reach, each licensed a specific part of airwave by the FCC in a specific local area, any local market is served by a limited number of stations. In most countries, this system of licensing makes many markets local oligopolies. The similar market structure exists for television broadcasting, cable systems and newspaper industries, all of which are characterized by the existence of large-scale owners. Concentration of ownership is often found in these industries.

For this we can in part thank the ""Golden Boy"" of the Republican's, Michael Powell... ""the chairman of the FCC, Powell led from his long-stated libertarian philosophy of deregulation of communications. Powell saw excessive regulation as stifling to technological innovation, and led the charge to open up markets in VoIP, Wi-Fi, and Broadband over Powerline (BPL).""

Did you catch the bit where General Motors was listed as a ""Large media conglomerate"" ?... Than you might also remember point 1 which referred to the fact the General Motors employed MS&L, the P.R. firm that is also employed by the Army"". I'd have to research this more to see if there is any connection, but I just found this to be interesting and a point worth looking into.

Some pretty big names in there... 20th Century Fox, Warner, Paramount, MTV... I think its safe to classify those under ""Large media conglomerates"".

So to sum up my thoughts, while I myself have not come to any absolute conclusions regarding the true origin and intent of this film, I think there are a lot of interesting connections that this film has with the Bush Administration and the government in general. Understanding how the media corporations work and just how close the ties are to our government, I think there is a good chance that this film was indeed at least influenced by the Bush Administration. Whether its a biased film or not, I think the eyes of the children in this film speak volumes after you strip away political medium that finally broadcast their faces onto our television sets back here in the United States. So in short, view this film with a discerning eye and let us not forget the Iraqis themselves who are caught up in all of this.",1199923200,,9704,5.177336747759283
8129040,4,B000G6BM1O,"I got this to use excerpts for a 7th grade geography class.  My 21-year-old daughter watched it with me when I previewed it, and was horrified at how graphic it was.  It shows lots of close-ups of dead bodies when talking about gassing the Kurds.  It shows some pretty overwhelming footage in the section on ""atrocities"" under Saddam.  It's horrible that children in Iraq are exposed to violence on a daily basis.  But to expose 7th graders here to those images is not solving anything.  I'm assuming this DVD was not intended for my 7th graders.  Also, I agree that this has a very ""pro-invasion"" slant.  But there are one or two milder excerpts I may still use with my students.",1168732800,,680,4.56198347107438
8129041,1,B000G6BM1O,"This film is a wolf in sheep's clothing.  It advertises itself as an objective presentation of the views of contemporary, average Iraqis as seen through their undirected use of 150 digital cameras distributed randomly by the film's creators. This is clearly not what the film is.  The beginning of the highly edited work does show some dissatisfaction with chaos and loss of life associated with the war, but the final four-fifths of the film slams home a cogent thesis that the American invasion has universally benefited all Iraqis and was the right choice by America's leadership.  The film uses much footage and other sources having nothing to do with the Iraqis filming themselves with the aforementioned video cameras to drive the thesis (examples include insurgent recruitment videos, footage depicting Saddam's regime's brutality, exerpting newspaper headlines) Extreme bias is evident as the editing bends over backwards to advance arguments resembling sundry, dubious pro-war Republican talking points including: Most Iraqis are now happy and better off than they were before (footage of Saddam's torture); the Abu Ghraib scandal is only an American scandal as it doesn't bother Iraqis; the media is to blame for focusing on the negative aspects of the war (juxtaposition of positive scenes with negative headlines from major newspapers-could the editing bias be any more apparent than here?); the insurgency is not comprised of Iraqis - it is a conspiracy of foreign states that would be harmed by a successful democratic model in Iraq; Saddam gave comfort and aid to Al Queda; America is widely appreciated by Iraqis; Iraqis do not view the war as one against Islam - in fact all the differing religious as well as ethnic factions are shown to exist in a state of mutual respect and harmony - even Iraqi Christians and women; etc. etc.

At best its simply a biased documentary that fails due to its deception under a pretense of objectivity.  At worst this is a GOP/Neo-Con propaganda film. I am not saying this is the actual case, but if the Bush administration was going to make a propaganda film, it might look quite a bit like this one. Also, look at the timing of the release; right before the 2004 presidential elections, and the PR for this film was handled by the same media firm that the US Army uses. Financing for the film may have ties to neo-con organizations also.  There are voices here...but not an unedited, smattering of Iraqi people, more like Rumsfeld, Cheney, and Rove.

Just some food for thought.",1149552000,13,2531,4.983412322274882
8129042,5,B000G6BM1O,"In a rather interesting idea, cameras were distributed all over Iraq. People filmed each other so we have a heaps of interviews of people with a wide range of views all spoke on the main issues that they faced such as their hopes for the future, terrorism, democracy and financial issues. Then someone put it together extremely well.

It all made for some quite fascinating viewing.",1146700800,5,382,4.787878787878788
8129043,1,B000G6BM1O,"Good idea, but this documentary comes off heavily edited. You could give me a 150 cameras and I could make you think there are no fish in the sea. Its very deceptive. Borderline propoganda. Its good viewing for those who want to feel good about themselves.

Perhaps the final blow... This documentary is obsolete. It was mostly shot during 2004, when things were still looking fairly promising. Its now 2006 and the looming civil war is threatening to throw Iraq into a spin.

This documentary is as premature as George Bush's 'The war has ended' speech. Perhaps thats why it hasn't been released properly.",1145664000,6,606,4.8173076923076925
8129044,5,B000G6BM1O,"This is a great movie if you want to hear another perspective aside from what you're hearing on the news. You watch CNN and hear what some journalist says the Iraqis think.  Now you can hear it from the Iraqis.  I'm here in Iraq as I write this. I'm in the freakin Sunni Triangle and I'm sorry everyody, this movie is pretty accurate. Hate to upset some of you conspiracy theorists who have written reviews but most Iraqis are pretty pro-American. I don't remember there only being a pro-American sentiment in the video though.

 The insurgents are a mixed group of malcontents, many of them are just street thugs.

 I can see how this video would upset some people though. It just doesn't jibe with what the media is saying. It's so contradictory of how the newspapers present things.

  I talk to the Iraqi people daily and this video isn't propoganda. Just like being here you feel like you can relate to these people on some level and get a sense of what's goin on over here. Definately watch!",1134950400,5,997,4.5251396648044695
