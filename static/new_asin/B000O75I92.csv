8183154,5,B000O75I92,Classic British comedy in interesting short-burst episode format that works really well. The series definitely better than the later movie.,1430006400,,139,6.0
8183155,5,B000O75I92,I remember the first time I saw this I could not believe my eyes or my ears. And this was just a couple of guys taking on so many different roles. I couldn't stop laughing. Classic hilarity. I'm sure it helped that I was living in London at the time and love British comedy and humor. Loved these characterizations.,1429747200,,315,4.3559322033898304
8183156,2,B000O75I92,"To say I was very disappointed in this show would be an understatement. Was everyone smoking crack when they made this? Horrible direction, terrible acting - that seems entirely improvised and unfunny - and photography that looks like the camera department was manned by blind two year olds who haven't yet learned how to walk. Repetitive and, in a word, s***. Don't waste your money on this just because it's supposedly ""British comedy"". It discredits all the amazing, genuinely creative British comedy shows that have come before and after it. Sorry I fell for it, but now you don't have to. Bollocks!",1383955200,,603,4.921568627450981
