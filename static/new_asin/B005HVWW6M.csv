4706711,3,B005HVWW6M,"I found it good for the overall geek needing to complete the collection deal but for actual quality, the dub voices where out on a hike. Sabat sounded like he just finished a DBZ ep. Cook and Burgmeier were the only two I found sounded like the original dubbing of the series. For the price, it should have been $20 for the lack of minutes overall.",1325721600,4,348,4.287878787878788
4706712,5,B005HVWW6M,"What you get in this set is basically the ""movie"" which is roughly 20 minutes, and some short clips (OVAs) and an short 10 minute episode or so with all the characters together again while the opening and ending themes play every 2-3 minutes, going through all of the endings and the two different versions of the opening theme, that is all on the first disc and is in English dub.

The movie is a little over 20 minutes like I said so its basically like an episode. I found the ""movie"" to be enjoyable but like this entire release I find it to be for true fans only and fans of the series. If someone were to randomly buy this set without viewing all/most of Yu Yu Hakusho the series I doubt they'd really enjoy it especially not knowing about the characters and all that. I loved that Funimation gathered the entire voice acting crew back together for this late final release, after I got done watching all of these clips it made me want to rewatch YYH completely all day but it also made me wish that there was more to the series.

The second disc is in its original Japanese language but does feature English subtitles by Funimation. So it kind of sucked that it wasn't all in English but its still a great thing to add to this release.

Overall I give this a 5/5 because I've been a fan of the series since childhood, almost 10 years now I've been watching Yu Yu Hakusho and this was a fantastic release on Funimation's part, I really couldn't ask for much more besides the second disc being in English too but Funi couldn't get the copyright rights to the music they said, so what can you do. Once again I say this is a hardcore fan release buy only.",1325289600,23,1656,4.301282051282051
4706713,5,B005HVWW6M,"As you see from the other 3 review you kind of get the idea of what to expect now if you pre-order or buy it now on Dvd so i don't think i need to say much info about it but i do however will give u little simple about each one and everything that this release.

Yu Yu hakusho:The movie-As the other explain to you that it's a 20-30 min clip of the gang trying to rescue Keoma Who the kidnappers need is a golden seal.
EIZOU Hakusho Ova- Which is some short clips of the gang before, and after the tv series ended (Like seeing Yusuke owning his ramen shop and him and his 3 friends at the 2nd demon tourment including kawabarwa) Very nice to watch some secret reveal that wasn't in the series.

Nightmare Hakusho-Another shory clips but this time it set in yusuke dream which i find it very creepy but very funny to watch.
Scenes from the Dark Tourment
Anti-piracy clips
YYH Opening and ending Enyclopedia which i found very enjoyable to have.

Textless Songs

Vintage trailer

And one more important thing. The Japanese dub are on Disc 2 and English (All cast are back!) dub is on disc 1, and as the last  reviewers said the due to lisencing issues or not getting the material funimation needed to dub the Songs (Theme song which each of the 4 main characters sing) into english so they left it in sub but i say it least it still including with this set.

For me, when i heard that this one was finally coming to the U.s.a. me and my friends couldn't be any happier as we pre-order our own copies and watch it together. I couldn't say anymore but thanks to what funimation has done from even picking up this awesome series and tanleted voice cast than what other companies would have done. So For that i give it 5 stars.  I for one can't wait for funimation does next and i hope they will redub the 2nd movie as well. Or else this 2-disc is a must have for almost any YYH fans!",1323993600,3,1878,4.211699164345404
4706714,4,B005HVWW6M,"Disc 1:
First, I'll explain what you are getting here. Yu Yu Hakusho the Golden Seal was a double-billed movie(alongside another anime series movie, Ninku) released in Japan, at a whopping 25 minutes. It even includes the opening and endings from the series so really it is about 20 minutes. Its widescreen and clearly has been remastered and is near the picture quality of the blu-ray series. The entire english dub cast has been reunited for all the new stuff in this release and it is the main reason that this movie was enjoyable at all. The movie itself is rushed and frankly terrible, but its good to see the band back together.

Next you get the extras from the eizou hakusho ovas(I'll explain those when I get to disc 2). They are basically all fanservice and non-essential whatsoever, except for the fact that they are also fully dubbed by the legendary english cast as well. The picture quality of these extras is vhs quality, most likely b/c thats what they were intended for was Japanese vhs releases, and the original film masters must have been lost or something. They ranged from amusing to meh.

 Then you get to the opening and ending encyclopedia extra, which was the best part of this entire set. It takes place AFTER the end of the series, and there really isn't any new development other than showing that Yusuke is running his own ramen stand, but if you are a fan, I guarentee you will love this extra. It made the entire set worth while.

Disc 2:
I can imagine in the early 90's in Japan, a vhs with a bunch of fight clips set to music sung by the actual characters would have been awesome. Now...ehh. This disc is only really cool because it has an original music video for each character with completely new animation. Theres also a few funimation trailers. That's it. :/

Theres really not as much here as Funimation would like you to think. (Unless you like watching grainy subbed recaps set to old Japanese music. Then maybe you'll watch for as many hours as they say.)You are really getting maybe an hour of new material if you are lucky. The First disc is awesome though, thanks to the new dub and the encyclopedia extra. As a huge yyh fan, I loved it, but don't expect anything crazy good.",1323648000,3,2221,4.5425
4706715,4,B005HVWW6M,"REVISED REVIEW

So, this product hasn't been listed very long.  Except for ""Golden Seal"" (which was previously dubbed by another company), I have not viewed this product in English.  All I can do for now is tell you what I know about the Japanese equivalent of this product.  I will update this review when I get more information.

THE MOVIE: GOLDEN SEAL

WARNING: You may have seen a Yu Yu Hakusho / Ninku double feature listed on Amazon.  DON'T BUY THAT VERSION.  That is the old version, dubbed by another company with different voice actors and less creative script writers.  As a result, it is almost universally considered awful.

--This is called a movie, but it's actually the same length as an episode from the TV series.  It even has the same opening and ending theme sequences (in this case it's the second season's ending theme, ""Sayonara Bye-Bye"").

--The plot is self-contained, so you won't have to watch another episode for the big conclusion.  The plot is pretty simple.  Koenma, Prince of the Spirit World, is kidnapped by a demon and a demigod with plans for (what else?) world domination.  A team is sent to rescue Koenma, led by Spirit Detective Yusuke Urameshi, a teenage zombie armed with a bad attitude and a fully-charged Spirit Gun.  Yusuke and friends are faced with traps, demon gangs, ensnaring forests, a valley of magma, and the kidnappers themselves--all in the space of less than half an hour.  The plot is very fast-paced and there isn't a whole lot of time set aside for character development, but some good script writing and acting can tell you everything you need to know about the characters without all the dramatic backstory included.  Actually, this movie could be a GREAT way to sample the series and see if it's something you want to watch all the way through.

--Since this movie had a higher budget than any episode of the TV series could hope to have, the art is of MUCH better quality than the original series.  The only problem you may experience with the visuals is the fact that this doesn't come in blu-ray.  That means that this probably has NOT been remastered, so you will notice a definite drop in video quality if you've watched the TV series on blu-ray.

--The original Japanese audio for this movie was in mono.  I don't know if this problem has been addressed.  The English audio, on the other hand, will be of exquisite quality since it was recorded within the past year or two.  If the script writer for this movie is the same as the writer for the TV series, we should be looking at something funny, witty and befitting of the characters (unlike the old English dub).  And, of course, Funimation has dubbed this movie, so the voices themselves will fit the characters much better.

EIZOU HAKUSHO

--First, we have music videos.  If I remember the Japanese version correctly, there are 3-4 songs for each of the four main characters, sung by their actors.  From what I understand, the English voice actors DID sing for their characters.  It should be interesting to see what kind of English lyrics they came up with.  The main attraction here will be to see whether or not Christopher Sabat can actually sing while using his Kuwabara voice!  An ear-splitting disaster?  Comic gold?  Or will he surprise us and actually be able to carry a tune?  EDIT: I have received information that, although the actors did start to record the songs in English, due to licensing issues the songs will have to remain in the original Japanese with English subtitles instead.  This is fairly disappointing if you were looking forward to hearing the songs in English, but the songs probably would have sounded better in Japanese anyway, so it's not a total loss.

--We also get bonus footage.  There were something like a dozen minute-long video clips animated after the series was complete.  You can look at these as deleted scenes for the TV series.  Some of them are based on scenes from the graphic novels, some were added in to tie up loose ends in the anime, and some were made just for fun.  I especially liked the bonus scene between Yukina and Hiei.  In short, these scenes can be interesting, but they're not essential to the series.  EDIT:  I watched a trailer for this product, and it seems I was mistaken--we are getting Mu Mu Hakusho instead of the bonus ending scenes I expected.  See below for details.

MU MU HAKUSHO

--Mu Mu Hakusho (sometimes called Yume Yume Hakusho) is a series of bizarre dreams Yusuke has, each about a minute long.  This is even less essential to the series than the bonus scenes I described above.  They have nothing to do with the plot and don't resolve anything, and I personally don't understand why they were made in the first place.  Mu Mu Hakusho is fine as a DVD extra, but it's definitely not the main attraction.

In light of the most recent information I have received, I am reducing my rating of this product from 5 to 4 stars.  The movie itself should still be good and I did like the Japanese music used in Eizou Hakusho, but the inclusion of Mu Mu instead of the other bonus scenes is disappointing and the lack of an English dub for the music videos is also a letdown.  I'll still buy it, but it's not as appealing as it was before.",1315872000,55,5232,4.617136659436008

4706730,4,B005HVWW6M,Love this show since it came on Toonami on cartoon network. This movie is good. Only I think the 2nd disc of this was a bit of a waste... The first disc was on point and loaded with decent extras. I was so pumped I couldn't wait to put in the 2nd disc. But then I was bummed cuz it was just clips of the show throughout seasons 1-4 and you can't even watch it in english. Really? It's like if I wanna watch clips of the show from the distant future perspective I'll just watch seasons 1-4 on dvd. First disc was good but the 2nd one was garbage.,1438732800,,545,3.963636363636364

4706732,4,B005HVWW6M,"Mere tablescraps from the series, but still worth watching... well, the first disk, anyway.  The second disk's just flashback stuff from the Dark Tournament and onward, and is only subtitled, not dubbed, and thus loses the personality FUNImation masterfully injected into the main series.

Calling the ""movie"" a ""movie"" is a bit laughable, though. it's only as long as your standard episode.  The more important stuff is wedged in between the clean openings and closings, and tells a bit more of the story, but with no indication that it exists without finding it yourself.  If you like the show as much as I did/do,  it's a decent buy, just don't expect too much from it.",1434844800,,672,4.808695652173913
4706733,3,B005HVWW6M,"This did indeed have a lot of extra stuff I had never seen before, including things in the original Japanese, but honestly the price didn't match the entertainment value.

I think this is just one of those things you but to make sure your collection is complete.",1429488000,,413,4.376623376623376
4706734,4,B005HVWW6M,"Okay, so I am a huge Yu Yu hakusho fan and I feel that it's a great dvd to understand the background of the characters and also all the extras from the Japanese and English. I honestly say the bad thing was it was short 25 minute movie but the plus was the bonus Eizou Hakusho shorts and the opening and closing encyclopedia that made me as a fan enjoy the series a lot more! My DVDs was a gift so seeing it with my friend we reminisced a lot during the movie. I also liked that they brought back the original dubbed voice actors, it made it feel like the show never ended and I am happy that it provided like 'closure' to what happened after Yu Yu Hakusho's series ended. So my rating would be 4/5 stars!",1426377600,,705,4.079136690647482

4706738,3,B005HVWW6M,"I recently purchased this movie for $20 and I honestly feel like it's not really a ""movie."" The movie you watch is roughly only about 20 minutes. The movie moves so fast that it feels like they rushed it, maybe. Sure, it was funny as hell but I feel like they should have implemented more scenes and actually take their take and slow things down. It has a great plot and story development in the movie but I feel like it moves way too fast. There are no other movies except for little short scripts that are so mind-boggling they are humorous. I loved them. It also bothers me when the character's voices are distinctively different than from the T.V. show. I don't know if it's just me but Kuwabara's voice is a bit different in this movie and it just doesn't have the same emotional effect as it did on the DVD seasons. Maybe he grew up and got a newer voice?",1423785600,,861,4.288343558282208

4706756,5,B005HVWW6M,"As an avid YYH fan I see this DVD as a must have.  The ""movie"" isn't bad, but feels more like a lost case file. The opening/ending encyclopedia is well worth it! In between songs are nice little scenes set a year after the series ending so you can catch up with the characters. The Nightmare clips ARE AMAZING. Have you ever wanted to see Hiei using the Jagan to cheat at being a door to door salesman? Well you should, and this is where you can see it. Also, don't skip the anti-piracy clips. :)

Overall, I was very pleased. The content was good, the discs where delivered quickly, and it was nice to see something new after all these years. Well worth it for the price.

Also, if you watched it in Japanese, the second disc will be really cool. :) It has a lot of old scenes set to songs written for the characters, with the voice actors singing it. Totes worth it.",1391040000,,868,4.216867469879518

Got this for Christmas, and definitely wasn't disappointed. Something very nostalgic about seeing several of these OVA's and quite satisfying too!

I was excited because this completed the collection for me however I was disappointed in the fact that the extras that come with the film were basically extra scenes of screaming and some dialogue for each character. Besides that fact I think if you're a fan of the series you'll enjoy it but may be slightly disappointed that there were not more significant features included.,1370822400,,584,4.416666666666667

Great addition to any fan, I love mine! Just, don't think it comes with the feature length film. It doesn't. Just the ""trailer"" episode ""movie."" :)",1361232000,,306,4.980392156862745

4706781,5,B005HVWW6M,"Eizou Hakusho and Yu Yu Hakusho The movie, have been elusive to  fans of the series and the Funimation English dub for years now. Stuck watching both online OR buying the dvd of The Movie from a different dubbing company (I actually liked the voices for that btw), it seemed that the OVA would never reach outside of Japan and that the movie wouldn't have the most familiar cast (the Funimation crew who dubbed the series).

The wait is over! Now compiled in this 2 disc set are the movie and Eizou Hakusho (the collection of shorts animations featuring the main characters). And it was awesome to pop it into the player for the first time.

Firstly, the dub was well done with matching words, true to character dialouge and over all smooth acting. Nice to hear these things without needing subtitles. The menus were laid out, everything was in order, it was just nice to have everything so nicely organized.

A bonus is that when on the second disc which includes character specific animations with character songs, they put the translations for the music being sung AND the title so that you may find them later if you wish.

Over all, if you are a fan of this series, this would definitely be for you! However, if you are a casual viewer not familiar with at least the mangas or original series, I wouldn't recommend it because of how specific it is, how odd some of the aspects of the shorts are, it wouldn't be as enjoyable for you. So all you Hakusho fans, we've waited a long while so pick this DVD set up while you have the chance because it was AWESOME!",1358812800,4,1562,4.466666666666667

I watched about 75 percent of everything on because I've seen some of the clips they put together when they were fighting in the Dark Tournoment and I don't really like to watch it in Japanese. Other than that it was awesome!!,1342224000,,293,4.25
4706788,3,B005HVWW6M,"With Yu Yu Hakusho having been released in its entirety in both DVD and Blu Ray formats, the only thing left for Funimation to do was release the movie and OVA. Even their ad campaign for this release hyped it up by telling buyers to complete their collection with this release... probably because there isn't really anything else positive you could say to sell it.

This release collects what are essentially the table scraps from the ever-so delicious main course that was the series, packaging the first movie from the series as well as a number of shorts--neither of which really add anything of real value to the main series itself. The movie is short, clocking in at 25 minutes and is your basic one-shot story with the heroes taking on a cookie-cutter villain with little to no emotional connection with any of the characters. It's neither horrible nor is it Emmy-winning gold; it's just your standard action anime movie from the early '90s with a basic plot of good vs. evil with my only gripe being that a majority of the film was spent racing to the bad guy's lair while fighting hordes of minions rather than fleshing out the villains to make me really hate them for the finale of the movie.

The remainder of the room on the first disc in this release consist of a short collection of old Funimation promos (interesting, though I would have preferred they get their hands on some of the Toonami and adult swim promos from back in the day) as well as the more substantial parts of what make up Eizou Hakusho--a collection of shorts that take place throughout the continuity of the main series. The first thing I noticed when watching through these shorts was the quality of everyone's voice acting in the English dub--particularly Justin Cook and Chuck Huber as Yusuke and Hiei, respectively. Cook's take on Yusuke is noticeably deeper than previously in some of the shorts, while Huber's tone as Hiei is missing the slight hint of malice, probably lost due to having voiced the comical father in Shin Chan as of late. As for the shorts themselves, they range in quality from the goofy nonsensical piece titled ""Nightmare Hakusho"" to a bit more relevant to the main series in the form of Koto interviewing the main cast before their fight with Team Toguro in the Dark Tournament as well as some bits that make up an epilogue of sorts. While it was interesting to see the origins of the group picture seen in the closing animation ""Sayonara Bye-Bye"" (a theme song that pops up multiple times throughout the first disc) as well as knowing that the kiss shared by Keiko and Yusuke at the series' finale was actually their second, the shorts as a whole don't exactly give off the same feel that the main series did for me and is only worth a watch or two just to say you watched them.

The first disc also includes a textless version of the movie's opening and ending theme (explaining why they're in widescreen rather than full screen). Normally, I wouldn't even bother mentioning this as an extra since Funimation tends to have these as standard for most of their releases. However, there's another section in the first disc's menu titled ""Opening and Ending Encyclopedia,"" collecting the opening and endings of the entire series in textless form in their right aspect ratio. The OP and ED Encyclopedia also collects a number of shorts, which I found rather misleading since one would just assume it to collect the opening and ending animations from the series and nothing more. There's also a cover of ""Sayonara Bye Bye"" by the English voice actress of Yukina, making for the song showing up a total of four times on this disc (at the end of the movie, textless form in 16:9 and 4:3 aspect, and now this cover). The last batch of extras on this first disc are some anti-piracy clips done in-character by the main cast (um... and Toguro, interestingly enough). Both the English and Japanese versions of these make reference to it being a while since last seen, which is an interesting point to note. The last parts of Eizou Hakusho were released in Japan on VHS in '96--a good two years after the final episode of the series aired in Japan in '94. Meanwhile, we get this release a whopping five years after the last episode aired in the US. Regardless of the language preference, I think most fans can agree that the success of this release relied heavily on nostalgic fans who wanted something new after all these years--no matter the quality, which brings me to the second disc.

While the contents of the first disc ranged in quality, practically everything found on the second disc was straightup garbage. We're presented with a clipshow from the main series, piecing together the individual stories of Yusuke, Kuwabara, Hiei, and Kurama. The picture quality is noticeably more washed out when comparing with the quality from the main series as released in Funimation's season sets (see comparisons in amazon's gallery of this release) which only further turns me off to its contents and for a while made me want to upgrade my collection of the main series from DVD to Blu Ray before I realized the problem was with this disc and not the rest of the series. The only real things of substance on the second disc would be the new animation sequences for each character. However, the picture quality is again a washed out VHS quality and can only be found after fast-forwarding through the clip show, which constantly reminds you that the series was made in the '90s, what with its cheesy karaoke-style scene transitions. This is only made more apparent in the parts on this disc that switch from clips from the show to still frame images that look like they were made by a grade schooler that just learned how to use Windows Movie Maker. The final nail in the coffin is the fact that absolutely nothing on this second disc has been dubbed in English--with the Japanese subbed version being the only option here. I find it odd that the original English cast would get together to dub all the other clips, but leave the ones on this second disc untouched. Listening to in-character songs by the English cast would have been a real hoot and honestly would have boosted up my view of this release significantly.

To sum things up, this release collects what should have probably been dispersed throughout Funimation's four season sets as extras. Listing everything out, there's a good amount of material, but the run time of each item is too short and even when collected together doesn't exactly warrant a single release, especially at the price being asked for. I personally paid $10 for this release, which I think as about as high up as anyone should be willing to go to to pay for this release.

As a side note, there is a second Yu Yu Hakusho movie that would truly complete your collection of the series.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yu-Yu-Hakusho-The-Movie-Poltergeist-Report/dp/B00070Q86I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yu Yu Hakusho: The Movie Poltergeist Report</a>&nbsp;was released by US Manga Corps which is probably why Funimation couldn't get their hands on it for this release. As such it's English dub is a completely different cast. Regardless, it's an interesting bit of YYH history, with really nice animation, that makes up for its lackluster story.",1330732800,12,7320,4.824044585987261
4706789,4,B005HVWW6M,"As a long-time YYH fan, I was incredibly excited to find that Funimation was releasing an English version of the Japanese OVA... but perhaps a little too excited.  Don't get me wrong, for the price, I was very entertained! ...with the first disc.  Very entertained with the first disk.  This included a humorous ""movie"" episode, and several humorous clips to amuse yourself with.  With the second disk however, I was disappointed because (a bulk of it) was nothing but a gathering of clips from the series (nothing new), and the character songs... sung by the Japanese voice actors D:
  So yes, I was under the assumption that the Funimation cast was going to be doing the voice-acting for the songs. Perhaps if I hadn't of thought that when I bought it, I wouldn't have been so disappointed. (Although I will say, the ending credit songs for the series were nice, especially the one they included which was sung by Yukina's voice actress.)

In conclusion, I do think this is a great buy for any fan.  The only reason I gave it four stars was because (at least for me) the second disk was a little droll, unless you are just a super fan of the Japanese voice actors.

...I honestly wish they would release more of this series </3",1329350400,,1229,4.575342465753424
4706790,5,B005HVWW6M,"I was so happy when I found out FUNimation was re-dubbing the first movie and the OVAs. It would have been wonderful if they also re-dubbed the second movie; it was much more popular than the first movie and I think they would get a lot more watchers/fans if they did.

FUNimation did an excellent job with the movie, though Kuwabara's voice is a bit off. I can understand that Christopher Sabat hasn't done the role in a long time but I'll still miss the old Kuwabara voice. ; w ; (Love Kurama as always! <3) I was pretty surprised when I heard Greg Ayres playing Koashura and I think he did good; he's usually good at playing children. :D

I have yet to see the OVAs, though, since I haven't had much time. However, I am looking forward to it! Great job, FUNimation! Keep up the good work! ovob",1329091200,,796,4.3
4706791,5,B005HVWW6M,The Yu Yu Hakusho OVA and First Movie are excellent.

8473836,3,B005HVWW6M,This is my favorite anime of all time and I was curious to see the OVAs in English after watching them in sub. My biggest problem with this and my reason for four stars is that there are several OVAs missing that for whatever reason Funimation didn't get (including Hiei revealing that he pretended to search for Yukina's brother which is a big deal because it gives more depth to that complicated relationship) and I'm wondering why you'd release an OVA if you didn't have all of them? I assume it couldn't have been an issue about rights. I wish Funimation would get all of them and re-release this. The price would be more reasonable then,1494028800,,641,4.5344827586206895

Funimmation, just grab the licenses for the 2nd movie. Re-release it with the original dub and a new dub from the original voice actors all on 1 blu ray disc. No kickstarter needed. Please and thank you!",1464825600,,543,3.9363636363636365
