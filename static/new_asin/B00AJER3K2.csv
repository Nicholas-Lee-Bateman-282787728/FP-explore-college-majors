5440326,5,B00AJER3K2,This is a fun look back over 30 years ago on Ronald Reagan's Presidency. Its Amazing how the policy's of back then still apply to today's issues. this video shows how we beat the Evil Empire by making them spend money they did not have to end the cold war. This also shows how Reagan was a great communicator with his back ground in Acting and radio when you see any President give a speech shows they are not like Reagan. Fun look back at History at a great President that made the 80s.,1390953600,,487,4.191489361702128
5440327,2,B00AJER3K2,This is more a critique of Ronald Reagan than anything else.  Everything is from the perspective of liberal politicians and nothing from the other side at all.  How can Robert Reich make a statement that the economy was boosted by military spending and not tax cuts and there be no rebuttal?  How would anyone even know?,1390521600,21,320,4.678571428571429
5440328,5,B00AJER3K2,"They interview both Democrats and Republicans (liberal, conservative, and moderate) who provide a balanced presentation of Reagan. That is, they present important moments from his presidency with commentary that offers both praise and criticism, sometimes on the same issue. I am not sure why others would claim that this documentary series is anti-Reagan. It does not fall into either naive sentimentality or shallow demonization, which perhaps is what people from fringe groups like the Tea Party or Occupy Wall Street would want. Balance is important because history is not as easy to interpret as most people assume. For instance, deciphering the cause of economic booms and busts during his presidency is not clear-cut, so any documentary that tried to present a clear cause for them would be ideologically biased and, therefore, unreliable.",1390348800,4,846,5.416666666666667
5440329,1,B00AJER3K2,"Would it have killed the makers of this film to have at least one conservative person interviewed on this film and not just liberal politicians like Gary Heart, Walter Mondale and Robert Reich. And would it have killed you to put reagans presidency in the proper context in history and not just rehash a crap load of old liberal clichas. P.S. Reagan never raised income taxes, his tax cut program did not take effect yet when tip o'neal and RINO republicans like Bob Dole pressured him into readjusting his tax cut rates a year before they went into effect.",1388361600,17,557,4.636363636363637
5440330,5,B00AJER3K2,"Even though it has become highly unpopular - productive political criticism hasn't died (yet), thanks to PBS. A public political figure like a (U.S.) president, must always be seen and evaluated from several points of view.
A well-balanced, sensitively evaluated, and attentively researched look into our all future is neither openly greeted nor well digested among American people. FAST and eagerly EMOTIONAL generalizations rotate inside the U.S. universe as if other countries just existed to be convinced of the American way.
An excellent documentary, especially for people who listen without judging, hopefully, our all young generations. In the end, only history will have told the truth.",1365292800,4,694,5.556603773584905
5440331,4,B00AJER3K2,This DVD is very informative and one you will want to watch and share with others.  I would recommend it!,1363305600,,105,4.25
5440332,2,B00AJER3K2,"Let's face it, asking PBS to create an unbiased overview of President Reagan's time in office is like asking a fox to critically appraise chicken coop security.  This DVD is miserly in its appreciation of Reagan's accomplishments and spins history to support current, left wing political dynamics.  I would view it as a rewrite of history to support the massive expansion of government that he most opposed.",1362873600,34,407,5.059701492537314
5440343,4,B00AJER3K2,I give him credit for helping to bankrupt the soviet union and causing it to collapse. He took the focus off of corporations and put it on the government which I disagree with. He preached to us that taxes are bad and corporations are good which again I disagree with. Government became more secretive and less accessible to American citizens.,1404000000,,343,4.733333333333333
5440344,5,B00AJER3K2,The series so far has been good. It covers all the bases. Good and Bad. Including the tax hikes and the fallout of Foriegn policy,1402531200,,129,4.2
5440345,1,B00AJER3K2,"Everyone interviewed was a Democrat and treated as if they were the authority.

Veto proof congressional budgets were not discussed.  Interviewing Richard Reich as a Reagan commentator was the final straw.

This video is pure propaganda for the left.",1401840000,6,250,5.358974358974359
5440346,5,B00AJER3K2,"There is a lot of information I have forgotten about regarding the Reagan era.  I was too busy building a career and raising a family to care about anything except getting Carter out of the White House.  It is an interesting note that some of Reagan's taxing and budget policies that failed him worked-out well for Clinton.  While not quite the hero many think him to be, he was a relief from his predecessor and put the USA on a path to recovery albeit with a bit of pain before the healing.  Good documentary.",1399507200,,511,4.404255319148936
5440347,1,B00AJER3K2,"I grew up after the Reagan era and I have very little for or against the man, but upon watching the first half of the first episode of this documentary, I had to stop. If you're looking for an honest pro and con inspection of the Reagan years, this is not at all what you're looking for. Almost every single one of the talking heads is a Democratic politician, cabinet official, and/or pundit or journalist who very much come across as having an axe to grind. Even more so, the Democrats aren't even people who served at the time he was president. Why the hell do I care what Bill Clinton's Labor Secretary has to say about Ronald Reagan's policies??

I'm enough of a student of history to know that Reagan managed to win 49/50 states in 1984 and be hugely popular throughout much of his own time in office and afterward. He radically altered the debates being had in the country and turned conservatism into a powerful political movement that we're still interacting with today. An honest-to-God documentary would honestly explore how he managed that. But this documentary would make you think that the entire presidency was an accident, the American people were utterly fooled by a racist dope who had no concept of his own policies, and that it was by sheer luck (or accidental liberal policies being enacted) that anything good happened for Reagan. Total cognitive dissonance.

Very, very disappointing. Especially after watching the ""Clinton"" documentary which is pretty even-handed about Clinton's foibles and successes and well worth the time.

There's so much great stuff that PBS has made, but this is a waste of time and money. Go watch Ken Burns's ""The Civil War"" or something like that instead.",1398988800,39,1706,4.815699658703072
5440348,4,B00AJER3K2,"While I lived through the Reagan years, I was too young and ignorant to care about the politics of those years.  Even though I have only watched the first episode, I am glad for this series for documenting some of that era.  However, now that I am older and wide awake to the current administration and all of its politics, I can see that history repeats itself constantly.  Nothing ever changes unless you purposely set out to make it change.  Some have done that and made those changes  behind closed doors and have kept them covered up so no one would find out because they changed it, not to make it better, but to fit their agenda...even if it made it worse; and this current administration is guilty of doing that. But in order to make it change for the better you have to bring it out into the open.  Give it the ""test of fire"" by exposing it to the light and the truth.  When that happens it begins to take a turn for the better.  This series shows Reagan's decisions, either good or bad, coming to light.  You decide for yourself if they turned out for the better and changed history for the common good.",1396656000,,1113,4.338164251207729
5440349,1,B00AJER3K2,Very bias against REAGAN. Why so many liberals evaluating REAGAN? Do not bother with this inaccurate piece of propaganda. Find the documentary showing REAGAN meeting with Gorbachev at Reykjavik and you will see what a true leader this man was.,1394236800,7,243,5.1
5440350,2,B00AJER3K2,"As usual, the bias in the direction of those supposedly well-meaning, politicians know best, and govt is here to help attitudes and (possibly even genuine) beliefs is prevalent throughout. But, even so, the challenges and positive outcomes are, for the most part, at least presented. Some people will probably find it completely incredible that in less than four years, an economy that was in far worse condition nationally than it was in 2008, was turned around by the policies of this supposed dunce. As for the positive flip in the morale of the country, and the deliberate end of the cold war, these things would be difficult to convey without the authors and producers being criticised as hagiographers. (And they would never stoop so low - except when portraying someone they agreed with)",1393977600,5,794,4.977443609022556
5440351,2,B00AJER3K2,"Almost of of the talking heads are Democrat/liberals. Who could ever think Robert Reich is one of Ronald Reagan
 admirers. The facts are given but there is a lack of conservative voices. But why be surprised it is produced by PBS.",1391990400,20,230,4.609756097560975
5440352,2,B00AJER3K2,"Production Value: 3/5
Historical Accuracy: 1/5

This documentary in the first half keeps making you think it might be a fair handed and not try to grind a political axe. But after about half an hour, it's all downhill from there and the gloves come off. Becomes totally unwatchable, the bias and spin gets out of hand. They couldn't even get the Iran hostage crisis right and that was before he became President. This is a far left historical rewrite. Look elsewhere for facts.",1391990400,14,477,4.678571428571429

8552614,3,B00AJER3K2,"And where did all of those so-called jobs eventually go? Oh, that's right (pun intended), CHINA! And most of our farmland? To corporations getting tax incentives!

Short-sighted, Mr. President, just like your clobbering of your mid-Sacramento neighborhood into which you demanded to move (personal notation).

8552620,3,B00AJER3K2,"This is an extremely topical summary of the Reagan presidency and most likely would be enjoyed by those who prefer to deify him. The American Experience did a nice four-hour documentary on the entirety of Reagan's life back in 1997 and I'd argue that their coverage of his presidency was more in-depth despite over two hours being devoted to his life through the governorship.

Because a preponderance of his cabinet is now deceased (George Shultz does appear), it is difficult to find people who were in the White House with Reagan. Kiron Skinner, who has compiled books of Reagan's writings and radio addresses, appears a great deal, as does the historian Douglas Brinkley, who redacted his diaries.

If you know a great deal about Reagan, you will most likely be bored by the facile analyses presented here. Even someone as erudite as Condoleeza Rice adds little insight to the proceedings.

While I'd argue the Home of Bill Moyers is never going to produce a Reagan documentary which would assuage the likes of Grover Norquist, they make sure ""in the name of fairness"" to make sure Reagan gets knocked as much as he is praised. I'd also argue that some of the economic analyses are false. But you are damned if you do and damned if you don't on this one.

For people who are old hands with Reagan, there is one fascinating tidbit in this whole thing: Russian analyses on Reagan's actions. It is worth it just to hear what they thought of his Brandenburg Gate speech. With the declassification of Soviet documents and academics, diplomats, and historians being able to speak their mind or tell the truth, ""the other side of the story"" is given some time, albeit too little. A better documentary could be made just presenting the Reagan years from the Soviet perspective.",1407196800,,1773,4.784313725490196
