8314299,3,B000X9LTGM,"This is a gorgeous production of an unknown, (to me at least), opera.  The stage sets and costuming are lush, the voices are lovely and the music wonderful.  However, it's based, we are told, on an old Thai legend, but we're given no synopsis and, although the singing is in English, one can not understand much of it.  This fact and the lack of English subtitles results in making the opera basically unavailable to most people - certainly to myself and my family.  What a shame!!!!  There's another opera by Somtow which has the same problem, but there at least, based on a more available Indian legend and with a synopsis, it was a bit more enjoyable, though in my opinion both are in dire need of subtitles.",1208736000,,711,4.5234375
