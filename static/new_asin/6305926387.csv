7898485,5,6305926387,"This movie has a great storyline. It features a genuine family unit, not your typical Hollywood lies. I loved its authenticity.",1393372800,,127,5.095238095238095
7898486,5,6305926387,This is one of our favorite movies and we were happy to find it on DVD.  Great family story but not the typical American happy family.,1355011200,,134,4.153846153846154
7898487,5,6305926387,"If you liked Muriel's Wedding then you will [probably] like this movie; if you like stories about dysfunctional Australian families, then you will [most likely] LOVE this movie.  Funny, sad, a little over-acted [at times], but always very, very human.  It's absolutely criminal that it is only available on VHS.

7898488,3,6305926387,"A story of a family united with passing away mother's last days depicted from rather tragic satiric viewpoint of adults behaving themselves as kids again in a place they hardly come any more.

It differs distinctively from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Savages/dp/B0014GI6I2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Savages</a>&nbsp;for comedy line I personally did not get properly.",1243382400,,422,7.612244897959184
7898489,5,6305926387,"This is one of the most touching films I have ever seen.  I saw it years ago and it has haunted me ever since.  The characters are flawed, and often not very likeable, but the acting is so skillfull that you find yourself drawn into the narrative anyway. It is desperately sad but never mawkish and funny in a way that makes you ache for them all.

I can't recommend this highly enough.  If you enjoyed Whalerider, you'll appreciate this movie.",1151971200,,444,4.444444444444445
7898490,5,6305926387,"I chose this video not really knowing what to expect, and was very glad I had.  This story of a dysfunctional family gathering together as their wife and mother prepares to die captivated me from the start.  Andreef realistically and humourously depicts the way mother Patsy and her family try to come to terms with her impending death and with their troubled relationships with each other.  Each of the characters comes across as flawed but very human.  Russell Dykstra gives a standout performance as the likeable ex-con son Bo.  With the help of Bo, Patsy quietly asserts her right to spend her last days the way she wants, while her daughters try in vain to keep her safely in bed.  To sum ... funny, moving, and real.",1011398400,2,722,4.645669291338582
7898491,4,6305926387,"This film reminded me a bit of the also excellent Jane Campion movie ""Sweetie"". The family here is made up of three overweight bickering sisters,an endearing substance abusing brother, a strange father who enjoys shooting birds out of trees for unclear reasons, and a dying mother.
The character of the mother is the most interesting, from her admiration of Jackie O., to her bond with her wild son. The best sequence in the film has the son taking his mother to the beach where both binge on morphine and feel alive. Beautiful.
Well drawn charecters, beautiful Australian scenery, and some very funny moments combine to make this a must see.",984268800,3,642,4.845454545454546
7898492,4,6305926387,"Sans the spit and polish of Hollywood cinema, this film is both humorous and poignant.  A really good story, and those, unfortunately, are often hard to come by.  I thought the writing and directing were wonderful and the cast exceptional.  The brother/son and sister Rita are stand-outs.  If you like Spitfire Grill, Northern Exposure, Britcoms, or Waking Ned Devine, you'll love it; I sure did.",975283200,5,396,5.046153846153846
