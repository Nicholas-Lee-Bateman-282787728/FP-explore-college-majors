When I came upon this video I couldn't believe Sarafina was in my loving room. This was how I learned about the turmoil going on in South Africa. I have never seen another Broadway show that compares to the Broadway production of Sarafina. I wonder too, why the South African government allowed this cast to travel out of South Africa to the United States to tell their story to a Broadway audience.",1386979200,,514,4.537634408602151
8355666,5,6301883055,"I was lucky to catch a showing of VOICES OF SARAFINA on PBS many years ago. Needless to say, the Acting, Directing and Music amazed me. Several years went by and I was taken, for my birthday, to the play in Los Angeles. I sat in the front row, tears in my eyes for the most part. I did not sleep for 3 nights my mind was so buzzing with awe. That first night I got up in the middle of the night and sent a letter to the theater to give to the Director. I never did hear back. The next week I decided to return to see it again. When I called for a ticket, the play had finsished its run at the theater. It was the best thing I did that year, other than my vacation to S.E. Asia! Thank you cast and crew!!! I will never forget the emotions that were stirred inside me. I highly recommend this Musical. I found it much better than the Movie.

8355667,5,6301883055,I saw this video in 1988 on TV and recorded it on on my Beta. Don't laugh...I knew I would want to watch it again and share it with my children and now I can share it with my grandchildren. It has a message that is expressed in a delightfully entertaining way. I am having it transferred onto DVD. The Music is wonderful and fun. The seller (Eric) from PA was great in processing and shipping my order and then following up with an email to ask about my satisfaction. I am very happy!!!!,1325203200,,487,4.191489361702128
