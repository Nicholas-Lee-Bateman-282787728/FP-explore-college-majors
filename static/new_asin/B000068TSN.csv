7964803,5,B000068TSN,"My 3 year old son is a diehard Dora fan.  Recently he really started to pick up on the few Spanish words they have on the English DVDs and the television show.  He was very excited to watch this video.  I think it holds his attention even more than the others - and his Spanish is skyrocketing.  I wish the character's voices weren't so high pitched (seems to always happen in Spanish speaking programs - all of the children have high voices) and that they spoke a little slower.  But if your child watches Dora over and over, why not add a little Spanish?",1108684800,10,556,4.3076923076923075
