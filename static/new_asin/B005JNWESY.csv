This training video is excellent in showing safe overtaking & passing on intermittently blind roads, & a superb demonstration of higher speed motorcycle handling on winding roads & blind curves.

The DVD is a good addition for anyone's riding collection, & will impart a good deal of basic & advanced information to beginners & seasoned riders as well.

Delivery of disc from England was super fast-----faster than many things i order from Amazon sellers in the USA. The video arrived exactly one week after i ordered it.

One reviewer referred to ""dated""---& i can only guess he is referring to the vintage of the bikes. I ride a mid-1990s BMW touring K model & thought all the bikes shown were certainly newer looking than mine. Regardless, proper bike handling is dateless.

The narrator's voice is British & I found his accent quite infectious and his words reasonably easy to understand.

This video primarily deals with bike handling on curvy roads..... & discusses and shows it with great emphasis.

It is quite easy to always ride a motorcycle in a straight line at any speed, but knowing how to corner and handle curves and regulate speed accordingly is for me the single most important aspect of riding safely. Curves are where it is most easy to go out of control and seriously injure yourself or your bike.

One thing some viewers need to be aware of is that the video is made on English back highways, mainly two-lane, narrow roads with high hedgerows growing close to the roadsides. Because it is England, the riding is done on the opposite side of the road from the USA. However, the bike handling is the same, regardless of which side of the road one drives on.

Video quality varies. This is a one hour 15 minute demonstration, largely concerned with high & medium speed motorcycle handling on curving roads, which is the most exciting and dangerous aspect of riding (besides center-lining or lane-splitting, which is sensibly done at much lower speeds thus presenting less danger of fatal injury in an accident).

Compared with the first 50 minutes, the last 25 minutes of the piece was both repetitious & unnecessary, i feel, as well as the image & sound being inferior to the earlier 2/3rd. But those first 50 minutes are well worth the cost of the video, & the best demonstration of curve & windy road handling i've seen.

The technique of predicting the severity of a hidden curve is shown repeatedly & in detail, how one can sight ahead & determine the curve by how fast the opposite side reveals itself depending on the angle of the curve. It is called ""view-point"".

The narrator, Mr. Waite, also talks about concentration----I call it being 100% focused on riding.....as I explained to my daughters military fianc, the same as if he were out in the field with the possibility of enemy snipers ready to shoot him......so one is constantly scanning everywhere, aware the tiniest movement or nuance.....which I first learned from riding in NYC....watching the movement of anyone inside a vehicle along the streets, to check if they might suddenly thrust open a door or pull out into my lane.. the movement of a vehicle in front of me if they drifted one way or the other, as if they might suddenly turn in front of me without signalling.

A good rule is simply never to drive too fast on any road you not already familiar with.

Here, it is best to be spotting where I want to be on the road as I take a curve & know that Im nearly always going to be a bit inside of that spot..... but while curves are often open-view on one side, half the time we encounter the hidden on a windy road.....& the idea of the 'view-point' reference calculation can be very helpful.

In sum, this a great guide for motorbike handling on curvy roads, especially for anyone wanting to go out on their bike & 'fly'. Thank you for reading.
