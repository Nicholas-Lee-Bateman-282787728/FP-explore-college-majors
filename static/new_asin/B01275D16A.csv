7343249,5,B01275D16A,This film deserves 5 stars for exposing the mess that is our southern border. It is a compelling and well done documentary. It is truly sad what the Mexican people are enduring and how disgusting it is that our government in the US chooses to ignore its constitutional duty to protect our border from invasion. It truly is a fallen world and this film illustrates how rare it is to find a true hero and the difficulties and hardships of a hero's path. Kudos to the brave selfless volunteers of the Arizona Border Recon.,1443744000,,519,4.531914893617022
7343250,4,B01275D16A,"""Cartel Land"" (2015 release; 100 min.) is a documentary that examines what is happening in the Mexican state of Michoacn, in south-west Mexico (about 1,000 miles from the US border), and in a separate story, we also take a look at what some people are doing at the Arizona border with Mexico. As the documentary opens, we see Mexican guys cooking up meth somewhere in Michoacn. Comments one: ""We know we do harm, but we come from poverty"". Then we get to know a woman, who lost 13 (!) family members, all brutally murdered by the cartel when their employer (owner of a lime orchard) couldn't pay the cartel, so they shot his employees as revenge. Then we get to know Dr. Mireles, a Michoacn-based physician who is sick and tired of the violence, and realizing that the official authorities will not/cannot do anything, he decides to start the Autodefensas, a grass roots movement to claim back the streets and towns of Michoacn.

Couple of comments: first, this is another documentary from producer-director Matthew Heineman, and with this latest, he hits the bull's eye. The situation in the Mexican state of Michoacn is so bad that people are outright desperate for relief, ANY relief. There is an astonishing scene that plays out in the city of Apo, where the Autodefensas capture several cartel members. Then the Mexican Army comes sweeping in, and tries to disarm the Autodefensas (yes! not the cartel). The town's population quickly gathers and essentially howls the Army back out of town. Jaw-dropping. There are other such scenes in this riveting, and revolting, documentary. With revolting, I refer of course to the deplorable situation the Mexican people find themselves in, left to their own devices with the state or federal authorities pretty much absent. Beware, on several occasions there is shocking footage and pictures, and this documentary is most certainly not for the faint of heart. Second, the 'parallel' story of the Arizona Border Recon, with veterans taking it on themselves to patrol the border to keep migrants out, falls utterly short and frankly looks a bit silly as compared to the stuff we see happening in Michoacn. It would've made the documentary even better by simply focusing on what is happening on the ground in Mexico. But even with that unnecessary side story, ""Cartel Land"" is an unforgettable documentary.

""Cartel Land"" made quite a splash at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, and when out of the blue this showed up at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this weekend, I couldn't believe my luck and went to see it right away. The matinee screening where I saw this at was a private affair, as in: I literally was the only person in the theater. That is a darn shame, as ""Cartel Land"" makes for compelling, if at times uncomfortable, viewing. If you get an opportunity to check this out and draw your own conclusions, be it at the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, do not miss it! ""Cartel Land"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1442793600,35,3014,4.8732943469785575
7343251,5,B01275D16A,"This is a great documentary.  It shows via graphic on-scene video detail and personal interviews of both Mexican and USA vigilantes how both the Mexican and USA governments are complicit in allowing the Mexican drug cartels to dominate the USA/Mexican border areas so the cartels can import drugs, criminal illegals and murder into the USA.  Of course the murders of innocents by the cartels is even worse in Mexico, but even so 3,000+ people in Texas alone have been murdered so far by criminal illegals that the cartels import and our government welcomes without background checks.  One negative is that the DVD I saw had Spanish CC but not English CC.",1439769600,3,654,4.873873873873874

7343279,5,B01275D16A,"I thought this was a very interesting documentary/biopic about a Mexican doctor who wanted to reclaim his state (Michoacan) from the cartels.  His was a grass-roots effort, an attempt to disrupt the cartels' subsidiary activities such as extortion and murder.

The movie ends ambivalently, picturing Mireles as a man who succumbed to money and women and who became, in his own way, just as murderous as the cartels.  Perhaps he was.  But one wonders: could he possibly have been just as corrupt as the Policia Nacional?  Could he been as adulterous as the cartels' barons?  Could he possibly have murdered one-twentieth of the people that the cartels took out?

I really enjoyed this movie, even though the ending as very ambivalent and required some thinking-through",1474848000,5,767,5.088

7343289,4,B01275D16A,"Very well-made documentary on the Mexican drug cartels and the armed groups who fight them. Wonderful cinematography.

It explores the deteriorating law & order situation in Mexico and in the U.S. on a personal level of the people involved on both sides. However, it remains totally superficial and subjective in that It never delves into the causes of the problem, nor does it offer any solutions.

The Mexican self-deense group comes across as courageous, engaging vicious drug gangs in desperate firefights. But the U.S. vigilante comes off as a standard wild west reactionary who uses the border situation to give meaning to a wasted life. Surrounded by blatantly racist flunkies, he constantly justifies himself, complaining about drug gangs on the border but never seems to be able to find any.

The tragic dilemma is articulated by a Mexican man who makes a passionate appeal to the vigilantes, pointing out that the only wise course is to get organized and force the civil authorities to take decisive action, because it they take the law into their own hands then society disintegrates into chaos. The U.S. vigilante doesn't seem capable of that kind of reasoning, typically blaming the problem on the government after denying the government the resources to deal with it.

But nowhere in the film is there any attempt to really get to the bottom of why the situation exists in the first place. In fact, the only truly objective voice is that of the meth cooker who freely admits that everyone on both sides of the situation is hopelessly corrupt, including himself.

Unfortunately, the take home here is that there may be no practical solution, at least at the moment. More guns only create a warlord society where more innocent people get killed in the crossfire. And all the experts agree that a continuous wall is economically impossible, costing hundreds of billions of dollars, and that even if it could be built, it wouldn't work anyway.

7343293,3,B01275D16A,"This is a documentary about life in respect to the Mexican drug cartels.
The story is two fold. The main story is that of a Mexican doctor, Dr. Jose Mireles, that tries to organize
popular armed defense forces for the various villages in the state of Michoacn. Through his efforts and
his fight we can see the grotesque and extremely violent life of the people in parts of Mexico. It is a brutal
life, and those that want to resist evil seem to descend into evil themselves in order to stay free.

On the other hand, we have the simplistic representation of USA citizens that have organised border patrols
in order to fend off criminal activity coming from Mexico. The main character here is a troubled, yet really
photogenic, blue eyed man named Tim Nailer Foley. Although the point the people like him are not always crazy
or racist, there is no real conversation here, no in depth look of that is going on on the USA side of the border.

What is really evident is the incompetence of the governments on both sides! Maybe because the status quo
serves them both, they are portrayed as absent, and in the case of Mexico corrupt, so much so that they
can corrupt even people with good intentions.

Having watch the news and a couple documentaries on the subject do not make me an expert on the drug
cartel wars in Mexico. Still, this documentary did not add something to my knowledge of things, although
it introduce me to the notion that people want to actively fight the cartels.
For those that have no information on the issue, it is a really hard knock in the stomach, and there are
some really violent scenes that add to that feeling.

This is a must watch documentary, especially if you are a USA citizen living far from the borders, since
it might help you understand how violence and drug trafficking are metastasized in USA cities",1467158400,,1839,4.546827794561934

The action packed documentary Cartel Land is very powerful and inciting.
  Overall I would recommend this documentary to mature audiences who want to catch a glimpse into the drug war happening in Mexico. The film is not the typical documentary in the sense that there were almost no facts or interviews, it feels more like an action film than a documentary.

The answer to immigration isn't building a big wall, but building a big wall with many doors that allows fully vetted citizens of both countries to freely cross the border that intend on making both our countries a BETTER place to visit and live in (Both America and Mexico are beautiful countries...Lets figure this out!)",1457395200,,532,4.782608695652174
7343326,4,B01275D16A,"Cartel Land begs the answer: are vigilantes just dressed-up bad guys?

On one side of the border, you have your prototypical militia-like group.  They consist of disenchanted, angry white men led by Tim Foley, a recovering addict who was victimized by his father growing up.  The group realize that ""illegals"" aren't the problem, so they shifted their focus on the violent drug cartels, who wreak havoc in Mexico and in US border towns.  Instead of focusing solely on the cartels, the group scapegoats ""the illegals taking money under the table,"" which makes their attempts at border control less heroic.

In Michaocan, Mexico you have Dr. Jose Mireles and his roving band of Autodefencias.  Feeling that the government is complicit with the cartel's criminal activities, Dr. Mireles and a group of middle-aged men take up arms to defend their communities.  As the group establishes itself, it's clear that Autidefencias is looking more like criminals than crime fighters.  This becomes more apparent when the Autodefencias become ""legalized"" by the Mexican government, complete with uniforms and all.  What better way to keep doing the dirt without the government harassing you? Pretend to be the good guys!

In reality, both groups are bad guys who have deluded themselves into thinking they are doing good.  Both groups are outnumbered, outgunned, and outsmarted.  The cartels don't play around, and won't think twice about cutting off your grandmother's head for the world to see.  Both groups neglect the real issues plaguinging their communities, and aren't really helping their respective causes. One bystander said ""we have the government to protect us."" Unfortunately,  he's putting too much faith in a government that is on the cartel's payroll.  Vigilantism makes it too easy to become a criminal, or someone that's a pretty shady character.  For all his Billy Jack swagger, Dr. Mirales was nothing more than a self-serving philanderer,  buying into the hype more so than fighting the cartels.

Overall a good documentary about how hard it is to be ""one of the good guys"" in cartel land, and how dangerous it is to live there.",1457136000,,2137,5.127167630057803

Moreover, the immigration from Central America, both illegal and legal, has always been interesting to me. This movie gives a really interesting contrast between the Mexican and American perceptions of immigration as well as the drug cartels. The American perspective is very complex and I think this documentary does a nice job accurately showing the feelings of mainly white Americans and their fears of illegal immigration. However, if these fears and concerns of illegal immigration are legitimate, that's up to you to decide. Lastly, the Mexican response to drug cartels is fascinating and you can see the corruption first-hand. The main take away from this movie was that people are innocent until proven guilty, and everyone deserves a fair trial.

7343353,3,B01275D16A,"I have just finished watching this documentary and I must say I am deeply disturbed and worried by it. The events depicted show not one but two countries disintegrating under the pressure of various devastatingly stupid policies. The US has been a major player in enforcing drug policy and the way it has pursued this end has undermined democratic processes south of the US Mexican border and empowered criminal gangs, the so-called ""cartels"" which consist at the highest levels of corrupt politicians and members of the police and armed forces, at the rank of foot soldiers of desperate, disaffected, uneducated and unemployed young men who, brutalized from the violence and injustice that surround them are willing to do anything to stay alive.

In addition, the US is the major manufacturer and provider of high power weapons and ammunition that have flooded south of the border but that are also all too easily available in the USA. As a consequence, vigilantism combined with racism and fear or hatred of foreigners has led to the founding of numerous military style outfits who police the border and are all too easily drawn into the violence and corruption. Tot for tat killings and erosion of justice and human rights are a consequence.

While many viewers will sympathise what this documentary demonstrates is not only a complete collapse of the authority of the state and the government, their inability to protect civilians from the consequences of their failed policies, but a profound lack of political insight: the militiamen depicted show little understanding of the economic and political grounds for the chaos they are experiencing and contributing to. Thus, whereas in Chiapas a popular uprising appears to have forced the Mexican government to stand down, elsewhere in Mexico, vigilantism breeds no broad popular movement for justice. Its proponents are the bourgeousie, anxious to protect their homes, shops and businesses where government has clearly failed. But their actions foster no political action: they adopt the methods of their opponents and thus become part of the problem. And governments, faced with a growing lack of control, have no other option than to up the ante and bring in heavier guns, more repression, and so on.

It appears that the documentary makers were either unconcerned with the economic and political causes of the violence, or may even be concerned with conveying a hopeless image of a country out of control because that is, after all, what proponents of the fencing off of the Mexican border want to justify the expenditure. Shocking, but also embarrassing that we should be witnessing the collapse of civil society on both sides of the border at a time when cooperation is so crucial.",1454803200,4,2739,5.095768374164811

7343355,5,B01275D16A,"This is a scary movie. The Mexican government, is regarded by a large part of it's citizens as ineffective at best, corrupt and criminal at worst. Not an entirely unjustified belief. Some government officials have been corrupted by the incredible money and armies amassed by the drug cartels. A movement known as ""Grup de Autodefensa"" (I think that's how it's spelled) takes over large swaths of Mexico, in self-defense against the cartels.

The film attempts to draw a parallel with the militia movements operating in border areas of Arizona, but those movements, more akin to survivalist groups, have the poorer argument. These are people literally defending their homes and families, many of the Autodefensa are children, some as young as 13. The self-proclaimed ""Arizona Recon"" expresses sympathy for the Autodefensa, see themselves as their moral equivalent. But the dangers faced are not even close.  It's not a movie for the faint of heart, the violence is graphic with no holds barred.

If it was a choice between the lives of my family and crossing a line on a map, I'd be jumping the border too.

7343379,4,B01275D16A,"Humanity has always been on a quest for power. Its difficult to argue with the fact that most wars were essentially caused by our animalistic desire to lead, to reign over others. That feeling of superiority and control  be it over dozens or thousands or millions  drives us to rob and pillage and slaughter. And no matter how idealistic their cause, leaders tend to become corrupt, overwhelmed and aroused by their own authority  the line between right and wrong, between philanthropy and self-interest, becomes increasingly blurry.

Matthew Heinemans edge-of-your seat documentary portrays the trajectory of such doomed idealism, through the prism of a Mexican cartels comparatively short lifespan. From the very first shot until the last unforgettable frame, it holds our attention like a first-rate thriller (the directors intention), breathlessly taking us right into the midst of the action, making us participants, as opposed to mere passive observers. Cartel Land traces the rise and fall of a small empire, one of thousands, in a land riddled with warfare and unthinkable acts of violence  but its also a statement on our penchant for violence, a reflection on the state of current affairsand a humanity thats perhaps beyond exoneration.

The empire Heineman depicts began as the Autodefensas: a small-town citizen uprising in Michoacn, led by the charismatic Dr. Jose Mireles, also a physician, known as El Doctor. After his neighbors were beheaded by the Knights Templar cartel  and an innocent farmer family massacred by the same criminals (a heart-wrenching scene shows a family member describing the massacre in vivid detail), Dr. Mireles took matters in his own hands. He, along with fellow townsmen, identified the houses where the Templars lived and struck back (an edge-of-your-seat sequence follows them on their hunt, a prime example of the striking verisimilitude Heineman achieves in his documentary). They were met by corrupt government forces, who confiscated Autodefensas weapons  but the town rebelled and cornered the military, until their weapons were returned. Was it truly a victory? And was Mireles driven by a strong need for justice, or did he have a hero complex and merely craved recognition and servitude (after all, hes shown as unfaithful, with numerous mistresses, of whom his saddened wife is bitterly aware)?

The beauty of Heinemans documentary is that its never manipulative, and the emotions it evokes are always conflicting: small victories result in horrific consequences; in Cartel Land, one mans justice is another mans tragedy; the heroes become villains, but the preconception of right and wrong is questioned; a quest for peace gradually reveals itself as an exorcism of personal demons.

This latter observation may be applied to Cartel Lands other cartel leader, leathery-faced Tim Nailer Foley, a veteran living in Arizonas Altar Valley (known as Cocaine Alley), right on the Mexican border. Abused by his father, and consequently resorting to drug abuse, Tim managed to quit, but grew appalled by the number of illegals after the economy crisis, working under the table and not paying taxes. This led to Tim forming the Arizona Border Recon, a paramilitary group, whose tracking of illegal immigrants morphed into a quest to hunt down drug cartels. Similarly to the Autodefensas, Tim was labeled a vigilante by the media. His unclear intentions lead to questions of motivation  is Tim just projecting the anger of his abusive childhood, searching for recognition (when asked why he does it, he says, If not me, who else?)? His troops reasoning differs wildly too: one man spews out nonsensical rhetoric about needing a wall to separate two groups of people who will never get along.

The film switches between Foleys and Mireles stories: as Mireles troops became more violent, spinning out of his control and forming their own cartel, led by Papa Smurf (a frightening, insipid, chubby little man, lacking Mireles charisma but possessing an affinity for violence, who quickly lost the Autodefensas leadership to the Michoacn government, who, in turn, formed their own cartel, called the Rural Defense Force), Foleys band of troops observed the news, approving of the cartels without any real understanding of their logistics, and attempted their own vigilante justice. If the film does have a flaw, its that Tim Foleys story is under-developed, especially when compared to the City of God-like, deeply thorough portrait of the Autodefensas clan.

There are countless scenes of such power, theyll wedge themselves into viewers minds forever. A girl recounts how she witnessed her entire family massacred by the Templars; she was later thrown in the graves with their dismembered bodies, raped and left alive to live with it. This leads to the viscerally intense apprehension of her captors. Another scene shows the Mexican President, assuring the civilians a state of law will be enforced  a statement that rings even more absurd from the perspective of the Autodefensas, to whom law, by this point, is an abstract term. Heineman is wise and true to his cinematic ambitions when it comes to portraying violence: at one point, Dr. Jose tells Chago, a member of the Autodefensas, to kill a member of the Templars, and Heineman wisely doesnt show the consequences, letting the viewers imagination run wild.

Heinemans goal to make his documentary as cinematic as possible was a success: Cartel Land is jam-packed with tremendously affecting, tragically beautiful visuals, such as the milk-white vapor building around a man cooking meth in pitch-blackness; or the outline of a guard, holding his rifle against the tangerine sunset, the juxtaposition of violence and beauty never more apparent; or a shot of white balloons, soaring into the air, an image of freedom in a world that knows none.

Cartel Land was criticized by some for lacking scope and answers  but thats its point. There are no answers. Of all the competing drug lords and politicians, the reigning king in Cartel Land is chaos  and Heidelmans brutally efficient documentary, an early contender for the Academy Awards, simply shows us the atrocities that happen, how they came to be, and how nothing is being done about them, making us question our own humanities.",1453334400,5,6279,5.224652087475149

7343405,5,B01275D16A,"This film by Mathew Heineman starts out by showing how members of one of the Mexican drug cartels make cocaine. He then takes us on a tour of both sides of the border, starting with the vigilantes in Arizona who have set up their own border patrol and explores their motivations and fears.

We also travel to Mexico to see the work of the Autodefensas and how they started up to protect their communities with the help of the towns doctor. We are shown witnesses who can attest to the vile crimes of these evil men and the wanton murder and extortion that they carry out. The authorities are seen as complicit as is the President, police, army and navy.

The people seem to reject all except those who can actually help. However, we are taken on a complete journey and the final destination is truly harrowing. This has been shortlisted for Best Documentary at the 88th Academy Awards  even if it does not garner that particular plaudit it will still be seen as an important and very powerful piece of film making  this is a film more people should see.",1450656000,,1053,4.49738219895288

7343408,4,B01275D16A,"This documentary is about Mexico and cartels, but it is also about vigilantism in general. Is it OK to take the law into your own hands? Does this freedom corrupt? The documentary explores two (related) instances of vigilantism, and it does so in a critical, but nuanced way. It reflects upon the motives of the people involved, and their situation. This exploration is what really makes this documentary great. It throws some light on the situation in Mexico in a way that is both thrilling and heartbreaking - but by focusing on the acts of the vigilantes, the documentary becomes timeless.

The people behind this went to great lengths to get some really(!) impressive footage. How they convinced people involved to let them film all of this is beyond me.",1449878400,6,758,4.8307692307692305

7343429,4,B01275D16A,"I thought this was an interesting movie. As somebody with a lot of knowledge regarding the topic matter, but some 10 or so years removed, it was quite compelling to watch this movie, which is a more modern depiction of the border war that has been happening for the last 20+ years. The people change, but the conflict remains the same. The fact that it is a documentary rather than a commentary piece made it all the more interesting to me. I hope this movie helps to shed some light on what has been happening to both our Americans living on the border, and to the Mexican nationals who are also forced to deal and live with cartel drugs and violence.

A great success of this documentary in my opinion, outside of shedding light on this under reported topic, was to also show how Americans and Mexicans aren't all that different. At the end of the day, we are all humans with the same basic problems, and the movie definitely helps to humanize both to each other.",1448582400,11,965,4.451977401129944

How this kind of stuff doesn't make it past the Kardashians in our nation's media platforms is beyond me, but at least it's here on Amazon to view. These journalists could have been killed making this. Simply amazing! My only negative about the movie is that it seems to have an attitude of ""Welp, it's never going to change. Nothing we can do."" I disagree. I think there's a lot we can do about turning tyranny and poverty around. It starts with you filmmakers and journalists and your powerful images and editing tools.

More time was allotted to the autodefense group that eventually breaks with and/or betrays its founder, however the movie leaves you no clue as to why. Little time is spent with the US group, which may be a well meaning group putting forth a lot of effort with marginal results...its hard to discern.

Mercy and grace are infinite, but so is severity, and one just gets the feeling that the tipping point has been passed, and now it is just a matter of time. As for the users.....there is this sense that these drugs make them think they know things but just makes them extra selfish. Were I human, if I knew that my 'recreation' can cause so much suffering, I'd rather suffer my bit in this world, and maybe this little suffering is the key to its own undoing. If illegal drugs really had the answer to all these initiatory problems, then it would already have solved them, they may get you in the door, but it also kills the same sophisticated machinery that is needed to complete the journey, so you might as well not have known...better off being a pebble or a tree.",1445126400,,1345,4.449392712550607

Good, timely, and interesting subject matter. An experienced producer and director. Probably a decent budget too.

But in the end, it's an unsatisfying film. The main people of interest never seem to be fully fleshed out, no in-depth interviews are really done. Many things were happening during the filming period, yet many things that should have been in the film seem to have been left on the cutting room floor.

The greed, corruption and cost in human life are the constants in the story. It is griping, sharp, realistic and strong.

8725528,5,B01275D16A,Phenomenal documentary,1532649600,,22,10.5
8725529,5,B01275D16A,An illuminating documentary on the effects drug trafficking into the United States via Mexico has effected both sides of the border and how both Americans and Mexicans alike have taken the law into their own hands in an attempt to stop the widespread violence and corruption. The documentary features gritty and brave camera shots which put you up close to the day-to-day violence that has so many of the Mexican people fed up with government sponsored terror and grants some perspective as to why vigilante militia groups have begun springing up on the American side. Be mindful to not become cynical due to the ending which is a testament to the strength of financial influence and the neglect of morality that can appear once people are given positions of power.,1532131200,,765,4.892307692307693
8725530,5,B01275D16A,"A very well done documentary ending in the most realistic way possible, complete tragedy.  Heroes are left to fight and die on their own, betrayed by corruption, and abandoned while left to rot and die.  I am glad no one tried to butter things up and put on a ""Christian ending"" to it all.  Overall very informative and a great delve into human nature.",1531872000,,352,4.46875

8725532,4,B01275D16A,"good perspective of people and root issues concerning our southern border.. Mireles looks like a modern superhero in this movie, but anyone who knows recent history knows that seemingly any person who tries to stand up for justice in mexico ends up getting taken down.. the part of the show when the farm workers are all killed because the farm owner owed some protection money to the cartels was absolutely gut wrenching. the footage of them catching a couple of two that raped and killed some of them was incredible. crazier than any reality television show I have ever seen.. my heart goes out to the good families of mexico. they get paid $0.72 an hour at legit US manufacturing jobs (on their side of the border of course) or risk their lives crossing the border for $4 cash working illegally on construction or landscaping.",1529884800,,829,4.724137931034483
8725533,5,B01275D16A,"I feel for the poor people in the middle of this, caught between their government officials and the drug and trafficking cartels. It has to be frustrating and scary, trying to figure out who the good guys are.",1529884800,,209,4.526315789473684
8725534,1,B01275D16A,"Everyone in the movie complains that the government won't help them. Well, the government is the damn cause in the first place! Then the militias have a free-mason handbook right in plain view of the first meeting they show, early into the movie. More foolishness, these people on both sides are just witless dupes, killing each other off while their beloved government, the central banks, and the secret societies behind them rake in billions!

This was a propaganda piece that works well on the bleeding hearts of the left and the authoritarian mindset of the right, but anyone who actually understands how the world really works can see right through BS. (hint for the plebs: right vs left, state vs drug dealer, is an illusion. They are all part of the same demonic machine!)",1529798400,,779,4.813432835820896
