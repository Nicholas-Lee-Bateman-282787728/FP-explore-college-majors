1111151,4,6306004041,"This is a bundled set.  That means three DVDs have been placed in a bundle in their original packaging.  That means three boxes, not one box with multiple disks.  That also means you will net get any material on the disks that you wouldn't get separately.  There is a small pamphlet with some behind the scenes notes on the films.  The three DVD's are as follows:
From Dusk Till Dawn Collectors Edition (includes the full-length feature Full Tilt Boogie and plenty of other extras)
From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money (no extras)
From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter (1 deleted scene)
Each of the films follows a formula of combining outlaws and vampires.  The first has a violent team of brothers running for Mexico where they run into a nest of vampires.  The second has a team of bankrobbers becoming vampires as they try to rob a Mexican bank.  The final film is a prequel to the series and has outlaws and posse run into a nest of vampires.
A nice collection of three good movies.  But since this is a bundle you won't save any space by buying them this way (although you may save some money).",1080604800,20,1112,4.465346534653466

However after they decided to make this into a straight-to-video franchise, both Rodriguez and Tarentino should be ashamed. The second and third movies were absolutely terrible. I just hope that they will not make a fourth addition here, ever. People beware, don't waste time watching [movies] like the sequels.

1111155,5,6306004041,"Finally, it has arrived!  The Deluxe Speical Edition From Dusk Till Dawn Boxed Set is out to buy and at the price it's going for you'd be quite simply foolish to pass up such an opportunity to purchase it.  What do you get?  You get From Dusk Till Dawn DVD, which includes LOADS OF BONUS MATERIAL which I'll talk about in a second.  You get the two follow-ups to the original:  From Dusk Till Dawn 2:  Texas Blood Money starring one of our best actors, Robert Patrick and From Dusk Till Dawn 3: Hangman's Daughter.  The two follow-ups to the first From Dusk Till Dawn, while certainly not as good as the original are not total let downs either.  Texas Blood Money is jam-packed with explosive action and thrills and Hangman's Daughter is more of the same with hardly any interesting plotting but the action is very intense!  For most of you who will buy this Boxed Set, you may have only seen From Dusk Till Dawn.  Even if you have no interest in seeing the two sequels, the bonus material on the From Dusk Till Dawn DVD is quite frankly phenomenal and worth the price of the whole set alone.  This is proabably the best DVD for extras that you'll ever buy.  It has a feature length making of documentary called Full Tilt Boogie which follows the cast and crew around throughout the making of the whole production.  No UCLA course can ever cover the amount of helpful information on that!  Outtakes are interesting and the music videos are a welcome bonus.  I won't bother telling you about the tonnes of other stuff on the disc, just go and buy it now!!!  YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!",971654400,5,1579,4.449477351916376
1111156,4,6306004041,"I was never into the vampire movie scene. In ""classic"" vampire movies, there is so much fore-shadowing leading up to vampire that the movie leaves the real world to go to the ""what if vampires were real?"" world. Call it the ""formula of all vampire movies"" Not so in FDTD. the first half of the movie is classic Tarantino. Two outlaws (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) on the run hijack a RV with father and two kids (one of them is Juliette Lewis) still on board. The outlaws force the family to take them cross the border to Mexico. After arriving at a bar somewhere in Mexico. The family is about to be released when vampires finally do show up and huge battle ensues. The turning point is a notoriously seductive dance seen by Salma Hayek. Cheech Mareniz has a bit part in this one.
The sequel, ""Texas Blood Money"", is pretty much hated by every person I've known, So I won't bore you with to many details. Suffice to say there are outlaws and vampires in a botched bank heist. FDTD2 has Robert Patrick as the ringleader, and Bo Hopkins as the Sheriff. I was let down that the ""formula"" was used in this one, it had potential. FDTD2 is the reason why this box set loses a star.
The third movie is actually a prequel, set in the Old West. ""The Hangman's Daughter"" returns to the original FDTD style of ""then all of a sudden, vampires!"". Esmarelda (Ara Celi, the hangman's daughter) elopes with outlaw Johnny Madrid, and the Hangman rounds up a posse to chase them down. Various other character's get entwined with each party, and they all end up at the FDTD saloon. I should note that one of the main characters, Ambrose Pierce, is a true author/poet that did disappear in Mexico in the 19th century. FDTD3 also stars Rebecca Gayheart, and has the original bartender from the first two flicks, Micheal Parks. FDTD3 would have a great stand alone western (Robert Rodriguez handy work is evident throughout) and is definitely worth seeing.
The special features have not been announced yet, but if they include deleted scenes from all three, and/or commentary, I will definitely replace my collection with this set. I was extremely disappointed with the fact that the first releases contained no special features. Now I have to find someone to trade with",967680000,10,2258,4.6475
1111157,4,6306004041,"this film was definitely better than other vampire movies that I've seen... not as good as the original...but we all knew it wouldnt be...but good.... It took a while for the vampires to show...just like in the  first...but it was all worth it....the film does get a bit cheesy towards  the end and it does end pretty abruptly, but overall, the film is good,  even though it could have been better. The film was shot for theatrical  release, but the made-for-video quality is evident. Rebecca Gayheart is a  beauty, but she doesnt act her best in this film...basically, the film is  good, low-quality, but still interesting....if u loved the original but  hated the second, you'll like this....",948326400,2,694,4.880341880341881

7899672,4,6306004041,"I think From Dusk Till Dawn Trilogy is somewhat in its own genre. These movies are a mix of action/horror/comedy. I am going to review the box set in reverse order. Let's start with the prequel, The Hangman's Daughter. Set 100 years before the original, this movie shows you the origins of the Mexican Cantina in the original film. In other words, the Hangman's Daughter is where the From Dusk Till Dawn saga really begins. It also tells the story of Ambros Bierce going to Mexico to aid Pancho Veila (spelling?) in his personal war. Eventually, Ambros just disappeared and to this day historians can't figure out what happened to him. Though the events of Ambros Bierce and Pancho Veila are based on a true story, this movie suggests that... well, you watch it and see for yourself. As for the film, it keeps the formula of the original in the sense that it starts out as a crime/action flick and later turns into a horror gore fest. You will also learn later on during the movie of who Santanico Pandimonium really is (she is from the first movie). Overall, The Hangman's Daughter starts off slow yet somewhat picks up. Fans of the original may or may not enjoy Hangman's Daughter. If you happen to be one of those who haven't seen the original, you could check this one out first though I thought it was a bit mediocre compared to the other two films.
Now for the second From Dusk Till Dawn prequel (yes, I said prequel). Texas Blood Money is often rated the weak one of the series and though I can see why, I think those ratings pretty much stem from people seeing this one after watching the original. Having been titled From Dusk Till Dawn 2 (as Hangman's Daughter was From Dusk Till Dawn 3) many expected Texas Blood Money to be a follow up to the original From Dusk Till Dawn. I must inform you people that Texas Blood Money is suppose to take place after Hangman's Daughter and before From Dusk Till Dawn. If you happend to watch these two movies in the order they came out, you would notice that some of the characters in Mexican Cantina who were killed in the first movie are alive and well in this one. Also, one of the police officers has a report on the Gecko Brothers from the first movie on their whereabouts in Texas. Now since the Gecko Brothers ended up in Mexico in the original movie, that would have to make this movie a prequel, wouldn't it?  Now I will admit, Texas Blood Money is a bit campier than the other films and the formula of the movie does not consist of there being a battle in the Mexican Cantina during the second half of the movie unlike Hangman's Daughter and From Dusk Till Dawn though make no mistake, there is a battle. In fact, only one of the characters from this movie goes into the Mexican Cantina but it is a brief scene. Again, I understand why a number of you didn't care for Texas Blood Money though remember, it wasn't intended to be a sequel. While it is not the original, it is overall entertaining just like Hangman's daughter and in my opinion it has more humor than the other From Dusk Till Dawn films.
Now for the original, the best in the series, and one of the more unique movies period... From Dusk Till Dawn! If you haven't seen this, or if you have but haven't seen the others, you must admit that this is probably Geoge Clooney's best performance. I have seen some good movies with Clooney in them but he tops it off in this one. One thing I can say about From Dusk Till Dawn is that it has a great supporting cast. Robert Rodriguez & Quentin Tarantino both produced this movie though Robert directed it. Quentin has more of a role in this movie than he does any other flick he's appeared in though I must tell you his character isn't really likable. Anyway, if you happen to have never seen this than you will be a bit taken by surprise when viewing it. I know I was. I won't spoil the plot though I will say what starts out as a crime/action flick turns into a horrific battle for survival. The ending though not happy is not predictable and won't ruin the movie in any way. Come to think of it, From Dusk Till Dawn is not really predicatable which is part of what makes it good.
Now for the DVD's: The Hangman's Daughter only has one deleted scene for a feature and it isn't that good. Texas Blood Money doesn't have any features though the DVD has nice picture and sound quality. As for From Dusk Till Dawn, its loaded with features as it should be. You get featurettes, outtakes, deleted scences, music videos, still galleries, trailers (though I really don't consider those features), and cast/crew biographies. Plus, you get an additional featurette called Full Tilt Boogie which is a 90 minute documentary on the From Dusk Till Dawn movie. Now this is a DVD! Oh, the DVD also has good picture and sound quality.
Well, there is my box set review. If you have seen the From Dusk Till Dawn Trilogy and don't care as much for the prequels, I understand. Though Robert Rodriguez didn't direct the prequels he co-produced them and he intened for them to be seen in the order of From Dusk Till Dawn 3,2,1. So you ask, why weren't the movies done in that order? Its because Robert did not officially do Hangman's Daughter or Texas Blood Money. If you haven't seen the From Dusk Till Dawn films or if you have but were iffy (is that a word?) about the prequels, watch the movies in the reverse order they came out (at least FDTD 1&2) and I think you will enjoy the series better.
I hope this review was helpful.",1122940800,11,5473,4.408102766798419
