8384469,2,B0002MHEP0,"This DVD gives credit to Alice Cooper, as a big fan of Alice, I bought it as soon as I seen it advertised. I haven't been this disappointed since I received socks for Christmas. Alice had a very small part in this DVD of short scary stories. Very disappointed. Some of the stories weren't too bad but buyer beware. If you do purchase don't buy it thinking it is about Alice Cooper.",1127952000,20,381,4.305555555555555
