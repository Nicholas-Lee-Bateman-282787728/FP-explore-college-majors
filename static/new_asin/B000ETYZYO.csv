8114441,3,B000ETYZYO,"If you know somewhat of  how to do Tai Chi, and a bit versed in the moves then this would be great.  If you have none of that then it is a bit hard to learn much because he goes through it fairly quickly.  As long as you are willing to play and rewind a lot it might work ok, but to be fair I think that to realistically learn this or anything like it, you are best off going to an actual class where a pro shows you hands on until you get it correct.  Then when done you could use this tape to fine tune your skills.",1376697600,,517,3.7155963302752295
8114442,5,B000ETYZYO,"My spouse and I have used this well-done video to learn Tai Chi.  We are both retired and it really helps keep us limber and balanced.
Highly recommended!",1209600000,7,154,4.5

This is about 57 min, you can see what it looks like at those places for previews.
He starts with Qi Gong warm up exercises that I've seen on my favorite Qi Qong DVD ""Discovering Chi"" & also Dr. Yang Jwing Ming's ""Eight Simple Qigong Exercises For Health - The 8 Pieces of Brocade."" He only does a few of them of those DVDs, but he speaks at a clipped pace & does them quick which is good for those who get bored easily. His execution of the exercises though seems a bit sloppy which worried me. This portion including a min intro of the workout is 19 min including using a few acupressure moves as well. There is some neck & head tapping, thymus thumping, teeth clicking, tongue rolling, face massage, abdominal massage, joint shaking, leg swinging for lymph, arm swinging for the heart, ""the elephant raises his trunk"" for the pituitary, etc.
Next is him demonstrating the Tai Chi w/two women, one who is 92. He does it 1x with all of them facing the camera & then again with him along with his back to the camera. There is no instruction for this part for 8 min.
From my limited Tai Chi knowledge of only Short Yang style, I recognized some of the moves like single Whip, press & release, repulse monkey. The foot movements seem to be modified a little with extra step to normal stance or eliminated any kicks to make it easier w/less balance & leg strength needed.
He then uses the last 20 min to teach it each move slowly with all the arm movements, what not to do, etc. He doesn't put much emphasis on telling weight distribution like in a real class or in Terrance Dunn's. He also teaches the whole 4 min. routine with the breathing & instruction.
It ends with ""holding the big jug"" or ""micro cosmic orbit"" is a simple standing with visualization of energy traveling up the spine, over the head, and down the front of the body w/deep breathing.
Mark Johnson has great knowledge & gives great information but tells you quick with good, relaxed speaking like to a friend, not a monotone lecture.
When doing the Qi Gong part, even though he sails through it at a quick rate, I felt more relaxed & calm after. Also since I already had a year of Tai Chi classes in short yang, I did following along in the portion with him & 2 women was nice.

If you order it from here, make sure you email the sellers first to make sure you have the right VHS w/Mark.",1184976000,13,2468,4.3652173913043475
