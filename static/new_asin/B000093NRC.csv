I thought there would be some good info on playing base ball.

The ""interviews"" were poor with Pete Rose talking over over the

interviewer most of the time.",1368144000,2,209,4.447368421052632
7988835,4,B000093NRC,"A really good teaching video.  My son and I enjoyed it, and we both learned much from it. Pete covers some really important areas, it just needed to be just a litte more clear in a couple areas to rate a ""5"".
