8262118,2,B0016CIV6Q,Be careful. I thought I was ordering a movie of the same name starring Richard Greene and received this 1920s silent film instead. Probably worth checking out if you're curious to see what a charming screen presence Marion Davies was.,1523404800,,234,4.875

8262120,5,B0016CIV6Q,"A fun movie to learn about Robert Fulton and the steamboat!  We used it for science class, but time period history is brought to life with a full-size replica of the steamship and Robert Fulton's ingenuity and determination.  The supporting characters are a lively addition to the tale.",1477958400,,286,4.9375

8262122,4,B0016CIV6Q,"Interesting Hollywood film based on the stage play about artist/inventor Robert Fulton's (Richard Greene) arrival in New York and his problems getting his first steam powered paddle boat successfully built.  With the encouragement of tavern owner Patricia O'Day (Alice Faye) and the aid of friend Charles Browne (Fred MacMurray) he struggles to overcome money problems and attempts to stop his efforts by those that think it will cost them their jobs.  A entertaining film that allows Alice Faye to show her acting talents.  Her fans clamored for her music and they finally relented and added a song in the film so she could sing a little of it to appease her admirers. Nice flick, worth a watch.",1429747200,,696,4.931623931623932
8262123,5,B0016CIV6Q,This DVD-R release from Grapevine is quite good.  It has very good video quality for a film of it's age.  It is a pleasure to see a good looking silent with its original titles.,1379980800,4,177,4.176470588235294
8262124,4,B0016CIV6Q,What a gem of a movie even though its in black and white. It has many great actors and good story line with real to life sabotage. It was great to see the invention of the steam boat. The acting was excellent.,1358899200,3,209,4.0
8262125,5,B0016CIV6Q,"IF YOU ARE A MARION DAVIES FAN, THIS IS A CUTE MOVIE. THE PREMISE IS A LITTLE FAR FETCHED BUT, WHO CARES, IT'S MARION AND SHE CAN DO NO WRONG.",1356739200,2,142,3.7666666666666666
8262126,3,B0016CIV6Q,"Twentieth Century Fox have hopped on the band wagon at last and are issuing their film library (gradually) on to no frills DVD-R's.  The downside is the prints are unrestored and therefore of variable quality but the upside is that you may be able to obtain prints of rare films of your particular favourite performer.

In this case, all Alice Faye fans will be pleased to be able to add to their library ""Little Old New York"".  This sumptuous production, directed by Faye's favourite director, Henry King, (""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" and ""In Old Chicago"") is a delightful comedy drama of the story of Robert Fulton who launched the first paddle steamer.  As a nostalgic piece of Americana, the film is very entertaining even if the facts are distorted. Faye plays feisty Irish barmaid, Pat O'Day, and she is as animated and amusing as she ever appeared.  This is a straight comedy performance and Faye dominates the film perfectly. She has two well cast leading men, rugged Fred MacMurray and gentlemanly Richard Greene, opposite her. She only sings a few bars too.

The print is good but the price is high given the DVD has no extras, not even a scene selection.",1356220800,17,1164,4.766169154228856
8262127,4,B0016CIV6Q,"I've had a bad taped - from - TV VHS copy of this film for years so, needless to say, I'm happy that Fox has finally released it on DVD. It's the bare -bones packaging that comes with this Cinema Archives series of releases from Fox but - hey, it's better than nothing! No chapter index, no glossy photos, no extras of any type. There was only really one problem - when I received the DVD, the box was packaged and sealed with the wrong DVD in it. It came from the manufacturer this way; it was not a mistake by Amazon. Amazon took it back without any problems and sent me a new one (thanks!).

This is basically a non - singing role for Alice Faye (one small song). I'm sure that the story line is a highly fabricated account of Robert Fulton's efforts to build his steam boat but it's Hollywood in the 1940s and the film is really more entertainment than history. Everyone one in it is very handsome / pretty. Alice is a real favorite of mine and I like her in just about any film she did. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that Fox will eventually release some of her films from the 1930s.

The quality of the DVD print is certainly better than my old homemade VHS tape (where one scene is so dark that I had no idea of what was going on in the film).",1356048000,9,1251,4.1440329218107
