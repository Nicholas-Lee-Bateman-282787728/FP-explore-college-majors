3962684,5,B002OOWKXA,"Adam-12 is one of a kind.  I have 6 seasons and have ordered the 7th.  I watch them over and over.  What great role models Malloy and Reed are.  The whole cast including Bill Boyett made a lot of people want to become police officers.  Jack Webb knew how to produce great television series with a great cast of regulars. I saw it when it  first aired in 1968 and have watched it ever since. Now it is on Antenna tv along with Dragnet.

Police work in the '70s was exciting and there was a lot to learn about obeying the laws of the land, but Officers Malloy and Reed were on the job as well as being the best of friends off duty.  Whatever happened to actors Martin Milner and Kent McCord today...they should be commended as the best pair of actors ever to portray two wonderful LAPD policemen Pete Malloy and Jim Reed!  Kudos to the late Jack Webb for creating and producing the best crime drama out on TV!",1334016000,12,801,5.291338582677166
3962687,5,B002OOWKXA,"even though i won't be getting this final season of adam-12 until april 10,2012,i still want to say how badly my family and i are waiting for it to arrive.  this show has got be the greatest cop show ever put on television.it is our #1 favorite cop show of all time.every season we buy we try to stretch  it out over acouple of months so we don't run out of episodes to soon.but it doesn't work out that way.we like adam-12 so much that we run out of episodes within a week's time.so in closing i and my family have to agree with one other fan of adam-12 go reed and malloy.

3962688,5,B002OOWKXA,"Probably the most entertaining series ever. Every episode is full of action and who knows what. Suicides, Snipers,Robbers you name it Malloy and Reed have dealt with it. They play those parts so well Kent McCord and Martin Milner you really believe they are cops and not actors. Lots of pretty boys play other cops and guest stars. This precent just happens to have handsome men on their force and behind every desk. Very rarely you see a fat or homely cop on Adam 12 but they do exist. Its nice too every now then they involve a police woman who at the time were awfully brave to become one in those times the series was produced. This show has inspired many boys and girls who watched the first time to actually enter the police academy when grown up. Just hearing the opening credits gets you all revved up for each episode. All good things come to and end as corny as it sounds. But we got seven great years with plenty of action and suspense to keep us tuning in every week and now with dvds we can watch it whenever we want uncut and perfect. Now thats life!",1330646400,12,1064,4.325

3962797,5,B002OOWKXA,"I wasn't even born when the show went on the air, and only watched it (despite being a huge fan of Jack Webb's work) a few years ago. I was initially dissappointed that it ended after 7 season when it was still going strong, but upon re-watching, you can see why they called it a day - McCord was getting very famous in his own right and Milner, having reached his mid-40s, was getting very stout and slowing down considerably. The quality of the episodes remained consistently high, but he action sequences became fewer and shorter as the season went, and much more focus was on other officers. While it was still a terrific show until the end, all the signs were in place that it was the beginning of the end, so they wisely went out on top.",1399939200,4,743,4.35251798561151

3962800,4,B002OOWKXA,"Los Angeles police Officer Pete Malloy(Marty Milner)and his faithful hotshot rookie partner, Los Angeles police Officer Jim Reed(Kent McCord) return in this 7th Season of this spin-off police drama that ran on NBC from 1968-75.

Based on real police events around the City of Los Angeles, this 1974-75 Season finds the patrolmen busting scam artists, training rookies, working narcotics, searching for missing persons, tracking a suicidal man, dealing with a citizen hell-bent on taking the law into his own hands and more.

Created by Jack Webb as a spinoff of NBC's hit police drama DRAGNET, this 1974-75 Season of ADAM-12 caps off a historic run for one of television's greatest pioneering police dramas, especially for the LAPD, especially since Malloy & Reed were LAPD's finest patrolmen just like gritty homicide detective Sgt. Joe Friday(Jack Webb)and his faithful partner, Det. Bill Gannon(Harry Morgan)were LAPD's finest investigators.

Additionally, it's so nice being able to watch these episodes of ADAM-12 complete & uncut without all those deleted scenes you get watching them in reruns on Cozi-TV, ME-TV, Antenna TV, and TV Land.

So now that this 1974-1975 Season of ADAM-12 is released, I can now add it to my DVD collection of DRAGNET, HUNTER, CHiPs, and of course to the rest of my season collection of ADAM-12 on top of that.

BTW, Warner Bros.is releasing CHiPs- Season 3 out on DVD on March 3, 2015.",1389657600,8,1421,5.107758620689655

While it was arguably a little idealistic, Jack Webb's insistence on authenticity rings true, even today. I own the entire series, because it inspired me to become a police officer in Los Angeles, where I have served for 43 years.

I would recommend this series to anyone who has ever thought of going 10-8.",1355875200,27,429,4.487179487179487
3962824,5,B002OOWKXA,My husband and I really enjoyed this series. It was a good wholesome show and it reminded of me of growing up as this was on when I was little. Hated to see it end.,1355097600,,164,3.7142857142857144
3962825,5,B002OOWKXA,Reed & Malloy first appeared on an episode og Dragnet. I loved this show then and acctually saw an episode being filmed durring a back lot tour of Universal Studios in 1969.,1354579200,,173,4.4375
3962826,5,B002OOWKXA,These DVDs brought back so many memories from when I was a kid. Loved the program then and still love it now! Can't wait to buy the other seasons! This 2 guys were the reason I chose law enforcement as a career! Thank you Martin Milner and Kent McCord!,1350864000,,252,4.163265306122449

3962838,5,B002OOWKXA,The best crime show ever from tv. Now have the complete series episodes. My favorite tv show and never missed an episode when it was on tv. The complete dvd series is worth getting.,1349395200,,181,4.352941176470588
3962839,5,B002OOWKXA,"I loved this DVD. It was well organized, the episodes were easy to access. I think this was the best season of all seven. The chemistry between Kent McCord and Martin Milner took front row seating and the stories had a more human tone. We got a glimpse into Reed's home life and Malloy's abilities as a commander. I wasn't really happy with the last three episodes as Malloy and Reed were seperated much of the time. I got the distinct impression the producers were trying to spin-off Kent McCord in an Adam-12 clone. But, all in all, very satisfied.",1346198400,3,550,4.51
3962840,5,B002OOWKXA,"I still need Seasons 3-6 and my set is complete! Reason I wanted to grab the final season of ""Adam-12"" as soon as I knew it was out before I got the others was because one of the episodes(""Alcohol"")was largely filmed in my hometown of Van Nuys, California(Martin Milner lived there for awhile too, especially during filming the show)and one of the chase scenes was filmed right in my neighborhood. In fact, the chase zooms by my house in the background and my dad(very)briefly appears while he's leaning against our car watching the filming. Alas, I couldn't go outside to watch the filming, but I did sneak glances out our front door. My dad got to meet Martin Milner during a break in shooting & my dad said he was a very pleasant man. I love ""Adam-12""! My husband and I are big fans:) Wish there could have been more seasons:(",1341360000,3,829,4.496688741721854
3962841,5,B002OOWKXA,"Adam-12 was one of the best police series ever, covering the day-to-day life of a Patrolman in early 1970's Los Angeles.  I especially enjoy Jack Webb's realism and attention to detail.  I'm glad Shout! Factory decided to finish putting out the series on DVD after Universal released only Season One.  I watched the show as a kid and in syndication, now I'm enjoying seeing the episodes again as they haven't been around in years.  Awesome!",1338508800,,440,4.826666666666667

3962843,1,B002OOWKXA,"Very disappontment.....Adam 12 is my favorite show.  From Season One to Five, it has closed caption or subtitle.....not six and seven. Shout Factory discontinued creating a closed caption/subtitle on Adam 12 Season six and seven.  Why stop in the middle of seasons???  I spoke the owner (his name is Greg) of Shout Factory and he doesn't care or worry about deaf or hard of hearing people. That is discriminating. Since they create from one to five, they should not stop in the middle of the seasons like six or seven. What happens if you lose your hearing? And you will need closed captiion or subtitle?  Please support deaf or hard of hearing people by calling Shout Factory to re-do on both six and seven.  Thank you.",1337731200,29,720,4.682539682539683
3962844,5,B002OOWKXA,"This has been a great series from end to end and I hated to see it over. It was also a good leap backward into time as well,since times have changed as have police procedures. Still,It was one series that tried to remain true to its premise and yet brought wonderful characters that could be loved and worried over like old friends, as it put people into those uniforms to remind us that it is always people on those front lines and that those entities in the police units are not either faceless,mindless or without feeling.",1337644800,,525,4.479166666666667
