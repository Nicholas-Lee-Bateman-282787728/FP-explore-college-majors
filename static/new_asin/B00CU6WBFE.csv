5741125,5,B00CU6WBFE,"Seen this anime a while back and the second season fell in love with the series. The series is fairly laid back with a lot of comedy, I enjoyed it greatly and I'm very excited to finally own the first season!! Its a great slice of life anime I'd recommend it to almost any anime fan even if the genre isn't normally what you'd watch because it may surprise you and will have you laughing. Hopefully the second season will be sold here soon!!",1375833600,2,441,4.261904761904762
5741126,5,B00CU6WBFE,"Although some of the previews and the opening theme make this show seem like it is just another fan service anime It actually has a lot more too it. The plot is not over baring so its still a fun and playful show to watch, but at the same time there is actually a bit of drama to the story so its not just mindless. It is also full of references to nerdy stuff like video games (specifically Monster hunter and MMORPGs), dating simulators, and mecha related stuff. I found it to be a cut above your usual slice of life or fan service show it had a bit of everything making the entire series worth its time.",1372982400,16,606,4.1440677966101696
5741127,5,B00CU6WBFE,"If you look at my review history, you can actually see my progress on this series. I reviewed the first volume of the manga shortly after its release and gave it a positive review, noting that I had not yet seen the anime. Well, I watched it on Hulu now, and I can now declare that I am a huge fan of this series, both anime and manga. It's actually managed to make it on my top 5 comedy list.

The plot follows a group of students who, ""don't have many friends"" (that's the basic translation of the title). It's rather an inaccurate statement as they don't seem to have ANY friends whatsoever. One of them gets the idea to start a new club, ""The Neighbor's Club,"" to find people who are as desperate for friends as they are.

The anime perfectly catches the comedy of this situation. It should be noted that someone going into this series looking for a lighthearted anime with cute characters making friends will probably be disappointed. Some of the characters are rather unpleasant. I do not say this to insult the series, in fact I applaud it for this choice, these are rather damaged people looking for friends, but lack the social skills to keep one. The cast of characters include Kodaka a scary looking guy (who's probably the nicest of the lot), Yozora a manipulative girl with an imaginary friend, Sena a rich and pretty girl whose status (and her constantly reminding everyone of it) creates tension when she tries to make friends, Yukimura a guy(?) who is trying to be more manly and Rika, brilliant scientist and constant source of intentional innuendo. There are others, but these are the chief members of the club.

Throughout the series, these people constantly torment each other, bicker, argue and occasionally try to imitate actions they see other students do around their friends. This last leads to many moments of utter comedy gold including (my favorite) an episode where the girls play a dating sim game in order to developed social skills. The choices they make in game were utterly hilarious, and I refuse to spoil it here.

I should probably warn potential viewers that when I said these characters torment each other, I was serious. Several moments between Yozora and other characters can potentially make viewers uncomfortable as one of her greatest joys is tormenting the others until they cry. While this is played mostly for laughs, there are one or two moments where even the other characters seem to be getting uncomfortable at how far she goes.

In closing: I love this series. It's one of the funniest anime series to come out in years. I applaud Funimation for releasing in on DVD/Blu and will be getting this day one. I give both the anime and the manga my highest recommendation.

Note: There is a second season and Funimation has licensed the anime for the US so hopefully we'll see a release of that one too.",1371081600,28,2849,4.665338645418327
5741128,5,B00CU6WBFE,"I have not watched the dubbed version but the subbed one has become 1 of my favorite animes. Yozora is the stand out character in a strong cast of characters. Again I am not sure about the english spoken version but if the cast is as strong as the Japanese version then I cannot recommend this anime enough.
Edit: I have since watched the english dub which was also good but the japanese voice cast is so strong that I would recommend the subbed. Unless of course that just isn't your cup of tea. Also while watching the english dub I got a little surprise that I did not notice before. The cast from Oreimo shows up for a real quick cameo while they are showing some scenes talking about comiket. Which if you like this series you will most likely like Oreimo as well.",1370908800,2,769,4.310344827586207
5741129,5,B00CU6WBFE,I love this anime. It made me laugh so hard. I usually get bored with this type of anime but this on is much better. I just hope they gave them good voices that suit them.,1369699200,14,171,3.7777777777777777
5741130,5,B00CU6WBFE,"Hasegawa Kodaka,a recent transfer student,inherited naturally blonde hair from his long-dead British mother. That,along with fierce-looking eyes,he is presumed to be a ""yankii"",Japanese for,""bad one"",what we call a juvenile delinquent. As such,he has no friends.
Yozora Mikazuki,an attractive girl in his class,is caustic,abrasive and solitude. She also has no friends.
One day,Kodaka returning to retrieve left-behind gym clothes,hears a conversation behind a closed door. Opening it slowly,he finds Yozora having a lively conversation with someone Kodaka cannot see. Interest piqued,he asks Yozora with whom she is talking to. Her attempt to claim it is her ""air friend,Tomo"" is brief and futile. She does express a clue to a surprise near the end by stating her ""air friend"" will never betray her.
Their conversation continues to develop until she has an idea that will help them become accepted and popular; the idea for the Neighbor's Club is formed.
Yozora commandeers a room for the club by bullying a 10-year-old nun out of her nap room. One of the delights of this series is watching Yozora in action. She is intelligent,quick-witted,caustic and pushy,not to mention vey attractive. She also demands and gets the little nun,Sister Maria,as club sponser.
The first new wanta'be member is Sina,who is hated with a passion by Yozora;she doesn't know her personally but as Sina is the daughter of the academy head master and has big boobs and has boys hanging all over her but she has no real friend. You can see why Yozora wouldn't like her,I guess.
Eventually,Yozora renames her ""Meat"".
Rika is so smart she has a special lab established for her private use,she attends no classes,she has no friends and is so nasty-minded she can read a normal manga as sexual erotica.
Yukimura stalks Kodaka and is caught. ""He""(maybe) explains that his parents gave him the name of a famous samurai in hopes of him becoming a strong man. He isn't and he is the target of constant bullying and has no friends. He sees Kadaka as his master. This proves to be a point of seriuos comedy as the series develops. But first,he encounters Yozora who convinces him that his masculinity will become stronger if he wears a maid outfit and serve the rest of the club as a maid. Not only does he do so he seems delighted to do it.
Kodaka has a 14-year-old sister in his care that sees herself as the ruler of some space empire and dresses as such. She has no friends either.
This series,long awaited to be released in the US, is fast paced,exceptionaly well-colored,drawn,acted and directed and is one of only a handful of exceptional releases this season. Most highly recommended for the intelligent.",1369526400,37,2680,4.971046770601336

5741145,5,B00CU6WBFE,"Haganai: I Don't Have Many Friends, is one of the first romance comedies I have really liked. The art and audio a done very good. The story revolves around a group of social misfits that want to learn how to makes friends and the bound the build along the way. Some of what surprises me was in a short series there is a lot more character development then you see in many longer series. At its core this series is a comedy, but it has romance, some light light drama, and other things. This series sets the bar for the romance / comedy genre as one of the best. Granted I would warn any viewers new to anime there is some passive content not appropriate for children.",1454112000,3,667,4.25984251968504
5741146,5,B00CU6WBFE,"Great English dub, good Blu-Ray package.  Price is a bit iffy.

The rating is for the English adaptation for the anime.  I have a few criticisms of the anime itself, mostly regarding the near-constant fanservice, which is totally extraneous.  I do like that there are a lot of little details in the anime that first-time viewers don't necessarily notice, such as all of the main characters appearing in the beginning of the first episode, mostly as background characters.",1448409600,,471,5.0

5741148,4,B00CU6WBFE,"This series reminds me rather strongly of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. We have a strong-willed heroine who coerces a biddable young man into forming a new after-school club. Things diverge from that point, but there are other similarities. In the second series (Haganai Next) they even make a movie. However there are no time travellers, espers or aliens in this series.

I like the characters in this series, including the stroppy big-busted rich girl, the mad scientist, the transvestite, and the 10-year-old nun. The younger sister who cos-plays as a vampire is fun.

I enjoyed watching this show enough to buy the sequel. I recommend it.",1446595200,,647,5.037383177570093

5741159,1,B00CU6WBFE,"You are no doubt reading to find out about whether or not Haganai is worth pursuing as an anime. The answer is a rather astounding no, I am ashamed to say. At first, the premise of a bunch of outcasts forming a club to make friends sounds great. But the problem is that, within the exception of the male protagonist, the rest of the cast is worth squat. There is barely any character developement and this anime seems to be far too affixed on the TnA standards in today's anime. There is also too much mental rubbish going on, with the cast telling themselves that they can't make friends. When it sounds as though they aren't willing to try in the first place. If you want to watch something entertaining, watch something such as Ranma 1/2.",1431561600,,741,4.455882352941177

5741189,3,B00CU6WBFE,"I wasn't entirely sure what I expected going into this but, I can say for sure, that I didn't get it. Haganai looks like a Slice-of-life, ecchi, romantic high school comedy with a little bit of Harem elements to it. What you instead get is a Slice-of-life high school tale with elements of comedy and a little bit of nudity kinda thrown in there for good measure, along with about as many stereotypical anime girl tropes you can possibly squeeze into a 13 episode series. I could definitely feel my interest in the show waning as it went on. The show peaks around episode 5 as the comedy elements really take off. However, nothing really interesting happens after that and, by episode 8, you've already hit the wall. The show kinda takes a serious element around that point and, while it tries to get back to the comedy, nothing else really works after that. Special mention to the English Dub here for being about as boring as possible. The guy playing the leading male couldn't be anymore uninteresting. Sena is really the star of the show here as they obviously used her as the fan-service main course for the entire thing with skimpy outfits and constant references to her boobs. In the end, I know I won't be purchasing the next season of this. The show just doesn't have enough going on in it for me to enjoy.

I digress the show is about attractive social outcasts making friends, kinda. There's a fair amount of fanservice which is too be expected from a harem romcom. There tend to be lots of references to video games and anime that may go over a viewers head if they aren't immersed into the anime and japanese gaming culture. The characters can be both great and terrible at the same time depending on who the episode wants to place in a good light. I think the show is alright, but it's nothing that will really stand out.

interactions between these Loser's Club (oops, Neighbor's Club) members is what drives the show, and
are what make it so watchable.

Be warned, however: there is something in this series to offend just about anyone. But for the not-easily
offended viewer, Haganai is as funny as anything ever produced.

The way it turns anime stereotypes around is wonderful. Instead of a Big Brother with a sister complex,
there's a little sister who's sexually jealous of him. The introverted porn addict is a girl, and the big-chested
blonde turns out to be a lesbian pedophile. Etc.

I was disappointed in the fact that the characters were not allowed to learn and grow from their caustic
interactions, but I hear that there is a second season, so am holding out hope for a satisfactory conclusion.",1411430400,,899,4.824675324675325

I also loved Maria's sister Sister Kate and I wish she could have had a bigger role in the show. As a warning this show does occasionally show nudity including but not limited to girls as young as 10.

5741235,3,B00CU6WBFE,"The characters are unique and well written.  The plot line concerns a bunch of ""lovable loosers"" who come together to form a club to help them find friends.  Each character is socially inept in a different way and their interactions are amusing.  The story line jumps through a few genres and different animation styles as the group does plays video games or reads their manga.  The constant ""bickering"" is light hearted and silly.  If this was the end of my review, this would be 5 stars.

This is the uncensored version and contains brief nudity in a few episodes.  While I normally don't care if a little fan service is mixed, and I many cases it adds comedic value, I didn't appreciate a few scenes.  A character who is identified as a ""middle school"" girl and looks 13, runs across the screen naked.  We're told the girl, who dresses like/is? a nun is only 10.  She always runs across the screen naked.  While both scenes aren't risqu they also didn't need to be in the anime... unless it's for creepy old Japanese men?  Minus 1.5 stars.

Another character is a feminine boy.  He is ""convinced"" that in order to prove his masculinity he should dress like a girl.  I suppose their some amusement in this concept... however in the last episode the group gets together to write a ""round robin"" story.  One of the stories has the two male lead, the guise of super robots, having sex.  There is nothing explicit in the animation, but it you're a straight and male it leaves you cringing.  Minus .5 stars.

Good story line, great character potential, just the above problems that drop this from 5 to 3 stars.",1401062400,3,1607,4.555944055944056

""Harem"" Meaned All Heroines , even all femail Characters which show in this anime all fall in love with the Male Leading Character.

Inflat the story is pretty funny. But really not flesh. Too many same kind of cambus love anime release before. You can't find any new element in it. The story is about a young man which don't have any friend. Suddenly he transfered to a new high school, he met his old female friend (but he can't recognized her). Then organized a club to recruit more friend.

The Male leading Character is too weak. It can't convince the audience why all Cute and Beautiful girls are loving him. Moreover, if so many girls loving him, why he refuse? Seemed so unreasonable. But if you are just looking for funny, It is good enough.

If you ask me why I bought this Anime Limited Box? Because it is cheap !  You should thank Amazon, they let it 50% off. Otherwise, I will not buy it.",1396224000,,973,4.41340782122905

5741245,5,B00CU6WBFE,"Haganai is by far one of my favorite animes/shows ever!  All of the characters in this show have great personalities and produce great jokes.  There are so many adorable girls in the series.  This makes it is really hard to choose which one will be your favorite. Here is why I like it so much, the animation is great, the characters are very diverse, the story is good, the jokes are laugh out loud funny and each episode has replay value.

As far as the story, it is about a bunch of socially awkward students that develop a club for people who don't have any friends.  The club will help them find out how to make friends by doing various activities like gaming and karaoke.  There are many game and anime related jokes within each episode.  As a person who plays video games a lot and a major fan of anime, the jokes make me laugh and I can appreciate the references that were put into this anime.

In case you were wondering this show is not child friendly.  There's nudity, sexual jokes, and adult language.  Thus the TV-MA rating.

The quality of the bluray is incredible.  Even if you have a giant television the picture comes out really clear.
I originally saw this series in the Japanese language and that had really great voice acting.  This bluray has English dubbing as well and it is not really that bad.  It stays true to the Japanese script and some of the voices chosen for the characters were well represented.

I don't have many negative things to say about this series or disc set in general.  I've seen many animes in past and started to give up on the new stuff until this show showed up.  If you like geeky jokes and cute girls you should really try this one out.",1393459200,,1686,4.387096774193548

I won't say this is the best anime I have ever seen, but I really love the characters and light story it has. It's just kids learning to make friends and learning about each other.

Be warned that the series is not suitable for children due to all the fan service and if you're unfamiliar with the term then let me explain.

The characters are funny and endearing with rivalries between Kobato vs. Maria and Sena vs. Yozora not really fights but lonely individuals masking their sensitivity by striking out at the very individuals who stand to be their closest friend.

Then there is Kodaka the misunderstood outcast because of his hair who strikes fear into all the student body but is actually the most stable, kindhearted, and binding force to the Neighbor's club.

5741292,4,B00CU6WBFE,"My teenage son LOVES this story and can't wait for Season II to come out. I liked it - great crisp artwork, good storyline, great music, funny yet moving in the right places... but.

The review covers both parts 1 and 2 of Season I.

I've listed most of the the pros above. It is also watchable as a standalone season. 'Haganai' has a second season already, in which the relationships formed in the 'Make Friends Club' deepen, but you don't need it to get the basic bitter-sweetness of the story. I also appreciated how the male lead, Kodaka, is written as a counter-harem character. Although surrounded by all the normal anime harem elements he has no bleeding nose, no crush, no kinky urges about the 10-year olds or the cross-dresser, few illusions about the women, and acts the gentleman. There's also no breaking the 4th wall which is almost refreshing for this genre.

The cons are worth knowing however:
1. The fanservice is quite cynical. This is not just a cheeky micro-second scene-cut, discreetly 'steamed' image or final ""cheesecake"" pose in a different art-style. We're talking slow pans of a girl's rear view as she bends over in tight pants. Don't be in the same room as your grandparents/parents/children while watching.
2. The lead female, Yozora, is written with a really nasty streak, truly sadistic. It may make her more 'human' but would you want to be in the same room as her, repeatedly? Kodaka's quiet toleration of her grates after a while.
3. It's a rehash or alternative take on another by the same studio, short title Oreimo, long title roughly 'my little sister can't be this cute.'
4. Kodaka has returned to his boyhood home. He used to have a best friend. What happened to the friend? This plot mystery element is telegraphed and obvious to everyone except Kodaka.",1382313600,2,1795,4.746794871794871

5741294,2,B00CU6WBFE,"I so wanted to like this series.  I love slice of life comedy anime.  I love several of the Japanese voice actresses.  I think Jerry Jewel, who does the male leads voice in the English audio, is really underappreciated.  The art and animation I saw in previews was great.  I happily bought this and was really excited to get it.

Then I started watching.  The jokes where falling flat, flatter, flattest.  The story just lay there and barely moved.  The big surprise ending was obvious fairly early on.  From a technical standpoint everything was great, it looked good, it sounded good, and yet the story just failed.

And it is too bad too because every so often, it did have me doubled up laughing.  Inside jokes referring to a couple of the voice actresses previous works I really enjoyed.  The concept of fighting mecha as extreme hardcore gay male porn was pure brilliance.  4 or 5 times this show had me giggling to the point I had to pause the show so I did not miss anything while I laughed.

They have to start as strangers again and try to become friends again, when the watcher want them to be boyfriend/girlfriend.

5741305,4,B00CU6WBFE,"Simple and quick is that this is a good show however after knowing and watching the second season, seeing only the first half leaves a lot more to be desired.

I'm not really going to talk about the packaging although I will say that this version is the smaller of the two versions (Special Edition and Regular) that difference is the only difference, you will still get all the CDs its just in this one all the dvd's and blurays come in one case as opposed to a cardboard sleeve that houses two. That aside the reason I gave it four stars as opposed to five is one that involves the plot, actually I was teetering between 3 and 4 but I decided to round up anyway, I watched this show during its first run on tv in japan, I thought it was extremely funny and entertaining... at the time. Fast forward to 2013 and the second season came out; I was elated however something just didn't seem to be as light-hearted, the story took a very serious turn that left me wanting so much more. After finishing the second season I returned to this blu ray and found all those subtle hints and things and inadvertently that had changed my perspective of the entire show.

In short, my second viewing of the first season wasn't the same

What its really missing my opinion is the second and (please make this soon) third season.

Please don't mistake me, the show is wonderful and the fact that I bothered going back, buying it for my personal collection, and writing in such a depth about the show is proof that I really love the show which is great however, now that I have seen the actual plot through season 2 watching the first season leaves a lot to be desired... in a good way.",1376784000,,1670,4.342948717948718

Being a walking doormat and resident ""No actual plot relevance"" the show tags us with a generic protagonist by the name of ""Who gives a crap, cuz we don't""  The show goes out of it's way multiple times to emphasise this fact. Playing a Fantasy game? Girls get actual characters, he's stuck as a NPC looking nobody, OR an Otaku, OR a school girl uniform...and not in the kinky or hilarious way.  His character is a rather decentish archetype, going for the ""Scary looking nice guy"" route, but it's been done better.  If you want a show that ACTUALLY FOCUSES ON HIS CHARACTER, go look at ""Toradora""  Same protagonist, only the show cares enough to develop him.

Next you have the Female Lead-duo.  Blondy and Black-Hair. Their personalities are rather weak early on, and rather than develop them the show tended to have them argue with each other. Without reason or warning, these two fight like dog's over nothing right from the start. Despite bandaid attempts to glue in some context, it comes off too little too late for me. The characters themselves do grow on you, so they fixed those problems, but you're going need to invest to get there.  The show's dual-female approach is really unique and I liked it a lot, but don't have another suggestion on where to find it, if you're going to watch it's probably because you want to see how they work.

Side characters include an underused Trap(Girlish boy) character, who was barely more noticeable than the background. Two little kid's, one a religious sister and the other biological, they're neat enough. And a crazy mad scientist girl, she was great. If you want more crazy scientists pick up ""Steins;Gate"" as THAT'S a well done series with a far stronger cast of scientists.

Side Note, episode 4, Mad Scientist describes a fan-fic fight scene between Unit 02(Neon Genesis Evangelion's Red Robot, Asuka's robot to be exact) and ZZ (IT'S THE DOUBLE ZETA GUNDAM, COMPLETE WITH DUAL BARREL LAZER CANNON ON THE RIGHT ARM!) in an extremely perverted and hillarious scene. Favorite in the series because dude, Gundam AND Neon Genesis reference....and sex references, lots of that...

With generic ""childhood friends"" relationships and ""You saved me therefore you love me"" kind of things, this series tries to not be a ecchi harem series, yet uses it's cliches. A huge problem with the whole series is the lack of world building. It's setting barely exists! You have a club room in a church, a school room....and his house.  A vast majority of shows win at setting, as it's damn important.  Take ""The world god only knows"" as an example of this. The show flaunts it's world to us, while introducing it's throw-away love interests and their locations throughout the show. From the Schools rooftop benches, or the past characters showing up in the background of the classroom, even throwing in their own lines and jokes because HEY, THEY EXIST IN THIS WORLD. It's a consistent and vibrant place. The world of Haganai doesn't give you that! That's a serious flaw to me! A vast many shows succeed at this, so why does Haganai fail here? You're showing the characters just fine, but not how they fit into the world! Haruhi Suzumiya is a great example of world building success, same goes for GTO's Holy Cross Academy! This show failed to build a world to get invested in!

However, it's not the worst show you could do, in fact if you like Harem-ish shows and want something not harem, yet similar, this is your best bet!  The show works in a humor and character level half the time, and is good for a decent watch later on...but you'll have to stick through the early episodes. And as they say, the first impression is VERY IMPORTANT! This one didn't deliver.",1376784000,4,3920,4.761061946902655
5741307,2,B00CU6WBFE,"Haganai is the tale of your average boy, Kodaka, going to a new school and getting treated as a thug due to some serious misunderstandings who meets the lovely Sena and incredibly hateful Yozora by making a school club focused on making friends. Due to those misunderstandings mentioned earlier, Kodaka is always fighting against the ruthless comments and rumors beind made about him (i.e. ""I heard he tried to attack the teacher!"", when he actually just tripped) and it begins to wear on Kodaka as he begins his life at the academy, ash he jsut wants to make friends.

Sena shows a dislike of all things ""ordinary."" She is both attractive and academically successful, but her resulting arrogance leads her to be disliked by her female peers. Their admiration eludes her, much as she desires it; she treats her male classmates only as servants to be used, although many of them would like to be her boyfriend. Nonetheless, she holds Kodaka to a higher standard.
Sena is also a lonely nerd girl, through and through. She plays eroge, much like a certain other closet Otaku who makes an appearance in episode 12.

Yozora is a cruel and selfish girl who says she understands and respects bullying but resents being called a bully herself. Yozora's difficult personality drives away anyone who might wish to make friends with her before she meets Kodaka. She is physically abusive towards, and often argues with, Sena and manipulative towards the rest of the club. The show d plays with the dynamic between her and Sena, as more Kodaka often scolds Yozora for her awful treatment of Sena, despite her hatred of being called a bully. It has the potential to lead to some great character development for both Sena and Yozora.

Does that sound interesting and like it would make a good show? It does? Good. Now throw it all away and forget I ever mentioned it, just like the show itself does. This show loses all of its potential after around the 3rd episode. Instead of focusing on Sena, Yozora and Kodaka becoming friends and developing social skills, the show instead focuses on its outlandish cast of secondary characters that really serve the plot in no meaningful way. Rika is the pervy nerd, Maria is the resident loli who has an obsession with poop jokes, Kobato is Kodaka's sister and is just Kuroneko from Oreimo without any of the good qualities, and Yukimura is just there.

All of these characters had the chance to produce interesting stories but none of them did. Of particular disappointment is the show bringing up Kobato's loneliness due to Kodaka's club activities. She could have had some real development, but instead they just shoehorn her into the club and everything just falls flat because she fades into the backgroun to do nothing more than bicker with Maria. Even Yukimura's gender identity crisis, Rika's social ineptitude, and Maria's religious background all could have been explored. Instead, every episode plays out like this: Someone at the clubs makes a suggestion for their ""training"", they do the suggestion and something CUH-RAY-ZEE happens, Rika makes a dirty joke, Yukimura acts like Kodaka's slave, Maria and Kobato fight over Kodaka, Yozora makes Sena cry which makes Kodaka mad and everyone is best friends again the next day. It says a lot about how bad your show is when the OVA epsiode (included in this release as Ep 13) is better than the entirety of your first season.

Now, onto the problems with the dub script adaptation. I ALWAYS watch my dubs with subs on for at least one episode. If the subs and dub dialogue match up nearly perfectly, I'll turn them off. If they don't, I'll leave them on to see the difference in the script and the dub usually wins due to changing cultural joks and making sentences sound much better to native english speakers. Haganai was a unique case where almost all of the main dialogue was identical, but the ADR writers saw fit to change nearly every reference to otaku culture that wasn't explicitly shown.

Why? Anyone who is watching this show knows what those references are. The only references that were kept were the ones about the Shark game, the Monster Hunter game and the mecha love scenes. Everything was changed to be entirely different references or watered down to try to make the jokes more understandable to the likes of viewers that would watch the show on Toonami. What's even more baffling is that they DID NOT change Kobato's supremely annoying ""kukuku"" nonsense into just a normal laugh or small chuckle. It's just as annoying in English as it is in Japanese. It really hurt my enjoyment of a dub that was otherwise very good. Jad Saxton gives a great performance as Sena, Alexis Tipton is her usual bubbly and amusing self as Rika and Jerry Jewel's voice fit Kodaka wonderfully.

All in all, pass on this and get a better show. Like Oreimo or Baka & Test.",1376611200,8,4854,4.771428571428571
5741308,4,B00CU6WBFE,"Funimation did a solid release of the first season of Haganai here. There's a decent amount of DVD/Blu-ray extras, the video quality is great, and the packaging is nice, except the lack of any interesting sleeve content.

The dub is better than average, although it does not come close to topping the original Japanese cast - especially on the part of Rika Shiguma. I just don't feel the energy and excitement that I got from the original dub, and thus a lot of Rika's, shall we say, ""moments"" fall a little flat and aren't as funny.

Kodaka and her sister Kobato are great, in fact I think Kobato's voice actress does the best job. She does a great transition from Kobato's little sister moments to her vampire fangirl alter-ego, and the humor translates very well.

Sena and Yozora generate mixed feelings. Sometimes I like them, and other times they sound uninspired. I also don't think Yozora would be saying ""like"" all the time and words like ""totes"". But they are certainly not bad in their roles.

That leaves Yukimura and Maria. In both cases the actresses accurately mirrored their Japanese counterparts, which I think is a good thing. Yukimura is soft spoken and calm, and Maria is hyper and childishly bad-mouthed.

Also, Pegasus and Stella's brief time on-screen were good as well. Drunk Pegasus is always a treat.

Overall, I hope Funimation does the 2nd season, and I recommend that Haganai fans check it out. For the most part the dub is a pleasant surprise. There are improvements that could be made because of how high a bar the original cast set, but I don't think anything detrimental happened to the humor and enjoyement of the show.",1376611200,3,1653,4.7421602787456445
5741309,5,B00CU6WBFE,"I figured I'd write a little review of this Blu Ray DVD Combo that's available. I'm sure many people wrote their reviews based on the episodes they've seen online. I actually bought the product from Amazon, so here's a quick little review.

The anime itself is one of my favorites. It has a ton of comedy and an underlying story that may make your eyes a bit watery. The second season goes even further with a love triangle, but we'll have to wait for that. I should note that this set is completely uncensored like the Japanese version. That means fully exposed breasts! Just a warning.

The set contains two Blu Rays and two DVDs. The first disc contains episodes 1-9, and the second disc contains episodes 10-12 and the OVA. I'm really glad they bundled the OVA with the other episodes. Many Animes make you pay for another disc with the OVAs. Well, I guess they're forcing you to pay for both the Blu Rays and DVDs these days on many TV Shows and movies.

The languages available are English and Japanese, but the Japanese voice acting is sooo much superior. The character Rika definitely steals the show with her voice actor. DVD audio is 5.1 Dolby Digital English and 2.0 Dolby Digital Japanese. Blu Ray Audio is 5.1 Dolby TrueHD English and 2.0 Dolby TrueHD Japanese. Why does the Japanese audio always get the shaft with the audio channels?!

Both the DVDs and Blu Rays have a 16:9 Aspect Ratio. The Blu Rays are native 1080p, and I'm guessing the DVDs are 480i like usual.

The extras aren't that extraordinary. There are no inserts other than a ""Fill me out. Win a weekly prize"" thing from Funimation. The extras on the disc include: Episode Commentaries, Blu-Ray & DVD Spots, Original Commercials, Promotional Videos, TV Spots, Textless Songs, and U.S. Trailers. Those extra features that are not commentaries only add up to 11 minutes. Total episode run time is 325 minutes.

Episode 01 - We Can't Make Any Friends
Episode 02 - There's No God in the Electric World (Commentary)
Episode 03 - There are No Flags At the Swimming Pool

Episode 06 - There Aren't Many Customers at the Karaoke Box

5741310,5,B00CU6WBFE,"I am so glad to have this anime set. I am also waiting for season 2.
It is very fun to watch and has some fun points in it.
This will make a fine addition to my anime collection.",1376352000,2,178,3.58974358974359
5741311,5,B00CU6WBFE,"The art box is very nice with lots of color and a whole group picture on the back side. Both cases for Blu-ray and DVD are nice with pictures of the characters both on the outside and inside. I also like how the art box has a glossy look and feels smooth but does not smudge or get fingerprints.

As for the series itself, it's a hilarious series. I haven't finished it yet but I really enjoy it and would definitely recommend it!

The only thing I was a little upset about was I pre-ordered this before it was even out. The box set itself was released on the sixth but because of shipping I didn't get it until the twelfth. Granted, I wasn't supposed to get the package until the sixteenth but I feel like if you pre-order a disc in advance we should all just get it when it comes out.

Other than that, it's all good!

Thanks again Funimation!",1376265600,4,845,4.197530864197531
