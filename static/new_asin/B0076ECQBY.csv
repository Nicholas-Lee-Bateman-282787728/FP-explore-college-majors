8510894,5,B0076ECQBY,"I liked this dvd so much that I made sure I had both part 1 & 2.  I can't wait for part 3 to come out.  These are very well done and are a ""breath of fresh air"" compared to all the politically correct evolution madness out there.",1428710400,2,229,3.75
8510895,5,B0076ECQBY,"I could blabber on and on about why I love this film, and why I think its a great piece, but I'm just going to try and keep it short, and make my points succinct and emphatic.

Intellectually the film does not disappoint, pragmatically laying out complex details & intricaces of the physics and chemistries of celestial objects not discussed or known by regular laymen. As other members have mentioned he also uses the words of secular sciences proponents to display the asinine perspective of them, and the injustice that they are taught as likely theory, and assumed as fact by the cultural zeitgeist. Unlike some other films, there is a lot of information contained here, and it would take an avid learner or astronomy major to learn it all. Lastly, the presentation of Spike's arguments is objective and professional, without eccentric ideas or petty retorts, and intelligently presented in a succinct and well paced manner.

The image of the film is beautiful. A very ambient film, without any sense of pretention or attitude. It has a beautifully artistic and minimalist image, with a very naturalistic & contemporary atmosphere. The graphics for the film impress the mammoth nature of space on the viewer, while also displaying the varying complexity and beauty of it. The score is also very abstract and naturalistic, creating an effective atmosphere while experiencing the intricacies and phenomena of space.

Some people may feel I praise the aesthetics of the film too strongly, but seeing how he handles all of the production alone (the biggest delay on their release), and is a Christian man not lost in the arts, its very impressive.
Rarely have I seen a Christian film presented so tastefully without being liberal, or so traditionally without being stuffy, boring or redundant. The film ends with a beautiful section on the glory of God and the nature of worship. Its a very down to earth movie despite the complexity of the subject, and the depth of how I praise it.

Five stars.",1415836800,,1996,4.913946587537092

8510897,5,B0076ECQBY,Makes a strong case for creationism. If you want to know the shortcomings of solar evolution this dvd will help.,1379548800,7,112,4.65
8510898,5,B0076ECQBY,"More questions are asked. As promised, some questions are addressed more fully while introducing others. again the NASA photos are breathtaking. More questions to be addressed in a promised Volume 3. I am in line to get that one",1374278400,7,228,4.871794871794871
8510899,1,B0076ECQBY,"The bible is not a science book and it is just utterly ridicoulous to take everything in the bible as literal.
When Genesis was written people knew almost nothing about our world.
This documentary is not based on any scientific facts at all.
It is a nice comedy, that`s true but please when you produce a comedy movie then sell it as such and do not list it under ""Astronomy"" on Amazon.",1372550400,6,386,4.375
8510900,5,B0076ECQBY,"Really enjoyed this video. I cannot speak highly enough. Production values are excellent. Spike Psarris paces the presentation well and is an engaging speaker. The space images in the video are awe-inspiring.

I showed this video to a group of high-school students who are somewhat jaded about videos like this, but they were drawn in so much that they made a second trip back to the church later on the same Sabbath because they did not want to wait a week in order to see the second half. I am now under orders from the same kids to buy Volume 1 so they can watch it too.

The science in this video is sound. The presenter includes many direct quotes from leading scientists in which the fundamental flaws of the Big Bang model are clearly admitted. These quotes come from leading scientific journals and respected publishing companies. The Big Bang model is condemned by the very words of those who purport to support it.

I've not only ordered Volume 1 for the kids, I've also ordered several extra copies of this video to give out as gifts to friends and neighbors. It is that good. Highly recommended!",1357430400,17,1107,4.6091370558375635
8510901,5,B0076ECQBY,"Loved this one and the first volume. This guy started his career as an atheist and evolutionist, then became a creationist after realizing how no other theory could explain the origin of the Universe other than an intelligent Designer (aka God).

One statement he makes says it all, when people reject the truth, they have to believe a lie. Wish more people were as opened-minded as he was when he started his career. It's hysterical reading these pathetic conclusions some scientists make because they can't possibly consider that God exists.",1338163200,13,543,5.033333333333333
8510902,1,B0076ECQBY,"""Did you know that according to the secular model, none of them should exist?""

Which model might that be?

Until recently, the Church has told us that the Earth was the center of the Universe, that the Heavens were perfectly aligned with the Earth.

Which got shot down by the 1st guy who studied Space with a homemade telescope.

So, again, what secular model are you talking about?",1335657600,11,384,4.602941176470588
