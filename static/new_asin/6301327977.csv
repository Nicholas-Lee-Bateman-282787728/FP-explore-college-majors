329545,5,6301327977,"Yeah, compared to the horror movies from the late 50's (Hammer Studio productions and Psycho) to today's in-your-face horror, these films are like strange dreams; but to daydreamers like me they are a wondrous haven from reality and reality-based TV/movies.  As long as a picture says a thousand words, and famous art is to be viewed and savored again and again, then that's where you'll find me on restless weekend nights with my provisions and my remote, steeped in the wistful tranquility these classics bring. I'm truly looking forward to these gems. I only hope Warner sticks to its release date.  Happy Halloween - 2005!",1119571200,28,626,4.9523809523809526
329546,4,6301327977,"This film is a simple dramatic story about medicine. It is a science that has to go beyond some rules to progress and improve man's lot. This is not easy to practIce because it attracts some criminal minds. It is not easy either because it goes along with a tremendous amount of doubt and self-denial. But it has to be done. When thE rules are too narrow, then crimes are unavoidable. For crimes to be avoided, the rules have to be adapted and curbed. Unluckily it is not easy to change rules about human life and human death. Does a doctor have the right to do what is forbidden to others ? Does a doctor have the right to decide on life and death ? Does society have the right to impose rules to science ? These questions have been in the air of our consciousness for centuries. And medical progress has always come from and through the breaking of a rule, of a law. It was once forbidden to dissect human beings. It was once forbidden to even speak of the inner functioning of the human body. Some had the courage to go against such rules and progress came. The film does not ask questions on modern times, on the very problems we are facing today like euthanasia or cloning. Yet the film is optimistic about medical progress and stands by the doctors who go beyond the rules.

329547,5,6301327977,"For those of you who love great horror films from the Golden Age of Hollywood, you must purchase a copy of producer Val Lewton's and director Robert Wise's eerie 1944 screen adaptation of the Robert Louis Stevenson classic, ""The Body Snatcher."" The ghoulish character of Cabman John Gray is perhaps the most unnerving, sinsister portrayal in Boris Karloff's long and great career. Loosely based on the real life story of grave robbers and murderers Burke and Hare who stole cadavers (and then produced even more corpses by murdering innocent men and women) for the esteemed mid-19th century Edinborough surgeon John Knox, this film is a tour-de-force of Lewton's legendary shadow and suggestion production techniques and Wise's deft directorial touch. But most of all it is Karloff at his menacing, spine-chilling best as the sinister John Gray who drives a horse and buggy cab by day but who, once the sun goes down, heads out into the foggy Scottish night in search of ""bodies"" with which to supply the surgeon Toddy McFarland.  Both men were old friends and colleagues of Knox many years earlier when they, along with the famous surgeon and his cadaver suppliers Burke and Hare, were put on trial for murder. But whereas Knox and McFarland escaped justice unscathed, Gray took the rap by protecting both Knox and Gray on the witness stand. Now Gray refuses to allow McFarland to forget the fact that his life and reputation were ruined by mob justice. McFarland is played flawlessly by the great yet underrated British actor Henry Daniell. Daniell is excellent in portraying the virtually unfeeling and amoral Doctor McFarland, whose approach to the advancement of medical science leaves much to be desired in human terms. Indeed, Daniel's understated characterization of the self-righteous Dr. McFarland is almost as chilling as Karloff's Cabman Gray. When McFarland learns that the ""redoubtable"" John Gray is no longer simply grave robbing but murdering to keep his business with McFarland alive, he tries to bribe Gray out of his life and out of the city of Edinborough. When the spiteful and vengeful Gray refuses to accept McFarland's bribes and threats, McFarland decides to ""rid myself of Gray once and for all."" I won't tell you the haunting final thirty minutes of this extraordinary horror classic. Let's just say its ending may be unrivaled in the history of the horror genre. No better use of nightmarish atmosphere was ever accomplished on film. Also on hand is the always wonderful Bela Lugosi, in more or less a cameo role, as the great actor was now in ill health. Yet even in a relatively minor role Bela lends additional ghoulishness to this already disturbing film. All of Lewton's films were genre classics that depended not on blood or gore, but rather on suspenseful and haunting atmospheres created through the use of shadowy photography, eerie lighting, and even eerier quietness at the tensest of moments. Purchase a copy of ""The Body Snatcher"" for Halloween. You'll remember Daniell's ""Toddy McFarland"" and Karloff's ""John Gray"" long after you've viewed the film. Happy Halloween.",1063843200,9,3109,5.072265625
329548,5,6301327977,"Karloff commands as the title role in this sinister look at medical schools in the 1800s. In case anyone doesn't know, this kind of thing (stealing bodies for dissection in schools) really did go on back then, which makes Karloff's character even creepier. In particular the scenes between Karloff's character Grey and the little girl are particularly haunting, as you see his ""tender"" side on the surface while at the same time knowing what lurks beneath. It's based on a Robert Louis Stevenson story. I believe this was the last movie pairing of Karloff and Bela Lugosi (I could be wrong). The sad thing is that Lugosi's career was already going down, and his role is minimal. This movie has one of the best endings of any horror movie I have ever seen.",1057104000,3,755,4.684210526315789
329549,4,6301327977,"Based on a story by Robert Louis Stevenson, this venerable classic barely qualifies as a horror film, but is excellent in all departments.  Surprisingly, it took a long time to be released and received mostly mediocre reviews when finally released!  However, it is probably the best film produced by Val Lewton, and Robert Wise proves he was already a fine director at almost the beginning of his career.  The atmosphere of early 19th century Edinburgh is fully convincing.  Boris Karloff is superb as Gray, cabman by day and body snatcher (occasionally corpse- maker) by night.  He rarely had a role better suited to him.  Watch for a young Robert Clarke as a medical student.",1005350400,5,677,4.894736842105263
329550,4,6301327977,"Another sterling effort from the Val Lewton unit, based on the short story by Robert Louis Stevenson which was inspired by the murderous Burke and Hare.  The studio (RKO) brought in big names Karloff and Lugosi to boost the box office of the series, but Henry Daniell has the leading role.  Karloff, not wasted for once, shows what he can do as a reptilian cab-driver in 1831 Edinburgh providing cadavers (some of his own manufacture) to the head of a prominent medical school...........The increased budget is apparent in the carefully evoked period sets and the moody low-key photography is excellent.  Daniell is good but it's Karloff who steals the show; he treats children and horses kindly while on the other hand, he also snatches girls off the dark city streets!  These villians, who are in cahoots, are, after all, providing an invaluable service to medical science - are they not?..........A quiet genre film that prefers to tell a strong dramatic story, THE BODY SNATCHER saves its big shock for the finale -  and it's a doozey!",1004486400,4,1039,4.880681818181818
329551,3,6301327977,"This, along with I Walked with a Zombie, is the best of the Lewton thrillers. A highly literate horror film it contains what is probably Karloff's finest performance. His performance is matched by that of Henry Daniell who plays a basically decent physician, tormented by Karloff's evil grave robber. Bela Lugosi has a minor supporting role as a none-too-bright would-be blackmailer who is ""disposed"" of by Karloff. This is a B horror film with grade A acting (by Karloff and Daniell), a grade A script and grade A attention to detail (set design, photography, etc.) Highly recommended. 3 1/2 stars.",1004054400,3,599,5.0

329629,4,6301327977,"(this review refers to the 2009 re-release version of this set)
The Val Lewton Collection features nine of Vals wonderful works for RKO pictures in the 40s. Generally speaking,Val was just a small cog in a very big wheel,but his influence and sophistication on celluloid continue to this day. I cannot say I am a Lewton aficionado in any way. What little I know is that he came from working with Selznick to RKO to helm their newly made ""horror""unit to compete with Universal. He was given the task of taking the most mundane and ridiculous script titles(the molehills),with the lowest budgets possible, and making something big out of them(the mountains)to produce some money making hits. RKO was not in good financial straits at this time(early 40s) due to Welles box office debacles of Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons.
That's the real extent of my knowledge. Now,after having watched all nine of the films(out of order),I can tell you Lewton was definitely someone with a totally different mindset for 1940s Hollywood. He didn't have a bunch of guys dressed up in monster suits running around terrorizing the towns folks. Instead each film became a set piece working on many levels,creating moods and through clever manipulation of sight and sound(or lack thereof),getting the audience to fill in the gaps with their own imaginations,much like the lost art form of the ""silent"" movies. He created some beautiful psychological melodramas whose influence can be seen in later films on the big and little screen. The Caine Mutiny owes a lot to the captain of Lewton's The Ghost Ship,and many of the later Twilight Zone eps were shot using the Lewton style,The Jungle with John Dehner being a prime example. Now let's look at the films themselves. For this occasion I will dispense with my usual rating of each one,but instead opt for an overall grade.
The first disc has Cat People and The Curse of the Cat people. The Cat People(released Dec/42)stars Simone Simon,Kent Smith and Tom Conway. This has Smith falling for Simon and marrying her. But he soon finds that her fears from her past in a small Serbian town get the better of both of them. When he is forced to divorce her the heat ramps up and in the end Simon commits suicide by opening a panther cage. This is a film that ""plays""with the audience. Is the old town ""curse""Simon speaks of real or just in her mind? The wonderful use of shadows and well placed sound effects drive this picture and it remains one of his most powerful today.
The Curse of the Cat People(released March/44)stars,Simone Simon,Kent Smith and Jane Randolph. Smith and his wife from the last film are here again. They now have a young daughter who is very introverted and loves to play alone,in fact making up fictional play friends. When her newest friend becomes Smith's ex from the first film(Simon), everyone gets worried. Is she real or just in the imagination of the girl? This film beautifully explores the mind of a young child and her realistic reactions to every day stimuli.
The second disc has I walked with a Zombie and The Body Snatcher. I Walked With a Zombie(released Mar/43)stars,James Ellison,Frances Dee and Tom Conway. This story concerns a young Canadian nurse who gets a job to care for a lady in the Caribbean. The lady in question appears to be in a constant trance. Before long the nurse is involved with local voodoo superstitions,something she was ill prepared to handle. This film is another Lewton set piece and his lighting and music creates a beautiful and deliciously somber mood.
The Body Snatcher(released May/45)stars,Boris Karloff,Bela Lugosi,Henry Daniell and Edith Atwater. Karloff shines as the unwanted thorn in the side of Daniell. Karloff is the man Daniell has relied on for years to get bodies for teaching purposes. But there is more to this sour relationship than meets the eye. When Daniell can take no more the characters spin wildly out of control until the last terrifying moment. This film works on many levels and Karloff does a superb job as the wretched body snatcher
The third disc finds Isle of the Dead and Bedlam. Isle of the Dead(released Sept/45) stars Boris Karloff and Ellen Drew. This is a tale set during the Greek wars of 1912. Karloff is a well known,but not well liked,general in the Greek army. Because of the amount of dead the plague has broken out all around the battle field. While visiting an island where he wife was buried to pay his respects,he finds the grave has been despoiled. He inquires at a nearby house and he and the occupants soon find out that they are now under quarantine for the plague. There is also some evil presence afoot. Will it take their lives before the plague does? And who or what is this evil? The last question is definitely what keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout most of the film. Another Lewton specialty-misdirection.
Bedlam(released May/46)stars Boris Karloff and Anna Lee. Karloff is the keeper of the local insane asylum. He has the favour of a local society man but his consort is not as kind in her thoughts and actions towards him. When the chance comes Karloff has her committed and she must somehow survive amongst the lunacy and degradation around her. The inmates manage to capture Karloff and put him on ""trial"".When they set him free he is killed,but not by one you expect. Again misdirection rules the day here,as does the superior script and Karloff's presence.
The fourth disc has The Leopard Man and The Ghost Ship. The Leopard Man(released May/43) stars Dennis O'Keefe and Margo. A local talent manager persuades his client to bring a leopard on a leash into a local nightclub as a publicity stunt. The animal escapes and is soon responsible for the death of one young lady. However the deaths don't end there. When they find the body of the leopard outside of town they realize that the leopard has had nothing whatsoever to do with the deaths ,other than the first. Who is it? Will they catch him/her? Again the title has little to do with what you think the plot will consist of. The acting is solid and tension builds beautifully throughout until the climax and the real killer is caught. More of the Lewton touch as the judicious use of sight and sound permeates this film.
Ghost Ship(released Dec/43)stars Richard Dix. Dix welcomes a new third mate onto his ship. Both men have much in common in their background,however Dix's bonhomie and fatherly advice begins to slowly but surely break down over time. When the third mate realizes the captain has a screw loose and men are dying at his hands,he cannot get anyone to help him. Eventually he becomes the captains target. Will he live to tell the tale? This is a Lewton mood piece once again. The title has nothing to do with ghosts of the spiritual kind but of men becoming ghosts within their own skins. The entire cast is running on all eight cylinders.
Disc five contains The 7th Victim and the documentary Shadows in the Dark:The Val Lewton Legacy. The ninth and final film is the 7th Victim(released Aug/43),starring Tom Conway,Jean Brooks,Isabel Jewell and Kim Hunter. This one finds a woman who lives at a boarding school. However her sister who pays the tuition has not done so for the past six months. Something has happened to her sister and she cannot find her. Through a lot of hardship she eventually manages to track her down but it is a sister who has changed and is involved with a devil worshiping society. When the sister wants out of this society they insist she kill herself;the seventh only to do so in the history of the sect. Will her little sister save her in time? Another Lewton mood piece and the clues/red herrings mount up considerably. There is more to every character we come across in this film than meets the eye.
The documentary Shadows in the Dark on this disc is 7l minutes long. I have not watched it yet but look forward to it after I write this. An FYI.This has always been my way,as I do not want documentaries or featurettes to influence my thinking on my reviews whatsoever.
Finally there has been a sixth disc added, and it is the documentary Val Lewton:The Man in the Shadows. This one is about 87 minutes long and is narrated by Martin Scorsese. Again. I look forward to watching it. It seems they have taken the original 2005 release of this set and have just added this disc in on top of it. They have a cream coloured wrap around piece that partly imitates the outside of the original box and holds the extras disc in place.
Technically speaking all films are in full screen mode and are clear and crisp. However many do exhibit periodic defects throughout. Considering their age,this is not unexpected. Each disc is in a separate snap case with two films per disc.
All in all we have a wonderful collection of the major films of a little known producer/writer at RKO.His influence continues to extend to writers ,directors and producers to this day. Lewton made sophisticated and smart ""horror"" films on a shoe string budget. He elevated the most mundane material to a level that had never been done before,or since. And he appears to have put a cadre of talented people around him;directors,writers,actors,etc,to accomplish just that. He used  many of this same staff on most of his pictures he did and they worked wonderfully together. There are very few folks in the industry that could be said to have had such an impact as Lewton,with such little recognition. This set will hopefully change that. 4-4 1/2 stars.",1431907200,2,9502,4.741389728096677

329715,5,6301327977,"As most probably know, this set is fantastic. Val Lewton, producer/novelist/story editor/screenwriter, was a troubled talent, a genius of sorts, who had too much talent and too little direct vision. His films are special, sometimes apparently lost (except to film scholars), and always watchable. ""Cat People"", in fact, is still imminently watchable today, which is amazing, especially since the ads sell it as a straight horror film--we know that it is anything but.
As for the set itself, it's a fantastic offering of classic films. The two documentaries that are included are must-haves for everyone and anyone who really appreciates cinema, with the ""Shadows in the Dark"" documentary being my pick for the most outstanding classic film documentary ever. Even Harlan Ellison and Ramsey Campbell are included.
My ONE major complaint is that ""The Ghost Ship,"" the infamous troubled production that includes perhaps the greatest themes that Lewton ever worked into his filmmaking, has NO commentary or mini-documentary included with it. If ever a film deserved a commentary track, it was this one! And, apparently, they blew it. That would have been the best audio commentary listen. However, the Kim Newman track for ""...Zombie"" is fun, and Friedkin (who blew it big time with his epic failure during the audio commentary for ""The Exorcist,"" of all things) does a decent enough job walking us through ""The Leopard Man"" without just describing everything that is happening on screen (as I remember...). But, overall, a quality picture and sound, and decent enough transfers, plus there are so many classics here: ""The Seventh Victim,"" ""The Ghost Ship,"" ""The Body Snatcher,"" etc. But I cannot believe no commentary for ""The Ghost Ship."" Why? Otherwise, this set is a true keeper.",1386460800,2,1778,5.22027972027972

I did confirm that two other discs out of this collection have no trouble in the aforementioned high definition players, ""Bedlam/Isle of the Dead"" disc, and one other I can't remember which one, so there is something wrong with that disc, I'll of course have to put in for an exchange, maybe, its such a hassle, I want to watch those movies, and I have to print out some sort of return label I believe.

329718,5,6301327977,"This collection is an excellent quality DVD collection of some of the finest psychological horror films in American cinema which have influenced Martin Scorcese, M. Night Shyamalan and most of the best filmmakers in the genre.

Val Lewton used his RKO position earned from working on David O. Selznick's productions to create an ""underground"" B- movie unit that by simply fulfilling the need to deliver a ""horror movie"" to an assigned title was able to create without studio interference a series of great artistic films crafted with love by a troupe that Lewton carefully assembled from friends and colleagues whom he cajoled and encouraged to do what was probably their best work in their careers. This included Robert Wise, Jacques Tourneur, Mark Robson, many others.  Boris Karloff stated that he was enchanted by Lewton and the elegance and sophistication he brought to these productions and responded with what may be his greatest performance ever -  ""The Body Snatcher.""  Many excellent articles and books have been written about the wonderful qualities of these films, but one that is most fascinating is ""Dreams of Darkness"" by J. P Telotte - an extremely complex but brilliant interpretation of the depth and Jungian psychology that is subtly suggested in these masterful films,  which ironically were produced ""under the radar"" by the Lewton unit. These films  are now still remembered even though they were B-movies,  while the ""A movies""  of the time are often forgotten.  It is sad that Lewton did not realize how significant a contribution to cinema he had made when he died.  But his work lives on as an example of a perfected style of filmmaking, especially in ""The Seventh Victim"" and ""I Walked with a Zombie"" which are unparalleled in their use of camera angles, subtle music (by the great Roy Webb) and beautifully atmospheric black and white cinematography.",1383609600,,1878,5.068181818181818
329719,5,6301327977,I would highly recommend this box set to any Lewton fans or anyone who likes a good old fashioned thriller or film noir. Nine films altogether from the famous (or infamous) 'Cat People' and its sequel to titles many of us may not have heard of (such as 'Ghost Ship' which was out of circulation for decades due to legal issues) but are well worth watching and featuring top notch performances from Boris Karloff in rather surprising roles far removed from those he was best remembered for and showing what a great actor he really was.

Lewton was a master of psychological horror whose films have stood the test of time. You get 9 films in this collection along with ""Shadows in the Dark"", the 53-minute Val Lewton documentary presented by director Martin Scorsese. Cat People and Isle of the Dead are confirmed horror classics. I Walked With a Zombie and The Body Snatcher are also highly regarded. Some light extras are provided (almost every film gets a commentary except Isle of the Dead and The Ghost Ship). My only complaints are that the films haven't been remastered from the previous laserdisc or DVD releases and could use some additional bonus content to make it more deluxe. This collection is priced right if you want to own these classic horror films in one set. A Blu-ray set with remastered films and loaded with extras would be an easy 4 stars.

The Val Lewton Horror Collection gets an AAAAA+++++.

The Cat People is one hour and twelve minutes and was released in theaters on December 25, 1942. Basically the story is about Irena Dubrovna who is of Serbian decent. She believes she is from a long line of cat people who believe whenever she has a craving for sex she will turn into this cat person and kill her lover. So when Irena marries Oliver Reed she won't seal the deal with a kiss or sex. And that boys and girls is the movie in a nutshell and even today I still don't understand that movie. Some footnotes about this movie. The Cat People was the first movie produced by Val Lewton. The movie was filmed in eighteen days and look for Alan Napier who played Alfred the Butler from the Batman television show. The Cat People is an interesting movie and gets an A.

I Walked with a Zombie is one hour and eight minutes and was released in theaters on March 17, 1943. The movie is told in first person and it is about a nurse from Canada named Betsy Connell (Frances Dee) and she tells about her time how she once walked with a zombie. She is employed by Paul Holland (Tom Conway) to take care of her zombie like wife Jessica Holland (Christine Gordon). As for the rest of the story it is too confusing to write about and the ending is something weird. You have to go to the Internet Movie Database or en.wikipedia.org to find out the rest. The only thing I hated about this movie was the commentary; due to their British accent I could not understand them and I don't believe they stuck to the movie most of the time. I Walked with a Zombie gets a B.

The Leopard Man is one hour and six minutes and was released in theaters on May 8, 1943. Jerry Manning brings a leopard to Kiki Walker to upstage her rival act Clo-Clo. Clo-Clo uses her castanets to frighten the leopard and the leopard runs away. After the leopard run away there are three deaths and only one is due to the leopard. The other two may or may not be attribute to the leopard and the suspense builds up to the last six minutes of the film. Just like the last two movies Val Lewton keeps you on your seat till the very end of the movie to find out what really happened. By the way the leopard used in this movie is the same on used in the Cat People. The Leopard Man gets an AAA+++.

The 7th Victim is one hour and ten minutes and was released in theaters on August 21, 1943. The story starts of when Mary if summoned to the office of a boarding school where she is attending and finds out that her sister Jacqueline Gibson has not paid the bill in months. Mary quits school and heads to New York City to find her sister. She seeks help from Gregory Ward, a lawyer, to help find Jacqueline. It is somewhere in the middle of the movie that Jacqueline was part of a devil occult and left. The group philosophy is no killing, but six members in the past have left the group and wind up dead; therefore that is where the title of the story comes from. In the end though you are left guessing whether or not she did it. I am not going to say what it is or I would be giving away the rest of the movie. Just like the last three movies are kept on you seat till the end of the movie to find out the whole story. In this movie you might recognize a young Hugh Beaumont who would go on to fame as Fred Ward on Leave It to Beaver. The 7th Victim gets a B+.

The Curse of the Cat People is one hour and nine minutes and was released in theaters on March 2, 1944. This movie is the follow up to the Cat People and is set about six years after Irena Dubrovna death. Oliver Reed and Alice Moore are now married and have a six year old daughter named Amy. Amy is somewhat of a troubled child because she is always day dreaming and has a hard time making friends. One day while Amy is out trying to make friends gets teased and runs into the old house where a retired actress lives with her daughter. She throws Amy a ring and she takes it home where Edward the butler\cook tells Amy it is a wishing ring. Amy sit necks to the family pond and wishes for friend. Irena comes back to life and becomes Amy friend. One day dad finds out about Amy friend, takes her to her room and spanks her for lying. Amy calls for her friends and goes looking for her. In the end Irena saves Amy life. That is sort of the cliff note version. Due to the film running over budget and ran nine days behind schedule. The Curse of the Cat People was the smallest profit margin of all Val Lewton's film. Just like some of his other films, reused sets from the Magnificent Ambersons were used in this film. The Curse of the Cat People is a good but not great movie and gets a B+.

The Body Snatcher is one hour and eighteen minutes and was released in theaters on May 25, 1945. The story is about a body snatcher (played by Boris Karloff) who digs up dead bodies and sell them to Dr. Wolfe MacFarlane so he can use them in his anatomy classes. Cabman John Gray (the body snatcher) starts killing so Dr. Wolfe MacFarlane an adequate spinal specimen to practice for an upcoming operation on a child's back. When he finds out that the dead woman is the street singer and that Gray has also killed Joseph, Wolfe feels he must stop Gray. Also Gray has a secret about Dr. Wolfe that he uses for blackmail. Dr. Wolfe visits Gray to bribe him to just go away and refuses the bribe. A fight develops and Dr. Wolfe kills John Gray. That is not the ending of the movie and I don't want to give away the rest of the movie. Also there is more to the movie and I gave the edited version the Body Snatcher. This movie would mark the last time that Boris Karloff and Bla Lugosi would be pared together. Some of the scenes were left over sets from the Hunchback of Notre Dame. The only thing I did not like about this movie was the commentary by Steve Haberman and Robert Wise. Robert Wise more or less talks about his career with RKO and Val Lewton and Steve Haberman talks about the movie but only for fifteen minutes of the film though he is on longer. The Body Snatcher is a good suspense horror film and gets an AAAA++++.

Bedlam is one hour and nineteen minutes and was released in theaters on May 10, 1946. Bedlam is based on William Hogarth's A Rake's Progress, and a hospital in England. The movie is set in 1761 England and is about St. Mary's of Bethlehem Asylum. Master George Sims (Boris Karloff) runs the asylum and treats the patients with cruelty. Master George Sims tricks Lord Mortimer into sending Nell Bowen into the asylum because she wants to make reforms. In the end Master George Sims is put on trial by the inmates he mistreats and Nell is helped into escaping by one of the patients. Bedlam would mark Val Lewton last movie with RKO Studios and his first movie not to make a profit. Also this movie would be the last paring of Boris Karloff and Val Lewton. Also this is the only Val Lewton movie to have a happy ending. Bedlam is a good movie to watch though is does not have the previous suspense as his other movies. Bedlam gets an AAAA++++.

By today's standards these films may seem slow, but for those of us who enjoyed them growing up in the '60's & '70's watching them on TV, we can once again return to our youth and see what kept us glued to ""Chiller Theater"" & ""Creature Features"" and all those campy venues that introduced us to these gems.",1363132800,,436,4.602564102564102

This film has the psychological complexity of a Val Lewton production but is a lot more graphic than most of his productions where he just implies violence.  He even takes it out on innocent dogs. I feel that some one was pushing Lewton from behind to be more vicious with this film.

A young student (Russell Wade) wants to become a doctor like the great Dr. Wolfe 'Toddy' MacFarlane (Henry Daniell.) Little does he know what it will entail?

But the product page shows ""Shannon Tweed (Actor), Sam Hennings (Actor), Kelley Cauthen (Director)"".  Now Shannon Tweed, for example, was born six years after Val Lewton died, so it's unlikely you'll find her on any of these titles.
Amazon, I know this isn't the fault of your database, as the WB store has the same errors for this product. And actually, as of today, 1/6/12,  there seem to be hundreds of titles here that mistakenly show Shannon and the others in the credits. I hope they can cash their residuals checks before the error is discovered.

Update 1/18/12: Amazon has, at my submitted suggestion, corrected the problem I described for this title (except that they show Robert Wise as an actor). I appreciate them responding so quickly. However, there is still a database issue with Warner Bros titles, and I know it's not Amazon's fault. Do a search for ""Shannon Tweed"" and you'll see her credited on such films as V for Vendetta, Sergeant York, Blazing Saddles, Mrs. Miniver, The Dirty Dozen, Matrix, The Tracy and Hepburn Signature Collection,  American in Paris, and many, many more.",1357430400,,1188,4.925

329813,5,6301327977,"I devoured these movies in just a few days once I received the set from Amazon. The B-grade-sounding titles of these movies are totally misleading, because these are not some cheapo B-grade schlock horror, but very classy, very imaginative and very understated films about psychological terror. Well, they were 'cheapo"" because RKO gave Lewton only small budgets to work with and thus, he had to be imaginative about using sounds and shadows to create terrifying moods in lieu of special effects. I Walked With a Zombie is a masterpiece, and so are Cat People and its ""sequel"" (it has returning characters but the storyline essentially has nothing to do with its predecessor). And all the ones with Boris Karloff are a revelation of the late actor's incredible talent. What a fine actor, and what an amazing voice he had!

In the documentary, Man in the Shadows, a very informative film about Lewton, how he worked, his life inside and outside the studios, Scorsese tells us that Lewton originally had reservations when he was asked to make a film with Karloff, because the legendary producer wasn't going to make a horror movie with an actor lumbering around in heavy make-up. But Lewton soon discovered that Karloff had real acting chops, and so did I after viewing Bedlam, Isle of the Dead and The Body Snatcher. In The Body Snatcher he manages to disgust us with his character and at the same time also make us sympathise with him. In Bedlam, he is both creepy and despicable.

The I Walked With a Zombie/The Body Snatcher disc was defective, but Amazon was prompt to give me a 25% refund so that I could purchase a replacement disc separately from the box set. Kudos to the fine service, Amazon!",1356825600,,1700,4.759322033898305

I think this movie shows that talent will out.  That a good artist takes the technology he has and makes good art with it.

The old black and white images are art in themselves and lend them selves to the eeriest atmosphere since Nosferatu. The stylized acting gives the whole film an aura of brooding menace.  I personally think this was  the scariest thing that Boris Karloff ever did.  I think it shows that monsters do not have to be super powered or supernatural to  be horrifying.

It is probably not a film for younger people, but if you are a mature person who can appreciate material of different nature from a bygone age, this is a forgotten gem and well worth a viewing.",1354838400,,847,4.562913907284768
329816,5,6301327977,"After Orson Welles nearly bankrupt RKO studios with his acclaimed but financially disastrous CITIZEN KANE and THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, studio heads were eager to find a profitable but low budget answer to UNIVERSAL STUDIOS highly profitable MONSTER/HORROR movies.
They turned to Val Lewton to head what they thought would be a competing horror film series. What they got was highly profitable and popular despite their status as low budget ""B"" horror films. In the end, Lewton's low budget films exceeded Universal's films in both creativity, quality and story. Lewton worked well with a budget that was often 1/3 or less of an ""A"" film. He reused some of Welles's sets for his own movies. Contract players were recycled through the 9 movies Lewton made. He created ""horror"" stories not by using monsters and creatures but rather by playing on our fear of the unknown--a fear that is often greater than the fear of something known. Fear is in our minds and Lewton and his writers played up that fear. Most of the films take place at night and in the shadows--much like film noir classics. The fear of what lurks in the shadows terrifies us yet calls to us.

Here is a remarkable collection of those 9 RKO horror films all together in one set. I will review the individual films separately but just want to talk about the collection as a whole. This set has two films per disc on 4 discs. The final disc has one film and the documentary SHADOWS IN THE DARK THE VAL LEWTON LEGACY. As a bonus, a 6th disc was included containing the documentary MARTIN SCORSESE PRESENTS VAL LEWTON THE MAN IN THE SHADOWS.

Fans will have favorites in this set and some that aren't as appealing. It can be a matter of taste. I tended to like the films better that were set in the current times rather than the period piece films. Again, we can all agree to disagree but I can say I enjoyed every film for various reasons. Each movie has a bonus feature of a commentary by film historians which provide immense insight into each film.

329853,5,6301327977,"It would come as no surprise to Val Lewton that even after 60 years his movies are still being marketed as horror films. That was how they first came into being. He surely would be surprised and thrilled that they are so highly regarded today for at the end of his short life (he died at 46), he viewed his life with some regret and his career as a failure. They are horror films in name only especially by today's standards but that has always been the case even in the 1940s when they first appeared. As has often been proclaimed elsewhere, they are dark psychological dramas with occasional supernatural overtones. They are film noir before film noir became fashionable. While some of the look of the films was on account of the tight budgets, there is no question that they have the appearance that Val Lewton wanted. If you ever get the opportunity to read FEARING THE DARK: THE VAL LEWTON CAREER by Edmund G. Bansak, you will see excerpts from Val Lewton's early writing style which says in words what his movies would later visualize.

This set is the same as the 2005 one with the exception of the new documentary narrated by Martin Scorsese. It goes hand in hand with the original documentary SHADOWS IN THE DARK. As another reviewer stated, be sure and save the documentaries for last so that the surprise elements of the films won't be given away. Also watch the original documentary first. Even though they are not coupled on the DVDs this way, the ideal method for watching the films is in the order that they were made so that you can see how they evolved and watch how the supporting players switch characters and personalities over the course of the nine films. The original order is 1) CAT PEOPLE, 2) I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, 3) THE LEOPARD MAN, 4) THE 7TH VICTIM, 5) THE GHOST SHIP, 6) THE CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE, 7) ISLE OF THE DEAD, 8) THE BODY SNATCHER, 9) BEDLAM.

329855,4,6301327977,"During Hollywood's so-called Golden Era, no one surpassed Russian-born, former pulp writer Val Lewton in the skin-crawly, arty, supernatural B-movie producer niche.  Producer Lewton's deal with RKO gave him free reign if he could make movies for under $200,000 with a grabby title and a tight edit of around 70 minutes.  His films are now considered classics (and not just with cult collectors).  Nine of his best, in good-looking transfers, are in this set (two per disc): I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, THE LEOPARD MAN, THE SEVENTH VICTIM, THE GHOST SHIP, THE BODY SNATCHER (there's a scene with Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi), ISLE OF THE DEAD, BEDLAM (look for the pre psycho shower scene) and my favorites: CAT PEOPLE, and the follow-up CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE starring the beautiful, mysterious Simone Simon.

Three of the nine titles are new on DVD.  There's a wonderful commentary with Simon on CAT PEOPLE and CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE.  The late Robert Wise offers his insights on THE BODY SNATCER.  Among the extras is a fascinating new documentary about Lewton and his low budget, visually sophisticated films with directors Jacques Tourneur, Mark Robson and Robert Wise.

Martin Scorsese's documentary praising the art of the low budget films of Lewton was first broadcast on TCM and preserves the integrity of the ""Man in the Shadows"" and reinforces what can be done with a little imagination and a great story.",1290297600,,1415,4.940928270042194
329856,5,6301327977,"I recommend you buy the revised version of this collection, which contains a great documentary about Lewton by Martin Scorcese.

After RKO's dismal failure with movies such as The Magnificent Ambersons and Citizen Kane, they were looking for a director who wasn't a troublesome genius, but someone who would make them money. Val Lewton was their answer. But unexpectedly, Lewton made quality films that were especially notable for their lack of special effects and makeup (as compared to the Universal machine, which was turning out movies like Frankenstein and the Wolfman). Using only lighting, music, acting and plots, Val Lewton produced some of the best classic horror ever made.

For example, his first film was ""Cat People."" With no money for special effects, he could have made a terrible movie with people in a bunch of cheap cat suits. Instead, you have a movie in which no one is ever seen on screen turning into a cat; with shadows, editing, and sound effects, he created the illusion of seeing people transform. The result was a stylish, sexually sophisticated, film noir horror movie with a riveting love story at its center. It was a box office smash, and RKO gave Lewton the freedom to make eight more classic horror films, all of which are contained in both boxed sets. His career was tragically short, dying of heart disease at just 46, but Val Lewton transformed the horror genre. Watch how he did it.",1286582400,,1420,4.863636363636363
329857,5,6301327977,"There are two versions of this collection; I recommend this one because of the additional documentary by Martin Scorcese, unavailable in the first.

After RKO's dismal failure with movies such as The Magnificent Ambersons and Citizen Kane, they were looking for a director who wasn't a troublesome genius, but someone who would make them money. Val Lewton was their answer. But unexpectedly, Lewton made quality films that were especially notable for their lack of special effects and makeup (as compared to the Universal machine, which was turning out movies like Frankenstein and the Wolfman). Using only lighting, music, acting and plots, Val Lewton produced some of the best classic horror ever made.

The studio would give him a title, and it was Lewton's job to put a movie to it. RKO gave Lewton terribly small budgets and he had to use the sets and standing casts of contract players that were already available at RKO. They had no horror properties to speak of, so Lewton was left to use his wits to create terror and suspense. Using leftover talent from other divisions, Lewton put together his team; fortunately for Lewton, with RKO nearly bankrupt, there were many excellent cinematographers, editors, and other crew members looking for films to work on.

Determined not to fall to the level of such titles as ""I Walked with a Zombie,"" Lewton looked for ways to create quality films under the most difficult circumstances.

His first film was ""Cat People,"" for which he threw out the treatment given to him. With no money for special effects, he could have made a terrible movie with people in a bunch of cheap cat suits. Instead, you have a movie in which no one is ever seen on screen turning into a cat; with shadows, editing, and sound effects, he created the illusion of seeing people transform. The result was a stylish, sexually sophisticated, film noir horror movie with a riveting love story at its center. Psychological horror was unknown before Cat People, but Val Lewton created a hit movie that explored the psyche in ways that would have been censored had the topics been treated directly, but which worked brilliantly and made it past the censors tucked away in a horror story about physical transformation. Cat People was held over at major New York theaters, and the receipts earned Lewton the freedom to do whatever he liked.

What followed was eight more horror films, all of which are in this boxed set. Unfortunately, Lewton died of heart disease in his mid-forties, so his career was short, but the horror genre would never be the same after Lewton.",1286582400,,2583,4.861363636363636
329858,4,6301327977,"I bought this set when it first came out in 2008, but only removed the celophane this weekend and have already watched six of them. If you are not familiar with producer Val Lewton or the horror films he supervised at RKO, you are in for a treat. While they are definitely horrifying and more than a little creepy, the type of product Lewton cranked out for the studio relied more on psychological fright and man's inner phobias than necessarily the blood and gore stuff usually associated with the genre. They are all moody and dark and have a sinister feel to them. What makes his style of horror really special was that Lewton managed to crank this stuff out on a tight budget and the overall effect was something far more sophisticated than the cheesy sets and backdrops would suggest. Curiously, many of his 'star' players didn't have fabulous careers but are remembered for their riveting performances in these films.
Of the films recently watched, the only one which sort of fell flat toward the end was The Leopard Man. The Ghost Ship was surprisingly good. Richard Dix managed to turn in a great performance as a twisted sea captain and really rose above my expectations.
While the individual features offer little to nothing in terms of bonus features, the Scorcese documentary on Lewton is quite good. If you are a fan of horror or cinema noirish features, you may find this interesting.",1280707200,2,1398,4.733606557377049

I know most people of my generation and younger wouldn't even give films like this a chance based on there age and being B&W, but of course that is what makes them so wonderful, the shadows, mood and tension of the films would never work in color.

329902,4,6301327977,"What a great collection.

I already wrote something about ""Cat People"" on its own DVD page at Amazon, but I wanted to say a couple of things about ""The Seventh Victim,"" which is one of the bleakest films I've ever seen.

It begins with a Metaphysical poem about death (""I run to death and death meets me as fast / And all my pleasures are like yesterday"") and never lets up.

A woman is reported missing, and her younger sister (played by Kim Hunter) goes to Greenwich Village looking for her - but not before the (dreary) boarding school administrators tell Hunter (an orphan) never to return.

Hunter discovers her sister's apartment contains nothing but a chair, over which is a hanging noose.  And there's a murder. And a satanic cult.  And two creepy guys on a subway with a corpse. And a dying neighbor.  And three people in love with objects of desire they can't have.  And an attempt to get someone to commit suicide.  And a shower scene that momentarily seems to anticipate the famous scene in ""Psycho.""  And then there's that ending.

And all of this occurs in just a little over an hour!",1250985600,,1098,4.522842639593908
329903,4,6301327977,"This collection of films will NOT:
1.  make you sick at the sight of all the gore (there really isn't any)
2.  make you laugh at silly monster costumes (there aren't any)
3.  make you pull the DVD out of the machine.
4.  make you blush at teenage girls with skimpy costumes.

This collection will:
1.  Generate some real suspense and mystery
2.  Demonstrate how to make a really good movie without millions spent on special effects.
3.  Appeal to your adult imagination and experience
4.  Surprise you at just how good the movies are without the hype given other films contemporary to these.
5.  Leave you satisfied that you haven't thrown your money away.

While 40's suspense films aren't for everybody, those who do appreciate a subtle but relentless aproach to building real mystery will thoroughly enjoy the Val Lewton collection.

For years, I thought I rememberd Simone Simone changing into a cat in ""Cat People.""  Upon rewatching, she did but it was never necessary to show that transformation on the screen.  Instead, ""Cat People"" generates even more suspense by not telling the viewer everything.  This is perhaps the best example of how to make a simple horror film without making it rediculous.  I would give this one film 5 stars if it were out of the set.

The other films are also rewarding.  They build suspense without a lot blood or graphic violence.  ""The 7th Victim"" is a very scary film about a devil worshipping cult, once again, without a lot of blood or violence.  ""I Walked with a Zombie"" presents perhaps the strangest film in the group.  A woman has been mesmerized by the zombie cult on her island and it seems nothing can free her from her trans-like state.  Night walks and strange folks keep the atmosphere perfect for knowledgable film fan.  ""Bedlam"" is one of Boris Karloff's best films AND it's a woman's picture (Anna Lee).  The same can be said for Cat People, Curse of the Cat People, The 7th Victim, and I Walked with a Zombie.  The only real letdown might have been ""The Ghost Ship"" but it's still a nice 3-star mystery.  As for the other films, they hit the mark too.

Recommended for:  serious suspense fans, Simone Simone fans, 1940's B&W film fans, not too horrific horror fans.",1247011200,5,2221,4.669250645994832
329904,3,6301327977,"People are always talking about Val Lewton and though he may be the driving force behind these movies it was Jaques Tourneur's visual genius that made the movies great. How do  I know? Just look at the movies Lewton produced and Tourneur didn't direct, so it's high time that these movies are called Jacques Tourneur movies and not Val Lewton movies. Maybe it's the general American distaste for the French? I don't know of any other example that a series of movies are consistently referred to by their producer and not their director. Lewton may have had the ideas but it was Tourneur that made said three movies into the classics that they are, so three stars for the brilliance of Tourneur, zero stars for the other crappy movies.",1235174400,3,734,4.689922480620155

329906,5,6301327977,"This is an excellent collection of the ""horror"" titles produced by Val Lewton for RKO.  Note that despite some confusion over the contents, this set contains all nine of the titles contained in another box set currently offered by Amazon.  The difference is the inclusion of the Scorsese documentary in this one.

Modern horror movie fans may avoid disappointed expectations by keeping in mind the adage to not judge a book by its cover...or in this case a Val Lewton movie by its title.  ""Ghost Ship"", for example, contains no supernatural elements, and the ""zombie"" movie here has no resemblence to its modern and gory counterparts.  In Lewton's movies, a colorful title is depicted as a series of ambiguous events that may be the result of characters' perceptions rather than a blatant monster rampage.

Don't compare these to either modern horror movies or the classic Universal-type monster movies like ""Dracula"" or ""Frankenstein"".  These movies are moody psychological thrillers and seem more closely related to the Film Noir crime genre...and indeed the directors of several of these titles went on to make Noir classics.

That said, these movies are, for the most part, extremely well-made.  Other reviews give good descriptions of the individual titles, but my personal favorites are:
Cat People (the closest to a traditional monster movie, great cinematography);
I Walked With a Zombie (a very eerie setting with a Jane Eyre-esque story);
The Body Snatcher (wonderful showpiece for Boris Karloff who is all malice in this one); and
Isle of the Dead (Karloff delivers a memorable character again and another eerie setting to savor).

Not all the movies are winners, and sometimes the acting gets a little stiff.  Nevertheless these these are unique movies that emphasize mood and subtlety rather than explicitness, and this is a teriffic box set.",1232496000,3,1855,5.15
329907,5,6301327977,Thanks amazon for the great product. Order reached correct on time. Keep up the good work. I will do more trandactions with your site.,1230595200,,134,4.625
329908,5,6301327977,"A film in which ""entertainment"" at a party is provided by inmates from the local insane asylum, so the nobility at the party can laugh at them and ridicule their, of course, pathetic performances, and then a beautiful, perfectly sane woman is sent to the asylum for punitive reasons by the nobility - I found that more frightening than a story about an invasion of vampires or battles between werewolves and zombies, etc. The insane asylum story is the plot in ""Bedlam"", set in 18th century Britain, and one of the 9 Val Lewton films in this set.

Maybe the only one that really has a strong supernatural aspect is ""Cat People"", but even in that the supernatural element is very low key. In these movies, the ""horror"" is primarily based on the eerie things that some people do and the strangeness that can lurk within the human mind. The scariness lies in the weird subject matter and Val's outstanding knowledge of the tricks of cinema for producing fear.

Another way these are different than your standard horror films is the extent of the character development. Lewton always works to present these people as real and to go to lengths to show their real lives, jobs, and such.

The lack of relation of the title of some of these films to their actual story is hilarious. The titles were imposed on Lewton by the studio, and he would be told to make a movie to fit the title, but he stretched it to the max. The studio went along because they were getting good box office. They were very profitable, so the studio gave him leeway.

""The Curse of the Cat People"" was the sequel to ""Cat People"", but has nothing to do with either a curse or cat people. It's about a little girl who sees a picture of  her father's deceased wife (who was the cat woman in ""Cat People"") and develops her as an imaginary friend. It's a psychological study of imaginary friends and has been used in college psychology classes.

""I Walked With A Zombie"". Yes there a couple of zombies, but they are not your traditional sorts of zombies. They weren't brought back from the dead, but were voodoo-created from living people. The strength of the story is in the witty script and the character development, not some outrageous science fiction about zombies.

""The Body Snatcher"", ""Isle Of The Dead"", and ""Bedlam"" all star Boris Karloff, who gives surprisingly good performances.  You can see he was really a very good actor. ""Body snatcher"" is a story of a doctor who relies on the Karloff character to dig up bodies from graves so his medical students can have cadavers to dissect. This is arguably Karloff's best performance ever. He is outstanding in ""Bedlam"" as well. ""Island of the Dead"" involves a group quarrantined on a little island because they have been exposed to the plague. Superstitious beliefs by some aggravate the tensions, but in the end that's all they are - superstitions, with no basis I reality.

""The 7th Victim"" is about a young woman who gets caught up in a group of devil worshippers in Greenwich Village. You have to laugh when you see these devil worshippers - strictly high class, middle aged, well-dressed folks who look like the cream of society. Not at all the way devil worshippers are portrayed today.

""Leopard Man"" is not about a man who changes into a leopard. It's about a small town living in fear of an escaped leopard. A few people have been killed, apparently by the cat, but was it in fact the cat that did it?

""The Ghost Ship"" is not about ghosts in any way. It's about a mad ship captain who has strange ideas about leading.

In addition to the 9 movies, the set contains two documentaries about Val Lewton and these movies. These are: ""Shadows In The Dark"" and ""Martin Scorsese Presents Val Lewton, The Man In The Shadows"". The latter is on a separate disc and contains good commentary from Scorsese, but in fact it was written and directed by Kent Jones.

Henry Daniell as Dr. MacFarlane runs a medical school in his home and uses the recently dead for his experiments and lessons. He acquires the dead from a cabman, John Gray, beautifully played by Karloff, in an ethically repulsive but morally justified business relationship.
The Body Snatcher is excellently directed (by a young Robert Wise) and shot in a simple, dingy, claustrophobic, shadow filled Ediburgh of 1831, and though it features many accents, several American at that, the acting is very taut. The story, by Robert Louise Stevenson plugs along twisting Dr. MacFarlane and Gray more and more to the edges of madness and murder.
This is highly recommended for a smart story, wonderful performances, especially by Boris Karloff and Henry Daniell, sharp images with strong shadows and bleak moods and a terrific ending that is positively Poe-esque.

p.s. Bela Legosi has a featured part as Dr. MacFarlane's servant, shifting about quietly and eavesdropping on the dirty goings-on. He and Karloff have a scene together that, but for it's short length is wonderfully creepy.",1216425600,2,1238,5.252525252525253

The documentary will be available separately for just under twenty dollars for people who already own the other five discs as part of original Val Lewton Collection.

Val Lewton is not a well known name in the horror genre for most people. Everyone knows about Universal's reputation in horror during the 1930's and 1940's even though, today, most of those early monster films have dated rather badly, though they still retain an atmosphere that makes them worth watching. Lewton came to RKO in the 1940's and had a very brief output of high quality films. He was pretty much given ready-made titles and his job was to turn a profit for the studio, not make art. Strangely enough, though, he managed to do both and came up with a series of films that retain an interesting psychological aspect even today. Thus he is often called the producer of ""the thinking person's horror films"".

If you haven't already bought the Val Lewton Horror Collection, wait and get the new expanded one. If you already bought this set, you can either pick up the documenary separately, or you can just watch the documentary when it premieres on Turner Classic Movies on January 14 2008 at 8PM (EST).

The documentary will be available separately for just under twenty dollars for people who already own the other five discs as part of original Val Lewton Collection.

Val Lewton is not a well known name in the horror genre for most people. Everyone knows about Universal's reputation in horror during the 1930's and 1940's even though, today, most of those early monster films have dated rather badly, though they still retain an atmosphere that makes them worth watching. Lewton came to RKO in the 1940's and had a very brief output of high quality films. He was pretty much given ready-made titles and his job was to turn a profit for the studio, not make art. Strangely enough, though, he managed to do both and came up with a series of films that retain an interesting psychological aspect even today. Thus he is often remembered as the producer of ""the thinking person's horror films"".

If you haven't already bought the Val Lewton Horror Collection, wait and get this expanded one. If you have, you can either pick up the documenary separately, or you can just watch the documentary when it premieres on  Turner Classic Movies on January 14th at 8PM (EST). From the Warner Press Release: ""Scorsese and writer/director Kent Jones take the viewer on a journey into the life and psyche of the man who left his mark in film history through the creation of such timeless thrillers as I Walked with a Zombie, Cat People and The Body Snatcher, to name but a few. The new documentary features insightful analysis, on-screen interviews with Lewton collaborators, and, best of all, an abundance of classic Lewton film clips.""",1193443200,61,1831,4.82484076433121
329991,4,6301327977,"The Ghost Ship is a real clunker. It underlines the skill of a director and cast who can produce tension, interest and mystery by showing what happens when that skill is absent.

All the rest, though, are marvellous entertainment and, in my view, fine pictures. The set is good value and money well spent.",1191974400,4,305,4.648148148148148
329992,5,6301327977,"While the plots alone are enough to distinguish Lewton's brand of horror from other practitioners--a mysterious Serbian beauty might or might not have the ability to transform herself into a panther in ""Cat People,"" a death-haunted New York woman is pursued by a cabal of satanists in ""The Seventh Victim""--these films are also masterpieces of noir atmospherics. Karloff, an intellectual bored by ghoulish makeup, emerged from semi-retirement to make three pictures with Lewton: ""Bedlam,"" ""The Body Snatcher,"" and ""The Isle of the Dead,"" with Bela Lugosi. It was a fruitful relationship. And this omnibus collection amply demonstrates Lewton's pulpy, lurid genius.",1182729600,2,664,5.584158415841584
329993,4,6301327977,"Director Robert Wise using two giants of the horror genre Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi created a worthy tale of terror based on a Robert Louis Stevenson short story, ""The Body Snatcher"".  This macabre flick takes place in 1831 Edinburgh when the study of anatomy and medicine existed in a primitive stage.

Eminent doctor and professor of a school of anatomy Dr. Macfarlane played by a prim, authoritative Henry Daniell must resort to grave robbing to provide cadavers for dissection.  Long time acquaintance cabman John Gray played by a sneering Karloff has long been the supplier of these unearthed corpses. Due to their complicity in this gruesome business Karloff has a hold over the prestigious doctor.

Laws have been passed which attempt to cut down on the frequent desecration of gravesites.  Dr. Macfarlane's prize student and assistant Mr. Fettes played by a naive Russel Wade has been given the job of dealing with Karloff.  When Macfarlane decides to undertake a delicate operation on the spine of a crippled young girl, he needs fresh cadavers on which to practice.  Fettes becomes aware that Karloff, unable to dig up graves. has resorted to killing to provide fresh bodies.  He's told by Macfarlane to look the other way.

Lugosi playing the doctor's assistant Joseph, a bit part for him, schemes to blackmail Karloff when learning of his murderous ways.  Needless to say, this 1945 film concludes in dire fashion for the bad guys.",1168992000,3,1447,4.991666666666666
329994,5,6301327977,"I've read the other reviews, and agree with most. Still, my favorite is ""Curse of the Cat People"". I've always been fascinated by (good) films that see life through the eyes of a child. Next to ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", I can't think of another film that brought me back to those simple, sweet times that adults just didn't get! (Except for Atticus, of course). I was also annoyed that the collection was in a tall box that would never fit on my shelf; I hate to separate them to fit on my shelf, alphabetically. Lewton had that wonderful idea, realized by Tourneur, with the glorious black & white photography, crisp and clear as a bell, and much appreciated by those of us who love outstanding film-making. I enjoy this collection a lot, but wish I could put it on the shelf with my other ""collections"", in a nice box.",1162166400,4,819,4.466666666666667

""Curse of the Cat People"" and ""The Seventh Victim"" are largely unknown but the best and most subtle of these works.

329996,5,6301327977,"Val Lewton's productions have long been treasured by cinematic aestheticians. This accrues not only from his singularly intelligent treatment and subtle presentation of macabre themes, but from his recurring Lewton ""stock company"" of players. How we Lewton devotees savor the return of Jane Randolph, Jean Brooks, Isabel Jewell, Russell Wade, Sir Lancelot, Tom Conway, Ottola Nesmith ! etc. etc.

Less noted perhaps, are the recurring props to be spotted in Lewton films. Thus, Ottola Nesmith's tufted Victorian sofa from ""The Leopard Man,"" later becomes the property of Miss Julia Dean in ""Curse of the Cat People."" Likewise, Miss Nesmith's daughter in the same film, (""Teresa"") sleeps in the same curly maple bed destined to later belong to little Ann Carter in ""Curse..."".

Many other Lewton props follow this same recycling pattern, i.e., Kim Hunter in ""Seventh Victim,"" turns up in that film's cocktail party sequence sporting Jane Randolph's fur trimmed topcoat from ""Cat People""; the exterior double doors to Simone Simon's ""Cat People"" brownstone apartment building do double duty as the entrance to a hotel in ""Seventh Victim,"" as well as serving as portals to the museum in ""Leopard Man.""

These delightful economies, however, may have more to do with RKO than Mr. Lewton, since Julia Dean's Victorian chairs may also be spotted in the non Lewton productions, ""Beware My Lovely"" and ""Experiment Perilous.""",1156896000,3,1415,5.308035714285714
329997,5,6301327977,"""The Val Lewton Horror Collection"" is the quintessential prize to any serious classic horror collector's DVD library.  With the atmospheric classics ""Cat People"" and it's sequel ""Curse of the Cat People,"" as two of the most familiar of the nine films presented here.  Both films deal with the lovely Simone Simon, as an ill-fated woman who has the ability to turn herself into a black panther!  ""The Cat People"" makes the most sense of the two, however, ""Curse of the Cat People"" has an atmospheric beauty to it, almost like a dream in its presentation.  Both are very enjoyable. ""I Walked With a Zombie"" is probably the most coveted of the collection, for it's subject matter dealing with voodoo, a love triangle, and the hauntingly beautiful woman who is drawn to the voodoo cult by their jungle drums, is highly entertaining throughout.  ""The Body Snatcher"" featuring the diabolical Boris Karloff as a grave robbing ghoul is also of high merit in this collection.  ""Isle of the Dead"" also features the great Karloff, leading a small band of people who quarantine themselves on a small island due to the plague.  A superstition by one of the women arises fear in Karloff that the beautiful girl among them may be a vampire!  Karloff returns once more as the head master of an English asylum in ""Bedlam.""  A young woman wants to help the poor people of the asylum, but is wrongfully committed by Karloff.  ""Bedlam"" contains an ending that is both suspenseful and humorous; (one of the patients keeps suggesting Wise Solomon's solution of ""cut him into."")  ""The Leopard Man"" is also a nice addition, with a change of scenery.  Instead of the usual English settings consisting of fog and thunderstorms, we are given a Mexican village that is plagued with a possible ""leopard man"" which is supported by the local superstitious of the village.  ""The Ghost Ship"" is somewhat entertaining, but not as rich in it's story as the before mentioned.  And last, but not least is the cult driven ""The Seventh Victim"" with a young woman trying to locate her missing sister who she discovers had dealings with a satanic cult.  The documentary of ""Shadows in the Dark"" gives great insight to the making of these classic films and is a nice added addition to the set.

While watching these supernatural masterpieces, several other movies of similar origin came to mind.  It would be great to have these horror classics on dvd as well: ""Island of Lost Souls"" (1933), which is the original telling of the ""Island of Dr. Moreau"" with men being changed into beasts!  ""The Leech Woman"" (1960) featuring the old seeking the secrets of the youth in this jungle voodoo classic.  ""The Uninvited"" (1944) with Ray Milland and Ruth Hussey dealing with supernatural goings-on in their new house, which turns out to be haunted!  ""The Woman in White"" (1948) with the lovely Eleanor Parker possessed by some strange presence and co-starring Gig Young and the legendary Agnes Moorehead.  And the third installment to the original Vincent Price ""The Fly"" movies, ""The Curse of the Fly"" (1965).  It's not up to par as it's two predecessors, but it quite entertaining and would be fun to have on dvd!  I hope to see these, as well as others given the same high quality treatment as ""The Val Lewton Horror Collection,"" for it is truly a gem in my dvd library.",1153440000,7,3322,4.779334500875657

I imagine that many jaded young horror fans will find little to entertain them in these movies, but those who appreciate subtlety will love their eerie atmospheric charm. Of the group, Cat People might be the most artful, but the closed door scene from The Leopard Man stays with you long after the movie is over, and Boris Karloff's menacing cabman in The Body Snatcher is a pitch-perfect performance that chills and delights. I Walked with a Zombie is a Jane Eyre story that beautifully echoes key points of the original Victorian novel while deftly weaving a story of voodoo and tainted love in the tropics. The best elements of these films are their ability to convey horror without being graphic and their refusal to answer the viewer's nagging doubts about what really happened. We are left to wonder what was real and what we only feared to be real, and THAT is a chill that lingers long after the lights come up again.",1139529600,6,1057,4.627659574468085
330044,1,6301327977,"I love the atmospheric work done by Lewton, Robson, Tourneur, Wise, et al. But I'm disappointed in these DVDs.

Worst of all, I cannot even watch 'The Body Snatcher' beyond the first 15 minutes because a defect in the disc prevents it from being played. This has happened on multiple drives, and the disc was never mishandled. Yet fine scratches and pits are visible on this disc, and to a lesser extent on other discs in the set. Plus, all these DVD discs are surprisingly flimsy (like the very cheapest of CD-R discs).

So far I have viewed 3 full movies using these DVDs, and during each one, the drive has ""stuck"" at least once during playback -- though no intervention was necessary to continue playback. (I'm not counting 'The Body Snatcher' which required that the disc be ejected.)

Aside from the physical defects, I am also disappointed in the quality of the ""restoration"" -- but I do not believe that all the imaging is of equally poor quality across the discs. As I recall, 'Seventh Victim' and 'Walked with a Zombie' looked quite good. But 'Bedlam' looked and sounded awful, and what little I experienced of the 'Body Snatcher' was also very disappointing in both appearance and sound. In fact, the VHS I viewed years ago might have looked better than this DVD (at least the VHS was playable all the way through).

The trailers look even worse. Perhaps the trailers were damaged because they were circulated and screened more than the actual feature films. Or maybe the feature films were slightly restored -- but I doubt that.

I also doubt if the manufacturer bothered to contact all the possible sources to find the cleanest prints of these films.",1136937600,21,1663,4.720689655172414

Full of speckles, static, fadings and the like--this is a set that sets a new low for digital re mastering. If any. These are allegedly classic repros from the originals.  But they are not.  One only has to match the dvd versions against the LASER DISC versions--and the proof is in the pudding.  Technically the source material seems to be Grade Z.

Prints used in this collection are uniformly poor. Obviously no restoration was attempted at all on these films. The RKO Collection vhs tape from the nineties of ""Bedlam"" looks better than the print in this collection. All of the films in the box set show more than their age-they show wear and poor handling to the point of being distracting to the viewer.

I was thrilled when the set was announced, but honestly now I wish I had held off on buying it and just transferred my vhs copies to disc. I would have been no worse off. While the commentaries are always a bonus I could have done without them and spent my money more wisely.

If you haven't seen these films they are definitely a must. But be aware-fancy box set or not-they are evidently still being relegated to the 'spook show' ghetto.",1135555200,24,998,4.502762430939226
330047,5,6301327977,"Back in the early 1940s, RKO was financially reeling due to the excesses of Orson Welles.  The studio needed some money makers, and seeing Universal's success with its monster movies, decided to go along a similar route.  RKO brought in producer Val Lewton, gave him some movie titles and told him to make movies based on those titles.  What Lewton produced were some well-made ""B"" movies which became minor classics of the horror genre.  This boxed set has all nine of those Lewton-produced movies.

I tend to divide these movies into two loose groups (with one standalone movie that fits in neither):  the Tourneur group and the Karloff group.  The first of the Jacques Tourneur-directed movies is Cat People, and immediately with this first film, Lewton and Tourneur were hits.  Cat People is a top-notch thriller about a Serbian woman who believes that she is under a curse:  any sexual arousal will transform her into a murderous panther.  With limited effects (and Code-imposed censorship), most of the horror (and sexual tension) is implied rather than seen, but it nonetheless works excellently.

The awkwardly named I Walked With a Zombie is not nearly as cheesy as it sounds.  It is, in a way, Jane Eyre in the Caribbean.  Besides a good movie, we also see Lewton's rather progressive thinking as he treats both minorities and alternate religions (in this case, voodoo) with a fairness that is not typical for the era.  The Leopard Man deals with a serial killer in a small New Mexico town.  Finally, in this group are two movies that are related to the Tourneur-directed movies without actually being directed by him:  Curse of the Cat People (a sequel that is utterly different from the original while still being good) and The Seventh Victim (nominally a prequel to Cat People because it features Tom Conway playing the same character in both, the suave and amoral psychologist, Louis Judd).

The Karloff group features three movies starring Boris Karloff.  Tops among these is The Body Snatcher in which Karloff plays a murderous grave robber.  This is perhaps Karloff's best performance ever as he steals every scene he's in with his amiable form of evil.  This movie was also the last pairing of Karloff with Bela Lugosi.  Karloff also excels in Bedlam, a story of madhouses in 17th century England.  Finally, there is Isle of the Dead, which deals with a small Greek island infested with plague.

Ghost Ship, which stands alone (and is the weakest in the set) is a bit of a precursor to The Caine Mutiny, as it deals with a psychotically paranoid captain of a merchant ship.  Lawsuits kept this movie out of circulation until the 1990s.

Normally, when you watch a movie, you think of the contributions of the actors, the writers or the directors.  The producer is rarely considered, but Lewton is an exception, the rare producer who has a distinct artistic style.  This is because of Lewton's involvement with the movie-making process, especially the writing (he usually was an uncredited screenwriter on his films).  We can see the ""Lewton touch"" in his films, most notably with ""the walk"": a scene somewhere in his films where a character must take a perilous excursion into the dark.  There is also, the ""bus"" - a scene of sudden surprise (for the reason behind the name, see Cat People); it appears in most of his movies and is now done to death in suspense movies.

Cat People, I Walked With A Zombie, the Body Snatcher and Bedlam are all five star material; Ghost Ship merits three and the rest get four.  With commentaries on most films (all but Ghost Ship and Isle of the Dead) and a nice documentary about Lewton (which shows just how influential he was), this boxed set easily rates five stars.  If you appreciate old-style horror (or for that matter, just good, old-fashioned movies), this is well-worth watching.",1134691200,7,3842,4.827217125382263

Unfortunately, the quality of the releases is very disappointing. Speckled and damaged prints, unsteady images, dodgy compression, even poor sound on some of the titles. I agree with another reviewer of this set, Warner Brothers usually take great care over their releases, and this isn't up to their standard. Even the cardboard box is lousy!

330049,5,6301327977,"I saw some of these gems when I was a child and one in particular haunted me for days...and nights! ""The Leopard Man"" has several scenes which can only be categrized as ""hair-raising"" and one of the scarier scenes is the one which involves a young girl who is sent to the store to buy corn meal for her father's breakfast, after dark. This little errand turns into a horrific walk in the dark, through ravines and down dark streets and has a dreadful denouement.
The second is one where a young girl goes to a gated, walled cemetery to meet her lover and he never shows up and she is caught there alone after dark, when it is locked and she cannot get out. This one really scared me witless.
""The Curse of the Cat People"" was also scary, but is actually more of a thoughtful, gentle journey into a child's world peopled with an emotionally distant, unimaginative father and a wonderful, fanciful playmate in the form of Simone Simone. Every child should have a SS in their lives; what a wonderful presence she was.
""The Body Snatcher"" is about Burke and Hare, the 2 Scots who supplied doctors and medical colleges with cadavers by murdering the future ""cadavers."" These atrocities were so famous at the time they became known as ""Burking.""
""Cat People"" has many scary scenes and Lewton was a master of mood and atmosphere...This features Simone Simone again and is actually a prequel to ""Curse of the Cat People."" although there is scant resemblance between the two films.
""The Seventh Victim"" is very unusual, nothing else even remotely like it and what a great movie it is.
""I Walked with a Zombie"" is different Lugosi fare and really a wonderful addition to the collection. No matter how fantastic or implausible a premise seems, Lugosi always...(sorry)sank his teeth into it!
He really was magnificent though, and one of my all time favorites ever, is ""White Zombie"", a must-see for all horror fans.
All in all, a more than satisfying collection of original and unusual films...each one worthy of the price.",1132531200,4,2011,4.69971671388102
330050,5,6301327977,"At RKO between 1942 and 1945, an elegant producer named Val Lewton helped very talented actors, writers, and three directors make nine of the greatest horror films in movie history.  Behind such lurid titles as THE SEVENTH VICTIM, I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, CAT PEOPLE, and THE LEOPARD MAN lie fatalistic and pessimistic portraits of life, subtle psychological thrillers, very scary tales of the supernatural, and horror films with the emphasis on implying violence.

Val Lewton's nine great films are finally grouped together on one magnificent boxed set from Warner Home Video called THE VAL LEWTON HORROR COLLECTION.  The movies average 70 minutes and are grouped two to a disk as convenient evening-length double features.  The fifth disk has THE SEVENTH VICTIM sharing space with an original hour-long documentary called SHADOWS IN THE DARK: THE VAL LEWTON LEGACY. Start with it as an introduction.  Each disk has elegantly lurid poster art for the two movies on that disk.

CAT PEOPLE, I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, and LEOPARD MAN were all directed by Jacques Tourneur.  They are gems of the supernatural, masterpieces done on an impossibly low budget with gorgeous sets and photography to hide the budget.  CAT PEOPLE stars French actress Simone Simon as a woman descended from a race of cat people.  She marries architect Kent Smith with the warning that he must never kiss her or the curse will continue with him.  Tom Conway introduces the role of psychiatrist Louis Judd here that he will play in other Lewton tales.  And Jane Randolph will also appear in many Lewton films.  CAT PEOPLE is renowned for ""the bus scene"" and ""the swimming pool scene"", masterpieces of terrifying horror with nothing actually shown.

I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE has been called Val Lewton's version of JANE EYRE, but fans of Charlotte Bronte will probably be disappointed.  Lewton's movie is about zombies, normal people, and devil worship on a Haitian sugar plantation.  Like all Lewtons it has a stunning use of soundtrack (or lack thereof), magnificent photography, and the suggestion of violence.  This also applies to THE LEOPARD MAN, which is actually an adaptation of Cornell Woolrich's brilliant BLACK ALIBI novel.  There is a leopard loose and several killings that take place in a carnival time New Mexico desert town.  Dennis O'Keefe and Margo star here.  Based on these three ""B"" suspense movies, Jacques Tourneur is definitely a director to be reckoned with.  I am not that familiar with him.

No less than four of the nine Val Lewton productions were directed by Mark Robson, who started out as a film editor for Lewton and later directed masterpieces like my favorite PEYTON PLACE (1957).  The four Lewtons/Robsons are THE SEVENTH VICTIM, ISLE OF THE DEAD, THE GHOST SHIP, and BEDLAM.  THE SEVENTH VICTIM is Lewton's crowning achievement for me, a chilling and powerful and brilliantly made ""B"" programmer about devil worship and a missing sister in Greenwich Village.  Kim Hunter made her film debut here, and LEAVE IT TO BEAVER's Hugh Beaumont has a key supporting role as a lawyer.  The ending is unforgettable.  THE GHOST SHIP was out of circulation for sixty years (!) because of copyright problems.  It is a powerful would-be adaptation of Jack London's THE SEA WOLF.  In the role of his career, Richard Dix plays an authority-crazed sea captain who lets a man be killed.  When first mate Russell Wade reports the crime, he finds the rest of the crew siding with Dix until, one by one, they realize Wade is telling the truth.  The only flaw here is a curiously abrupt ending.

ISLE OF THE DEAD and BEDLAM both star Boris Karloff at his best, given a literate script for a change.  In ISLE, a group of people (including a possible vampire) are held hostage on an eerie Greek island during a war in 1912.  Karloff plays a Greek general.  The art direction is notable here, as it is with BEDLAM, which is the nickname for St. Mary's of Bethlehem Asylum in 1761 London.  Karloff runs the place with vengeance.  These are four of director Mark Robson's best films ever.

Also starting as an editor at RKO (on CITIZEN KANE and THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS!), Robert Wise directed THE BODY SNATCHER and co-directed (with Gunther V. Fritsch) THE CAT PEOPLE for Lewton.  Both films are ""B"" programmer masterpieces for me, Lewton at his best.  THE BODY SNATCHER teams Karloff as a grave robber, Bela  Lugosi as his scared but loyal assistant, and Henry Daniell as the doctor who needs the bodies for scientific research in 1840's Edinburgh.  This is a terrifying adaptation of a Robert Louis Stevenson novella.  And CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE has a young child conjuring up the ghost of her dead mother in a secret garden and making friends with an old woman in a haunted house.  Once again, the production design and photography and fine performances help hide the minimal budget.

If I had to pick a favorite Val Lewton movie, I'd pick THE SEVENTH VICTIM, but THE BODY SNATCHER and CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE would be right behind.  These are such elegant and intelligently written and beautifully made tales of horror and the supernatural.  They are guaranteed to give you sleepless nights.  Buy THE VAL LEWTON HORROR COLLECTION from Amazon.com, if you can afford it and admire the horror genre, for Christmas.  It retails for $60, but Amazon has it for $42.  That is more than reasonable for nine movies plus a documentary.",1132272000,8,5407,4.863238512035011

Contrast is still as problematic as with the Laser Discs, and those films that looked like they'd been mastered from hazy 16mm prints still give the same impression 10 years later. In other words: Warner has done absolutely NOTHING to improve the image quality of these masterpieces! This really puzzles me. Almost all their other classic films have been enormously improved on DVD. Just look at recent releases like the Film Noir box sets, the Gangster Movie box, the Controversial Classics box , the Fred & Ginger set, etc.

They all look fantastic compared to older releases on other formats. So why suddenly turn stingy with the Val Lewton films?

Let's hope this is not a new policy to save money, hoping that the majority of consumers expect no more from films this old.  Very disappointing!",1131494400,18,1353,4.668067226890757
330091,5,6301327977,"CAT PEOPLE- Simone Simon is Irena, a superstitious woman who is either crazy or can actually turn into a deadly panther upon consumating her marriage to Oliver Reed (Kent Smith)! A great study of superstition, fear, guilt, and sexual frustration. Jaques Tourneur makes full use of the shadows and untold horrors in our own minds! Tom Conway plays Irena's shrink. CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE- Irena (Simone Simon) returns in spirit form, befriending Oliver's daughter. This one is not so much a sequel as it is a ghost story as told by a child. I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE- Tom Conway (Cat People) is a man who's wife is either a zombie or mentally ill. Lots of eerie scenes and bleak atmosphere. Another Tourneur masterpiece! My favorite! THE BODY SNATCHER- Boris Karloff is Mr. Grey, a graverobber and murderer who keeps a local doctor (Henry ""Four Skulls Of Jonathon Drake"" Daniell) supplied with cadavers. Boris manages to be both sinister and human at the same time. Bela Lugosi plays a servant who attempts to blackmail Grey, not realizing just how evil Grey actually is. He certainly finds out! ISLE OF THE DEAD- Boris returns as a greek army general in 1912. He leaves the battlefield to visit a nearby island, only to be stranded there when plague strikes! We watch as his mind slowly unravels while succumbing to an enemy he cannot see nor fight. This movie has a wonderful subtext of modern science vs. ancient superstition and dread. Also, a cool treatment of a woman's fear of being buried alive. Her worst nightmare comes true! BEDLAM- Karloff's final Lewton film finds him playing the completely sadistic Master Simm, the head of an insane asylum in the 1700s. Simm has NO redeeming qualities whatsoever! Karloff makes him as interesting as he is reprehensible! Watch as he tries his best to destroy a woman who only wants to improve the conditions of the asylum's tortured souls. Don't worry, vengeance is waiting to spring forth! THE LEOPARD MAN- is the story of a sociopathic serial killer on the loose. Or is it? Tourneur returns with a darkly twisted tale that's far ahead of it's time. Years before PSYCHO, we are shown the depths of human depravity, turning a man into a stalking predator. Like Norman Bates, the unlikely monster is hidden by his aparent normalness and gentle facade. THE GHOST SHIP- Imagine being trapped on a ship with a crazy captain who wants to murder you! Of course, no one else on board believes you, so you're on your own! This is all about madness and the unwillingness of others to deal with it when the maniac happens to be someone in authority. THE 7th VICTIM- Devil worshippers decide that their newest member must die. Alas, she doesn't want to do herself in! A good look at how group pressure can drive you nuts. More noir-ish than occult-ish, Robson takes us on a tour of a strange and mysterious Greenwich Village. Tom Conway returns as Dr. Judd. This collection is an essential piece of horror history. I usually don't comment on extras, but SHADOWS IN THE DARK is a well made documentary on Val Lewton's career and the influences his movies have had on horror and movies in general.

330094,5,6301327977,"According to the documentary SHADOWS IN THE DARK, included in the collection, Val Lewton (1904-1951) was brought to RKO when that studio decided to compete with Universal in the horror genre.  As it happened, RKO was teetering on the verge of bankruptcy at the time--and Lewton was given audience-tested titles from which to develop inexpensive films.  Without the budget to create ""monster movies,"" Lewton responded with a series of nine films so artful, so imaginative that they have become legendary.

A number of Lewton's films, perhaps most obviously CAT PEOPLE and I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, deal with romantic relationships--but regardless of the plot detail Lewton inevitably presents his film as a seduction.  Both characters and audience are drawn deeper and deeper into the darkness of the tale.  Ultimately the darkness becomes literal; even at the height of film noir, few artists dared to make such intense contrasts of light and shadow or to use that contrast in such a startling way.

The films also have a poetic quality that is both undeniable and extremely difficult to define.  The direction, the acting, the dialogue--everything about a Lewton film is pure simplicity, but they have a fluidity of motion that is both remarkable and remarkably consistent.  The look of the films aside, the themes are certainly poetic in nature; with Lewton, death is both horror and release, something that may be postponed but cannot be escaped, a point to which we are inevitably drawn in spite of ourselves.

The box set consists of five DVDs each of which contain two titles: CAT PEOPLE and CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE; I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE and THE BODY SNATCHER; ISLE OF THE DEAD and BEDLAM; THE LEOPARD MAN and THE GHOST SHIP; and THE SEVENTH VICTIM and aforementioned SHADOWS IN THE DARK.  Although film quality is not pristine, it seems to represent the best possible short of a digital restoration--certainly this is easily the finest print of CAT PEOPLE I have ever encountered.  With the exception of two titles, all have notable audio commentary; original trailers round out the package.

Val Lewton was significantly under-appreciated during his lifetime and remains so to this day; even so, he is one of a handful of Hollywood directors and producers to whom the term ""genius"" can be applied.  This box set is long overdue.

330095,4,6301327977,"Nine B-movie wonders Val Lewton produced for RKO in the 1940s. Lewton's best-known works -- the stylish and sexy ""Cat People"" and the voodoo excursion ""I Walked With a Zombie"" -- staked out the psychological horror genre. Both were done with director Jacques Tourneur, who gave Lewton's works a sophisticated noirish look. The men ""were like Lennon and McCartney,"" horror director Guillermo del Toro says.

This DVD set, which includes a trio of Boris Karloff thrillers, has the same titles as Image's 1995 laserdisc box. All but two of the films have commentaries by Lewton enthusiasts, which are uniformly good.

All of these films show their age; they're damaged in varying degrees.

The docu ""Shadows in the Dark"" tracks the producer from his youth in Russia to his stint with David O. Selznick to his successful run at RKO. Del Toro, George Romero and Neil Gaiman are among the horror elite who pay tribute to Lewton.

RKO stole Lewton from Selznick, hungry for monster movies that could duplicate Universal's success. But, film historian Steve Haberman says, Lewton ""was thinking about what in reality frightens people: the dark, the unknown, madness, death.""

""Cat People"" (1942) startled audiences with its brazen marriage of sex and suspense. ""Twilight Zone"" director John Landis says he's still amazed at ""how sexually sophisticated it is."" ""Cat People"" tells of a dark-haired beauty whose belief in ""mad legends"" makes her refuse to sleep with her new husband, fearing she will morph into a predator cat. Marketed as ""stark shockery and killing chillery,"" the film gave Lewton a hit the first time out.

RKO ordered Lewton to use prefab titles, including the goofy ""I Walked With a Zombie"" (1943). Like ""Cat People,"" ""Zombie"" made good use of RKO sets left over from the Orson Welles era, showcasing them in silky black and white. Borrowing from ""Jane Eyre"" and ""Rebecca,"" Lewton and Tourneur delivered another 70-minute marvel, about a nurse who comes to the Caribbean to care for a woman who appears possessed by voodoo priests. Fast-talking British commentators Kim Newman and Steve Jones are spot on (""The dominant element of this film is Venetian blinds,"" one observes, deadpan).

Other gems include ""The Seventh Victim"" (directed by Mark Robson), ""The Leopard Man"" (Tourneur) and the night-and-fog Karloff starrer ""The Body Snatcher"" (Robert Wise).",1129680000,6,2365,5.143229166666667
330096,5,6301327977,"Just when you thought it was safe to go trick or treating ... This five disc, nine film collection captures the films the greatest grade B producer of all time. Lewton created some of the scariest and creepiest films of all times (the fear, the horror and the terror, are all firmly locked in the audience's imagination; to show them on screen would be superfluous). All are worth a look at. To whet your fright nights: Cat People and The Curse of the Cat People, staring the sublime and feline Simone Simon, are both truly frightening and disturbingly sexual.  And I Walked with a Zombie, a resetting of Jane Eyre in the West Indies, as well as Karloff in Isle of the Dead, Bleak at its best,",1129593600,5,693,4.456692913385827
330097,4,6301327977,"The release of 'The Val Lewton Horror Collection' (2005), which groups the producer's nine highly influential horror films of the 1940s under one umbrella, represents a watershed for movie fans the world over. The problem is that the films, several of which are both genre and non-genre classics, and all of which have been long unavailable, are of wildly varying quality.

The series began with the innovative and commercially successful 'Cat People' (1942), which is credited with bringing horror out of the wilds of Eastern Europe and locating it in the then-contemporary cityscape. Lewton's highest achievement, the haunting and evocative 'I Walked With A Zombie' (1942), one of the greatest fantastic films ever produced, and also made in conjunction with Jacque Tourneur, followed.

But after these two seminal works, which completely transcended their status as B-films, the series began deteriorating on an almost film-by-film basis, ending with the tedious historical romp of 'Bedlam' (1946), in which the infamous British mental asylum seems less threatening than an average off-hour New York City subway ride.

The movie-going public's neglect of the series probably also resulted from the disparity between the titles of three of the films and their actual content: the third film, 'The Leopard Man' (1943) obviously suggests the supernatural horror of 'Cat People' but revolves around an insane killer instead, while the title of 'The Ghost Ship' (1943) is purely metaphorical.

Perversely, 'The Curse of the Cat People' (1944), a sensitive fantasy about childhood, arguably features the spirits of the dead that 'The Ghost Ship' does not, but none of the feral monsters referred to in the title. Only the first two productions, 'Cat People' and 'I Walked With A Zombie,' feature unequivocally supernatural elements, suggesting that Lewton may have lost his nerve as he proceeded.

Clearly, Lewton was at his best and most innovative with Jacques Tourneur at the directorial helm, and when working with screenplays that brought horror into modern, and particularly urban, settings. When RKO forced Lewton to relinquish Tourneur, and cast Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, the major horror stars of the earlier decade in new productions, Lewton's work went into markedly noticeable decline.

The imagination, intelligence, depth, fluidity, subtly, and sense of wonder which enliven 'Cat People,' 'I Walked With A Zombie,' 'The Leopard Man,' 'The Seventh Victim' (1943), and 'Curse of the Cat People' were already fading by the time the enjoyable but lackluster 'Ghost Ship' went into production; the following project, 'Isle of the Dead' (1945) is sluggish and one-dimensional, 'The Body Snatcher' (1945), while an improvement, overly verbose and campy, and 'Bedlam' a perfect example of the kind of  'plywood historical waxwork' that both 'Cat People' and 'I Walked With A Zombie' had initially been reactions against.

It is no wonder that the later films were commercial failures upon release: today, they are interesting B-movie curios and opportunities to revel in or distain Karloff's performances. Like one of the vampiric 'vorvolakas' suspected of running rampant in 'Isle of the Dead,' Karloff's scene-stealing, exaggerated manner seems to drain entire casts, characters, and landscapes of color, energy, and interest.

Thankfully, Karloff wasn't recruited until the later, lesser films; his overbearing style would have played complete havoc with the perfectly balanced ensemble work of 'I Walked With A Zombie,' for which Frances Dee, Tom Conway, James Ellison, Edith Barrett, and Sir Lancelot are to be commended.

The extra features, other than the documentary, 'Shadows in the Dark: The Val Lewton Legacy,' are somewhat disappointing. Especially so is the entirely superfluous voiceover commentary by Kim Newman and Steve Jones for 'I Walked With A Zombie,' as neither seem to have more than cursory insight into the film or the meaning of the character portrayed by Darby Jones. Newman and Haberman, who sound like heckling frat boys, also pepper their conversation with fairly disparaging remarks about the principal actors.

'Exorcist' director William Friedkin's halting, nervous commentary on 'The Leopard Man' is also extraneous, especially since Friedkin fails to understand that the film's audience is supposed to imagine the killer, who has shot and skinned a black leopard, running amok after donning the skin and claws of the dead animal.

Thus, while the 'leopard man' is not a supernatural being, the film's title is not a ""misnomer"" as Friedkin states it is. One of the commentators in 'Shadows in the Dark' hilariously believes the title actually refers to minor character 'Johnny How-Come,' the original owner of the dead panther, who lives by exhibiting the animal and advertises himself as 'the leopard man,' as a banner on his vehicle reveals.

One of the pleasures of 'The Val Lewton Collection' are the actors, including Simone Simon, Tom Conway, Jean Brook, Jane Randolph, Sir Lancelot, and audience favorite Elizabeth Russell, some of whom were RKO contract players, probable favorites of Lewton and Tourneur, and thus appeared in several films apiece.

Kim Hunter makes her film debut as a young woman investigating a group of  Greenwich Village ""devil worshippers"" in 'The Seventh Victim,' which also features Hugh Beaumont, who went on to portray All-American father Ward Cleaver in the long-running 'Leave It To Beaver' series, as the male lead.",1129593600,7,5495,5.3955659276546095

Instead, you have lots of shadows (and don't most people fear the dark?), strange sounds, and universal fears. In the best of these, ""I Walked With A Zombie"", there's an exotic locale as well.

330147,5,6301327977,"Oh, Wow!  I just was doing a happy dance over Hammer's release of their films I have long wanted and now here is the ultimate Val Lewton Horror Collection.  Jacques Tourneur and Lewton created very special horror films.  They were thinking man's horror film.  Film in glorious black and white where shadows were long and dark (never achieved in colour films because of the bright lights needed), these films are moody, sinister, dark tales that whisper from the shadows instead of screaming boo!

""The Cat People"" is more familiar to most people.  This deals with a female who is a marmaluke (in Scotland we call them Greymalkins or Cait Sidhe), a female who can turn into a cat.  The sequel ""Curse of the Cat People"" was slightly oddball.  A sequel and yet some of it seems off.  In the first film, Kent Smith who plays Oliver Reed (joke there!!) falls for Simone Simon is Irena who is a marmaluke.  Later, as her nature reveals itself Smith turns to Jane Randolf (Alice), sending Simone in to a rage.  In Curse of the Cat People, Oliver and Jane have married and now have a daughter.  She is a little odd and lonely and suddenly starts seeing Irena's ghost.  Then an old lady and her daughter come into her life, both recognizing the child as a ""cat person"" EXCUSE ME? did something get left on the cutting room floor.  Irena died.  The child is Alice's so WHY is the child touched by the Cat People.  This is never explained well.  Still, it's a very moody film and is enjoyable.

One of my Fav films of all times is the silly titled ""I Walked With a Zombie"" This is Tourneur and Lewton adapting Bronte's tale into a modern day version of Jane Eyre!  It dark, moody and simply a classic.

The great Karloff turns up in another Lewton adaptation - this time Robert Louis Stevenson's The Body Snatcher"", though not directed by Tourneur but another director I really respect Robert Wise.  A young doctor needs a body for his medical experiment and Karloff is more than willing to get the - one way or another!

The Leopard Man was again the teaming of Lewton and Tourneur and shows horror can be set in many places.  This is in the desert resort town in Mexico.  For a publicity stunt, an agent gets his talented star to make an entrance with a leopard on a leash.  A jealousy rival scares the cat and it flees.  Later a girl is killed.  Then another.  But it's it the cat or something more sinister?

The Ghost Ship has the mysterious captain who may not have both oars in the water.  Not Lewton's best effort, but still very enjoyable.

Karloff is back in ""Isle of the Dead"" and ""Bedlam"".  In the first, Karloff plays Greek general traveling with others.  Soon the plague is following them so Karloff quarantines the house.  If that is not enough worries.  Karloff becomes convinced one girl is a vampire.  St. Mary's of Bethlehem Asylum in 1761 London is the setting for Bedlam.  Karloff gives a super performance as the head doctor who controls all.

The Seventh Victim is another great film that is often overlooked.  A devil cult is thriving in Greenwich Village.  Six people vowed to secrecy.  The six are now dead.  And now a new member the seventh of the group is missing.  A young Kim Hunter comes asearching for her sister the seventh missing member.

Gray, played by Boris Karloff in the film, has a very small part in the tale. He is killed by the student MacFarlane in the tale because he was tired of being insulted by Gray. It was straight out murder and not the result of a fight. In the film, he is the key man who brings bodies to the doctor, but not in the story.
There is a drama in the film about a young girl who is paralyzed. The doctor does not want to operate but Fetters and Gray persuade him to operate.

Mix two legendary horror film actors (Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff) under Robert Wise's direction, and get Lewton's help writing the screen play (under the pen name Carlos Keith), and you should know that you're in for a treat.

The film, based on Robert Lewis Stevenson's short story, involves brilliant if flawed Dr. Wolfe ""Toddy"" MacFarlane (Henry Daniell) who teaches anatomy in 1860s Edinburgh. A little girl Georgina Marsh (Sharyn Moffett) is brought to his house in a cab with her widowed mother (Rita Corday) after suffering injury in an accident that killed her father. Cabman John Gray (Boris Karloff), who also moonlights as a resurrection man, drives a white horse that captivates young Georgina's imagination. Within the doctor's household also resides Meg Camden (Edith Atwater) a constant stoic presence, and Joseph, (Bela Lugosi), Dr. MacFarlane's man Friday.

Dr. MacFarlane's newest student assistant Donald Fettes (Russell Wade) does his best to convince our good doctor to perform an operation that would allow the child to walk again. The only way to enjoin success is to study the anatomy of the spinal cord.

How this is done, and what happens afterward, is offered up as an intelligent morality play with equal nods to science and the sacredness of the human body.

Incredible sets, poignant lighting, and a script minus a completely satisfactory solution to a dilemma that plagued physicians and scientists for centuries, The Body Snatcher remains a classic for very good reason.",1499472000,2,1545,5.213709677419355

I will rehash this review because I own all of the classic monster movies such as Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolfman, The Invisible Man The streaming ones in HD are top quality. You see every detail including when the Monster throws the lil girl into the lake. I own these movies on DVD, Blu-Ray and now streaming which I enjoy more because I can setup my own monsterthon and do as lil work as possible setting it up.",1486944000,,498,4.544444444444444

7811672,5,6301327977,I have seen this movie many times and enjoy it always.  It has a pretty predictable story line. The story follows the life of a doctor turned educator after being accused of murder for hire to obtain bodies for dissection in a medical school.... A child is brought in with a spinal injury that the doctor treats surgically.  The child still cannot walk after the surgery...  The Cabman Gray brings a body to help research the child's condition....  Karlof gives a stunning performance as the cab man Gray who is both caring and sinister at the same time.  The ending is well worth watching the entire movie......,1476748800,,612,4.682242990654205
7811673,5,6301327977,"These are amazingly complex films by Val Lewton. Each one makes use of black and white film to the utmost. The plots are weighty; the acting is believable and professional. Sets are detailed, realistic. The quality of film transfer is next to flawless as is the sound track. Murder, mystery, occultism, World War II tensions, evil leaders--they are all there in one film or another. The perfect ""dessert"" or non-alcoholic chaser.",1471046400,2,429,5.056338028169014
