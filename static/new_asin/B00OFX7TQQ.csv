6735700,5,B00OFX7TQQ,"This is a great DVD to get ready for the upcoming Spongebob Squarepants movie or just because.  It features the first original SpongeBob Squarepants episode from back in 1999.  I don't think I ever saw that so that was pretty cool to watch.  The rest of the DVD, the mini movie and the over 40 shorts I saw on television but it was nice to have them all compiled together. It features probably all the best parts of the show in this one DVD.  Its perfect or old or new fans and lots of fun.

6735704,3,B00OFX7TQQ,"I bought this on a lark after not having seen much of the show beyond the ""First Hundred Episodes"" box.  Most valid criticisms can be found in other reviews, but one that bears repeating is that the vast majority of these ""Spongebob Minis"" just seem like random scenes from other episodes that cut off abruptly, interspersed with the truly maddening repetition of the Nickelodeon logo.  Stephen Hillenberg greatly reduced his direct involvement in writing and production after the first 100 episodes and the first Theatrical feature, and this disc clearly demonstrates that I haven't been missing much since.  Such a great show shouldn't be allowed to decline into mediocrity like this.",1429747200,,686,5.162162162162162
6735705,3,B00OFX7TQQ,"98 minutes? of what?
The main ""mini"" movie was about 50 minutes. the rest was 42 shorts. Each short had a 5 second nickelodeon jingle, 5 seconds of someone introducing a short and then the short. It works out to over 7 minutes of introduction. and the shorts (with the exception of one nearly 5 minute one) were all were REAL short. I think they were short excerpts from various Sponge Bob cartoons, and they were on average about 40-50 seconds long. Most of them ended abruptly often in MID SENTENCE! So 42 time one is constantly clicking the remote wearing out the batteries for the next one turning down the sound so you don't have to hear the jingle AGAIN, then turning the sound back up. The Mini Movie itself was Ok but it was about half patchy the pirate or guest stars...do we really buy Sponge Bob cartoons to see patchy? There were a few cameos by stars like Robin Williams, but it seems to me a Sponge Bob video, so short like this one should be mostly Sponge Bob...so it was a bit disappointing...not to mention I had that blasted nickelodeon jingle in my head for about three days afterwards.",1427068800,2,1105,4.448275862068965
6735706,3,B00OFX7TQQ,"Like the box says, it features a 'Mini Movie', so they've got you on a technicality no matter WHAT you expected. As for the 42 'shorts', they're not ANYTHING LIKE Pixar Shorts (Short productions with a definite beginning and ending). These are actually nothing but CLIPS FROM THE TV Show episodes, so you WILL notice where they were edited (cut off) just when something else was about to happen. If you have Hulu Plus and you've watched the 'Clips' from Movie/TV Show segments, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. It's not horrible, because children who're Spongebob fans will still enjoy watching this, and depending on the price, it may not be a bad deal. Just don't have high (Adult) expectations, because you probably WILL be let down. ",1426032000,3,748,4.84375
6735707,4,B00OFX7TQQ,I would love to see the never-before-seen episodes and anything I have never seen before on Spongebob!,1425945600,,102,5.0588235294117645
6735708,3,B00OFX7TQQ,"For $5 its not that it's a bad deal, but with individual seasons hovering around $11 or $12 now it's hard not to recommend springing for a whole season instead. In addition, the video quality on this compilation disc is HORRENDOUS, which is something I wish I had known at the time of purchase. It may seem a bit nit-picky to some, but I know there are others out there like myself who are driven nuts by terrible video compression. All in all, you could do worse for $5, but you also could do a bit better if you're willing to spend a little more.",1423094400,,548,4.228571428571429
6735709,4,B00OFX7TQQ,"There's a total of 42 ""SpongeBob mini""s in this DVD, alongside Help Wanted (and Reef Blower, the only silent SpongeBob episode ever made) and an edited letterbox-widescreen version of Truth or Square when compared to the uncut version in the season 6 sets and even the televised print! The 42 shorts mostly came from the specials and mini-series of seasons 4 to 8, many of them stupidly and abruptly end in mid-sentence for reasons unknown. But believe it or not, there's a total of 12 shorts never before on DVD until here; 3 coming from Atlantis SquarePantis, 4 from Pest of the West, and 4 from WhoBob WhatPants, and a rare Halloween short called The Creature Frumunda The Sink! All of those dozen shorts aren't on any other DVD, not even the season 5 sets, unedited or otherwise. You might wanna go ahead and get this DVD for the sake of this all-in-one collection of SpongeBob shorts, even with some endings cut short, but it doesn't contain any fan-made shorts that're also called Square Shorts. Sadder still, this disc doesn't contain The Endless Summer short, where thanks to Mr. Krabs' advice, SpongeBob wants it to be an endless summer by making huge contributions to global warming; nor does it contain any of the water PSA shorts for Nick's Big Green Help! Someone needs to contact Nick about such editing and restore the shorts that're abruptly ended on this DVD, and replace them with discs of all uncut shorts. If only Nick bothered to include the dozen new-to-DVD shorts in the seasons 5 and 7 sets! Many of us hope there'll be new SpongeBob episodes in 2015, not just Sponge Out of Water for the big screen, and not just 1-and-a-half new episodes for the whole year like 2014! Crazy, isn't it?",1421798400,7,1710,4.6843853820598005
6735710,2,B00OFX7TQQ,The pilot and mini movie both appear on other discs and collections. The shorts seem to be alternate scenes to existing episodes. Many stop in mid-sentence. Disappointing.,1420675200,7,171,5.37037037037037

8683392,1,B00OFX7TQQ,"The pilot episode presented here is just plain dumb, making it hard to believe that many of the series' other early episodes actually DIDN'T suck!  The DVD goes straight downhill from there with a mini-movie including live-action segments where super-annoying Patchy the Pirate tries to round up celebrities (Rosario Dawson, LeBron James, Tina Fey, Will Ferrell, Craig Ferguson, and Robin Williams have cameos; singer Pink performs a song) to appear on his SpongeBob special.  After that, the disc presents 42 animated shorts (most under a minute long) which take un-funny to new levels.  Please don't waste your money on this junk.
