8060009,5,B0009FBFEG,She-Ra comes to life again for a new generation of fans as well as the previous ones on this DVD collection!,1260230400,,108,4.190476190476191
8060010,4,B0009FBFEG,I bought this DVD about a year and a half ago and it's definitely not even comparable to the Best of She-ra DVD or anything else that BCI released under the She-ra: POP franchise but the cover art is truly great. I sure hope there's a poster with that same cover art. It looks very official. :-D,1181433600,2,295,4.192982456140351
8060011,1,B0009FBFEG,"Don't waste your money. With the full OFFICIAL collection coming out within only a few months (and the Secret of the Sword + 5 best eps of She-Ra available NOW) why spend money on bootlegs?

I'm surprised this is even still listed on Amazon.",1153180800,3,241,4.4772727272727275
8060012,4,B0009FBFEG,A great series of episode on this dvd. The only problem with the Amazon on line listing is that being marked IMPORT they don't list if it Region 1 or another Region dvd that might not play on Region 1  DVD players.,1134172800,6,214,4.095238095238095
8060013,5,B0009FBFEG,"It's nice to see the return of one of my childhood favorites to dvd!  This had to be one of my all-time favorite cartoons when I was growing up, along with Jem.  The dvd has six episodes that  definitely brought back memories to this 80s gal.  I definitely recommend this dvd and am hoping for more future releases that will have interviews with the creators of the show.",1117152000,5,371,4.411764705882353
8060014,5,B0009FBFEG,"I just picked up this dvd and was amazed to see my childhood favorite in dvd quality. To put it simly, I absolutely love it! For those of us who grew up watching and pretending to be Adora (She Ra's real name), this DVD instantly takes you back. The morals at the end with the hiding character are truly classic... I whole-heartedly recommend this! So where is the next volume? :P",1116720000,17,380,4.366197183098592
