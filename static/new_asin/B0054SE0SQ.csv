8457026,3,B0054SE0SQ,"While I enjoyed this documentary, I felt we needed more - either another documentary about a different trip, or more on Ukraine itself. Everything moved so fast in the beginning that I kept thinking I'd missed something; only towards the end did she really spend time showing us a particular place. I would have liked a more in-depth look at Ukraine, or at another country if this is part of a larger series.",1379721600,,408,4.602739726027397
8457027,4,B0054SE0SQ,"excellent footage on Chernobyl; some other parts of film were not relevant to general depiction of the Ukraine.
Otherwise a good film",1358899200,,133,5.090909090909091
8457028,4,B0054SE0SQ,"This episode of globetrekker visits one of the largest and least known countries in Europe. Holly does a fantastic job exploring various areas and cultures within Ukraine, interacts with locals, and tries the cuisine. I enjoyed her time in Lviv the most. My only complaint is that they hardly spent any time in Kiev (Ukraines largest and most famous city) instead focussing on Chernobyl too long.",1338768000,2,396,5.015151515151516
