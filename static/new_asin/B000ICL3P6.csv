8144953,1,B000ICL3P6,"I have this opera as part of the M22 collection. I understand this was an unfinished opera.  This production attempts to juxtapose transitional Mozart interspersed with modern dissonant 12 tone.  This is complemented on stage with 2 sets of actors/singers performing what appears to be parallel roles.  The modern music is ugly, irritating, and sounds as if a 78 is being played at 33rpm.  Much sounds as beautiful as nails on a chalkboard.  The modern additions to the libretto are abstract words/phrases sung in stutters accompanied by strange movements on stage. There is no meaningful integration much less honor and completion to the work.  The plot and action becomes incomprehensible and the modern interludes are simply weird and non sequitur.  Whaling and shouting, making strange noises and movements and calling it art?  Give me a break.

Alfred Schnittke (Pianissimo (1968)) succeeded in taking a Mozart piano piece and framing it in 12 tone creating a sonic-spacial masterpiece that evoked visual images of the piano in a frame surrounded by Schiinittke's music which caressed it.  That was a very successful work that had a clear meaning and context while honoring Mozart and preserving Mozart's expression within the ""frame.""

This present work is drivel,         ",1437436800,2,1279,5.237623762376238
8144954,5,B000ICL3P6,"Mozart's unfinished Zaide is considered a slightly older, less memorable brother to the composer's Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail [The Abduction from the Seraglio.].  Zaide is a rescue opera, with a plot based on Voltaire's ""Zaire.""  The exiled Christian Gomatz is visited by the Muslim harem slave Zaide, the sultan's favorite concubine.  Zaide falls in love with the enslaved Gomatz, rescues him, and together they flee with the aid of the overseer, Allazim.  Zaide chooses spirited freedom over financial security, and invokes the Sultan's wrath.  Zaide and Gomatz are recaptured, imprisoned, and sentenced to death.  Awaiting execution in the dungeon, Zaide remains defiant, and the opera abruptly stops with an emotional quartet in which the principals express their anxieties, hopes, and fears.  Entfuhrung/Seraglio ended on an optimistic note.  Had it been completed, it is doubtful Zaide would have followed suit; Voltaire's original play ended tragically.  Zaide ends with the Sutlan's decision to kill Zaide and Gomatz.  The unhappy ending may have been the reason for Mozart's eventual abandonment of the project.

For his Salzburg production, Claus Guth's intertwines Mozart's neglected, unfinished work with Adama (Earth in Hebrew), by 21st century Israeli composer Chaya Czernowin, commissioned especially for this project.  During Mozart's brief lifetime, he worked with traditional forms and then, especially later in his career, defied those forms.  It is one of the great tragedies of music that Mozart did not live another ten to twenty years.  His late works (such as the Symphony in G minor ) saw Mozart at his most expansive and innovative.  To achieve a true Mozartean spirit, contemporary directors, when interpreting Mozart, should first and foremost forget that this is the work of ""THE"" Mozart.

Claus Guth's Zaide is a profoundly imaginative interpretation that conveys the Mozartean essence in ways that are surprising, provocative, and unforgettable.  Guth's staging of Zaide is one of relentless communication. Guth and Czernowin starkly tap the fleshy context of Zaide.  Czernowin's doomed Romeo and Juliet/Israeli-Palestinian couple in modern day Israel parallel Zaide and Gometz.  The contemporary couple, simply named Woman and Man, also contrast Zaide, Gometz, and each other. Woman and Man do not communicate in the normal sense, but through consonants, grunts, and expressions. Yet, through their confused tongues, the two couples represent sharing amidst nightmarish repression.

Contrasting the two sets of couples are a tribe of men representing the status quo, adorned in business suits and over-sized, banal, masked heads. This tribe, who constitute the hordes of the Sultan and the lords of the institutional dungeon, also struggle, immensely, in their attempts at communication, absurdly removing their masks then absurdly placing them back on their heads.  Despite their difficulties Zaide, Gometz, Man, and Woman, succeed in communicating. However, the Sultan and his tribe only  stumble in their attempts to communicate. Despite their power (and, of course, because of their power) the Sultan and his thugs are impotent. In frustration and desperation they predictably reach for their only recourse: the stones for the stoning.

The sets, designed by Guth's frequent collaborator, Christian Schmidt, are cast in a crystallized, barren viridian hue. The sets also emphasize contrasts: a normal size school desk is juxtaposed against a giant school desk, and a 4th dimension made up of projected video images enhance the tortured milieu.  Mozart's music rises from the pit (Ivor Bolton conducting The Salzburg Mozarteum Orchestra) while Czernowin's contrasting atonal music is played on the stage (by Johannes Kalitzke conducting the Austrian Ensemble for New Music).  Both conductors and ensembles are inspired, rising to what had to be a considerable challenge.

Soprano coloratura Mojca Erdmann is captivating as a down to earth, bitingly angelic Zaide.  Topi Lehtipuu's Gomatz is beguiling, tragically sensitive and yearning.  John Mark Ainsley's Sultan, bloodied and stern, commands nothing less than complete attention as a great wall of rigidity, which Johan Reuter's Allazim is unable to penetrate. Andreas Fischer repels as The Father (or rather, the symbolic Fatherland) who separates Woman and Man.  Noa Frenkel is simply amazing as Woman.  She expresses Czernowin's jarring musical language with ease and perfectly compliments Yaron Windmueller's equally compelling Man.  Their duets together linger vividly in the memory long after the finale, which left this viewer incoherently mumbling to himself as the applause and boos of the evening faded through the speakers.

8144955,1,B000ICL3P6,"I'm assuming that you will have read the two existing reviews which clearly establish the bizarre contents of this production. I imagine the only ones who will find viewing it a fruitful experience, aside from stockholders in the disc makers firm, are those who, being familiar with neither composer's work, will have no expectations as to what will be seen and heard in this DVD. To ruin the beautiful music of Mozart by interrupting its flow with the harsh contradictory sounds of Czernowin is aesthetically illogical, to mar the impact of the ""new"" music by setting up sharply contrasting melodies of a Master among Masters, is to undermine its authenticity.
All in all, I would recommend passing on purchasing this one save if you are thinking of buying the full Mozart 22 set and feel that the price of others in the set outweigh the defects of this one.
Oh, yes, I am sure there are some for whom this will represent an adventurous conceptualization of how to handle a short piece (Zaide). Perhaps they will find the outcome gratifying; others, beware!",1222128000,8,1058,4.818681318681318
8144956,2,B000ICL3P6,"I seldom react so strongly to a production that I am unable to get it off my mind.  It will be a long time, if ever, before I will be able to even hear Zaide without being influenced by this staging.

The set is very simple, containing two school desks.  One is a normal size desk but the other is at least twice as high and wide, putting the seat at head level.  Some of the cast put large hollow plastic heads over their heads.  These fake heads are scaled up by the same scale factor as the large desk.  As the singers move from the normal desk to the scaled up desk, they appear to shrink, becoming ghoulish and sinister looking.  In the live performance, the illusion would have been tempered by the fact that both desks would be in view at the same time.  The live audience was not deprived of binocular vision, hence the effect was not as disturbing.  On a TV screen, the effect was so overwhelming that the music actually became quite secondary for me.

If you enjoyed the Salzburg Fledermaus staged by Neuenfels, you will probably enjoy this too.  At least Fledermaus has been released many times on DVD.  In fact it has been overdone in my opinion, thus it is ""fair game"" for a ""roasting"".  Zaide is not given frequently, maybe it deserves a better production.

If the purpose of this was to divide the audience, then it is a success.  Tentative applause and several boos from the audience gave me a sense of relief, as I realized that I was not alone in being ""grossed out"".

But wait, there is more!  Czernowin wrote connecting music to tie together the bits and pieces that is Zaide.  Her music is atonal and very abrasive.  This is yet another attempt to mash music together that at least gets ones attention, rather than bore us to death (Irrfahrten II).

Czernowin strikes me as being a disciple of a little known opera composer by the name of Boris Blacher, who wrote an abstract opera.  All I recall of this work was a repeated line, something like ""Ah-ooh-ah-ooh-gatta-gatta-gatta-ah-ooh.""  This was a double bill with Blacher's ""The Tide"" which actually was quite good.  Both operas seem to have had a very short time in the sun.  I may be wrong, but Adama (connecting music) will fade away as well.  This ""filter of time"" is what gives many the sense that older composers were better, which is not always true.

This is a well sung production, so I give it an extra star for the singers.",1185062400,14,2408,4.465596330275229
8144957,5,B000ICL3P6,"To present these fragments from an unfinished Mozart opera, ""Zaide"", the Salzburg festival could have opted for an easy way out: mix it with Thamos, another unfinished ""stage music drama"" and let the traditionalists be happy...Not so here.

The management decided to commission a brand new work by the Israeli composer Chaya Czernowin, and let her musical language, very dense, very rough and very modern -as far away from Mozart as one can possibly imagine, mix with the arias and ensembles of Zaide. Contrary to what many may think, I believe that there is no better homage to the composer's 250th anniversary than linking him with XXIst-century music...and problems. Indeed, Czernowin's music takes us in Israel, and hints at the impossible love between an Israeli woman and a Palestinian man. I think the beautiful aspect of intermingling Zaide and ""Adama"" (the title of Czernowin's piece, meaning ""Earth"" in Hebrew) lies in the attempt at showing communication problems not so much between communities but also between people. The man and the woman of Czernowin's piece never really talk to each other: they communicate through syllables, sounds or concepts (""earth"", ""blood"", ""mother"", ""in vain"") - the latter much worse since the words are interpreted differently by the different communities at stake and this leads to further suffering and further misunderstanding.

Musically I have been impressed by the Israeli's composer sharp and obsessive language, with very little affect but demonstrably striking passages, such as the duet between the man and the woman at the end of Act I or the unbearable torture scene in Act II. After the intermission, ""Adama""'s music becomes even denser, with even less space to breathe, less harmony, less consistency, and more arid sounds. As we went along, I felt less and less comfortable...until this purely magic moment where Zaide, for the first time, sang in Czernowin's composition, linking these two worlds for a couple of bars. It hadn't happened before (except for ""Adama"" slightly overlapping an introduction or a coda of Mozart's piece)...and it won't happen again.

To capture on stage these worlds of repression (keep in mind that Mozart's characters are also in prison and trying to escape), Claus Guth designed a fantastic production. Guth had delivered a very unique, schizoid Fliegende Hollander at Bayreuth back in 2003. Tragedy is his domain and his portrayal of Zaide/Adama is one of nightmare and desperation in front of adversity.

Musically, everything was perfect. Mojca Erdmann was a beautiful soprano coloratura, John Mark Ainsley (straight from Giardiniera in the same collection) a vocally-strong Soliman, Topi Lehtipuu was very lyrical and so were the two bassi, Renato Girolami and Johan Reuter.

In Adama, Noa Frenkel was incredible, juggling with Czernowin's difficult music as if she had done it all her life. Her lover Yaron Windmueller was also very good: their moments/duets together were among the strongest aspects of the performance. Even Ivor Bolton seemed inspired. Also kudos to Johannes Kalitzke and his Oesterreichisches Ensemble fur Neue Musik"", in charge of ""Adama"", for their very accurate and stimulating work on Czernowin's performance.

The DVD captures the evening very well, down to the ""bravis"" and the ""boos"" that accompanied the curtain calls of this incredible stage performance. Congratulations to everyone involved. This is one of the strongest offerings of the ""M22"" collection.",1169078400,20,3480,5.3296903460837886
