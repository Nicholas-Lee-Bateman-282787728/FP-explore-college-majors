1856770,1,B00008OOTA,"I bought this documentary with the high hopes of seeing a well done, fact based story about some of the untold stories of The Gulf War. Instead I got a sappy bias story that seemed more like a old throw back of the anti-Vietnam documentaries that overflowed the gear for a decade. I know that there was so much good press of the gulf war that there was bound to be one of these anti-war films but this one is so sour and anti-almost everything that it just sounds bitter. Look I'm not saying it can't be interesting at times, there is the part about Gulf war syndrome that is not only interesting but true, but other than that everything else is just "" What other baloney can we say to make a successful campaign look bad"".They even try to give reasons that Saudi Arabia was never in danger of being attacked by Iraq after Iraq invaded Kuwait. I found this extremely hilarious considering that after the war started not only did Iraq fire SCUD missiles into Saudi Arabian cities but that Iraqi forces crossed the border into Saudi Arabia and attacked coalition forces that were protecting the country. Take my advice and spend your money on a documentary that puts the facts before there personal agenda.",1055203200,16,1204,4.552995391705069

7986182,1,B00008OOTA,"I served in the Gulf with the Marines in Desert Shield/Desert Storm.  This is nothing more than a slanted video with an axe to grind.  Not at all worth the time. Nothing about the tactics and strategies.  All about the Imperialistic United States.  Iraq and Sadaam Hussein were apparently the victims.  If you don't thing Ramsey Clark is an idiot than this video is for you.
Would give zero stars if possible.  Minimum is one star.",1367884800,2,431,4.605263157894737
7986183,5,B00008OOTA,"This was a revealing and in depth look at the damages the U.S. caused through the direct war and indirect actions. With millions of children dieing in Iraq for no reason it surely clears up why they (Arab, Muslim or anyone simply not American) hate us so much.",1360368000,,260,4.4375
7986184,5,B00008OOTA,"For history buffs, those interested in politics or simply the curious, this documentary will fascinate viewers alike with its jaw dropping footage of damages inflicted on Iraq and to its innocent civilians during Desert Storm and provides the determing factors that lead up to it. Included is a shocking explanation on the cause of Gulf War Syndrome which afflicted many of the soldiers who fought and who had been left in the dark as to the dangerous content of the weapons they were fighting with. I highly recommend you view this documentary! It is a must.",1140652800,2,559,4.833333333333333
7986185,4,B00008OOTA,"I was quite pleased with the content of this film.  Generally it is factually accurate as far as I can tell (and I've read enough on the subject to make me think I can make that judgement).  The biggest drawback is the price.  To buy this film new is a pretty big purchase, even for someone who studies Iraq extensively.

The film spends time initially going over basic history of the region, which was generally accurate (although I felt they overstated Washington's relationship with the Shah of Iran...i.e. the oil crisis.  That couldn't have happened without Iran, would/could a puppet of the U.S. take steps that hurt the U.S. as much as the oil crisis did?  I doubt it.)  Moving on...

This film covers many important aspects of what was happening in Iraq during the 90's but it does not go in-depth enough in my opinion.  Perhaps the film could have been extended another 30 to 60 minutes in order to dig a bit deeper.  Overall this is a good film, but you need to do some reading in addition to watching the film to get a complete picture of Iraq in the 90's.

My only problem with the film now (and the filmakers can't be faulted for this since it happened after the film was made) is the inclusion of Ramsey Clark.  He's an anti-war activist that worked in the LBJ administration.  There's nothing wrong with that on the surface, but he's taken his criticism of the U.S. and its actions to a new extreme as he is now an advisor to Saddam Hussein's legal team.  That crosses the line...big time.  But again, not the filmakers fault.",1130198400,2,1541,4.4928057553956835
7986186,4,B00008OOTA,"A MUST SEE FILM - BUT I WANT TO SAY THIS ABOUT A FORMER REVIEWER:

THE FOLLOWING IS A REVIEW THAT MADE ME CRINGE IN DISBELIEF... Pass the Kool-Aid and the ammunition -- BEGIN THE FORMER REVIEW HERE:

Misleading and Sophomoric (sic)--NO STARS, July 2, 2003

Reviewer: A viewer

Mostly for college kids...Yes, it is. Should work well for inspiring new bumpersticker (also sic) designs and t-shirt slogans.

Now, although I am not the Amazing Kreskin, the reviewer wouldn't leave his name but he does leave a heck of a URL trail.

I did some research on the NO NAME person - Turns out he is Jason P. Williams of Sacramento CA.

He hated this film but he also hated anything by Michael Moore and anything slightly anti the current administration ... He does however think that anything performed by Madonna is a FIVE Star ""film.""  Love Angel by Gwen Stephani gets a 5 STAR rating too.  You will be surprised to note that Jason loved the poorly received movie STEALTH, Hated the Last Samurai (Which i didn't see so I haven't got a clue here.) He reviews it at least 4 times... Why?  I don't know.  Hated Bowling for Columbine but loved T-3 Rise of The Machines.  Loved CNN's fantasy film ""The War In Iraq - Road To Baghdad""  The list of A+ FIVE STAR rated films and games, is, to quote jason ""SOPHOMORIC"" Just spelled different... Don't believe me... Hell, I wouldn't believe anything here after reading Jason's ""list.""  Just go to his reviews and make some sort of sense out of it... I would bet money that Jason does not own nor has he seen any film by Michael Moore or the film here, ""Hidden Wars of Desert Storm""  He insists that since it is a film distributed by an Arab company it has no merit.  HA!

My personal thoughts on the film after actually watching it are:

Watch this film if you want to know how deeply entrenched the USA and Western Europe is with Middle Eastern Oil concerns - Mainly the House of Saud -- Ya' know, those guys who Bush blithely walks around in Texas, holding hands with and then after 9/11 flies them all out of the country without a single question...  Those are the ones.

Watch this film if you want to know what the effects of depleted uranium are on people who ingest it... It is pretty darned ugly but heck, there's oil there and we want it.

Watch this film if you think that we are being led down the primrose path by a bunch of knuckle-draggers who are in bed with:

Religious fundamentalists, money grubbing oil executives, narcissistic idiots AKA the CIA who placed evil overlords in power in the Middle East so we can profit for ever from raping the indigenous people of that region and would like to see that you may be onto something.

Yes, the film drags in places and there could have been a bit edited out just to get to the point a bit quicker.

BUT -- the excellent archival footage was interesting and well placed.

Do not watch this movie if you have a weak stomach.  Do not watch this film if you think that GW Bush is really talking to God or just plain want to remain in the confines of your own inner space.

In other words; Jason from Sacramento needs to actually watch or read some of the stuff he reviews with an open mind before going by what he interprets from the Drudge Report or the secret memo's he gets from Scott McClellan every morning.",1126742400,7,3303,4.398682042833608
7986187,5,B00008OOTA,"A little known fact it is that begins this vital documentary which should be seen by everyone:  many Iraqis actually welcomed the American invasion of their country in March 2002, not because it meant possible termination to the vicious reign of Saddam Hussein (although that too), but rather because an invasion would definitely have meant a shift in U.S. promulgated policy of sanctions which, from the end of Gulf War I, had been responsible for the death of over 600,000 Iraqi children.  These were the most brutal sanctions ever imposed on a civilian population in modern history and held in place for the longest duration, and, as the film makes abundantly clear in words and pictures, in the minds of the material witnesses, not directly employed by the United States government, amounted to an act of flagrant genocide.  Why?
The film examines U.S. involvement in Iraq from before World War II until the period leading up the second invasion.  The film was actually released in late 2000.  Shown in black and white and living color is the history of the West's involvement with Mid-East oil and how Iraq fits into that picture over and 80 year period; the long and serpent-winding love/hate relationship between the U.S. and Sadaam Hussein, who, in the words of one of the films commentators, still a key figure in U.S./Iraq relations, ""rode to power on a U.S. train""; the full history of Gulf War I, including Bush the Elder's mysterious policy which kept Saddam in power at the close of the war, when General Schwarzkopf, who provides commentary in the film, was sweeping toward total victory; details of the extensive use of depleted uranium warheads (uranium 238), better known as DU warheads, the deadly link between radioactive DU dust and ""Gulf War Syndrome"" and its impact on U.S. troops who served in Iraq, suppressed by the U.S. military; details of the aftermath of Gulf War I:  how genocidal sanctions imposed by the U.N. under pressure from the U.S. served to strengthen Sadaam and keep the Bath Party in power; how the illegal `no-fly' zones kept in place during the Clinton Administration terrorized the civilian population as they were butchered in random bombings over a decade long `truce';  how the Iraqi civilian population was denied basic medical supplies under the sanctions and the effects of this combined with nuclear radiation from DU munitions scattered throughout the country; and many other sorry, sordid details leading up to the current invasion  and occupation.
Still proud to be an American?  Please, I beg you, see this film.",1126396800,6,2568,4.981308411214953
7986188,5,B00008OOTA,"This excellent film should be seen by everyone -- particularly those looking for insight into why the U.S. has pursued the policy it has in the Middle East, and Iraq in particular. Consider this film to be anti-spin, helping to counter the various Bush administrations' myths and lies about Iraq and the motivations of our policy toward this country.
You will notice the only slightly veiled racism of some of the critical reviewers: ""The Distributor is worth noting"" says the reviewer from D.C. -- as if calling itself 'Arab Film Distribution' is something the distributor should be ashamed of. I mean, most normal people don't watch ""Schindler's List"" and say: ""Oh look, Stephen Spielberg is a Jew! Gosh! Can't trust this film!"" ... if you know what I mean.
Anyway, if the issue is supposed to be the film's objectivity, one should note instead that the filmmaker is from Switzerland, a neutral country. I would trust a Swiss journalist to report objectively about U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East a lot more than I would trust, say, Fox News (which provided targeting information to the U.S. military during the most recent Iraq war, totally destroying any credibility they may have had as objective journalists and seriously endangering their journalist colleagues), as that reviewer probably does.
In any case, great work, great film -- it's nice to know that this information is out there and readily available, any time you want to know part of actual history that you won't read in the official text.",1072742400,15,1514,4.9411764705882355
7986189,5,B00008OOTA,"You can't simply dismiss this DVD as yet another ""Conspiracy Theory"" video made by a wacko with a grudge.  The people interviewed here are iraqi dissidents, state department people, UN officials, policy analysts, and former government officials.
Its a thought provoking insight into what why the USA does what it does in the middle east.  I'll give you a hint...it starts with a Crude and ends with an Oil.
Whats so sad is seeing a US state department official obviously lying during one interview with a straight face.  Maybe he didn't realize it, maybe he was just following orders, who knows.
Neoconservative rightwingers will hate this video, as it bares the full truth of what Desert Storm was all about.
The most that can be hoped for is that we learn from our mistakes of the past, but if you take into consideration our 2003 war on Iraq, lessons were not learned.",1070409600,14,871,4.717105263157895
