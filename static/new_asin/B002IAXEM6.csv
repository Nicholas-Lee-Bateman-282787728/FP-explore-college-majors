8370778,3,B002IAXEM6,"This DVD was a disappointment.  I was hoping my son and I would learn more about the Premier League and see some beautiful plays executed.  We did get some of both of those things, but my overriding impression is of MTV-like frantic camera work.  Instead of clearly showing a good play from several angles, they actually make the action harder to follow by using film shot through the net, speeding up the film to make it seem more active, and, incredibly, shrinking the size of the screen when showing the ""Goal of the Month.""  They probably do this so you'll have a reason to buy the Premier League Goals of the Season DVD.  I wish I had purchased that DVD instead of this one, but now I'm less likely to shell out money for another Premier League production because of their lame approach to the DVD I bought.  I could think I five ways to make this DVD much, much better.  A shame.",1282003200,,885,4.392638036809816
