2415652,4,B000BFH2W8,"I watched this movie at the wish of a friend of mine who truly enjoys black comedy films. I expected it to be another House Party or and Irish Booty Call.. Given the title, it sounded like a film that just couldn't be taken seriously. But I was wrong, this movie was actually funny and has heart!! I have been to many small towns in Ireland.. Places like this still endure and still exist.

I only gave it less than 5 stars because although it is a good movie, I felt that the writing could have been blended better. The comedy is side-splitting, and the drama actually welled my eyes up.. but the timing was a bit off.. it jumped too quickly between the two. The cinimatography was also excellent!!",1142985600,3,699,4.376923076923077
2415653,1,B000BFH2W8,"If I could rate this film lower as in 000000.  This film is well deserving of triple digit zero's.  I would not recommend this whatever one might call it to anyone.  It really has such an unrealistic approach followed by tasteless, mis-crossed cultural perceptions that are totally unrealistic with a non-creative flair of deception both to Irish and African American culture.

This film was not worth the money or time to create and is certainly not worth to time to watch....",1142553600,3,477,4.851851851851852
2415654,4,B000BFH2W8,I hesitated buying this DVD because of the title.  I know that doesn't make much sense but the title is what initially attracts me to a movie I'm not familiar with.  I like Eddie Griffin as an actor and entertainer so I took a chance.  It's a good movie!  Eddie was Eddie in this fish out of water tale and it worked great.  I don't know what I would have called it but I think the name it'self kept this film from getting the recognition it deserves.  It's well worth the watch and it's something the whole family can enjoy (13 and up)!,1142294400,3,537,4.165048543689321
2415655,4,B000BFH2W8,"Irish Jam was one of those movies that had me laughing all the way through. Eddie Griffin stars in a film about a rapper who enters a contest, thinking that he's going to win something else, when in fact he wins the deed to a failing Irish Pub. The people that live in a small town in Ireland come up with a plan to giveaway the deed to one of the pubs, in hopes that the newcomer will come in and keep the town from being sold. The people create this poetry contest and Griffin's character enters this contests and ends up winning, and of course goes off to Ireland to find that he has to run a pub in town that's trying to avoid being sold. He mostly ends up going to Ireland to avoid his overzealous ex-girlfriend, and forget his failing rap career. The most hilarious moments are when Griffin's character, Jimmy, tries to help the people of the town become more ""hip"" in the ways of his own urban lifestyle.

I suggest this movie to anyone, it made me laugh, and it kept me interested. It's the kind of film that shows the clashing of cultures and the acceptance of difference in others, but does it in a way that keeps you amused and interested. I think you'll find that you will enjoy this movie, and I urge you to give it a chance! You'll be laughing all the way through.",1140739200,9,1278,4.237704918032787

2415666,5,B000BFH2W8,"this movie is by far a great family movie, it has drama, love, comedy, & compassion all rolled up in one. it has love but no love making(sorry horndoggs no sex sene)& i don't think that there were any cussing in it, which is hard to believe when you mention Eddie Griffin. i believe that it has brought out Eddie's true acting skills, he did a great job for this film, i don't think any other actor/comedian could've pulled it off. i don't like it when people spoil a movie by telling me every detail of it, so i won't do that far you. i will say that the relationship between the 2 main stars felt so real, & the teary eyed section near the end actually looked like they were really crying, & yes i said teary eyed, it even had me in tears & i'm a grown ass man. as brief summary of the film you got a broke conartist from L.A. who ends up in an Irish town that's bout to be bought out & sold by a rich conartist. as i repeat this movie has drama, love, comedy, & compassion, fun to watch. so there you go, now go buy it!!!",1368403200,,1024,4.0
2415667,1,B000BFH2W8,"The premise sounds good, and Eddie Griffin has the potential to be a likable character, but he isn't in this.  They don't take enough time to develop his, or any other character.  This really seemed rushed and thrown together and is not worth watching.",1343088000,,252,4.704545454545454
2415668,2,B000BFH2W8,"I gave this film 2 stars only for the music of traditional Irish group Lunasa and the beautiful singing of Anna Friel. Other than that there is no reason to watch this. It is basically your fish out of water story that was done so well in films like ""Crocodile Dundee"". This time however we have a black hip-hop con artist placed in a small Irish community. It was an interesting premise but Eddie Griffith holds it back from reaching it's potential. He looks and acts like a cartoon character. Watching this was like watching ""Who framed Roger Rabbit?"" with live actors interacting with cartoon characters. We are asked to accept that the beautiful Anna Friel falls in love with this foul talking wreck of a human being. It is not beyond the realm of possibilty but we are never given any good reason why she would. In the end, we are supposed to believe that the Irish communitys acceptance of him as a human being brings about change in him as a person. It does not ring true, and in one of the extras on the DVD we see an interview with Griffith about the film where it is apparent he has little understanding of what the whole point of the story was. Who did they make this film for?",1339200000,,1188,4.380090497737557
2415669,1,B000BFH2W8,"This movie was beyond bad. The story, the predictable stereotypical characters...it all came together to make a horrible film. I'm not a big fan of Eddie Griffin but he was especially bad in this, but you can't really blame him with that god-awful script. Any stereotypical, peculiar white/black un-funny lines you can think of was in this movie. I can't begin to go into depth about how much I loathe this movie, I'm choking on my own rage here!",1235088000,,446,4.658227848101266

2415672,3,B000BFH2W8,"Irish Jam is a cute story, pretty well written, and pretty well acted, and filmed in a beautiful locale.

It is the story of a con man who goes gooey, and buys his own con, or goes good, depending on your perspective (The Music Man, Curley Sue etc, etc.). A fatherless child sees the good in a hustler that no one else can sense, and then changes his life. There are some funny parts, lots of stereotypes, a far fetched romance, and a happy ending.

All in all, not a bad way to spend an hour and a half.",1211673600,,504,4.08080808080808

this movie steryotypes irish, and promotes hollywood gangsterism. enough said",1186876800,3,605,4.761904761904762
2415683,5,B000BFH2W8,"Ms. ""Triple zeros"" and Mr. ""culture,"" Could you please elaborate on what exactly was so bad about the movie?  Example; I'm Cuban, and I'm offended by Scarface.  Why because it has an Italian American(as if they couldn't find any aspiring Cuban actors)playing a Cuban Mafioso.  Reality is most Cubans in Miami are middle class, politically, and socially conservative.  What's more if they're 1st generation they don't speak broken and retarded English to their relatives.  They speak the Spanish of their birth.

  There's an example for you of a critique.  What exactly did you find objectionable about Irish Jam?

  I liked it because it sends a message to American culture that Ireland isn't some kind of magical fairyland where every body looks like a leprechaun, tells jokes, drinks beer, and is after the pot of gold.

  In fact in the movie there's a part where the English schemer, and corporate monger wants everyone to dress as lepracuans in his new theme park.  The townspeople are offended by it, and finally there is an expression by something like a movie that Ireland is made up of real people, with real problems, and not leprechuans.  They also are facing the same enemy today that has plagued us since the begining of History, the rich, and the greedy to get richer.  I also especially liked the singing by the main female character played by Cathy Murphy.",1174348800,4,1373,4.844827586206897
2415684,1,B000BFH2W8,"This film had a good story line.  What killed it was the Eddie Griffin who could not act his way off a set of stairs and a total lack of story telling from the director and the editor.  If the production company would have left the grips, food service, make-up and just folks standing around watching it being filmed,  in charge of the direction and editing it would have been better.  Dumping Eddie it could have been great.

There were some great performances from the supporting cast, but it was all overshadowed from the lack of continuity of the story line and ego from the main character.",1174176000,,594,4.514018691588785
2415685,1,B000BFH2W8,"There is a racist comment on the cover for crying out loud! I am tired of the paddy this and that, Irish pennants, paddy wagon, and luck of the Irish. If this movie follows 90 percent of the urban movies I have seen it is going to make white people evil and helpless. Please leave our culture alone crap. I hate rap and love Irish music. Please leave Irish music alone. This is a waste of film. It was not even filmed in Ireland but England with no real Irish actors. I would not even give this a star. Please leave the Irish culture alone it is all we have left.",1148947200,3,563,4.081081081081081
2415686,4,B000BFH2W8,"This film had all the potential to be a throwaway teen comedy, but instead is surprisingly good.  I wasn't familiar with Eddie Griffin, the man has some funny and clever raps ( as in talking not rhyming ).  One of those rare films that manages to combine hilarity and sincerity.  It isn't perfect of course, sometimes overdoing it or just being silly, but all in all it is definitely better than average. It also turns the typical white man saving the ignorant savages premise on its head.  If you cling to antiquated and erroneous racial notions this film is going to make you squat a brick.",1145923200,4,592,4.556603773584905

I did squirm a little over the predictable parts, and there were several, but it wasn't that bad. It's the basic story of 'bad boy' getting a break, getting the girl, etc. I did like the acting and the 'fish out of water' plot. I was looking for a surprise ending, but didn't get one.
