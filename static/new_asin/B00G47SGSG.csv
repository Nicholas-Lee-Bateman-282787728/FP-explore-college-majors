8620530,2,B00G47SGSG,"I'm usually a big fan of British cop/crime/detective films; not so much this one. Lots of yelling. Harrigan never does what his ""boss"" tells him too. Harrigan confronts bad guys and manages to solve some problems while the guy that took his place at the office gets reports and charts written up. For some reason I had a hard time understanding what was being said. some heavy accents going on. Don't think this movie is worth a watch unless your enjoy the actors.",1531094400,,464,4.602409638554217
8620531,3,B00G47SGSG,"Look, this film is not at all interesting.  Stephen Tompkinson is a detective (DS, with a tragic and gritty backstory) who yells at people (which wins everyone over by the end), which means the base rating is three stars.  That said, I too would not recommend the film.  There are not enough scenes with Tompkinson yelling at people to justify more than three stars.  The plot did not ... hang together.  I believed none of what was happening in the film.  There is no saving grace.  Come for the vague hint of detective genre stuff, realistic-ish violence, unexplained and unanswered domestic violence (except in that warrior makes-it-all-better-way) or Stephen Tompkinson yelling at people; leave...wondering why you watched it..",1530748800,,731,5.1440677966101696

8620533,1,B00G47SGSG,Really? one of the worst British detective films ever. Not worth the time watching this low budget B movie.,1510185600,,107,4.684210526315789

8620535,5,B00G47SGSG,"I very much enjoyed this movie. Stephen Tompkinson does a superb job. I like this movie because it shows that even in hard times when everybody was struggling and having to cut back, one does not cut back on his believes, integrity and justice. Even when some do. The acting is brilliant, you can see how much he is tormented by the injustice and turning of a blind eye. To think that this is based on a true person makes it so much more compelling. I was just a child back at that time and really don't remember any of this going on while I grew up in Germany, but it is a time that shouldn't be forgotten. To help this will not happen again. I have watched that movie 3 times now and every time I do I enjoy it more and more.",1418169600,5,727,4.055555555555555
8620536,3,B00G47SGSG,"Detective Harrigan (Stephen Tompkinson) returns to his old neighborhood after working in Hong Kong. It is Jan. 1974. Due to budgets cuts, the police work at reduced pay and numbers. Some of the precincts have been closed. Hooligans control the streets and in Harrigan's neighborhood it is Dunstan (Craig Conway) a man who wears a clown mask when he kills.

Harrigan also deals with a criminal justice system that is more criminal than justice. He has decided to reopen a precinct right in the middle of the worst area, hand selecting a few work mates to come with him. He works outside the law to achieve results, creating problems as well as solving them.

The film is violent with the last 15 minutes going to the extreme. While I gave it 3 stars, it is not a film I would recommend.",1394064000,4,785,4.560283687943262
