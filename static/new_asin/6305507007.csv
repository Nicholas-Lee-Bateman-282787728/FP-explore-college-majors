7891049,4,6305507007,My husband and I and our first son spent the summer of 1971 in Doddridge County WV.  We saw this movie when it was first released and were awed by the wonderful views of a place where we were welcomed and treated well.  I've looked for the film over the years to replace our original VHS copy.  Glad to see there are still some copies around.  This film is basically a one man show and a young Martin Sheen did an amazing job in his portrayal of a consciences objector.  The writer took some liberties as he set the story during the Civil War when it actually occurred in 1917-1918 but that doesn't negatively effect the movie at all.  A must for Martin Sheen fans and for lovers of West Virginia.  Low budget film but some lovely cinematography.,1425168000,,746,4.36231884057971
7891050,5,6305507007,"A very well done, yet low budget film, about one man's refusal to fight in the Civil War.  I was a 12 years old when it was filmed and spent most of the summer of 1970 on the set during filming.  My uncle was a high school friend of Clyde Ware (the director) and many of the scenes were shot on his farm in Blandville, WV.  I remember filming the bear scene and how the bear ""got away"" for a few minutes -- quite exciting.

A piece of trivia, David Nelson of Ozzie and Harriett fame, was a camera man on the film.

I re-watch every year of so and always enjoy.  Great family film.",1247529600,,580,4.0

7891052,4,6305507007,"When I first saw this movie as Child it left a big impression on me. I recently purchased the Direct Source VHS version and the story and acting still stand up pretty well. Still One of my all time favourites. Martin Sheen doing an early rehearsal for Apocalypse Now.

The film which features Martin Sheen for the most part is the only actor onscreen. Most of the other characters are filmed at a distance or photographed from Sheen's perspective. An interesting tool in filmmaking.

Sheen's performance has never been bettered and he's given some standout ones over the years.

The VHS copy is a little washed out at times but overall it didn't spoil my enjoyment. I look forward in this Digital age to seeing a DVD copy with commentaries from Director/Actor. Anyone in the business, take note.",1103068800,3,795,4.746376811594203
7891053,5,6305507007,"Probably no film captures more realistically and poetically the joy, sorrow, simplicity and freedom of isolation. As well as the yearning for human contact and man's spiritual bond with nature.  This is unlike any  movie I have ever seen.  Sheen is the only person in the movie that you  actually see fully.  Other characters are seldom shown.  Instead we only  hear them or see them partially.  This brings the viewer to feel the  alienation Sheen undergoes in his self-exile from society.  The music is  beautiful and carries us along gracefully until the climactic and  unforgettable ending.",946857600,4,594,5.072916666666667
