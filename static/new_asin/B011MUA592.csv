7337471,5,B011MUA592,"As a full grown college adult, this is easily my favorite show of all time, and I don't give that title out just to any show I like. This exciting tale is a full fledged story filled with many intelligent archs complemented by A level writing and stunning visuals. Even as a adult you can get thoroughly enjoy this series as there are multiple levels of writing that will go over the heads of kids, but just genius for the more mature. You will not be disappointed with this purchase as most of you probably already know.",1443312000,,521,4.381443298969073
7337472,5,B011MUA592,One of the best tv shows of all time. Story is gripping. Fighting and action is unreal and incredibly choreographed. Character growth is relatable and real. I will never not love avatar the last airbender. I REALLY wish this was being released on blu-Ray but I'm am still most definitely buying this collection,1442707200,3,310,4.867924528301887

7337474,5,B011MUA592,"It's an amazing show!
That being said: when is this coming to Blu Ray?  Legens of Korra (made by the same people for those who may not be aware) was put out on Blu-ray immediately after release. Last Air Bender has been out for years and though a complete collection has been long overdue, so has a blu-ray release.
I still gave it 5 stars because though I'm disappointed by the format it isn't that big of a deal and the show deserves 5 stars.",1441843200,3,444,4.223529411764706
7337475,5,B011MUA592,"Definitely a great show for the whole family to watch, appreciate, and enjoy.  I already purchased this on DVD when it was first released on single season releases.  So there is no need for me to buy this again on DVD.  However, if this was on Blu-ray, then I would buy it again in this format.",1441152000,2,294,4.214285714285714
7337476,2,B011MUA592,"Okay, so i already owned the entire series from the three book box sets and sad they didn't look good on an HD tv. Then this is announced and I was like ""hey, maybe it'll finally be in better quality(even in 3:4 which i don't mind at all) since its 2015 and the last set was released 7 years ago!"". Well sadly, to my surprise...THESE ARE THE EXACT SAME DISKS YOU GET IN THE OTHER BOX SET, EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM IS EXACTLY THE SAME, NO CHANGES, NO UPDATED QUALITY FOR HD TVS, EXACT SAME DVDS. I first noticed this before I even put the disk in my system as the first box set has 6 disks and the two other books only have 5 disks. This is the same case as the other box sets released 7 YEARS AGO. I love avatar, it is my favorite show in all existence and one of the only things that can bring me joy in this world. I am so so deeply saddened that the avatar team would allow this to be resold like this, especially in this day and age.
NOW, if you don't own any avatar disks or downloads of the show, then yes, I will say that this is the best option to get all of the show for form factor and size of box, but the other boxes looked prettier at least with nice art, so I really cant believe the disks are exactly the same.

***BELOW IS MY REVIEW FROM BEFORE I GOT THE PACKAGE, THIS IS MY REAL REVIEW AFTER GETTING THE PACKAGE***

ATLA is the greatest show(animated and not) to ever come out and even though i have the 3 book sets of all the episodes, I have already preordered this one and hope they release the Korra set soon after. This would be the best option to get if you are looking to watch the show. I hope everything is updated to look good on an HD screen, even if it has to be 4:3 i hope itll look better than the previous book editions that i own. Sad they didn't go with bluray, but not everyone has a player so I guess I understand.",1441152000,112,1847,3.9891891891891893
7337477,5,B011MUA592,A:TLA is in my opinion one of the greatest childrens cartoons produced. I am so excited to receive this on October 6th. I do however agree with the other reviewer I wish it was in bluray but no matter the format im so excited to watch it all over again.,1440806400,7,253,4.08
7337478,5,B011MUA592,"Avatar was one of my favorite cartoon shows of all time. The art, story, and characters just resonated me as a child and it instantly became a part of my childhood. I think at this point, anyone who doesn't live under a rock, knows what Avatar is. What I am going to explain, is why you should buy this DVD set. If you're like me and want to collect all 3 DVDs for this show, but never liked the cover art or thought that the price tag was too high,  then I think this DVD set is for you. The average price per season is $14.00 if you decide to buy each DVDs separately, the total would come out to $42. There is actually already a completely DVD set for Avatar the Last Airbender, but it costs around $46 dollars on another website. Overall, the $30 price tag is amazing! You get all 3 DVDs for a huge discount and premium packaging. I think the cover art looks amazing and overall better than the 3 DVDs would look if you purchased them separately.

Note: All three seasons of Avatar are free for Amazon Prime members on Prime Video. If you want a physical copy to add to the collection of your bookshelf or you're not a Prime member, then I would suggest you take advantage this set right here.",1440633600,23,1197,4.222707423580786
7337479,5,B011MUA592,"The show is absolutely fantastic, but why won't Nickelodeon spring for a blu-ray release?  I'd snatch that up in a jiffy and I'm sure a lot of other fans would as well.  It's a shame.",1440633600,59,183,4.2
7337480,5,B011MUA592,The Greatest Animated Series of all time gets re released and though I wish it were on Blu Ray I will definately be purchasing this collection. Avatar is overall the story of how long term violence and hatred affect multiple society's especially children. It is filled with deep themes and story lines that will draw in the young and old. It has great action and animation. And finally great performances especially grey delisle as Azula who gives one of the greatest supporting actress roles of all time. Avatar is perfect a true masterpiece and although I already own the complete series I will gladly buy it again just to have the excuse for a rewatch.,1440028800,22,655,4.7043478260869565

7337593,5,B011MUA592,"Avatar is an AMAZING series. It manages to be mature, subtle, tackle dark themes, funny, a good anime, entertaining for kids and adults. It's one one the best Kid's shows and one of the best TV shows EVER.

For newbies the premise will be a little weird; through martial art, some people can control one element (Water, Earth, Fire, or Air) and one special person can control all of them. From there just watch the show and be amazed.

This show cleverly introduced Eastern Philosophy to me and many others, how many kids shows can say the smartly introduced children to anything, let alone a complex philosophy?

The characters are some of the most vivid and well written in the entire history of Televison; from a young airbender coping with the horrors of being the last of his kind, to a teenage prince trying (and constantly failing) to restore his honor.

This is an incredible show and I cannot recommend it enough.

The blu ray collection is very nice and has some really neat extras. My only nitpick is you cannot chapter skip past the intro, you can only fastforward manually. Such a small thing, it's barely worth mentioning.

Buy it and you won't be disappointed.",1534636800,,1175,4.679611650485437

7337620,5,B011MUA592,"First before I get into the review of the actual Blu-ray set, I would like to start off by saying that this series is amazing, great characters, action, and a beautiful story, an absolute must watch if youve never seen, and definitely worth the rewatch if you have.  Everyone from all ages can enjoy this incredible show.

Now, getting into the actual Blu-ray set, it truly was everything I couldve asked for from this set plus more.  I was most worried about the quality of the video before buying it, as I was unsure if it was going to be in HD or just SD transfered over from the DVD set.  Lucky the makers of this set put the time and effort into getting this show in 1080P and it looks beautiful, you can tell that the show wasn't original in HD and just upscaled and reworked, but still looks beautiful and better then I thought it would.  Also I was also concerned that the video would be stretched to wide screen, as its labeled as wide screen on the box, however this is not the case and looks just like it did 10 plus years ago when it was released on Nick.  The sound on the blu-ray set is also HD remastered as well, however I do not know if this was the same on the DVD set or a new adition to the Blu-ray.

Not only is the video and sound perfect in this set but so is the packaging.  This set comes with two beautiful and different art works with the pullover sleave and the actual case, both worthy to be put on display.  The case is also sturdy, with safe snap it slots the fold on top of eachother like a plastic book.  This case is exactly what i look for in a Blu-ray set, as I hate the sets where the case is paper and you have to slide the discs into paper slots where it feels like you are malesting the discs every time you pull them in or out.  This case is beautiful and keeps your Blu-ray safe, the best of both worlds.

In conclusion, this Blu-ray set is everything I look for in sets of this nature and blow my mind away with the quality of this set.  The video and sound quality is perfect, along with a beautiful and safe case that you will want to show off to to your friends and family.  This set is definitely worth the pick up if you are looking to rewatch this incredible show, or dive into the World of Avatar for the first time, and is an absolute steal for on 30 dollars.",1534032000,,2310,4.104444444444445

7337626,5,B011MUA592,"This is an absolutely amazing series, it deserved a blu-ray complete version a long long time ago, but will happily support this over and over again.
This is a really great price, Most people have blu-ray players now, and would seriously suggest you upgrade if you do not. There are a lot of new negative reviews saying there are missing episodes. What they did on the blu-ray is combined a lot of episodes together. The entire last few episodes in the fire nation book have been put together into one big episode almost in movie format.

It's nothing like the typical garbage kids shows you see nowadays. There is some violence, but it doesn't undermine the wholesomeness of the show. Anyone with a heart will fall in love with these characters and how deep and well written they are, and how much they care about each other. I'm a grown man, and this show has made me teary eyed on more than one occasion, not because it was sad, but because it made me so happy to see the love and compassion regularly expressed by the main characters. This is technically a kids show, but it is definitely appropriate for adults too. Couldn't be happier with this blu-ray collection.",1533859200,,759,4.547445255474453

But after a quick Amazon search I found these DVDs for such a great price! The box they come in is super cool and sturdy and all the discs were included, unopened, and are playing great! I wish there was a paper insert that had a list or guide to all the episodes, but a quick google search usually pulls up what we need. I am amazed at the quality and getting the entire series at such a great price!
And I am happy to say that my boyfriend was right and I LOVE this series! As I've gotten older, I've grown out of a lot of the cartoons/series I once loved, but this one seems to really appeal to older audiences and has an amazing storyline that is complex and compelling enough to keep me begging my boyfriend to play the next episode!

7337682,5,B011MUA592,"This Blu Ray set is the best the show has ever looked, no question. I appreciate the original aspect ratio being preserved instead of it being stretched out to 16:9. There are some issues with the picture, though. Large fields of solid color or certain visual effects show a lot of noise in the picture. I remember first noticing it in the Book 1 episode The King of Omashu, but it is most obvious during the Book 1 finale. There's a part where most of the screen is covered with a red color effect. Everything affected by this has a digital fuzziness to it. This is less of an issue in the other two seasons but it's sill there. Maybe something to fix with a remaster later on?

There's a ton of special features and commentaries, though they are all from previous releases. It's a real shame that the Avatar Extras pop up facts weren't included. I'd have been happy even if they had included them as an extra subtitle track. I also wish they had taken this opportunity to create some new special features or interviews or something, especially since this is the 10 year anniversary of the series finale.

Some people have reported that there's been a few cuts in the show. Nothing too significant, just a few seconds of footage. Apparently the Book 2 episode The Chase has some content missing. I can't say if this is true or not myself, but it might be something to keep in mind.

Overall, I can't think of a better way to watch the show, but I can't help but feel like this could have been even better than it is. Maybe just a couple new special features, new interviews, and especially adding in the Avatar Extras.",1532217600,,1619,4.444444444444445

7337688,4,B011MUA592,"First off, Avatar: The Last Airbender is an amazing show, and any fan should have the complete collection in their collection. This Blu-Ray collection is not remastered in HD. There may be some upscaling, but it looks about like what Id expect from a DVD set.

I think the disc setup for this collection could have been handled better. Each disc has 8 episodes on it, for three discs per season. The problem is that this doesnt always correlate to the chapters accessible from the disc menu. Starting with Season 2, two-or-more-part episodes show as a single chapter, yet its up to the viewer to remember which episodes have multiple parts. The last disc is particularly confusing if you're not prepared for it; it only has 2 chapters on it, since Sozins Comet, the final set of episodes, has 4 parts. Watching the whole last chapter all the way through is a near-2-hour commitment. Even more confusing, the first combo episode is in Season 2, with Episode 12-13 (The Serpents Pass and The Drill) combined into one chapter. This is extra weird because while these are rather related to each other, they're not branded as two parts to the same episode/

I kind of see why they bundled mutli-part episodes together, but I think it would have been better if they specified when they did this in the disk menu. For example, I would have been happier if the last disk had its chapters named Nightmares and Daydreams and Sozins Comet (4 episodes). Alternately, just listing the run-time of each chapter would convey roughly the same information and make it easier to plan what to watch.",1531958400,4,1580,4.721014492753623

Pros:
Sounds great to me, I like the menu layout and each disc has a different character on the main menu, has really cool slip on cover, image quality is nice most of the time (seems better starting with pirates episode), various special features I remember being on TV included. Some cons: at least on disc 1, there was some weird line quality and a kind of fuzziness at times but nothing major, rarely see random black spec on screen, the special features (at least some) were not in hd, but it made me realize the huge quality improvement in the first episodes compared to DVDs (the ghosting lines). The story is obviously great, and if it's a matter of them doing the best they could considering it's age and how it was made, I'm happy with my purchase. Just knowing that the bluray dics have more protection against scratches is reassuring. It is 4:3, but I'm not bothered by it. Most TVs let you zoom or widen the image anyway. With mine on wide, the quality isn't suffering and I get a slightly wider image.",1531440000,,1213,4.371681415929204

7337728,5,B011MUA592,"When my now adult children were much younger, this was a Friday night staple. Sometimes I'd casually join in and watch, but most times I simply watched passively or just goofed around on the internet. It was Nickelodeon and just seemed like your typical adventure series that I either didn't understand or just didn't find interesting enough to watch regularly. When it would peak my interest, I would be frustrated because I felt I had missed too much to become fully involved. Then...I got a little older and a little wiser. When it became available on Prime a few years after its initial run, my slightly older teenage son convinced me to start at the beginning and give it a watch through, which we did as a family.

That was probably about five years ago.

In that time, I have watched the series, in its entirety, once a year. Usually it's binged in a week or so.

For the last year or two I have wondered time and again when this would get a Blu Ray release, like Korra has (and Korra wasn't anywhere near as great as this series). Finally it's here and I couldn't be happier!!

The picture and sound quality are fantastic and it has all the features from the DVD set, but in full HD.

The slipcover art is probably the coolest cover art of any Blu Ray set I own, but that's just the icing on the cake.

Avatar is, by far, one of the most engaging and sublime series ever to grace the small screen. It has all the elements of great adventure storytelling. It has a likeable, yet flawed, hero. It has an interesting antagonist that is constantly wrestling with his own inner conflict. Personally, I feel this entire series is just as much about Zuko as it is Aang. It has a great ensemble of characters, each fleshed out wonderfully. So much so, that you find yourself invested in nearly every single character that you encounter. Toph and Iroh are probably my favorite overall characters, even though they all are so captivating. It has a great balance of comedy and drama. I mean this is probably the best writing in an animated series, with the close exception being Batman The Animated Series. It doesn't dumb things down for kids, especially when it comes to the metaphysical and philosophic aspects of the story. It deals with some dark subject matters at times...and it shows not everyone just walks away unscathed.

I could go on and on, but if you haven't watched this show in its entirety, I can't recommend it enough!",1530835200,,2434,4.54337899543379
7337729,4,B011MUA592,"Compared to DVD quality w/ 2.0 stereo AND upscaled 720p w/ 5.1 surround (a very impressive upscale), and the luray is easily the best quality for the series thus far. I do wish there was an option for surround (hence the fifth star absent), but thankfully audio gear and speakers both have a matrix for creating a virtual 5.1 without any issue. Still, if the audio was remastered with modern tech in mind, it'd be a perfect set. Still, for this price ($30), this is easily the definition of MUST-HAVE amongst all the options. Especially compared to the recent Samurai Jack bluray, which I got as well for $80, this is a steal as work was actually done to make the visual experience the best possible. SJ, while a fantastic series, is an absolutely laughable bluray. Avatar Aang for the proverbial win.",1530748800,,801,4.647887323943662
7337730,5,B011MUA592,"Really happy to have the Blu-ray of this series in my collection. Was a gift for my 10 year old, but I love it too!",1530662400,,115,3.64
7337731,3,B011MUA592,"I previously owned the DVD collection of Avatar: The Last Airbender and with the first volume in particular it was quite an eye sore. All the edges had what I would call ghosting and it obscured most details, but the show itself is one of the best cartoons of all time so I still watched it and did my best to enjoy it.

Now years later they announce the blu-ray and I excitedly pre-order it thinking they are going to remaster it! I know it will still be 4:3 aspect ratio, that is how cartoons at that time were made, but they could get the original footage and possibly even mix the audio in 5.1? Nope. I've seen pirated and streamed copies of this show that look better. I do need to preface this saying that since I just got this today I have so far only watched the first disc, as it was the one I was most concerned about.

Sure they mostly fixed the ghosting issue, but that is about it. Still in stereo. The video is still quite pixelated on an HD screen, possibly moreso since it isn't as blurry. This looks like they found a 480p rip and just upsampled it to 1080p and applied an unsharp mask. Most of the edges suffer from obvious unsharpening where every line goes white, then black, then white again before continuing with the correct color. Many of the shapes that should be solid color instead have a texture to them that is created by lossy compression and will change from frame to frame. Also some frames seem to be smeared during action scenes or with lip movements while talking that leads me to believe the framerate was artificially changed at some point, which makes it seem sometimes out of sync with the dialogue or like the timing is slightly off or hard to follow.

I don't have the ability to take screen captures from blu-ray at this time, but I found a screenshot online and used some photoshop to try to recreate what I'm talking about. One is what the DVD looked like, another what the bluray looked like, and another is a close up of the unsharp mask, low res, and compression effects I have been discussing.

Overall I still give this a 3/5 because it is one of the best cartoons of all time, and the blu-ray version is better than the DVD version I had, it just still isn't the ideal version I hoped it would be. So far the best quality seems to be streaming on Amazon video? Why couldn't the Blu-ray get those files? Can we get them later? A true remaster? Is 5.1 audio too much to ask?",1530662400,9,2422,4.316483516483516

It is clear something happened during the conversion process to Blu-ray (maybe when capturing the source frames or when encoding them into the Blu-ray format) that resulted in a level of quality that is not up to par with what you would expect from a Blu-ray release like this. If the original frames still exist (maybe they don't but I'm guessing they do), then there's no reason why they couldn't create a Blu-ray that looked amazing. With all that said, this Blu-ray is still the best quality you can buy. And for those who are complaining that it isn't widescreen and is instead the original 4:3 aspect ratio, understand that the show was designed to be 4:3, was animated to be 4:3, and was mastered to be 4:3.

However, I'd give the Blu-Ray edition a 4.5/5 star rating. While the cover is beautiful, and I am of course super excited that they finally came out with a Blu-Ray edition, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the outer box. I own a few collector's edition Blu-Ray sets (my favorite being Lord of the Rings, which comes in a beautiful, sturdy, high-quality box), and this ATLA ""box"" (which is really more of an outer cover than a box) felt a little flimsy in comparison. It also arrived with a small crease/dent in it. It's not a huge deal, hence the 4.5 stars, but I would have gladly spent $10 extra for a higher-quality box that looks more fancy and will last much longer.

This becomes more annoying when you realize the special features are spread out on ALL of the discs. It could have easily been a 4 disc set with one more for all the special features. Also they're not labeled, so if you wanna watch a specific episode it kinda becomes a chore.

First thing I should clear up because Amazon puts the DVD reviews in with the Blu-ray for some strange reason: The ""double-line"" issues of Book One's first disc has been FIXED! That alone made it worth it to me. There are times when the animation itself is wonky, but this show is 13 years old now and wasn't made with HD quality so .

Naturally, it still also has the full screen aspect ratio (black bars on the side), but that's to be expected. Just wanted to put that out there if that bothers anyone.

The box is nice and didn't arrive broken. I like the two different covers on the sleeve and on the case itself. I wish there was a bit more ""artfullness""  to the inside and the discs themselves, as they all look the same. I recommend everyone making sure they have all the right numbered discs when you buy it, just in case.

I bought it for $30 and it is worth it. That comes out to $10 a season. Considering a few years ago, people were trying to sell all the DVD Sets for $60-100+ on eBay, you might as well get the Blu-Ray",1528675200,26,1081,4.177884615384615

My disappointment set in when I saw the screen ration is 4x3 and the audio is 2 channel Dolby pro. I will enjoy the show but unfortunately this is not the upgrade I was hoping for. Maybe in the future they will release it again with a proper upgrade.",1528502400,2,585,4.4766355140186915
7337802,5,B011MUA592,"Amazon was out of stock so I had to make this purchase at Walmart.

Let me try to explain a few things that people still don't understand involving video quality and whatnot. Avatar: The Last Airbender aired from 2003 to 2005, and like most shows from this era, were broadcast in 4:3 at 480i a.k.a., standard definition. A 16:9, or widescreen, version of this show simply DOES NOT EXIST. The only way for this show to be released in 16:9 would be to stretch and crop the image, removing parts of the image. This was done on the Orange Brick DBZ sets and there are plenty of comparisons you can find to show just how much is actually cut off. The only other option would be to add in backgrounds and overlays, essentially reanimating the show. Disney has done this with some of the older animated films to mixed result, and a fair amount of criticism. If you are upset about black bars on your screen, then your television should have a function to manually change the zoom of your display.

Next, let's talk about resolutions. When Avatar was first broadcast, it was shown at 480i (standard definition). DVDs are also mastered at standard definition. Now, unless I am mistaken, Avatar was drawn and produced at 720i, obviously a higher definition. If that is the case, that would mean that when Avatar was broadcast and released on DVD, it was downscaled and compressed. This leads to problems such as artifacting, blurriness, ghosting, double lines, and a restricted color range. I know for a fact that DVD releases were prone to some of these issues. Avatar being released on blu-ray is the first time this show has been seen entirely uncompressed, relatively free of visual errors.

I have been watching the blu-ray and the video quality is simply incredible. Clean, pristine, and rich with color. I don't mean to be condescending, but the people complaining about aspect ratio and video quality are just plain wrong. This is the best this show has ever been. Forty bucks is a bargain for what you're getting here. If only Viz and Funimation cared this much about their classics, we wouldn't have to settle for substandard releases of Sailor Moon and DBZ.",1528416000,15,2158,4.718832891246684
7337803,2,B011MUA592,"Didnt purchase this on Amazon, picked it up in Store instead because it was sold out. Wish I would have read the reviews a little more closely and sadly Im going to have to return this. Dont get me wrong, I love the series its one of the greatest ever. The problem? Its the aspect ratio. I own a plasma TV, meaning if I have those black bars on the side my tv will burn if it is left on for more than a few hours. This isn't me being picky, and usually I would get over these things. There is no excuse at this point, this is a cheap money grab from Nick. This Blu-ray version is barely that, there is a lot of shows that were filmed in lower aspect ratios that they have modified for HD TVs and Blu-Ray to make them full the whole screen and still look great (The Dragon Ball Z Blu-Rays are a great example of this). Not only does it fill an HD Tv but the quality isn't much better from the DVD releases, granted they fixed the blurry vision. Also the special features are mainly just used from the original so not a lot of new content for die hard fans. They really need to listen to their fans, it sold out so obviously people are ready to buy these. I will wait until they release a better version for this. It really bums me out because I was really excited to watch this amazing series again. I was waiting for this version for a long time and my dreams were crushed.",1528416000,,1373,4.070110701107011

That said, the blu-ray release is very disappointing.  I am quite OK with them leaving the original 4:3 ratio intact.  The handful of special features are alright also, but sparse and re-used.  My disappointment comes entirely from the very poor (and maybe non-existent?) cleanup on the animation.  The image quality is distractingly dirty.  I was so impressed with the Korra blu-rays -- I just expected the same care out of these.

I was very excited to have one of my favorite series release on Blu-Ray with the expectation that it would be a crisp, widescreen, HD version. Unfortunately, it is only a 4:3 upconvert with only a slight improvement in quality over the DVD release.

While this is not too surprising, it is especially disappointing considering the packaging and menu presentation. The case naturally lists the format as ""1080p High Definition"" and the discs themselves are labeled ""Widescreen"". Sadly, it is really only the Disc Menus that are HD (well, and the anti-piracy warnings...). It is a large letdown to see the crisp, HD menu, with widescreen icons in the episode selection, followed by the lackluster upconvert. (And the special features only seem to be in SD.)

After trading in my original DVD Set at a trade-in store I got $20.00 back for the Series... had called ahead to Best Buy being as this is an Exclusive there on May 1st and they are selling out!!! Went there and after Price Matching with Amazon + my trade-in + my Best Buy $5.00 Rewards I paid a total of $11.00 for the new Blu-Ray Set first day of release!!!!
The picture quality is a HUGE improvement over my original Avatar DVDs! Both in cleanness of Line-detail and most significantly in Color!
The Sound is also much improved. The Colors are Bright and Crisp! And when Aang goes into the Avatar State the backlighting from the LED Screen to the Blu-Ray glows much more significantly than the flat, dreary, blurry picture of the DVD.

The Subtitles are in typical white, smaller, Blu-Ray font instead of the ugly, large yellow Subtitles of DVD.

The biggest Dissapointment on watching the Blu-Ray Set is that Amazon's description of the Aspect Ratio is ABSOLUTELY WRONG!!!!
It's most definetly NOT Widescreen or 16:9 Format. It still has the original Pillar Box Black Bars on the side, same as most older TV Shows.
Now, this doesn't really bother me. I have a 2016 4K 55"" Samsung Curved Television and it comes equipped with Custom Picture Manipulation Control through the Menu. Which means I can completly customize the Image Size and on 1080p Blu-Ray or 4K products I don't lose any Picture Quality or detail at all.
So I'm able to watch Avatar or Star Trek The Original Series or any older show as 16:9 without missing any image information, no distortion and no loss of detail whatsoever.
So if you have a similar Smart TV check your Menu for a Picture Customization Option.

All in all, the Blu-Ray Set is most definetly worth it, Especially if you can pull off the $11.00 price tag I got it for and at long long last I have THE LAST AIRBENDER on Blu next to LEGEND OF KORRA on Blu. And I can enjoy both in the BEST QUALITY ever back-to-back!!!!
If you love both Series then so should you! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting both Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend Of Korra on Blu-Ray!

UPDATE : After reading the Forums on Blu-Ray.com the Set is indeed encoded for 16:9 Image but the Image of 16:9 INCLUDES the Pillar Box Style Black Bars which is the correct Image for the Series... if the Image had been 'cropped' to satisfy a Full Screen then it would have been Zoomed In and both Image and detail would have been lost!
So, after this revelation I am very glad Paramount decided to keep the Original Pillar Box Image. And as I said, if you have the Customization Picture Option on your TV it doesn't matter anyway...",1525132800,6,2643,4.523012552301255
7337873,3,B011MUA592,"This series is a five-star for me, but this Blu-Ray release is only a three-star because the show is shown in the 4:3 aspect ratio rather than 16:9.  Considering the vast majority of televisions are now 16:9, this choice is odd and off-putting.

I never noticed the quality of the video of the first season as people have been saying but I personally don't mind because it adds to the nostalgia factor.

7337939,1,B011MUA592,"First of all, do not look at my review of this product as my review of the show. Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the best shows ever written or animated for television. It's a masterful story of learning to become who you're meant to be, and owning your identity. Each season (or book) of the show gets better and better, and the story gets more complex, the animation always fluid and lively, and eventually comes down to being a timeless classic of animation. Five stars. Six stars! Honestly? Ten stars.

The quality is a little low but it's to be expected of a show from the early/mid 2000s, so I'm not too upset with that. I do wish there were subtitles though.

HOWEVER. As a member of Prime this was 2-day shipped to me. They chose LaserShip as the shipping method and I'm frustrated. It arrived late on Friday, the day it was due to be delivered, and delayed delivery until Saturday. Not a big deal, this has happened before, but it's more than just arriving a little late. Upon arrival, the package was severely beaten up, making me nervous about opening it. The box for housing the 3 DVD boxes is completely destroyed. And when I opened up the packaging, the Book 2 (my favorite season) box had a lot of the DVDs fallen out of their places and the bar that keeps the extra DVD pieces in place had fallen out of place. Thankfully all of them seem to play, but I don't like that the display box is now worthless, as I like keeping things together :\. It's clear they weren't careful with the package, and while the show was absolutely worth the price, I have to wonder why Prime members are getting such bad service.",1523318400,2,1628,4.40531561461794

This is WMG again.  As you can see, it looks like they carried over all of the bonus features from the DVDs.  I don't believe there are any new bonus features.  However, according to Amazon.com, the Blu-ray release is going to be shown in widescreen.  This could be good, or bad, depending on your point of view.  ""Avatar"" was originally released in full screen format, so I can see three possibilities here.  1) Amazon is wrong and it is going to be in full screen format.  2) Amazon is correct and they are going to crop the top, and/or bottom, to fill the edges for widescreen.  3) Avatar was originally developed in widescreen and they cropped the edges for full screen televisions at that time.  I'm hoping for number 3.  I'll have to wait and see.  If I see more scenery on the sides, then my hopes will be realized.  If I see less scenery on the top, and/or bottom, then we've been crop dusted.",1521849600,6,3936,4.785822021116139

The team who worked on this made a fantastic series. CD's play high quality video (except the first 2-3 episodes which play a little blurred, but the rest are perfect.) note that when you buy the complete collection, you only get the CD's. you don't get the items that came with buying the individual seasons, like the small comic books, table of contents (yeah, its a guessing game to which episodes are on what disk), and just the nice packaging that was found in the individual seasons. But, this is cheaper, and gives you all the episodes in one convenient box.",1521763200,,712,4.6141732283464565

There are a lot of visual artifacts that show up upon viewing.  There are no captions for the episodes, even though the digital versions have full captioning. The only chapter division is between episodes, so there are no options to jump between acts within an episode or even to skip the title sequence. To top it all off, the sound levels are way too low.

I mostly just wanted to show this to my kids as one by one they came of age to appreciate it, and with Prime viewing gone this was the best remaining option.  And maybe that was the point.  But it's disappointing that this is the best treatment Nickelodeon has seen fit to give what is probably its crowning achievement.",1521417600,,807,4.346666666666667

How surprised I was to discover that I looked forward to each episode!  We ended up watching the whole series and loved it.  It's filled with great teaching moments for children as they learn that not everyone is perfect, good people make bad mistakes, and though some people cannot be helped there are those who can even when they appear to be beyond redemption.  And of course, it's a great adventure (with very realistic martial arts movements for those of us who pay attention to details like that).

The show is fantastic, one of my favs, however I am disappointed that this show has yet to be realeased on blu ray. Korra has a blu ray edition so why not this? Nickelodeon should know that the fans are in desperate need of the blu ray. Also they ditched the original cover art which was so much more dynamic and interesting to look at. Now its really flat, unoriginal, and the art style looks kinda of silly. Not really sure of the motivation behind this decision, they couldve kept it the same.

7338133,5,B011MUA592,"I would like to say, this is, by far, one of the BEST shows that Nickelodeon ever came out with.  I watched it when it was first released.  A lot of reviewers are saying the first couple of episodes are poor quality.  Yes that is true, but it was like that when it was originally released.  Mike and Bryan did the pilot episode along with the first 2 episodes.  When they got signed on for a season, that's when the better quality episodes started (episode 3, book 1)

Now please don't be deterred from this.  This is an AWESOME, unique, and beautiful series!  It's worth owning.  This will be my second complete set purchased; I purchased all of them when they were originally released.

If you want something completely new, well done, and has a rich fan base, this is your new binge watch!  Believe me, you will NOT want to stop watching.  It has drama, comedy, clever puns, and an underlying plot that grabs you and literally makes you love the main characters; and abhor the villain.  You will NOT be disappointed!",1517788800,,1019,4.502732240437158

Below is my original comment on the DVD:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you Ashley for the screenshots of the bad image quality. This applies to the first disc of season 1 (episodes 101 to 104 and the Kung Fu featurette). The other discs are ok.

Im dismayed by the lack of subtitles. If I hadnt turned on subtitles on Prime (I watched when it was free for members), I would have missed one of the most important scenes in the series. The voice of the lion turtle in episode 319 is so low that I would have missed the crucial spiritual insight that completes Aangs development. That theme is reprised multiple times in The Legend of Korra. You can google a transcript to get the text.

Of course the content is great. Along with Korra, this is my favorite animated series.",1517702400,8,1085,5.2298850574712645

7338149,4,B011MUA592,The disc set was affordable and arrived in a timely manner. I'm VERY pleased to finally own the entire series for one of my favorite anime shows of all time. My only complaint would be that some of the episodes were improperly transferred to video format. Somewhere right around the middle of the Book of Water the episodes get a sort of double image effect. It's pretty brief though and only effects a few episodes.,1517356800,,416,4.56

I had been looking for a way to watch Avatar again, as it was a happy memorable part of my childhood (granted Im 19). I found this DVD set and I couldn't be happier!

The downsides (for those of you who are picky):
There is commercials on here on the beginning of the DVD from old Nickelodeon, which means that this is an exact copy of what Nickelodeon had on tv.  The casss are awesome! And the discs are the same as the old ones, as Im told.

I didn't expect it to be the best quality, but I would have appreciated it to be packaged in more than a manila envelope and beaten up before it got to me. The inside/discs are undamaged, I submitted a ""poorly packaged"" review to amazon, and it's not worth the hassle of returning when the disks are fine. It's just a bit annoying to see the bent/battered box set on my shelf.

7338360,4,B011MUA592,"First of all, if you're worried about how well or not the show has aged; don't be, after the series gets it bearings early in the first season it's every bit as good as many remember

On the technical side of things, like others have said, a few episodes have a weird blurriness to them, however this is strictly limited to the first disk of Book One (and a single episode of Book 2 oddly enough)

While some have complained about the 4:3 (full screen) formatting, that is the way the show was originally animated and intended to be seen and to crop it to 16:9 (widescreen) would mean loosing important footage off the top and bottom. And ultimately it can be achieved with the settings on most players anyway

And although some people have mentioned missing episodes in books 2 and 3, the set I received was missing none, and while I can't account for manufacturing errors, this may have been a mistake on their part as the episode selection screens have two pages in those seasons, but won't switch to the next automatically if watching one at a time

Overall, I definitely believe this is worth the purchase, however it is ultimately a repackaging of existing volume DVDs, so it is not an upgrade from them if you already own those",1509580800,,1234,4.520179372197309

 Nice packaging. I haven't watched any of the special features yet, but the videos themselves are great. My only complaint is that the chapter skips go to the next episode.

My only minor complaint is the first couple episodes are a bit blurry. However, the rest are the quality we had when we were kids, which is great and all that you can expect! Plus, each DVD has special features that are incredibly nerdy, funny, and fun things to know.

I bought this in hopes of having a complete collection on a physical format. Sadly this is product is not what this show deserves. For one, its very apparent that these discs are just from the original run of the show as it still shows commercials from around that time, like a Series Of Unfortunate events.

 But whatever, I want the series not the ads. First season is great, no flaws in the transfer. Season two is where the issues come up. The first episode is fine, and so is episode 2 until the end of the episode when it freezes. Then the next episode doesn't work at all. I stopped watching the show, and sent it back. I also hear that season 3 was missing episodes, so this is obviously a bad collection and this wasn't just my copy.

It almost looks like the ringing you get when you have sharpness set all the way up. I even tried it in two different brand bluray players and my legacy OPPO DVD player (at the time a very expensive upconverting DVD player). Imagine my surprise to discover it wasn't my equipment at all but the video itself! My second though was we must have received a faulty disc but a quick look at the reviews here and elsewhere on the internet show that this is a known issue... This is actually the way it looks off the disc! I checked the box and this DVD box set was released in 2015- how did Viacom think this was acceptable in 2015?! I know it's a kids show but the image is so bad, particularly with motion around the characters eyes and mouths, that it gives you a headache trying to focus on it.

7338577,4,B011MUA592,"This show is amazing.  Flat-out awesome.  As the characters grow and develop during the run of the plot, it makes for one of the best children's shows of the 2000's (considered a dark age in the genre of American cartoons) and is pretty enjoyable for all ages.  The first half of Book 1 really drags a bit (noticed this after my second trek through the series), but is necessary due to the world building/framing.  After that, the series goes up, up, and up from there and never comes down.

As far as this Complete Series boxset is concerned.....it's pretty much the three individual seasons/books releases (2006, 2007, 2008) with less impressive concept art and a simple compact boxset to hold all three together.  Visually, it's an unimpressive casing compared to simply buying all three seasons separately.  Beyond this superficial comment, the *real* downside to the quality of this set (and the individual set editions before it) is that Book 1: Water, Disc 1 has AWFUL image quality/display properties.  You heard me right, if you are having this problem, your copy isn't bad.....they all are.  All animation stills are blurry with a choppy quality that seems to be the result of a terrible digital scan during creation.  Again, the problem is....it's on ALL copies of this show's release and they are bad from the ""production factory"" core.  There is no avoiding it and frankly, the only way you are going to get a better quality picture, is to find one of the many illegal cartoon streaming sites that has the show in 1080p image quality.  Hopefully when and if Nickelodeon releases this show to BluRay, they resolve this problem instead of shamelessly just repackaging like they have the past two or three release editions.
What's unfathomable to me is that the quality was not fixed between Book 1's original 2006 boxset release and this Complete Collection in 2015.  It's deplorable.  A sorry state indeed.",1493424000,29,1918,4.897832817337461

If I'm buying a Blu-ray, I'm expecting the show is reformatted.
Just get the DVD set... It's cheaper and it's probably the same image and sound quality.",1535500800,,301,4.69811320754717
