6163583,2,B00HHITD60,"I've been using Lindsay Brin's postpartum boot camp DVD, and saw this one on a daily deal site recently. I like the intensity level of the boot camp DVD but have been frustrated with it because it is very high impact, which means that there are a lot of segments that I either can't do at all or need to modify heavily due to having had knee surgery several years ago (my knees are in great shape now, but I was warned that I need to take good care of them from here on out). One of the previous reviewers had mentioned that this one did not have as much jumping, so I thought it would be a good option for me. Unfortunately, I couldn't even make it through the warm-up, as it was very heavy on the squats and plies. I can only conclude that for some reason, Lindsay Brin really hates knees. I am glad I didn't pay full price for this and will probably be reselling it. I am still looking for an exercise DVD that is challenging, time-efficient for a busy mom, offers some variety, and won't undo all of my orthopedic surgeon's hard work. If you have found one that fits this description, please comment and let me know.",1395705600,12,1120,4.238317757009346
6163584,4,B00HHITD60,"I love this workout.  I definitely recommend it.  It is safe for post partum, well researched and effective.  I use all MIF videos.  I don't rate this one quite as high because there aren't great low impact options.  I need to modify some exercises because of pelvic floor issues.  Even the beginner options include jumping which isn't great for me at this point.  But with my own modifications I still love this video and I enjoy spending my free time with Lindsay!  That says a lot because I don't have much of that!",1395360000,,518,4.494623655913978
6163585,5,B00HHITD60,"Loving the style of this DVD - quick and feeling stronger just after 4 weeks of use.  I like the support you get with the DVD using the MIF app.  It tailors a workout schedule for you (if you're clueless as where to begin, like me) - changing it up daily/weekly to keep the boredom at bay (it only has 4 or 5 day/ week schedules which I can't seem to find tme for).

This workout does seem to be heavy on the knees (lunges, squats, curtsies).  (Read: I've never had knee problems, but felt that the hormones or something during pregnancy did weaken one of them....hoping this workout doesn't ""do it in"" but helps me slowly strengthen...for now it's highlighting a possible knee injury).",1395273600,,686,4.464
6163586,5,B00HHITD60,"I am a big fan of Lindsay Brin's other videos, and used her Post Natal Bootcamp video to lose the baby weight after my first child.  While I really like the Post-Natal Bootcamp (once you get past the cheesiness of it) this video is a definite improvement over it.  I've done four or five of the 10 minute interval segments so far and they are definitely challenging.  This video is not for wimps.  BUT there are also modifications to help you ramp up.  I would highly recommend this video to anyone looking to tone up and lose the baby weight.  I can see myself doing this video for years to come, and in fact it may replace Post Natal Boot Camp as my go to video because she doesn't say 1,000 times ""If you just had that baby...""  I also prefer it over the Post Natal Bootcamp because its less dependent on jumping based exercises, which if you did just have a baby, or have one napping in the house, is problematic.",1394582400,11,917,4.296511627906977
6163587,5,B00HHITD60,"I am an avid exerciser. I have 5 kids and little time, so I like HIIT, Tabata and other forms of exercise that pack it in. I enjoy Lindsey's Pretty Fierce, I have Bootcamp 2, and I really, really like the quick and to the point format. Little time? Do one or two. More time? Do more. Some body parts are sore? Tailor the workout to your needs! Ah, awesome! However, I have a back inflammation that I need to work around so I need a lot of variety as I can't do all types of exercise. I am always on the lookout for new cardio programs and I got a free trial through MIF of the core 1, the HIIT and something else on the DVD. Well, I fell in love with the HIIT! I also like the Core 1 as I had diastasis recti and I need to keep my transverse nice and tight :) So, I ordered the DVD and I am SUPER pleased! The four toning segments, plus the upper body and lower body ones are nice, nice, nice. I enjoy doing them and I FEEL them, so that's good. They aren't the same old routines  The HIIT, the Sports cardio and the core cardio are also awesome! I haven'd done more core segments due to my back issues but I can so easily substitute a 30 or 40 seconds exercise from one of the segments and do it instead of the ones I can't do! I just LOVE this DVD. I can work on 2 segments or 4, and have so much fun that the pain feels good :) I highly recommend it.",1394496000,10,1353,3.866906474820144

As a mom of 4 kiddos under 5 yrs old I am pretty busy, so I appreciate the quick and challenging workouts.  I can't tell you how many times people say ""you have 4 kids??"" it is all because of MIF.

6163590,5,B00HHITD60,"I actually ordered this dvd on sale in December for $9.99 thinking that it would be easier than Lindsay's other workouts (I have all of Lindsay's previous workouts including her Superfit and Pretty Fierce series but wanted this dvd to have in my ""collection"").  I decided to try it out today just to see what it is like but figured I would likely stick with the Pretty Fierce or Superfit workouts for now since this is postnatal and my little guy is almost 3 BUT was surprised and challenged.  These workouts are great.  I loved the first Post Natal Boot Camp workouts because they are only 10 minutes and I would usually pick 2-3 workouts and be done and still have gotten in an awesome workout.  This dvd is quite similar, maybe even a little harder.  It went by really fast since it is only 10 minute segments and you choose what you want.  So I am going to incorporate this into my regular workout schedule.  Great dvd and great price!! :)",1390089600,25,943,4.4476744186046515

6163592,5,B00HHITD60,"This is an AWESOME routine. While it's been awhile since my kids were born, when I mentioned to someone that I was looking for a good workout for diastasis recti, this was recommended. The workouts are just challenging enough to push me, but not so difficult that I collapse in exhaustion or pain as you do with some others. There's a very clear progression laid out for people at all levels. I have never stayed with any one video/program this long. I really appreciate the structure of the program.",1517616000,2,500,4.629213483146067

6163599,2,B00HHITD60,"Okay, so two stars isn't really fair at this point because I haven't tried the workout yet since I'm still pregnant. BUT, I wanted to take a good look at it now to prepare myself, and I couldn't find the calendars (mentioned in the product info and the back of the DVD). They weren't in the DVD sleeve, on the product page, on the Moms into Fitness website, and when googling 'Postnatal SlimDown' there's a page on Lindsay Brin's website that promises a Postnatal SlimDown workout calendar download if you hand over your info and sign up for her newsletter. Guess what? That's not the calendar for the DVD. So now I'm getting a newsletter and being asked to sign up for a subscription workout video service when I already paid money for a DVD. Awesome.

I am following the calendar and doing the workouts in the order Lindsay recommends, and it helps keep me motivated and working out regularly. Thank you so much, Lindsay Brin!",1507420800,,450,4.357142857142857

6163604,5,B00HHITD60,"Love it! It really helped me feel stronger after my second baby. I started about 2 and a half months post partum and lost about 10 pounds with it.
I recommend it!",1501027200,,162,4.09375
6163605,4,B00HHITD60,"Okay so I wanted to wait a bit and get into it before I posted a review - so when I'm more months into it I may post another one. Here are the things I really like about it.

Lindsay is fun to watch, adorable and easy to follow - and her notes on form and her attitude make it easy to get into without getting intimidated or overwhelmed.

I started 6 weeks post-partum - actually correction, I tried to start 4 weeks in but I was still bleeding a lot and not quite feeling there, so I waited another couple weeks and that helped a lot. I'm just determined to get back into shape quicker than with my first baby. This is my second post-partum, and I'm starting from a belly that's still left over from before a bit and then added stretch from this most recent pregnancy - I'm inspired to think my belly even has the possibility to look like Lindsay's one day--even before pregnancy my belly's always been my toughest spot to tackle.

So I really like the core stuff - the total workouts so far. I also started out sort of doing it wrong because I just went through all the sections in a row and then realized that's not how you do it! So just a tip - use the app and follow the calendar because the calendar tells you what workouts to do - you'll see. Then you mark them off once you're done. Also it takes me a bit of lag to go from one section to another on the dvd - but it's ok because I don't mind the couple seconds of rest.

Anyway, so again I'll post later when results may be more obvious but here are my thoughts. So far I don't see this workout being truly effective in slimming you down on its own unless you go with a good (breastfeeding-safe) diet to go with it - and then I think you may still need to add a little more cardio to your daily life. I could be wrong - but it seems that way. Second, so far the core stuff seems to really be helping me feel stronger in my mid-section - thus less back pain - like if you carry your baby. I tend to look at myself after the workout in the mirror and immediately feel a little deflated that I don't look like Lindsay (yet lol) but I hope to get closer one day.

And final thought is - I like that she really gives a good understanding of Diastasis Recti - and explains what to avoid if you have it. My only hope is that mine gets better and heals more with time and doing the exercises that are okay to do so far.",1498780800,3,2371,4.025477707006369
6163606,3,B00HHITD60,"3 1/2 stars.  I waited a while to write this to see if I changed my mind.  I feel a need to explain:

Once, not too long ago, I was in great shape and did very strenuous workouts.  Some even called me addicted to exercise, which I was for a few years.  Then I got way out of shape....so far gone that I purchased this dvd made for post-partum (when i was post-partum, I wasn't even close to as bad as recently).

This workout is broken into convenient sections.  I stuck with the easiest section for abs only for well over a month.  The goal was to strengthen the TA - nothing more!  The only thing I didn't like about that section was the breathing deep breathing moved too fast- would have been more effective to slow it down, but no biggie- she still gets 5 stars for that first section (10 min)!!!  My TA did get firm again and it's the easiest core work ever- honestly feels more like a relaxation exercise than a workout!

The second section for abs wasn't as fun and effective, so I only used it twice - 3 stars.  I didn't like the exercises for other parts of the body (the bulk of the dvd) at all - 1 star.

 I purchased Tracy Mallett's Belly Blaster and the EXACT exercises were on her dvd and even a cute little line about keeping the butt ""loosey-goosey"" (hmm).  The more advanced exercises were more fun on that dvd but that's another review.

As for Lindsay, she is bubbly and cute, easy to watch daily.  I do not regret buying this dvd just for that short little segment that I enjoyed.",1497398400,3,1501,4.22887323943662
6163607,5,B00HHITD60,"This is a great exercise DVD for those with diastasis recti or for anyone just wanting to get into shape. It comes with a link to a calendar so there is no guessing on what workout to do or when. There are modifications for beginners, intermediate and advance. A great, versatile DVD!",1496275200,,284,4.480769230769231
6163608,3,B00HHITD60,"Lindsay is an excellent trainer. The design of the workouts is amazing, in that you can fit in a quick workout while caring for a baby. I didn't have diastasis recti, but I really liked Core 1 ""Recovery"", it helped get some core functionality back. That all being said, I could not get myself excited to do these workouts. For whatever reason, I didn't connect to them. One of the bigger problems I had was easing into the cardio. I had some stress incontinence for the first few months postpartum (and still do a little), and Cardio 1, the Ali jumps...not great. I got Jillian Michaels' Hot Body, Healthy Mommy, and it was amazing and I found myself wanting to do those workouts (you break a sweat, only one move that involves jumping and she has a modifier that removes the impact). Good workouts here, and considering all the other glowing reviews, I'm definitely not the norm in not loving these.",1496188800,2,900,4.596273291925466
6163609,5,B00HHITD60,This is the perfect workout DVD to get back into shape after baby. I'm 7 months post partum and haven't worked out in forever. These exercises are a gentle enough to get back to where you need to be but they can kick your butt into shape as well.,1492819200,,246,4.040816326530612
6163610,5,B00HHITD60,Great workout for postpartum women. I love how flexible it is. You can mix and match your workout and it can be as little as ten minutes and still be effective. It's one of my favorites.,1491004800,,186,4.194444444444445
6163611,5,B00HHITD60,"I started this workout series when my second baby was 4 months old, and it was exactly what I needed. I strongly recommend downloading the app for iPhone or iPad, or at least getting the PDF workout schedule emailed to you. It's like having a personal trainer--Lindsay will get you back into shape, at a pace that is appropriate for a new mom, without you having to expend mental effort figuring out which workout to do when. Best of all, she manages to pack in entire workouts in 30-40 minutes. You just need to carve out the time each day, and she will make sure you get the right balance of cardio, strength training, and flexibility. Best of all, my core and back strength are better than ever. At 35, these workouts have resolved back issues I've had since a car accident I had in college. After finishing Postnatal, I went on to do the Pretty Fierce Weight Loss series, and now I'm doing the Lean Out series. I'm totally addicted, lost 14 pounds (5# under my pre-pregnancy weight), and in the best shape of my life!",1489536000,3,1021,4.46524064171123

I just discovered her postnatal DVD's after the birth of my second son, and I'm absolutely in love!! As someone who used to spend hours a day working out before having kids, including running 3-5 miles most days, I've really struggled with my postpartum body and getting it back into shape after having my babies. I've also struggled being able to find DVD's that are challenging enough to do from home that also addressed my separated abs (Diastasis Recti). With a 20 month old and 4 month old I just don't have time to make it to the gym any more or go for decent runs. This DVD has a ton of mix and match options for a short workout or longer one depending on my time (And how much sleep I got last night!). Her workouts are always challenging and mix it up so your muscles never memorize a move and are constantly being toned and strengthen. Her cardio segments are really challenging too, mixing in a lot of new and fun aerobic and kickboxing moves which is so much fun! She also has amazing core and full body workouts as well as modifications for new moms who may have Diastasts Recti like myself, and have to take it slow.

6163617,4,B00HHITD60,This is a well designed program for anyone looking to gradually get back into shape. It is designed for post partom but I believe anyone could benefit from this program if the needed to ease into exercising. There are downloadable calanders for whichever program you choose that can link right to the calander in your phone (for my iPhone anyway - not sure about androids but possibly) which is great to help remind you which workouts to do that day. The workouts are varied not target every part of your body and really do the job!! I'm deducting a star for the tribal background music that doesn't match the rhythm of the workouts - it's quite distracting so I turn the sound down. Also for the lack of enthusiasm the background ladies show -near from motivational. All in all its a great program!,1480636800,,799,4.594405594405594

With my first child, I bought one of Lindsay's other DVDs but this one has a wide array of workout routines. After having a baby my body definitely looked different, but after a month of exercising I began to see the slight emergence of a 6-pack! Each segment is no more than 10 minutes long which is very convenient when you have an infant and toddler. Sometimes I can get through 3 segments and sometimes only one, but that is ok. You can do each phase for 3-4 months so it is really worth the money. Leaving the house to go to the gym is just not realistic, since I am a stay-at-home mom, but with this video I can fit it into any time of the day.

The DVD referenced it on the cover, but came with no information as to how to get the workout schedule. I e-mailed the customer service address and they provided it to me via e-mail which was nice.

6163626,5,B00HHITD60,"***Updated with BEFORE/AFTER photos**

This DVD set provides a variety of exercises that strengthen and tone not only the core, but the full body.  After my third pregnancy, I was left with the ""mom pooch,"" or diastasis recti.  None of the exercises I was doing were helping; in fact, many of them were making it worse.  Thanks to Lindsay, I lost 20 lbs and I have a flat tummy again!

The calendar is customizable for all fitness levels and number of days you want to work out each week.  She emphasizes building up your muscle strength, particularly in repairing the core, before moving onto more challenging exercises. Each set is around 8-10 minutes and they are combined in a specific order on the calendar to increase intensity when your body is ready.  She also empathizes with the fact that we may not have gotten much sleep the night before, so she keeps the exercises short and sweet, yet effective.

My doctor confirmed that the ""3 finger gap"" between my stomach muscles was repaired after completing this program! I am more confident and have much more energy!",1465862400,154,1072,4.725806451612903

6163629,5,B00HHITD60,"the workouts are perfect for post baby. they are challenging but do-able and the focus on breathing really helps. The core exercises are great. I had no idea of what your inner core was until watching this. I've had great results so far, just 3 weeks in. I don't weigh myself often, but my clothes are loose and my energy level is up! This program does start out very slow, which is perfect for me considering i had an emergency c section with my incision getting infected one week after giving birth and my soon is currently 7 months old. Definitely recommend this to anyone who just had a baby, regardless of the circumstances.",1463529600,2,629,4.526315789473684
6163630,4,B00HHITD60,"I was expecting 10 minute complete workouts for some reason.  The workouts are 10 minutes, but you're supposed to add on the warm up, abs and cool down/stretch portions.  This makes it at least a 20-26 minute workout.  My baby starts crying pretty quickly and naps are brief, so I can't finish a full workout on a regular basis. Plus, upper body strength work seems to contribute to me getting plugged ducts, unfortunately.

I do really like the first rehabilitative ab workout on this dvd.  I did that from about 5 weeks to 7/8 weeks postpartum.  I didn't have diastasis recti at my 6 week check up.

I'm currently just doing a babywearing workout routine I found online.  It's not the greatest, but at least I feel like I'm completing something.

She does have a bit of a raspy? voice, but it isn't unpleasant to me or anything.  I will possibly try this dvd again in the future when baby is more easily entertained for longer periods.",1463356800,7,937,4.5568862275449105
6163631,4,B00HHITD60,I enjoyed the workouts and love that they are broken up in 10 minute sections (important as a mom of 5 :) ) I think the only cons to these workouts was a little confusion on some of the workouts with D. recti and the music in some of the workouts (the drums were a bit annoying and I kinda felt like I was on a viking rowing boat....),1462665600,8,334,3.8550724637681157

6163633,5,B00HHITD60,"I purchased this DVD about a year ago, and I am finally getting around to using it. I love that the workouts are broken down into different sections and are short and to the point. Some days I just do total body workouts, some days the tummy toning workouts and other days when I have more time both. They are each only about 7-10 minutes so you don't get bored but still feel like you had a good workout. With 3 kids and a full time job that helps! Also, I have diastasis recti from having twins and she lets you know during the video when not to do the exercise or has an alternative workout for those with this. Love it!",1461628800,,623,4.114754098360656

I purchased some other postnatal DVD's after my second child that were much harder. I've now had 3 kids and this was just what I needed to get back into shape. Also,  you need two sets of hand weights...no more than 10lbs.",1459814400,,346,4.323076923076923
6163635,5,B00HHITD60,"I've only done this workout once, but I'm already loving it! It's just enough cardio to get your heart rate up and fat burning, but enough of a recovery to NOT hate it.  I hate cardio with a passion and generally stick to Pilates.  But I was researching ways to help heal diastis recti, and this came up.  She actually has someone in the workout modify the exercises for this exact purpose! And she very clearly states if you have diastis recti, to refrain completely from certain exercises. I love this! I feel like I finally found someone who gets it!  She's not obnoxious either, which is kind of important if you're going to be watching this over and over routinely. I've had two children (both were huge babies) via c section.  My abdominal wall since my second delivery has just plain given up lol so I started researching ways to pull those muscles back together again.  I have a 4 finger wide gap...hoping continual use will help close that gap for good!!! I'll try to update as I get results!

The only thing I wish this dvd had was a programmable playlist.  You have to manually select sections after each one ends.  That's kind of a waste of time but overall is just annoying, not a complete deterrent.",1459209600,7,1213,4.502283105022831

I recommend this to anyone who wants to get back to working out after having a baby... in fact i recommended it to a few others who did not have children yet, and after they tried it, they said they used muscles they didn't know they even had... :p before i started this workout, after a few months postnatal, i had a gap of 2 1/2 inches, i got to 1/2 inch after a few wks of the workout... I'm very satisfied with this workout.. i do recommend doing the live streaming, its worth the money!",1457308800,2,530,4.155339805825243

Her modifications for making things easier or more advanced are great and let you take it to whatever level you are at, and it is really geared to let you push yourself. I loved having the calendar to know how to progress and it helped motivate me. I started shortly after 6 weeks postpartum and completed the entire series, and then have moved on to her Pretty Fierce series. She does a great job of providing real life workouts along with nutrition advice perfect for moms! I loved the breastfeeding bonuses as well.",1457136000,,669,4.491803278688525

Others actually worsened the separation between my abs, and coming back to Lindsay's workout brought them right back where they're supposed to be.  I had diastasis recti for years after my first child, and I credit doing this workout in preventing the condition from coming back.

The fact that a plan is laid us for me is great and it comes in 3 different phases depending on our activity/energy level. I really love the fact that the workouts are in 10 min or less segments so that if our babies get fussy or need attention or we just want to spread out our workouts we can and it doesnt interrupt the flow of the workouts. Plus, lindsay is very easy to watch so I am not annoyed at watching the video so I don't get sick of playing it which means I actually stick to the plan!! Oh yah! And the fact that the abs focus on postnatal exercises is great because without guidance I would never do these exercises and without her information I would have never know about abdominal stretching...even my obgyn didn't mention it!!",1455667200,,808,4.287581699346405

I love that Lindsay does a preview of the next moves while you are in the recovery portion! It makes it so much easier to focus on good form while you are exercising when you don't have to look directly at the TV to figure out what comes next.
I love that it isn't written just for the first time you do the video.
I love that there are easy variations to change the intensity of the exercises.
I love that the repetitions are timed and balanced so I don't get hung up on uneven counts.
I love her attitude and encouraging personality.",1447113600,,554,4.186915887850467
6163650,4,B00HHITD60,"I've been doing this video about 3-4 times a week for last month. I am still on phase 1 workouts, and I cannot imagine how hard phase 2 workouts will be, this kicks my butt! I haven't gone to the website for the calendar stuff yet.

What I like most is she gives good guidance on proper form, and reminds you to take this at your own pace. I also like the selection of total body workouts, fat burning/cardio and core workouts. And they aren't too long, because mom's don't get a lot of free time to do this, efficient and effective workouts.

I consider myself a moderate exerciser. It was easier to get my figure back after my first baby, and I ran my first 5K when he was one. However, my second pregnancy was with twins, and harder on me, and is taking me longer to get back in shape. I can see if you're new to exercise, or it's been years, this video can feel self defeating with these hard-core, super conditioned girls on the screen, even though she reminds you to take it at your own pace. I would also recommend Erin O'Brien postnatal workout video. It is a more gentle workout, and she's sympathetic to your condition.

I like that these workouts are short and sweet, and Lindsay is down to earth and not annoying like other exercise videos, and the music isn't obnoxious either.",1447027200,3,1290,4.366666666666666

6163652,5,B00HHITD60,"I've done a few of Lindsay's DVDs over the past few years, I like her style, but some are better than others. This one is a winner. It has almost the diversity of her first Bootcamp (which has a fantastic range of 10 minute sessions that kept me interested for months and has its calendar built in, meaning you pick week 1 or week 10 and it runs three or four sessions automatically - whereas for this one you print off the calendar from her website). That really works for me: if my knee is bothering me, I can skip the cardio and swap in something else, or if I'm feeling ambitious I can do an extra core workout, just 6 or 8 minutes. And the phase 2 flexibility cool-down is very satisfying (I'm not remotely flexible, it does me good).

I'm pretty much done with it now - and definitely fitter for it - but I'm still using it as an add-on: I'm doing her new 30-day core, which consists of about 30 minutes in one session daily, but I am adding in an extra ten minutes plus the cool down from Postnatal SlimDown. The kids have scratched the DVD horribly, some of it won't play properly, and I'm seriously considering buying a replacement.",1445904000,,1141,4.306976744186047

I feel stronger and it's help with the care of a newborn. I'm alone M-F and I still make sure to do my workouts, I skip cleaning some days tho!! I think combining this with walking is a good idea.

6163663,5,B00HHITD60,"My fav Lindsay Brin workout video since I can watch the clock tick down and it's not so much up and down (aerobic standing then down to floor etc) as her other tapes.  The only thing I don't like is all the squatting (probably just because I feel like I can't do them right - hard for me not to have my knees go over toes). I wish they had some sets already paired together instead of choosing the next one from menu after doing one (have to grab remote etc).  10 minute workouts or less which is great for when baby doesn't give you much time.

I don't do any diet since I am breastfeeding so I was surprised to see that I lost weight that fast. BUT boy do I sweat when I do this! I was used to Jillian Michaels DVD before but Lindsay really focus on the fact that we are moms and she knows what we need!

It was clear that breastfeeding alone was not going to do it this time around. I needed something fast since I have a toddler as well. I started it at 8 weeks postpartum and in 2 weeks lost 5 pounds and 2 inches off my waist without changing my diet. The workout is challenging but doable for me even though I did no exercise my last 2 months of pregnancy. Lindsay is very upbeat and motivating. She makes me smile while making me sweat. Not easy since I abhor exercise. Her core exercises are great at helping that mommy tummy we all get! I also love her website and all the motivational and educational content she emails out if you sign up. :-),1434758400,10,757,4.227586206896552
6163670,5,B00HHITD60,"So far I am enjoying this dvd. I love how she has different levels of abdominal work. I have diastasis recti and need to start from scratch with strengthening my abs. I hope this dvd helps with that.

6163671,5,B00HHITD60,"I started this dvd at exactly 6-weeks post-partum. Prior to being pregnant, I exercised 3-5 times a week. Mostly cardio and free-weights with occasional yoga for strength. I tried to exercise during my pregnancy by walking and using pre-natal exercise dvds but was only able to sporadically exercise in the second and third trimester due to numerous illnesses (thanks to a kid in daycare!). I gained about 45 pounds this pregnancy and lost about 20 lbs just after the baby was born. By the time I hit 6 weeks, I had hit a plateau with regard to weight loss. In comes the wonderful Lindsay Brin...

I downloaded the calendars from the website and used the app to track my progress. BEWARE...the pdf calendar sometimes lists different workouts than the app (on both Android and iOS platforms). I contacted Mom's Into Fitness about this and they said they would let their app developer know. They instructed me to follow the pdf workouts. I mention this just in case anyone else is confused. As I was regularly exercising before my pregnancy, I felt that I could try the Advanced workout plan and back off to beginner if needed. The fact that you can choose the level you start at is great, just wish there was more guidance on what constitutes ""Advanced"" vs. ""Beginner."" I began the Advanced workout series and followed the schedule as laid out in the calendar. I even took the two days each week of ""rest"" as listed on the calendar even though I really wanted to keep going.

Most workouts were between 30-37 minutes. The longest was 45 minutes and I believe that only happened once in Phase 1. Phase 1 (3 weeks long) consists of core work and interval workouts with periods of active recovery between exercises. When I began, I tended to follow Amy (beginner) and Lindsay (intermediate/advanced). I used 5 and 8 lb weights. During my first week, I was definitely breathing hard and not really able to keep up with the pace of the ladies on the screen. That doesn't matter though. Lindsay repeatedly tells you to go at your own pace and you will improve over time. I can attest that this is true! By the end of Phase 1, I was not only keeping up with Michele (advanced), but I was actually going faster than her on many of the exercises!  As recommended by Lindsay, I took my measurements at the beginning of the program and again at the end of Phase 1 (3 weeks after starting). Here's my progress (all measurements are in inches; Google ""Lindsay Brin how to take measurements"" for a video of Lindsay showing you where to measure):

Arm: -0.25
Neck: -0.25
Chest: -1.5
Waist: -1.5
Below waist: -1.25
Hips: -2.25
Thigh: -1
Calf: 0

A total of 8 inches in 3 weeks!

In addition to these changes, I have lost 6 pounds!  I am now within 10 pounds of my pre-pregnancy weight and have Lindsay to thank for it. I started Phase 2 of the workout plan this week and am excited to blast off those remaining pounds. I'll be sure to update when I am fully done with the program.

Pros:
- Pre-designed workout schedules customized to Advanced or Beginner (4 days a week and 5 days a week)
- Workouts are short. You get a lot done in a little bit of time.
- Lindsay gives excellent cues and is likeable (no unnecessary chatter). She often reminds you to tighten your core and emphasizes good form.
- Workouts are all time-based intervals. You do as much as you can during each interval, going at your own pace.
- Core exercises specifically designed with post-partum moms in mind. There is a strong focus on strengthening your inner core before moving on to more traditional ab exercises. Exercises are also customized for those with diastasis recti (the dvd shows you how to test for this).
- Lindsay is a MOM. She has 3 kids and knows what it takes to get your body back while having to care for little ones. I find this makes her more relatable than other instructors.

Cons:
- Many be hard on the knees for some. Lots of squats, lunges, and jumps.
- Although Lindsay keeps telling you to go at your own pace (and says that they all are going that their own pace), more often than not, Lindsay, Amy, and Michele are perfectly synchronized. I had to laugh about this during Total Body 4, when Lindsay emphasizes that they are going at difference paces yet they are all perfectly in-sync.
- Moms Into Fitness app is sometimes glitchy and doesn't have the best interface.
- Sometimes Lindsay will give you ""homework"" where she will give you an exercise to do on your own for ""as many reps as possible.""  I didn't mind that in Phase 1 but now that I am in 3 weeks into Phase 2, I am starting to get annoyed by it, especially in Upper and Core 4. These are my least favorite segments and I do not want to do even more of them.

Overall, the pros outweigh the small number of cons. I highly recommend this DVD for those moms. There is enough variety to keep you interested and you will be amazed at how strong you will feel.

Sept 2015 Update:
Okay, I've now finished Phase 2. I had to take a 3 week hiatus midway through Week 10 due to mastitis and moving to another state so I did not finish in August as I'd planned. I re-started week 10 and finished the plan. Below are my changes from Phase 1 to 2 along with my overall losses in parentheses.

Arm: -0.25 (-.5)
Neck: -0.75 (1)
Chest: -2.75 (-4.25)
Waist: -2.5 (4)
Below waist: -3.5 (-4.75)
Hips: -1.75 (4)
Thigh: -2 (-3)
Calf: 0 (0) - no room to lose!

A total of 41.7 inches and 20.2 pounds lost from start to finish! I am now 7 pounds under my pre-pregnancy weight and feeling great. I did this all by following Lindsay's exercise plan and eating healthy. This means eating real (i.e., not overly processed) foods, drinking a lot of water, having a fruit or vegetable at every meal and snack, and tracking my exercise and dietary intake using the MyFitnessPal app.

So, what's next? According to the Moms into Fitness website, your child should be at least 6 months old before starting the Pretty Fierce workout programs. My child turns 5 months tomorrow so I will have to wait a month. In the meantime, I will alternate Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred and Killer Buns and Thighs dvds. I've read that others have found this to be a great combo. After that, it is back to Moms into Fitness. Thank you, Lindsay Brin!",1434412800,55,6250,4.465381244522349

6163675,5,B00HHITD60,"I love Lindsay Brin's workouts. I got this DVD for my second baby. I exercised 3 times a week consistently after I was given the ok by the doctor ( 6 weeks postpartum). I gained 36 pounds in my pregnancy and have lost 26 pounds in 3 months. I would have probably lost all the weight if I had exercised 4 or 5 times a week, but I am taking it at my own pace.  Also I had a separation on my abdominal of almost 3 fingers and now it is healed. I combined this DVD with the cfs method for the core and worked perfectly. With my first pregnancy I gained almost 50 pounds and lost everything by 6 months. I also used Lindsay Brin DVD , but the postnatal boot camp 1 and 2.

I am 8mo pp, almost 100% back in physical shape and have been for a long time at my pre-preg weight, and I am still enjoying and eagerly doing these workouts! First of all, they are tough, both phase I and phase II workouts kick my butt every time. Second, they never bore me, and normally I get so bored so quickly with workout dvds. I don't know why this one doesn't bore me, I like that it is simple, no frills, no stupid ""look at you go girl friend"" fake talk- just a good workout with straight forward instructions and enough variety to challenge my body and keep me interested. This is probably the best $10 I have ever spent in terms of fitness. Pre-preg I ran, did Les Mills at the gym, and did Insanity at home- so this dvd is definitely for anyone who was in great shape pre-preg and during preg. If she made more dvds like this with new workouts I would happily buy them all. Cannot recommend this enough for someone looking for a challenge even when they are back in shape. Also since there are so many different workouts you can mix and match and stay motivated and ""un-bored"".",1431648000,3,1119,4.283018867924528

The workouts are conveniently separated into 10 minute sections so you can do the chosen set all at once or pause in between sections to take care of the kids if you need to. Also it allows you the flexibility to do a longer workout or a shorter work out each day depending on how you feel. Since each 10 minute section has multiple exercises that last 1-2 minutes each, the variety makes the 10 minute section seem to go by very quickly. Lindsay is very instructive about the correct form for each workout as well as encouraging in her demeanor. The ladies on the dvd are also fully dressed with shirts and pants or capris for all workouts except the core workouts in which they still have pants or capris but only have a sports bra on.

I began this program at 4 weeks postpartum and found the first few weeks extremely challenging, but at the same time felt like they were designed to meet me where my fitness levels were post-delivery. I LOVED this workout series. I loved how the videos progressively became more challenging and how the various workouts were paired. I am extremely grateful for the emphasis on resistance training. I have always been one to focus on cardio, but know that I will gain so much more from my workouts by adding in strength and resistance training.

6163684,5,B00HHITD60,"This DVD is fantastic.  I had diastasis recti after my second pregnancy.  I researched postnatal dvd and movements to figure out the best way to workout again after delivery without worsening the problem.  This dvd shows you how to check if you have abdominal separation and then when you start the workouts it gives you modifications AT ALL LEVELS INCLUDING THE ADVANCED STAGES for this.  This way you can workout effectively without worrying about making the separations worse.  I don't understand some of the reviewers whom said they didn't use the dvd once they determined they had ab separation because the dvd clearly states modifications for when you have ab separation.  I feel the people whom said this didn't really start using the dvd.  These modifications are clearly mentioned at all levels.

The best part about including the modifications means that when I am able to take my little one to my gym (at 4 months) to take classes, I will know modifications for when the instructor does something I don't feel comfortable doing.  I had abdominal separation that was about 4-5 fingers wide and now its down to 1 finger at 6 weeks postpartum.  I have been using this dvd monday thru friday (30 to 37 minute workouts), tracey mallet's superfit mama book, erin o brien's postnatal rescue on the weekend (15 minute workouts).  I love the way I feel after the workouts as well.  I have been following Lindsay's calendar which you can get online after you buy the dvd to help you stay on track.  It works believe me!  Its so easy to get distracted postpartum.

The DVD is broken down into many different workouts.  At the Level 1 there is a 3minute warm up, 2 10 minute strengthening workouts, 2 10 minute cardio workouts, 3 ab workouts (which the first is perfect for people with abdominal separation and it really helps lessen it), and a cooldown  of 5 minutes.  There is also advanced workouts in the Level 2 that include HIIT cardio, Sport Cardio, a Core cardio workout, and 2 more total strengthening workouts.  This also includes are more intense upper strength workout and a lower strength workout.  There are 2 more abdominal workouts and a separate cool down in this section as well.

You can mix and match or follow her program.  It makes it fun as these progress so I haven't gotten bored yet, but I'm only at 6 weeks.  I think this is a wonderful dvd to use postpartum and love that I can workout confident that I'm not worsening any abdominal separation.  I wish I had this during my first pregnancy because I feel more fit at this stage and am losing the baby weight faster after this pregnancy ALREADY compared to my first pregnancy.",1426723200,13,2652,4.6781857451403885
6163685,5,B00HHITD60,"This is a great postnatal workout video.  There are multiple sections and skill levels so you can adapt the workout to fit your available time, intensity, skill level, and interest.

Workouts are quick and each one is selected individually so you don't need to skip through parts of the video to get to sections you want.",1426464000,,414,4.5675675675675675

It's set up in such a smart way for a mom lifestyle. The workouts are separated into short segments so you can fit them in around all the mom craziness & kid schedules. They're really easy to follow and there are modifications for those with Diastasis Recti. They are really different exercises from any other ab workout I've ever done. My gap closed after about a month and I've moved on to the harder stuff. I definitely see my body changing and I'm losing inches all over. I love that I can just do this in my living room in my pjs and nursing bra or whatever. The calendar ap is ok - very basic but helpful to get me to stick to it.

Plus lots of variations for abdominal separation.  The core workouts are suggested to master each one before using the next section and if you have abdominal separation you have to stay at the first level but you can progress in the other sections including conditioning and cardio.  She offers an online calender for workout options for various times a week to progress safely.  Her style also utilizes the timer method with most of her sections instead of number of reps which I like a lot.  While there are some exercises repeated, the workouts are different enough where it doesn't matter.

This leaves no room for confusion! I also like the fact that she's SUPER encouraging in her workouts and doesn't speak ""down"" to people. She puts alot of education in there too! She talks about mommies bodies after pregnancy and the needs therein. She gives great info! And did you know she's got college degrees in the stuff she's teaching us? Pretty cool!

My body felt ready and I am not breastfeeding so I don't have to worry about caloric intake. I started off with the beginner plan then moved on to the advanced plan after a week. I exercised about 2-3x/week before this baby but not during pregnancy so my muscle memory kicked back in. I also had a 3-4 finger span diastasis recti, after this program I am now down to below 2.

My upper back is much less rounded, my lower back doesn't hurt nearly as much as it used to, my core is definitely stronger, and my stomach is flatter.  I also feel better aligned and stronger all around, which is important when chasing 14-month-old twins around!  I enjoy the balance of strength training and cardio, and I look forward to my workouts each day since they are manageable time-wise.  Once I finish this program, I will certainly continue with Pretty Fierce.  I am grateful to Lindsay Brin for creating this program!",1414368000,7,971,4.920245398773006

6163712,4,B00HHITD60,"I love the program and is really nice but I have diastasis recti and I tought it would be more exercise for DR, but I love the whole concept and I like working out with Lindsey what I am able to do-for DR, all other exercise after DR is closed.",1409788800,,244,3.9
6163713,4,B00HHITD60,"Love the ab workout! I don't really care for cardio workouts, but some ppl might like it!",1407196800,,89,4.294117647058823
6163714,5,B00HHITD60,"I bought this DVD once I realized that my high-needs baby wasn't going to let me get to the gym every day. I have really enjoyed it. I am an ""advanced"" exerciser, marathon runner, triathlete, and master fitness instructor in the Army. I ran until 34 weeks in my pregnancy, lifted weights the whole time, and used the step mill at the gym until the day I went into labor. I was looking for a post-natal fitness routine that was challenging and that I could do at home, in short chunks of time. The exercise routines on this DVD are varied enough, and can be tailored to any fitness level. I love the number of different workouts and how they can be combined in different ways to get a great workout everyday. The smartphone app is also really great. It provides a calendar that tells you which combination of workouts you're to do each day. If you're looking for a fun, flexible way to get back in shape after baby, this is a great DVD!",1405382400,10,935,4.348571428571429
6163715,5,B00HHITD60,Short intense workouts make this do-able during baby naptimes or even when baby is awake! I love the calendar that helps with following workouts. These can be done at anytime of the day. I feel more energized and flexible after starting it. I'm on Phase II and hoping to see some weight loss. I do feel tighter around the core area. I highly recommend this dvd!,1404864000,,361,4.484848484848484
6163716,5,B00HHITD60,"This is the first review I have ever done, but I loved this workout so much I felt I needed to share my results. When I began this workout I had a 4 finger gap in my abdominal muscles and within a month of doing the core recovery I am down to 2 (normal range). I am sooooo happy! I was told by my doctor that was impossible. My doctor also told me to do the wrong type of abdominal workout which made my gap even larger (beware this may happen to you too). Then I found this video. This is the first time ever I have looked forward to working out. I love weightlifting but I hate cardio in general. But, I actually look forward to doing the cardio in this video! I cannot believe it. She keeps everything short and to the point and you get a great workout. I also lost several pounds during this month and now fit into my pre-pregnancy clothes. I will buy all of her workouts in the future. Thank you!

Update: I just had a doctor appointment today. My doctor was so impressed by my results, she asked what I did. I told her all about Lindsay Brin. She said she had never seen diastasis recti heal. Ever.",1404691200,164,1104,4.111111111111111
6163717,5,B00HHITD60,Great workout!  I love the toning segments but I find her cardio kind of boring.  The core sections are amazing.,1403568000,,112,4.55
6163718,4,B00HHITD60,"The instructor is good and I like the variety you have with the different workouts. It helps a lot that they are only 10 mins each so depending on how your baby is doing you can just squeak in a decent work out or you can do additional sections for a really good work out.
I'am / was in pretty good shape right before delivering (going to the gym everyday and a runner) and I have thought this a pretty good work out alternative to not being able to go to the gym.",1400544000,,464,4.0
6163719,5,B00HHITD60,"I enjoy working out and used to run more. After Baby 2, I found it too hard to get out and I was doing some random youtube cardio workouts for a while (which i liked, but it wasn't organized enough). I also had diastasis a bit and was discouraged with how slowly my core was recovering the second time around. I found this and got it on Baby Steals for 5 bucks downloaded to my Kindle Fire. I LOVE the calendar that tells me just what to do. I love the increments of 10 minutes or less. I love that it is challenging enough to give me a decent workout, but very easy to follow. I did a few weeks of her CFS Phase 1 before  starting this and lost two inches on my waist in a few weeks. My husband keeps saying he sees a difference :) I still have a few lbs of breastfeeding weight to lose (I hold on to 8-10 lbs for  the first year and my girl is 9 months) to be happier, but I am definitely stronger and stronger as I go through (on Week 6 now). I love that it is progressive and their is an emphasis on core and toning. I can't wait to try one of the Pretty Fierce after this!",1398124800,9,1077,3.890909090909091
6163720,5,B00HHITD60,This is an excellent workout. I love that it's broken down into 10 min segments so you can adjust your workout to what you want to do and how much time you have. Lindsay has a really nice manner as well,1396483200,4,202,3.951219512195122
8632787,5,B00HHITD60,This work out dvd has help my diaste recti shrink from a 4 to a 1. My core has never been Stronger! Great find!,1526169600,,111,3.6666666666666665
8632788,5,B00HHITD60,"Best $11 bucks I ever spent! My only disappointment, that I quickly corrected, is that the workout calendar does not come with the dvd as I had thought; you download it online and can choose 3 days a week; 4 and so on. I found the calendar easily online and am doing the 4 workouts per week calendar. I posted the printed calendar in my bathroom and look at it each morning to see which workouts I need to do. The workouts stack and get progressively harder but they are in short segments so somehow it doesnt feel like you're designating a lot of time (its not overwhelming).
Im on my fourth week of the workout calendar and I actually look forward to these! I was not in horrible shape prior but I definitely feel so much better and stronger (and more positive) following this calendar of workouts. They are a challenge but easy to follow and I get a good sweat with a mix of strength training, cardio and flexibility.
You can make them harder or easier depending on where you're at and on days when my baby is cranky, I put the hand weights down, load her in my front pack and squat her weight instead! I think Ill be doing these for a long time and not just post pregnancy because theyve just made me so happy.",1525219200,,1214,4.282608695652174
8632789,5,B00HHITD60,"I loved this video workout. I was a dancer, now a horticulturist,  for many years and Pilates was part of our training since I was 5yo. I'm very picky with workouts because during my dance experience it is pretty clear that more effort in workout does NOT mean better performance. Practice does. I started making the 1st core workout about 5 weeks after birth and kept at it and nothing more for a long time. Then started dancing again about 8 weeks after birth. The workout looks 'easy going' but you are actually working a lot of inner muscles you need to get back on track after birth. It was sooo good I gave the video to a friend (I hate to shelf useful material) and now in my second pregnancy I'm putting it on my Baby registry again. Even if you are not on a post natal season, these exercises will help you be mindful of your inner ab muscles in preparation for other more complicated excercices. I recommend it 100%, especially if you need to make the most of your only 8-30 minutes available workout. Just the first 8 minutes make a huge difference.",1524614400,,1060,4.408163265306122
8632790,4,B00HHITD60,Love this work out but DVDs didn't work well. They kept freezing and screwing up the menu. I had to buy online version which works perfect! This workout gives your simmering to do different every day so it never gets boring. And i love that it has a calendar to keep me on track. It builds up your fitness level and didn't take a lot of time. I do this in the evening when i put my little one down for the night. Perfect for this busy momma and I'm seeing results!!,1524355200,,465,4.065217391304348
8632791,5,B00HHITD60,"Easy to follow postnatal workout guide. Personally, I prefer working out with friends at the gym. That being said, my baby is too young to go into the nursery. This workout tape has been a blessing! I can get my workout done during midday nap time. It's quick and effective. I love the interval training style. Also, Linsday does a comprehensive postnatal core training series on the tape in clear and concise way. I used to have the ""Bounce Back Fast"" postnatal core tape, which uses the same principles, but is soooooo long and drawn out with lots of unnecessary talking. If you are looking for a good workout tape postpartum that includes postnatal core training that actually works and is easy to follow, please pick this. You will not be disappointed. She also provides a workout calendar that can fit into a newborn nap schedule. Love this! Haven't tried the prenatal tape, as I am no longer pregnant, but will definitely keep it for next time.",1523145600,,950,4.6946107784431135
