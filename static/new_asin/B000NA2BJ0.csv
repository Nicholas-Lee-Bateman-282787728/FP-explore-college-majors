2763137,4,B000NA2BJ0,"Just back from a wedding (seriously - it's sunday night) and  FINALLY got my husband to even TRY to dance because we watched this a few days before we left to drive down. That is a miracle. He was sure that he could never dance -- and SAT on the couch and watched me do the moves alone! before he finally caved and admitted : They make it  easy.
They show the guy's (""the leader's"") part - S L O W L Y  (and repeat and repeat). Then they show the gal's part, same - step by step, repeat for you, seen from front / back.
Really, there's no excuse for not getting up & at least trying it. Once he got up -- it was fun, learning together and then dancing together at the wedding (nothing fancy but he DID it!)
(I also ordered Vol. 2 but haven't seen it and he doesn't know yet...)",1414886400,2,777,3.967948717948718
2763138,5,B000NA2BJ0,"Learning to Swing by this DVD really works. Its fun, and about as comfortable a learning experience as could be had. The music is great. The instructors are fantastic. They are very professional, fun, and friendly. My wife and I are having a blast with this. If we get good enough with Swing we will cut a rug at the next function we attend!",1414540800,,341,4.34375
2763139,5,B000NA2BJ0,"I am not a big dancer myself and most things are self taught. I am very glad i came across this Swing Dancing for beginners. Its a very east to follow, step by step, that follows all the fundamentals of Swing dancing. I remember learning a couple dances back in high school. It was great to pick up a few memories from my past while learning something new.",1414454400,,356,4.25
2763140,5,B000NA2BJ0,"Ive always had an interest in trying Swing Dancing but could never get the nerve to sign up for a class and make a fool of myself.  So looking online, I found this instructional DVD and I could not be happier! In this first volume of the introduction to Swing Dancing, all of the fundamentals are presented in an easy to digest manner. The instructors Allison and Eldon are clear and concise and most of all keep it fun. With two hours of material, there is plenty to absorb here and will definitely help you get a grasp of the basics. A great starter DVD for anyone who wants to learn to dance in the comfort of their own home! Five stars!",1414195200,,640,4.245901639344262
2763141,5,B000NA2BJ0,This guide was made beautifully. My wife and I have been trying to learn how to swing dance and this taught us exactly how to do so and fast. We will now be able to impress our friends next time we go out dancing. Great product!,1414108800,,228,3.9782608695652173
2763142,4,B000NA2BJ0,"Basic, very clear instruction on this DVD. The program is very well organized and nicely sequenced. I recommend it for beginners.",1399248000,,129,5.190476190476191
2763143,5,B000NA2BJ0,Great video.  Thorough instruction from  a couple with lots of experience teaching students.  Would definitely recommend this for swing dance beginners.,1346198400,,152,6.142857142857143
2763144,5,B000NA2BJ0,I enjoyed this.  The instructions are easy to follow and the dancing is fun.  We wanted to take lessons but have no where nearby to do so.  This has been the next best thing.,1335916800,,174,4.0588235294117645
2763145,4,B000NA2BJ0,"I bought this video as a starter for practicing for the wedding. We are both beginners to swing.  I enjoy it and find it easy to learn from, but my fiance is having a harder time (maybe since he really does not like to dance!) He says that the steps are hard for him to follow.  I think that they do a great job breaking down each step, showing the male version, then the female version, then together.  The male instructor's pants are hilious and worth the money just for that!",1304208000,5,478,4.230769230769231
2763146,5,B000NA2BJ0,"I have always loved the way swing dancing looks, there is something so poetic about it. However, I am cursed with two left feet and going to dance classes would be both embarrassing and add some serious stress to my bank account. I work pretty much full time and go to school full time so I would definitely not be able to find a class that would fit into my hectic schedule. Luckily, Dance Crazy resolved this problem for me.

With their dance mastery systems you can learn just about any dance in the comfort of your own home. When I received the Swing Dance Volume 1 video in the mail, I could not wait to try it. I am happy to say, this video is so comprehensive that even someone as uncoordinated and clumsy as me was able to follow it with great ease.

Of course, I did have a few mishaps attempting some of the steps the first time but it was all in good fun. This video allows you to learn the art of this dance at your own pace and on your own schedule without having to break the bank or commute to and from classes. This video is 2 hours long but the instructors in the video take you step-by-step through the moves, helping you learn the technique you need in order to build a foundation to grow upon.

The instructions are very clear and basic so it isn't hard to understand what you are supposed to be doing. I was surprised by how quickly I was able to pick up on these steps! I would definitely recommend this video to anyone who loves the style of Swing Dance and wants to learn how to dance it themselves.

2763147,4,B000NA2BJ0,I loved the brief 15 minute lessons. I used this as a date night with my husband and we loved it. It was very clear and to the point. It was not cheesy like most instructional videos. We are having a lot of fun with it! So glad the company choose me to review it!,1419897600,,263,3.8
2763148,5,B000NA2BJ0,"My husband and I used to swing dance, but only knew a few steps. We would love to go out dancing again and this DVD is great preparation. The City Swing is the first dance you will learn. It breaks it down step by step. First it looks at foot movement and then adds in body and hand positions. The second dance is the East Coast Swing. This dance looks a bit more complicated, but is taught in a very easy to learn manner as well. You will also learn how to add in turns. I feel my husband and I are ready for a night of dancing. Overall this is a great introduction to Swing dancing.
I received free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.",1419638400,,668,4.1461538461538465
2763149,5,B000NA2BJ0,"I feel like I am very dance challenged so I was very excited to try this Swing dvd. I went to the menu-then scene selection and picked one movement at a time. Once you pick a movement (like The Basic Step for example), then you have the options to learn the step with the demo, mens breakdown, womens breakdown, dance men/women together, and dance together with music. The instructors are VERY clear and easy to follow. They show you the steps from a couple angles, as well as the different breakdowns mentioned above. The background, outfits. and music are fun-I highly recommend this dvd. Dancing is a great way to have fun and stay active as a couple!

Item was shipped fast, sealed and item came as described!",1419638400,,713,4.5703125
2763150,5,B000NA2BJ0,"I got this for review. I have been interested in swing dancing. I am getting married in a few months and thought I could use this beginners guide to help guide my fiance and me into a spectacular dance routine that would leave people speechless. I had also heard dancing was great cardio exercise and wanted to try it out. I have indeed toned up muscle and lost a few inches off my waist since trying these dance steps. I am a bit more clumsier than my fiance is, it too me a bit longer to learn the steps where it was easier for him to learn how to do it. I liked that this was not boring and it was something that helped us bond in a different way.",1419552000,3,650,4.007692307692308
2763151,5,B000NA2BJ0,"I received the Swing Beginners Volume 1 DVD, which is a professionally packaged 1-DVD set. I have to note that this is part 1 of a 2-part Swing Series. I received part 2 as well, and I'll go over that in a review on that page, but I'd like to note that these are sold separately. You'll learn all of the basics on part 1, but to really step up your Swing game, you can also purchase part 2.

The instructors for this series and Eldon and Alison, the same instructors for the Waltz DVD from Dance Crazy, and they are friendly, and incredibly graceful, dance instructors. I really enjoyed their teaching style in the Waltz video, and they bring the same clear, easy to understand instruction to Swing dancing as well.

They go into detail on two Swing dance styles, the City Swing, and the East Coat Swing, which is a faster step than the City Swing, but not too hard since the music is a little slower.

They take you through the Basic Step for the City Swing through a demonstration, an in-depth men's breakdown, the women's breakdown, danced together, then danced with music. Then the take you through the same instruction for the East Coast Swing.

From there, they show you some moves and then demonstrate them for both the City Swing and the East Coast Swing, like the Release Break, the Right Underarm Turn, the Left Underarm Turn, the Women's Right & Left Turn, The Cuddle, and the Men's Turns. They also go through a chapter of Tips, the 3 different types of of Swing, and Social vs. Competitive Swing Dancing.

Overall, I loved it. I have always wanted to learn Swing dancing, and I'm feeling pretty confident. This DVD will get you right out and dancing a beginning Swing with some great stylistic moves.",1419552000,,1713,4.53074433656958
2763152,5,B000NA2BJ0,I don't really have much to say because I really liked it! It's fun and easy to follow. I absolutely hate working out and this is a great way for me to get active with out associating it to working out!,1419552000,,202,3.951219512195122
2763153,4,B000NA2BJ0,"I have always wanted to know how to swing dance. It just looks so fun and energetic. I love to watch it, so why not try it. This Beginning Swing Dance dvd  by Dance Crazy is great. It's a step by step instructional dvd for beginners. You really need no experience whatsoever. This is the first of a two dvd set, and this first dvd is two hours long. It will teach you how to begin and give you a solid swing foundation. The instructors will break down each pattern, giving you all the information you need on technique, style, and connection. They not only make it easy to learn but a lot of fun. I had a lot of fun trying out this video. The instructional style made it easy to pick up. I tried it with my boyfriend and neither of us has much dancing experience . We had a great time, and picked up the fundamentals of swing with a bit of practice. It's also a great workout, that you can actually have fun doing. I can't wait to try the next video, so we can add to what we learned. I'm still not a swing expert, but I have some new moves. I'm hoping we can try our moves out at the next wedding we go to. I received this product for free for my honest unbiased review.",1419379200,,1171,4.047413793103448
2763154,5,B000NA2BJ0,"A really great start to learning how to Swing dance.  This is the first DVD in a set, and it's great because swing is an extremely difficult dance to learn, but this makes it look SO easy.  With over 2 hours of guided instruction, you don't need to have ANY dance experience to learn this and use this DVD.  If you don't know what Swing dance is, look it up because it is amazing!  If you watch Dancing With The Stars you should know exactly what you are going to be learning :)  It is a part of Ballroom dancing and with this first DVD you will learn the basics and get on your way to becoming a master of Swing dance.  Then pick up the second DVD and you will really become the master, you will be the envy of all your friends and be able to swing at any party :)  I loved it because I am a Cheerleader for our local Derby Girl team so I have been wanting to really learn all different types of dance - these DVDs have really helped me and they are so easy to follow even for the person who has no dance experience.  I received a complimentary product to test.",1419206400,,1062,4.023809523809524
2763155,5,B000NA2BJ0,I  was so excited to receive this Swing  DVD set for review. This is a very simple instructions to learn Swing Dancing. I always watch on Tv and  wanted to learn.  Now I can do it in the comfort of my own home.  Each DVD is about 120 minutes long and I love the step by step instructions. There are even some parts where the feet of the instructor is focused so that I can follow it properly,1419033600,,391,3.9615384615384617
2763156,4,B000NA2BJ0,"I like that the DVD shows the steps from both the male, and female point of view, then together before adding in music. It slowly adds to a routine step by step. During my review I think it's very easy to follow, and pick up on. The only thing that would make it better is to have a professional there letting you know for sure if you're positioned correctly.",1418947200,,359,4.217391304347826
2763157,5,B000NA2BJ0,So much fun :-),1418947200,,15,3.0
2763158,4,B000NA2BJ0,"Although this dvd is very dated- the instruction is excellent .  It is well broken down for the beginner and clearly demonstrated and probably the best disc for the jitterbug that I have been able to find, I ordered many others and really like both Vol. 1 and 2.  Vol. 2 came in an album called "" Ballroom Dance Mastery System"". and is not  as silly as another Dance Crazy series on Salsa..  Out of 5 or 6 different instructors and their DVDs plus wasted time looking at their demonstrations, this is by far the best I've found. I find it hard to believe it is on on Dance Crazy's label;since their Salsa albums were so laborious and kitchy.. I highly recommend"" Learn to Swing Dance Swing"" and find it well worth going for the Mastery series just to get Vol. 2.  I haven't gone  through the other dances yet but hope the rest of the series is equally good.",1418083200,3,857,4.325
2763159,5,B000NA2BJ0,"Dancing workouts and learn-to-dance DVDS have become more popular thanks to reality shows, such as Dancing With The Stars. Personally, I haven't taken much interests in dancing, mostly because I have two left feet. However, I do like exercising and beginner dancing workouts are more low intensity than other at-home workouts, so I have been trying out some dancing workouts including Learn to Swing - Beginning Volume 1 from DanceCrazy.com.

If you have every seen an older movie with swing dancing in it, then you know the steps in it are fast, so attempting to learn such a dance may seem like a bit of a challenge. The two instructors in Learn to Swing - Beginning Volume 1 give a step-by-step guide to learn several dance patterns.

You'll learn how to:

Basic Step (City Swing)

East Coast Step

Release Break

Right Underarm Turn

Left Underarm Turn

Right & Left Turn

The Cuddle

Men's Turns

Most the patterns have the male and female instructors showing the steps separately and then the combine the moves as they dance together. All the patterns are put together in the end for two dance sequences (City and East Coast).

Overall, the dance steps in Learn to Swing - Beginning Volume 1 are easy to follow and anybody who watches the DVD will be able to learn how to swing dance quickly. I have enjoyed trying out the DVD and I recommend it to others.

2763164,5,B000NA2BJ0,"Let me come right out and say that I don't have an ounce of grace or rhythm in my body!! I have recently become engaged (so, of course I will be dancing at my reception) and I found Beginners Swing Volume 1 by Dance Crazy VERY helpful to me!!

They go into amazing detail, take everything slow for beginners and who doesnt love the wonderful music?!?! This DVD is perfect for anyone like me that loves to dance but just doesnt know how. I will be able to incorporate what I have learned into my reception now!! Highly recommended, if I was able to pick up on the moves easily anyone can!!

I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.",1416700800,,780,4.409722222222222
2763165,5,B000NA2BJ0,"I am excited to review the Beginners Swing Volume 1 DVD!  Let me tell you why!

I am going to make a declaration here and now.  I do not like working out!  I hate it!  Whew, got that off my chest.  Now, I realize that hating exercise and needing exercise are two different things.  In order to maintain a healthy body and weight, I need to be active.  Finding ways that I can be active while having fun is a challenge at times.

I think I have found my exercise niche!  Dancing!  I live in a rural area so I don't have access to a dance studio willing to teach this grandma to dance.  Luckily, DanceCrazy.com has released a series of DVDs so I can learn dances at home.  Immediately, the embarrassment factor is gone since I won't have anyone else watching me try to learn dance steps so Im liking this even more.  I am using the Beginners Swing Volume 1 DVD.  This grandma is going to learn to Swing!!

The Swing dance DVD features multiple camera angles and picture in picture so you can see every move the dance instructor makes.  There is music to practice each step.  The DVD includes detailed tips you cant find anywhere else.  This series of swing dance DVDs are meant for beginners (ME!).  The instructors really do break down each step so you can learn techniques, style, and connection while swing dancing.  Its so much fun that everyone in my house was dancing away!",1416614400,,1377,4.384920634920635

8176108,5,B000NA2BJ0,"If you have two left feet and have ever wanted to learn Swing Dance, this DVD is for you. I am not by any means a great dancer. My favorite move involved rocking back in forth in a slow dance fashion with my husband. But when I found this DVD I just had to try it! It sounded so fun and since I could do it at home, there was no embarrassing classes to take where I risked being the only person who couldn't dance. This DVD got here super fast and I had to try it immediately.

While my husband was not home at the time, it was okay because the way they break up the instruction they show the male and female dancers separately and then show them together. (so I could get some practice in before hubby got here! ;) ) It was incredibly easy to follow. They explained it step by step and showed each step from different angles so there was no missing a thing. My husband and I really liked the music on the DVD and how quickly we were able to pick up the dance moves on here to develop some form of technique. We try to practice with the DVD about once a week and plan to move on to another form of dance soon! Can't wait! :)",1422403200,,1124,3.9734513274336285
