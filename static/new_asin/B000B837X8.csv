8083078,4,B000B837X8,"I received this a second time this week, so I could show my students in human development the interview with Leni Riefenstahl on her 100th Birthday.

3 stars for the film (her Storm over Mont Blanc is better) and 5 stars for the hour interview.

Why did she begin her directing career by directing Das Blaue Licht (The Blue Light)?: Because she didn't have the budget to hire a director-- so she directed it herself.

Why did she never have children? Because she did not find a man she liked.

She is awesome, and savvy, and far smarter and more engaging at 100 than most people I know at half her age.",1368662400,2,602,4.348214285714286
8083079,4,B000B837X8,"Long before she was Hitler's favorite film director, Leni Riefenstahl was German silent cinema's sweetheart and the queen of the mountain movies, and looking at the remarkable The White Hell of Pitz Palu it's not hard to see why: easy on the eye and an expressive and appealing actress, if you absolutely had to be stuck up a mountain with someone she's the kind of person who would be on your list. The film itself is so astonishingly visually striking and engrossing that it's hard to believe it's so largely forgotten: you're more likely to see the amazingly vivid mountain sequences turning up as stock footage (most notably in Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe) than you are to see this crop up on the revival circuit or on TV, so Kino's 134-minute DVD of the 1998 German restoration is particularly welcome.

The father of the mountain movie, main director Arnold Fanck (who shot the location exteriors while G.W. Pabst did the studio interiors) has a remarkable feeling for the changing face and nature of the title character, the mountain itself, able to shift from joyous beauty to menace in a matter of seconds. The shifts of light, the effect of the wind, the changes in temperature are as expressive as any actor's performance, creating a real adversary for its engaged couple who get lost and have to fight it for survival. The prologue sets the tone perfectly, as another couple's cocky confidence turns to tragedy, the slowly melting icicles driving the survivor mad as he waits for help, the film mirroring it minutes later as another icicle hanging from a mountain hut drips onto Riefenstahl's hand as she lies in the sun blissfully unaware of the danger it is foreshadowing. There's joy too, particularly in a remarkably vivid sequence of a plane flying around their hut in an energetic display of daring acrobatics that makes Sepp Allgeier's camerawork almost take flight itself.

(The pilot is played by WW1's second most successful flying ace Ernst Udet who, like Reifenstahl, would have his career destroyed by his association with Hitler - in his case with rather more finality. Having been instrumental in building up the Luftwaffe, political infighting and domestic problems drove him to alcoholism and a mental breakdown and his suicide in 1941 after Goring used him as a scapegoat for losing the Battle of Britain).

Unfortunately, after the dramatic entrance of `the Ghost of the Mountain,' the surviving lover who haunts the slopes looking for the frozen body of his bride, the film starts to lose its grip and only intermittently regains it. It's small wonder US distributors Universal cut the film down to 79 minutes from its original 150-minute reported running time: even in this not-quite-complete restoration it's 50 minutes before they start their ill-fated climb, the husband-to-be driven to accompany the `Ghost' by what one suspects is some Pabst-inspired jealousy over Leni's romantic awe for the bereaved climber's morbid romantic quest.

The influence on Fred Zinnemann's final film, Five Days One Summer - which also revolves around the frozen corpse of a lost love and the possibility of tragedy repeating itself - is clear, but, perhaps unsurprising considering his reputation for sadistically putting his cast in real harm's way, Fanck is less successful when it comes to drawing us into these people's story. He's obviously more interested in the mountain than his characters or the plot, both of which are thinly sketched out to avoid eating up screen time that could be better spent on more shots of the mountain, gradually eroding their effectiveness. It doesn't help that once disaster strikes and its trio are trapped on a mountain ledge the sum total of their efforts to escape are waving a flag and, at night, an oil lamp while waiting for someone to rescue them or that there's no real interaction between them as their hopes fade. As a result, when one of them does rather pointlessly make the ultimate sacrifice it all seems rather arbitrary and academic since we're so uninvolved in their fate.

What carries the film are the set pieces, particularly a visually stunning night sequence where the villagers make their way up the mountain and into a crevice and ice cave to recover the dead bodies of a group of climbers by torchlight in a remarkable chiaroscuro play of light and shadow that's worth the price of admission on its own. From the captions it's clear that the ice cave sequence was originally given a red tint to turn it into a diabolical inferno, but the restored print on Kino's DVD has no tints (not a major problem: the film looks fine in black and white), which isn't the only change from the original version that might disparage some purists. Kino's version also replaces the German intertitles with English ones, though these are presented in the style of the German version, while the various notes and letters have burned in subtitle translations. Nonetheless, the restoration feels like its treated the film with respect, and Ashley Irwin's new score is particularly impressive, adopting a bolero motif for the climbing sequences and the ever faithful Dies Iraes for the mountain in threatening mood.

Kino's DVD also includes the last TV interview with Leni Reifenstahl, a substantial 52-minutes with the surprisingly sprightly 100-year old that skirts around most of the major issues, as well as a stills gallery and an intriguing extract from the abridged German talkie reissue version that, unusually, dubbed the characters dialogue in such perfect synchronization you could be forgiven for thinking it had been shot with sound.

Its pacing and story problems alone ensure that The White Hell of Pitz Palu isn't the deathless classic of lore, but it still impresses despite its faults.",1366588800,3,5771,4.9989594172736735

Newlyweds Johannes Krafft (Gustav Diessl) and Maria Krafft (Mizzi Gtzel) have been warned not to be goofing off while they are climbing the pale mountain in the Bernina Alps of Switzerland. Of course, they do not listen and Maria falls into a crack and her rope brakes.

Now many years later Dr. Johannes Krafft is still wandering over the mountain looking for his lost Maria.

A new couple come to the common cabin on the where many climbers and skiers start from. Then they meet Dr. Krafft.  A hand full of student hikers are about to attempt the toughest part of the mountain. Krafft wants to beat them to it. Only it is too dangerous to go alone. Therefore, the couple decides to help him get the jump on the students.

Well the race is on and here come the student up the back strip. Now we remember what happened to Maria Krafft when she did not heed the warning to pay attention. So guess what? Yep Hans Brandt (Ernst Petersen) insisted on taking the lead so he can show his stuff.

Will the students who are taking a shortcut get there first? On the other hand, do they get a few surprises?
This film is a true cliffhanger.
Will Hans showoff his stuff or will they get stuck on a cliff cave and need to be saved by Flieger Udet (Ernst Udet)?

What a minute did we not see Ernst Udet save someone with his plane in ""Sturme uber dem Mont Blanc""

This film is part of a series of German Mountain films that were popular in the lat twenties and early thirties. The stars of the film are the mountains and the clouds (shot in elapse time.) In this film, there were contrived and real avalanches. Actor Leni Riefenstahl almost was avalanched.

8083081,4,B000B837X8,"Arnold Fanck's spellbinding THE WHITE HELL OF PITZ PALU is a 1929 German silent with English intertitles and a powerful orchestra score.  The  notorious Leni Riefenstahl stars along with two German actors I have never heard of, Gustav Diessl and Ernst Peterson.  Pitz Palu is a dangerously steep Swiss mountain that a young mountain climbing couple and another man decide to ascend.  But once they get to the top, how do they get back down without freezing to death?!  Fanck loved making adventure films like this one, on actual locations, long before the current era of computer graphics and matte paintings.  He directed the mountain climbing sequences, and the renowned G. W. Pabst directed the first half of the movie back in a Swiss town.  Fanck edited the movie and collaborated on the screenplay with Ladislaus Vajda.  The fearless and beautiful photography is by Sepp Allgeier, Richard Angst, and Hans Schneeberger.  The stunning music score was recorded by Ashley Irwin in 1998.  THE WHITE HELL OF PITZ PALU is a marvelous adventure film, a long 133 minutes, when you want something unusual.  The Kino Video print source is an uncut nitrate print that is in beautiful condition, or at least has been restored by European film archives to look beautiful.

Also included on the Kino DVD is a 59 minute documentary chat  from 2002 by Sandra Maischberger with a 100 year old Leni Riefenstahl, who is just in from filming a scuba diving movie!  She shows Maischberger various scrapbooks and autobiographies, plus stills from her oceanography movies.  We also see scenes of her infamous TRIUMPH OF THE WILL (1934) and epic OLYMPIA (1937).  Leni is a fascinating paradox, and this conversation (in German with English subtitles) makes me want to see the 190 minute  1993 documentary on her.

There are also a photo gallery for PITZ PALU and an excerpt from a 1935 sound reissue.",1180828800,3,1880,4.914285714285715
8083082,5,B000B837X8,Although originally a silent release (German) - this is one of my all time favorite films.  I sincerely hope that Ray Harryhausen and Legend films will be able to colorize this film sometime in the near future - because it's spectacular mountain (Pitz Palu) scenery truly lends itself to the colorization process.  Mountain climbing film - staring a young Leni Riefenstahl - against a backdrop of the tragedy - (of a doctor having lost his young bride ten years earlier on this very same mountain) - as portrayed magnificently by Gustav Diessl.,1173484800,,544,4.9021739130434785
8083083,5,B000B837X8,"Unlike Pabst, Arnold Franck has been a figure unexplainably forgotten at the moment of naming the great German filmmakers in this diamantine period, where the flame of the creativeness was directly proportional to the anguish and fears in the rest of the German citizenship.

Strongly influenced by the adventure novels of the Swiss Gustav Renker, who seemed to be possessed by the eternal conflict between the man and the nature, under the perspective of domain and constant struggle. The location photography was achieved on the snow-covered slopes of 12.000 foot high Piz Pal&uuml; in the Bernina Alps of Switzerland.

The undeniable artistic and financial triumph and universal acclamation was instantaneous, specially in a historic transition where the epic seemed to be absolutely absent from all the imaginable stages; because while Brecht and Kurt Weil appealed to the cynicism and decadence state; Shostakovich and Prokoviev depicted the somber nightmare around the fist iron man and Picasso gave us his Guernica; the loyal Surrealism and Dadaism Cerberus such Chirico, Dali, Ernst and the Great Depression in North America are evident and notorious evidences the world certainly was not the best of the possible worlds.

 It is easily evident the underground  voltage tension and anticipation premonitory for the cloudy times to come through the avalanches, precipices and high risks to climb and conquer: As you may realize the metaphor could not be more obvious.

 Go for this flawless film.",1136419200,8,1503,5.343220338983051
8083084,4,B000B837X8,"This late German silent is very much an action and mountain-climbing disaster film, of which genre ""The Holy Mountain"" is probably the best remembered, and in comparison ""The White Hell of Pitz Palu"" probably falls short in a few areas.  Firstly, there is not much of a story or plot as it revolves around three main characters who have a climbing accident, get stuck and inevitably need to be rescued.  Without a doubt the action and disaster scenes (climbing walls of ice, falls and avalanches) are expertly done, and the cinematography is close to breathtaking.  In fact, watching many of the scenes - beautiful melting and dripping icicles, moody clouds, glistening walls of ice and simply the rugged snow-capped mountains made me wish it could be in colour in order to be absolutely perfect.  From a visual viewpoint, ""The White Hell of Pitz Palu"" can't be flawed, and I'm sure that anyone interested in mountaineering (or even photography of such mountains) will find this film exciting and interesting.  But I'm not a mountain nor snow and ice person, and I usually prefer a good, more complex story and interesting characters, and for such viewers this film might feel rather slow and too much of the same thing.  Although the orchestral musical score is new and suited to the scenes, it might not be to everyone's taste and I found it rather heavy at times - but perhaps that was the intention after all, since ominous big mountains do create that kind of mood!  Nevertheless, I can see plenty of merit in other aspects of this film such as the impressive visual, photographic qualities (the picture quality is very good, by the way) and also a glimpse into the lives of the characters such as Dr Krafft who lost his wife in an earlier mountain climbing adventure, and who thereafter `haunted' the mountain, roaming around alone - until he meets a young honeymoon couple who change everything for him.  The emphasis and focus in this film are not on the story or people, but rather on the physical mountain itself and above all, the forces of nature: wind, ice, storms and mere mortals staying alive in the ruthless elements.  For more story and character angles with the same star (Leni Riefenstahl) and also directed by Arnold Franck, ""The Holy Mountain"" might still be the best of this `mountain film' genre for the general viewer.",1131753600,7,2343,4.794044665012407
8083085,3,B000B837X8,"Having seen and enjoyed THE HOLY MOUNTAIN some time back, I was really looking forward to seeing this film which is considered by many to be the summit of the mountain film genre. Much has been made of the fact that the renowned director G.W. Pabst (PANDORA'S BOX, DIARY OF A LOST GIRL) was brought in to co-direct along with Arnold Fanck who created the genre. It's been said that this was done at Leni Riefenstahl's insistence to try and give the film and its characters more depth. Whoever was responsible for it made a big mistake. What emerges in WHITE HELL OF PITZ PAULU is a film with an agonizingly slow first half that stops dead in its tracks whenever it tries to focus on the three principal players, a mountain guide who has lost his wife and a young couple there for a holiday. The dramatic scenes directed by Pabst are totally out of sync with the Fanck's outdoor scenes giving the impression that you're watching two different movies. The mountain footage is breathtaking as usual with the seemingly impossible camerawork bolstered by a number of airplane shots. Some of the scenes such as the recovery of bodies in an ice grotto and the rescue of the couple from a frozen ledge linger in the memory long afterwards and in fact have shown up in a number of documentaries from time to time.

The rest of the film however is a real mess and is not at all what I expected. The performances by Riefenstahl and Ernst Petersen as the young couple are suprisingly flat which I attribute to Pabst's direction as they were much more full of life in HOLY MOUNTAIN. Gustav Diesel as the mountain climber gives the type of performance that the film needs but it isn't enough. Another big problem with this version of PITZ PALU which was restored in 1998 is the score provided for it by Ashley Irwin. A lot of it sounds like bad Soviet military music that just doesn't complement the action at all like Aljoscha Zimmerman's score did for HOLY MOUNTAIN. Silent movies were never silent and the musical accompaniment can really make or break the film and this time around unfortunately it's the latter. I don't think a good score could have saved this movie but it certainly would have helped it. THE WHITE HELL OF PITZ PAULU is worth seeing especially if you are interested in Leni Riefenstahl or the mountain film in general but of those available on DVD HOLY MOUNTAIN is definitely the one to see. Hopefully Riefenstahl's 1932 opus THE BLUE LIGHT will come out soon in a restored version for that is where the mountain film truly reached its peak.",1131753600,12,2550,4.579868708971554
