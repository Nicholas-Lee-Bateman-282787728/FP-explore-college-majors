8202987,5,B000RXZIM0,"I just finished watching this and was, quite simply, astonished at the number of women who expressed the same things I've been thinking and feeling about the mosque in my local community.

I don't want to be in a separate room, hidden behind a partition, or allowed in a room with men only during non-prayer hours and made to stay on the side of the room where they turn off the lights and the men turn away so their backs are to us.

I've felt isolated, frustrated, angry, sad, and unimportant. Until women and the men who oppose segregation in the mosques step up and speak out, and continue to do so in spite of those who would continue to enforce the segregation by not giving us the choice to do otherwise, nothing will change.",1343174400,,732,4.4148148148148145
8202988,5,B000RXZIM0,An excellent account of one woman's struggle to come to terms with the increasingly conservative face of Islam in North America. This film conveys the author's increasing sense of isolation from segments of her community but always remains respectful of Islam. Educational and informative- would be a good choice for schools and libraries. Purchase if you can find a copy.,1195862400,4,372,5.216666666666667
