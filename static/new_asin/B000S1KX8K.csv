Most of the time they are better than the reuns on satellite or cable. I am activly looking for more LMN titles for sale here at Amazon.",1241481600,5,412,4.036585365853658

2878737,4,B000S1KX8K,"A little bit of suspense, always just brewing in the background,  keeps this film from being overly sweet or, on the other hand, violent.  But it does play with your head a tad, and kept me guessing the entire time how the whole deal would be wrapped up and served.  Quirky Diane, (Peta) loses her husband to his suicide, after he falls for a ponzi scheme which wipes the couples financial security and life of ease totally off the map.  Undeniably fierce in her need to get away and heal, she heads off into the sunset, intending to retreat to her parents home, somewhere in CA.  She drives her beater across the states, but to her dismay, has major car trouble in a place so small, we never even learn its name.  Broke and desperate, unable to pay for her car repair, she takes any job she can.  Which is how she winds up working in a greasy spoon called the cash cow.  This is when the story becomes interesting, as for some quirk of fate, she sees the man responsible for all her pain, seated at the counter in the Cash Cow Restaurant.  That's as far as I will  enter the story quick facts, because for some reason, I feel you really have to watch the film to realize how determined she is to get her life back on track. She's pretty, clever, teasing, and just a little bit vengeful, but watching her figure out the scheme, I think a tiny bit of leeway should be granted.

It's a really good film, no F bombs, but definitely not for kids.  This is a clean but adult film.  If you've ever wondered how a ponzi scheme taps into the human need for control and greed, this film will enlighten you. Give it a look, it's 90 minutes of clever bait and switch, done rather well on what appears to be a limited budget. Good continuity, dialogue is biting and swift, and they don't waste film time with foolish and unnecessary back office tricks.; Just a good film about a get rich quick scam, and the mystery is who will win when the stakes are so high? I enjoyed it, and would watch it again.  Recommended!",1452297600,9,2002,4.304

2878739,5,B000S1KX8K,I like went the actress or actor from different Tv show or movie can show us how they can act in a movie and they are just as good on a tv show as in a  movie.,1373414400,,159,3.2972972972972974
2878740,5,B000S1KX8K,"Any movie or TV Show with Peta Wilson in it
is a 5 Star Rating unless the writing is bad.

Peta Wilson is the most ""Underrated"" Actress
in Hollywood today and it's a ""Shame"" that
Hollywood doesn't use her in more things.",1345334400,,220,4.238095238095238
2878741,4,B000S1KX8K,"Interesting movie. Ms. Wilson delivers a very convincing performance. Her main claim to fame is of course ""Nikita"", but she really deserves more acclaim. A very competent actress.",1340236800,3,179,5.428571428571429
2878742,5,B000S1KX8K,I've seen this movie and I loved it. Anything that has Peta Wilson in it I want. She is an Awesome actress and a very underrated actress at the same time. Hollywood doesn't know what they are missing out on. You won't go wrong buying and watching this movie. And as soon as Amazon puts it on sale with an English Version I will buy more than one copy in case they decide not to put it out on sale again.,1317859200,2,403,3.9876543209876543

Peta Wilson shows why she is one of the most underrated actresses of her generation. Cross the wrong woman and payback can be a bitch! It is our loss that Wilson wasn't able to make more movies that channeled her inner-Nikita.",1504828800,2,325,5.037037037037037
