7799342,5,1581333722,"As all those kung fu (or actually, wu shu) videos from Steve de Masco, they're pretty unique, well explained, outlined step by step, and are great excercises not just for martial arts, but e.g. for health purposes.",1462147200,,214,4.8108108108108105

7799344,5,1581333722,"I enjoyed watching this video, but it is only a introduction to leopard kung fu.  You only learn a few forms and thier applications.",1362873600,,132,4.5
7799345,3,1581333722,"I respect DeMasco's background and he is a very thoughtful instructor for explaining the application of particular forms.  He also has a healthy respect for multiple systems which he's cross-trained with a high-level of proficiency.  That being said, these forms, all of the ""shaolin"" animal forms are derivative forms not 'authentic'.  Granted, what is shown to tourists at the current shaolin temple is also wushu derivative and much less rooted in praxis then what is demonstrated here. These forms were pulled together by Tak Wah Eng quite some time ago (I learned these in the 90s).  To be clear, the application explained within the forms is excellent.  The format of the DVD itself is atrocious.  There is no practical way to view different sections, since it's been put together  as one continuous production.  I believe this was taped back in the 90s and reformatted horribly onto DVD.  These DVDs also do not play in all players.  Buyer-be-ware.  I would prefer these to be remade using a better format (see martialskill's productions in this respect).

The Snake Form in particular of all of the forms, is in my opinion the weakest demonstration of various principles of this style.  The demonstration of the form shows the classic brute-force approach of American Kempo/Karate--something that clearly higher-ranks have to unlearn and you can tell the assistants working with Demasco have yet to unlearn it.  There is no supple-waist, legs are stiff, shoulders are rigid.  DeMasco presents above-average form.  I think the over-all problem is not DeMasco, but the form and the way it is taught and how that fits with the background of the systems they are being grafted upon.  I think it is over-all a good trend to find the roots of kempo/karate back in traditional kung-fu, but that more likely than not means studying traditional kung-fu.  What you get in these presentations of the forms, is the stiff hard power that is ingrained in a system of martial arts trying to perform a form/style that emphasizes internal/soft power.  It looks awkward.",1275868800,3,2060,5.023598820058997
7799346,5,1581333722,"All needed excercises and snake form revealed here on this DVD. Excercises are very important and I'm not hurry with them for I am making it with fun and without a pressure on myself.

But what I noticed by myself it's not just a wushu training - these excercises with some tai chi knowledge (and maybe without as well - I don't know as I practised both) are very helpful for health and good mood and disposion. It's only important to not exaggerate.

I highly recommend snake form for many purposes: wushu training, good mood, health and probably even more.",1246665600,,558,4.57
7799347,5,1581333722,DUDE. I've been purchasing a lot of martial arts dvd and I thought that all martial arts dvd were the same....but with this dvd...I never knew about the Hidden Techniques within the steps. I would really say that this dvd is worth everything....better than the other dvds. The instructor also shows you exercise techniques to help improve your snake form. Every movement has a technique with them. Check it out yourself. I would say this is the best one out of my collection of dvds because it goes in depth explanation.,1238457600,,520,4.725274725274725
7799348,5,1581333722,"I have written great reviews for this series and with the Leopard you will use a lot of fist strikes and power techniques of self defense.

Begin the tape wth general exercises, then start a workout geared toward the Leopard.
Master DeMasco then shows you the form in normal speed then in slow motion. He then breaks it down step by step, several times and explains the self defense techniques associated with each part.

Excellent instruction and this series is a must for anyone interested in traditional Shaolin kung fu.",1233360000,3,523,4.8
7799349,5,1581333722,"I have purchased all 5 of Master DeMascos videos and they are one of the best training sets you can get.
He shows you the form in fast and slow motion, then breaks it down step by step, repeats them several time and demonstrates the self defense techniques of the form too.
You start off with some general Shaolin exercises and then go to a workout geared to the animal in the video.
Master DeMasco also includes highlights of the Shaolin history through out the videos.
I have purchased many self defense training tapes, but this is the best I have ever seen.
There is something for everyone in this system.
Snake style is geared more for the leaner, quicker body type of practitioner.
I recieved my black belt in this system and encourage the student to start with snake first.",1233360000,3,779,4.531914893617022
