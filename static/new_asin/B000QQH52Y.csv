2839296,5,B000QQH52Y,"I was looking for Buckaroo BonZai, but it is prohibitively expensive by itself.  I found this collection, including Buckaroo, and it was much, much cheaper.  Sweet!",1400544000,3,164,5.269230769230769
2839297,5,B000QQH52Y,"These are some of the funniest, without meaning to be, movies of the science fiction style. The Killer Klowns with all the slapstick humor is great. It makes you think twice about cotton candy.  Buckaroo Banzai saving the world from the aliens that landed for War of the Worlds radio broadcast is a laugh riot, even when it's supposed to be sad.  Spaceballs is the funniest Mel Brooks movie ever, and a family favorite. The quotes are unforgettable, with a short, clutzy version of Darth Vader and veiled references to other movies that will have you watching it again and again. It has become a classic. You won't be sorry to have this when you hear the ""nothing's on TV"" from your family.",1364774400,6,690,4.6016260162601625

2839300,4,B000QQH52Y,"Astronomy 101 collects three movies from the 80's in a single case.  What you're essentially getting is a re-packaging of some DVDs, which is nice, as the DVD releases for Killer Klowns and Buckaroo Banzai are loaded with extras, and those extras are all retained in this set.

As for the movies themselves, you get two excellent cult classics and one Mel Brooks movie that hasn't held up as well as some of his others.  Here's the breakdown:

Killer Klowns From Outer Space:  As the title might suggest, this is hardly high art.  This film is a fun throwback to 50's monster/alien invasion movies (with plenty of plot points in common with the Blob).  The title pretty much sums it up, aliens that look like clowns come to earth and capture/kill people for the purpose of eating them.  What makes this very silly concept succeed (and what makes this movie a genuine cult classic) is the complete commitment to and thoroughness of the idea.  Its not just aliens that look like clowns chasing and capturing people, its that these clowns shoot heat seeking pop corn, have balloon animal tracking dogs, wrap people in cotton candy, and drink their blood with crazy straws.  It also helps that the actors basically play it straight.  Its mostly funny, but does serve up a chill or two.  If you dig old B-movies, you'll like what they did here.

Buckaroo Banzai (I'm not typing the full title):  This one is a love it or hate it film, though the first time you see it you'll probably just be really confused.  Here's the plot summary from Amazon's page for the DVD... ""Peter Weller stars as Buckaroo, an acclaimed neurosurgeon, particle physicist, and, of course, rock star. He travels with the Hong Kong Cavaliers, a band of hard-rocking scientists who are also really good dressers. Buckaroo's interdimensional experiments with his Operation Overthruster throw him (and the Earth) straight into the middle of an alien war, and before you know it, he's got just a few hours to save the world.""  As you can see, its a bit convoluted.  But that's kind of what makes it so much fun.  The film feels like you're tossed into part 18 of a 20 part serial, but haven't seen the first 17 pieces.  The plot is in there, though, and you can figure most things out if you see it more than once.  Its a pretty wild ride, with plenty of little jokes and weird things to see, so make sure you give it a couple chances.  Its great once you get it.

Spaceballs:  Mel Brooks' parody of Star Wars, with a few other references tossed in along the way.  Some of it is funny, some of it isn't.  Its not that its bad, but he's had better flicks.  Still, there are plenty of memorable scenes, so its worth checking out, but its no Young Frankenstein.  I loved it as a kid, but rarely have the desire to watch it now.  IMHO, the weakest of the three movies.

So there you have it, 3 movies for an excellent price, if you happen to pick it up used.  I did.  I got this for under two bucks!  Yikes!  A great value!",1337644800,10,2983,4.474953617810761
2839301,5,B000QQH52Y,"This package gets you three films (Spaceballs, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, and The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai) for less than it takes to buy two of them separately. Spaceballs is the funniest movie on the disc, and the best known.  The other two are reasonably amusing as well. If you're looking to get a hold of these movies, it's a really good deal.",1291248000,3,358,4.59375

8196864,4,B000QQH52Y,"Buckaroo Banzai makes it worth a purchase.  I admit it.  I thought Buckaroo Banzai was one of those out of the box, out of left field, either you get it or you don't movies that you either love or hate.  I loved Buckaroo Banzai.  I bought this collection because of it.  Spaceballs didn't do much for me.  Killer Klowns was campy and fun, but neither had staying power.  I watch Buckaroo Banzai every now and then and it still puts a smile on my face.  Amazing cast with Peter Weller, Clancy Brown, John Lithgow, and Jeff Goldblum.",1478476800,,531,4.402061855670103
