The differences are subtle.  Ram-Man is tall, rather than short.  Teela has longer hair, in a ponytail.  I think Cringer might not speak, or at least he didn't in this episode.  Still, I like the old series better.  I admit, maybe it's because the He-man and Prince Adam in the older version are sexier.  This episode has Prince Adam wanting to push aside his cowardly front and help out more as himself.  The episode has a big mystery as He-Man can't be beckoned if Prince Adam is locked up.  I think the youth will be entertained by this.  Still, I like the oldy-but-goody better.",1399075200,,733,4.596899224806202
8057022,2,B00093ET8W,"This isn't a bootleg... it's the Region 2 version (PAL), which seem to release some series before Region One (such as the Region 4 Smurf releases)

This is volume # 4 in the region 2 release of the series. It's okay, but only has a limited number of episodes on the disc. Unless if you have a region free dvd player, this DVD will not work for you.",1163376000,3,348,4.117647058823529
8057023,1,B00093ET8W,"This is obviously a bootleg product, because this series is not officially available on DVD yet. Save your money for when the real version comes out and don't enrich someone who knows how to make a DVD burner work.",1161907200,,214,4.512820512820513
8057024,5,B00093ET8W,"This video is a compilation of the series' first three episodes (""Diamond Ray of Disappearance"", ""Teela's Quest"", ""Colossor Awakes""), linked together within a wraparound sequence in which The Sorceress gives the viewers an introduction to the world of Eternia. great introduction into the world of Eternia. ""Diamond Ray of Disappearance"" and ""Teela's Quest"" may very well rank 1 and 2 in the series. The narration by the Sorceress is very well done, and adds drama and suspense to the storytelling. A great compilation.",1159315200,,519,5.265060240963855
