473178,5,6302403421,"Lenny Bruce was not ""dirty"". He did not tell dirty jokes. The reason he is still current is that is that he was truly funny. This does not mean that he wasn't also insightful and brilliant. It's just that he was able to translate it into comedy.

One thing that separates him from just about everyone who followed him is that he was spontaneous. He did not do the same routine exactly the same way twice. I believe that this is because he identified with jazz musicians. Comedians today generally recite their routines and hope for the best.

The result of this spontaneous feeling on the part of Lenny Bruce is that he has marvelous rapport with his audience. That is what you can experience when you watch this performance film.

Sometimes in his routines he will create dialogues between several characters - and you will believe you are witnessing their interaction. He has compassion. He can feel what others are experiencing.
Most critics miss the point. They usually do. They concentrate on everything but the essence. Lenny Bruce is funny. He likes to perform. He is a great performer.",1216166400,2,1093,4.742105263157895
473179,5,6302403421,"At the outset let me say that I am not a Lenny Bruce fan!
I remember seeing this film in the late 1970's at a midnight showing and not 'getting it'. It was not until sometime in the 1990's that I had an unquenchable desire to reconnect with Lenny Bruce only after I was given a copy of the double LP ""Live in Berkeley"".(Thank you Mr. Zappa!) That started an obsession for me with all things Lenny.
After having read LB's autobiography and most all of the other books, it was time to revisit this film. [BTW...The Trials of Lenny Bruce is a heavyweight; but essential reading if you can handle it. I must also highly recommend the 6 CD set titled ""Let The Buyer Beware""]
Now,forget about what other reviewers have written about ""a dying and broken man"" or that Lenny was drugged out!
I found this DVD to be 'the grail' as Lenny delivers cogent arguments to his detractors while also imparting some very funny material. In hindsight it's sad that Lenny's supporters could not do more to champion this prophet; but that's the way it was back in the mid 1960's. Sadly, the system took the 'fight' out of the man but could never take the man out of the 'fight'. Only Lenny could do that.
In closing let me restate that I highly recommend this to anyone who has done a little bit of 'under graduate' study of Lenny Bruce. Then, buy this DVD! As I said, I am not a fan of Lenny Bruce but a lover of this philosophical genius! Lenny Bruce was one of the greatest teachers of all time (and also one of the most honest and spiritual human beings) THANK YOU LENNY BRUCE!",1158624000,3,1559,4.342465753424658
473180,4,6302403421,"Although Lenny was near the end when this performance was filmed, he still puts on a riveting show. He does go on about the legal system a lot but what he says makes so much sense. You almost wish he could have used something like this in some of his courtroom defenses. He always said the prosecutors would do a ""bad"" Lenny Bruce in court! For people who assume he was constantly harrased and busted for his foul language, get a hold of this film and see how brilliant he was.",1138233600,2,477,4.252747252747253
473181,4,6302403421,"George Carlin says it best: Bruce's genius' was the unique ability to investigate hypocrisy and expose social inequities in a street rap that was really a form of poetry. In this--- the only complete stand-up performance of Bruce ever captured on film --- the iconoclast poet speaks. Loudly. Filmed in 1965 at San Francisco's Basin Street West (in what would be his penultimate live appearance), the show consists of Bruce's responses to the accusations and allegations stemming from his multiple arrests for obscenity and the trials that followed. While the production values are far from superior, it is an important piece of history for humorists and historians to embrace.",1135987200,5,676,5.2110091743119265
473182,4,6302403421,"I'm a Lenny Bruce fan.  I know about Lenny Bruce, and I know about 'The Lenny Bruce Performance Film'.  I know the circumstances under which the film was made, and the circumstances of Lenny's life and career at that time.  Consequently, my expectations for this performance were low.

But from the very start... he's good.  Not brilliant... but good.  Unfortunately, good is such a come-down for Lenny Bruce.  And the performance is not helped by the way it is filmed.  Lenny is never seen in full figure, which tends to be the best way to show stand-up.  The dim lighting was also as strong as Lenny's eyes could stand.

He looks rather chubbier than in his prime, and the trademark sharp suit has been replaced with looser clothes to hide his bulkier body.  But THIS IS Lenny Bruce performing on film, and it is because so little of this exists, this this film has the fascination it does.

Lenny is working with a document in hand - a transcript of one of his prosecutions - and the bulk of his performance revolves around what this contains...  How what he has said and done in nightclubs was misrepresented by the legal system of America.

And this main section of his performance works remarkably well.  He knows the points he wants to make, he easily find the sections of the transcript he needs, his vocal technique is still very much in evidence, and he is FUNNY.

But very soon, we see what is lacking in this Lenny Bruce.  The incisive mind may still be there, but the playfulness is gone.  While discussing the law, he talks about mime artists losing their ""freedom of speech"".  What an opportunity!  He misses what could have been one of the best laughs of the night.

But even this adequate performance can't be sustained.  The end is heart breaking.  An obligation of this performance was that Lenny reproduce some of the classic routines of just a few years earlier... and suddenly he tries.

Very sad.  He can't do it.  He can't reproduce his original passion or delivery of those bits.  Maybe he can't remember.  One routine lasts a few seconds, before he tries another.  Important lines we know should be there are missing.  Lenny is clearly in trouble.

It is like watching one of those ""peace officers"" he earlier criticizes for hopelessly trying to portray Lenny Bruce the performer in court.  Without the real Lenny Bruce speaking, these famous routines quietly die a death.

Eventually the performance dwindles to a close.  Lenny goes to a side door, and improvises some lines to passers-by.  We can't really hear what he is saying, and it seems embarrassing to try.  After a minute or so, the door allows his escape.

This was Lenny's next to last nightclub performance.  Within a year he will be dead.",1133654400,13,2728,4.665263157894737
473183,4,6302403421,"For any Lenny Bruce fan, this film is absolutely essential. It is the only time in his all-too-brief career that Lenny's nightclub act was filmed from begining to end.

This is Lenny at the end of his life. It is August of 1965 and he has less than a year to live. The effects of four years of unrelenting persecution and personal self destruction are painfully evedent. He's not the Lenny of 1959: The hyper-energetic, brilliant young comic who burst apon the national consciousness with two riotous appearances on the Steve Allen Show. By the summer of 1965 it is obvious to even the most casual of viewers that Lenny Bruce is a broken, dying man.

And yet, even in this tragic condition, he is still screamingly funny. Some people have criticized his obsession with the American legal system during this period as ponderous and rambling. But when viewed within the context of historical  hindsight and a knowledge of his own personal saga, Lenny's observations are fresh and eye opening.

A writer from Newsweek once refered to Lenny Bruce as ""a sad, sick, self destructive genius of a dirty time"". This film is an important document that records what it was that made him so unique.

473184,3,6302403421,"The sound and picture quality of the tape make it difficult to keep up with Lenny's rapid-fire delivery.  I took from this movie a sense of Lenny's style and mannerisms, but had difficulty feeling ""part of the audience.""  To be sure, Lenny's brilliance and desperation are on full display, but the routine is less comedic and more a polemical declaration of free speech.  I rather think that How to Talk Dirty and Influence People gave me a much clearer view of Mr. Bruce's philosophies, insights, and style than did seeing him on this tape.",1017100800,7,541,4.73404255319149
473185,2,6302403421,"As a die-hard fan of Lenny who was born after his death, I must warn those that in this he strictly just goes over his court problems and doesn't do routines or bits.",995932800,8,166,4.0606060606060606
473186,5,6302403421,"The best reason for buying this live concert video has been tucked away after the credits: ""Thank You Mask Man"" is director Jeff Hale's seven-minute animation of the voice track from one of Lenny's nightclub gigs. [Among classic cartoons, this one is right up there with ""Bambi Meets Godzilla"" (ASIN 6300229386).] In ""The Essential Lenny Bruce"" (ASIN 0333136160), our hero reflects on the significance of a masked man who avoids gratitude:
I always wonder about the anonymous giver. Cause the anonymous giver truly is the egomaniac: ""I'm so GOOD--I'm not going to tell ANYbody."" That's sick, man. I'm going to leave you with this, that the only anonymous giver is the guy that knocks up your daughter.",971049600,17,701,5.0

7826669,5,6302403421,"There was so little film shot of Lenny's standup it's almost criminal, there are more recordings but still an insufficient body of work to represent his contributions to the field of improvisation, standup and just plain straight observation, perhaps true reality.

""I'm not trying to be funny, this is how I see things"" was Lenny's explanation.

Societys knee jerk reaction to anything it doesn't understand, and the jail time he received for speaking his mind to people that not only wanted to hear but paid to hear his thoughts.

I was expelled from school when they found that I attended every performance I could get to, ahaa my Chicago of the 50's & 60's

The Performance Film is of reasonably good quality for a ""live filming / recording"" in a nightclub, especially considering the rather crude emerging technologies of the day, and unfortunately this is about all there is of Lenny....",1358380800,,893,4.894039735099338
7826670,2,6302403421,"Lenny Bruce was at about the end of his rope when this performance was filmed. By that time, he appeared on stage with a court manuscript talking about all of the mistakes the peace officer made who wrote down his act and used his notes as evidence of Lenny's obscenity. Bruce was ultimately found guilty on that evidence and this film was Bruce's rebuttal to the verdict.

Unfortunately, the performance is not funny. Funny is Lenny Live at Carnegie Hall, his albums and the ""Thank You Masked Man"" cartoon included on this DVD. If you are familiar with Bruce's work before seeing this you will likely be filled with little more than just sadness at the sight of what years of legal problems did to a funny man.

It's a good historical document and if you want laughs, at least the cartoon is funny but you will find much better examples of Lenny Bruce the comic in all of his glory on his albums and the exhaustive box set ""Let The Buyer Beware""",1345852800,4,946,4.46242774566474
7826671,4,6302403421,"Starting with the Dustin Hoffman movie Lenny I've been fascinated by this comic.  His biography by Goldman does a complete dive into Bruce's life including discussing all of his famous bits in detail giving great context as to why they were funny at the time.  I also highly recommend the book Honey about his wife who was truly fascinating.

Now, as to this performance within a year of his death.  First, all readings talk of how terrible he looked and how heavy.  Sorry, I didn't see it.  Looked pretty normal to me. Not in shape but not a slob like so often is portrayed.  Having listened to a few of his records and been umimpressed with the comedy, I would say that this is as good a recording as you can expect from this period of time.  Is this hilarious?  No.  Does it drone on about his legal proceedings? yes, but admittedly, he does present a logical argument while trying to incorporate fun.

I love the theory of Lenny Bruce.  But he won't change lives by listening to this performance.  My opinion is you have to have lived during that time and ""felt"" the oppressive society to really understand the genius of Lenny Bruce.  overall, I'm glad I watched and agree that the Masked Man six minute comic strip at the end is worth the watch.  Enjoy.  I did.",1337472000,2,1266,4.462882096069869
7826672,5,6302403421,"There are two ways to look at this 1965 San Fransisco performance, one of the last by great Lenny Bruce. A master improviser or an addict reeling out of control.

By 1965 Bruce was almost bankrupt from legal fights over his material. Much worse he had a strong addiction to heroin. In a year he would be dead.

His legal struggles became the main content of his stand-up: he would work on stage from court transcripts. There were moments of  brilliance, and chuckles, but the all encompassing social humor that made Bruce famous, and invoked roaring laughter, was gone. Bruce was angry, broken, sick, and insular.

Still, this film does show Bruce's ability to connect loosly associated topics and think on his feet: there are moments here so scadalogical, so amazing in Bruces' abstract thinking, that you can still see what made him great.

This is not Bruce at his best, but historically and just to see a genius work, this is essental to watch.",1283126400,2,948,4.721212121212122
7826673,4,6302403421,"In the one-hour 1965 video originally called simply ""Lenny Bruce,"" a clearly distracted Lenny thumbs through a NY court transcript and recreates bits that during his trial were misquoted, misinterpreted and maligned. Occasional audience giggles are heard, but only after vulgarities. His listeners are obviously not attuned to Bruce's concerns. Selfishly or otherwise, they want to be entertained.

After some amusement over a mime group arrested in a park, Lenny talks of his three obscenity busts and using the transcript as a guide he performs major portions of these routines: T & A, Jackie Kennedy fleeing the limo, Judaism, cheating and male arousal (doing it with a chicken), urinating in the sink and off a ledge, the flasher. Bruce asserts the prosecution's statement that his ""monologues insulted sex, debased it"" has totally confused what is prurient with what is art, and thus this conclusion is legally and logically flawed.

Setting aside the papers, Lenny closes with a 20 minute free-association pastiche of his better-known material mixed with random thoughts. In rapid order he covers Alaska, the decorative stone wall behind him, Chicago mobsters disrupting Shelley Berman's act, a Miami Beach heckler who hit Bruce with a wine glass and the bouncer's retaliation, narcotics, a lengthy recreation of the Father Flotsky prison movie, "" 'to' is a preposition, 'come' is a verb."" His closing thought is about jealous men.

For any fan of this tortured genius, ""Lenny Bruce"" is a must-see. And for those who enjoy Richard Pryor, George Carlin or Robin Williams, you'll experience here the last flickers of brilliance from the man who inspired them to become comedians. Highly recommended.",1263427200,4,1703,5.276752767527675
