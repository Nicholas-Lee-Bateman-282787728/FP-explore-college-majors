8228746,4,B000XMW7QK,"I have used this series of videos with my seventh grade students.  They present information about the different world religions in a concise manner.  Very understandable and associated vocabulary is flashed up on the screen which is great, and helps the students with note taking. The beginning and ending of the videos with the groups of students performing different types of community service are a little hokey, but the students are always curious to see what they are doing next.",1358553600,,484,5.0375
