8478729,2,B005LXI76U,Loved that it came early. Just not big on the fourth and fifth movies of prophecy the others were action packed and had great fights these were more plot and human analysing.,1381363200,,174,4.46875
8478730,4,B005LXI76U,"If you are looking at these because you liked Christopher Walken in the first three movies, you will be disappointed.  However, if you are looking for further stories about the interaction of angels in rebellion and humans, these are a pair of very good stories.  Think of it as more stories in the same universe by a completely different author, but still it is an author who gets the universe, and had a new story to tell.
I found the story of Prophecy 4 and 5 to be spookily good, enough to recommend to a friend.
The filming is done on a budget, and not all the actors are as good as in the first few films (although Jason Scott Lee is pretty good in his role).  For a B-grade film, it is worth viewing.",1341705600,2,707,4.222222222222222
8478731,1,B005LXI76U,"These have been simply transferred onto blu ray disc with no change of pq or aq. Not worth buying again.
Too bad because i love the films themselves.
I thought there would at least be some improvement because the dvds look terrible but no go.",1324512000,4,242,4.4
