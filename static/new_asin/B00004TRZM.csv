Mel's method is so simple and so ""productive"" that you will want to make as many gardens as possible!  It's that simple... Check it out!",991958400,6,303,5.02
7923073,4,B00004TRZM,"This video seemed more like a book promotion than a thorough video.  We actually got his first three video series from the library.  Then I thought I could get all the material in one video.  Although it's great for a quick overview of the system, which in itself is wonderful, I don't think it gives as thorough explanation as given in the original 3 videos.  It was only 30 minutes long.  Each of the other video's were over 50.  My kids and I have all decided we'd much rather have copies of the first three.  It's still a good video if you want an overview of the system and have gotten the book.",991958400,20,600,4.256637168141593
7923074,5,B00004TRZM,"I had read Mel Bartholomew's book ""Square Foot Gardening"" and was amazed at the simplicity of how Mel and Suzy explained how to do this unique gardening method.  I especially enjoyed the simplified soil mixture  ""Mel's Mix"" over the program of improving my existing soil.  After watching the video I was renewed to go out and garden.",958694400,17,333,4.807017543859649
