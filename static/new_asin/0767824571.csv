23007,5,0767824571,"This is an exceptionally great movie(the best movie of all time in my opinion). This movie was hilarious. The laughs were relentless, they never stopped. I am an enormous fan of the Pythons, but you don't need to have  even heard of them to enjoy this movie(or any of thier other work for that  matter). The bottom line is see this movie. Many, many, many times.
The  best movie from the best comedy troup in the world.
And that leaves only  one question: What is the air speed velocity of an unlaiden swallow?",911606400,,510,4.451612903225806

23067,5,0767824571,"Monty Python has always been one of my family's favorite British comedy groups. My family's favorite quote from the movie is ""I fart in your general direction."" I purchased this movie because we only had a VHS copy. The DVD copy I purchased may be older, but it still contains a quality film with many fun extras. My personal favorite extra is the sing along versions of the songs.",1521936000,,381,4.536231884057971

23082,5,0767824571,"I didn't buy this for the castle box and catapult, but I have to admit, it provided a few minutes of fun. Getting to the disc itself can be a little bit tedious: you have to remove the plastic sleeve around the box, then you open the box, then you slide out an inner box, then you remove the outer Blu-ray case sleeve, then you slide off the outer box on the case, and finally you're faced with the actual, plastic, standard Blu-ray case... but you're not done yet, because it's got a latch on the side that has to be opened before you can open the case and get to the disc. If I didn't know better, I'd say this was part of a Python joke. But once you're in, you get a great film transfer. I prefer the old mono sound, because I can tell that they remixed the music and re-recorded the voice-overs on the 5.1 audio. You've seen most of the special features before if you have the 2-disc DVD special edition, but there are a couple of new things on here from 2015. All in all, it is worth the money, and I'm quite satisfied.",1520467200,,1024,4.125

23084,5,0767824571,"The Monty Python TV series is somewhat uneven, but their best stuff is usually very funny and often hilarious.  That's the case with this movie.  Overall, it's highly entertaining and very funny, sometimes laugh out loud funny, always enjoyable.  If you are easily offended you may not like it.  On the other hand, if you're easily offended you probably have no interest in Monty Python anyway.  A few people complained about the black knight, I thought it was hilarious, but I have a ""dark"" sense of humor.  If you've watched and enjoyed ""Monty Python's Flying Circus,"" you will most likely enjoy this movie.",1519776000,,609,4.864077669902913
23085,2,0767824571,I was surprised at the language and the frequent use of the F word.  I was hoping to show this classic to my 10 year old grandkids but will not be doing that.  Now that I'm 65 having never seen the complete film I found it to less funny that the few clips they normally show.  As with most film previews in 2 minutes they can show all the funny parts of the film.,1519776000,,363,3.8783783783783785

23090,5,0767824571,"This steelbook release of the remastered Monty Python film ""The Holy Grail"" is a treat for fans.  Not only is steelbook itself beautiful to behold but the blu ray itself has great picture and sound quality and is a definite upgrade from the previous old release.  There is also a good documentary included featuring Terry Jones and Graham Chapman.  For me personally this is the best of the Python films and is still funny today and I feel Gilliam only did better on ""Brazil"".

Great picture and sound quality and a great comedy makes this an easy recommendation.

I've seen this far too many times and each time there's something else silly I pick up that makes me laugh.. Some of the humor is so general and childish that this is ALMOST a kid-friendly film, and then you get to Castle Anthrax and it's definitely NOT for kids (same thing with the goofy fake violence and bright-red blood spurting out of dismembered limbs. Keep it to older viewers.) Stands up well with time as a comedy classic.",1486857600,,641,4.487179487179487

23447,5,0767824571,"MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL tis but a great film!

Review stated by: Grant Elmore , A.K.A.  Simply Overcomplicated Reviews

Do you seek the thrill of quest? Doest thou enjoy the tales of the round table? Do you want to see a dramatic interpretation of the King Arthur tales? (well this probably is not the movie for that) After having watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail , I thought it only fair to review it!

Set in Medieval Place near, um, Camelot... ya we will go with that. We follow the Great-ish King Arthur (Graham Chapman) on his holy quest, to find the grail! On his travels he will run into Lancelot (John Cleese), The Black Knight (John Cleese), Tim the Enchanter (John Cleese), Bedivere (Terry Jones), Prince Herbert (Terry Jones), God (Graham Chapman), and many more. Watch in amazement as these people actually get some things accomplished like: collecting a shrubbery, bringing out your dead, chopping limbs off, and many various random tasks in MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL !

Portraying the great King Arthur is none other than Graham Chapman, a lovely actor who has various quotable lines and an iconic personality. If you don't quite understand what I mean you simply have to watch this movie. There is not much to say in means of acting and oscar worthy performances. In fact, this movie truly defines a whole new way to look at acting. (You probably didn't expect such a deep review on such a film). John Cleese is of these iconic acting performances playing such characters as Tim and The Black Knight. If I were to praise any talent above the rest it would have to be him. This man played so many various characters and did each one just as well as the rest. Every word he said in this movie has to have been quoted hundreds of times. Look at the title of my review for instance Tis but a great film, using the line from the film, Tis but a flesh wound. A moment so great I will do you the favor of not spoiling it. If I had to choose one character that I felt fell short, it would have to be the cow hurdled at the knights of the round table. I felt his performance didn't leave much of an impact and I didn't feel like he had much meat to his character. The performance in other words was an utter disappointment.

My personal favorite part of this movie is the humor. The humor can fit a variety of audiences anywhere between teen-adult (preferably) with lines such as You must spank her well and after you have spanked her you may do with her as you like and then spank me. and You must bring me, A SHRUBBERY. I find this movie to be the hardest to find something bad about, but I would have to say the end credits.

I suppose you expect me to write now about a moral/theme or what I have learned. I would say life tis but a flesh wound.

I would recommend this film for anyone in search of a great comedy. This film in towards the audience of older teen to adult simply for some mild sexual references including the words oral sex being stated. This film is rated PG but is more formatted to the PG-13 audience.

SCALE: EL~LAME- GRANTTASTIC
I would say this movie is GRANTTASTIC",1486512000,,3118,4.389948006932409
23448,5,0767824571,"In all honesty, this is a film that shall stand the test of time: a foundation, the bedrock upon which future comedies will build their empires.

I thought it was hilarious then and now that I am able to get every reference in the movie. I loved it even more. Monty Python's movies are so funny. I love them. I got this movie for my dad as a birthday present. I think it was his favorite comedy movie also. I was extra excited when I got it and saw that thru December you can add the ultraviolet code included in the box. I can't wait to add it to my vudu collection. I love the stupidity of the times of Camelot, Monty Python makes this so can't stop watching it. I believe I will be purchasing his other movies also. I forgot how funny they were and also I am thinking of trying to find my dad Bennie Hill.",1477353600,,775,3.9743589743589745

Certainly Monty Python humor is not for everyoneit requires a patience for comedy and a delight in absurdity.  But for those with these cultivated tastes in sketch humor, this movie is both a crowning and a clowning achievement.  I personally laugh uncontrollably through most of the movie and find myself debating with other viewers as to what are the funniest bits in the moviethe taunting insults of Norman castle guards (Your mother is a hamster!), the attempts to use medieval logic to construct a witch-test, the strange demands of the Knights Who Say Nee (for a shrubbery), the Holy Hand Grenade (my current favorite), or the Three Questions asked by the Bridge Keeper at the Bridge of Deaththese are all unforgettable routines at the very apex of comedy.

I thought to myself, what am I supposed to do?  I can't watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail whenever I want to anymore?  We had a family copy of the movie from a long time ago, but I had no idea where it was or who had it.  My only option was to buy my very own copy.  I rarely buy movies, but this one is worth it.  My first memory of it is from when I was 9 or 10 years old.  I pretended to think it was funny so my siblings would think I was cool.

Since then, and hundreds of viewings later, this is one of my all time favorite movies.  I just watched it again last week and found something new in it that I'd never noticed before.  The movie came quickly in perfect conditions.  Happiness is had multiple times a month as a result.

All in all very entertaining.",1461196800,,292,4.745098039215686
24134,4,0767824571,"In the 1970s Hollywoods economic crisis gave way to a number of low budget blockbusters.  These low budget films, when successful, brought millions back in box office revenue.  The 70s gave way to some of the most memorable films in Hollywoods history: one of them being Terry Gilliam & Terry Jones Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  The humorous retelling of King Arthurs search for the Holy Grail made the best out of a small budget and still stands out to many as one of the best films from the 70s.
 Stylistically, Monty Python and the Holy Grail doesnt seem like a huge leap forward upon first glance.  The film, like many other movies of the same time period, took some of its inspiration from famous literature; primarily the stories of King Arthur and his Knights of the Roundtable influenced the plot of the quest for the grail and the characters.  The film was shot on location at multiple different locations across the United Kingdom and aerial shots were cleverly used to give us a sense of being among the castle walls looking down upon the knights as they conversed with guards.  Necessity also gave way to the actors playing multiple roles in the film, Michael Palin playing the most characters at 12.
 Editing in Monty Pythons Holy Grail used one of the newly popular techniques in filmmaking at the time: parallel editing.  Two separate events, occurring at the same time are shown back-to-back to show that these events are occurring at the same time but in a different space.  Transitions also hold a major role in the style Holy Grail presents.  A storybook motif is used at a point to move the story along, as well are a number of animations drawn stylistically to resemble illuminated manuscripts of medieval times, and the use of a narrator (whom is introduced as quickly as departs).
As a comedy the humor in Monty Python and the Holy Grail had to stand out against other comedies of the time in order to mark it as a film worth remembering.  Monty Pythons writers imbue The Holy Grail with their unique brand of humor that was accessible to a wide variety of audiences.  Their humor also made comments on issues and made the mundane humorous.
Even the credit sequence itself, taking its inspiration from Igmar Bergmans foreign films, uses the credits and the subtitles in a humorous context.  The credits begin to argue with themselves (over the humorous addition of inaccurate Swedish subtitles making jokes about a mse and then further jokes related to llamas).  Some of the prop related humor was a direct result of the small budget the film had to work from.  Real horses were unaffordable which gave way to coconut halves being used akin to radio sound effect production.  The result, though born of necessity, made the film all the more memorable.
The humor in Monty Python and the Holy Grail ranges greatly from simple slapstick like humor to political and social satirical humor.  They used the opportunity to let their humor make comments on politics (Arthurs conversation with the man and woman digging through the filth), common sense & mass hysteria (the trial of the Witch), society, and religion (the monks hitting themselves with planks of wood).  Films in the late 60s and the 70s had a habit of taking on a political undertone and Monty Pythons Holy Grail doesnt disappoint in that aspect.
 Holy Grails shining moments however may lie in how it questions continuity and the concept of stories existing in their own world separate from our own.  Dialog continuity is made into a joke numerous times as characters have multiple side conversations unrelated to the plot, and plot continuity itself is questioned with the sudden intermission alluding to theatrical performances and with the films abrupt ending giving no sign of a resolution.  The 4th wall, which usually contains a story within itself, counting the audience as just viewers; broken numerous times in Holy Grail for humorous effect.  Characters will address to the audience, make comments about set models, acting, scenes, etc. even sometimes prompting the other actors to tell them to Get on with it.  The sudden introduction of the narrator even breaks the 4th wall since he becomes part of the story and is killed off in a matter of seconds (the animator of the animated transitions and the monster they face in the cave suffers a similar fate).
 Overall, while the quality of the film at first might appear like it is nothing special, the content is what really drives it home.",1461110400,,4486,4.817470664928292

24603,4,0767824571,"This is a very silly film.

 It is a film about the Arthurian search for the Holy Grail, and involves many fantastic events that relate to this search: an appearance by God, sorcerers, evil knights, three headed giants, a many-eyed beast, a vicious killer rabbit, etc.

 But more subtly than that it also involves a fantasy element which is not often discussed, and sometimes misunderstood. Danny Peary, for examples indicates that the movie is actually the result of a group of filmmakers that do not have a budget for horses, forgot to get permission to film from the local authorities and in their zeal to tell the story manage to kill a historian narrator.

 I do not think that this is correct at all.

 There are plenty of other examples that use similar fantastic premises to tell their own stories. For example, there is a Twilight Zone episode in which a Western actor manages to get caught inside an alternate reality that somehow emerges from his experiences filming movies and ends up in the real West (not a particularly good episode, I'll admit.) TZ also brings us parallel worlds in which mannequins or dolls have their own reality, parallel, but independent of normal, human reality, and which sometimes intrude upon one another.

Another instance of something similar is Cline et Julie vont en bateau (1974) in which our two leading ladies somehow get caught inside a ghost story that is being played/acted out. They retain their memories of who they are outside of the ghost story and mess around with the ghost story events as they play out.

Another instance has already been mentioned on the site and is probably the direct inspiration for the Pythons. Start the Revolution Without Me (1970) also features a narrator getting killed by the events he is attempting to report.

More recently The Lego Movie also shows similar  parallel realities: the toy perspective reality and the god-like perspective of the child playing with them.

 But the Pythons themselves had already played around with a similar concept. In a sketch a constable attempting to catch a ring of pornographers goes undercover in Edwardian  Elizabethan dress only to be caught/transported to Edwardian  Elizabethan  times. his identity becomes confused about who he is, and eventually he returns to modern times.

 I think the only way to interpret this movie is to see that the Arthurian events are, somehow, just as real as the parallel, modern instances of an intruding modern world of historian/narrators and investigating police. The low-budget documentarian explanation does not really make sense, as it does not explain why murder would happen, or how the instances of fantastic intervention of God, sorcerers or fabulous monsters could happen. At the very least, all the scenes presenting multiple performers acting out scenes of medieval life would have to be explained via the use of extremely sincere madmen as actors. Other fabulous events would simply go unexplained.",1446422400,,2970,5.03680981595092

This box set is way over-priced for just including a flimsy catapult set that you have to get exactly right or it won't fire. The novelty wears off quickly because the catapult sucks so much.  I tried to ambush my grown daughter with it, yet the cow flew backwards and hit me. Hard to put away once you attach the catapult correctly, and I was afraid disassembling it constantly would wear out the cardboard.

The film is old so it is quite grainy on Blu-ray, so no real improvement of picture quality.  There is only one disk.  Not a lot of extras for the price.  Just buy a regular DVD of the movie.

24729,5,0767824571,"This is a fun movie and they didn't take themselves too seriously when making it.  I find when watching this in older versions backing things up just to see particular scenes over again, or remembering my initial reactions as the outright silliness that they brought forth.  A fun movie to watch and have when life just gets too serious.  The only issue is it a catapult or was it a cowtapult?  I've seen so much weird stuff in my time sometimes things blur together a bit.",1441152000,8,473,4.465116279069767
24740,5,0767824571,"I cannot review this particular edition and all the extras.  I would like to be able to, but as it is not yet released, it would require not only a time machine, but more money than I am willing to spend for a movie on Blu-Ray that I've got two copies of alreadym plus another on DVD.

However, I would dearly love to see the interview with John Oliver, the instruction video on how to use coconuts, and play with the catapult and rubber animals.  ""RUN AWAY!  RUN AWAY!""

But the five stars are for the movie itself, and I would have given it ten stars if it were permitted.  This may be the funniest movie ever made by anyone anywhere, its only real competition being the later Peter Sellers' Pink Panther (""Return of..."" and ""Revenge of..."")  movies and other movies by Monty Python, particularly ""Life of Brian"" and ""The Meaning of Life.""  (Well, and another little movie that seems to tickle my funnybone more than it does most other people, ""Soapdish."")

So many things in this movie have entered the modern vernacular.  ""Filthy English Knight"" (pronounced as it is spelled, ""Kanigget"").  ""Wot, th' curtains?""  The aforementioned ""RUN AWAY!""  ""It's just a flesh wound.""  ""I fart in your general direction.""  Etc., etc., etc.

I don't think I have ever busted a gut laughing as hard as I did the first time I saw the ""Bring out your dead"" scene.  If you've never seen this movie, I suggest that you leave the ascetic cloisters (where you chant ""Pies Iesu Domine, Dona eis Requiem"" and bang your head with boards of wood) and come back to the world, as fearsome as this modern world may be, because some things like this movie are well worth the trouble.",1440720000,8,1657,4.562711864406779

25034,5,0767824571,"There are certain movies that become more than just movies and attain a lofty cult status. This is one of those movies, and with good reason. To say that John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Michael Palin etc. are brilliant may be an understatement.

The story is quite simple, Graham Chapman who plays Arthur, King of the Britons, goes in seach of The Holy Grail. We get the idea that The Grail is some sort of holy cup. He enlists a cast of characters to help him get it.

There are so many great scenes here including:
The opening scene where Arthur and company is making the sound of a galloping horse which is really just the banging of 2 coconuts together.

Or what about the Knights Who Say Nei? Get me a shrubberry!

Or the Killer Rabbitt? Priceless!

Or the fight with the Knight. His arm is lobbed off but he says ""It's just a flesh wound!""

Or The Bridge of Death? What is the speed of an African swallow (that's African not European)?
You have to know these things when you're King you know.

This is one of the funniest movies ever. Those who like this movie will also like John Cleese's series called
Fawlty Towers. Those who don't like it must bring me... Another Shrubbery!",1428278400,,1181,4.439814814814815

I thought it was so funny.  The first time I saw it I laughed so very hard at some parts.  There is some silly comedy that is bordering on dumb but that's what comedy movies must do, strive for any laugh no matter how small.  It;s hard not to love these characters even the bit roles.

Here they put their imprint on the myth of the 'holy grail' which ostensibly was the search for the holy chalice which ties back into Christian legend.
With hilarious skits and sketches about the 'black knight', the idiot prince having an arranged marriage, court hijinks, endless combat and immaculate chivalrous behavior, we get the typical Monty Pythonesque fast-paced action.  What is remarkable about them is that they made so much from so little.  The great bit about the Black Knight is only a few minutes and is rather grim, yet it's silly and fun in keeping with the overall theme.

I saw this film in the College Town Cinema of Glassboro in 1975 and after thirty nine years, I can safely say that it is indeed a cult classic. It will bust your guts as it is a dynamite of unheard of humour. This group is made up of geniuses. Right from its opening collage of titles in various languages to the arrest of the entire Dark Ages crew by current day bobbies has made this unique in its expression of biting humour. This production comes down hard on English dynasties and reverence of both Protestant and Catholic rituals. The pythons have really put their fangs through the legends of King Arthur with their one-liners and slapstick. The Knights of the Round Table go out in pursuit of the Holy Grail on foot and you will fall off your seat when you hear the sounds of the horses' hooves with lackeys making sound with coconut shells like clippety clop. The plague ridden communities with phrases like `bring out your dead' is extremely hilarious with healthy citizens also being thrown on to the pile of dead bodies. Taunts like `I will fart in your general direction' and `I will wave my private parts at your aunties' are simply mind-blowing additions. The cinematic style is surreal while being outrageously stunning its visuals. The members of the Monty Python Group have to be lauded and acknowledged and they are - John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Graham Chapman and Terry Jones. Jack Trombey has written the fantastic and epic music to this zany masterpiece.",1412380800,,1515,4.742424242424242

But Amazon Instant Video removed it recently (June 2014) so it's not available to watch via Roku.  We purchased it via Amazon Instant Video and our Prime membership as a trial to see how well it worked purchasing a movie to be held ""in the cloud"" in April, 2013.

I thought it was going to be just as funny as ""Life of Brian"" but I ended up being disappointed. As for the video quality, there were a few segments of the film that looked a little blotchy and not sufficiently enhanced to be considered a ""Blu-Ray"" quality movie.

25276,4,0767824571,"This movie is meant to make fun of the legends of King Arthur and the Holy Grail, and has proven to be wildly popular.  But be warned...this is not nice family entertainment.  Indeed, it shows the Middle Ages as ugly, filthy, and gruesome.  There is violent bloodshed and people dying of plagues.  Indeed, perhaps the funniest line is how one peasant can recognize the king: ""He doesn't have [excrement] all over him!""

The movie often veers into random silliness, in part due to budgetary concerns.  The budget didn't allow real horses to be used, so people rapping coconut shells together substituted for the sound of horseback riding.  A chase stops when ""the animator died of a heart attack"".  Not all jokes work, but many do.  However, be warned...the movie is gruesome and ugly, so don't watch this with your wife and kids.",1407024000,,829,4.78169014084507

25290,1,0767824571,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail, the film that everyones seen a million times! The Knights of Ni! The Bridge Of Death!  Bring out your dead! The Camelot song! Castle Anthrax! Swamp Castle and Herbert and Luckys wedding! Coconuts! French soldiers in Britain (mind you own beeswax!)! The Black Knight! The Three-headed Knight! Insane animated bits! Tim the Enchanter! The RABBIT!!!! The intermissions organ music! Even the opening credits are brilliant!! Love the Anglo Amalgamated Bertram Ostrer film Dentist on the Job fake film starting it all off just to screw with our heads, heh heh Dreem toothpaste for me! Credits signed by Richard M Nixon. Reference to moose in credits! Flashing red and green!! Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. You cant expect to hold supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you. I mean, if I went round saying I was an emperor because some moistened bink had lobbed a scimitar at me, theyd put me away. King Arthurs sword fight the crappiest ever. We are now the Knights Who Say Ekke Ekke Ptang Zoo Boing!

Not many films have these many bonus features, so this review is more a review of those items than of the film itself  there are already several bonus features on the first disc (the two commentaries, etc), while the second disc is devoted to them.

The first disc has a very long and awesome animated opening, showing the king, the many-eyed monster, flags, opening vaults, angels, splitting clouds, angels flying, more clouds, and the Grail, of course. Scene selections with some animation and sound. Disc One says that it has extras, but its only a bit of animation, and the text to see the extras insert disc 2; no, into your DVD player. Yes whatever  Audio and subtitles, more animation, with the options of Screenplay: Read as you watch!, English, French, Spanish, For people who do not like the film (taken form Henry IV Pt. II, by William Shakespeare), and if you linger on the menu you hear a voice say get on with it!! In the audio, you get a few options, plus commentaries: Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, or John Cleese and Eric Idle and Michael Palin. Hmmm intriguing! Theres a follow the killer rabbit feature you can turn on or off, so that whenever the white rabbit appears on your screen press enter on your remote or click with your mouse and you will either see into the mind of Terry Gilliam or learn the financial secrets of the accountants version. Interesting and more on that later. Of course, what you actually get is a sketch of King Arthurs hand on his first riding into the scene, an accounting rabbit that shows how much the production crew paid for mud in the bring out your dead scene. Helmets and swords for the black knight fight scene cost 500. Sketches from witch-burning scene. Parsnip and string for witch-burning scene cost 0.22. Petty cash voucher for meals for extras (2 per person, 35 individuals). Camelot castle cutout plywood cost 40. Sketches for Terry Giliams God animation. Model cow for French castle, 19. Other animals, 9. Other sketches and photos. Wood for Trojan rabbit 50. Horse and rider for two hours, 5 per hour, to ride past historian. Springboarding monks sketch. Medieval maidens costumes rental. The madmans make-up. Snuck into Hampstead Heath to film the Lancelot attack wedding scene. Lunches for wedding guests and five pints of Kensington gore. Crone and her warts. Sketches for Roger the Shrubber scene. Crazy frozen land of Nador animation. Rental of stuffed rabbit, rental of rabbit puppet, cleaning blood off of cave. Memo to self: insure holy hand grenade. Rabbit cave and holy hand grenade scene sketches (on bloody rabbit icon). The Black Beast of Aaaaaaargggghhhh sketches. Bridge of Death sketches; invoice for Bridge of Death items. Sketches and shots of the final boat and castle scene. Invoice for shearing of putrid sheep and a bottle of whiskey (prop man). Invoice for 80 student lunches and sketches of final pikemen sequence. Hire of police light, 4.50.

The hard of hearing part reads out the menu itself (useless, no?). The King Henry IV Pt. II subtitles are probably not accurate, and roughly follow the action of the play. tis Gaultree Forest. Hanging on Hotspurs neck. I feel happy becomes Happy am I. Mention of Falstaff

Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones commentary  the American voice and the British voice  Terry Jones dressed as a woman (?), changing into his cow costume, Gilliam would change into womens clothing (the two don't seem to be in the same room at the same time); ast least thats the scene that they set, and well have to take their words for it. Fun with subtitles and titles the first time they showed it to audiences they couldn't believe it; the cheapskate opening captions also happened because theyd run out of money and needed to eat up time. By maintaining a very low production standard, you can get away with murder; its always dangerous when you try to make good proper films, and you cant really do these kind of jokes, says Gilliam, who by now has worked with large budgets. Costume and setting is 14th century, but Arthurian legends are told in the 14th century about the 10th century. In the opening castle scene youd find one of the busiest traffic spots in London, in Hamstead Heath, directly behind the camera, Terry Gilliam acts as Patsy. All castles in the film are Dune Castle, from different angles. They question the authenticity of having everyone filthy with missing teeth, etc. Lack of close-ups, filming too fast, too primitively, too ambitious to have too many gags in it. Watery tart scene written by all Monty Python members. Black Knight scene shot in Epping Forest. John Cleese (Black Knight) and Terry Gilliam (Green Knight) learned sword fighting for this scene. Took a week to shoot the scene, with no budget. The scene didn't work when edited, so they spliced in scenes of John/Black Knight not speaking and it was fine. Tried dubbing the Black Knight lines with other voices. In New York at the opening, the Vietnam war was on, people were anti-war, didn't find it funny. Hired a one-legged man to do the final leg of the Black Knight. The last leg goes off a puppet. First head-banging monk is Neil Innes. Always obsessed with monks and flagellation and self-abuse. The witch is played by Connie Booth, John Cleeses wife at the time. Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film is said to be Tom (actually, William) Palin. Neil Innes was the seventh Python. The photo of God was WG Grace, one of Britains most famous cricketers. John Belushi and Gilda Radner were at the New York opening and introduced themselves to Terry Gilliam. Terry Jones talks about putting the script together. Terry Gilliam talks about how Monty Python came together. At the BBC, once a show was green-lighted, the cast were left to their own devices. But after four episodes they were almost cancelled, because the execs didn't understand the weird humour, but by that time it was too late  critics and fans loved them! Terry Jones talks about horrendous meetings that they would have trying to decide what to call the troupe and their show. The Horses Spoon and a Basin, Owl Stretching Time, The Toad Elevating Moment, and they settled on Bun Whacket Buzzet Stubble and Boot. The BBC said No, this is stupid, you cant name it something like that. They had a working title Circus, Eric Idle suggested Gwen Dibbleys Flying Circus. Maybe our whole show should be like Terrys animations! Terry Gilliam is the blind soothsayer lunatic who cackles. The Knights who say Ni was always the funniest scene when they discussed and rehearsed it, but they had trouble filming it. George Harrison said that Monty Python were the spirit of the Beatles continuing, since they started the year the Beatles stopped. No ad-libbing, all scripted and rehearsed, so they could shoot quickly (later Eric Idle mentions that he ad-libbed one line into the Bring out your dead scene). Terry Gilliam talks about the difficulty of co-directing, having been a secluded animator, and how Terry Jones launched a re-think of knights roles in society from gentlemen to mercenaries, showing how castles had sealed interiors to protect the inhabitants from their knights (why would that be needed if knights were gentlemen and not scoundrels?). The Tim the Enchanter scene in a quarry in Scotland, great light and sky. The Bridge of Death scene was one of the first shot. Shortened the ending tremendously, moved on to the end, there was supposed to be more dream-like, floating stuff in the end.

Eric Idle, John Cleese and Michael Palin commentary. Shot in March and April. Opening titles got huge laughs at Cannes. There had been a bomb scare at the theatre, though, so the fire brigade stopped the film right after the opening credits, pulled out the audience, and then they went back in and watched it, the audience thought it was a gimmick. Llamas, moose, Nixon, fish of any kind  old Python favorites. Discussion of Michael Palins mud-eating, which is never used/seen, Palin lost it on the 14th take and beat the ground with his fists. Michael is a sweet-tempered man, but even he can be can be goaded to fury by directorial perfectionism. Says Cleese, There is a version of this story in which this outbreak of most unusual bad behaviour on his part  much supported, I have to say, by all the spectators  was in fact occasioned by his discovery of the fact that hed never been on camera at all. I only heard that version recently, I hope its true. One of the rare ad-libs in the movie. He hasn't got s*** all over him  definition of a king. Original film was a collection of sketches that only had Arthur in a few scenes, and even went into modern day, Harrods, and others. The natural world made the film look great. The original soundtrack was one of the first sacrifices of the 16 or so pre-release test screenings. Black Knight scene comes from a story Cleese had heard from 1957 of two roman wrestlers who had become so entwined that the victor died! Cleeses one-legged stand-in was named Richard Burton. The voice of God is also Graham Chapman, so when He is talking to Arthur its really Graham talking to Graham. Neil Innes is the porter whos crushed by the Trojan rabbit. The old historian is also the guy whos not completely dead yet in the Bring out your dead scene. Neil is brought in because none of the Pythons could sing. John Cleese didn't like this scene, he thought that it was too bitchy. Smoke, air of menace. Cleese thought that the Glasgow girls would have been sexier if they were London girls in the Castle Anthrax scene. Lots of snickering about the girls who were cast for this scene. Meta-comment  where the whole scene would comment on itself!! Restored many years later. King and Prince Herberts guards scene John Cleeses favorite scene, he says it twice. Wide shot only, no close-ups. Lancelot running towards Swamp Castle had to be re-shot, because it was blurry, they did it on Hampstead Heath as well. Look carefully, there are two peasants pulling Roger the Shrubbers cart. Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd were major investors early on. Animation after the Knights of Ni second scene introduced to move plot along more quickly. Cleese nearly blown off of the crag. Total cost of film: 229,000. Electric donkey bottom biters!! Idle: Gilliams visual sense is unbelievable. Cleese on the army: We recruited them for fees of about a banana-and-a-half each a week, and they turned up and were immensely helpful and fun and enthousiastic. Thank you, students of Sterling University!

Among the language options you can select to have the screenplay flash across the whole screen. Ironic!

Disc 2  nice animated menu, but nothing too sophisticated.

Singalong  Knghts Of The Round Table (1:25), Sir Robin (1:25) and Monks Chant (2:00), with insitructions on how to use the DVD box to self-flagellate.

Quest for the Holy Grail locations. For 46 minutes, with Terry Jones. Inconsistent with the dignity of the fabric of the castle, was the reason given for not being able to shoot in any Scottish castles, except for the one that they did use, which was in private hands. A lot of hanging around and leaning against the castle. With Julian Doyle, production manager (who was also the arresting officer). Lancelots attack castle. They buy the script at Dune castle souvenir stand, where they have coconuts hanging about the souvenir stand. Theyre told that about 70% of the visitors know the film, 50% come because of the film - some come in chain mail! Dune Castle also triples as Castle Anthrax. The worlds worst name for seductive castles. Budget was supposed to be 150,000. They re-do the lines One day, lad, all this will be yours. What, the curtains? The find the Cave of Kair Bannogh again, its gotten ominously silent. Talking to Hamish Macinnes, leader of Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team. Michael Palin re-creates his catapult into the Gorge of Death. The island castle, Castle Aughhhhh, from the final scene of the film! Talked to the new owner (since 1965), with tales of knightly families losing it in drunken bets Find some local kids, put them onto camera to re-create the final charge scene with four kids! Even up to the arrest scene!! Organ outro music over credits. Directed by Julian Doyle!!

Sacred relics: Coconuts. Ministry of Coconuts gives information about coconuts for nearly three minutes! Gorilla gloves! Earmuffs, kneepads. Teaches how to knock them to sound like horse hooves. Japanese version, 8:30, which includes The French Castle, The Knights of Ni. One of the narrators is the voice actor who was the original Lupin Sansei!
BBC Film Night, Monty Python and the Holy Grail Location Report, 17:10. Alternate shots of the knights approaching castles on horseback, Terry Gilliam young and jubilant. John Cleese commenting on the directing. The jokes tend to be secondary to whether it looks good. Smoke in all shots, arty visual effects. How many laughs are there in the smoke? Flying cow. Eric Idle with fuzzy hair. A grail is a bird like a dodo with a very large beak, the grail is never found, its anticlimactic from the start Reading dialogue backwards Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Island, Chrysalis, Charisma, and Michael White the theater producer backed the film. The French taunters stand-in with non-French accents for the sake of filming (reading from script). Interviewer asks Graham Chapman how many poofters are there in it? Only one that Ive detected, but were not made for each other. Had trouble keeping track of who plays what, and whos left over. Scene of stage hands behind the fake castle wall throwing animals.

Old Rubbish shows nutty items, such as the Investors Preview of the film, old press releases and some visuals. Narrating a radio review of the film from May 1975.

Artefacts contains five film posters!!!

Photos contains a ton of behind-the-scenes items, such as the black knight scene  we get to see Cleese with his arm behind his back, and the mutilated Black Knight puppet, Terry Gilliam as the Green Knight, someone flying over the Bridge Of Death, 35 pics in total.

Trailers contains the original UK trailer, and the US 2001 re-release trailer. The UK trailer runs for three minutes, and is an audition for motion picture narration  in American English, in Scottish, in another Scottish goofy accent, and finally in Chinese!! Awesome scene of a castle cut-out toppling, just as King Arthur knights the mud peasant before killing him (out-take? Goofing around?). At the end, we see that its a Chinese restaurant ad!!! The US 2001 re-release trailer is the same thing, but a wee bit longer somehow and with nicer colours and sleek Now, for the first time on the wide screen cheesy stuff. Ha ha.

Unshot Footage shows Lego Knights (1:43 of the Camelot castle dancing scene, Were Knights Of The Round Table), Location Recce (In March of 1974 two first-time directors disappeared while looking for locations for their first feature film. In 2001 their footage was found in a garage in South London which may finally explain why there was so little money left to make the film itself), shows silly narration over stock footage from any old place, for 2:13) with Directors Commentaries, and Unused Ideas, consisting of 13 fascinating sketches  practically worth the price of admission here!!

25345,4,0767824571,"It almost shames me to admit that, despite claiming to be a nerd, I had never seen a Monty Python film or sketch.  Not ""Life of Brian,"" not ""Flying Circus,"" not even that (ahem) Holy Grail of nerdiness, ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail.""  Sure, I'd heard many of the classic jokes and lines from it, from the Black Knight's hysterical dismemberment to the Knights Who Say Ni (and demand a shrubbery to boot), but I had never experienced it for myself.  And given that it's one of those movies that people either seem to really love or really hate, I was wary about watching it for myself.

When a friend discovered I had never seen the movie, she decided to ""fix that"" by sitting me down and having me watch it with her.  And my verdict?  It's a bizarre film, and probably best in small doses, but it's definitely hilarious.

The story is a classic one - King Arthur organizes his Knights of the Round Table (mostly offscreen) and embarks on a quest to find that most sacred relic, the Holy Grail.  Naturally, this is far easier said than done, and Arthur seems cursed with a retinue of Knights that are both easily distracted and not all that bright.  And he must contend with some strange obstacles along the way, including but not limited to a three-headed giant, a band of rogue shrubbery-demanding knights, some rude Frenchmen, an enchanter named Tim, an inept but determined Black Knight, a killer rabbit, a castle full of beautiful and very lonely women, the police, bad animation, and much more.

If British humor isn't your cup of tea, you probably won't enjoy this film very much.  But if you don't mind your humor surreal and slightly deadpan, you'll probably get a kick out of this movie.  It makes no effort to be historically accurate or serious and plays every single situation as goofily as possible.  It also blatantly shatters the fourth wall at every opportunity, right up to the ridiculous climax of the film (which I won't spoil here).  It makes no sense, but it's still laugh-out-loud funny.

The film's obviously a low-budget affair, but the actors and screenwriters seemed aware of this and worked it to their advantage as much as possible.  Rather than ignore the fact that they couldn't afford horses, they play it up as much as possible, even pointing out that they're substituting a servant banging coconuts together for a proper horse... and making the coconuts a running joke throughout the film.  This actually adds to the surreal, screwball feel of the movie, rather than dragging it down.

The film does feel like a lot of one-shot sketches strung together into a full-length film, however, and at times the humor can wear a little thin.  This is probably best viewed as a party movie, or a piece at a time instead of in a single sitting by oneself.  Though I'm sure it could make for some hilarious drinking games or quote-along experiences.

Not for all tastes, and the Internet has probably spoiled most of the jokes, but still worth a look and good for some side-splitting laughs.  Best for ages 13 and up due to some off-color humor and a few scenes of over-the-top gore (played for laughs, of course).",1392681600,,3140,4.660617059891107

It is a low budget film that we enjoyed but I am not sure that we will spend money to buy the others.  The humor is a little too raw for my tastes.,1378080000,,479,4.010526315789473

25411,5,0767824571,"You know the scene: the Pythons riding through the countryside on their faithful invisible steeds, clip-clopping of hooves provided by a lackey clapping coconut shell halves together, in their search for the Holy Grail. They encounter all manner of obstacles and strange characters, from oppressed peasants who object to King Arthur's very existence, to three-headed knights who block their path, to a wizened gatekeeper for whom they must answer three questions, to a killer bunny.

Monty Python is an acquired taste, and this is their best film to help in the acquisition. Holy Grail is a highlight of a youngster's coming of age, providing a host of quotes and situations that are referenced forever after: the buxom maiden whom the duke tells his effete son to marry because she has ""vast [slight pause] tracts of land""; the French knights somehow ensconced in a castle in England, who tell Arthur they don't want to join the quest for the Holy Grail because they ""already have one""; the knight who suffers a ""flesh wound"" as his limbs are lopped off one by one; and the blessing of the Holy Hand Grenade for use against the killer bunny.

The Holy Grail was filmed with modest production values, but the Blu-ray picture quality is surprising, showing greatly improved colors and details. Although not the type of film one watches for reference quality video, it is nonetheless very pleasant to take in all the hilarious nonsense with a better picture. Numerous special features are offered on the Blu-ray, mostly ported over directly from the two-disc DVD edition. Like most Python productions nothing is taken too seriously, not the characters, nor the sets and costumes, and certainly not the story. But this casual appearance should not hide the fact that these guys are seriously funny, their stories endearing, their films memorable. King Arthur decides at one point that they will not return to Camelot just now, because it is ""a silly place"". Holy Grail is a silly movie, and it should be visited early and often in hope of finding still further silliness.",1377388800,3,2068,4.956772334293948

A mildly suggestive scene in the castle that houses only women is tame by 2013 standards.  Some violence with blood that is absurd enough to be comedic and acceptable to most 12 to 16 year olds.  This is a delightfully stupid movie and it helps if someone in the room has seen Monty Python before so that you can help explain to newcomers the disjointed, time warping, Python style of story telling.

25549,5,0767824571,"As we flew in their circus the comic geniuses known as Monty Python brought sketch comedy to a new level before making films. Though they made only four films that would be ""official"" Monty Python movies (Now for Something Completely Different, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Life of Brian, and The Meaning of Life) they worked together on several other occasions in stage, film, television and even video games. Of all Monty Python works of any kind, ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is by far the most quoted and remembered. This does not always mean a film is the best of a series, in fact often it is only the lowest common denominator, but in this case in my humble opinion this is the finest work they ever did. Many people, myself included, needed to see the film several times before catching each line since much of their rhetoric would be delightfully overcast by laughter. And like all great comedies it is best seen with friends. It is truly a gift to enjoy being bathed in the laughter of friends, and ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is in this way a truly precious gift.",1357084800,,1093,4.525252525252525

MONTY PYTHON and THE HOLY GRAIL 3-Disk Set
I can't recommend this classic enough. But first, let me say this, many people don't seem to care much for their sometimes very dry humor. I don't know if it's because they just dislike the British or their style of Humor, or because they are a different kind of people.  There are many Americans who love their humor and get it !.
Their humor can be wry, dry, and bizarre at times, but that's the Britt's !  As for Monty Python Comedy, if you're in a need of cheering up, something to brighten your day or night or just looking for something really hilariously funny, or to up-scale your funny meter, then I recommend a Monty Python Movie, because you can't go wrong. They will have you rolling on the floor laughing your fourth-point of contact ( military speak for your Butt ! ) off !
These guys have been around for years and in their own country, they can pack em into any auditorium with standing room only.
If you do decide to purchase this movie, I also highly recommend that you keep your remote control in your hand or very close by.  You may find the need to back up a little and then to pause, just so you can read one of their outrageously funny jokes, side notes, or even something irreverent that might appear where you least expect it to.  As I said, these guys are VERY !  Outrageously  F-U-N-N-Y !  and you don't want to miss anything.  I know it can sort of screw up the continuity of the movie but unless you have eagle-like vision and can read really fast, keep the remote handy.
For Great Comedy and Up Lifting Out of This World Humor, Monty Python is the way to go ! ..... And don't forget your Spamalot !",1356393600,,1761,4.2960725075528705

25578,3,0767824571,"Love the movie.  One of my favorites.  Love the transfer to blu-ray.  Crystal clear for the most part (a few scenes were apparently more problematic to transfer and are still pretty blurry, and it can be jarring when you come across those scenes because they really do stand out).  The extras are limited but interesting, and informative, with the possible exception of Terry Gilliam's commentary on the lost animation sequences.  (He really didn't sound very happy to be doing them.)

However, the ""Ultraviolet Digital Copy"" feature on this disc (which is adminstered by Sony) is entirely worthless.  You may think you are getting an actual copy of the movie to watch on your ipod, iPad, or other device at your leisure, right?  WRONG.  The downloadable copy is for your desktop or other primary computer ONLY.  And in order to get that, you must create an account with Sony, give them your personal information, and install their proprietary software (Silverlight) to download and view the copy.  After giving them my name, email and other information (and agreeing to allow them to send me marketing materials at that email address, which YOU MUST DO to proceed with the account creation - there is no way to opt out and still continue), jumping through all the installation hoops and installing Silverlight, it took my computer an additional 6 and one half hours over high-speed DSL to download this +/- 90 munite epic.  Amazing speed and efficiency, no?  Incidentally, the download also overheated and burned out my old DSL modem.

After all that, I tried to transfer the downloaded movie to iTunes.  Guess what?  You can't.  If you want to download it to a mobile device, you have to install additional software, go through the Ultraviolet site again, and essentially repeat the download process on that device.  God only knows how long it will take to download it agfain using an A5 chip...  Then, you can view the movie at your leisure on your mobile device, right?  Not according to the folks who have tried it!  If you are foolish enough to remove your mobile device from your house, you're out of luck!  You see, if you get outside the range of your WiFi connection, the movie will not be viewable.  Apparently the digital copy needs to contact Sony every time you try to view it.  Just a little quirk that Sony forgot to mention to you!  Want to take a copy of the movie on vacation?  Too bad!  Long car or plane ride?  Too bad!  Maybe someone should call Sony and inform them of the meaning of the word ""mobile"" so they stop advertising their ""digital copy"" for your ""mobile device"".

So, buy this blu-ray version movie if you only want the movie itself and do not want the ""digital copy"" (sorry I keep putting it in quotes, but I feel like, if there is no actual copy of the film that you can move around between devices, in what sense do you have an actual ""copy"" of anything?) go ahead and buy it.  Frankly, I can't recommend the movie enough.  Just don't expect to be able to use the ""digital copy"" that comes with it.

PS:  There are a number of movies (like James Cameron's new release of ""Titanic"" on blu-ray) that come with actual, bona fide digital copies. You plug a download code into iTunes, and it downloads automatically.  And you can watch that on any device you transfer a copy to.  Just look for the little ""iTunes"" logo on the cover.  And stay away from anything marked with ""Ultraviolet"".  Ultraviolet is not worth the money, not worth the hassle, not worth the time.  In short, UV copies are worthless.",1348531200,11,3535,4.649434571890145

25581,3,0767824571,"The Film:  Let's just say that this is one of my favorite comedies of all time.  I have lost count of the number of times I have watched this film or quoted it throughout my life.

The Video:  A nice upgrade from the (horrible) DVD, but still a disappointment overall.  The print is cleaned up nicely and the bright exterior shots look decent, but overall the film is too dark, flesh-tones are inconsistent, and its occasionally out of focus (you can see this even more in HD).  It's probably the best this film can ever look, but you'll still wish it looked better.

The Sound:  It sounds somewhat better than it looks with a 5.1 DTS-HD MA lossless audio track.  Not at all bad for a 40 year old film that was recorded in Mono, just don't expect it to sound like a modern blockbuster.

The Subtitles (yeah, I'm calling out the subtitles):  Subtitles are included in English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, and ""Subtitles For People Who Don't Like the Film"", which cleverly inserts scenes from William Shakespeare's 'Henry IV: Part 2' in case you just don't find the film all that funny.

Extras:  19 mins of deleted scenes and outakes in HD!.  Many are funny but too silly for even this movie.

Overall: One of the silliest and funniest films of all time looks and sounds the best we can probably ever hope for it to be.  If you're a fan it's worth it for the upgrade, just know what to expect.",1348185600,,1439,4.51937984496124

A big claim to make, but an entirely justifiable one.  Its a very well made film, full of classic sketches, eminently quotable lines, and some very good comic acting too.

MPATHG is unquestionably Monty Python's masterpiece, funnier than the needlessly offensive, overhyped and badly paced ""Life of Brian"" and much, much better than ""Meaning of Life"".  Sure it isn't perfect - the ending is weak and Gilliam's animations look a bit self-indulgent and more than a little tired, but you only notice those disadvantages because the rest of this film is so good the faults stand out in comparison.",1340928000,,771,4.795454545454546

The extras are fun, even though a lot of them were on the DVD, and not all were HD (to be expected). It does work really well with the iPad app, which made it that much more fun!

On to the next part...

The quality on the film transfer has left me underwhelmed. Some parts look OMGmazing, but several parts seem really grainy/pixelated. The audio quality is decent (I don't have surround sound hooked up to hear the overall experience, so take that with a grain of salt).

Detail is exquisite in this release, and the audio track has gone through similar improvements. Clarity is far greater, louder moments like swords clangs and explosions come off much crisper with no clipping.

I don't know how they can improve on this version to make me buy the movie again. Maybe they can CGI the animation so it looks slickly professional and full HD, and not like one guy making crude animations. Or get Graham Chapman to do some commentary... I don't why Graham can't be arsed, it's not like he has been busy the last 20 years or so.",1334016000,5,600,4.3097345132743365

It was literally that bad! But, I decided to push to the end. Big mistake! The movie just ends abruptly. Literally! The screen rips in the middle of a scene.

This movie is an absolutely travesty and wholly unfunny. I have not the slightest clue what people find funny about this. Maybe its the opiate of the masses. Maybe its one of those cult movies like the Ed Wood stuff that is so bad its funny, but this doesnt really put itself out that way and its fans seem to really be deluded into thinking its funny. It just plain isnt! At all.

once!

I played the regular DVD right after watching the Blu Ray and without question the quality is MUCH better. The picture isn't anywhere near as grainy, the contrast is much better and the sound is better. I haven't been this disappointed over the tranfer of a Blu Ray Dvd since Die Hard.

25601,5,0767824571,"I've been a Monty Python fan my entire life, and a huge fan of this film in particular. This is the best that MP&THG has ever looked, and perhaps as good as it ever will, or even can, look or sound.

Instead of rehashing what has already been said about the film itself and the shiny new 1080p video, I'd like to focus on a few of the extras, and what exactly is different about this release compared to the previous DVD release.

Most of the extras (Holy Grail locations, etc.) were all on the earlier DVD, but the new additions, the Outtakes and Lost Animations, are real gems available for the first time only on this Blu-Ray.

The Outtakes consist of longer versions of some scenes, which were understandably cut or shortened, but there are also some alternate takes and screw-ups with the cast forgetting lines or laughing in the middle of a take. It's all great fun, and a humorous look behind the scenes at an already drop-dead hilarious movie.

Terry Gilliam's Lost Animations are a hoot. We see a few spare parts that may not have had any particular intent, but there is also an extended opening to The Tale of Sir Robin, involving a collapsing cathedral, a stray rock catapulted into the sky and knocking out a flying dragon-like creature which then falls into the title card, impaling its mouth, collapsing, thus creating the ""R"" in ""Robin.""  And there is also an extended opening to ""The Tale of Sir Lancelot"" in which a cartoon Lancelot battles a giant slug. Total Gilliam lunacy at his stream-of-consciousness best!

The only cut scene I wish had been included as an extra is ""King Brian the Wild,"" which is a scene that was written but never shot. It appears only as a pencil sketch animation with sound on the Holy Grail video game that came out during the Dark Ages of video games. Unless it's an easter egg on this disc, or if it appears in the ""Holy Book of Days,"" which I have not had a chance to explore yet.

There are a couple of things missing from the Blu-Ray, including the ""Follow the Rabbit"" feature from the previous DVD. That feature would be useless here anyway, since the new ""Holy Book of Days"" downloadable feature promises to be far more extensive and comprehensive.  Also, the false opening ""Dentist on the Job"" short is not at the start of the film. Not a deal-breaker, of course, but if you are fond of that ephemeral opening gag, then hang on to your DVD.

The Blu-Ray menus are much better than the DVD menus, which I always thought were rather tedious and impossible to by-pass.

The various audio tracks, commentaries and subtitles (including the Japanese language track and the Henry VI subtitles) are all there, but on the DVD the default audio was the original mono track. Here the default is the more recent stereo remaster, including Michael Palin's re-recording of the narration.

This Blu-Ray release is a very impressive return to a fantastic comedy that has stood the test of time.",1331251200,18,2932,4.608445297504798
25602,5,0767824571,"As a Monty Python fan I've patiently waited for this movie to come to Blu-ray(2012) but didn't have very high expectations that it would look and sound all that good. Well I was wrong. It looks and sounds Great! And I'm not going to tell you it's an excellent movie, you already know that--great British humor(actually universal humor), ridiculously funny, great actors. And a silly price of only $9.99 (was $12.99 on release date).

Sony did a 1080p transfer(1.66:1 original aspect ratio) of this movie that looks amazing! There's lots of strong detail in faces, clothes, as well as surroundings like buildings, grass, trees. Flesh and earth tones look very natural. Blacks are deep. Strong color is not going to jump out at you, but that's just the nature of the film as the outdoor setting of much of the movie's grass, dirt, and rocks(browns, blacks, grays & greens) never contained strong color elements. But what color there is (like in the tabards,coat of arms, shields) looks very good indeed. Is the movie without soft shots or grain? No, but they've brought out a whole lot of nicely rendered detail that makes the movie a joy to watch. Until now, I feel like I've only seen this movie through a fog. Well, the fog has finally lifted and everything looks sooo fresh.

The audio is a lossless soundtrack (DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless). Voices sound very crisp and clear. Sound effects in general are very good. Audiofiles will notice some very rich sounding sections, but also some that are just acceptable. Overall, it is very enjoyable with nice use of surround sound and I think most people will be more than happy with it.

The center pegs are made of a hard plastic that's all one piece, therefore making it almost impossible to remove the discs without risking breaking it.

The opening scene castle, the French castle, Castle Anthrax, Swamp Castle, the Camelot dancing scene... I could go on but that's it so I would then be lying.

I played this DVD on a Samsung Blu-Ray player and the quality was better than I expected. Nothing like today's movies of course, but for the time period and budget of the movie it looked perfect. Any higher quality would probably take away from the experience!

25638,5,0767824571,"I don't get all the negative reviews. Although all these people like the movie, they all have the same complaint; ""Defective Discs.""
Mine plays wonderfully. Maybe there was a glitch in the production of this edition, and it was corrected, and the one I bought, was manufactured after. Maybe. Just a guess. So it looks as though I am one of the lucky ones.

""Holy Grail"" was the Pythons' first foray into feature-length films, save ""Now For Something Completely Different,"" which was nothing more than selected comedy bits from the TV series, faithfully reproduced on a sound stage, without an audience in attendance. Here was the first ""new"" product since the TV show's end, and despite all the trouble they had making it, it is, in many ways, their best work. It is SO dense, so layered, and dutifully crafted, it proves the cast/writers were far from finished when they did, per se, finish their TV run as Monty Python.

Graham Chapman is wonderful as King Arthur, despite drinking himself stupid on a daily basis, but this is where he stopped, and tried to take better control of his life. As the others have said, Heaven is now a sillier place; too bad for us, cancer is nothing to trifle with. The thing which is so effective in Chapman's work here, is he plays the role 100% straight, seemingly impervious to the silliness around him. This harkens back to his ""General"" from the TV show, chiding everyone around him for being ""silly."" There is a continuity to their entire body of work, and the astute fan always sees it right away. They have certainly created their own universe, one outsiders cannot comprehend, but those in on it, are enjoying it beyond anyone's wildest dreams.

Possibly the movie's most memorable scene, is also its most gruesome. The sword fight between King Arthur (Chapman), and the Black Knight (John Cleese), is very well staged, and the gratuitous violence therein is belied by the Black Knight's complete refusal to admit defeat. Cleese himself has said, if the Black Knight acknowledged defeat, or even an injury, this would be THE MOST vicious scene in any film, and I tend to agree. Hitting someone in the shoulder with a heavy sword, and seeing their arm drop off, while arterial blood sprays from the wound, is extremely nasty, by any definition, but they ingeniously turn something as grisley as dismemberment, into a piece of classic comedy. This is something I have NEVER been able to wrap the brain around; I simply can't process it, although I understand, the members of Monty Python will go to ANY length to get a laugh, or at least a reaction, out of an audience.

So, if one wants to risk a defective copy of this gem, I have no qualms saying ""Go for it."" It is a genuine classic, with a lot of other bits to keep one occupied for a while.

Graham Chapman is still alive to me.",1276732800,3,2825,4.653306613226453

I know the Pythons wanted the movie to be completely absurd and nonsensical pointless.

Maybe humans can never reach that without some of themselves showing through.

 In fact I thought the movie had some warmth and affection towards King Arthur and the whole story. Also made some good points about society.

I think the English have sought the Holy Grail for two thousand years - and still do not know what it exactly is(multiple theories), where it is (let's hope not in France) or even IF it is.

The killer bunny, the virgins, the weird prince who wants to sing, the lack of horses for the knights, the Knights who once said Ni.  The movie is full of extras and so is are the DVDs.  Legos, sing-alongs, on-screen screenplay, commentaries full of back-stabbing, complaints and whining by the crew of Month Python.  Looking for a message?  Well, there may be a few, but mostly it was meant to be funny, the kind of funny that burns into your brain and slowly burns its way out, till you laugh aloud on the bus, or at the wedding, or when they are trying to pull a tooth.

Quite apart from the fact that the main movie disk features two movie tracks, one with superior sound quality and even slightly different narration from Michael Palin, there's also a French language track which I watch for just as many laughs as the English ones despite not speaking a word of French myself. And then of course there are two commentary tracks from the various Pythons, minus Graham Chapman for obvious reasons. The story is often way over the top but what else did you expect from the Pythons? Favorite scenes of mine are Arthur's encounter with the Black Knight, the plague scene, the self-abusive St. Benedictine monks, The Tale of Sir Robin, the Knights of Ni (both encounters), and of course Tim the Enchanter and the Bridge of Death. The Special Features disk includes such gems as a documentary explaining how one can obtain and use one's own coconuts for use in fake horse riding and, my personal favorite, a snippet, narrated by Palin if I'm not mistaken, explaining in gory detail how one can sing along with the chant of the St. Benedictine Monks (see the review title), by explaining the proper technique to whack oneself over the head with the DVD box.

25662,5,0767824571,"You know, I would've loved to have been in the audience when Monty Python and the Holy Grail was first shown. I'm picturing a fair amount of laughter, but also quite a bit of confusion and critics saying, ""What the hell did I just see?"" That was certainly the case when Roger Ebert reviewed the first Monty Python movie, And Now For Something Completely Different. He seemed very interested in the audience reaction during his review, and I imagine the audience reaction during the first screenings for this film would've been similar.

Of course, by the time Monty Python and the Holy Grail came out in 1976, the original series had been airing on PBS for a couple years, so people were more familiar with the show. But still. Just imagine what reactions must've been like for those poor souls who went into this movie never having seen the TV program.

I don't need to tell most of you about the plot to this film. King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table go off to find the Holy Grail. Most of the major knights from the stories are here, though Guinevere and Merlin are strangely absent (though there is an enchanter named Tim). The film also adds the rather cowardly Sir Robin and the aptly-named Sir Not Appearing in this Film.

The movie itself is a fascinating hodge-podge of hilarity. You get to see several film genres, including swashbucklers, fantasy, epics and musicals, all get joyfully skewered. One cost-saving move, using coconuts banged together to simulate the sound of horses, since they couldn't actually afford horses, is an inspired notion. Despite that, much of the film shows the time period in a more realistic fashion than most other movies. There's lots of dirt and lots of mud and people know the king is the king because ""He hasn't got [...] all over him.""

Everyone who has seen the movie has their favorite moments. For me it's probably a toss up between the ""Spamalot"" song, the Holy Hand Grenade, and the ""Help, help! I'm being repressed!"" scene. The events at Castle Anthrax is a close follow-up, but really the whole movie works and works well. There's not a bad moment in the film, not a joke that falls flat.

This movie, like all great films, has left behind a huge legacy, though not in the way some might think. Often times it's a legacy that filmmakers try to avoid. For example, in the the commentary on The Lord of the Rings films you will frequently hear Peter Jackson somewhat humoursly lament how hard they tried to avoid giving their movies a Holy Grail feeling. Of course the movie also lead to the hit Broadway musical, Spamalot, which I've never seen, but heard great things about.

This movie isn't for everyone, of course. There's always a few humourless louts out there who won't enjoy it. Us normal folk know better, however, and we can enjoy it for the wonderful, creative, hilarious film it is!",1243728000,,2857,4.658730158730159

25684,5,0767824571,"This is probably my favorite movie of all time, comedy or otherwise. I haven't seen a huge amount of movies - I'm more of a music guy myself - but here's one that I keep revisiting. It's one of those rare comedies (at least according to my rather limited experience) where literally every gag not only succeeds, but succeeds wonderfully. This is easily up there with classics like Airplane! and Young Frankenstein, and something tells me it might be even better.
Even if you've never seen this movie, you're probably familiar with most of it, because it's passed into ""pop-culture-touchstone""-ism for good reason. I'm sure you have friends who can recite scenes of this movie by heart. I know, because pretty much all of my friends can. Me included. But it's just so funny, so off-the-wall, and so original that it never gets old. It's just one of those types of movies, you know?
So what's the humor like? If you've seen a single episode of the Flying Circus (and if you haven't, you need to get off your computer and go see Dead Parrot, Self Defense against Fruit, Ministry of Silly Walks and about a dozen others RIGHT NOW), you should know what to expect. There's a healthy dose of the absurd, and I live for the absurd. Cows, wooden badgers, and ""Holy Handgrenades"" are thrown about. It's also extremely irreverent - check out the God scene (my personal favorite - ""of COURSE it's a good idea!""), King Arthur's discussions with communist peasants, the French, the infamous Black Knight, and the final scene, which is an excellent combination of anticlimactic and hilarious. It's also somewhat morbid (i.e. ""I'm not quite dead!""), and there are a few sex jokes, but far from being the cheap, tacky ones Will Ferrel specializes in, they're gut-busters. For example, the Sir Galahad (""the chaste!"") scene is a highlight, or at least would be a highlight if everything in this movie wasn't a highlight. And the low-budget-ness adds to the laughs, of course. There's a bit of cheesy fake blood that looks like red food coloring, and I find that really funny.

Disc One was loose in the box, with no way to secure it, but Disc Two was secured with a central hub that I absolutely could not remove the disc from to save my life.  The wheels on my car are not held as securely, and I was very concerned about breaking the disc in my attempts.  I even made a futile attempt to bang it with a coconut, to no avail.  I finally ended up sacrificing the ""collector value"" of the packaging and quite literally destroying the central hub with an X-Acto knife and a drill burr to remove the disc without destroying it.  Knowing Python, I could almost see this as some part of a larger joke, but not quite.  Did anyone else have this problem, or did I just purchase an unusually tenacious box, or am I just a clod?

The film stars John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, and Terry Gilliam, who not only acts but also serves as the film's co-director and animator. Each member of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monty-Python/dp/B000GEIRSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monty Python</a>&nbsp;is perfect in their (dis)respective roles, but standing out from the others is the late Graham Chapman, who plays King Arthur as the ""straight character"". Chapman portrays Arthur as a serious, heroic figure who is completely unaware of his self-satirizing surroundings.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monty-Python-and-the-Holy-Grail/dp/B000CRQX34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a>&nbsp;begins with a series of gags involving mock-Swedish subtitles and of all things, moose and llamas. After some of the strangest credits ever, the first scene opens on an epic shot of the mist-shrouded moors of medieval Britain. Two men come galloping heroically into view. What's odd is that neither of them are on horses. In fact, one of them is simply banging two halves of a coconut shell together to simulate the sound of hoof beats. Thus hilarity ensues. The story also includes such memorable characters as an obnoxious French ""taunter"", a three-headed knight, an effeminate prince who just wants to sing, a ghastly cartoon monster, and perhaps the most lethal rabbit ever put on film.

What makes the film so bloody funny is the complete lack of respect that it shows to Arthurian legend and medieval folklore. Both Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones (the dementedly brilliant directors and co-stars) are quite familiar with medieval history and delight in lampooning it at every turn. The dialogue is perfectly ridiculous and that's precisely what makes it so entertaining.
I won't go into great detail about the plot (ha-ha-ha!) or the innumerous zany characters other than to say it's absolutely irreverent and mad (something that seems common with the Pythons). Even the ending of the film is intentionally anti-climactic.
But if you want British comedy without restraint, then check out this classic or, ""I'll wave my private parts at your aunties, you cheesy lot of secondhand, electric-donkey bottom biters!""
Oh, and don't forget your coconuts.

The 2-disc Special Edition includes the following special features: an audio commentary by directors and stars Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, an audio commentary by John Cleese, Eric Idle, and Michael Palin, Follow the Killer Rabbit feature, Subtitles for People Who Don't Like the Film (taken from Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part II), On-Screen Screenplay, three Sing-Alongs, The Quest for the Holy Grail documentary, BBC Film Night: On Location with Monty Python and the Holy Grail vintage featurette, two scenes from the Japanese language version of the film, How to Use Your Coconuts instructional featurette, Monty Python and the Holy Grail in Lego short film, extensive image galleries, An Interactive Cast Directory, and theatrical trailers.

If you have no knowledge of British humor though you may get a bit confused, so I wouldn't recommend it if you're gonna expect nothing but toilet humor. Plus, this movie must have the most halting ending ever for a movie, and it's extremely unpredictable!

It is not my intention to convince non-Christians that they should convert, nor is it my intention to convince other Christians that they must agree with my opinions.  What follows is simply my view of this item through the lens of my understanding of the Christian faith, so I trust that none will be offended by points-of-view I express with which they disagree.  Peace.

This movie is really a parody of two things.  First, it is a parody of the Middle Ages in England.  Second, it is a parody of our modern presuppositions of that time.  It is because the door of parody swings both ways in this film that it is able to be so incredibly funny.  Parody is funny because there is an element of truth involved.  Here, there are two truths, thus the film is twice as funny: there is the truth concerning the Middle Ages, and there's the truth concerning our impressions of the Middle Ages.  By cracking fun at both of these sources of truth, the Monty Python comedy group was able to produce solid parody that is smart, witty, and and in some ways convicting.  Overall, the film is very enjoyable and fun to watch and re-watch.

As a Christian, however, I have a couple of minor reservations about watching this film.  First, though by no means comparable to much of the filth that comes out of Hollywood these days, this movies has a fair share of foul language.  Some of the worst incidents of foul language are likely to go unnoticed because of the accent/language barrier and the manner of production.  For example, at one point the film cuts quickly to a character from a previous scene who says that at least his scene didn't involve a litany of a certain category of sex jokes.  Here, this character uses a less than appropriate word which is not even appropriate for me to repeat.  However, it goes by so fast that I didn't even notice it until the third or fourth time I watched the movie.

Most of the foul language used is less overtly offensive, and especially because much of this language seems to be well established within the English-comedy tradition it is almost fair to say that it's an essential part of making a funny parody of this sort.  Needless to say, if you are uncomfortable with some incidents of foul language, or if you simply don't think such usage is funny, this movie probably is not for you.  This movie also contains one scene with a significant amount of sexual innuendo and here there is even a reference to oral sex.  However, insofar as this scene does not contain any overtly sexual content of a graphic nature, I think it is not so bad as to require Christians to avoid watching the movie altogether.

I give this movie five stars because it is very funny and smart.  It is an example of a type of humor that is hard to come by these days.  However, I would hesitate to give this movie to anyone younger than 18 or so; I know that when I watched this movie for the first time when I was 15 I did not have the spiritual maturity to discriminate between the quality parody and the few incidents of inappropriate tastelessness.  Other than that, this movie is a classic, and I hope you enjoy it!",1203897600,12,3329,4.506666666666667

My ten dollars towards this movie was incredibly well spent. I knew this as soon as I learned that the making of this ""Masterpiece"" was not so much all ""Fun and Games"" as I had originally thought.

While watching the ""out-takes"", as they call them, I noticed that there was a moment that John Cleese was neither smiling, nor funny...
What a jackass he must be to not appreciate the ""Charmed"" life he is having at all times.

But... we watch from beginning to end... The movie starts with King Arthur of the Britons searching throughout the land for brave men to join him to form Camelot... the Knights of the Round Table.

He finds the pure Sir Galahad... the daring and brave Sir Lancelot...  As the movie opens, you hear the distant clapping of horses hooves, only to realize that what you are indeed hearing is only  a servant, banging coconuts together to pretend... and you know you are in for an ever ending sequence of rather funny and definitely silly recreations of history... where famous characters spend their days and nights overcoming obstacles in search of the Holy Grail.

King Arthur is played by Graham Chapman, while John Cleese is seen as the Second Swallow-Savvy Guard, The Black Knight, Peasant #3, Sir Lancelot, the Brave, the French Guard who taunts King Arthur's group, and finally as Tim, the Enchanter.

In the end... King Arthur finds the Castle of Arrrghhh... where the Holy Grail actually is... and we had no choice but to say to ourselves.... Arrrghhh!!!",1178409600,2,1374,4.704166666666667

25735,5,0767824571,"Ah yes, Monty Python and the Holy Grail: One of the funniest movies EVER made. Who could forget the coconuts replaced for a horse, or the famous lines like ""Its' just a flesh wound"" and ""We are the nights who say 'ni'!""? It may have been low budget, but if you think about it, those are usually the best kinds of movies around.

The movie is layden with completely random parts, but you can tell the characters in the movie know it's random so it works for the film. The arguments over the swallows carrying coconuts, the black night scene, the scene where you ""Bring out ya dead!"", the nights who say ""ni"", and the very, VERY random scene with the animated sun and clouds yelling ""Stand up! Stand up!"" This is all pretty confusing at first, but that's the genius of Monty Python. And these sorts of scenes seem to fit in no matter how bizzare they are. And you just gotta love the beginning with the subtitles continuously being messed up, with some guy typing about his sister getting bitten by a moose. The ending is probably my only complaint, as it's so abrupt and kinda leaves a little to be desired.

This version comes with some great bonus features: The commercial that inspired the coconuts idea, the sites for the castle shots, and some random ones as well. One of my favorites would have to be on the first disc, where you click on the bonus features and someone says, ""Please insert the second disc."" Then 5 seconds later you hear, ""No, into the DVD player,"" and you hear someone zipping his pants up!

Probably the biggest treat on the DVD is the Kamelot scene done entirely with legos - very cool feature. It would have been even better if they included the WHOLE movie in lego form, but oh well....

The movie is 5 stars all the way, but I do have on complaint. On the packaging, you are promised a completely remastered version of the movie, but the picture is as gritty and dreary as ever. And it's annoying as hell to see little parts of the movie in crystal clear picture on one of the bonus features. I mean, why they didn't just do that for the whole movie?

But that's a very small complaint, because we're talking about Monty Python and the Holy Grail here. Even if the picture is never remastered, at least will still have one of the greatest comedies of all time.",1174608000,2,2289,4.414691943127962

25739,2,0767824571,"The English comedy group Monty Python (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin), is widely known for its series of humorous sketch shows, broadcast on television in the early 1970s. Much of their work was a humorous combination of the creative, farcical, and surreal, such that the group's influence on subsequent comedy was significant. In ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", they tried their hand at a feature length film that spoofed the Arthurian legends and the quest for the holy grail, with a parody of the chivalrous knights of medieval tales. Being a fan of the Arthurian legends and of parody, it was this combination that first attracted me to this film, as well as the fact that it is often regarded as one of the greatest comedy films of all time.

But does Monty Python & the Holy Grail live up to this reputation?  The influence and popularity of Monty Python is indisputable, but that does not mean that this comedy troupe has found favour from all quarters. Certainly they display the potential to come up with some extraordinarily creative and original humor, appreciated especially by those who find the surreal and absurd in any way funny.  But it is regrettable that the humor of their television shows often descends into the risque and irreverent.  Monty Python and the Holy Grail is no different in that it contains both the usual brand of Python humor, as well as a significant amount of irreverence and sexual innuendo. Some parts are funny, in fact tremendously so, for who can ever forget the defeat of the killer rabbit with Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, the three-headed Knights that say ""Ni--!"", the Bridge of Death with its absurd riddles, and the closing scenes where our heroic knights are conquer the grail, only to be arrested by British policemen.  But the clever humor doesn't excuse the large amounts of blasphemous material, which frequently is used as a source of humor in connection with the religious aspects of the grail. Monty Python took their irreverence even a step further in a subsequent film, Life of Brian, which is a parody of the Biblical Messiah Jesus Christ. But it's not just unholy religious humor that's problematic here - discerning viewers should realize that ""the Holy Grail"" also contains some risque sexual innuendo in the usual Monty Python style.  And these moral concerns aside, there are cases in ""the Holy Grail"" where the surreal attempts at humor just aren't funny, but stupid.

Critiquing a sacred cow is always dangerous, not least when this films is regarded one of comedy's holy grails.  But those of us who err on the side of conservatism with our moral standards will want to give this film a miss. For a more innocent parody of chivalry which avoids the unholiness and irreverence of this humor, try instead Goldman's The Princess Bride. - GODLY GADFLY",1171497600,8,2875,4.865030674846626

This movie is silly, irreverent, illogical, ahistorical, hysterical, naughty, and utterly charming.

Monty Python is a comedy genius!!!!!",1171065600,2,391,5.078125
25741,5,0767824571,"Through the mist in medieval England is the sound of hoof-beats.  Horsemen are approaching!  Regaled in armor and accompanied by banners and porters, what a fine sight to see.  However, you quickly realize that there are no horses.  Are those coconuts?  Yep, they sure are.  ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is unlike any movie you have ever seen before, and quite likely will ever see again (unless some fool attempts to do a remake).

This movie has made several lists of the greatest comedies of all times.  Yet, not every one thinks the movie is funny.  People who like the Monty Python television shows, who like British humor in general, and prefer wry or ironic humor will find this movie funny.  Forget about slapstick.  This movie has very little slapstick.  Occasionally the jokes fall flat.  However, when the jokes work, they are hilarious.  Countless numbers of people have repeated the jokes from ""The Holy Grail"" in the three decades plus since the original release of the movie.

Here are some samples of the humor.

The lads are traveling through a forest when they meet the fearsome Knights Who Say Nee.  As an aside, I have seen the spelling ""Nee"" and ""Ni.""  I am clueless as to which is correct.  The Knights Who Say Nee demand tribute from our heroes so that they may pass.  The tribute shall be...a SHRUBBERY!  Yes, a shrubbery.  How fortunate that our questing heroes soon encounter a shrubber (supposedly a man who creates shrubberies).

In yet another scene we meet a most horrific creature, capable of felling entire legions of men.  Yes, it is the fearsome Killer Rabbit.  This fearsome rodent will take some serious weaponry to conquer.  Until then, the buck tooth bunny bloodily makes short work of several knights.  How fortunate they have a holy hand grenade.

Then there is the tale of Sir Lancelot.  Poor chaste Lancelot ends up in a castle filled with nubile young women who urge Lancelot to spank them.  How unfortunate that the prospect of being spanked sends them into bursts of enthusiasm.

""The Holy Grail"" contains numerous jokes that range from small to large.  Some of the humor pokes fun at nearly everything imaginable.  Religion gets lampooned numerous times.  Ignorance and fear of the unknown are also regularly parodied.  Scientists, Camelot, Knights, peasants, politicians, judges, and many others get varying levels of treatment; even a duck.  After all, not everyone can be thoroughly lampooned in a movie that is an hour and a half long.

Much of the humor is subtle.  Much of the humor requires knowledge of various subjects to understand the irony.  There have been quite a few articles and summaries written regarding the humor in this movie.  If you wish to catch every single joke you should seek these references because there are so many jokes that it is easy to miss some.  I still pick up on new ones each time I watch the movie.

Some people have stated this movie is slow.  I am clueless as to what these people mean.  I have to keep backing the movie up to be sure I catch the subtleties in some scenes.  There are places where I think the movie is too fast.  This movie offends some people.  There are certainly numerous opportunities to be offended.  If you are easily offended, do not buy the movie.

Here is an interesting bit of trivia:  The profits from Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"" album helped finance this movie.  The members of Pink Floyd were supposedly big fans of the television show.

As with many comedy movies, this one will appeal to people that enjoy a certain kind of humor.  English humor is considered ""dry"" by American standards.  For ""dry"" you may read subtle.  Some jokes are easier to understand if you understand England, and particularly medieval England.  Other jokes are wonderfully ironic and require little more than an open mind and a broad sense of humor (think about the killer rabbit).

Regardless of whether an individual viewer considers ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" to be funny, the movie continues to have a loyal fan base (myself included).  Every time I watch the movie I seem to see something different and enjoy the same jokes over again.  I can only hope that my sense of humor will always be sufficiently open to appreciate this movie.

Since we Yanks have had a bit of an inferiority complex about that for the last couple-hundred years, that made them the height of humor. Add in that whole legendary grail thing.

And we have loved it well, for these many years. The broad gag, the running joke, the literate aside, we've spent years here trying to show y'all that it didn't go over our heads. It really was funny. Lots of it still is.

But times have moved on. Parts are still good, but standards have changed. Fer cryin' out loud, a geeky high school boy with no girlfriend has more gigaflops in his botnet then existed back then. Effects? That's not effects. THIS is effects!

The movie was as good now as it was then, but ""good"" now isn't what was ""good"" then. I found the extras to be extraneous. Memory was much kinder to this movie than reality testing was, except in a few places:

""I got better.""

""I will taunt you again.""

""I'll bite your legs off.""

But alas, there is no I in ""reminiscing."" Well, it's a metaphor. If you just have to be that niggly about it, there are three, but I meant the higher I that it doesn't have, in that metaphoric way. Well, it's my metaphor and it means what I said it means. What do you mean, what I mean? I mean - I mean that you mean what I mean, but not the way you mean it.

25751,5,0767824571,"King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table set out on a quest to find the Holy Grail...as told to do so by a cartoon God that lives in the clouds...

Easily the most hilarious and original comedy ever made, Monty Python and the Holy Grail claims it's undisputed throne through insanely ridiculous situations and characters that will very likely never be duplicated. Pure comedic genius that doesn't go stale with age or decades of competition having been released. Simply seeing the way comedy films are made today, this film will very likely have a long reign before anything can even hold a candle to it. An absolute belly-laugh fest that never lets up.

Only the cast of Monty Python could have pulled this film off, with each actor playing many different characters...all hilarious! The genius in the actors' lines themselves are truly to be admired. The comedic style of talking in circles is one technique that most comedies do not try to do, simply because they can't compete with the genius of this film, which uses it flawlessly. Those that do try usually fall flat on their faces. Two particularly excellent examples of this can be seen in the beginning scene, in which the characters discuss the origins of coconuts.....and the other when Lancelot breaks into the swamp castle to save the ""damsel in distress."" This is merely one technique that the cast has perfected to conjure up laughs consistently throughout the entire film. The only way that I can imagine that someone might not like this film is if they simply do not enjoy it's type of humor. Too bad for them.

Another hilarious technique used in the film is the use of comedy in the background. From people slamming cats against poles for no apparent reason, to people filling up baskets with mud in the fields....all very strange and hilarious at the same time. It's also simply amazing that all of the characters are played by the same group of actors, which shows the great range all of them have. Some are simply unrecognizable from one character to the other and it sometimes takes a good eye to pick them out, which makes it fun. And I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but this film takes some turns that no sane person could see coming.

Ridiculous characters in ridiculous situations equals ridiculous laughter.

The epitome of all-star comedy that will no doubt continue to stand the test of time. Kudos to Gilliam and the rest of the Python crew. If you haven't seen it yet, make it your first priority in life!",1163808000,7,2497,4.691780821917808
25752,5,0767824571,"""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" would have to rank as one of Python's high points and came to be almost an icon of the group's zany humour. My first viewing of the movie left me at once choking for oxygen and impressed by some of the subtle angles they took. Admittedly, not that much was all that subtle in the end.

Containing great scenes that still endure as massively quotable, (even non-Python fans have heard of them), this is definitely a must-have for anyone remotely interested in the work of Monty Python. The black knight at the bridge is still one of the funniest things I have seen, (I still kill myself laughing at it). The ""anarcho-syndicalist"" serfs, (""You can't expect to weild supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!"" -- Dennis to King Arthur), were just a treat. Overall, it is a good whipping at anything concerning King Arthur and a host of other tales from the medieval period.

Simply put, this is among the best that Monty Python have done, and after over 30 years, it is still up there with the best comedy on the planet. I loved it back then, and I still love it now.

25770,5,0767824571,"One of my favorite comedies, and Monty Python's best and most irreverent movie is Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The Monty Python troop made three films and had a television series that challenged the status quo by dealing with religion, class welfare, politics and dead parrots. There humor seems as fresh and rebellious today as when it was aired. Sometimes their humor was forced -- some scenes in The Meaning of Lif(e) ; however, Monty Python and the Holy Grail has the perfect mix of antitoletarism, irreverence and silly sots.

Speaking of silly sots, the cast of this film -- including Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin -- would later take Hollywood like a fierce Killer Rabbit. The kind that lops off men's 'eds' with fangs three-feet long. Monty Python never quite made the mainstream in America; nevertheless, its actors (and directors) did.

Monty Python and the Holy Grail remains a cult favorite amongst geeky young males who play Magic in comic book shops. Many of these men grow up to be comic writers or shrubbery salesmen. These comic writers find many ways to allude (or just plain mention) many scenes in this movie. Examples are the Simpsons, the now defunct Freaks and Geeks and the title of Scorcese's Bringing Out the Dead. However, there is more to this film than fanatical fans. It is the antithesis to The Rocky Horror Picture Show, it is a cult movie that is actually good.

Reviews on movies like this one are difficult to write because the charm and essence of the film are in its characters and insane skits. Recapping the plot does nothing to convey the essence of the film unless you write it in an irreverent or silly manner. Since I am beyond that type of blasphemous writing, I should either plod on or quit and do my laundry.

I would rather do my laundry later, so I will go on.

This film was loosely based on King Arthur and the Holy Grail. I am also sure this film was loosely based on a script. Though the plot is chaotic and the cast few, the movie is funny and witty. My only disagreement with the movie is the forced ending. That is only a scratch, a mere flesh wound to this brilliant comedy -- a fanatical farce that is one of my favorite movies.",1158192000,4,2242,4.581047381546135

25777,5,0767824571,"There are so many things about this (and indeed any) Monty Python movie that one hardly knows where to begin. Nothing is left out of the mix--history, religion, politics, personal relationships, prejudices, intellectual prowess or the lack thereof. My title, of course, comes from an early scene in with Arthur approaches a castle, inexplicably occupied by French k-nigits, who claim to already have a grail.

The Monty Python troupe, led by the creative talents of Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, incorporated John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle and Graham Chapman as King Arthur, the dominant role in the film. No animals were harmed in the filming, not even an African Swallow, non-migratory as they are. A few coconuts bit the dust, however, as did more than a few comic images. Logic bits the dust, too, on more than one occasion. I did a paper once for symbolic logic which I was told ten years later was still being passed about because I had dared to use something so unconventional as this Monty Python movie in the references (I couldn't see why that wouldn't be much more common, and indeed, hope it is today--I use 'Life of Brian' in homilies, so why not this film in logic?).

The particular logical incident (or rather, illogical incident) involves the trial of a woman accused of being a witch. Through 'logic' it is demonstrated that she would be a witch if she weighed the same as a duck (which, surprisingly enough, it turns out that she does -- 'It's a fair cop' she concedes as the general rejoicing commences at the prospect of a bonfire). Those who have benefit of the 'Executive Version of the Soundtrack of the Trailer of the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail' are also treated to an exposition of the logical problems which itself concludes that 'sex is better than logic'. And who could argue with that reasoning?

However, my favourite scene would have to be the liturgical procession and reading of instructions for the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, with the leader's instruction 'skip a bit, brother' -- an instruction which I've searched in vain in the liturgical handbooks, but would vastly improve many readings on some mornings in church. This is a perfect parody of the sonorous but deadening readings that seem to drag on interminably.

A close second would be the scene in which Arthur tries to explain his kingship to members of an autonomous collective (read, peasants without a lord) who view him as just another oppressor, and inform him that watery tarts throwing swords at you is not an adequate basis for the exercise of supreme executive power.

Those who have visions of Great Britain as royal and cultural icons are often amazed-the likes of Monty Python and Benny Hill (among others) show the inhabitants of the UK as just as human (if not moreso) than the rest of the world. And we are all the richer for it. Alas, the Holy Grail is never actually attained by the seekers, who run into trouble with more French k-nigits and the local constabulary. But, the journey's the thing, so they teach me in seminary, and thus, this journey is well worth following to the end.

The DVD comes with many extras, including the Camelot song being sung by Lego-land figures, and extensive commentary by actors and others involved in the production.

25782,4,0767824571,"As a teacher of medieval Grail literature, I have shown ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" to many generations of students -- and indeed there are a number of scenes that really do help young people understand either the medieval literary tradition or medieval history. These include not only the unforgettable ""Bring out your dead scene,"" which educates the fortunate modern viewer on the ubiquity of the medieval Bubonic Plague, but also the Grail Castle with its unimaginable and unaskable question, not to mention the over-the-top battle ethos that would lead to a knight's having not only his arms and legs cut off but also his head! It's hard to believe that such scenes have their medieval progenitors (though I do have to say I know of no medieval precedent for the ""shrubbery"" scene), but honestly they do.

More than that, however, in my book the very best scene of this film has absolutely nothing to do with the Grail or with anything medieval -- and that is the scene of the fierce rabbit. I still cannot watch this film without cracking up (as we moderns say) over the scene in which the ""harmless little rabbit"" attacks the Arthurian troupe. The hubris that the rabbit scene uncovers is a sadly (but hilariously) universal feature of human nature.

But even the rabbit scene hooks back into the medieval theme, as it links to an exploration of a cave with literary texts that conclude because ""....arrgh...."" Well, indeed, many medieval texts remain unfinished, perhaps because the authors died, more likely due to the vagaries of preservation. So Monty Python has something to say not only about history and literature but about literary history; in its very aesthetic form, this film reminds us that the standard linear narrative is not the only way of organizing a story. Many medieval stories are likewise structured either allegorically or with significant disruptions, such as this film has, that reveal that a story is something that is constructed and has its gaps and interventions.

In the ""Age of the Da Vinci Code"" -- another far less successful Grail story --  I'd be happy to see folks go back to Monty Python for their understanding of medieval literature and Chrisitainity. Maybe they'd learn that all enigmas are not meant to be solved; some are meant to be the topic of cleansing and cathartic laughter.",1148083200,12,2335,4.888888888888889

25784,5,0767824571,"Surprisingly I first watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail while I was in high school. Now when I say I was in high school, I mean I was actually sitting in English Lit class as a learning experience. Not surprisingly, this class was taught by the same teacher who gave away beer mugs, which he tried to convince everyone were milk mugs. Needless to say this was the greatest class I had in my educational career.

But the great thing about Monty Python I that it actually works on an educational level with high brow comedy that the uneducated may not get. There were plenty of references that dealt with obscure British history may not get so while watching it in class we would watch a scene and laugh at it's sophomoric humor, then the teacher would rewind it and point out the little things that us, the uneducated wouldn't get, then have a laugh at the deeper meaning.

Yet it is still the silliness that draws people to the Monty Python franchise, and there is plenty of that in the Holy Gail. In addition to the French dude that uttered the title phrase, some of my personal favorite parts are, the Black Knight who wouldn't die, the Holy Hand Grenade and the Knights Who Say Ni. And as part of the English Lit class, we learned the ""Ni"" was actually a curse word back in olden times, so for me that added to the humor of the scene.

And unlike virtually every DVD released, the all the extras are worth checking out and also boasts what I think is the only movie that offers for your listening pleasure a ""Mono soundtrack in glorious old-fashioned mono!"" Plus as an added bonus there is ""A glorious 24 seconds absolutely free!"" although don't ask me where that is from. There are also there rare audio commentaries that are actually interesting, one with Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones and another with John Cleese, Eric Idle, and Michael Palin. Also there a plenty of great documentaries, three sin-alongs, and a cast directory to keep track of how many characters each actor played. And if you can't get enough ridiculousness, you can watch the film in Japanese with English Subtitles as they search for the holy sake cup and even a Lego version of the film.

Then I saw this movie on Cinemax around 1982...and again the following day.  (By the way, Spiny Normal gives it two prickly thumbs up...Dinsdale!)  After which I promptly went out and bought...*dramatic pause*...a SHRUBBERY!! *Dramatic music!*  I laughed, I cried, I wet my pants (well, all right, not really), I did a few Silly Walks.

The genius of the Pythons simply cannot be overstated.  Holy Grail was made on a shoestring budget, yet the lads managed to wring the maximum amount of laughs and silliness out of the Arthurian legends to great effect on that budget.  From the use of coconuts to imitate the sound of hoofbeats, to the burning of a witch because she's made of wood and floats on water like a duck (""Cor, she turned me into a newt!"" ""A newt?!"" ""(Long pause)...I got better...""), to Castle Anthrax and lots of good spankings, to the Bridge of Death (""WHAT...is your favourite COLOUR?!"" ""Blue!"" ""Very well, then, off you go.""), there's nary a wrong step here.  The bonus materials are a bit of fun, too; I must add that the subtitles make the lines easier to understand as well.  They make it much easier for you and your friends to spend countless hours quoting the film back and forth at each other...and the lines are VERY quotable.

And the general quality of the film in the special edition is greatly improved; the prior DVD release had muddy sound and murky images, and while the film was enjoyable nevertheless, you still felt a little cheated--after all, the DVD is supposed to be an improvement over the old VHS.

Those who say its unfunny and stupid, and those who say ""I just don't get it"". Well the ironic thing is the people who say its stupid really just don't get, either.
  I suppose it depends on your sense of humor. If you have a deep, layered, and intricate sense of humor, you will find Mony Python funny (and no, I am not kidding). If your sense of humor is less developed, more of a crudely constructed singular grasp of what 'humor' is, chances are you will not find Monty Python funny. Or, I may just not know what the hell I'm talking about.
  The real joke here is that on the surface, it appears there is nothing to 'get' about the humor that runs rampant in the Monty Python sketches. It all seems so simple and juvenile. Well, that's the true genius of the Python troupe. Their comedy is actually QUITE complex, and works on several different levels.
The fact that they make it all look so easy is amazing to me. Holy Grail is the best of the Python movies, and has SO many classic moments its hard to remember them all. My personal favorite is Lancelot getting frisked at the end.
  If you have never seen a Monty Python project, this is the one to start with. You will either find it funny, or you won't, and you will then know which group you belong to.

 The movie starts out with King Arthur (Graham Chapman) and his loyal servant Patsy (Terry Gilliam) galloping...wait, is Patsy clapping two coconuts together to symbolize a horse running? Wacky! Then they encounter a man above in a castle who won't let them past because he doesn't understand where they got the coconuts. Then a man collecting bodies (Eric Idle) during the Black Plague is swindled by another man (John Cleese) to kill a perfectly healthy old man because he'll be dead soon anyway. Need I go on? Okay, Arthur bickers with a 37-year-old beggar named Dennis, who he mistakes for a beggar woman, and he encounters the Black Knight (Cleese again), who even with no legs and arms, never gives up (""I'll bite your legs off!""). Arthur recruits Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones, also directing), who is in a heated argument about whether or not a woman (Connie Booth) is a witch and suggests weighing her against a duck (don't ask).

There are probably precious few souls who haven't seen this at least once, so there's little I can add about the movie itself that hasn't already been praised in earlier reviews.

25798,5,0767824571,"Terry Jones, the co-director of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", once said that comedy is defined as two disparate forces coming together and colliding.  That definition may not fit into all varieties of comedy, but for the Monty Python crew and especially this movie it does.  Almost all the scenes in this movie are true masterpieces of this definition of comedy,  whether it is a medieval serf spouting off neo-Marxist thought, or the ancient enchanter named ""Tim"".  This film also contains the greatest `deus ex machina' ending in the history of cinema with police interrupting Arthur's last glorious charge.  On a personal note, the first time I saw this movie at about the age of 15 on PBS, I did not know what to think.  When the film ended with the camera being confiscated by the authorities, I said to my father: ""What happened?""  My Dad responded ""I guess they ran out of film...you know PBS.""

The DVD special features are well worth it too, with an insightful director's commentary and a trip with Jones and Palin touring the sites where the movie was filmed.",1131840000,7,1244,4.618181818181818
25799,5,0767824571,"If you know and love this movie, you should get this Collector's Edition asap: the extras are fabulous, and the special ""High Definition"" presentation with ""pink frilly edges"" looks just as gloriously bad as it does on any other DVD released so far. For a movie set in Middles Ages and shot in the 1970s, it's better than what you might expect. The packaging is really shoddy, with a famous glue strip that tried to break the extras DVD when I attempted to remove it from the box. Once I accomplished the extraction, I struggled for a long while, trying to figure out how to place the second DVD back in the cumbersome box of not-quite-so-sturdy construction, which basically fell apart after opening. However, is it not in the spirit of Monty Python, to have this opus magnum housed in a box whose condition mimics this of the cheap collapsing Camelot model in the film? I placed the second DVD in an empty plastic box and proceeded to discover the wonders of this deranged collection- which is great beyond words.
For starters, there is The Senitype, ""a single 33-milimeter frame from the original motion picture negative"", which comes framed in a cardboard file describing how to start collecting the yearly editions of the frame and warns you that while it is not a laxative.... well, you need to get the box to find out the rest.
The print edition of the script, the singalongs, the documentaries, the subtitles for People Who Don't Like the Film, the Japanese version of the movie and the Lego Block version of the Camelot Scene (my favourite!).. It will take you a couple of hours, at least, to go through the whole magnificent lot.
This is one collector's edition which lives up to its title, and it does it to the optional soundtrack in ""glorious old-fashion mono"", and animated menus with ""very loud surround sound."" Highly recommended.",1130803200,7,1846,4.736024844720497
25800,5,0767824571,"I always have this disconcerting bafflement and not a little bit of annoyance whenever I teach my ""Comedy Unit #1"" to my sophomore English students.  I wrap my ""Comedy Unit"" in a cloak of pseudo-science so that I can watch funny stuff while being able to justify it to the administration (should they walk in when I am showing a clip from ""Young Frankenstein"").  I make the students write a definition essay at the end, ""What is Comedy?"" as part of our state curriculum requirements. Anyway........we study the various types of comedy: slapstick, parody,satire, scatological, etc.  Then as an example of a movie that incorporates almost every type of comedy, I show ""Monty Python and the...""  I still find it hilarious and as I watch it over and over again, I am struck anew each time when I see how smart it is.  Here's my question:  I see each year that the smarter the kid the harder they laugh.  I don't mean to sound elitist but my honors classes hoot and holler.  My ""general"" students, who are proud of having read ""a"" book in middle school, sometimes laugh at the slapstick and then there are a significant number who mutter the whole time, ""This is so stupid, why are we watching this? This is stupid....and so on."" I start to get fed up after the first two mutters because:  1) They could be deconstructing *War and Peace* if I was in a really bad mood and  2) I love this movie.  I warn them ahead of time that they might not ""get"" all of the satire (peasant/king political debate) but how can you resist a line about a moist bit throwing scimitars at you  or a watery tart etc.  This movie is very, very smart and very, very funny.  Anyway, I propose we throw out the traditional IQ test and show this to high schoolers to assess their intelligence or at least intellectual potential.  How can you not love this movie?

25801,4,0767824571,"When I was a teenager, I looked at the few infomercials stating the Monty Python series on VHS and DVD, I thought the series was just filler. But later, as I grew older, some of my relatives introduced me to one of its films--The Holy Grail. Through that hour-and-a-half I was laughing so hard at everything the movie represented. And as time wore, I was watching the TV series itself, and that show was actually a little better than what I expected.

Now appreciating the entire franchise itself, I managed to pick up the Holy Grail movie itself on a 2-disc Special Edition DVD for $14 at a locat Target store and I was freaking happy.

What exactly is the movie about? Well, this is the retelling of the story of King Arthur, his uniting with the Knights of the Round Table at Camelot, and of course, the search for the Holy Grail--all told in a British humor fashion. Pointless, you may say, but still funny as hell nonetheless. And what a funny crew of Knights of Camelot, too; we have: Arthur, King of the Britons, Sir Bedevere the Wise (I think), Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Gallahad the Pure, and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot. When a new strategy was planned along the way though, the Knights split up and went seperate ways to find the Grail, and that's when the comedy ensues. You'll see Sir Robin meet a giant three-headed knight whose three heads bicker at each other; Sir Gallahad run into a castle filled with sex-driven maidens; Sir Lancelot try to rescue a princess locked in a castle only to find out it's really a wussy prince trying to escape from being forced by his father to marry someone in favor of the bride's landscape; and King Arthur and Sir Bedevere meet the Knights who say ""Ni!"" that order the two to find a shrubbery with their necks at stake. In addition you'll find the entire crew meet up a castle full of disrespectful French and a certain rabbit...

Now on to the DVD itself. The video quality here has been remastered, but not restored; the picture is still grainy and muddy, but the colors are bright and solid nonetheless. The audio  quality could've been better, though. Although we do get a Dolby Mono soundtrack, it's pretty muffled, just like in the VHS copy. The Dolby 5.1 track, though, is much clearer than the mono, but doesn't thump the entire house-a good track anyway.

As with the extras, there's plenty to keep you happy. The first disc contains two fun commentary tracks by the Pythonites themselves and a Pop-up video track for storyboard comparisons.
Also included are subtitles ""for people who don't like the film"". There's also an extra 24 seconds added in the film...

Disc Two carries the bulk of the extras. For starters, we have two fun featurettes: ""The Quest For the Holy Grail Locations"" where Terry Jones and Michael Palin show which landscapes were the entire movie shot; and ""How to use your Coconuts"", an interesting feature on how to carve your coconut to a point where you can start banging them to make a trotting horse sound.
Also there's an interesting newscast featurette called ""On Location with the Pythons"", where the BBC News crew talks to the Python crew about the making of the film. In addition you'll also get art and photo galleries, it's theatrical trailer, Three Sing-alongs from the film, and a few more pointless features for the Python fan.

In conclusion, I still like the film as much as the DVD treatment here. And I appreciate the show itself,too. So buy this film and enjoy this film...

The first disk we received was defective, with a long scratch or substance of some kind engrained into the surface. We had it replaced by Amazon and this time the disk had two streaks of what we suspect may be glue on it, which caused the disk to skip very badly in play and even jump over scenes. We were eventually able to buy some CD cleaner and to get this off with a lot of effort -- we were desperately anxious to own this great film!

The other issue is that the round spindle on which the disk is mounted in the case is made of such rigid plastic that it is very difficult to get the disk off it (this was true for both versions we had here). We managed to finally very carefully crush the sides of the spindle with a pair of pliers enough to get the disk out, but I think it would be very easy to crack the disk if removing it by hand.

It is unfortunate that these manufacturing issues should lower the value of this amazing film, which is one of the funniest ever made. The box includes a script, which is great to read, and we now finally know all the words to the Camelot song thanks to the sing-along included in the extras!",1126656000,4,1261,4.206611570247934
25805,5,0767824571,"Not only is Monty Python and the Search for the Holy Grail one of the funniest films ever made and a classic of Western Cinema, the folks across the pond have set a new standard for DVDs.

If you are a fan of British comedy or are the kind of person who would find catapulting a wooden rabbit funny, this is your kind of film.  I have yet to run into someone who has seen it who walked away disappointed; I have found far more people who will quote from it at the drop of a hat.

The plot is relatively simple: the gang are playing Arthur, Lancelot, Gallahad and others in the search for the Holy Grail.  Along the way Arthur has to use the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch to take out a killer rabbit while Gallahad (the Pure) has to be rescued from nymphomaniacs.  As a word of warning if this is your first time watching the film, the ending comes suddenly and you may be confused if there's more; when the music starts, the film is done.

The features on this DVD are up to the high standards of Monty Python.  Although the film has not been noticably restored, when you get right down to it you don't watch Monty Python for the speical effects.  There are subtitles in several languages, including a set for people who don't like the movie (the subtitles in that case are taken from Henry IV, Part II, though they are out of sequence to go along with the action on screen).  They have redone parts of the film in Lego.  They have a sing-along.  They have an instructional film on how to use coconuts.  In other words, there are a lot of unique to bizarre features that will keep you entertained for hours.

This DVD is a rare two-for-one: if you've never seen Monty Python before, it's an exellent introduction to what is probably their best-known work.  If you are a big Monty Python fan, you get a ton of features to entertain you, not to mention the film.

Everything is well thought out and executed in true Python style. From the coconuts and the swallows to the witch burnings and killer bunny, this movie has it all: absurdity, humour, erm...tragedy? Ok not that really, but anyway. The storyline is simplistic but of course there are massive deviations from the actual story thanks to the British Police and various French K-nighits that constantly impede King Arthur's noble quest to find the Holy Grail. The whole Python group deliver a dynamite performance filled with fall-over-laughing skits and absurd situations, whether it's the difficulty of building a castle in a swamp or using a Trojan Rabbit to infiltrate the French Fortress.

The extras on the DVD include old movie posters and drawings for Nostalgic fans, an extra short on the use of coconuts (which I found incredibly useful for training swallows), Various sing-a-longs icluding a Lego Knight Version of the ""Camelot"" song and trailers from various films. All in all, this DVD has the most extra material on it for Python fans, so much so that it's on a whole other DVD. That's right, 2 DVDs! What more could you ask for?

If you love political and social satire, any Monty Python will have you laughing your head off. But if you like it in a Medieval setting, then ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" will be your cup of tea delivered by a European Swallow (African Swallows are larger but are non-migratory).

King Arthur is never allowed to become an heroic figure since almost no one respects his authority, and the Knights are variously too bloodthirsty or too cowardly.  The world they inhabit, of lustful maidens, killer rabbits and vindictive enchanters, hilariously parodies the Arthurian legend.

For instance, take the famed Black Night scene, where Arthur cuts the black night's arms and legs off. The black night insists that these losses of limbs are ""only flesh wounds"" and fights on.

But I would have to say that the humor just isn't there for me the rest of the way. Some border on infantile while others border on what the hell did I just see. It was that awful.

The mythic roots are too powerful and survive far beyond any other circumstance or religious belief.

Monthy Phyton makes a fantastic turn of page about this legend and precisely due its black humor doses, put us in context with some revelations that can not be told by reasons politically correct.

Thirty years have elapsed since its original release, but it is still a movie that veers wildly back and forth between hilariously inventive and downright silly.  If you can hold on tight, it's a worthwhile ride. Almost arbitrarily about a band of adventurers looking for the famed Holy Grail, the movie is just an excuse to create a nonsensical world steeped in medieval history and comically ironic violence. Directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, it is typical Monty Python fare, which means a lot of clever wordplay and elaborate sight gags with big payoffs. The story begins with King Arthur and his page Patsy galloping on their invisible horses with their clapping coconut half-shells, as they search for worthy knights to take back to Camelot. From there, we meet a cast of characters that only makes sense in Python-land: an increasingly armless and legless Black Knight with a chip on his shoulder, a big Trojan Horse-like wooden rabbit, some disrespectful Frenchmen, castle-bound nymphomaniac maidens, the knights who dare to say ""Ni!"", a pedantic historian in the present day and even God, who seems rather impatient with the befuddled knights as He explains their quest for the Holy Grail. Amid these disparate elements, the film holds together as a clever satire on blind pious ignorance and the unquestioning acceptance of organized religion. The pacing gets sluggish toward the end, but the conclusion is riotous and just in time.

Well packaged, the two-disc set has several extras. The main menu on the first disc is funny in itself with an option for the hard of hearing. There are two alternative commentary tracks. The first is newer and features Idle, John Cleese and Michael Palin; the second was recorded much earlier with Gilliam and Jones. Both are informative but only fitfully funny since they defer to the movie. The second disc has ""Mindless Sing-Alongs!"", where three scenes are taken from the film and subtitled so that once can sing along to the amusing ""Knights of the Round Table"" (which inspired the Broadway show title, ""We dine well here in Camelot, we eat ham and jam and spam a lot.""), ""Sir Robin"" or chant along in ""Monk's Chant"". There is a hysterical little ""educational"" short entitled ""How to Use Your Coconut"" and two scenes dubbed in Japanese. But the highlight is a 45-minute documentary called ""The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations,"" in which Jones and Palin explore the various film locations with humor and a sense of deserved nostalgia. Other features include a mock interview with the cast done during the filming, a Lego version of ""The ""Knights of the Round Table"" song and various sundry features suitable primarily for a Pythonite. For non-Pythonites, the film is still worth a look at a comedy that only looks better with all the witless dreck produced now.",1114473600,11,2985,4.956087824351298

25839,5,0767824571,"King Arthur and his knights embark on a low-budget search for the Grail, encountering many very silly obstacles.

That is the tagline from the Internet Movie Database, and at the end of the day (and this reviewing session) I could not come up with a better way of describing the film. What do you get when you give about 230,000 to a couple of debutante directors and the rest of the members of the greatest comic collective the world has ever seen? Monty Python And The Holy Grail!

Monty Python And The Holy Grail is a truly great film and in particular a truly great comedy - to still generate laughs even after repeated viewings.

What is the film about? King Arthur (Graham Chapman) is seeking knights to join him in the court of Camelot, and after some run-ins with the French, eventually gathers together Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones), Sir Lancelot (John Cleese), Sir Galahad the Chaste (Michael Palin) and Sir Robin the Not So Brave (Eric Idle). After not returning to Camelot for reasons well detailed in the film, the knights are confronted by God who gives them an awesome task - to find the Holy Grail. Now the fun really begins! They have to confront the dangers of The White Rabbit and The Bridge Of Death in order to seek what they hope to find. Many months pass before the possibility of success finally arrives. But then again, perhaps not. In case you are wondering, Terry Gilliam plays the part of Patsy - Arthur's ""horse"" - but like everyone else also plays a bunch of other parts, so typically Monty Python. Not so typically Monty Python is the fact that apart from Dennis's mother, all female parts are actually played by females!

With classic comedy scenes aplenty - you must have seen the Black Knight scene surely? - that still are as funny today as they were twenty five odd years ago, this is truly a gem of a film. What this bunch of comic geniuses managed to achieve on a shoestring budget remains one of the pre-eminent comedy classics, ranking up there with the likes of Buster Keaton's The General. Okay, it looks cheap and nasty at times, but you really would be hard-pressed to make any complaint - there are plenty of way over-budget Hollywood pieces of tripe that could not even approach the delights of this film with one hundred times the budget. And this was but one of their classic films! When you add into the mix a collection of some of the funniest gag subtitles during the opening credits, the inspired surprise opening and everything else, this is a true classic DVD release.

Monty Python fans have been awaiting this sort of local release for far too long and to finally have it is to emphasise why. Whilst the film urges you to run away frequently, the only direction you should be running is towards your nearest DVD retailer to order this DVD. Brilliant stuff all through, and an essential purchase for any DVD collection.",1104192000,3,2871,4.599609375
25840,5,0767824571,"Yes this movie is one of the funniest, goofiest, weirdest movies i have ever seen.

They run into things like goofy French knights, three headed knights, knights who say ""Ni"",fortune tellers, a castle full of hot chicks, an enchanter, and finally, a killer bunny rabit with nasty , big, pointy teeth.

""It's only a flesh wound!"" ""Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?"" ""The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch"" ""Answer me these questions three!""

Each of these quotes will immediately be recognized by Grail fans. The list of memorable lines and sight gags goes on and on.

The film itself is the greatest of all comedies by the greatest of all comedy troupes. No small intellect is behind the script, and no insignificant amount of historical knowledge either. The actors avoid playing their parts with self-knowing irony, which gives viewers the a chance to get (or miss) the humor on their own. As much fun as the film are the director's commentaries and various shorts depicting the search for castles (not as easy as it might be supposed) and the shooting of the film itself. Two sad truths: Graham Chapman is no longer with us and John Cleese has developed into (perhaps always was?) an insufferable bore. Ah well, I'm over it.

On a purely quote-by-quote basis, this beats out This Is Spinal Tap, The Life Of Brian, A Fish Called Wanda, Army Of Darkness, Blazing Saddles, and Young Frankenstein. COMBINED. The opening credits sequence alone has more jokes crammed in it than an entire hour of Saturday Night Live (and that's pre-1996 SNL, mind you).

25854,4,0767824571,"There are so many things about this (and indeed any) Monty Python movie that one hardly knows where to begin. Nothing is left out of the mix--history, religion, politics, personal relationships, prejudices, intellectual prowess or the lack thereof. My title, of course, comes from an early scene in with Arthur approaches a castle, inexplicably occupied by French k-nigits, who claim to already have a grail.

The Monty Python troupe, led by the creative talents of Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, incorporated John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle and Graham Chapman as King Arthur, the dominant role in the film.  No animals were harmed in the filming, not even an African Swallow, non-migratory as they are.  A few coconuts bit the dust, however, as did more than a few comic images.  Logic bits the dust, too, on more than one occasion.  I did a paper once for symbolic logic which I was told ten years later was still being passed about because I had dared to use something so unconventional as this Monty Python movie in the references (I couldn't see why that wouldn't be much more common, and indeed, hope it is today--I use 'Life of Brian' in homilies, so why not this film in logic?).

The particular logical incident (or rather, illogical incident) involves the trial of a woman accused of being a witch. Through 'logic' it is demonstrated that she would be a witch if she weighed the same as a duck (which, surprisingly enough, it turns out that she does -- 'It's a fair cop' she concedes as the general rejoicing commences at the prospect of a bonfire).  Those who have benefit of the 'Executive Version of the Soundtrack of the Trailer of the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail' are also treated to an exposition of the logical problems which itself concludes that 'sex is better than logic'. And who could argue with that reasoning?

However, my favourite scene would have to be the liturgical procession and reading of instructions for the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, with the leader's instruction 'skip a bit, brother' -- an instruction which I've searched in vain in the liturgical handbooks, but would vastly improve many readings on some mornings in church. This is a perfect parody of the sonorous but deadening readings that seem to drag on interminably.

A close second would be the scene in which Arthur tries to explain his kingship to members of an autonomous collective (read, peasants without a lord) who view him as just another oppressor, and inform him that watery tarts throwing swords at you is not an adequate basis for the exercise of supreme executive power.

Those who have visions of Great Britain as royal and cultural icons are often amazed-the likes of Monty Python and Benny Hill (among others) show the inhabitants of the UK as just as human (if not moreso) than the rest of the world. And we are all the richer for it.  Alas, the Holy Grail is never actually attained by the seekers, who run into trouble with more French k-nigits and the local constabulary. But, the journey's the thing, so they teach me in seminary, and thus, this journey is well worth following to the end.

25857,5,0767824571,"Who would have  thought that, after nearly 30 years, the world's goofiest movie could be made even moreso?  Not only is this DVD a comedy triumph (it would be simply if it were the DVD version of the classic film, in which a crew too broke to afford horses for King Arthur and his Knights changed history and college kids' banter forever by introducing coconuts as migrating props). Oh, no, this DVD is one that may become a standard for other DVDs.  Just look at this list of extras above!  To be sure, some of them are fluff.  The ""load of rubbish"" selection is simply some receipts and a few odd notes.  But most of it is stupendous.
The first disc contains the movie itself, along with some choices of how to watch it.... subtitles, commentary by directors Terry Jones & Terry Gilliam or by John Cleese & Eric Idle & Michael Palin. Then ""for people who don't like the film"", there's subtitles from Shakespeare's ""Henry IV, Part II"".  Now, these  do not faithfully follow Henry IV verse by verse, but they do come from the play, and it's hilarious how the phrases Shakespeare wrote do actually match up with the action on the screen.
Disc Two contains several mementoes:  a film of John Cleese, Terry Jones, and ""Grail"" production manager John Young (who also played the hapless ""Historian"" towards the end of the film, and the ""I'm not dead!"" guy) paying a return visit to Castle Doune , in 2000.  At first it's fun to hear them reminisce at the filming site, but since it's a very small spot with nothing but a wall and a bit of ground, they appear uncomfortable and that  quickly gets old. More interesting is the home movie made by the two Terries when they looked for prospective film locations in the seventies. Their excitement is palpable.
A somewhat painful scene (except for the chance it gives us to watch Terry Jones in action as a director) is the BBC documentary made during filming. The interviewer seems more interested in trying to be funny himself than in the Pythons.  But there are several great comic extras, including words to some songs, a coconut skit, two scenes dubbed in Japanese, and best of all, an animated feature of the ""Camelot"" scene and song done entirely in Lego...must be seen to be believed.

I find that the funniest films are not necessarily the ones that make you laugh the most, but rather the ones that make you recite all the great lines for days, weeks, months, even years on end. ""Holy Grail"" is one of the prime cinematic examples of my theory (alongside ""Caddyshack"" and every Mel Brooks movie ever made). Acting as a comedy in an epic's clothing, ""Holy Grail"" follows the quest of King Arthur and his brave knights on their quest to reclaim the elusive and shiny Holy Grail. As they set out, they encounter the entire alumni of the Weird Movie Characters Hall of Fame. From rude Frenchman to economic savvy peasants to paraplegic Black Nights. These are the real heroes of the film, considering that they are the ones that make us laugh the most. But what is it, truly, that makes this the single funniest film ever made? The one-liners, the best in any movie ever made (second only perhaps to ""Fletch""). You know them all, so I don't even have to say them, and if you don't, well, then go see the movie.

25870,5,0767824571,"This new packaging of the Monty Python classic is to be cherished by Python fans as much (if not more) for the extras as for the film itself. I have always been a Python fan, and must confess that I actually prefer the series to the films, but the classic scenes in this film make it a must see.
The film was shot on a shoestring budget (funded largely by rock music celebrities) in horrible, wet weather by a small cast and crew, with direction from first time directors Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam. The net result is a quasi-historical, utterly warped film about King Arthur (Graham Chapman) and his knights in their search for the Holy Grail. Many entertaining diversions follow, including encounters with the 'Knights Who Say Ni' (my very favorite part of the entire film), a killer rabbit, plus a visit to the surprisingly appealing Castle Anthrax.
The extras are what make this version so desirable. Included on the two disc set are numerous diversions, including a couple of documentaries (one made in 1974 on location, and one made for this release.) One of the highlights of this package is the documentary ""The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations!"" in which Terry Jones and Michael Palin take us on visits to the locations where the film was shot. It is a very interesting and entertaining documentary with footage from the movie compared with how the areas look now; of particular interest are the interior views of the castles.
Also included is a collectible film cel made for this edition and a printed copy of the screenplay, so you can follow along, or clear up hard to decipher lines. This and many other little gems on the CD's (such as two scenes from the Japanese version, and a skit in which an older Michael Palin demonstrates uses for coconuts) make this a worthwhile addition to any video library.",1073779200,,1821,4.69375
25871,4,0767824571,"Python have been gurus in my life since I was a kid in the 70s.  I've always liked their absurd attacks on every institution in the world, and their staggering creativity and originality.  Their TV show is still my favorite thing they've done, but Grail has more than enough to make it classic.  I love the filmmaking of this film--Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam are working on a pitiful budget, on location, and for the most part this looks great.  Imagine if people in the middle ages had cameras and decided to make a documentary--it might look a lot like this.  These directors are clearly knowledgeable about artistic films from directors such as Ingmar Bergman, and their knowledge gives the movie a texture and tone you just don't find in comedies.  But this isn't just any comedy.  If you're looking for something light and fluffy, you won't find it here.  Even the rabbit is a vicious killer!  Take the scene early in the film with the guy collecting dead bodies in a plague village for a fee.  The animal and human dung, the groans of terminal illness, a cat being beaten to death against a wall, then a man being beaten to death for ""nine pence""--you get the idea.  But nevertheless the scene is funny.  If you like that scene you'll like the rest of the film.  Still, it is a mighty angry movie.  It condemns the violence behind legends like King Arthur (a towering performance from Graham Chapman, absolutely convincing, one of the finest straight men--even though in real life he was gay--in a movie comedy), organized religion, and western philosophy.  One more thing--the characters who make me laugh the most are Tim the Enchanter, Roger the Shrubber, and the Old Man on The Bridge of Death.  (Terry Gilliam's presence as actor and director and animator on the movie is a marvel--a great way to see how his career as a great director started.)  Like all Python films it has peaks and valleys; some scenes last too long, some are based on a thin concept, some push it as far as mixing the gruesome and the madcap, like the Tale of Sir Lancelot where John Cleese as Lancelot slaughters or otherwise brutalizes a bunch of women, children, and old men at a wedding, rather bloodily--too much here, I think.",1073692800,3,2218,4.6461538461538465
25872,5,0767824571,"From the trumpet flourish at the beginning of the film, followed by the approach of Arthur galloping on foot with the sounds of coconuts being smacking against one another by his minstrel, to the climactic finish of the film, when the Knights of Camelot are seized while attacking a French Castle for actions against a news commentator earlier in the film, has history been so humorously re-""created"" as it has been in this brilliantly funny film by the British Troupe of comedic actors known affectionately by fans world wide as ""Monty Python"".
""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is a tongue-in-cheek look at the lore surrounding the Arthurian Legend and his quest for the Holy Grail.  The film pulls no punches, taking jabs at everything from the political strife between the French and the British, the Catholic Church, the Inquisition, the British Aristocracy and just about every legend and myth surrounding King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable.
When Arthur (Graham Chapman) is approached by God to discover the secret resting place of the Holy Grail, he at once sets out on a quest to find it, picking up his entourage of knights along the way: Sir Lancelot the Brave (John Cleese), Sir Launcelot (Eric Idle), Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones), and Sir Galahad the Pure (Michael Palin).
While on their quests, each face a variety of hilarious challenges, including the construction of a Trojan Rabbit, the approach of Castle Anthrax with the multidle of Vestial Virgins,
the rabbit with ""big, pointy, teeth"", and of course, the Knights who say ""Ni"".
Originally filmed in 1975, the movie has become a cult-classic, and a favorite for many generations of Monty Python enthusiasts.  Considered by many to be their most successful feature film, the Holy Grail relies on a careful combination of slapstick humor combined with clever writing and high-brow British wit.  Though some of the humor relates to the period the film was shot, most of it transcends any generation, poking fun at history with an originality and absurdity that is funny and entertaining.
Make sure to pay close attention to the many characters throughout the film, for many of the ""Python"" principals play more than one character.  In many instances, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones can be seen carrying on conversations with themselves.  Its one of the many hilarious twists that the Monty Pyhton troupe use in their films.
This is a great film for anyone who has yawned their way through a world history class in high-school or college.  It brings a slanted and hilarious version of history to life in a way that only the men of Monty Python can.

25873,4,0767824571,"No one can appreciate such a film, such a grotesque and even clownish film, if they do not understand British humour. Everything is systematically put upside down. You will not laugh your head off, and yet everything is funny, but mostly funny strange or funny just plain silly rather than funny AhAh. Every scene is an allusion to an element that comes from English culture or from standard films on or around Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, and it is made silly in a way or another. The creativity of Monty Python is immense and probably bottomless, that's why you can't spank him really. It is never gross and yet it is not far from it. And the funniest part is of course the deep anti-French humour that nearly opens and closes the film. Only the French can pour s**t on the head of a crowned English king. But they do. Monty Python also likes anachronisms and does not hesitate to bring some real modern cops into his picture and they even arrest the crowned King Arthur and make him climb into the black maria. No problem for that humorist. And the cops even block the camera, though they do not destroy the film. Some might say that they could have done that to save us an hour and a half of s**t, but that would be unfair because after all there is something fascinating in such exaggerated and overblown humour. Nothing is sacred with them and that may revive your self-criticism to see such ridiculing of what is considered as everyday banality.

25875,5,0767824571,"After making a film version of their best Flying Circus bits (And Now For Something Completely Different), the Pythons wanted to make an original movie. They realized that the quest for the Holy Grail would lend itself nicely to a series of sketches focusing on each knight. For a climax, they planned on sending the knights into Herrods department store to buy the grail (because, after all, Herrods sells everything).
But somewhere along the way, this collection of medieval skits became one of the best comedies ever made. You could credit the use of authentic sets and costumes. For some reason, making the movie historically accurate makes it funnier. Or you could credit the way they used their painfully low budget --- like using different sides of a castle to represent multiple castles in the story. If you notice it, you get an extra laugh. Or you could credit the use of two directors, forcing everyone to get it right the first time to avoid two sets of solutions to every problem.
Whatever the reason, Monty Python and the Holy Grail holds up as one of the best comedies ever filmed. It still looks cheesy, but in a good way. The plot is full of nice big holes, too. Every time you see it, you notice something new and miss something you've memorized. The jokes don't wait for a laugh track. It's just one strange punchline after another.
For the special edition of the DVD, the five living Pythons put together a handful of extra bits. The best extras are the audio tracks. You hear the directors talk about set design, John Cleese complains about being wet and cold, and Michael Palin explains why everything is funny. The documentary in which the two Terrys (the directors) visit the old filming locations is fun, too. They still have their sense of humor about it all. If you like to laugh, you should buy this DVD and watch it over and over until you've memorized every line.

You can't really compare this with much of modern comedy since there is almost no scatological 'humor' like Austin Powers or Dumb and Dumber, but it still finds ways to tweak noses and offend sensibilities. It's also a bit irreverent but that's very minor compared to other films, just be warned if this offends you.
Overall, this is a very silly show. Even if you aren't in a silly mood when you sit down to watch it, that will change in under a minute.

The one thing about the collector's set that's kind of annoying, they have only one peg to put the DVDs onto so one of your DVDs is put directly on top of the other one.  The top disc tends to fall off the peg and could potentially get scratched in shipment (like my first one did before I exchanged it); also when you securely fasten the discs they can be kinda hard to take out.

EXTRAS
Alright, here's the real review.
On Disc One, there are two commentaries included.  One is by the co-directors, Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam.  The other is by the other 3 (surviving) Python members, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, and John Cleese.  Also on Disc One are some oddities such as subtitles from ""Henry IV, Part II.""
On Disc Two is the documentary, ""The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations"" whcih includes Terry Jones and Michael Palin traveling the English countryside, visiting the sites used in the movie and reliving old memories.  It's good, I promise!
Along with that is another documentary, shot on location in 1974 by the BBC on the production of the film, entitled ""On Location with the Pythons.""  Not much gets done, but it's fun to watch, and Graham Chapman goes off to catch a large do-do like creature, you know, with a beak.  Not really, he just describes it.
There is an education film, called ""How to Use Your Coconuts"" hosted by Michael Palin and a friend.  Not really educational at all, is it!?  But watch it anyways.
A short little segment with LEGO people performing the ""Camelot"" song.

25888,5,0767824571,"by far the best comedy period on my list. I laughed my love handles off watching this movie. my friends were right and I thank them for letting me see it. it's really, really great with awesome charcters like The Knights who say ""nee!"", Tim the Enchanter, The Killer Bunny, The old man at the bridge of death.
favorite part in that whole movie is when they meet the killer bunny. There are some other hilarious and memoriable parts like the Castle Anthrax with all the horned up maidens who want spankings and oral sex and the holy hand grnade of antioch. If anyone doesnt like this movie they ought to be shot.

25889,2,0767824571,"This is a great movie preformed by the legendary comedy troupe Monty Python.  I have nothing to say about the movie, other than everyone should watch it at least once even if you're not a Python fan.  This review is to serve as a warning to potential purchasers.  I purchased this movie only to find the discs were scratched due to a poor packaging design.  This 2 disc set stacks both discs one on top of the other on a single bracket, without a separator.  If you are unlucky like me the bracket was rather lose allowing the DVD's to rotate independently of one another, resulting in many tiny scratches rendering the feature DVD unreadable.  You can find the exact same features on the Special Edition (Wide Screen Edition) but without the movie cel and script, not to mention saving yourself some 20 bucks.",1063670400,2,810,4.590277777777778
25890,5,0767824571,"The very mention of this comedic masterpiece should be enough to bring a smile to your face. Widely regarded as the very peak of sketch comedy troupe Monty Python's career, The Holy Grail has nearly become as much of a religious establishment as the dark-aged deities it spoofs. There exist lunatics around the world who are able to not only directly quote lines from this film, but to recite the entirety of the script, from start to finish, without err. And, after just a single viewing, it's easy to find yourself tempted to join their ranks.
The story is simple enough, and yet manages to become intertwined and entangled within itself throughout the course of the brisk 89 minute run time. King Arthur, best known for his acquisition of the sword in the stone and subsequent leadership of the knights of the round table, is featured here as a blunt, modest man... oblivious to everything going on around him, and painstakingly patient through the most bizarre of circumstances. As the story unfolds, Arthur slowly gathers his knights, briefly visits Camelot and is charged by god to retrieve the infamous Holy Grail. The troupe embarks directly on their quest, without the slightest idea of where they're headed, and eventually runs into dozens of almost unrelated hurdles along the way.
In print, the premise sounds painfully unfunny... almost a joke unto itself. And, perhaps if they'd stuck to their guns about the whole ""knights in shining armor"" thing, that early judgment may have been partially right. But a great deal of what makes this so fun to watch is the way the characters interact with one another, address their environments and simply carry themselves. The Knights of the Round Table chat amongst each other in a very modern, almost twentieth century style. Formalities are few and far between, and supporting characters whose entire role in any other period piece would have been limited to ""Yes, sire, I'll retrieve my master this very moment"" are here given the chance to argue the finer points of foreign birds and migratory patterns. Unimportant lackeys dive into in-depth dissertations at the drop of a hat, spiraling off into a tangent with little or no provocation. Literally hundreds of medieval cliches are addressed and promptly disposed of throughout the course of the film, while simple, obvious visual puns are thrown out like darts at every moment. It's a film that anyone can enjoy, regardless of intelligence, age or demeanor. There's literally something for everyone.
Immediately, only seconds after popping this DVD into your hardware and hitting the ""play"" button, something is going to strike you as a little bit odd. Something's different about this classic, but it's tough to put your finger on it until the murky opening scenes are in the past. Bluntly enough, this new restoration looks BREATHTAKING. One of the toughest things to endure about the film's earlier VHS incarnations was the god-awful quality of the video, the way everything had been overtaken by a sort of yellowish-brown hue, darkened and muddied. However, this most recent DVD release cleans up those long-standing visual stains with uncanny precision, revealing in its wake an entirely new motion picture. Wide shots of the infamous ""Trojan rabbit"" scene are awesome sights, now that the original color saturation is in place. It's honestly as though someone took a cloth and some Windex to my television screen and wiped away thirty years' worth of dust and muck. The restoration alone is worth upgrading the copy of Holy Grail in your collection from VHS to DVD.
Fortunately enough, though, the crews in charge of this new DVD didn't stop there. With a full two discs in the set, almost every base is covered... in addition to several spots in between. The discs come fully equipped with two feature-length commentary tracks; one from directors Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, and another from John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin. The commentary tracks are both thoroughly interesting, with the directors' chat a little more insightful and the actors' track more disjointed. Jones and Gilliam reveal a lot of obscure facts about the creation of the film that I hadn't realized, such as the involvement of rock bands Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin in the production, and is generally a much better listen than its partner track. It's strange, it almost feels like Cleese, Idle and Palin weren't even in the same room together when they recorded these audio tracks, and that various comments from each were merely spliced together at appropriate points throughout the film.
The Special Features section is overflowing with options, including but not limited to three sing-alongs (featuring full lyrics to the film's three notable song-and-dance numbers... if you ever wondered what they were trying to say during the incomprehensible verses of ""We're Knights of the Round Table,"" today is your lucky day), a short film titled ""How to Use Your Coconuts"" (which comes off as very, very forced and very, very stupid), a cast directory (which shows just how many hats the actors wore throughout the course of the film; Michael Palin alone played nearly a dozen characters), photos and more. In addition, the second disc showcases two unique featurettes about the film; one which was shot on set in 1974 for the BBC, and another which reunites Gilliam and Jones in the year 2000, on the location of the main castle used throughout filming.
Without exaggeration, I seriously cannot recommend this DVD any higher. It's not humanly possible. Whether you're a devoted, lifelong Python fan or merely someone with a passing interest in comedy in general, this is a worthwhile purchase. You won't find a better transfer of the film in your life, the list of features is almost overwhelming, the original team is represented nearly in full, through dual commentary tracks and several featurettes, and it's very affordable at the same time. Go out and buy this now, before you forget.",1063584000,,5986,5.023138832997988

25898,5,0767824571,"If you have not seen this film, seriously, you've been deprived.  Monty Python was going strong in the late 60s/early 70s and after the show ended, the team decided to embark on a film project which led to ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail.""  Released in 1975, this film has stood the test of time and produced many fans around the world and developed cult status.  Monty Python followed up with two sequels (""Life of Brian,"" ""Meaning of Life""), but of the three this comedy marvel is still the strongest.
Even when it drags a bit in the middle, this is still a collection of funny moments.  Who can forget the Black Knight scene with its overexaggerated blood spilling and silly determination of the black knight?  How about the knights who say ni?  The bridge of death?  These scenes and more are outstandingly hilarious and are scenes that one CANNOT dispute the fact that they are indeed funny.
The Monty Python Gang put fine performances into the various different roles that they play in addition to the main characters.  The biggest standout for me was Graham Chapman as King Arthur, probably due to his commanding presence.
The film, directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones of the Python gang, is noticeably low budget, but you can tell they satired that with silly animation transitions and use of coconuts and political satire.  One of the few films with a low budget that is intentionally looking low budgeted.

25901,5,0767824571,"Of all the films and television programs produced by airborne members of the Flying Circus, I consider this to be their greatest achievement. Co-authored and then co-directed Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones (two rather silly people indeed), this film makes at least some effort to recreate a distant period in history and from a somewhat 20th century perspective. Apparently available funds were limited because Gilliam and Junes could not afford to rent horses and thus were forced to simulate them with body language and coconut half shells. Also, various members of the Ye Olde Merrie Companie were required to play several different roles...on occasion at the same time. For example, Graham Chapman as King Arthur as well as (or as unwell as) the Three-Headed Knight and the Hiccoughing Guard. Eric Idle ia also actively involved as Sir Robin, Maynard, Roger, a Guard, and the Historian Who Isn't A.J.P. Taylor...plus some other stuff my limited space precludes noting. One of Gilliam and Jones's cleverest strategies is to juxtapose 6th century Breton with 20th century England. Actually, not only juxtapose them but to have the former and latter interact without prior warning. Yes, this creates some confusion but the plot lags on fewer occasions and younger persons in the audience will feel more at home.
According to various historical sources, there was not one Arthur but hundreds...perhaps thousands in 6th century England. Indeed, here in Dallas in the year 2003, there are thousands of Arthurs now living in the North Texas region. How many kings? Ooodles of Kings but no kings; however, back then (i.e. 6th century), there were quite a few.
According to generally reliable research sources, for example, Geoffrey of Monmouth (about 1100-1155 A.D.) recorded Arthur as a High-King of Britain. He was the son of his predecessor, Uther Pendragon and nephew of King Ambrosius. As a descendant of High-King Eudaf Hen's nephew, Conan Meriadoc, Arthur's grandfather, had crossed the Channel from Brittany and established the dynasty at the beginning of the 5th century. The Breton King Aldrien had been asked to rescue Britain from the turmoil in which it found itself after the Roman administration had departed. He sent his brother, Constantine, to help. Constantine appears to have been the historical self-proclaimed British Emperor who took the last Roman troops from Britain in a vain attempt to assert his claims on the Continent in 407. Chronologically speaking, it is just possible he was King Arthur's grandfather. Arthur's Breton Ancestry was recorded by Gallet.
Of course, historical material such as this brought tears of joy to the eyes of both Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones (also their parents). They were inspired by it to bring the story of King Arthur and the Holy Grail to the sometimes silver screen. This they have done. Truly, the Pendragons are the stuff of legend. Predictably, Gilliam and Jones took certain liberties to achieve enhanced dramatic effect, adding some important new information revealed by their own historical research. For example, details about martial arts for quadriplegics, the Sepulcher of the Holy Grenade and its Killer Rabbit, aerodynamics of various species of migrating swallows, and interior decorating (e.g. curtains) in 6th century royal quarters. Exciting new stuff indeed.
Who said in 1974 that ""They just don't make great movies anymore""? Well, whoever said that could not be more wrong.

That's fine, this was my second Python movie ( after Eric the Viking) and I fell deeply for this humor.

25903,2,0767824571,"I'm not sure what it is that I don't like about this movie. It seems there is something off balance that is apparent from the opening sequence. Obviously all the reveiws for this movie were written by fans. Most people who wouldn't like this movie most likely have not heard of it, or barely remember. It does not leave a lasting impression unless you find it hilarious. Filmed on a shoestring budget and probably in locations within just a few miles of each other, this movie is a journey into the bizarre and dryer then a dessert humor of one of Englands most popular comedy troups. Rest assured, if you like English humor, this movie will most likely leave you rolling on the floor. For some who just can't laugh that hard at it, you may find yourself giving up on it early. There is some tremendously funny writing and some very cerebal wit. For example, the argument about whether a swallow can carry a coconut during it's migration. The taunting of the Frenchman from the top of the castle wall. The dual with the black knight, and the killer bunny. The hightlight being the peasent in the road who King Arthur mistakes for an old woman and gets a tougue lashing for the simple mistake. Even these moments though rely on the bizarre circumstance that these people don't ride horses but pretend to with the sounds they make with two coconuts to show you that there is absolutly nothing to be taken seriously and nothing that shouldn't be considered off the wall. This movie seems funnier when quoteing lines in the company of friends, rather then watching it straight out. My personal tastes do not run to something this unbalanced, but I realize it is adored by many. So to those who enjoy it, knock yourselves out. To those who enjoy more straight foward smart comedy, I would suggest Real Genius.",1055808000,5,1804,4.605590062111801
25904,5,0767824571,"I don't think I have ever laughed harder than I did the first time I saw MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL in a movie theater in Dallas, Texas while visiting my best friend in college Becky. I laughed so hard that I nearly hyperventilated, and I felt something like stabbing pain in my ribcage, so that the rest of the evening I had to grasp my chest with my arms to keep from hurting myself. I laughed and laughed and laughed, and then the opening credits ended and the film began.
As funny as the opening credits are, the film matches them. The skits are just off the chart absurd, and all the better for it. The film has penetrated popular imagination to such an extent that people aren't even aware sometimes of the origins of some of the things they hear. For instance, I played an online MMRPG (massively multiplayer role playing game), and in that game there were numerous players who played mages with some permutations of Tim, another named Brave Sir Robin, and one quest in the game was to get a gang of people to kill a tiny white rabbit that was capable of killing dozens of those attacking it. One group of players formed a monarchy called The Knights Who Say Ni. Outside that game, merely mentioning the words ""African swallow"" can evoke laughter in some quarters.
Even today, this movie remains one of the most original, intelligent comedies ever made. The entire conceit of making a comedy about King Arthur and the search for the Holy Grail is a bizarre one, but the Python boys pull it off with style. The skits (for there really is not a plot so much as a general framework for hanging great skits on) are extraordinarily intelligent, unusual, and, best of all, hysterically funny. To this day, except for other Monty Python films, there has been no humor along the lines in this film in either England or the United States, and that's a pity. This isn't easy humor to reproduce. It takes a certain amount education, a certain level of literacy, a certain level of intelligence, and very definitely a level of comic genius. What is brilliant is that the humor can move from highly cerebral political satire (the peasants who refuse to acknowledge Arthur as their king merely because he had been chosen by ""a watery tart"" who gave him Excalibur) to the delightfully absurd (the syllogisms by which a knight proves that a witch and a duck weigh the same, and then placing a duck on one side of a scale and the witch on the other, incredibly proving that she was indeed a witch) to the out and out farcical (the Black Knight).

While the Uses for coconuts featurette and the segments of the film as it was shown in other countries(subtitled) are just plain funny.

For those people, I can only have pity.
Because to love HOLY GRAIL is to establish a life-long friendship.  I've never known anyone who was lukewarm about the film.  Hate it (see above) and you just scratch your head in wonder at its popularity.  Love it,and you find yourself quoting it often and watching it over and over.  My family and I watch this movie at least once a year.  When my son (now 15) first watched this movie with me, I knew it was an important moment in our relationship.  Would he think his dad was weird for recommending this old British piece of junk?  Or would he join the club of fanatics?  Let's just say that we now own almost everything by Monty Python that is available on DVD and we're saving up for FAWLTY TOWERS.  For him, it was the Dark Knight's duel with King Arthur that first made him a believer.
I won't rehash the plot...that probably isn't possible.  But suffice it to say that I don't think anyone should skip this movie.  Yes, you might hate it.  If so, I'm sorry.  But there's a good chance you'll be sucked in and then you too can quote ""It's only a flesh wound"" or ""Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberry"" or ""There are those who call me...Tim.""  And you can enjoy, again and again, the vicious attacks of the white rabbit.  (If you have the DVD, I challenge you to watch the rabbit attack on super-slow motion...it's a historian's study on great film editing and it's also gut-bustingly funny!)  You can learn to count to five...uh, three.  You can learn to insult like the French.  And on and on.
The deluxe DVD set comes with a 2nd disc full of extras.  Not much of it is indispensible, but it's certainly worth the extra few bucks.

25911,5,0767824571,"I would just like to clear up a few issues that some of the sadly misled reviewers seem to harbor about this brilliantly funny film. First of all, I am deeply puzzled as to why an obvious farce (key word here: ""farce"") of medieval high-romance-type-stories must retain any modicum of historical accuracy.
By admitting confusion about the ""mistakes"" made in featuring a Trojan Rabbit, depicting Arthur and his knights as not having real horses, the fautly information regarding the actual weight African swallows are capable of carrying, and (here's a shocker) there IS NO castle Anthrax (!!!), some reviewers run the risk of making themselves appear terribly, terribly (and I am very sorry to have to say it) stupid.
For those of you who have apparently been losing sleep over these, and other questions raised by the movie, I offer a response. (And I'm really hoping the guy who was confused about the swallows carrying the coconuts was just kidding.)
The hilarity of this film is appreciated best by those of us WITH a solid understanding of British history and the actual legendary accounts of Arthur and his knights in medieval Britan. What makes it so funny is how it spoofs off the often ridiculous excesses of the tales. Knights being so incredibly ""chaste"" and determined to find the Holy Grail as to ignore a castle stuffed with gorgeous swooning virgins are found all throughout the pages of Malory's ""Morte d'Arthur"" and the tales of Chretien de Troyes. Read anything about Sir Galahad and you realize how intelligent the comedy is. A few other historical spoofs: seemingly impossible-to-kill knights (the black knight), Lancelot's vigor with his sword getting him into trouble as he valiantly kills scores of people with one stroke, mysterious knights in woods who demand a sacrifice (the knights who say ""ni!"")... etc...
Of course, there are a few extra Monty Pythonisms thrown in, such as amazing Killer Rabbits, Tim the Enchanter (who is Merlinesque, anyway) snubbing Frenchmen and a ridiculous witch burning, but everything is directed to the intelligent viewer who can watch it all and laugh out loud while still respecting the legends and stories the Pythons are making delicious fun of.
Oh, and by the way, clapping coconuts together instead of having real horses? That's FUNNY!! It isn't meant to be confusing! Please locate your missing sense of humor as quickly as possible!
I think this movie is hysterical, and worth watching. Those of you who feel otherwise, well, ""I blow my nose in your general direction!""",1048550400,3,2533,5.004739336492891
25912,5,0767824571,"For anyone not convinced there's a fine line between comedic genius and outright insanity, I recommend MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL.  The Python troupe takes the legend of King Arthur and mutates it into a hilarious kaleidescope of off-the-deep-end slapstick and parody.  Some of the humor is just plain silly (Black Knight:  ""Come on and fight, you coward!""  Arthur:  ""But I've just cut your leg off!""  Black Knight (pauses):  ""It's only a flesh wound.""), and we know it's silly, yet the viewer is still laughing uncontrollably.  Python can pull off looney tunes comedy like Olivier reciting Shakespeare; it's the reason the group enjoyed phenomenal success in the Seventies.
Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin move in and out of this film in a headspinning variety of roles.  From tapdancing knights to a killer rabbit to rude Frenchmen throwing livestock from the top of a castle, MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL is wacky, satisfying comic bliss.  By far the best of all the Python films.",1048204800,,1045,4.988439306358382
25913,5,0767824571,"Like myself, this review will be short and simple...
Monty Python, famous Brittish comedy troop whoose surreal and outragous sense of humour earned them a place in the Hall Of Hillarity, decide, with a barrel full of jokes and a matchbox full of money to make a movie.
This is the result, it's one of their best and my favourite, and I'm actually Brittish so I know what I'm talking about.
The DVD's extras are good; the commentaries being the highlight. Sound and picture quality too, for an old film, look superb.

25914,4,0767824571,"I wasn't sure I'd like ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" after all these years, but as soon as I popped in the videotype, I remembered exactly why I once found this film so funny.  The humor is incredibly irreverent and, after all these years, iconic.  Who can forget the argument about sparrows carrying coconuts to England, or the killer rabbit, or the serenade to Sir Robin?  The humor ranges from satire to potty jokes, from dark humor to downright silliness.  As with all Monty Python movies, the scenes hang loosely together, and some seem included merely because the writers came up with a joke over a few pints and couldn't bear to exclude it.
The film epitomizes Monty Python and the craziness of the British comedy group popular during the 1970's.  If you saw this years ago, you'll be surprised how funny it still is.  And if you've NEVER seen it, you should treat yourself, especially since lines from it continue to crop up in ordinary conversation.",1047513600,2,962,4.696428571428571
25915,5,0767824571,"Let me tell you this: the first time I watched this film, I don't think I laughed at it once. It seemed distant to me, a strange film that was sort of comical-looking, but it just plain didn't click with me. A few days later, I told someone I'd seen it, and then, for some reason, in description of it, it became utterly hilarious. And that's the way Monty Python seems to work. If you're not already initiated to the Monty Python style of humor, just go talk to someone who loves it, and suddenly you'll find yourself laughing like you've never laughed before. It's like the film just may be so brilliant that you need a little help to get you to realize that there's a joke, even with it glaring you directly in the eyes. The Python troupe, on top of that, plays it like they're in a period piece for most of the time -- throughout the film I don't believe a single one of them cracks more than the smallest smile. Of course, when I saw the film again, I was in stitches, and I am forever a Python fan. And while one of the most brilliant jokes I've ever seen doesn't appear in this film (it's in Monty Python's Meaning of Life, and it involved an animated leaf), there's definitely more than enough gut-busting Pythonesque madness here to sate your laughter or you might want to check for a pulse -- you may think you're going for a walk, but you're not fooling anyone.",1046476800,,1372,4.301158301158301

If you have, and delight in the antics of the Pythons, you will not be disappointed. It's a wonderfully restored, remastered, re-whatevered DVD. I loved to hear the actors and directors still genuinely laughing -- after all these years -- on the commentary tracks. This movie stands the test of time as a comedic masterpiece.

Whether you are a fan of the series or not, you will find this film one of the funniest movies you'll ever see, and it is an essential comedy to anyone and everyone.  The DVD features are more than worth noting as well; the double disc DVD features a laugh out loud commentary by Gilliam and Jones along with Cleese, Idle, and Palin, three karaoke-esque sing alongs, Gilliam's original artwork, fantasticly designed interactive menus based on Gilliam's art, and tons more.

Few films have been as brilliantly written as this and the troupe's ""Life of Brian"".  Actually, no films.  (That's a Monty Python reference right there).  It's not everyone's cup of tea; religion is put in its place, and there is bloodshed and sexual material present.
The extras are very nice, especially the BBC ""Film Night"" footage and a new segment with Palin and Jones revisiting the castle site on which the movie was filmed.  The extra audio track with Cleese, Palin, and Idle is amusing and interesting, definitely something that fans will want to hear.

I can't tell you how many times lines from this flick have served the purpose of livening up or changing the dull atmosphere of a party; and for those who know what I'm talking about, part of the fun is suffering through the mostly dreadful attempts at doing a British accent.

25922,4,0767824571,"I know many other reviewers have brought this up, but on a SONY DVD player, during certain scenes, rabbits and subtitles pop up unintentionally. There is a rabbit feature: when a rabbit comes up, you click on it, and it tells you production secrets (it is called ""the killer rabbit""). This is great if you like that, but if you're not interested in it, there's no real way around it. Every thirty seconds, you have rabbits popping up, even when you turn them off. This DVD is actually cheaper than the one-disc bare bones edition, yet people have spent more money to get that just so they don't have to deal with these stupid rabbits.

The frustrating thing is, this DVD wasn't just slapped together. The picture looks crystal clear compared to old copies on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD. The high definition widescreen presentation looks amazing; it's by far the best I've seen this film look. The soundtrack has a very loud 5.1 that is very cool, especially if you've always heard the film in mono. (If you prefer mono, it's there, too.)

There are two commentary tracks, with 4 of the actors on one and the 2 directors on the other. I know that the one with the 2 directors is taken from the Criterion Laserdisc, which is neither good not bad. The scene selection is okay, and the extra 24 seconds are unnecessary. Disc two has sing alongs, documentaries of the Holy Grail locations today, ""How to use your Coconuts"" (which is hilarious), ""MPHG in Japanese"" (which is okay), ""A load of rubbish"" (which is bad), ""On location with the Pythons"" (An 18-minute documentary made in 1974 by BBC), Terry Gilliam's original sketches, and a bunch of other stuff.

This movie is SO funny all the way through; characters such as the French Taunter, Knights of Ni, the ""undefeatable"" Black Knight, and Brave Sir Robin offer rich satires of the Legends, and episodes such as the witch trial and the tirades of the peasants also offer hilarious and clever looks at the reality of medieval times.

Monty Python's Flying Circus, which aired on British television from 1969-1973, is an original, funny, TV experience. The latitude that the group was given in terms of creativity is amazing. However, if one digs deeper, he/she learns that sometimes the BBC put the kibosh on some of the gags. In short, the Flying Circus shows were a testimony to the comic brilliance of John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, and my personal favorite, the now deceased Graham Chapman.  The other Python films are all great as well, including The Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life. But in the end, I think we all keep coming back to this film as the first and funniest of the Python movies.
I'll not try to navigate through the ""plot"" as it would be futile.  Instead, I'd like to show what an excellent DVD this is. Not only do we have the film in widescreen (that's a must---don't even try to get me to watch a film in ""pan and scan""!) but there's also some great extras including a 45 minute documentary where Michael Palin and Terry Jones revisit the old locations in Scotland where the film was shot. Who knew that the vast majority of the movie was shot in one old castle built in the early 14th century? Not me. There's also a neat little 17 minute BBC production called ""Film Night"" that shows on location interviews with all of the Pythons.  You can also sing-along to all of the musical numbers and there's a Lego version of the ""Nights of Camelot"" sequence (It is a silly place).
There are a lot of other extras that I'll let you find out about for yourself. Above all, this is the kind of DVD that serious film fanatics and collectors drool over. One that has a great movie in widescreen and a lot of great extras.",1039046400,4,1989,4.4141689373297

Well excuse us for not having a typical, American sense of humor - a movie doesn't have to have raunchy penis jokes or ridiculous one-liner 'punches' to be humorous! Granted, the movie does exihibit plenty of idiocy in itself, it is a different kind of idiocy. The Pythons' lunatic-like randomisity is what endears the fans.
This kind of humor is what my mom calls ""dry humor"". Well it is, for those of you out there who are too lazy to THINK. Comedy requiring thought - what a CONCEPT, huh?
Adam Sandler, Eddie Murphy, and all those others - mere cannon fodder to the Pythons! I'm not saying they aren't funny, mind you! I think Eddie Murphy is definitely hilarious! And Adam Sandler is..... .... well, his supporting cast does a better job than he does. If it wasn't for them, he wouldn't be quite as funny in movies (his CDs are a great though!).
My point is that they can't match up to the Pythons' thought patterns. They made comedy by touching nerves - sensitive areas that you find appalling at first, then somehow, you find them funny. Remember Life of Brian and Meaning of Life? Those were railed upon by being insensitive and overly nasty to the christian community. That's the humor in it! They make fun of true-to-life events!

This movie hilariously lampoons one of those legendary stories that all countries have and most people believe to be true.  They show the rediculous nature of royalty, and I certainly never perceived the peasants he encountered as communists. (Nor do they make themselves out to be that way).  Here are these people, working their land, and all of a sudden the ""King"" comes along.  They want to know who made him King?  Why, the lady of the lake, of course.  They're supposed to believe he has some devine power given to him by some aquatic tart?  That scene is clearly about how people will get along fine if just left alone, we don't need any self or otherwise appointed regents to come along and save us from ourselves.  I seriously doubt the human race survived over a million years without such dictators by accident.  The movie shows the lengths that people will go to get people to believe things that simply aren't true.  Hence, the scene about the ""witch"".  I love the holy hand grenade scene, where the priest figure reads of a sacred book with bible-like prose with instructions on how to detonate the holy hand grenade.  Is this not a perfect metaphor for how religious zealoutry often breeds violence and, look at Palestine, explosions?  Keep your percept-o-meter on high with this movie, because it's not just hilarious, it's perfect dogmatic satire.

One of the funniest aspects of this movie is the dialogue.  Some of the scenes are incredibly funny.  The burning of the witch (she turned me into a newt!) and Dennis the peasant (you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just cause some watery taut threw a sword at you!) are among the most memorable.  Equally funny is Arthur's battle with the black knight and Sir Robyn's encounter with the giant (when danger reared it's ugly head, he boldly turned his tail and fled).

Between ""Naughty, evil, wicked Zut!"", the taunting of Sir Robin by one of his own minstrels, the Black Knight that refuses to give up even after Arthur chops off all of his extremities and various other sight and word gags too numerous to mention, anybody with a good sense of the absurd will love this movie! It's a classic and deservedly so, joined in general quality by the uproarious ""Life Of Brian""! However, the Pythons couldn't keep it up beyond ""Life Of Brian', and you'll notice they pretty much broke up after the miserable ""Meaning Of Life"", only making cameos in Gilliam's movies afterwards.
Enjoy the first TRULY funny effort by the crazy Pythons!",1030147200,,827,4.52

What's not to like, right?  Boy, was I wrong.  The film just took a turn for the worse, when they tossed in the really horrible animation of God giving them the mission of finding the Holy Grail.  They also mixed the present (932 AD) with the future (1975 AD).  It didn't work for me.  The last 30 minutes just bored me.  I couldn't wait for it to just be over with.
I remember liking other Monty Python features more than this.  Disappointing.

You WILL sit through the entire end credits- and I mean ALL of them.  Watch it, you'll see (he he he he).
Ah, yes the special edition version.  Despite the fact that it is lacking Pink Frilly Edges (it's ok, I made them myself and taped them over the tv... yes I ACTUALLY did this), the features are well worth watching over again (unlike most documentaries that are good for only one viewing).  I especially liked the subtitles for people who don't like the film- hilarious!  Although if it is your first viewing I would recommend watching it without these subtitles, they might distract you.  The scenes that were translated into Japanese then re-translated back into English (as subtitles) are also wonderful!  Who could argue with the ""Great Sake Cup""?

The original trailers were brilliant and I had never viewed them before so it was great seeing them for the first time.
The movie itself looks great and should be standard issue for all mental hospitals or places where people are treated for depression.  Unstoppable giddiness is really the best way I can describe it.
There are some DVD's that you can be content to rent once or every so often.  The Holy Grail is a DVD that really must be owned.  No matter what awful events are happening in your life, this silly tale will certainly allow you to look on the bright side of life.

A lot of effort went into this special edition dvd, and it shows.  I particularly enjoyed seeing Jones and Palin visit locations.  They were in a jolly mood, their comments are interspersed with film footage, and they meet affectionate and funny fans along the way.

No, hear me out.
A scene can start off on a moment of abject, wonderful absurdidty. Then, in the blink of an eye, the nonsense is ignored. As the music swells, the heros enter an enchanted boat that bears them away to the castle... A-a-augh. Arthur kneels to thank the almighty Lord... and a sheep (or the skin of one, at least) is fired onto himself and his noble follower.
Behold, the gift of Python. Chapman in paticular has the gift to play the most absurd scene with utter conviction. Sometimes, it's good to play it silly, but someone should allways be playing it straight.
This can be seen frequently through out the movie: another example, outside the castle Anthrax (""Yes, it's not a very good name""), when Sir Galahad (Palin) beats against the door. ""Open the door!"" Or the opening. Or everything from the final taunt to the entrance of the police at the end, in one of cimema's great anti-climaxes.
In closing, few dissagree that the Holy Grail is, if not The Holy Grail of comedy, certainly one of the great comedic films. However, it would be interesting for some wily editor to splice together footage to create Monty Python and the Holy Grail-Epic.

25992,5,0767824571,"After their comedy series sadly left the airwaves, the Monty Pythons decided to venture into the realm of cinema. They only made four movies in total, but these four movies have gone on to be comedy classics. Hardcore Python fans might say that ""The Life of Brian"" was their best (albeit contraversial) film, but almost any casual Python fan or comedy fan in general will give ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" that title. How this film compares to the other Python films isn't that important, however, because ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is one of the funniest films ever made and a true comedy classic. And with the Special Edition DVD, we get full exposure to Monty Python's insane movie.
By now, the plot of ""Holy Grail"" is so well known that it can be quoted off the bat by almost anyone. King Arthur and his legendary Knights of the Round Table (Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad, Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Film, etc.) have been charged by God Himself to find the Holy Grail. To find it, they must overcome terrible dangers such as a three-headed knight, Frenchmen with outrageous accents, the dreaded Knights Who Say ""Ni!"", the virgin women of Castle Anthrax, and so forth.
It's not the plot of ""Holy Grail"" so much as it is the humor that makes this film a classic. To fully describe Monty Python's humor would do them a great injustice; it is so unique that it would be easy to spot one of their films a mile away amidst a sea of imitators. In ""Holy Grail"", this uniqueness works so well it's frightening. Plot elements flow smoothly from one to another (despite the fact each plot element is a separate ""skit"") and the movie as a whole is a cinematic masterpiece. Probably the only gripe I have with this film is the ending, which was a bit anti-climactic, but other than that ""Holy Grail"" is perfect in every way.
So, we have a great movie on our hands. What about the Special Edition? Let me just say that any fan of ""Holy Grail"" is missing out on the ultimate experience if they miss this DVD. This Special Edition is packed with extras, including but not limited to: an extra 24 (yes, 24!) seconds of film, a documentary on how the Pythons scouted movie locations, a scene from the movie done entirely in LEGO, an educational video on how to use coconuts, and so much more. There is so much stuff here that it'll keep the Python lover occupied for a long time coming. However, there is a slight glitch in the film that causes subtitles to appear sporadically in the film (I believe they're found in the places marked for the ""Follow the Killer Rabbit"" feature). While not life-threatening, it can get a little annoying.
Overall, ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail: Special Edition"" is worth any fan's time and money. It gives them a chance to own one of the funniest and greatest films ever made, while also offering some insane extras that aren't found anywhere else. Whether ""Holy Grail"" is the greatest Python film is debatable; whether it's worth owning isn't. Go get it! Now!",1019952000,3,2990,4.6116322701688555

No more murky VHS transfers where you can't see half the film.  On top of this it IS ""Monty Python & The Holy Grail"".  If you have not seen this film yet, see it.  YESTERDAY!
The bonus features add amusing little bits to the film.  One of the important points noted in the mini-documentary on sites, was the the whole film was budgeted for 150,000 Pounds-Sterling; in the end they went horrendously over budget and spent 200,000 Pounds.  Imagine making ANY film for that little money nowadays.  Then imagine making it as brilliant as this.
MP&THG parodies & taunts the Arthurian legends, Bergman films, police round-ups, historians, anarchists, monarchists, shrubbery, herrings, medieval food & clothing, musicals, and a few other vaguely related sujbects.  It is a film that is watchable multiple times (...I should know...); indeed you may HAVE to see it a second time just to catch all the jokes.  Then you'll have to watch it again to catch more jokes that you didn't even realize /were/ jokes the first couple times through.
The director(s) commentary (Terrys Jones & Gilliam) is good, but a little too much time is spent on ""the history of Monty Python"" for my tastes -- I would have liked a little more about the film and a little less about stuff that is available in a couple dozen books and tv interviews.  The other commentary track is also uneven, but with spots of true brilliance.  Imagine three Pythons deciding to pull the MST3K treatment on their own film and you get the idea.  The mini-features on scouting locations, on how to use a cocoanut, the sing-alongs, the Lego-vision (yes, as in Legos, those snap together bricks), and how-to-walk-like-a-monk-hitting-his-head-with-a-board are quite funny.
If you like this movie, get the DVD.  If you LOVE this movie, the the Special Editon DVD.

A spoof on the Kinghts of the Round Table and Camelot (and every other King Arthur story), THG begins to tickle you right off with the whole 'coconuts instead of horses' issue. This running gag is only a small bit of the film, but you remember it. The same goes for every off-center bit, from the powerful wizard named Tim to the logic by which one determines if a witch is made of wood. Thinking man's humour, this is.
But before I scare off you simpler types, let me add that I've watched this with my 12 year-old nephew and he thought it was hilarious. That's another thing; this film does not warrant an 'R' rating. Doesn't now and certainly didn't back then, which makes me wonder what sort of gits were sitting on the panel of the MPAA at the time (as opposed to the silly twits sitting on it now).

I wondered before I bought the DVD if in this fast food, fast paced, ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" times if it would still be as funny.
The duel with the Black Knight would stand up.... but what about the Killer Rabbit? The banquet scene a la songfest... ""Whot? THE CURTAINS?"" The French guard... ""Run away!"" ""Run away!"" ""Help! Help! I am being oppressed!"" Yes, no, not even the Killer Rabbit paled with age. Someone get me a tissue -- I laughed until I cried.
The DVD quality is astonishingly good for an (originally) low budget flick. You are offered the options of 5.1 Dolby, Dolby Digital or good old mono. Like everything Python, even the number of commentary and subtitle options are beyond the beyond. I particularly enjoyed the cast bitching. Excellent. Just excellent.
The bonus materials add an exorbitant amount of value. The Monks sing-a-long segment is extremely well done. I was able to figure out the difficult hand movements immediately. ""THWACK""
There is a lovely travelogue. Michael Palin and an old guy go wandering around some Scottish castles and glens. You get to see the inside of the castle on the island in the middle of the lake. ""Do they host B&B guests?"" was my only question.
Legos. The singing knights recreated in plastic animation. Near 'bout priceless.
But, even with all the extras: moaning and groaning, dancing Legos and at least, every bit of 10 minutes of additional animations -- not to mention the incredibly useful short about coconuts -- I think it is worth buying just for the film. Just to have it in your possession. So at anytime, you are a mere flick of the remote away from ""Ni!! Ni!!""

Whether the change of heart is due to improved understanding of the text or to the pressures of popular canonization, this Holy Grail has proven one of the most commonly shared quests of followers separated by as much as 3 generations.  Film teachers are often disappointed to discover that young viewers no longer respond with interest let alone animation to Chaplin and Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers and W. C. Fields.  The reasons are often attributed to the desensiticizing effects of fast-food modern culture, or to the postmodern amnesia that insures satire can not possibly work with an audience unfamiliar with the original objects of satire.  All interesting, if not compelling, theories--until you come to this film.  For a singular 90 minutes, the generations unite, erasing the boundaries of high and low culture, the informed and the uninformed, the old and the young.  There aren't many such grails left.

The documentaries aren't done in the style you might expect, but instead feature things like cast members walking about meadows, pointing, and reminiscing about ""that happened there"" and ""Graham couldn't remember this here"" and such. Very enlightening, but a tad long. For a better Python doc, check out ""Life of Python"" on DVD.
Other features include a very funny animated LEGO short, sing-alongs, and my personal favorite: The subtitles and audio tracks. There is a special section of the film you can watch dubbed in Japanese then re-translated into English for subtitles. There are subtitles from Henry IV Pt II for people who don't enjoy the film. There is a shouting track for the hearing impaired. Then, there are commentary tracks where you can hear some Pythons passive-aggressively ""discussing"" differences during the filming. A great film, a great DVD.",1015372800,,1019,5.144578313253012

This dvd set is crammed to the gills with bonus goodies, but the core material of the dvd, that is, the movie, is itself excellently tranferred and done with obvious care and concern.

26021,5,0767824571,"M.P. & The Holy Grail is a very inventive low-budget comedy, shot on location in Scotland.  To compensate for a lack of horses and/or equestrian ability, the knights skip and hop along to a backbeat of clapping coconut shells.  In their search for the Grail they encounter strange & terrible creatures, odd Frenchmen ensconced in Scottish castles, some pretty girls, British ""bobbies,"" an avaricious landowner, several knights of obscure purposes and a warlock named Tim.
The film is a series of isolated ""sketches"" loosely strung together with animated sequences or simple captions.  As is true for many great comedies, there is no proper ending to this film, dramatically speaking.  The Life of Brian is a step forward for Monty Python in that respect.  But Holy Grail has some of the most ridiculously funny hair-splitting logic serving as ""dialogue,"" and its slightly daft intellectual atmosphere is  unique even among Python's other works.
My DVD does not flash English subtitles after I've switched them off, but let the buyer beware; maybe some initial pressings were defective.

The cast from Monty Python made it their goal to create a movie that is silly as hell, and yet will have you struggling to keep your tears from laughing so hard.
King Arthur (Graham Chapman) and his trust servant Patsy (Terry Gilliam) travel through medieval England. On their way there, they encounter some of the strangest people you'll have ever seen (Including, but not limited to 'The Knights Who Say NI', an invincible Black Knight, a Constitutional Peasant, and a king who was determined to build a castle in a swamp).
While they travel and gather companions to join them in the court of Camelot, they are given a mission by God himself. Arthur must set out and find the Holy Grail.
In itself an easy enough task, but as his knights scatter across the country, they each become entangled in various perils (Imagine Sir Galahad the Pure being trapped in a castle of virgins who are dying to be spanked).
The end is sort of an anti-climax, but the legendary individual scenes more than make up for it. From it come numerous hilarious quotes that are frequently used by fans worldwide.
All in all, a movie that you HAVE to have seen, even if it was just to know how to react when someone tells you to go cut down the mightiest tree in the forest with a herring.
The extras on the DVD are probably worth it just to the fans of the flick, but I have yet to meet a person who saw the movie and didn't like it.

In terms of production value, it probably is, but it's not nearly as funny as ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail.""  Made on a shoestring budget and played absolutely straight by the troupe, it is hilarious and intellegent at the same time, as well as being charmingly rustic (due to the low budget).
The late Graham Chapman plays Arthur, and is perfect in the role.  He is always dignified and noble, even while taking insults from ludicrously-accented Frenchmen.  All the other Pythons have multiple speaking parts - a special highlight for me is Terry Jones as the whining prince.  The Pythons are at their pseudo-intellectual best in this, their first feature film.  My favourite part is Arthur's argument with the peasants making up the anarcho-syndicalist commune (""You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!""), followed closely by the opening scene of the film, where it's revealed that Arthur is not riding a horse but has a servant following him making horse-noises with a coconut (""Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?"").
The DVD is packed with nifty extras.  There are two making-of features, one made while the film was in production (by the BBC) the other made just recently.  The latter features Terry Jones and Michael Palin travelling through the country reminiscing and visiting the old locations (don't worry - it's better than it sounds!).  Most importantly, the DVD looks fantastic, and the sound is good as well, and if you're still trying to figure out what the characters are saying, you have several subtitle-caption options.  There are numerous other extras, including a version of the song ""Knights of the Round Table"" with animated Lego figures - hilarious!

 I'm not even gonna start with praising the movie. I wouldn't be writing this review if I didn't consider this one of the funniest films ever made. Fact of the matter is if you haven't heard of Monty Python (You poor idiot) this is the best film to start you off with. The humor is manic, intelligent, and incredibly unorthodox. Never in your life will you ever encounter anyone or anything else with this brand of humor. This is what you get when you combine five british comedic geniuses and one american animator with some whacked out visions. You get this comedy masterpiece. Also fact of the matter when it comes to a comedy of this caliber, accept no less than the best when DVD's are involved. This DVD has everything even little Lego figures singing and dancing.

My favorite ""extra"" is the documentary of Terry Jones and Michael Palin, revisiting all the sites where the movie was filmed (just 1 castle for many; an old copper mine; the Castle Aaarrrgg which they never got to enter during the shooting).
As for technical difficulties, I occasionally had problems with the ""white rabbit"" locking the playback, but that was all. Everything else worked as advertised.

If one doubts this, just go up to practically anyone and say ""I am Arthur, King of the Britons"" and I'll bet you 9 out of 10 will reply in falsetto female voice ""I didn't know we had a king!""

This special edition delivers a great deal of additional fun as well, including a facinating tour of Holy Grail shooting locations from Michael Palin and Terry Jones, and the entire script can be superimposed as you watch(yeah, like we all don't know the lines already) Bottom line:  GET THIS DVD, and BRING ME SOME SHRUBBERIES!!!!!!  Or else...(you know!)",1007942400,,920,4.6770186335403725
26073,4,0767824571,"Although I rather enjoyed the all-around silliness and just plain weirdness of the MPFC telly show, it never delivered the laughs like the troupes' first original cinematic outing did. Oh sure, I got a chortle or two from the 'Funniest Joke In The World' sketch, and especially the 'Cannibal Undertaker' bit, but for some real gut-busting moments, no previous or subsequent Python venture ever hit the mark as well as their quest for the Holy Grail. Knowing that Graham Chapman was on the sauce the whole time whilst shooting the movie made things even more entertaining!
Then there's that one great thing about having this flick on disc: I no longer have to hang out at the local midnight cult-matinee bijou! Nevermore must I stoically suffer the Python uber-geeks' annoying verbatim reciting of entire scenes from the flick and/or TV eppies, complete with really bad attempts at Cockney brogues and worse comic timing. Please, take a hint and leave British sketch comedy to the professionals, all right? Sheesh- and just when I thought Trekkies trying to imitate the halting speech patterns of Captain Kirk set the benchmark for obnoxious geek fandom! But, at least the Pythonphiles don't throw Spam or voles at the screen, like those black-leather-teddy-&-bustier-clad (and the women are dressed strangely as well!) 'Rocky Horror' freakos do with their toast & hot dogs. Great, there's people starvin' in some third-world country somewhere, and these retro-goth wanna-bes are flingin' the heat-crisped bread & processed meat links around like they're freakin' frisbees or something!
But I digress. Sadly, when it came to this movie's initial distribution on DVD (A.K.A. the UN-special edition), I was caught up in the notion that it would be the only version to be put out on the digital video market. I never anticipated the Pythons throwing out a special-edition pressing, which is eventually what happened as you can plainly see. But, looking back, I really should've seen it coming. After all, 'Life Of Brian', considered the best of the MPFC flicks by most (myself excluded), went the same route- given the Criterion Collection treatment, no less! Trailers, commentary tracks, the works! Great- now I gotta shell out several more bucks to make my Python DVD collection REALLY complete! Fortunately, I managed to sell my old 'MP&HG' platter on eBay for just a little less than what I originally paid for it; that helped things out quite a bit.
But, enough of my tangential prattling; time for my review of the features & extras! This baby's broken down into your basic 2-disc special edition format. Disc 1 is the movie itself, along with not one, but two commentary tracks by our beloved chaps. The first one features co-directors Gilliam & Jones. Although he's from the U.S., it's fairly apparent that Gilliam's stay in the British Isles has affected his vocabulary & accent a bit. During his discussion about the people going to theatres to see MP&HG, he referred to the lines of moviegoers as a queue (I think that's how it's spelled... it's pronounced 'cue') of moviegoers. Both he and Jones discuss the highs & lows of producing & filming the movie, including the revelation that much of MP&HG was financed by members of Pink Floyd, the Beatles, and other British pop/rock groups. Then there's the other three surviving Pythons droning on and basically wigging out on the secondary commentary track.
Then there's disc 2, which features just about every imaginable extra you can... um... imagine. There's the 45-minute retrospective documentary where Jones & Palin revisit the various locations that were used to film the flick. Much of it was shot at one particular Scottish castle; the rest of it around various parts of the Scottish countryside. One of my fave extras are the sample segments dubbed in Japanese, with their English translations in subtitles. Now you can see King Arthur & Co. begin their quest for the holy sake cup, and complete the Knights Who Say 'Ni!'s demand to find them a bonsai! Hmm... methinks something got lost in the translation...
There's also pics of various promotional posters, bills, and the like. Then there's the two theatrical trailers that are, sadly, pretty much the same... 'cept different. Also included are bunches of other things- singalongs, behind-the-scenes photos, Gilliam's concept sketches, and much more that I can't really list in too much detail 'cuz I'd go over my 1000-word allotment for this review if I did! Of course, if I removed my previous rant concerning Rocky Horror fans, that'd likely free up enough word space to continue my recap of this DVD's extras. I mean, it was rather mean-spirited, wasn't it? Then of course there were my snide remarks about naive Ebay bidders. So maybe I should-- naaahhh...
The whole deal even includes a semi-rigid mylar slipcover for the snap case! Unfortunately, the mylar apparently isn't very durable- I had to exchange this set twice because the slipcover got cracked in transit both times! It made for a frustrating demonstration of the hazards of purchasing things online. Fortunately, in this case the third time was indeed the charm. The slipcover also has a lenticular finish- you know, like those trading cards where there's two separate pictures on the same card. You look at it from one angle, there's one image. Then when you turn it a bit, another picture appears. Except in this case, there's no different images; it's just put on there to make the slipcover shiny & stuff. What a gyp!

26085,5,0767824571,"In the early 1970's the Monty Python troop (Michael Palin, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, and Terry Jones) stars from the immensely popular television series Monty Python's Flying Circus began producing, with the help of a fundraising concert headlined by Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd (You lie!! No, I didn't!), initial photography on what would later become (from all my extensive years of movie watching) the single most unforgivably sidesplitting, enormously irreverent, shrewdly perceptive, unremittingly uproariously aggressive, gruesomely hysterical, and endlessly quotable comedies EVER. Not even Mel Brooks's Best Efforts (The Producers, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein) comes very close to the revolutionary medieval merriment sustained in this royal purebred of cult classics. BAR NONE. No contest here.

Endlessly stockpiled with hauntingly hysterical sketches that will probably never leave your mind (no matter how hard you try) including, The Knights Who Say Nei, The Self-Abusing Monks (Eah aay ess eay dom eay nay), The Black Knight, The Trojan Rabbit, the Ever-Appearing Verbally Abusing French (I don't want to talk to you no more!!!), The Enchanter Named Tim, The Killer Bunny, The Bridge of Death (What is the capital of Hysteria?), The Old Woman Named Dennis, and so many countless more great sketches to include here that I'd die trying. Monty and Python and the Holy Grail remains an ever-enriching mirthful cult-classic that just seems to improve with age. Since Columbia has a bountifully hefty new special edition of the Holy Grail out now there should be no excuse, if you've never seen it (I think I'll go for a walk!!), just drop everything your doing (including Bringing Out Your Dead) and go experience this life changing movie today. You won't be disappointed, just tell them the Knight Not Appearing In This Film sent you, and they'll know what to do.
As for the options on the special edition here's a run-down:
Disc One: -""21st Anniversary"" cut of the film running an extra 24 seconds;  -Anamorphic Widescreen; -Dolby 5.1 track; -Original Mono Track; -Audio commentary with Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin; -subtitles ""for people who don't like the film"" (you get the text from Shakespeare's Henry IV instead); -an ""on-screen screenplay"" feature which lets you read the screenplay as you watch the film; -""Follow the Killer Rabbit"" feature;
Disc Two: ""Three Mindless Sing-Alongs""; -""The Quest for the Holy Grail  Locations"" featurette; -""How to Use Your Coconuts"" educational film; -""Monty Python and the Holy Grail in Japanese"" (with English subtitles); -the BBC Film Night special ""On Location with the Pythons; -an interactive cast directory; -still galleries with Terry Gilliam's original sketches and behind-the-scenes photos; -""A Load Of Rubbish"" with mystery items; -unused ideas and other material; -two trailers
and web-links.

Certainly among the funniest of all films, this bawdy, unhinged, send-up of a classic British myth (and spiritual metaphor for human redemption) takes no prisoners in its quest for laughs at any cost. Well, not really any cost because it was filmed on a ridiculously modest budget.

Under the direction of Pythons Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, and written and performed by the entire ex Oxford troupe -- Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Michael Palin -- the boys deliver their unique brand of haute silliness wearing armor and pretending to ride horses as they scamper across the timeless English countryside locations.

This is the second DVD release of ""Holy Grail"" and it's fully loaded. Not only does it have 24 seconds (yes, 24 seconds) of additional footage, it features a terrific audio commentary by surviving Pythons Gilliam, Jones, Cleese, Idle and Palin. The two disc set features wiggy sidebars that include intelligent and fitting subtitles taken from Shakespeare's Henry IV part II (for those who don't like the Python's dialogue), three mindless sing-alongs, a documentary by Palin and Jones: ""The Search for the Holy Grail Locations,"" tons of Terry Gilliuam's wonderful sketches, and ""a load of rubbish -- a surprise package of mystery items specially included for the mentally challenged."" And much more in the same vein.

These days, it seems laughs are harder to come by, and this 26 year old 89 minutes of inspired lunacy is a must have. Like the protesting plague victim says as he's carted off, ""I'm not dead yet.""

26122,5,0767824571,"I believe Monty Python had an impact on comedy that was so all-pervasive, it staggers the mind to consider the magnitude of it. This movie, their first, became a classic and my all-time favorite comedy the very first time I saw it. I left the theater thinking to myself, ""That flick will never be surpassed in its own genre of comedy."" And, I was right.
I have probably watched this film at least 45 - 50 times, and yet, I still catch something new everytime. Some new funny line that I never picked up before.
I know a review should give some hint as to what the plot is all about, so I will tell you this: The plot borrows a little from the ancient story of King Arthur. Arthur and his men are given instructions by God to find the Holy Grail. They must overcome many harrowing experiences to achieve this goal. For instance, they have to appease the dreaded ""Knights Who Say Nee!"" (Hint: Just don't use the word, ""it"" in front of them!) Arthur is forced to fight the Black Knight - this scene is very bloody -- not for children. Then, there is the bridge of death. ""He who wishes to pass this bridge must answer me these questions three,"" says the bridge-keeper, a very scary individual, indeed.
Arthur and his men prove themselves to be very courageous - well, except for Robin.
I won't tell you if they achieve their goal, but I will say the ending is quite a twist in the plot.",1004659200,,1383,4.343629343629344

Peasant: What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior.

26129,4,0767824571,"I'm not going to belabour the film itself - read the other reviews to find out more about how funny the film is. I will say that the picture quality of this version is far above any previous print of the film I've ever seen. If you've only seen the film on a worn-out VHS copy from the rental store, you'll be in for a treat. The colors are much sharper, and the details jump out at you. I had seen the film almost 100 times and had never been able to read the signs at the beginning of the ""Sir Robin"" sequence. There still are some film artifacts, but I would expect that from a film as old and cheaply made as this one. I think the job they did restoring the film is very well done.
The new mix of the sound is a bit artificial sounding. The music was remixed in stereo, and in certain places, the dialogue has a bit of stereo separation. The narration was completely redone in places, though, and that distracted me. I'm guessing they couldn't find the original narrative track, and with the new music mix, they had to redo it. On the plus side, the overall dialogue is sharper, and I was able to make out certain jokes that I had trouble understanding before. The good news is that they included the original mono soundtrack as well, so try the new mix, and if you don't like it, go back to the original.
I can't say enough about the extras. The menus are worth the cost of the DVD alone. Some of the extras are from the Criterion laserdisc, such as the ""Scenes in Japanese with translated subtitles"" section, but there is also a brand new skit from the film ministry on the proper use of Coconuts! I have yet to find any mind-bending easter eggs, but I'm sure they are there.

First off it contains the king of all comedy sequences, the almighty ""Black Knight"" sequence. We also get to learn about King Arthur's crusade, how to tell if someone is a witch, to beware of ""killer rabbit's"", how to deal with knights who say Nee, how to correctly answer questions to get across the bridge of peril, and how to get arrested while storming a castle. Not only funny, but essential for human survival. The extra stuff is most excellent. Michael Palin and Terry Jones go to the film sites and buy their own script at one castle and revisit the bridge of peril. We even get Lego Knights, and its a funny as it sounds.

26142,5,0767824571,"From the moment you see King Arthur (Graham Chapman) and his trusty aide Patsy (Terry Gilliam) ride out of the fog at the beginning of Holy Grail (I won't spoil the joke, it's one of the best), you know it's going to be on of those films. By ""those"", of course, i mean films that are consistently funny throughout. And Grail is one of the most startingly original comedies of all time. It's hard to imagine that it was produced by a comedy group that merely a year before had put together a woefully unfunny final series of Monty Python's Flying Circus.
 What makes Holy Grail so deliriously funny is the absolute anarchy of it all, the wide range of jokes, running and self contained. It has off the wall moments of nonsense that surely must have been dreamt up by the clinically insane. The Knights who say ""Ni"", the killer rabbit, the bridge of death, none have lost their power to split the sides of the viewer. Best are John Cleese's Black Knight and Michael Palin's repressed peasant: ""Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help! Help! I'm being repressed!""
 Yes, it's extremely silly. But what makes Grail, and the later Monty Python's Life of Brian, stand the test of time more so than the TV series and the film Monty Python's Meaning of Life is that the jokes are so accessible. They are not obscure or pretentious, they are just plain funny.
 What stops this from being a master piece is an all over the place narrative and a very, very disappointing ending, but these are small quibbles. The storyline may be flimsy, but the jokes that are hung on it are of a high calibre. The closest you can come to pure, unadulterated comedy.",1003190400,,1653,4.521739130434782

It takes a story that virtually everyone knows at least something about, mixes in physical humor with intellectual humor, and ends up making you laugh while making fun of just about everything that most people would normally consider sarcosanct (namely, religion and history).
This movie is stupid, yes, but it is stupid in such a brilliantly written way that it will leave you laughing for hours after you've finished watching it.  It pokes fun at everything, with religion and history at its heart.  Many of the themes in fact are loosely veiled so as to make fun of our modern problems in a very indirect way so that you don't even realize what you were laughing at until hours or days later after some introspection.  The physical slapstick and the indirect satire (such as the scene of the Holy Hand Grenade - a classic that pokes fun at religion while seeming to embrace it) are melded perfectly in a way that only Monty Python can do it.
The Special Edition is a vast improvement over the previous version, giving us a new anamorphic widescreen transfer, better sound, and some special features to boot.

26176,5,0767824571,"The grand opus of Monty Python, a goofy gang of guys who invented the most skewed comedy routines in the world. Rather than a series of individual spoofs, this movie is a long spoof based on Arthurian legend; specifically, the legend of the Holy Grail. Somehow, these six guys not only produced a low-budget movie, but cast themselves in multiple (many multiple) roles throughout it and still maintained a hilarious result!
Rather than a real story, this is a series of vignettes concerning the long-suffering King Arthur and his loyal knights of the Round Table (""We eat ham and jam and Spam-a-lot!"") Among them are:
*The encounter with the Communist peasants in their autonamous collective (""HELP! HELP! I'M BEING REPRESSED!"")
*The Tale of Sir Robin, the cowardly knight with a chicken on his shield.
*The king's encounter with the loony black knight, in which a ridiculous series of blood-spurtings will have you guffawing. (""You've got no arms left!"" ""Yes I have!"" ""LOOK!"" ""It's just a flesh wound."")
*Sir Lancelot receives a desperate note from a castle, but is the person sending it what he expects?
*The French attack.... verbally. (""Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries!"")
*Sir Galahad is waylaid in the temptation-laden Castle of the Maidens (interestingly enough, in traditional legends Sir Galahad did go to the Castle of the Maidens, though in very different circumstances *leer*)
*The Keepers of the Sacred Word, the Knights Who Say ""NI!""
*The rabbit of death, Tim the Enchanter, and so much more.
The sheer off-the-wallness is what sells this movie, and Monty Python was in rare form. Graham Chapman's primary role is King Arthur, who seems to be the most competant of the bunch but is still pretty goofy. John Cleese of ""Fish"" and ""Fawlty Towers"" fame stars as Sir Lancelot/Tim the Wizard/The Rude Frenchman, and is amazing in each role. Eric Idle plays lily-livered Sir Robin/Roger the Shrubber (don't ask)/Brother Maynard. Terry Gilliam is lower-key as Sir Gawain/Patsy; Terry Jones is also pretty low key as Sir Bedivere/Prince Herbert. Michael Palin has a hilarious series of roles including the King os Swamp Castle/Sir Galahad/Leader of the Knights Who Say Ni.
Shoring up the cast is Cleese's now-ex-wife Connie Booth as The Witch, John Young as the Historian/Dead Body, Neil Innes as the annoying Minstrel/Page Killed by Rabbit.
Perhaps the funniest move in this movie was mocking the budget limitations, with the coconut shells and so forth. The special effects are deliberately cheapened to make them sillier, such as the sprays of rather gloppy gore when someone is wounded. The script is typically hilarious, full of stupid comments and straight-faced jokes.
Frankly, it's hard to think of Camelot now without rhyming it with ""I have to push the PRAM-A-LOT"" and the line of tap-dancing knights. This movie is lodged in the American brain, and it ain't budging soon...
A small note: You may want to check out the Veggie Tales ep ""Josh and the Big Wall,"" in which a respectful (yet kooky!) homage is paid to this film!",995760000,54,3070,5.02156862745098

In other cases it's just the frame of mind I happen to be in, at this or that particular viewing.
The last time I saw it was when I borrowed the video from my sister, and I noticed a major plot element that I'd been missing all these years (I can tell you I was really embarrassed when I figured it out!).

26194,5,0767824571,"Monty Python took a hell of a chance making a full lenght motion picture, as the simple production and mostly strictly six man skits which characterized their TV show and their live performances since 1968 gave their brilliant scripts and acting their full power. With the Flying Circus behind them, however, and John Cleese already starting to work on his own project with his wife (Fawlty Towers), Monty Python decided to take that chance, and it proved to be worth it, mainly due to the fact that Monty Python and the Holy Grail looks more like a collection of skits than a single story; any attempt to follow the storyline will be quite disappointing. However, almost every scene is brilliant by itself, and the movie provides some of the most memorable moments and one-liners in comedy history.
The perfect timing and team work of the Monty Python crew, which made 'Flying Circus' one of the most popular shows in history, was transferred well to the big screen. Additional actors were kept to a minimum, so each of the Pythonists played several parts. As usual, the casting is wonderful, and each of the six actors brings life to all his characters, as each one gets one or two great scenes to show what he has to offer. Graham Chapman was given the role of the straight man (sort of like Zeppo Marx only funnier) and does a great job in the part of King Arthur, as well as an unforgettable short appearence as God (""Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy..."") Terry Gilliam is, as usual, not given a very big part in the movie, but does a great work on his very few lines as both Patsy, Arthur's trusty steed (""It's only a model."") and the keeper of the Bridge of Death, as well a short appearence as himself (The Animator). His animation sequences on this movie are his absolute best. Director Terry Jones does a wonderful Sir Bedevere, supplying the brilliant witch scene, as well as the unforgettable Prince Herbert. Michael Palin is a great Sir Galahad, but is more memorable as Dennis (""Help! Help! I'm being repressed!"") and of course the leader of the Knights Who Say Ni. Eric Idle is dreadfuly funny as usual as Sir Robin, and also as Roger the Srubber, Brother Maynard, the Dead Collector (""Bring out your dead!"") and Concorde. And most of all, John Cleese, making not only a wonderful Sir Launcelot, but also supply some of the film's most memorable moments as the newt guy, Tim the Wizard, the rude French soldier and of course the Black Knight (""It's just a flesh wound!"")
The comedic work of the Monty Python team, their scripts and their timing are flawless. Python's humor is one that works on familiarity and not on surprise, and so I still enjoy it after watching it about twenty times - it's the perfect kind of thing to own on video. Get the Holy Grail, as well as Life Of Brian, And Now For Something Completely Different, and Meaning Of Life. They  will become your most precious earthly posessions.",994291200,,2979,4.599624060150376
26195,5,0767824571,"I saw this for the first time when I was a high-school freshman, and I was hysterical throughout the entire ravenous, mauling rabbit scene.  I was giddy and guffawing through the rest of the movie due to dismembered, blood-spurting knights, the idiocy of Arthur himself, and the surly, obnoxious Frenchman.
Only when I was older was I able to fully appreciate the peasants pointlessly toiling in mud and spouting Marxist ideology, (much to Arthur's unappreciative chagrin) and the unexpected ""ending.""  When I first saw it, the ending actually made me angry and left me feeling cheated, but once I got used to it, I appreciated how inevitable it was considering the rest of the film....
This movie is completely hilarious, full of (violent) slapstick, satire, and loveable yet bumbling knights on a quest.  I heartily recommend it to anyone with decently developed sense of humor.",993859200,,880,5.055172413793104
26196,5,0767824571,"""The Holy Grail"" is easily the best of the three true movies released by the Pythons Monty.  Riding on the tail end of the Flying Circus, this of all the movies follows the same pattern as the hilarious sketch comedy series.  Unlike the semi-epic ""Life of Brian"" or the unquestionably abstract ""Meaning of Life,"" ""The Holy Grail"" uses the Flying Circus pattern of loosely connected sketches, only this time with a more apparent theme (the Arthurian legend, obviously).
Consequentially, most of the humor comes in disconnected packets on the order of about ten minutes each.  The beauty of this is that the movie can focus almost entirely on comedy, letting the insubstantial plot (certainly not the most prominent part of the film) sort itself out along the way.  From this unbridled font of humor comes all kinds of side-splitting antics on the part of the Python crew, from the hilariously satirical (How to tell a witch), to the hilariously irreverent (the Holy Hand Grenade), to the hilariously pointless (the Knights who say ""Ni!""), to the hilariously hilarious (French taunts and livestock, undoubtably one of the most hilarious works of comedy ever recorded on film).
This is some of Pyton's best stuff; you'll have a heck of a time finding anything better by this group (but a good time nonetheless).  If you're looking for some of the same sketchy humor, don't bother with the other two movies.  Go for Python's non-movie theatrical feature, ""Live at the Hollywood Bowl,"" the Flying Circus series, or the innumerable Monty Python CDs.  Short of a few Flying Circus gems, though, it doesn't get any better than this.",992822400,3,1624,4.948529411764706

It is absolutely one of the best comedies ever made.  Unfortunately, the original DVD release included no extras.  For people like me who care about such things, this was a major tragedy, especially since the DVD release of Life Of Brian was so good (more extras than you could ever want).  Now, finally Holy Grail is getting the same treatment.  Available as a two disc set, I definitely recommend it.  The extras are just great, plus you get a (very slightly) longer version of the film.

I like it over the ""The Life of Brian"" which I had to watch two or three times to get all the jokes. I think the reason is I used to read tales of King Arthur as a child but didn't know much about the bible or Jesus. As for the technical specs of the DVD I would give a three only because of the picture quality and sound isn't so good and has no special features which is common with DVD's now.

Anyway, it will always be in my top ten list of movies. I consider it Monty Python's ""Blazing Saddles"". I don't know why it Leonard Maltin considers it for hard core fans only. My Dad used to show his ninth grade Geography class this movie when they studied Europe. The kids understand most of the movie and they like it. (Though the average kid doesn't get all of it). And I became a fan of Monty Python from watching this one movie.
Just wanted to add that I got the Special Edition. It's Awesome! The Lego scene and the Japanese version is funny.

The movie opens with a hilarious conversation about coconuts between King Arthur and some guards on a castle rampart. From there, things get even sillier.
Another thing that makes this film fun to watch is the skillful animation of Terry Gilliam. The cartoon segment where King Arthur and his men encounter God is especially funny as is the scene where Arthur and his men run away from the dreaded black beast.
Essentially, THG is a compilation of funny skits that are loosely held together by a contrived plot. THG is one movie that will definitely keep you in stitches but it will also let you down as the ending is rather weak--to say the least!
Having seen this film several times over the past two decades, it seems to me that THG was more than the Python gang could handle. This film has an aura of impatience about it and it seems that the Python troupe were glad to get it done and over with.

Oh, really?  Sorry about that.  I thought we were talking about something else.
Anyways, the DVD of this Monty Python classic is rather bare as far as DVDs go -- it has subtitles, scene selection, and the trailer to the film.  (Oh, and it has the trailer for ""Dr. Strangelove,"" too!)  But alas, the Pythoners don't provide any behind-the-scenes information or commentary.  If you buy this DVD looking for extras, you may be disppointed.
Of course, if you buy the DVD for the *movie,* then that's a whole different ball o' wax altogether.
As you know, it's violation of the law to be on the Internet and not know anything about ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail.""

People don't say much about the disappointing ending to the film, but the rest of the movie more than makes up for it.
This was the first feature film for the Monty Python troupe, and they filmed it on a low budget ($750,000).  That's why the film stock is rather bland and the color is faded, compared to other films of the time...but again, no one really minds that.  This is still one of the great comedies of this time, or any time, and there are more full belly laughs in this film than you'll find in ten Hollywood comedies.

There are just too many funny scenes to describe, many of which have passed into legend along with such catchphrases as 'Run away!' and 'We are the knights who say....Ni!'
Basically, this movie jabs the Arthurian legend, heroic knight movies and movies in general in the eye with a sharp herring (sorry, reference to the film there). Bits where references are made to the film's construction are made are among the funniest moments, e.g.: ""'It's the old man from scene 24!'"" and 'Fortunately, at that moment the animator suffered a fatal heart attack.' Unlike the other Python film I've seen, The Meaning Of Life, pretty much every single sketch is howlingly funny.
Special mention must go to the point where the modern historian comments on the action, then gets summarily hacked down by a passing knight. The only problem with this scene is that it sets in motion a sort of plotline which results in the rather sudden and (to me) disappointing ending, which was funny, but I would have rather liked to see the main Quest plot carried to its conclusion.",980380800,2,1246,4.720183486238532

There are many memorable parts to this film, and it is still very popular today, with good reason. I often find myself recalling amusing parts from the film, such as the witch scene, the wedding scene, and the killer rabbit and the holy handgrenade, which is my favorite part. The film doesn't go overlong, it stays at a lively 90 minutes, and although it leaves you wanting more, it is not going to take a large chunk out of your day. This movie is not a star vehicle and does not use cursing tirades to achieve comedy. (I don't consider the latter true comedy.)

No movie is quoted nearly as often -- for crying out loud, it came out 25 years ago and people still recognize lines from it.  You will start laughing in the first minute or two, and will not stop laughing, or even slow down, for the entire duration of the film.  I have often wondered how these Monty Python guys ever came up with so much random hilariousness.
A couple things I just want to mention -- my theory is that the Monty Python guys set out to satirize not only the medieval world, but the nature of power, and it's relation to myth.  I took an amazing course once on this topic with Prof. Laurence DeLooze, and he pointed out a lot of intriguing things.  This movie can actually really get you thinking about what rationalizations underlie any powerful institutions, kingship or otherwise.  Or even what rationalizations we employ every day to justify our own behavior, Sir Lancelot's shenanigans at the wedding party being the case in point.  What if you didn't respond to some of the situations they portray with laughter, but with outrage?  Perhaps that is a better response.  Especially having read Eric Idle's remarkably sophisticated ideas about the nature of humor in a book he recently came out with, I'm inclined to suspect that these dudes had a few (good) ideas in mind, behind the laughter they've provoked for a quarter of a century.

Movies lose  some of their power over you when you have every line memorized (even the  Directors Cut).
