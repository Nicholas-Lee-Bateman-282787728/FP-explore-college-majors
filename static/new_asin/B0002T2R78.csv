THIS TOTAL PURE GARBAGE ITEM.

WELL THE DVD IS IN CHINESE AND NOT IN ENGLISH. OH WELL NOT RIGHT NOT AT ALL.",1363651200,,138,4.074074074074074
8031547,5,B0002T2R78,"This is a great box set with some super rare films included.

Some are not Shaolin films with monks though is my only complaint.

Invincible Iron Palm is a typical old school film that does feature Iron Palm from Shaolin but not a shaved head in sight.

On the other hand you get some real classics like Shaolin Strikes Back and a bonus disc with authentic Shaolin demos and even some San Da kickboxing which is very cool.

The best thing is the price which can't be beat.

Have a Shaolin week with this set! That's how long it took me to get through all the films!",1148256000,,565,4.242990654205608
8031548,5,B0002T2R78,"This value pack is a sure fire bet.

You get 10 films for a super low price of under 20 bucks so it's less than 2 dollars a movie!

Some of the films are quite decent while others are pretty good.

Can't really complain because of the price.

Definitely worth buying to get an `insatnt' collection.",1119398400,2,298,4.267857142857143
8031549,2,B0002T2R78,I was excited when i picked this set up. but when i got home tears began to roll. the dvd transfers suck!!!!!!!!!!like a vcr to dvd burner bootleg quality. grainy and the subtitles don't even fit on the screen so you have no idea whats going on. and if they do fit the screen the words are in pure white so they are IMPOSSIBLE to read next to the bright backgrounds. I gave it 2 stars for the 2 movies you could understand. BE VERY CAUTIOUS BUYING ANY OLD KUNG FU ON DVD MOST I HEAR ARE LIKE THIS!!! one film on here i saw before called shoalin strikes back looked and sounded better on vcr tape !!!!!!,1115856000,4,602,4.110169491525424
