5696902,4,B00C81AW8E,"Great choice of westerns, all above average. From great (Rio Conchos is easily the best, qualitywise and the HD image) to good (the other 3). Too few bonuses, though. I guess the low price must have a downside. This is the one. But it doesn't alter the excellent deal with this 4-movies Pack. Great way to re-discover some long time no see Westerns.",1383091200,,349,4.555555555555555

5696905,3,B00C81AW8E,"Bought for Rio Conchos in blue ray.  The only film that is not worth the time is Take A Hard Ride. IT STINKS! Rio Conchos is the standout, but the other two are worth a watch. The print is good for a standard blue ray transfer. Don't expect any restoration, but they are still better than the standard dvd.  C6",1381017600,5,310,4.15
5696906,5,B00C81AW8E,"These Blu-Ray versions are the best these films have looked.
Rio Conchos especially looks great in this Blu-Ray version.
Great musical score by Jerry Goldsmith, and a lot of action and
better than average dialogue from Richard Boone, Tony Franciosa,

5696907,5,B00C81AW8E,"So far the best western bargain on Blu-ray this year. I have bought RIO CONCHOS in every incarnation to date and never has it looked this good. It was worth the price alone. I would have bought THE LAST HARD MEN as a single as well. The other two titles are a delightful bonus. Having Jerry Goldsmith score 3 of the 4 titles is another plus. Now if Timeless media can empty the rest of the FOX unclaimed westerns such as FROM HELL TO TEXAS,100 RIFLES and STAGECOACH 1966 we could call it a clean slate.",1375660800,6,502,4.239583333333333
5696908,5,B00C81AW8E,"all add up to a 5 star recommendation!

I'm a huge James Coburn fan and I picked this up just for ""The Last Hard Men"" and it looks great! I figured for the price I was getting 3 free ""bonus"" films. Well the three other films are not all that bad, in fact Butch and Sundance the Early Years was far from the rip off of the great original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Butch-Cassidy-and-the-Sundance-Kid-Blu-ray/dp/B0014BQQYS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid [Blu-ray</a>] that I've always assumed and was enjoyable. I also enjoyed the 10 minute interview with Sundance himself , William Katt. On the other Disc I found a bit of buried treasure in Rio Conchos which featured some legendary actors and a nice 2:35 anamorphic picture!  The last movie ""Take A Hard Ride"" is for my money far lesser than the others but enjoyable in its own right and came along with two very very interesting bonus interviews with Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson and the late great Jim Kelly.

I'm not used to budget ""collections"" being treated so well... bonus interviews, Trailers, .... and pretty nice HD Transfers!
When you consider what Olive films is charging for a 70 minute Black and White John Wayne movie on BR these days... this is a fabulous value and delivers hours of BR fun for Western Fans.",1375401600,12,1354,5.117647058823529
5696909,5,B00C81AW8E,"I have been searching for years for a good copy of Rio Conchos. It's finally here. The Shout DVD was great but this Blu-Ray version is awesome. I don't have a reference quality system but I can't imagine this feature looking any better. The backgrounds jump out and reveal parts of the image that I had not seen before. I have not had the chance to view the other movies but if they are anywhere near the quality of RC then this purchase is even better at this price. Four BR's for under $20! If Shout and Timeless can keep this up, there will be a whole new customer base, based on popular but not necessarily financially successful titles. For a movie fan like myself, who in the '60's wondered how to get copies of my favorite films, this surge of different titles is a miracle. I wish I had more dollars to spend.",1375315200,10,817,4.311688311688312
5696910,5,B00C81AW8E,"Timeless Media Group did a pretty good job on transferring these four films to Blu-ray. There are two disks with two films on each. The special features included are film trailers and interviews by Fred Williamson, Jim Kelly and William Katt. All movies are in Widescreen format and a total runtime of 423mins. Here are the films included and my review of the quality of them.

""Rio Conchos"" (1964/2.35:1 Widescreen) 4/5
-Stuart Whitman, Richard Boone, Tony Franciosa, Wende Wagner, Jim Brown; Directed by Gordon Douglas
Overall the quality of this movie was quite good with sharp and clear picture. The audio sounds really good with ""dts-HD Master Audio 2.0"" and sounds great on a 5.1 system. At some points, during dark parts it doesn't look as sharp.
""Take a Hard Ride"" (1975/1.78:1 Widescreen) 3.5/5
-Lee Van Cleef, Jim Brown, Fred Williamson, Catherine Spaak, Jim Kelly, Barry Sullivan, Harry Carey Jr,; Directed by Anthony M. Dawson
Overall the quality is okay and at some points does have sharpness to the picture. The audio sounds pretty good with the same audio as the first film.
""Butch & Sundance: The Early Years"" (1979/1.78:1 Widescreen) 4/5
-William Katt, Tom Berenger, Brian Dennehy, Jill Eikenberry, Christopher Lloyd; Directed by Richard Lester
Overall the quality of this film is quite good with clear and sharp picture with pretty good color. The audio, same as the others is pretty good and doesn't have any crackles.
""The Last Hard Men"" (1979/2.35:1 Widescreen) 4.5/5
-James Coburn, Charlton Heston, Barbara Hershey, Jorge Rivero, Michael Parks, Larry Wilcox, Christopher Mitchum; Directed by Andrew V. McLaglen
The quality of this film, in my opinion is the best out of these four. The film has great color, sharpness and is really clear. The dark scenes look pretty good and is sharp. The audio sounds great and is the same as the other three.

Overall this is a great Blu-ray set for less than $20 and is a definitely must have. This is a great item to replace those DVD double-features by Shout.",1375056000,32,2020,4.95575221238938

5696917,4,B00C81AW8E,Getting the Blu-Ray treatment has certainly improved these films from their DVD issues which is to be expected.

8578540,5,B00C81AW8E,The blu ray transfer is really good for all of these movies. The movies themselves are mostly fine. Rio Conchos is good. Richard Boone is great in it. Take a Hard Ride is the worst of the bunch. Really boring despite a talented cast. Butch and Sundance is the best of the bunch. Williams and Berenger are great in it but are no Newman and Redford. The Last Hard Men isn't bad either. James Coburn steals the show from Charlton Heston.,1522368000,,434,4.37037037037037
8578541,5,B00C81AW8E,Good western. Very good picture and sound. Great price under 15 bucks.,1515024000,,70,4.916666666666667
8578542,5,B00C81AW8E,"This is one of the best deals out there for fans of westerns. I wasn't aware of most of these films and out of respect for the original, refused to watch ""Butch and Sundance- The Early Years"". 20th Fox must have stored the original prints well because the transfer is strikingly clear on all 4 films. I even enjoyed ""Butch"" etc. ; it being a kick to see a youngTom Beringer and even how Katt tried to channel a young Robert Redford, even resembling him in some scenes. Of course the script was ridiculous, William Goldman being part credited but only responsible for the characters he built in the original. Still, Richard Lester is a good director and working with what he had, made it work.
Hopefully it's not racist to say that for me ""Take a Hard Ride"" is the real loser in this grouping. I was unable to come to terms with 3 things in the movie. First, it was filmed in THE CANARY ISLANDS. Paradise took a left turn before it got to these locations. This is the ugliest terrain I've seen in a western since a Richard Boone picture with Leslie Caron as a nun filmed in the Israeli desert. Not that everything in the west is beautiful but
nothing I've seen in Texas/Oklahoma/Oregon/Washington/California/Wyoming/Utah/Idaho/Arizona/New Mexico and Missouri is as god awful ugly as the landscape in this picture. It looks like most of it was photographed in mounds of mine leavings.
My second problem was Fred Williamson. I've seen him in other films and he's a capable actor. Probably more than he was as a football player where he called himself ""The Hammer"" The Ham part is accurate. The first part of the film he sounds like he got his acting portrayal by watching Sammy Davis Junior play Sportin' Life in ""Porgy and Bess"". Jim Brown is good and Lee Van Cleef plays his usual slanty eyed self. Jim Kelly wisely doesn't have a speaking role and Dana Andrews, Barry Sullivan and Harry Carey Jr. took the small paycheck and a ticket to the Canary Islands where hopefully there was a beach and some actual plants growing.
The third thing was a little more disturbing especially since major stunt talents like Hal Needham and Buddy Joe Hooker were involved in the film. That was the treatment of the horses in some scenes. There were clearly some trip wires used and a few instances where it looked like some real damage was done before a cutaway. Not that either of these two were responsible for the horse gags. It is obvious when a horse has been trained to fall and when it comes as a complete suprise. There were a few suprises here.",1506384000,,2537,4.565789473684211
