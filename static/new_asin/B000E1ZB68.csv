8104482,5,B000E1ZB68,"This series surprised when I saw it the first time. The animation is very good for a TV-series. Elle looks different yet similar enough to her counterpart in the OAV series. Some of the fights are impressive and others are well done. It has a cool story with several twists in it that makes it very enjoyable to follow.

This anime is recommended to anyone who likes action and anime in general.",1169596800,2,395,4.486111111111111
