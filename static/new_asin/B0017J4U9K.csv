Beginning in the year 125 AD, an immortal by the name of Colin Macleod is on a mission; a mission that he has spent 2000 years trying to complete. His clan and lover were killed by another immortal by the name of Marcus Octavius. Swearing to avenge the fallen, Colin has pursued Marcus relentlessly for centuries. His chase has taken him through some of mankind's bloodiest conflicts in history. Now, Colin has tracked him to the year 2187, to a post apocalyptic New York City which Marcus now rules with a highly equipped militia. Colin has the odds heavily stacked against him, but is still hell-bent on finally getting his revenge. -summary

Highlander: The Search for Vengeance is another take on the long running Highlander franchise. I have to admit this was my very first exposure to the franchise, and up to this day I still haven't seen any of the films or TV series. I knew absolutely nothing about the story at all until I saw this anime feature, with that said, I really have no idea on what a fan of the series would be looking for; but I do have an idea on what an action oriented anime fan would be looking for, and I don't believe many of them will be too disappointed. Now for fans of the director, I recommend setting your standards a bit low here.

The film moves at a good pace and delivers some decent action scenes mainly involving sword play. Since this film was directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, those whom are familiar with his work should already know to expect some stylish and blood soaked battles. The man has proven to be a master of his trade. However, when compared to his earlier works such as Wicked City, Ninja Scroll, and Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust. He has clearly missed a few steps. The action scenes are clearly dumbed down and aren't very imaginative but they're still entertaining.

For the most part this is your typical revenge themed movie, fortunately the story and plot isn't too paper thin. The world has been ravaged by man's constant destructive nature, plus there's an airborne virus killing off the remaining population in New York City. The people whom refuse to serve Marcus have retreated underground in vain with hopes of avoiding the sickness. Now with Colin's help, they attempt to invade Marcus fortress to find a cure.

Unlike some of Kawajiri's works, Ninja Scroll & Wicked City in particular, the lead villain especially has some depth. There's a bit of background on some of the more important characters. The film also adds an interesting form of commentary. This is delivered through the personalities of Colin and Marcus, and it raises the question on who could be the worst of two evils. Could it be the mad demi-god, yet civilized Marcus vying for the perfect utopia? Or the near savage Colin, whom thirsts for revenge and can care less for anyone whom tries to befriend him? In any case, their centuries long feud provides a good amount of action and at times some laughs. The secondary characters serve small purposes, and surprisingly aren't present only for a lengthy body count. The main character, two secondary's, plus lead villain, also resemble characters from Kawajiri's past works. So, there's quite a bit of rehashing going on here.

The production values are rather high. The animation is pretty fluid from sword clashes to burning buildings. The detailed artwork consisting of dilapidated buildings, ruined bridges, and ran down streets, tells the story that the world is hell. My only gripe concerning the visuals is mainly with some of the character designs. Marcus and Colin especially, resemble Gemma from Ninja Scroll a bit too much. They almost appear to be brothers from other mothers. The soundtrack is also fitting and has an epic feel to it. The voice acting is pretty solid packed with some profanity.

I have several other gripes with the film. It almost appears that a new viewer to the franchise must have an idea on what's going on. It is explained what an immortal is and that they can only be killed permanently through beheading; but what isn't explained is what exactly is the ""Quickening"". From what I gathered, when an immortal is killed, the killer must have absorbed his powers or essence. The event is quite the spectacle consisting of a well animated light show. Another gripe I have is predictability. The characters actions were too easy to call a lot of the time, and another thing, mullets just aren't cool to me especially when they're on women.

Now is Highlander: The Search for Vengeance a great anime film or a masterpiece? Not at all from where I see it, but it is a fun ride. I enjoyed the concept of it enough to give the rest of the franchise a try one day. I recommend this mainly to action fans, fans of the director, and perhaps to fans of the franchise as well.

Pros: Crisp and clean artwork, nice animation, good battles, character background

Cons: Kawajiri's usual formula but watered down, somewhat predictable, one too many mullets",1427760000,,4985,4.752601156069364
