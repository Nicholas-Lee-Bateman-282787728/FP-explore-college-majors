3872885,4,B0028P4WH2,"I did this workout yesterday. Cardio 1 is very basic, kind of a warm up style...doesn't really get your heart pumping. There is no warm up section on this DVD so cardio 1 can be a warm up. Cardio 2 gets better by 7 minutes....gets your heart rate up a bit. I thought the leg workout was very good. Despite only 10 reps that she does for each exercise, my legs and behind are sore today. Arm segment is good too. Abs segment a bit boring.

She doesn't talk much, just to give you direction....quite music on the background....could be a bit boring cause of that. I also wish you could build a custom workout out of 10 min segments. But still its a pretty decent workout .....you could use it on your easier days if you've been working out awhile since it is kind of on a slower/ basic level.",1370649600,4,790,4.231788079470198
3872886,4,B0028P4WH2,This is a great video to start an excercise program with. It's low impact & easy moves to master. My only gripe would be that there's only 2 Cardio excercise segments out of six. I'd rathher there be three MINIMUM and skip the stretching. But an overall good video if you're not in tip top shape.,1360540800,2,296,4.303571428571429
3872887,5,B0028P4WH2,"Kathy Kaehler is one of the easiest instructors to follow, and her tapes yield results! I used her Claudia Schiffer Perfectly Fit collection after my son was born, and I have been hooked on her videos ever since. This is a must-have for anyone who needs to get in shape but has no time for gym memberships, no space for exercise equipment, and no desire for a ""bootcamp"" style workout regimen! Simple, Fast, and Gets Results! Very easy to stick to!",1359763200,6,448,4.54320987654321
3872888,5,B0028P4WH2,"This is without a doubt my favorite DVD workout.  I love the way Kathy focuses on form, teaching you the right way to do a move.  She makes it easy to follow, yet really works you out.  My favorites before this one were the Perfectly Fit series, but those are only available on VHS.  I noticed that Kathy was the trainer on those videos so went looking specifically for another done by her - and I am so glad I found this.",1337126400,8,422,4.109756097560975
3872889,5,B0028P4WH2,"This is my 3rd Kathy Kaehler Work-out dvd--and they just keep getting better and better.  The work-outs are straight forward, anyone can do them, and they work.  I've gotten stronger, improved my shape, and my energy has increased.  THANK YOU KATHY K. - You are the best!!!",1305590400,13,273,4.76595744680851
3872890,4,B0028P4WH2,"I have some older Kathy Kaehler videos that I love with 5 minute workouts.  This new video is great too, but the music is terrible.  Once you start to memorize it, play your own music and do her exercises.  I think Kathy is great, I really tone with the short exercises and she isn't complicated or dangerous.",1254700800,16,309,4.385964912280702
3872891,5,B0028P4WH2,"You can tell she has done this for years, not a come lately fitness personality.  Very nice and easy to understand.  Well done DVD and like the short segments.",1253836800,13,159,4.448275862068965
3872892,5,B0028P4WH2,"I really liked this workout.  I have a six year old and it's great to set aside some ""me"" time for an hour and do the whole thing.  I really worked up a sweat during the two cardio sections, and the sculpting section was great.  Loved it!",1251504000,13,238,4.0212765957446805
8356585,5,B0028P4WH2,"Well worth the money! Our group is 65 and over and this dvd is doable for us.  You can put as much or as little as you want.  It lasts a total of 60 minutes (6-10 minute workouts).  We always do the whole tape for ""Total Body Workout"".  You will need weights and a chair. Kathy Kaehler has a sweet, sly smile but she will wear you out.",1527465600,,335,3.8823529411764706
8356586,2,B0028P4WH2,Not as good as her other workouts.,1497484800,,34,4.0
8356587,1,B0028P4WH2,"I am 53 and consider my self to be in good shape. I workout to videos and I also try to run 3 three miles at least twice a week. I thought it was video was slow and I didn't find it challenging. I worked out to her videos years ago and loved them, so I was disappointed. This may be an okay video for someone who is just starting or a little older (in their 60s).",1483747200,,363,3.727272727272727
8356588,1,B0028P4WH2,Too easy.  This is appropriate for an old woman who wants to do something easy to say she is moving.,1477440000,,100,4.0
8356589,5,B0028P4WH2,"this is my favorite because it targets to strengthen and tone different areas of your body in seperate sections. With a newborn, it's not easy to make it to the gym and it's not always easy working an intense workout when you just gave birth but Kathy basically tells you how to breathe to burn more calories in your workout and even though it's low intensity, you're still super tired. I like to double up on the cardio because it's my favorite.",1466208000,,446,4.451219512195122
8356590,3,B0028P4WH2,its okay,1434931200,,8,3.5
8356591,5,B0028P4WH2,Arrived very fast and we use it most every week.,1421712000,,48,3.9
8356592,5,B0028P4WH2,"This no-nonsense workout is excellent for beginners or those who are advanced, and looking to do a light day, total body work out.  This work-out is free of high impact moves, or fancy choreography. Kathys instruction is upbeat and pleasant, the music is low volume, electronic beats. The tunes never are loud enough to distract from her directions.

The viewer has the option to do the one hour workout in its entirety, or select various training segments, which are on the DVD in the following order:
10 minutes Cardio #1
10 minutes Cardio #2
10 minutes Stretching and balance moves
10 minutes lower body moves, using body weight as resistance
10 minutes upper body moves, using hand weights, and body weight as resistance
10 minutes core training

I have an extensive fitness DVD collection and am glad this is included in my library.",1387238400,13,837,4.839160839160839
8356593,5,B0028P4WH2,"The menu is as follows: Cardio 1 is 8 min 50 seconds, requires light weights no warm up and it has a 1 min cool down.  Cardio 2 is 7 minutes no equipment required no warm up and it has about a 2 minute cool down. You're dvd controller has forward a reverse skip and it will work on this so that you may do 1st cardio and hit forward skip to take you to  second cardio and after this you may hit reverse skip to go back to cardio 1 and so on. I did each cardio twice for a total 32 min cardio workout. Both cardios will get you're heart rate way up, I'm an intermediate exerciser. Next is Stretching which is 9 minutes all athletic and traditional. Sculpting legs has no warm up and is 9 min 20 seconds, you'll need a chair, mat, small soft ball, tried and true non intimidating moves, no stretch. Sculpting arms has no warm up and is 9 1/2 minutes you will need a chair and a mat plus you're dumbbell weight preference, traditional easy moves that work, no stretch. Last is sculpting core no warm up and about 8 minutes, traditional and yoga based moves this has a 1 minute cool down. I love this dvd and all the workouts are just wonderful. You can pick which workouts to do, but this is not programmable. the set is a living room with french doors in the back, where you can look out and see a patio that leads to a yard with lush green trees and shrubs(very pretty).",1382832000,8,1369,4.104477611940299
8356594,5,B0028P4WH2,"Really like this video as it is divided into 6 different 10 minute workout sessions for different areas of the body. Just enough, but not too much...which is a good thing to keep you motivated to exercise. I got back in shape in a month by alternating the sessions every-other day!",1373760000,6,281,4.529411764705882
