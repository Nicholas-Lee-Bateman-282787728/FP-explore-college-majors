8588226,1,B00D0GMNUG,"This was one of the most stupidest movies I have ever seen.  I did not understand a single thing that was going on and the movie made no sense at all.  If you are going to make a movie like this, at least make it so people can enjoy it and not sitting through it saying what the hell is going on.  This movie sucked big time!  I highly recommend that no one watch this stupid movie",1388275200,,381,3.909090909090909
8588227,2,B00D0GMNUG,"The main problem is that the Amazon movie description gives too much away. If you plan on seeing this movie, don't read it. The film runs with a plot and subplot of two kidnappings. They come together in an unexpected way (unless you read the description). There is a quick explanation to tie the two together, and then the film continues to go off in a direction that is also unexpected.

There was absolutely no clues as to what was going to happen and if alien werewolves suddenly appeared on the screen, I would not have been surprised. I didn't like Carolyn Bock , the lead actress in this film. I thought her facial expression of anguish was over done, almost comically. The film was a boring kidnapping (s) until the plots came together. At that point it peaked my interest, but it didn't last long as I kept waiting for the film to develop into the horror film which Red Box claims it to be. IMDB categorizes the film as a mystery thriller, which is a lot closer than horror.

It makes for a lower tier mystery/thriller near horror rental if you go into it blind.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1383782400,2,1114,4.450980392156863
