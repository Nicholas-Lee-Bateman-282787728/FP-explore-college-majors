A far better film than I expected.

Second, The Conquest of Everest made me cold for nearly 90 minutes; this is all documentary footage of the actual climb of Mt. Everest; very informative and exciting for something that would be comfortable in a junior high history classroom; the packaging says the movie is in black and white (actual term is greyscale) but the film is in faded color (most of the footage at and around the peak seems black and white because everything is grey rock and white snow. This is not a Roger Corman production; the first Corman movie came out the same year (1953) and it was titled Monster from the Ocean Floor, which features probably first female lead character that can handle herself. But back to this second feature, I can't suggest it enough to people.",1350086400,,1565,4.649819494584838
