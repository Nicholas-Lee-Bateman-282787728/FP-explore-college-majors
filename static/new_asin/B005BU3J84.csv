4647352,5,B005BU3J84,"Well done, intriguing, and wildly dramatic mystery.  No solutions, really, but this exceedingly well done documentary definitely presents a fascinating tale most of us never knew about when we learned of Custer's Last Stand.  I came down on the negative side -- I don't think the man was really a survivor of the battle -- but why invent such a tale? He portrayed himself as so unheroic!  Heck, maybe he really was there!",1364515200,8,421,4.739726027397261
4647353,4,B005BU3J84,"One negative comment -- the handwriting specimen at the end was not Frank Finckle's manuscript signature. The specimen came from a clerk in Walla Walla, Washington, and this may be verified by calling the Columbia County Clerk's office in Dayton, Washington. That's the last time I ever analyze handwriting with my glasses off...The book ""Custer Survivor"" shows the authentic signatures of ""August Finckle"" in 1872 and ""Frank Finkel"" in 1921 and 1930 -- same person at different life stages. Same height, same hair color, same eye color, same fluency in German and English -- and the Prussian Archives in Berlin report NO Prussian officer named Finckle or Finkel 1869 - 1873 so that's another blind detour. Finckle and Finkel were the same person -- the man whose best friend, Sergeant Charles Windolph, MOH, coulnd't find his body. Frank Finckle was never on Last Stand Hill but he and a half-dozen other troopers broke through the Indians when C Company was shot to pieces. The other dead soldiers were found stretching out eastward for miles. Any man in their hopeless position would have done the same thing unless he caved in to total panic. Finckle was the only one that made it, but a lot of men tried to make it. Look up Lieutenant Henry Moore Harrington, Sergeant James Butler, Corporal John Foley, and Trooper Nathan Short. The production values in the documentary were outstanding and the speakers, pro or con, were all worth listening to. This was about history, not about rhetoric.",1354320000,25,1494,4.932539682539683
4647354,1,B005BU3J84,"There were no survivors in Custer's two battalions....period. All 210 men were destroyed. Reno and Benteen survived on a hill five miles to the south. Gall a prominent warrior in the battle said years later ""you would have had to be a bird to survive or a liar"". I am a ranger at LBH battlefield and have read nearly every book in the book store....",1351468800,11,349,4.384615384615385

8464297,5,B005BU3J84,"First of all, not one of the negative reviews addresses any of the evidence presented in the documentary, and the evidence is considerable. I think this documentary is credible and well documented.

As far as I can tell, Joseph Kelly and I agree on most aspects of Custer's Last Stand, but I think he is being far too dismissive of the evidence that Frank Finkel's story is true.  I might add that Custer scholars such as Dr. Louise Barnett, Jeffry Wert, and Greg Lalire believe that Frank Finkel was the lone Custer survivor.

As for the handful of accounts that claim that Finkel's body was found on the battlefield, Finkel's best friend, Charles Windolph, could not find Finkel's body even though he expressly looked for it.  So a couple of accounts that Finkel's body was found do not prove it was really found.  The fact that Finkel's best friend couldn't find his body after specifically looking for it suggests that the handful of later claims that it was identified are certainly open to question.

The documentary presents evidence that Frank Finkel provided specific details about the area around the Little Big Horn that only a survivor could have known.  This is just one of many evidences of Finkel's story.

John Koster's book Custer Suvivor presents even more evidence that Frank Finkel was August Finkle of the 7th Cavalry.",1383868800,6,1339,4.842105263157895
8464298,1,B005BU3J84,"Sgt Finckle died with his company at LBH. Part of the battlefield is called Finley Finckle Ridge. Its where the bodies of the 2 sergeants were found. 4 men identified Sgt Finckle( one a Medal Of Honor winner) and a new diary has been discovered where Sgt Allcot a friend of Finckles also identified his body and he has a photo of the brave Sergeant not the Ohio fake who people still make make money off of. Shame to destroy a brave NCO's honor to make a buck. Then again the History Channel is all about swamp people, loggers ,killing gators. Its a joke Ice road truckers are not history so its good the fairy tale was on the History channel.",1376611200,20,643,4.322314049586777
8464299,5,B005BU3J84,Gives a very different perspective on what we know about Custers last stand. A very eye opening experience for any lover of history.,1372982400,,132,4.782608695652174
