7866548,5,6304268483,I'm a huge Jackie Chan fan and I can remember searching for this DVD on an auction website and seeing it for about $100 (and that might have even been a VHS.) Now I'm able to buy the DVD for an amazingly cheap price. Couldn't be happier.,1379894400,2,237,4.0638297872340425
7866549,3,6304268483,my customer was very happy to get this movie for a decent price. Too bad I had to double ship it (and therefore double price on shipping) to get it where it needed to go.,1370822400,,170,3.8857142857142857
7866550,5,6304268483,Sammo Hung does it real well as usual. A fun story with likable characters and a sexy damsel in distress wrapped around some deliciously meaty fights. Highly recommended for any kung fu fan.,1294272000,,190,4.787878787878788
7866551,3,6304268483,"First off you've got to be a fan of some of these stars or otherwise just keep walking because these movies are a lot like the American ""Oceans"" movies, the stories are all the same and not to new to begin with. I am a huge fan of many of the stars (from the big names like Jackie to gwiallo Richard Norton) especially director/star Sammo Hung, but seriously folks this series is not his best work, and the third verse is the same as the first.

First there was Winners & Sinners (or Lucky Stars in some countries, but not in the US or HK) then came the superior My Lucky Stars. The movie's came about as Sammo Hung's genuis idea of mimicking the successful  American-Hong Kong co-production of the Cannonball Run (yes, the Burt Reynolds movie). So, he got together a bunch of stars (a-listers, supporting players and forgotten stars of yesterday) to appear in his movie which has lots of car crashes, fights and dumb jokes. The second movie worked best for me, it has the best story and action scenes, but this, the third outing is much like the first film, we even get some of the same jokes recicyled, like the horny guys in a house with one girl routine.

I just don't care for much of the silly antics of the ""lucky stars gang"", but the supporting cast is great, that includes Jackie, Yuen Biao, Sibelle Hu, and now a fresh faced Andy Lau. Jackie's role seems to get smaller with each film, as has Sammo's, but then again we have so many other characters, including the return of John Sham, who skipped My Lucky Stars. So what warrants three stars, well it's the action and martial arts scenes, silly. And they are great, from an amusing cameo by adorable 19 year-old Michelle Yeoh as a karate instructor, to the final fights pitting Sammo against Richard Norton and Jackie against Yasakui Karata. This is action movie bliss and couldn't be better, the rest of the movie, oh say, an hour of it's 92 minute run time, pretty much stinks.",1247788800,4,1940,4.47457627118644
7866552,1,6304268483,"If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting Jackie Chan's movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to ""Americanize"" and ""Control"". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way ENTIRE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to ""French version"" or ""Chinese Version"" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap ""American version"" then~! LOL",1139097600,4,924,4.8544303797468356
7866553,5,6304268483,"The fight scenes in this are incredible. Jackie Chan, Yuen Biao, Andy Lau, Sammo Hung, and Richard Norton all have some of the best fight scenes. The routine with Sammo and his freind trying to get into bed with a girl is  pretty cheesy, but hey! You watch Jackie Chan movies for action not for  Oscar caliber performances! Come on! I rank this one up there with his  other fine martial arts movies.",937094400,9,399,4.438356164383562
