8406379,5,B003V4JU2G,"This horror set is mainly from British tv, and is different from what is seen here in the US. A nice set, with many movies and shows that you will never see here in this country. Check out the Frankenstein episode.",1381968000,,214,4.2439024390243905
8406380,1,B003V4JU2G,"I bought this locally and even though I owned many of these DVDs in other collections, I bought this because I didn't have Frankenstein.  I figured that even if every other movie was was nothing but filler, I could still be happy with that.

Well, I started to watch them in order (skipping what I'd already seen) and to my surprise, the first thing I watched wasn't a movie, it was an episode from a British television show.  I started to realize that most of these weren't even horror.

But I kept plugging along, just to see if there was anything good which I hadn't seen before and eagerly awaiting Frankenstein's turn, turning back to the cover to his monster's iconic face and smiling because it was just on disk 2, side A, so close.  After watching the mediocre Black Dragons, I was finally ready to get drawn into the incredible world of the mad doctor and his creation.  I hit play and found, to my shock, the Frankenstein of this piece of garbage was a TV remake with a monster that couldn't remotely pass for the one on the cover!  The disappointment, the disbelief...  I was, am still in shock that the producers could lie this blatantly.

I have never before thrown away a movie for being bad, but this lying pile of manure is currently sitting at the bottom of my garbage and that seems too good for it.  Now excuse me, I have to spit on it.",1374969600,,1355,4.384

The good news is the TV selections are mostly smart and entertaining and the public-domain prints of the two dozen movies offered are of decent picture and audio quality.  The bad news is there's so much data crammed onto these four flippers, digital resolution is rather poor throughout.  But, hey, what do you expect for a song?  Content/presentation averages out to 3-plus stars at the price.",1365984000,5,3298,4.791887125220459
8406382,3,B003V4JU2G,"I got this the other day, and it has kept me entertained.  Mainly because nearly all the movies and television shows on it are things I've never seen before.  For the people that give it 1 star and bad reviews, I say you get what you pay for.  The DVD quality is like something you'd see on old black and white television sets.  It's been converted to DVD, but not REMASTERED as people like to say.  I bought mine for $4.08, and like I said I've been very well entertained.  It doesn't sound like I'm watching a film underwater like on other collection dvds, which is always a plus.  The films are usually only an hour long so if you get bored you don't have to watch too long to see the ending, and the television episodes come from old TV shows like TALES OF THE UNEXPECTED, and TALES OF TOMORROW, which are campy and compact as only television can be.  No... not all the movies and shows are horror, in fact a lot are Science Fiction, Suspense, Mystery, and humour.  If you buy this, buy it as a ""sampler"" DVD set.  I mean that as, what you watch you might want to buy a better quality DVD version of in the end.  For instance, all the TALES OF THE UNEXPECTED episodes I've seen on it have been great and I'm considering buying those on DVD now because there's only 8 episodes or so on this collection, but over 50 according to IMDB.  I can't deny my discs were damaged too, but only with surface marks.  As long as the video plays, I'm happy... and I think anyone that buys this as a ""sampler"" collection will be satisfied too.",1364083200,6,1531,4.256055363321799
8406383,1,B003V4JU2G,"This is NOT all movies. Most is OLD TV shows, the movies that are included are awful. I wish I had not bought it.",1362528000,,113,3.75
8406384,1,B003V4JU2G,"I received 50 Horror Classics - 4 Discs today and it is a great disappointment. The Amazon.com page selling this item does NOT make it clear that these discs are DVD-Rs. They are also in very poor condition with no labels of any kind. The discs are covered with fingerprints and dirt. Additionally, the DVD case came severely damaged. It is NOT worth even the $7.99 plus tax and shipping that I paid. The picture on the site makes it appear that this is professionaly made but the discs look as if they were made in someone's garage. Do NOT buy this unless you have very low standards.",1359504000,7,585,4.425925925925926
