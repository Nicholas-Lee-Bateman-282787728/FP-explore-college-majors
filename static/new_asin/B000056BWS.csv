7931998,5,B000056BWS,"I purchased these tapes (Physical Mind Workout - I and II) many years ago for home use while I was actively participating in Pilates studio work, and the VCR and VHS were ""the thing"".  I've always loved the program as presented on these tapes and recently bought two new tapes and had them put on DVD so I can continue to use them at home.",1442102400,,339,4.2153846153846155
7931999,5,B000056BWS,"This video is misnamed. It should really be called a Pilates Classical Matwork video.  It is worth it's weight in gold to anybody who wants a follow along video of 18 of the original 34 classical matwork exercises as taught by Joseph Pilates. The correct number of repetitions are followed. Breathing is stressed.  Since group classes held by a certified Pilates instructor can be very expensive, this video will be invaluable to anyone serious about their Pilates matwork.  I found following the expertly performed matwork by only one person, very easy to follow, and precisely what I wanted.",1124668800,2,593,5.030612244897959
