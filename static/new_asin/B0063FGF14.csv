Also, Twilight Sparkle is MAI waifu, so BACK OFF!",1327536000,,134,4.36
4935551,4,B0063FGF14,"And an improvement on the infamous Target DVD's. I just placed a pre-order, in solidarity with the rest of the brony populace and everyone else who wants to see this wonderful series enjoy a full, chronological HD release, like any other hit television series. Of course, I understand the problems Hasbro the titanic, lumbering toy giant, so used to the solid and mostly unchanging business model of catering to children with some fraction of control over their parents' disposable income, might have with adjusting to the rise of such a different periphery demographic to one of their franchises.

I'm pleased and positive towards the further development of the Brony/Hasbro relationship, with Hasbro doing shout-outs in the series proper, and doing some other outreach efforts in other mediums, like another reviewer mentioned. As also mentioned better and more eloquently by another before, there's the issue of availability and regions. I'm not from the US, and this region does not work for my DVD player.

So, as I said, this is almost completely a purchase out of solidarity, and a sincere wish to give something back to Hasbro and the team behind the Friendship is Magic TV series, since this is about the only way I can do that as of yet without being ripped off completely in the process (since not even iTunes will cater to Europe with the episodes).

All the same, while I commend Hasbro on being a little bit adventurous and for taking us in as legitimate fans of one of their franchises, that doesn't mean they should rest on their laurels. If anyone from Hasbro is reading this: we're off to a good start, really. Just, keep an eye on the major brony fora, try and make your merchandise available in as much of the world as you can, and present a big target for us to throw our money at. Believe me, we want to, but you're making it pretty hard for some, if not most, of us.

Also, to Shout! Factory (and Hasbro, for that matter): I hear you have an excellent track record of working with fans in order to make things fans actually want. Just wanna say, keep it up and work on giving us a 1080p Blu-Ray episode release-ordered Season 1 box set, with extras and goodies and stuff, and make it zoneless and shippable all over the world. I know I'd buy it in half a second, like any brony with two nickels to rub together (and a modicum of self-respect).",1327536000,5,2366,4.626190476190477

4935553,5,B0063FGF14,"The episodes on the DVD except for ""The Last Roundup"" are average and enjoyable for children and Bronies alike.  The characters are all interesting, 3-dimensional, flawed, and perfect in their own aspects.

That being said, ""The Last Roundup""...

What provoked me to buy this DVD is one thing, and one thing only.

Derpy. Hooves. Has. Dialogue.

In ""The Last Roundup"", as most Bronies would know now, Derpy's name is canon and she has dialogue.  That is why I love this show.  That is why this DVD is worth buying.
Because the production crew for a girl's show recognizes their fan base and makes fan namings canon (still not happy about Lyra/Heartstrings).

5/5 just for Derpy.",1327104000,4,678,4.834782608695652

4935555,5,B0063FGF14,"This is gonna be long.  I'm going to talk about the show in general, then move to this DVD in particular.  If the wall of text is too much, just jump to the 2 sentence summary at the bottom.

If you've spent much time on the internet lately, you're probably aware that the latest incarnation of the My Little Pony franchise, Friendship is Magic, has become something of a sensation online, and with good reason.  It's certainly true that popularity doesn't equal quality, but in this case the show definitely deserves the attention.  While it's probably not the ""BEST SHOW EVER"" or some spectacular work of art as some fans will try to pass it off as, the fact of the matter is that it's good.  Very very good.

The secret to it's success is that despite being very obviously targeted at young girls, it's so tightly written and well animated that adult males like myself can watch and enjoy it without cringing.  Yes, it can be sappy at times, but it's leagues ahead of most other children's animation targeted at girls.  In short, FIM's greatest asset is it's accessibility.  The characterization is stellar; all of the primary characters are surprisingly well-rounded and complex, and even when they get into conflicts, they manage to be believable.  The humor is universal; there's some slapstick, but most of the comedic moments are situational or character based rather than the ""gross-out"" style of humor that's so prevalent in animation today.  I don't know much about animation, but even so I can safely say that the show looks gorgeous, and the characters are amazingly expressive.

The basic plot of the show is that an overly studious unicorn named Twilight Sparkle (the personal student of Princess Celestia) and her assistant (a baby dragon named Spike), , ends up moving to the small town of Ponyville, so she can study ""the magic of friendship"" with her new friends: Pinkie Pie (who absolutely loves to throw parties), Rarity (a unicorn who owns her own fashion boutique), Applejack (who works at and runs an apple farm), Fluttershy (a shy winged pony who loves animals), and Rainbow Dash (a more rambunctious winged pony tasked with running the weather).  Every episode she (or in the second season, one of the other ponies) has to send a ""friendship report"" to the Princess about what she's learned.  There's much more to it than that, but saying exactly how it happens would be a spoiler.  Now while this whole thing sounds incredibly sappy on paper, the show pulls it off amazingly well.

While it should be incredibly cringe-inducing, FIM gets away with it by virtue doing everything with a wink to the audience.  When Twilight first gets her assignment to study ""the Magic of Friendship"", she's every bit as skeptical of the idea as the audience probably is.  When Pinkie Pie randomly bursts into song, the other characters roll their eyes.  The writers are well aware of the inherent sugariness of the premise.  Even the stereotypical ""girly"" aspects of the show get a bit of an overhaul; yes, Rarity is into fashion and is obsessed with ""fabulosity"", but she's first and foremost an artist, who just so happens to use fabric as her medium.  Even if you have no interest in clothes, you can sympathize with her as artist.  Finally, the FIM's greatest strength: It doesn't treat the audience like idiots.  Most children's programming seems to dumb everything down.  FIM doesn't.  The plots are simple enough for a child to follow, but there's enough depth to the characters that the adults can watch along and not feel insulted.  And over the course of the series, there are all sorts of shout-outs to adult viewers (for example a recent episode, not on this dvd, introduced a superhero-like character whose costume rather strongly resembles Darkwing Duck, another character uses Spider-Man's catchphrase, etc.)

So taken as a whole, the show is amazing.  Does it have its flaws?  Of course, but every show has problems.  For what it is, it manages to be great.  The writing is good, the voice acting is good, the animation is beautiful, and the morals are (generally) solid across the board.

Now, onto the DVD:

First off, as of the time of this writing ""The Last Roundup"" hasn't actually aired yet, so I have no idea of the quality of that episode.  As such, I'll be focusing on the other four that I'm also familiar with.  Also, this is solely about the quality of the episodes; I have no clue about the quality of the DVD itself.  Also also, the episodes are not in order; well they kind of are, but they're taken from across both seasons rather than starting at the beginning and working through.  The first two episodes are the pilot episodes, the third is from near the end of the first season, the fourth is halfway into the 2nd season, and the fifth hasn't even aired yet.

I have to admit, I almost knocked this review down to 4 stars because of the selection of episodes; I really don't think they picked the strongest set to lead off of.  However, even if they aren't the best the series has to offer, they're good enough that the DVD is totally worth buying anyway, especially as it's solely my opinion of the episodes.

- ""Mare in the Moon"" and ""Elements of Harmony"" were no brainers; they're the first two episodes of the series, and they introduce the setting and the characters.  They aren't fully indicative of the rest of the series, (these are more adventure oriented while most other episodes are more Slice Of Life) but they're a good starting point.

- ""Over a Barrel"" is a mixed bag; it has a very heavy emphasis on guest characters and takes place in a different setting than the rest of the series.  None of this is bad, but the primary cast isn't in the spotlight.

- ""Hearth's Warming Eve"" is a great episode, but it's an odd choice for this dvd.  It features the cast putting on a play about the history of Equestria, and as a result they're ""in-character"" most of the time.  It's a lot more interesting if you're already familiar with the cast.

So basically, while the episodes are all good, they aren't really indicative of how the show typically is.

But anyway, that's really a minor nitpick.  If you've already seen the show and like it, buy the DVD and support it.  If you haven't, buy it anyway, because while it's not ideal, it's still really good.  If you're buying it for your kids, buy it, because they'll probably enjoy the cute ponies without worrying about all the other stuff I mention.  So if you have any interest in the show, you should pick up the DVD.  It's a good value, and the more of these we buy, the more likely we'll get more DVDs.

Summary: The show has a high-enough level of quality that even if you're nowhere near the target audience, you can still enjoy it.  ""The Friendship Express"" doesn't have the best selection of episodes (at least in my opinion), but it's still totally worth buying.",1324339200,5,6876,4.679433805162365
4935556,5,B0063FGF14,"MLP: FiM is probably the best show ever made. The story tells about Twilight Sparkle and her friends getting into adventures and learning about friendship. Upon it's arrival, it has generated fans young and old and has become an instant classic thanks to the heart, soul, beauty, and genius that is Lauren Faust (wife of Powerpuff Girls creator Craig McCracken) who's creativity and brilliantness made this show a success. Now the show will finally arrive on DVD thanks to Shout! (which I dub as the next Anchor Bay). The DVD will consist of 5 or so selected episodes. Alot of people are complaining that they want a season box set loaded with features and believe me I want that too but remember, it's a kids show and kids want to enjoy it as much as the fanbase and let me say I'm fine and happy with this release as long as we get the best incarnation of MLP to date on DVD!",1322697600,41,877,4.419753086419753

4935671,5,B0063FGF14,"I, like many other bronies, bought this dvd to preserve Derpy in her original voice. It was a very short lived spotlight, but Hasbro's tip of the hat to us was MUCH appreciated by so many of us. Giving her a voice and a small role was more than we could have asked for, considering she was originally just a throw in background pony like so many others. But being the over analytical and acutely aware bronies that some of us are, an animation error hardly ever goes unnoticed. Heck, there's even a youtube series purely based on that very subject. XD

With the abundance of creativity this fandom has, we created an entire moral compass based entirely on that one wall-eyed mare. The little roles she had in the series as it progressed fueled our drive to make her into an emblem, if you will, of hope and understanding. She became the official unofficial mascot of our fandom because she represents what many of us adhere to when we became enveloped in the series: acceptance and love. I don't like using the word ""tolerance"" when it comes to what the ponies have taught and what our fandom strives to be. To tolerate means ""the ability or willingness to tolerate something, in particular the existence of opinions or behavior that one does not necessarily agree with."" Like I've told a great many bronies, our motto should be ""love and acceptance"", not ""love and tolerate"", except when faced with ignorance and hatred from others. In those cases, you do, in fact, have to tolerate that behavior to a certain extent.

Yet again, I digress.

Many disabled/handicapped fans of the show loved how Derpy was represented. Even the writer of The Last Roundup, who has a handicapped son, didn't find Derpy's initial representation to be offensive or morally wrong. But ten random mothers did, so, as a result, her voice was changed for the 2 scenes she was in, then placed back in the background on a permanent basis for the remainder of the series. Hasbro and the Hub promised to put her in random spots throughout the episodes and they've upheld that. You'd be hard pressed to find a brony who doesn't like to play ""where's Derpy?"" when an episode airs. :)

Because of what this fandom has done for this one background pony (i.e. giving her life, a name, a story, a goal, a purpose, etc), she remains one of the most special ponies in our hearts. She always puts a smile on my face whenever I spot her. To me, she represents compassion and empathy for every living being, no matter how they look or sound. She represents the good in all of us.

Yes, I know this was a very long-winded review for an MLP dvd, but I had a lot to say about the main reason it was purchased. I felt that it would be good for first time buyers to understand why this dvd in particular is so important to many of us.

Love and Acceptance! Spread that instead of hate. Be proud of who you are and never let anyone tell you that you're not special. Everyone is special, plain and simple.",1384819200,2,2959,4.500931098696462
4935672,5,B0063FGF14,"As the snow falls in a distant town, the evening draws near and the shops get ready to close. However, the coffeehouse seems to be still open, but empty. The owner is getting ready to close up shop, but he seems a bit nervous like he's waiting for something to happen before he closes. Suddenly, the door cracks, and Butch and Cassidy walk in, disguised. They happen to be rather familiar to the owner. As they make their specifically vivid order (Parfait Special with an addition), the owner recognizes them immediately, almost as if they're talking in some kind of code, and gives them the order. As B&C sit down to eat it, they wolf it down, and on the last spoonful they find a radio chip with a message. Apparently the owner of the coffeehouse is a secret agent as well, and Dr. Namba had sent them there to make that exact order as a signal for him. As they play Dr. Nanba's message, similar to before with Delcatty, an illusion image of a Luvdisc appears. In the message, Dr. Nanba tells them that he's after the ""Rendezvous Pokemon"" Luvdisc, and that as far as he knows, their best bet is to go to the Cerulean City Gym (how does he know this stuff anyway?). B&C are well familiar with the Cerulean Gym, as are they with its leader, Misty, who has ruined their plans. It's payback time!

Currently, while Misty is in charge of the Cerulean Gym, Daisy has returned from her trip and is there to play substitute or janitor. Ding-dong! They've got a visitor, and it's none other than their good friend Tracey Sketchit. As Misty greets him, he says that while at Oak's, he'd gotten an invitation from her sister Daisy to the Gym. He heard that she wants to show him some kind of new Pokemon. First of all, he asks how the other sisters, Lily and Violet are doing. Misty tells him that they haven't been around much, as Violet's been spending most of her time getting her hair done at the local salon, and Lily has been getting massages at the local chiropractor.

Suddenly, Daisy notices from the other room that Tracey's finally here, and excitedly greets him, referring to him as ""the prince"" and drags him to the aquarium room. There, she shows him the Rendezvous Pokemon, Luvdisc. As he observes and sketches it, Daisy explains that recently, she and Misty had each captured a Luvdisc, in hope of using it for the next big show. This one is Misty's Luvdisc, Kasurin, and she's very proud of it. Suddenly, Tracey notices it turn its head. As a Pokemon Watcher, he figures this must mean something important, like it's after someone. They both explain that it's attracted to Daisy's Luvdisc, Raburin. Suddenly, Tracey notices Raburin (with a crown) nearby in the tank, just as Kasurin gets a romantic look and starts to lust after it, Raburin followed. Daisy gloats about how she's proud of Raburin's pimping skills. However, the news is broken later when Kasurin goes up to it and starts flirting, Raburin rejects it and swims off.

As Kasurin sulks, heartbroken, Misty explains that this is part of the reason Misty and Daisy needed Tracey, to figure out why exactly Raburin isn't interested, being a Pokemon Watcher and all. Daisy then explains that they need them to be able to get along well for a show, but having called Tracey, she now explains that she also wants him and Misty to play the prince and the mermaid princess in her next show, hence the address earlier. Tracey sighs, not being aware that this was part of the reason she lured him here. The problem is that the Luvdiscs are supposed to kiss and create an Attract, but they can't seem to get along very well. Of course, it seems a little strange to Misty and Tracey, since they see each other as just friends, but after all, this would just be a show. However, Daisy seems to be taking this a little too far and going on, but eventually they get back on topic, to Raburin and Kasurin, and getting them to like each other. Suddenly, out of Misty's bag comes our old friend Psyduck, splashing about in the water. Misty throws him a life saver, but just then they get an idea. Raburin and Kasurin swim up to the surface, and the three watch as Psyduck floats between them. It seems Kasurin is up first and explains to Psyduck about its unrequited love. Never trust Psyduck for a matchmaker. As Raburin swims up, Psyduck asks about why it doesn't like Kasurin, and gets shot down with a Water Gun. Kasurin starts crying, and then they realize that they shouldn't have trusted Psyduck.

Suddenly, underwater, unbeknownst to them, a small trap pod is floating around, within seconds capturing Raburin! The trio then notice, as a sub pops out of the water, revealing Butch and Cassidy. After the motto and confrontation, Cassidy sends out Sableye who hurls a Shadow Ball at them, filling the area with smoke. As it clears, B&C escape the Gym with Raburin, and drive off in their pod just before Misty, Daisy, and Tracey catch them.

Before they start chasing them, Tracey gets an idea. Perhaps they should bring Kasurin and have it help save Raburin and win its love. They all like the idea, and fill a small tank with water and bring Kasurin along for the road. Kasurin seems to still be a bit sad from the rejection to cooperate, but upon hearing the plan, it gives in.

Daisy has never really driven, but this is an emergency. She's a bit excited to go driving for the first time, so she puts on her sunglasses and does an excitement pose. As they rev up the engine, Daisy feels like a pro with the wind in her hair, and they eventually catch up to B&C. However, they seem to notice they caught up in the rearview mirror. Butch tries to speed, but unfortunately this is the fastest. Daisy eventually catches up to them and yells to give Raburin back, but of course that's a hopeless case. Suddenly, they start going too fast and pass them, and Daisy has trouble remembering how to stop. Eventually she slams down on the brakes, skidding to a stop. However, B&C aren't too far behind, and their pod is also a water proof sub, so they jump off and escape into the water!

Their car is not water proof, but they do have a small raft. However, they need to inflate it. With all his might, Tracey pumps it up as fast as he can, and manages to finish as they head into the water with it. Unfortunately, Daisy doesn't have much experience controlling one of these either, and rapids shake them up. Luckily, they make it to a group of rocky islands. Kasurin is getting a little queasy in there, but Misty reminds it that this is to save Raburin and win its heart, and manages to calm Kasurin down. Daisy then notices a rocky island bigger than the others, with a cave, and figures that this must be the perfect place for the famous local TR hideout, so they go check it out

So it is. B&C are in there, watching the screen. Sure enough, they notice the raft there, and wondering if it's really possible that they found the secret hideout.

As they get out and try to find them, a panel opens behind them as a giant arm reaches out, grabbing Kasurin's tank! It manages to lift Tracey, who is carrying it, but he can't bear it and lets go. In that time, a trapdoor opens under them, and they fall. As they get up, they hear a familiar laughter, and realize that B&C are behind this as well, and now have Kasurin! A hidden door then opens, revealing the duo and their tank which Raburin and Kasurin are held hostage in!

While B&C go to report this to Namba (leaving the tank there as it's too heavy and they will be back in a few minutes), Misty and the others worry a bit, while Tracey wishes Oak was there to help. However, Misty has a plan. She can communicate to the Luvdiscs in the tank, so she does just that. Pointing at the skylight above the tank, she tells Kasurin to jump up as hard as it can to Tackle the cage open, and then somehow hit the skylight open. It's very high, and Kasurin is a little wimpy to do it, but Misty gets frustrated and reminds it that being a quitter won't get any affection out of Raburin. Looking at Raburin, it decides to give in and jump-tackle it. To no avail, he bumps the bars, which remain rock solid. A few more failing attempts with all of his might determine him more, as Raburin has her attention focused on Kasurin. Kasurin cannot give up in front of Raburin, although Raburin is starting to get a little nervous that Kasurin will hurt himself, even though she knows he's trying to impress her.

Finally, Kasurin manages to break the cage open (and yes, Raburin is relieved), and now it's time to take care of the skylight! Misty has Kasurin try his Water Gun on it, but it remains tight in there. However, a deeper breath of it sends the glass out the window, opening the skylight for escape!

Their troubles are not over. Suddenly, the alarm goes off, alerting B&C of the recent happening. Quickly, they make their way to the scene

Now it's Raburin's turn to act. Daisy has her shoot a Water Gun out through the hole, while Misty has Kasurin use its Ice Beam to freeze the arch of water Raburin is making! Sure enough, it works, and now they just have to climb out. But just then, B&C arrive on the scene, and Butch opens the trap for them, all over again! Thinking fast, Misty has Kasurin use Double Team, confusing Butch in controlling the machine to catch the right one. While he fumbles with the controller, R&K use this as a chance to escape by climbing the arch. While Butch's still fumbling, Cassidy climbs out after them, alerting him of the situation to drop it and follow (how it manages to not break is beyond me).

As the two discus fish bounce across the hills and valleys, they eventually find themselves cornered at a cliff with nowhere to run, B&C trailing them. As they approach, Kasurin things fast, motions for Raburin to kiss him. Of course, she's a slight bit reluctant, but she trusts him enough as a friend. Slowly, the two fish begin to make out and B&C are too shocked to make any moves, oohing and awing at the incredibly cute scene. But with their lips locked in place, they jump off the cliff, and form a ""butterfly"", enabling them to use their bodies as wings and glide down slowly, and safely. Clever Kasurin, thinking of a plan to score a bit.

As they land, they look at each other in acknowledgement, and it seems Kasurin has finally won the love of Raburin. Back inside the cave, Tracey has managed to grab hold of the trap pod controller which Butch forgot, and stands back with the others as he self-destructs it. Time to round up the Luvdisc and head back to the Gym!

Or not. While the couple swim towards Cerulean City, a fence pops up in the water in front of them. They assume it's just a dam, so they head back to find another way but another fence has popped up, and as they look up, they realize B&C still haven't given up! This time they send out their Pokemon, Sableye and Mightyena as Kasurin sprays Butch in the face. That doesn't threaten them, so Cassidy has Sableye go for the Fury Swipes but unfortunately, it can't physically attack them, since it's gravitated and can't swim! Butch then pushes a button, making the fences close in. Then, it's about to have Mightyena do something, but the calls of Misty and the others distract them. As they couple notice them, just as the fences are about to crush them into a valentine cookie, they jump out at the last second. Misty and Daisy then quickly discuss among themselves a plan to get rid of them, and when ready, Daisy has Raburin hold Kasurin up with her Water Gun. Mightyena tries attacking them with Iron Tail, but just then Kasurin jumps off Raburin's geyser and stops it with Water Gun yet again. Sableye then hurls a Shadow Ball at them, but R&K think fast and use the Water Gun/Ice Beam combo again, freezing the shadow ball in place! B&C are amazed and worried at this strategy, as they're worried about the Shadow Ball exploding once unfrozen. Butch tries to destroy it as soon as possible by having Mightyena hit it (as well as them) with a Hyper Beam, but Daisy has Raburin use Sweet Kiss, charming Mightyena and distracting it, before it fires the beam while it still glows at the mouth. As Mightyena swaggers about with a mouth glowing with a Hyper-Beam-to-be, it happens to spit it out in the direction of B&C. To finish this off, Misty and Daisy have both their fish use a combined Water Gun, blasting them both off. The Sweet Kiss effect seems to have rubbed off on Sableye too, and it and Mightyena playfully lick and hug each other as they blast through the air.

Back at the Gym, the show seems to be quite a big success. Of course, they don't need Misty and Tracey anymore now that the feeling is mutual with the Luvdisc as it is. Also, it seems Daisy has added an unexpected last bit into the script (might have not been there to begin with), as the Luvdisc spray the audience with Sweet Kiss. All the couples that went to see the show now feel the love stronger than ever, and applaud as the curtains close and Daisy thanks Misty and Tracey for their help.",1383350400,,12994,4.457527333894029

4935691,5,B0063FGF14,"With My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic being such a popular show these days, one question that a lot of people wonder is ""What episodes should I use to introduce someone to the show?"" Luckily, the first DVD release from Shout Factory is a good ""starter"" set for anyone who is new to the show.

The DVD begins off with the two-part series premiere, in which Twilight Sparkle, the unicorn student of Princess Celestia, arrives at Ponyville to make some friends, with her meeting up with five fellow ponies: the speedy weather-Pegasus Rainbow Dash; the crazy, party-loving Earth Pony Pinkie Pie; the fashion designing Unicorn Rarity; the apple farming Earth Pony Applejack; and the mousy, animal loving Pegasus Fluttershy. Together, the six venture out to find the Elements of Harmony, the key items needed to defeat Nightmare Moon, who has returned to Equestria after 1,000 in hopes of bringing eternal night. If you're already have some familiarity with the show, the episode may not be interesting, but it does set things up for the rest of the series.

The rest of the DVD consists of two Western-themed episodes and the show's Xmas episode. In Over a Barrel, the Mane Six (the nickname for the six main characters of the show) head to a Western town to deliver a tree to an orchard handled by one of Applejack's cousins, only for them to get involved in a crisis between the pony in the town and the buffaloes over the land (as the orchard is built over land that has been used for the buffaloes' annual tribal run). In Hearth's Warming Eve, the Mane Six takes part in Cantorlot's version of the the Hearth's Warming Eve pageant, which tells the tale of how the three main pony types (Earth Ponies, Unicorns, and Pegasi) put aside their differences and founded Equestria. Rounding out the DVD is The Last Roundup, a tale in which Applejack's decision to not return home after taking part in a rodeo in Cantorlot leads to her friends heading off to find her and learn the reason for why she doesn't want to return to Ponyville.

While these may not be the best episodes in the opinions of some fans, with two of the episodes being controversial (Over a Barrel due to its Cowboy and Indians theme; The Last Roundup due to a scene involving popular background pony Derpy that may be considered offensive when it comes to mentally disabled people), these three episodes are good starter episodes for a few reasons. The three episodes involves all six of the show's main characters (with Hearth's Warming Eve definitely showing off their personalities). The episodes gives people a good example of the humor and heart that's put into the show (especially in Hearth's Warming Eve and The Last Roundup). Finally, the episodes do give you an idea of some of the inside jokes among My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic fans (i.e. what's with all the ""Fluttershy is a tree"" jokes, why do fans connect Pinkie Pie with Marvel Comics character Deadpool, just who is that grey Pegasus that is popular with the viewers). Trust me: if you really want a good idea of what My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic has to offer, this DVD is a good starting point.

P.S. The DVD also includes the first episode of the 2010 version of Pound Puppies, which you may want to check out as well to see if the show will interest you (as well as understand another popular in-joke among the Friendship is Magic fandom).",1367712000,,3389,4.690756302521009

4935696,5,B0063FGF14,"I am one of the converted. The first season that aired on the Hub I completely missed in original airings, having grown up with the original MLP in the 80s and thinking this would be more of the same fluffy girly stuff. But, catching a chance rerun while waiting for another show changed my mind.

Lauren Faust had taken the concept of MLP and turned it on its ears, introducing character development, well-written stories, moral lessons that aren't heavy-handed, and legitimate comedy. It's easy to see why so many adults fell in love with this show, because it embraces the one golden rule of entertainment: don't talk down to your audience. Like the classic cartoons of yesteryear, it's great for kids while also being enjoyable for adults. And, despite being based on a product geared towards girls, it really comes off as more gender-neutral, which is a tremendous plus as anyone can enjoy it.

This DVD, while not having the best episodes of the series, definitely has a nice sampling of the show from the first two seasons. If anything, this DVD is worth getting if for nothing more than the unaltered version of ""The Last Roundup."" More on that below.

Friendship is Magic is the two part series premiere which shows Twilight Sparkle, apprentice to Princess Celestia, being sent to Ponyville to learn the importance of friendship. There, she meets and befriends Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Rarity and Rainbow Dash. Together, they represent the elements of harmony and use them to defeat the evil Nightmare Moon.

Over A Barrel was a controversial episode because of its depiction of the cowboys vs. Indians conflict throughout history. The ponies journey to Appleloosa where the settler ponies' apple orchard is planted right in the path of the buffalo's migration path, and they demand their removal. After a short conflict, a compromise is reached that appeases all parties. So, what's so offensive about this episode? Many feel the genocide faced by the Indians was trivialized in its toned down representation in this episode as a pie fight.

Hearth's Warming Eve is the ponies' version of Christmas. The ponies all participate in a play revealing the origin of Hearth's Warming Eve: when all the different pony tribes (earth, magic and pegasi) had to overcome their differences to create Equestria.

The Last Roundup is another controversial episode. Applejack heads off to compete in a rodeo, but when she fails to achieve the success she's had in prior years she decides to stay away from Ponyville after all the fuss they made over her at her departure. But, her friends go after her to try and understand why she hasn't come home and get her back. So, why the controversy? In the first episode of the series, a background pony was accidentally given crossed eyes, which fans latched on to and ate up, creating the fan-favorite character Derpy Hooves. Derpy continued to appear in episodes, either in the background or as part of a sight gag. It wasn't until this episode that producers decided to give a nod to the fans by not only naming her, but giving her lines. Unfortunately, the name, coupled with the eyes, her klutzy behavior, and the voice Tabitha St. Germain chose to give her (not knowing it was a girl, she based it on her neighbor's kid, a boy). That all led to people misinterpreting the character as a sleight on mentally handicapped people and caused an over reactive outcry to follow. As a result, that scene was altered with new dialogue and no name. This DVD is now the only place, besides Youtube, to see the unaltered episode.

If you or your kids are not watching this show, then you're really missing out. The stories are well-written, the characters are fun, and there are great jokes to be be found. Pinkie Pie's antics alone are worth the price of admission. Check it out today, and check out the show on the Hub.",1359244800,,3863,4.817496229260935

Going slighty off topic, it did sadden me that a show that embodies and personifies love and tolerance would give into the demands of soccer moms and ruin the fun. To my eyes, even the slightiest deformity, abnormalities, and anything to resemble the different sets them off. leaving derpy to her orginality would have further shown then even those who are different can be show what the show embodies, love and tolerance.

4935704,5,B0063FGF14,"My little boy (four years old) enjoys watching cartoons on our wide-screen TV. He has a small library of DVD cartoons, mostly furnished by my wife, and I put one on for him from time to time. One day I was in a nearby Wal-Mart looking over the cheap DVDs and I spotted a few ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoon DVDs. I bought them, remembering how much I enjoyed Tom and Jerry at the movies when I was a kid. Plus, they seemed so much better than the stuff my boy was watching and we could watch them together and both have a laugh. Well, my boy loved them, right from the first play. I was laughing too. I'm not at all surprised. Those old cartoons were just exceptionally well done. Now, when I ask what he wants to watch, he'll request Tom and Jerry. So there!

Well, my wife counter-attacked with a ""My Little Pony Friendship is Magic - The Friendship Express"" DVD. I can't stand it. It's the sappiest thing I've ever watched. It's impossible for me to sit through even a few episodes, let alone the whole DVD. Some of the other reviewers remarked about how older children, and even adults, might enjoy watching it along with the younger children. Sorry, that just doesn't work for me. It may be that I'm 76 years old. Yeah, that's probably the reason. I'm in good health and not yet senile enough to enjoy it. Hmmmm. Maybe J've become a curmudgeon.

But, wait! The DVD wasn't intended for me, it was for my little boy and he loves it! The DVD immediately catches his attention and holds it all the way through, and that's even after watching it a half dozen times. Why? I don't know why. It's not something I understand. The programming is specifically directed toward young children and evidently the producers seem to really know what they're doing. I'd say the drawings and animations are crude. Most of the lines are too bold and graphic. A lot of the action looks like colored drawings being moved from place to place and photographed. The artwork doesn't appear very sophisticated next to most modern cartoons. But, whatever I might think, the artwork and stories sure capture my boy's attention, The stories about the goings-on in Equestria, or Horselandia, or whatever it's called, are insipid and the voices of the characters grate on my nerves, but they seem just perfect for the little guy. Maybe he likes the bright and vivid colors. That probably helps. Maybe it's the oversized eyes. You know, the music is rather good and maybe that helps too. The boy has always had an ear for music and his taste is rather good, in my opinion. Who knows? In any case, if my boy had a vote, he'd give ""The Friendship Express"" five stars so that's what I'm giving it. Just don't get the idea that I'm sitting around watching it with him and enjoying it.

4935730,5,B0063FGF14,"My Little Pony, Friendship Is Magic is a great show. It's funny and adorable, sweet and realistic. The series is about six ponies: Twilight Sparkle, a smart unicorn who is skilled in magic, Applejack, a honest earth pony who works hard, Rainbow Dash, a loyal and athlectic pegasus, Pinkie Pie, a hyper earth pony who loves to laugh, Fluttershy, a kind, shy pegasus who takes care of animals, and Rarity, a dramatic yet generous unicorn. Toghether they go on adventures, save the world, and learn about friendship, just like real friends do.
Here are some short reviews of the episodes on The Friendship Express DVD:

Friendship Is Magic, part one: The episode that started it all. Twilight Sparkle is sent from Canterlot to Ponyville to learn about friendshp. Not the best episode, ecspcially for the very first. (2/5)

Friendship Is Magic, part two. Twilight Sparkle and her new friends try to defeat Nightmare Moon, a evil princess who threatings eternal night to the ponies. A great episode that has lots of funny and memorable moments. (5/5)

Over A Barrel. The ponies deliver a tree to a town called Appleloosa and learn that the ponies and buffalos of the town have been fighting. Can the ponies teach the two sides to but their differences aside? A funny episode but the ending wasn't very satisfying. (4/5)

Hearths Warming Eve: The ponies put on a play to teach others ablout the holiday of Hearths Warming Eve. I personally didn't find the play interesting, but I did enjoy the beginning. (3/5)

The Last Round-up: Applejacks goes to Canterlot to compete in a big rodeo.....and doesn't return! This is a GREAT episode. I didn't really like the beginning because it stole too much attention from most of the episode, but the rest is hilarious. (5/5)

Overall, this is a great DVD that any My Little Pony fan should have this in their collection!",1342656000,,1854,4.814465408805032

The only true flaw in this DVD is that in the first episode, Around the end, it de syucs, so episode contiunes but the sound is delayed from it.

-The voice acting is superb. Tara Strong, Ashleigh Ball, Andrea Libman, Tabitha St. Germain, Cathy Weseluck, and the rest of the actors are top-notch.
-The writing is excellent.
-Daniel Ingram is a fantastic composer and songwriter.
-The main characters are adorable and lovable.
-The show is not just for children, but people of all ages.

I only hope that by supporting Hasbro with this they make a Season 1 Boxset. Also, getting it for such a cheap price and HERE from Amazon is probably the best bet, since at least in MY experience it's hard to find at the supposed stores that do sell MLP:FiM merchandise (Which is Target).

-There were a couple of spots where the audio was off sync with the video. I had to restart the video to get it to work right.
-The extra features are decent. With a coloring page section for your PC and a brief bio of the main characters. However the opening music scene restarted for every bio, which made watching them all at once, very annoying.
-The DVD menu music got old quick.

I think for a quick DVD release with four episodes, it's decent. But not as extra feature filled as we MLP fans want. I hope they come up with a Season 1 DVD set soon.",1335916800,2,677,4.2

There is only five episodes on the DVD, but if you're a fan like I am then it is totally worth it. I am just very happy that the great little show finally made it to DVD and that the sale are actually doing quite well. That alone should be incentive enough to get Shout! Factory to release another DVD of MLP: FIM this time with more episodes on it. Episodes include:

Friendship Is Magic: Part One (Mare In The Moon): This episode starts the series out and I suppose over as well. It shows how Twilight Sparkle is commanded to stop studying and go make friends in a land she'd never even heard of before.

Friendship Is Magic: Part Two (Elements Of Harmony): Teaming up with her new friends Twilight Sparkle must find a way to save her teacher and the rest of the Pony world.

Over A Barrel: The Ponies must find a way to get the Ponies and the buffalos to get along before an entire town is destroyed.

Hearths Warming Eve: The Ponies act out a play that has real world ramifications on them.

The Last Roundup: This is the special episode, because it has Derpy Hooves in it, and she was taken out of the show at some point, because she was offensive. Anyway, she's on this DVD and it's the only way you can see her.

The bonus features are pretty good too. You get a fun little sing along and some coloring sheets that you can print out. I don't much like coloring so I will be giving those to my little sister.

Altogether a solid first DVD for the Friendship Is Magic show; I only hope that this will lead to more!

4935742,4,B0063FGF14,"Hello my fellow amazonites. How is everyone doing. My review isn't a knock on this show parse (it's brilliant) but a knock on the random and hate it's bred into my home town known as the internet.

I'm an internet user (not just an internet user). I spend all day every day listening to music and browsing the internet. Around january of 2011 i noticed a startling trend on my beloved internet. I started seeing people posting pics of rainbow colored ponies everywhere and using memes like mods are asleep post ponies (i was on head-fi forum site for audiophiles at the time). I had enough of their whole haters gonna hate attitude so i put up a war against the brony menace. It seemed as many pinked bloody pictures i could use nothing worked and it actually became popular amongst the fandom when some guy creating a gorefest short story titles cupcakes. Needless to say i was not amused. I chose a more stable pink haired anime caharacter as my profile everywhere (lucy from elfen lied) and it ticked me off greatly when someone claimed it was a humanized drawing of pinkie pie with her hair well combed. Needless to say i threw a fit and decided i'd check it out. Come summer i watched an episode on tv with my 10 year old sister and my thoughts were of mixed feelings. (generic girls cartoon with stereotypical personalities) i didn't know what to think of it and i surely had know clue why internet otakus were turning to marshmellow rainbow colored ponies. Then i saw her, rainbow dash instantly hooked me. This was of course october and i decided to give it a chance with the Halloween episode. Nothing was good in particular aside from the awesome looking evil rainbow dash with a skull on her back side. hardly surprised this impressed me so i watched the first 2 episodes of season 1 (featured on this dvd) My impressions were less then stellar. I jumped on my fav audiophile site and commented on it as there was surprisingly a large following there. I gave the first 2 episodes a 6.5/10 and claimed it was better then most everything else but i still didn't see the big deal. I stopped after episode 2 and figured meh. The people assured me it would get better after 3. So i watched till episode 6. Rainbow dash had guitar solos and that impressed me (looks like i have a favorite character) I stopped for a few months and kept my fandom a secret until january 2012 (1 year since i first noticed it) The thing was getting bigger and bigger on the internet and even teh news talked about bronies. I decided it was popular enough to talk about it. I finished season 1 and got to episode 5 of season 2. I noticed a drop in quality in season 2. And the community was started to get ridiculous. What was once a very open community was now a very closed mean unwelcoming one made up of trolls and internet psychos looking to tick people off. Needless to say the fandom was ticking me off so i backed off. Derpy and teh whole censorship of the internet crap throw me out the window and i felt like i was going psycho.

all in all this show is amazingly written but teh fandom has been polluted by hentai addicts, trolls, and people trying to make quick friends. I'll continue to praise this show for what it is however i refuse to call myself a brony or watch it any longer.

So if you buy this and things get out of hand, grab those matches and start a fire. Best to prevent it from getting into the wrong hands (trolls)",1334188800,,3427,4.393700787401575
4935743,1,B0063FGF14,"As a fan of MLP:FiM, I have to be blunt.  I will not be buying these.  I don't WANT to buy these.

The series on a whole is decent but they have picked a truly unusual selection for this DVD collection, consisting of the original 2 from season 1, episode 21 and then 2 from season 2.  I'll go through them.

The first two are pathetic, they are slow, boring and honestly a poor set up for a universe where you learn little and honestly don't care.

Last Round up is the strongest of the bunch but that's not by much.

The final two are just weak.  Over a Barrel takes what little character set up we have for the characters and literally puts it over a barrel.  The characters change personality constantly, the moral message is painful and uncovincing.  And the final episode is one of the worst of all time, out of all the episode in both seasons, it is easily the worst.  It is meant to give history on the world but instead it makes things more confusing.  There is a song in it that is painful, the characters are totally out of character and in the end, the moral message actually serves to reinforce why the characters should NEVER be friends.  It tells the history of a group of characters who hated eachother so much they couldn't be friends.

The characters are playing themselves, literally.  So when Fluttershy says ""I hate her."" It is in character, is reinforces the worst aspect of this show, that the characters cannot become friends.

So don't buy this DVD.

And yeah, I'm prepared for all the whining from bronies and thumb downs because I dared insult these truly pathetic episodes.",1334016000,5,1600,4.462068965517242
4935744,5,B0063FGF14,"This DVD includes the pilot two-parter, vital to understanding the series.  It also includes three other episodes that are not set in Ponyville, the primary location of this series.  These were good picks, because they're some of the most fun in the series.  There were some audio desynch issues, but the manufacturer sent a replacement disc upon request, and it's quite lovely.",1333929600,2,378,5.064516129032258
4935745,4,B0063FGF14,"Though I could easily watch any of these episodes online or on youtube, it feels great to have a DVD and to support the show!  For those who still don't think much of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (or bronies for that matter) don't be fooled by the girly cover and intro, this is something anyone with an open mind regardless of age or gender can enjoy and even relate to.  The music and songs are delightful (much like Disney songs or great musicals.  Wicked comes to mind.), the characters have distinct and interesting personalities, the animation and character designs are interesting, the voice acting is good and fun, the humor is great, and the action (yeah, that's right!  There is action in here!) is cool!  Though this is not in order or a full-on season DVD, it's something that can give one a taste of what the series is about and will leave you wanting more.

Plus, one of the episodes features Derpy with the original voice and scene as aired on the Hub (Look up Derpy if you want to understand the big deal.  In fact, check this out here [...].

Now as for the DVD itself, my only complaint is that one episode kind of lags and the voices and animation don't match up at one point.  But maybe that's just my disc, who knows.",1333497600,,1245,4.401746724890829
4935780,4,B0063FGF14,"I bought this DVD mostly as a gesture to show that I have interest in buying Friendship is Magic on DVD in hope that one day a boxed set will be produced. The DVD itself is honestly not the best. Quality isn't great and the menus are pretty generic, although that should be expected for something like this. As a collector item I thought it was worth the small price.",1333238400,,367,4.257142857142857
4935781,4,B0063FGF14,"The positive aspects of this disc: It's got five thematically-linked episodes on it. The first two, to introduce the characters and establish the world, and then three episodes featuring a train. (""MMMystery on the Friendship Express"" is also a train episode, but it aired a few weeks after this DVD came out.) This is a great DVD to buy to support future (and longer) DVD releases of the show, and it's also a great DVD to give as a gift to a family with a young girl. Bonus points if said family also has a son or two.

There are a few things that don't sit well with me, though. One of the first things you see on this disc is an advertisement for some G3 (generation 3) direct-to-video nonsense that no-one should care about anymore, and certainly should not be pushed by Hasbro any longer. They should completely move on to G4 and forget about marketing their G3 stuff! The art style is just horrible!

Also, Rainbow Dash is missing her cutie mark on both the front and back covers. Those old vectors Hasbro keeps using are so outdated anyway, but I didn't know that they could randomly remove cutie marks for no reason.

The DVD also has a ""Meet the Ponies"" feature that highlights each of the main six characters and Princess Celestia - except it completely ignores Rainbow Dash! So it features five of the main six characters + Celestia.

The menu music - for all menus - is a constantly looping instrumental of the theme song. And the Main main menu loops back and forth on a segment of the theme song animation where everyone but Twilight is fiddling around or jumping. But hey! It's better than that ""Celebration at Canterlot"" DVD, which only had bare-bones two episodes and cost twice as much. Another reason to get this DVD: It's got 5.1 surround sound! I love surround sound. I wish I had a 5.1 setup in my home.",1333065600,,1826,4.490963855421687

The one I received was fine, however. I was extremely pleased to notice that the original version of The Last Roundup is on this DVD, NOT the version where they removed Derpy's name and changed her voice.

The DVD includes five fairly solid episodes:

* Friendship is Magic Part 1

* Friendship is Magic Part 2

* Over a Barrel

* The Last Rounderp

* Hearth's Warming Eve

It also includes some special features: an extended version of the opening credits song, and some character profile.

The character profiles are rather childish, however, and don't introduce any additional footage.

The physical presentation is fairly good, although the box art seems a little cheap and doesn't include any original vectors.

Based on the front cover of this with cute happy ponies and the title ""Friendship is Magic"" one would expect fun, fantastical, sweet stories. The first episode in two parts is so scary my 4 yr old refused to watch it. When I checked it out it in fact was filled with bug-eyed animals that lurch out from the darkness and death defying leaps off of cliffs that make the Road Runner look sedate. Intermixed with these creepy, unsettling graphics is bratty superficial dialogue. This could have been so cute...the creative possibilities for this could have been endless.

Any brony or fan of the show in general shouldn't pass up this DVD, until we get a full season box set (I've got my hooves crossed) this is probably the best thing were gonna get.",1332460800,,426,4.532467532467533
4935788,4,B0063FGF14,"I'll start by saying that I think this show is great for kids and grownups alike. A lot of the other reviews talk about how great it is, so I won't go into detail. Instead, I'll focus on the DVD itself. Frankly, it's a bit of a disappointment for a number of reasons.

First is the selection of episodes. I think that most of the episodes on the disc were selected simply because they featured a train (in keeping with the title of the DVD). As a result, they are not the best sample of episodes from the show. ""Friendship is Magic"" (parts 1 & 2) is a good introduction to the series and the main characters, but has a very different tone than the rest of the series. ""Over a Barrel"" is the weakest episode of the first season, in my opinion; it's a good spoof of westerns, but it's story isn't the best. ""Hearth's Warming Eve"" is a good episode, but its holiday theme makes it seem out of place when it isn't Christmas time. ""The Last Roundup"" is probably the best episode on the disc, but it still isn't the best the show has to offer. All of the episodes are worth watching, but none of them would make my favorite episodes list.

Secondly, there are a number of minor problems with the DVD that just bother me. The artwork on the box and disc has a few errors. The advertisements at the start of the DVD contain misleading information (e.g. referring to ""Twinkle Wish Adventure"" as an ""all new"" My Little Pony adventure, even though it was released a year before the current MLP series premiered). The lack of subtitles was also disappointing.

On the plus side, the episodes are still very fun to watch, as are some of the bonus features. I'm glad I bought this DVD because I want to show support for the show. If you're a parent whose kids like (or might like) the show, you may want to give this DVD a try. If you're a fan of the show and want to encourage Hasbro to release more MLP DVDs, you may want to buy it. However, if you really want to watch the show and see all that it has to offer, you might be better off buying the show on iTunes (assuming that's an option for you).",1332288000,3,2087,4.238693467336684

4935821,5,B0063FGF14,"There are several reasons why I would recommend buying this dvd. For one it helps support the show and if a lot of bronies do their part and buy this it will hopefully encourage Hasbro to give us the season box sets that we so desperately want.

Secondly, because the last roundup contains Derpy's original scene that by itself is worth the cost of the dvd.

Also the extended theme, which I have to say is pretty epic, would make the dvd worth buying even if it didn't contain any of the best episodes.

About the episodes themselves Hearths warming eve and over a barrel are not my favorites but I still like them. There's only one episode I don't like and that's only because of the message. I still like it a bit because it's MLP. But that's irrelevant anyway because that episode isn't on this dvd. The first two are necessary because it introduces the characters and sets up for the series, and the last roundup in my opinion is one of the best episodes starring Applejack. Plus it's got Derpy what more could you ask for? I mean aside from season box sets.

On this dvd, it hasn't been edited (Derpy's name is still used, and she still has the old voice).

There are only 2 flaws with this dvd. 1, there is no 5.1 dual-audio, unlike the iTunes releases. 2, the coloring page is one that can be downloaded off the MLP website.

Even with these flaws, I still will give it 5 stars.",1330992000,9,602,4.513761467889908
4935824,3,B0063FGF14,I bought this Jan 1st cause it said it was a preorder to come out on Feb 28th. I didn't see any reviews show up at that time and bought it thinking it was a new movie to go with the train set that came out recently. When I got it my kids where excited but when I put it in it was no more than a few episodes that I already have on my DVR. Had I known that I would have waited and just watched them on my DVR till they came out with a box set of some sort. I don't like to waste money on the dvds if they are just a few tv episodes at a time. With that said they are still good episodes however the old classic mlp eps will always be the best!,1330992000,2,642,3.5602836879432624

Good selection of episodes. Really wish that Season One was available for a more reasonable price than what we've seen it listed at online.",1330992000,,340,4.396825396825397
4935826,4,B0063FGF14,"Okay, this review is for people who already love this wonderful series, and aren't looking for an in depth look at the cartoon they're buying.  This is for people who want to know about the content, and if there's anything they should be forewarned about.  Unfortunately, there is.

For each of the first two episodes, the audio in the second half is off from the video by about a half a second.  That doesn't sound like a long time, but it comes off as a lot longer when you're watching what starts to feel like a badly dubbed anime.  It can be ignored, but really, it shouldn't have to be.
And in the ""Pony Profiles"" section of the bonus features, Rainbow Dash is missing.  So is Spike.

Everything else you'd expect to see is there.  They left Derpy's scenes intact, despite recent controversy, and even hid a picture of her on the back of the case.

So there you have it.  A few technical difficulties, but an otherwise satisfying addition to any Brony's collection.",1330905600,,970,4.522988505747127
4935827,4,B0063FGF14,My daughter and I love this DVD! It did take a long time to receive it but other than that we are very happy with the product!,1330905600,,126,3.7037037037037037
4935828,5,B0063FGF14,"I love this series, it's quick, witty, and it has something for both the adults and the children (something that has long been an issue with a lot of tv shows) this dvd is also quite good.

first off the price, at $9.99 your getting 5 episodes (6 if you count the bonus episode of pound puppies, a different series, that is included in the bonus features) so it's the price of buying the episodes on itunes (about $2 each episode) this dvd features the first two episodes (a 2-part episode that introduces the characters) along with three episodes that appear to have been selected solely due to the fact that they have trains in them (the insert inside the dvd case advertises a toy train with the ponies which is why I draw this conclusion) but that isn't to say that they're bad, in fact they're all great episodes (the whole show is amazing but I digress) for instance the episode over a barrel is about a group of ponies that plant an apple orchard on the traditional stampeding grounds of a group of buffalo, the two groups bicker which builds up to a large scale battle (involving apple pies mind you) the whole episode flows really well and it has both a lot of great laughs and a solid ending. one episode on this set is actually (in a weird way) controversial. see the series became very popular with older audiences for it's humor (there are references that no child will understand but an adult will completely get and jokes that children will get that parents might not) and one of those humorous bits was a pony named derpy hooves by the fans (it was a background pony that has one eye looking up while the other is looking down, it was originally a flub by an animator who thought the face was going to be obscurred and decided not to fix it but since then the amount of people who enjoyed the specific pony exploded to the point that in other episodes where the pony appeared (with correct eyes) they actually went back and ""derped"" them so that they matched the first episode. it was an interesting instance of where the creators of the show were interacting with the fans. as the show grew bigger and reached an even wider audience the episode the last roundup was released, in it derpy hooves is not only spoken of by name (shortened to Derpy) but she actually has a speaking role with a slightly in-effeminate voice. fans were overjoyed that the character had been portrayed not only as they had expected her to but voiced in a similar way. the problem was that a very small minority of people felt that the character was portrayed as retarded and that it was insulting the mentally disabled. (though to be clear while derp was originally a rude gesture towards the mentally disabled, it has since become almost unknown to that meaning, instead meaning clumsy or ditzy (for instance if you were to bump into a door you'd say derp, at your own clumsiness, it's not a derogatory word anymore, instead just being the new ""butterfingers"") the episode was edited to remove her name, fix her eyes, and change her voice to a more feminine one for the itunes release but this dvd version still contains the unedited original. personally I prefer the original but it might be different for someone with a disabled child or with a different background so I thought I'd mention it.

the bonus features are also quite good, there's an extended opening sing-a-long video, profile videos for all the ponies, a printable coloring page, and a bonus episode of the new pound puppies tv show.

all in all this is a great set, it's not overly expensive and contains a decent amount of content, and the show itself is quite fun and can be watched over and over without feeling stale.",1330905600,3,3683,4.543674698795181
4935829,5,B0063FGF14,"My daughter LOVES My Little Pony...Which is great because I think My Little Pony is a much better show for her to watch than Spongebob...So I figured I'd buy this for her as a surprise and she hasn't stopped watching it. She wants to take it everywhere. I even found myself watching it and was very interested in it. I plan on buy some canvas to paint her favorites, Apple Jack and Rainbow Dash as a birthday gift for her.

But overall a VERY good movie. I would recommend this to anyone with a daughter who loves horses.",1330819200,3,521,4.316326530612245
4935830,4,B0063FGF14,"This DVD is pretty awesome. Four radical pony adventures on one disc with bonus content. Bonus content includes opening theme sing-a-long and coloring pages. And on top of all that, ""The Last Roundup"" contains the original ""Derpy Hooves"" scene, so bronies ought to get their copies ASAP before it's changed!

One complaint though, is that you're bombarded by an advert for a G3.5 cartoon DVD when you put it on. Shout Factory, get it together! ""Friendship is Magic"" is far too classy to be lumped in with the likes of that crap! And those ponies are downright freaky looking compared to G4 ponies. You guys trying to scare the kids? Sure scared me.",1330560000,5,648,4.734513274336283
4935831,5,B0063FGF14,"Finally...Well after all those months we finally get a DVD release of Friendship is Magic.  I'm pretty sure all of the other reviews gets the show and all the ponies down so I really want to focus on the DVD itself.

Most of the technical specs are listed on the package but I'll add them just in case:

2.0 Stereo.  My PowerDVD info shows it to be 5.1 but I wouldn't trust it (as it could be complied as Stereo).
1.78 Anamorphic Widescreen (as in the TV show).
2011 (implying that production is obviously going to be months ahead of The Last Roundup's original airing).

It's not listed and I've checked there are no subtitles or closed captioning.

As for the package so far I just wonder if the slip in the DVD case as well as the first preview was ""some sort of cruel joke"" to us bronies.  At the same time I wonder if The Last Roundup was redemption for that as well as a foreshadowing to what has come to that episode.

One of the bonuses included requires a computer and Adobe Acrobat Reader to print out the coloring sheet.  It's just one sheet (wish it was more, actually) but at least it's faithful to the show.  The other bonuses are the Sing-Along (or to some the extended opening) and a pilot episode of another show on The Hub...Secret but fun!  And the meet the pony videos.  Well the same factually incorrect ones on the Internet (like Celestia being the only Alicorn).

My only comment about the episodes selected is that I particularly don't like Hearth's Warming Eve simply due to the weird history it puts in Equestria.  However I have a feeling that outside the two part opening the episodes were picked because they all have trains.

As for any technical issues I can't think of any.  The season 1 episodes look better than what is on iTunes however I have a feeling that season two's coloring is just slightly different.  My only complaint is how all menus have the MLP theme and that the cursor they picked was a butterfly.  Note: On my computer I notice audio issues in the two part pilot.  I should of watched the whole thing but didn't bother to think it would happen.

It's made in the USA.  Not like it matters but adding it.",1330387200,2,2154,4.402531645569621
4935832,5,B0063FGF14,"I wanted to wait until this arrived, and since it has it's time to review. Bronies have been asking for a DVD set for a long time, and while this isn't quite that it's a great start, and IMHO has the best selection of episodes to introduce new viewers to this unique show. It starts out with the two part pilot ""Mare in the Moon"" and ""Elements of Harmony"", introducing our cast and showing how magical this adventure will be. After those we get to my personal favorite from season one, ""Over a Barrel"", a fun wild west adventure that teaches that communication and cooperation can help avoid large conflicts, and a lack of them can help cause them. Next up in ""Hearth Warming Eve"" we learn of part of the history of Equestria by learning how it was founded and teaching us that constant hatred for someone leads to destruction and even though we all are different in many ways we are still the same on the inside. And finally the famous ""Last Roundup"" staring Derpy Hooves with a guest appearance by Applejack and the gang. I kid, Applejack learns that you can't just run from your problems, you have to face them, and your friends will be more then happy to help you out, with or against your will at times.

This DVD also includes an extended version of the theme song, it's quite punny but it's also a lot of fun and is presented in sing-along style. A Meet the Ponies is also includes, it's just a bunch of quick videos that say something about each of the main 6 ponies. There is also the pilot episode of Pound Puppies ""Yipper Caper"". And finally a print out coloring sheet.

Now onto the more personal stuff. I fired this DVD up in a Blueray player hooked up via HDMI to a 42"" HDTV and it looks and sounds great. The first thing I did was went right to ""Last Roundup"" and checked the Derpy scene, she's still there, she's still Derpy, it's the same as when the episode aired. I took a look at some of the other features and they are pretty solid too. The sing along like I said is full of puns, but it's fun puns and everyone should be able to enjoy them. The pony profiles are a bit on the light side, it's more just little things that the kids can watch and see their favorite pony. The Pound Puppies, I dunno, I may watch it when I am bored or something. It's like when you watch a Super Mario Bro's Super Show DVD and it includes one episode of Legend of Zelda, it's not what you bought the DVD for but you'll probably watch it anyway. This DVD's bonus features are geared to the audience the show was intended for, and really the only thing that'll get eaten up by Bronies is the extended theme. But like I said before this is some of the best episodes to introduce new viewers. This would make a great gift for a child who hasn't watched the show yet, or for the Brony to introduce the show to his friends. They did a really good job with picking out episodes and that is what counts with this DVD.

In the end I have to go right back to the beginning and say it's a great start. I would love to see full season DVD sets come out, but for now this will do and this will do quite nicely.",1330387200,2,3099,4.213804713804714
4935833,5,B0063FGF14,"Well, this may not be a season box set, but I suppose it's a start. I'm surprised that they're releasing such a grab bag of episodes. From both seasons. Personally I would rather wait for a season box set, but these are all solid episodes that give the entire mane six a chance to shine. Very safe choices, and definitely enough to make me want to buy it. And even if anyone wants to wait for a season box set, I say buy these anyway, because if these DVDs sell well, then Hasbro just might decide to give us our effing season releases.

I guess my opinion can be summed up with:[...]",1330041600,2,584,4.214285714285714
4935834,5,B0063FGF14,"THIS DVD INCLUDES A SPECIAL FEATURE THAT IS THE ENTIRE 2 MINUTE LONG INTRO THEME! *ahem* My sincerest apologies for using the Royal Canterlot Voice, but I am positively ecstatic about the complete intro song. Alright, enough with the botched attempt for talking in fancy. Daniel Ingram is an awesome /)^3^(\ composer and I would love to hear the theme song in the original way he composed it. The regular intro on the show is only 30 seconds long and it has already been turned into some of the coolest remixes ever. Imagine what would come of a DVD quality (if only ponies came in Blu-ray) full length 2 miniute theme song.

Episodes are:
1. Friendship Is Magic part 1 (aka Mare in the Moon)
2. Friendship Is Magic part 2 (aka Elements of Harmony)
3. Over a Barrel (wild west/cowboys and indians)
4. Hearth's Warming Eve (the Christmas special)
5. The Last Roundup (the Derpy episode)

Get this, theme song alone makes it worth it. *brohoof* /)(\

Edit: Daniel Ingram did not only compose the theme song, he actually edited Lauren Faust's lyrics to the point that he is accredited with 25% of the lyrics in the extended version.

Edit: This finally came in the mail and I couldn't be happier. I got the first run de-synced audio version. Why in equestria is de-synced audio good? you may ask. Well the answer is simple. First since shout factory is offering to replace the glitched disks and future runs will all have synced audio, it will be rare/collector's item to have the de-synced audio. Secondly, the dy-sync isn't really that bad. It's only in a small part and off by a bit.",1329350400,6,1583,4.602836879432624

I came to Amazon because I would like to financially support Hasbro's product, but I have no intention of buying any toy ponies. However, I would like pay for something I have been enjoying for seasons now.

I want My Little Pony to succeed. I want many more well written episodes with dynamic, multi-faceted characters. I am willing to pay for this to happen, as I am sure many Bronies are.

The problem is with the selection of format. It should be in Blu-Ray in 1080p resolution as the show already is, just burn a disc. We'll buy it. Secondly, it should be the entire season chronologically. With Blu-Ray, it would probably fit into two discs. That's okay, just charge more. Again, we'll pay.

From MY KIDS perspective, (and the only reason I gave it 4 stars) this is probably not the BEST choice of episodes. They do not really care as much about charactor developement. While the first 2 episodes are virtually essential to the rest of us, my kids, boys 5 and 4 and girl 2 1/2, don't really care. They just want the scenes that make them laugh. Baby Cakes or Griffin Brush-off are their favorites and the ones they would have picked. Out of the episodes on here, I'd say my kids like the same one as most bronies would pick, The Last Roundup. And oddly enough, for the same scene. They find it hysterical that Derpy is so clutsy and the town hall is falling apart. I have not decided whether I will buy it yet or not as I am still letting them watch it on youtube but we do not have cable so I most likely will end up buying this DVD. I LOVE that My Little Pony is now written in a way that draws more boys into it. While I do not mind my boys watching some boys shows, many of them are just TOO violent for me to allow.

Friendship is Magic is a wonderful work of animation, and a wonderful new piece of the world. I am absolutely hoping for bigger and better releases in the future, but knowing the situation behind the production and release of the show, I am happy to buy this.
