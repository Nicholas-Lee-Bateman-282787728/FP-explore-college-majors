8486659,2,B005TZFYY8,"Sadly, I am NOT happy - I really had looked forward to this DVD - but ...a) it is not closed captioned - and as someone with a hearing loss (major) this was the first disappointment - and b ) the sound and video quality are NOT what I havve grown to expect from a product I buy from Amazon - I'll likely play it all the way through - and hope to hear enough to make it worth my investment - but so far - the viewing is not a clear, crisp product and I can't hear it at all....  so disappointed ....",1486512000,,498,3.7884615384615383
