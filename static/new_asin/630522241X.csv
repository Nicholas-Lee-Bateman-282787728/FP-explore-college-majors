995471,1,630522241X,"I have a large collection of IMAX DVDs. I enjoy them because the video quality is usually stunning. Playing them on my 65 inch screen normally produces a very fine picture. I don't know what happened with the transer on this film, but it is poor at best. Black and shadow areas are filled with artifacts and the overall picture quality is very grainy and rough appearing.  The company responsible obviously chose to go the cheap route on the video tranfer. Also, I agree with the previous reviewer about the cliff climbing botanist. Too much time was wasted on this guy climbing a cliff without a line or safety helmet. The whole sequence may have been staged. I cant believe anyone would be so dumb and reckless to do this without some basic protection. This DVD will not be a keeper in my collection.",1152057600,,802,4.569444444444445
995472,3,630522241X,"I agree with the first viewer.  It's better on the big screen- also it is very short. If you really want to experience what it's like to sit on Hawaii's beaches virtually, I'd highly recommend ""Hawaiian Dreams.""  It beautifully captures the different beaches and sunsets on all 6 islands.",995241600,,288,4.857142857142857
995473,3,630522241X,"I saw the movie seven times at the IMAX theater in Hawaii.  I thought was a really fun movie with spectacular imagery, especially when rendered in IMAX.  But watching the video, I realize that most of the fun of this movie was in watching it on the giant IMAX screen.  The movie should still be interesting for people who haven't seen it before, but it was really meant to be viewed as larger than life, in the way that only IMAX can.
A good movie for fans of Hawaii, and a nice reminder for those who have seen it on the big screen, but if you have the chance, by all means watch it in IMAX.  It will blow you away!",985996800,,616,4.066115702479339
995474,4,630522241X,"IMAX always delivers great movies with even greater scenery. This movie focuses on the scenery that is nearly inacessable to the normal person. It takes you all the way from the edge of volcano at 10,000 feet, to the depths of 4,000 feet under the ocean to watch the newest island being formed.
Hidden Hawaii does show the hidden aspects. It shows you the Silversword flower that only grows in Hawaii, and also the Alula plant that clings to the steepest and highest cliffs. This movie will surely not dissapoint.
The only downfall of the movie, like most IMAX movies, is that it is rather short. It's a great 35 minutes, but I would have loved more.",978134400,17,650,4.564102564102564
995475,3,630522241X,"I ordered this DVD as I plan to visit Hawaii in November, and wanted to see what I could look foward to.  This DVD did not deliver however.  It's  very cinematic (thanks to the Imax filming) and the music/commentary is  good, but don't expect shots of mainland Hawaii or the islands.  The DVD is  good if you want to know about the botanical and geological aspects of the  islands, but not if you are looking for a traveller's guide.  The smart  money (IMHO) is with the Lonely Planet guide to Hawaii - much more  insightful, and more useful.  And it lasts considerably longer than 30  minutes!",966384000,20,594,4.5
995476,3,630522241X,"This is a great film for seeing how the earth has changed, and is changing. Its sort of a behind the scenes look at Hawaii's newest island--not due for a thousand lifetimes yet. But I was hoping for more  shots of beautiful beaches, and crystal blue water.",953337600,6,256,4.446808510638298
995477,4,630522241X,"Of my favorite imax movies that i have this movie  rates as one of my best picks.  the spectacular senery takes me back to hawaii every  time i view this  movie. the sound track to the movie is awesome on it's own.  sometimes, I like to just listen to it and read-that's how good it is!  If  you have ever been to hawaii you'll really love every minute of this imax  movie.",946857600,5,373,4.083333333333333

7885855,4,630522241X,"This video was interesting although it was not about areas that can be explored on your trip to Hawaii.  It is about research on areas and species that only researchers and scientists see. I should have known from ""The National Geographic""",1266969600,18,239,4.829268292682927
7885856,5,630522241X,"I don't see captions on my DVD, but the subtitles are adequate (although no musical description, sounds, etc.). The annoyance was that I had to turn the player OFF when I realized captions weren't showing because simply stopping and restarting the player didn't take me all the way back to that menu.

At any rate, it's pretty close to the kind of Hawaii DVD I was looking for--lots of scenics of flora and fauna. I could have stood more plant and flower pictures, but, then, I guess most of them aren't hidden. :D

I really wish I'd gotten the set with the Alaska production, too.",1187308800,,581,4.523809523809524
7885857,1,630522241X,This is the most boring IMAX presentation I have ever seen.  It is painfully slow moving.  I couldn't play it through. It is only 35 minutes but it seemed like 2 hours.  I couldn't make it anywhere near the entire 35 minutes.,1155340800,,225,4.309523809523809
