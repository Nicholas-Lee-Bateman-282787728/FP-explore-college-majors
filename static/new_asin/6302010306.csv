415446,3,6302010306,"I remembered watching this when it came out in theaters in early 1980. Watching it now, I realized how little story there actually was. It goes into a lot of detail about how a carrier is actually run, and that was fascinating. But there were way too many shots of jet flybys with heroic music to pad the movie out. Nothing was talked about the SF event they experienced, and overall it was a ""the Navy is great"" movie. The American Navy is great, but thirty minutes could have been better used on additional story. Writer Martin Caiden did a novelization, and maybe one of these days I'll read that and see what he came up with to explain the time travel event. In his very limited role, Soon Tek Oh's performance was very good. Farrentino and the others did well, but even Kirk Douglas didn't have much to work with, playing second fiddle to the carrier itself.

Historically, this movie out just after Carter's attempt to rescue the hostages in Iran, the ill-fated Eagle Claw mission, which was a pivotal factor in Carter failing to win re-election. The mission was overly complicated, had bad intel from the CIA (who had already failed to anticipate the revolution in Iran itself); the Army, Navy, and Air Force were not used to working together on joint operations, and there was NO leeway on each phase. Many good service people died, and it was a real black mark on the command staffs for all services. Carter lost to Reagan and his gredy and corrupt cotorie (Secord and North should have done time in Leavenworth), and very few remarked that the hostages were released after Reagen gave the Iranians their money. I have the greatest respect for the men and women of our armed forces. But the Navy must have thanked God for this ""feel good about our military"" movie coming out so soon after the Iranian disaster. General Smedley Butler was right. War is a racket.",1523404800,,1870,4.615615615615615

Now I have to replace (ship back the DVD) and hope the correct movie is actually returned to me.  My main concern is that the actual DVD had the correct title - so I have to wonder how many of these DVD's went out with the incorrect movie!",1523232000,,427,3.953488372093023
415450,5,6302010306,"This is one of my most favorite movies! Part of this movie was filmed in Key West Florida, and I just happened to be vacationing there on my high school spring break. my best friend and I were staying with her older brother who was in the U.S. Navy. We stayed with he and his wife in the Navy base in the married housing. We were at the beach one afternoon and got excellent and very up close photos of the jet airplanes used in the film ( which I still have to this day).  The planes were making passes in sets of three back and forth along the beach over the ocean.  We knew the Hotel that the actors were staying at , and went to the restaurant/bar to maybe get a peek at them, but, we never saw a one. I have always been into Science Fiction, and this movie will not disappoint! I am very interested in anything to do with Pearl Harbor. Fantastic movie !!",1523232000,,859,4.076923076923077

415582,5,6302010306,I saw this in Okinawa when it first came out. My Father was in the NAVY. Seen many Tomcat's close up and actually at 16 sat in a cockpit. The Tomcats where a great asset to our country. Long live the Tomcat's and our Tomcat Drivers RIO's that sat in the back seat <3,1513382400,,266,3.9444444444444446
415583,5,6302010306,"As an aviation buff, I appreciate the excellent photography of the naval aircraft in carrier deck operations, cat shots, arrests, etc. Some of the best video one can find of F-14s, Corsairs, Vikings, Hawkeyes, etc. Nicely done.  That's about all the good stuff.  The concept is interesting but I would have liked it if they had come up with a nice Sci-Fi explanation of the ""storm.""  I thought the whole thing with the rescued Japanese pilot was super-lame (but love that actor).  The way they got rid of the senator was brilliant if poorly acted and the effects were way off base on the conclusion of that part of the story (could have shown it with a little bit more realism, not instant Ka-boom).  Nice how they brought the CAG (Owen) and the girl back at the end.  Wish they had developed that a little bit more, too.  Like how did he get the name Tidewell, and how did he become the big DoD contractor, etc.  What would have been really cool:  this was an ""experiment"" or application of some new time-displacement technology that some military whack-job (CIA, shadow-government type thing) thought would be a great idea to go back and kick the Japs asses, wipe out the Axis Powers and then the Russians.  But then, cooler heads prevailed and they re-applied this technology to retrieve the Nimitz just in time.",1513382400,,1315,4.653679653679654

Possibly the author was not familiar with the military, but then they will also say, he wrote it that way with ""dramatic license,"" to make the story more interesting.",1512345600,,323,4.4

415648,5,6302010306,"Oldy but goody.

Come on people, this movie was made 37 years ago. Air war was the reality of military conflict so it was only right that Hollywood reflected that. Now its all desert war movies because that's where the potential threat comes from these days.

The aircraft footage you just don't see anymore, the only other movie that did was Top Gun, and it grossed a ridiculous amount of money. This movie has that old movie feel because of the actor lineup, Kirk Douglas is old school. So watch this movie not for the special effects but for the Sci Fi possibility aspect. It was 1980, come on, give it a break.

If you are into military aircraft, this movie will float your boat.",1511827200,2,683,4.448

415651,1,6302010306,"If this was a comedy, I might have rated it higher. However, it wasn't a comedy so I'm giving this movie one star (I did like the Navy footage, and almost rated it higher). It left my mouth wide open in disappointment cause nothing happened. The writers could have done so much more with this story-line, but chose to send a carrier back in time to take what basically turned out to be a leisurely cruise through the ocean... before coming back to the original timeline. I can't shake the felling like nothing happened in this movie, and that someone took a crap in my mouth while I was in awe over the disappointment. I would have been satisfied if anything at all happened like... a sewage system fails on the Nimitz, all the crew were issued red bags to crap in, and some poor sailor ends up with the duty to collect all the bags each day. That would have forced me to rate this movie with five stars! but it didn't happen.",1511654400,,926,4.327586206896552

415653,3,6302010306,"If you like the science fiction about time travel and alternate history this movie might be for you.  It's not a great movie, but it's okay, definately worth watching if you're into the genre.  Some of the acting is a bit rough, but I think they used actual Navy crewmembers for some of the small supporting  roles.  Almost the entire movie takes place on the USS Nimitz, which being commissioned in 1975 was a relatively new, state of the art carrier for 1980.  There aren't a lot of special effects, and what there is  look very dated by today's standards.  It has that low budget made for TV movie feel to  it.  The story is pretty thin, almost like they took a short story out of Omni magazine and turned into a movie.",1511136000,,722,4.368421052631579
415654,5,6302010306,Love this movie and this blu-ray version lets me view it in theater quality like when it was first released. Good extras which explain how this project came to be. An original concept which is rare for Hollywood these days. I still get goose bumps watching the Jolly Roger F-14 Tomcats mixing it up with the Japanese Zeros. If you like TV shows like Outlander and other time travel based media you should give this a try. Theme song is one of the most easily recognizable and lifts your spirit.,1511049600,,494,4.5

I guess I'll have to look elsewhere for that information, but I thought it was a very interesting movie.  It has all the elements, and as old as it is, I can't imagine why it isn't very well known.  I am always curious of time travel type movies and books, but too many of them have a contrived air about them... this movie is one of the exceptions.

I think the idea of a modern day carrier time traveling back in time is a good one. I have no problem with the plot. I had problems with the sailors acting in the movie. Sailors are not actors and my god they were horrible. Good sailors but lousy actors. They should have hired real actors. Another thing that made the movie just plain wrong was the uniforms the sailors all wore. The uniform were clean and not-faded . Looked like they had all just bought new clothes. The uniforms were just as forced as the acting. It has been a long time since I forced myself to watch the movie on DVD and it was just as bad the second time.

I often pondered as a kid how cool it would be if we could send back some modern weaponry to WWll and kick some Axis ass;  I didn't realize someone had already made a movie of it before I was born.

Stunning visuals throughout the entire movie and seeing F14 Tomcats making aerial maneuvers with Japanese Zeros was amazing.

Most of the goodness ends there though.  I've seen plenty of older movies with bad writing, cheesiness and gaping plot holes but this one takes the cake.  The actors playing Navy guys that clearly never held a rifle in their life (yes I know, this happens in modern movies too but it still bothers me), a chopper that explodes mid-air because someone fired a flare gun (come on, really?), the carrier traveling through time and in-flight jets somehow manage to show up to land minutes later.  I spent most of this movie semi-infuriated that almost no one contemplates the implications of getting directly involved in one of the most important and galvanizing events in modern American history.  Wouldn't every single Navy person intimately understand how Pearl Harbor turned the entire US population at the time from being staunchly anti-interventionist to being all for getting in the war?  They get saved from irretrievably damaging history by the time portal conveniently showing up in front of the carrier again and recalling their jets just a couple minutes engaging and probably destroying the entire Japanese strike force.  The fact that it almost happened was extremely aggravating for me beyond reason.

While the basic story holds up pretty well today the movie is a bit dated in some ways, but I think those don't matter much to enjoying the movie. For me (begin a Navy brat from the 1960's and 70's) I found the Corsairs and tomcats on the carrier pretty interesting. While the movie kept my interest and entertained me, it felt like they didn't quite nail the ending. I was left wanting a better plot twist. I don't want to give away anything to first time viewers. The ending does tie up loose ends.

The cast is excellent for its day with Kirk Douglas, James Farentino, Martin Sheen, Katharine Ross and Charles Durning. Oh yes - and Ron O'Neil of SuperFly fame.

Of course having Kirk Douglas acting as the captain was not much of a leap for him.  He also served in WW II in the US Navy and was discharged for injuries suffered while on duty.

Visually it's exceptional for a 1980 release and looks like it was re-mastered in at least half the shots (the flight ops ones to boot for us flight junkies).  The tight-in shots in crew quarters and dialogue scenes are lower quality but man the flying shots and most deck shots are superb transfers to HD and look to be almost shot in HD if you didn't know better.

The music score I see was getting slammed in another review but having grown up seeing this movie way back when it's stuck with me through the years as a favorite with clear themes from the battle march to love theme not far removed from a 1977 movie with a much larger budget that carries on to this day from a Lucasfilm catalog. :)

It's a fun yarn with good actors delivering to the best of their abilities within a very confined script that feels much more like a short story adaptation of a Ray Bradbury story than anything but that's just fine for a 1 hour 45 minute watch and trip down memory lane.  This almost begs for a re-make with today's modern CGI abilities but I then again, I just love it for what it is.

If you've never seen it - watch it through the eyes of 1980 and have fun. If you have seen it (and the many versions that were VHS quality 3:2 transfers, watch the Amazon version which is 1080 and in full letterbox format and be as surprised as I was how stunning the visuals are now compared to previous viewings.

1) A flare gun destroys a late-20th century helicopter with one shot, and we're meant to take this seriously as an emotional moment.
2) The film wants us to think about the dilemma of using modern tech to ""correct"" major American defeats, but it largely leaves that question for the audience to ponder. Very little of the film actually wrestles with time travel or what it means, and by the time we get to the moment in which a decision is made, the Mcguffin time portal storm of doom shows up and renders all of those decisions moot.

Question: if you could do it all over again would you? And what would you do differently?  This movie gets a C+ for effort. It's a shame the best part of the film came towards the end.",1505606400,,515,4.457446808510638

The film portrays how a real nuclear carrier skipper might respond to the novel time travel situation and was not overly concerned with character development.  Some questions about time paradoxes and ethics are posed, and there is drama involving the civilians, but the ship and her crew are never made to act out of character. The filmmakers stopped short of epic action, which makes the viewer appreciate questions raised but not answered.

The musical score is what I can only describe as hokey military bravado; it adds a cheese factor that would not be there otherwise. The Native American executive officer's lines all sound dubbed in; what was the problem during shooting? Do it over if the audio came out flawed, instead of rendering the character as an annoying occasional commentator. As for the script, there's too much forced emotion where it's not needed (character outbursts while discussing their predicament) and not enough where it is needed (such as in a critical incident where some shipmates have been shot) .

I liked this movie and wished there were not such unfortunate missteps. Again, just a few adjustments and this would have been a five-star winner all the way around.",1505174400,,976,4.838323353293413

What makes both movies great (Final Countdown predates Top Gun by six years) is that they are among the last films made using actual aerial footage rather than cheesy CGI. For aviation buffs they both rank right up there with the likes of ""The Great Waldo Pepper"" for their authentic footage of real airplanes in flight.

Of course every time travel tale comes with a paradox and in this film I could never wrap my head around how Commander Owens could have been on the Nimitz at the same time that Mr Tideman was in the limo on the dock seeing them off.

Even after I've grown into an adult and have learned many things regarding plot structure and character, this movie has never been ruined for me. A while ago, it came on DVD and I immediately scooped it up and greedily consumed all the extras.

The acting is above par, with the exception of one spot, but then again there aren't a lot of extremely challenging character moments. It's fairly straightforward and economical storytelling. Very unsentimental. The dogfights are fantastically authentic, the best aerial cinematography ever recorded. The setting and the recreation of Navy life on an aircraft carrier are the closest you can get to the real thing, granted the movie is peppered with real sailors in the background and with speaking roles. It's a strange mix of b-movie plot with tentpole production values. Apparently, this movie started life as a Troma film, which is why you see Lloyd Kaufman credited as an Associate Producer and eventually landed a supporting role as the signal officer.

Also, keep an out for the producer, Kirk Douglas' son, Peter Douglas. Once you realize it's him, and his interaction with the Captain, you can't help but smile.",1504915200,2,1259,4.962085308056872

I think if this movie were filmed with today's writers of science fiction, they could have written a story to explain the storm, say chalk it up to an experimental nuclear power engine that created the storm that Mr. Lasky somehow had snuck on board that inadvertently triggered the time storm.

416054,4,6302010306,"When it comes to science-fiction, time travel is always a fascinating theme.  Here we have the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz transported back to Peal Harbor, December 6, 1941. Of course, the premise is fantastic and resembles the science fiction more appropriate to television a la Rod Serling's Twilight Zone, the Outer Limits, or Irwin Allen's campy but fun Time Tunnel; nevertheless, director Don Taylor manages to pull it off successfully for 100 minutes. Part of this must be attributed to the acting by Sheen, Farentino, and Douglas who look and sound credible throughout.  There is an authentic feel of earnestness and veracity to the film, owed in part to the enormity of the subject and the men who work and live within the Nimitz and, of course, a most tempting proposition: suppose you could change history? Would you?  Of course, there is the guilty pleasure of seeing two Japanese Zero fighters literally obliterated by an F-14 Tomcat and an intriguing ""what-if"" storyline spoiled only by a lackluster and unsatisfactory ending which disappoints",1501286400,,1056,5.127906976744186

However right at the very moment anything interesting is actually going to happen, ( vis--vis some interaction between the two forces) , up pops that old time-warping storm again and it's just safely back to the present having done literally nothing!
I was hoping they would take out the Jap. fleet, prevent the Pearl Harbour bombing, and then show what changes this action would bring on the modern world!

I thought it would be slightly better but this remastered version is just as it had come out a few months ago. Picture quality and sound are superb, and thus disc includes the extra features as in the DVD set. Even the story stands up well even if the technology depicted in the movie is from the 80s. As with most time travel stories, it brings thoughts of 'what if' and the changes you could make, or if you should, if you could go back in time.

Douglas shouts several times, ""What the hell is going on here???"", expressing my own sentiment, and when a Japanese soldier on board seizes a weapon and shoots several of his people Douglas looks completely unfazed and bored.

416090,3,6302010306,"The Final Countdown is an alright movie.  It was made right around 1980, and is a combination of a military movie and a science fiction movie.  The military portion of the movie is quite impressive, featuring the fighter jets landing and taking off from the aircraft carrier.  The plot is somewhat thin; taking the carrier (and all its planes flying or landing) first back in time and then back to the present.  The carrier goes back to the time of Pearl Harbor where the planes have an encounter with Japanese war planes. The crux of the movie is the leaving behind of one of the characters from the present and finding him again at the end of the movie as an old man, some 40 years after he stayed behind. He (as an old man) is present when the carrier takes off, but the audience is unaware that he is the one in the limo that pulls up because of the darkened windows. He came to see the ship leave, and then he comes back at the end to see the ship return, where we finally see it is he (and his wife) who are in the car.  Kirk Douglas and Martin Sheen do a pretty good job here.  Martin looks a lot like his son Charlie at the time.  It would have been interesting to find out more about the phenomenon that brought them to the past and then back to the future, but that is not included in the movie.  This is not what you would call a stellar movie, but in terms of science fiction, it is okay.  And why the movie is called 'The Final Countdown' is unclear to me.",1489968000,,1469,4.144366197183099

This thing is great, the interplay between the characters is pretty good, Martin Sheen is just as annoying as I remember Lasky being... The ending has made me smile for almost 40 yrs, scary to realize it's been that long.

416163,4,6302010306,"I wrote a review on this one night, but I hit a key, I didn't mean to hit, and it wiped out this one and four other reviews.  So this is basically what I said.  One of the reasons I wanted this movie in SD because is it had Kirt Douglas in it.  Kirt Douglas is one of the last well-known actors who came from nothing and took on tough jobs just to make a few bucks, and took some chances that landed him in Hollywood.  I don't think he knew what he was doing was heading that way, but since it was he decided to stick around and see where all his efforts were going.  He was also Russian, something a lot of people don't really know about him.  I believe he was the first generation of his family from Russia, something his leading ladies used to talk about that is where he got his rugged good looks.  And this movie was one of his last movies before retirement.  Although it wasn't his last one, per se; that brings to a second reason for buying this movie.
The U.S. Navy wanted to show-off their latest toys: an advance aircraft carrier with their newest fighting machines the new A-4's called the Tom Cats.  And the Tom Cats had a brand new million dollar rocket to go with it the ""Phoenix missile"" no one knew they had at the time, and they chose to show it off in this movie, which brought quite a bit of criticism along with it.  While Russia always showed off their latest military might by marching down powerful avenues and filming them, similar to China -- to show the world just how powerful they really were; The United States military always seem to do it through Hollywood and that was what the critics were saying at the time.
At the time, back in those days, there was also a new theory scientists were going to released in public articles about a subject known only to them for years but were now all excited about and jumping around like a bunch of crazy kids, and talking all at once, because they think they had just solved another piece of what Einstein was talking about: the reality of real 'black holes"" in the universe. Although they didn't understand it completely Hollywood wanted to be one of the first to put their 2 cents in about it and how it might work.
Then there was a very young Martin Sheen.  Although most people today wouldn't recognize it but this movie had an all-star cast in it, and Martin Sheen stood out.  The reason he stood out was because he had taken on some of Hollywood's most controversial movies no one else would touch  such as (I can't think of it's correct spelling) the Vietnam War about the killing of a military officer gone bad; and Badlands, which also introduce us to a completely unknown actress Sissy Spiek. (Not sure I spelled her name right.)  He didn't mind doing those kinds of movies and taking risks, but behind the scene they said, he raised hell about being in this movie.  He wanted this movie very badly because it was going to be one of Kirt Douglas' last films and he wanted a chance to work with him.  Martin Sheen had a working theory back then that if he could work with some of the biggest and greatest film stars it would greatly enhance his ability later on.  I don't know how true it was but when you add all these reasons together it comes up to a better reason for wanting to see it.
I guess it all comes down to this: do you like movies? Really like movies?  The kind that takes you places you've never been and motivate you to go in other directions other than the same old boring places at home?  Then you'll like this one.  I only gave it a good rating but; hey, I very seldom any more give 5 stars to anyone.",1482796800,2,3599,4.272459499263623

416267,5,6302010306,Being an ex-Navy carrier sailor I really enjoyed this film.  The filming sequences of flight ops really brought back memories.  In fact the ship I was on had the VF-84 squadron aboard (although it was back in the days when they were flying F-4's).

416274,4,6302010306,"Finished watching this movie via Amazon video. 1st saw this movie way back in 1980s when it came out. Thought that it was a pretty awesome film back then, even though some of the special effects were lacking - but good enough. I like films about time travel, and this film measured up, even after all these years. As most other reviewers have stated, the American aircraft carrier U.S.S. NIMITZ is sucked through a time-portal and is transported back to the day before December 7, 1941 - the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

The Americans have to wrestled with the thoughts of changing history by attacking/destroying the Japanese attack fleet and its ramifications. Some very good questions arise: What would happen if Peal Harbor was forewarned?? What would happen if the NIMITZ destroyed the Japanese battle fleet??? What would happen if the NIMITZ suddenly sailed into an American port in 1941 and FDR was the president???

Also, some of my own questions: once the NIMITZ went back to its own time, would all those persons that were killed on the ship suddenly be alive??? If not, how would you explain their deaths, or would they have ever existed??? Also, how about the disappearance of the helicopter near the end of the movie - would it suddenly re-appear with live crew members??? Like one of the main characters stated in the movie - ""You could drive yourself crazy just thinking about this"" - or words to that affect.

Overall, still a good movie and its main theme. Hard to see this on TV anymore - my get lucky and see it on SyFy once in a great while. Am sure that all those modern day TV channels like Netflix and such would have this film. Anyway, still an awesome enough film.",1467504000,5,1694,4.64

The sound is weak with no use of surround. The original was recorded in Dolby Stereo, but this disk says it is 7.1, but its not in reality. It sounded like I was watching it on a TV instead of my 7.1 sound system. I was hoping for great use of the subwoofer channel and big sounds of the jet engines, but was very disappointed in this regard.

The plot is an interesting ""what if"" scenario of accidental time travel when the Nuclear Aircraft Carrier USS Nimitz passes through a strange storm and finds itself in the Pacific Ocean on December 6,1941. Several plot twists come to light leading up to the possibility of the Nimitz crew possibly stopping the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Consider modern aircraft, weapons, and jet engines in a ""turkey shoot"" against propeller driven Japanese Zeroes! It's a great movie, and for 99 cents, well worth the time to watch it again.",1449187200,3,702,4.858333333333333

416485,3,6302010306,"When you watch a movie, especially a science fiction version, there is an automatic process of suspension of belief.  How much suspension depends in some small part on the topic.  When we watch a Star Wars or Star Trek or Interstellar type of film, we know full well that it is entirely made up and almost completely unlikely or impossible for it to appear in real life, in any way.  Such is largely the premise that we take with this silly film.  An unaccountable freakish energy vortex (that is what it looks like) comes out of nowhere, on a cloudless day in the Pacific Ocean and it sends the (real) American Air Craft Carrier, USS Nimitz, through time, back to 1941, just a few  hours before the Japanese fleet lays waste the US fleet at Pearl Harbour.  Ok, that is the premise.  Like several time travel television shows or movies, this one is somewhat self conscious of the paradoxes that Einstein and his colleagues posed.  I refer to the problems inherent in visiting the past in ""your time line"".  Any interference in the smallest possible way would instantly change your history.  Some theorists posit that you would instantly branch off into a parallel universe to live out the remains of your life in a slightly or largely altered state, depending on what actions you took.  But, this is for theorists and is really not dealt with successfully in the film.  Or is it?

The plot, thin as it is, tempts the edges of the time travel paradox, but not in a certain way.  Blame that on the script.  The director does a fairly good job but is largely aided by all the eye-candy of the Nimitz and many of its flying wonders.  At first, I had not noticed that Kirk Douglas was in the film so when I saw him in the movie I was sure that he looked familiar but something was lacking.  Oh yes....that familiar Kirk facial contortion......I was let down by his performance here mostly because I am so used to seeing him over-act and strain his way through roles.  Instead of the usual 1000 watt performance, he maybe transfers 20 watts at best.  I think that this was a film that paid his bills and he knew it.  He is not given much to act with, the script being pretty lame.  I mean, given what had just happened to his state of the art nuclear powered monster ship, the best he can do is go from room to room and ask ""what is going on here""?  Duh, yeah.  We want to know too.

Martin Sheen does not shine in this film and seems to glide through; (sorry for the pun). There are plot holes that will make you laugh out loud.  Charles Durning, always a gem to watch, again has little material to deal with and ends up growling and cuffing his way through most scenes.  (Spoiler alert), when his gun goes off in the helicopter, it explodes the entire machine and it instantly disappears from the radar screen back on the Nimitz.  No explanation why or how.  He has to die in that time line and so, voila, he's gone.

(Spoiler alert)....when Sheen repeatedly reviews a book manuscript, the subject of which appears to be the unfolding action, we have no clear understanding of how this folds into the destiny of the author of the manuscript.  I don't think that this theme was well developed and it just hangs there without resolution.  What are we to make of it?  The guy had a premonition of his future fate? Doesn't make much sense.

And, just when you think that heroic Commander Douglas is about to single handedly knock out the entire Japanese Fleet, which in reality they could have done, our trusty time hole vortex comes back, gobbles up the ship, unexpectedly and unexplained...and all the jets that are out there....and whisks them back to the present day.  Time line intact, sort of.  Except for the dog.  THE DOG!  No explanation how a dog from 1941 could have been transported to the present day without changing history.  Just silly on top of silly.  And the final scene had so much promise and the script could have used this to much greater leverage......just fades away as the credits roll.

Honestly, thinking about it now, the film reminded me of the silly American television shows from the 60's, one of which was about time travel, the name escapes me right now.  Pretty lame by our standards in 2015 but I can see the promise of a medium quality accompaniment to a big bowl of buttered popcorn.  And, I didn't even mention the wink and a nod to the Philadelphia Experiment movie(s) that this movie has more than a passing family relationship to.  I expected better but it was at least not as seriously brain killing as ""Capricorn One"".",1447200000,,4554,4.5024390243902435

416735,5,6302010306,"I first saw TFC when it originally came out. Time travel, aviation, military all fantastic elements to make a movie I knew Id love. I remember being somewhat disappointed, however, probably because I think I had been expecting more of a Sci-Fi bent to it (slipping through a portal in time being merely the entrance coupon for the greater scenario) and more battle scenes and/or dog fights. All the same, it was a cool movie.

***potential spoilers ahead***

I was hoping that they would take actual battle to the Japanese task force and all that such an offensive entails (paradox be damned!), rather than the film evading that prospect altogether by means of the ship being dragged back through the portal to return to their present day. Loved the ending with the dog!

Over the years, I've caught bits & pieces of it on television whilst channel surfing, like you do... still thought it was a pretty good film.

I was recently given the Blu-Ray disc of it and I must say, I was blown away. I absolutely owe the movie an apology; it's not just a ""pretty good time travel movie,"" it's excellent. Perhaps it's the passage of years giving me a different perspective. Its clear to me now that within the limitations of the script and budget, they did a truly excellent job. I was watching on a 60 and the transfer seemed great.  The aerial photography is wonderful.

To my surprise, there were some Extras. Not easy to assemble for a film that was made thirty-five years ago. Theres a fantastic interview with the associate producer giving the inside scoop on the trials of making the film and an even better joint interview with six or so pilots from the Jolly Rogers who actually did the flying for the movie.  If you're into aviation, youll love these guys. Theyve long retired, but theyve still got the stuff. Loved it when they were cracking jokes about some of the lame moments in Top Gun.

As it happens, I know someone who was working on the Nimitz and was given a personal two-hour tour of the ship when it was last in San Diego during Fleet Week.  The ship is amazing. Kept thinking about the movie; I sat in the CAGs chair and could only think Kirk Douglas sat here!

416793,5,6302010306,"This was a TV movie -- a very good TV movie.  A lot better than many big-budget theatrical films.

The story is a good one.  What would happen if the nuclear war ship, the USS Enterprise, existed just before the sneak attack by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor?  Would history have been changed?

Kirk Douglas, Martin Sheen, James Farentino, Charles Durning, Ron O'Neal, Katherine Ross, and Soon-Tek Oh all give believable performances.  The film starts in the present day (when it was made) with Sheen boarding the Enterprise as an efficiency expert to observe and report his findings to his mysterious boss -- who sees him off from his limo -- Sheen has never met him, and doesn't meet him now.

The ship soon enters an area of very strange weather where the instruments all get goofy, a strange circular hole appears -- through which the Enterprise goes -- and a weird noise permeates the ship enough so that everyone covers their ears in pain.  The graphics are okay for the time in which the film was made -- and also because the producers were just about out of money by the time they needed to do the special effects -- so they did well under the circumstances.  But this isn't a ""special effects"" film, anyway.  It is story driven.

All the characters are from the present, except for the Japanese pilot, a US Senator and his aid, who are discovered after the Enterprise goes back in time to 1941.

Will the Enterprise prevent the attack on Pearl Harbor?  Will it do nothing so as not to change history?  Will it be stuck in 1941?  Did it really go back in time?  Is it all just an elaborate ruse -- perhaps by Sheen's boss to ""study"" what the crew will do?  Or have the Russians -- this starts out during the cold war -- somehow fool the Enterprise -- but for what purpose?

The story flows, the acting is good, the story is -- okay, maybe not ""plausible"" but it does ""track.""  It has a nifty ending.

This print -- the two-disc edition with the blue cover -- is excellent.  Do not watch other lesser-quality copies.  (At this writing, Amazon still lumps ALL reviews into one place -- no matter the source -- so beware inferior film prints.)

Watch this TV movie -- which really was too good for TV.",1431388800,,2204,4.455

Not especially for the hammy acting (that's why I didn't give it 5 stars), but for the enjoyable 'What If' premise of the film. Transport a fully armed modern nuclear carrier through time to Dec. 6, 1941? Ridiculous! Of course, Ridiculous, BUT, 'What If'? What would be the Captains reaction when he finally figured out what was really going on? Kirk Douglas played an appropriately confused Commanding Officer here, albeit somewhat heavy handed ham. The encounter between modern jet planes vs. Japanese Zeros was priceless (""Splash the Zeros""). Unfortunately, Time Paradoxes cannot be allowed, so we'll never know 'What If?'.

All in all, a fun movie and well recommended.",1431388800,2,759,4.9763779527559056

416977,4,6302010306,"Here's an interesting ""what if...?"" for you: ""What if"" you took a modern-day United States Navy aircraft carrier, complete with its 5,000-plus person crew and 100-plus jet fighters, and suddenly transported them all to another time in history? And ""what if"" that warship, with all its awesome firepower, turns up in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii on December 6, 1941 - the day before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor?

That's the premise of ""The Final Countdown,"" a 1980 science fiction film starring Kirk Douglas, Martin Sheen, James Farentino, Charles Durning, and Katharine Ross. Sound far-fetched? I remember thinking so the first time I watched it - on TV - many years ago. I also remember thinking at the time that the movie was actually pretty good.

I recently purchased a DVD copy of ""The Final Countdown"" because wanted to see if  it would still seem ""pretty good"" to me 30 years after I first watched it.

Our story opens in the year 1980. The aircraft carrier ""USS Nimitz,"" operating off the coast of Hawaii, is suddenly caught in a strange electrical vortex that transports the ship and its entire crew back in time to December 6, 1941 - the day before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Captain Yelland, the ship's commanding officer knows his history, and what that portends for the future. He and his crew face a terrible dilemma: should they take steps to stop the impending Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, thereby altering history... or, should they let historical events play themselves out, knowing full well what those events mean for the future?

After viewing ""The Final Countdown"" for the first time in 30 years, I still think it's a ""pretty good"" movie. It's well written and acted, has good solid production values, and is both thought-provoking and fun to watch.

No modern-day science fiction film should be without world-class special and visual effects. This is one area where ""The Final Countdown"" was a bit of a disappointment. The scenes showing the electrical vortex engulfing the ""USS Nimitz"" were definitely substandard, even by 1980 standards -  reflecting perhaps the movie's budgetary constraints. Certainly, three years after the release of the visually dazzling ""Star Wars,"" the production team for ""The Final Countdown"" should have made a stronger effort to make their film more visually appealing. Other special effects were somewhat better. Scenes of fighters taking off from the ""Nimitz's"" flight deck were excellent, and accurately showed what goes on during aircraft launch operations. The dogfight scenes between the F-14 fighters and Japanese Zeroes were also noteworthy.

Three decades ago, I first watched ""The Final Countdown"" and thought it was a ""pretty good"" movie. That was at a time when hi-tech special effects were in their infancy, and only a very few science fiction/fantasy films were being produced. Now, even with stunning special effects the norm and a plethora of science fiction/fantasy films being released every year, ""The Final Countdown"" manages to hold its own. It's still a ""pretty good"" movie. Enjoy!",1424304000,8,3079,5.095238095238095

416980,5,6302010306,"WOW! I remember seeing this movie for the first time on Cable TV back in early 1981 or 82. It stuck with me as one of my faves throughout the decade. Not only was I intrigued by it's time warp idea about an aircraft carrier going back in time, but to Pearl Harbor in late Dec. 1941?! Are you kidding me? lol I was glued to the screen the whole time! Kirk Douglas (Spartacus, The War Wagon) leads an all star cast as the Ship's Commander of the USS Nimitz. While on patrol with it's destroyer's, it encounters a strange electric storm that is heading right for them. Douglas not knowing what it will do to the fleet, sends signals back to the destroyer's crews to head back as soon as possible. What happens next is a military veterans dream, or is it? To head back in time with a well armed nuclear aircraft carrier and stop a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, thus saving over 2,000 lives in the process. If you love War movies and the possibility of time altering aftermaths of an event like this, you are going to love THE FINAL COUNTDOWN.
The movie has aged well and the actors, they are just as good today in 2015 as they were in 1980. BLUE UNDERGROUND has done a fantastic job of putting this movie out for all of us fans to enjoy for years to come. This DVD is THX certified, DTS and 5.1 Sound, Widescreen 16x9 enhanced, nice menus with music. The packaging is good with reversible cover and chapter selections in white lettering, easy to read.

The ubiquitous story of a modern aircraft carrier stationed around Pearl Harbor which manages to take a trip back into time and then return.  Along the way a pilot disappears.  While the plot is a real stretch of reality, the scenes of modern jet fighters flying along side WWII era fighter planes are pretty neat.  If you can find a way to accept the story, the movie is a great way to pass a couple of enjoyable hours.

I spent 8 yrs in the military during the cold war and Vietnam and have had lots of friends say the Carrier scenes are very realistic to the point that they could see themselves ""serving"" again.

417169,4,6302010306,"Kirk Douglas makes this movie as the skipper of the USS Nimitz in this, ""What If?""  The Nimitz goes through a horrific storm, the likes no one has ever experienced.  They are sent through a time warp to December 6, 1941 and day before the Day of Infany.  If you like action scenes, then you'll cheer the two F-14 Tomcats in a one sided fiasco with their outclassed Mitubishi Zeroes.  After it becomes apparent that they are really back in December, 1941 and that the attack will take place, Captain Yelland (Douglas) has to decide whether to try to thwart the Japanese attack or let history take it's course.  On board are some of Hollywood's finist stars, including Martin Sheen as a civilian analyst from the Pentagon who gives Douglas more headaches than he needs, Charles Durning as Senator Samual Chapman, Katharine Ross as Chapman's administrative assistant, James Farentino as the CAG, and MASH guest star Soon-Tek Oh who is the lone Japanese pilot who overtakes a Marine guard, takes his M-16 and threatens Laurel Scott (Ross) unless the ship gives him a radio to warn the Japanese Fleet waiting to attack.

I'm afraid to say anything more for those who have yet to see this movie.  In some ways, it's hokey, but  good clean fun.  I can't beileve a Marine would lax his guard so that a dangerous opponent would overtake him with his own weapon.  I bet the Marines liked that, but what do you expect from a Navy film.

There is really no way to make a bad movie if it involves air craft carriers and bad A jets from the 70's and 80's launching while burning about 5000 lbs of fuel per second.

417422,5,6302010306,"Most of you know the story of the aircraft carrier Nimitz, caught in a storm and transported back in time to December 6, 1941, the day before Pearl Harbor is attacked.
When they find out where they are, all sorts of precautions are put into place by the Captain (Kirk Douglas) to preserve the timeline until the inevitable happens and he is forced to take action against two Jap Zeros heading right for the Nimitz with the deck full of armed planes, it is one of the highlights of the film...two antique Japanese Zeros against two modern Nuclear powered F-14 Tomcats, the Zeros are pathetically outmatched, and subsequently dispatched with effortless ease, unfortunately, one of the pilots survives and creates a bit of a problem......what to do with him.
Well the plot thickens so I won't ruin it for those who may not have seen this awesome movie.
This is the film that got me interested in time travel, I first saw this film on HBO In 1981 and watched it every time they showed it, I thought it was the best movie I ever saw to that point....I lost count at how many times I've seen it after about 50. If you haven't seen this movie, you MUST!

417424,3,6302010306,"Spoiler alert:  I thought the concept of the movie was pretty neat until I realized that the whole time-travel experience netted no new result.  Why did the second electrical storm come right before the history-altering attack was to occur?  Is the message simply that if we ever do find a way to travel back in time, somehow nature will find a way to make it insignificant, so that we can't really alter the future by going back in time?",1399680000,,438,4.518987341772152

417426,3,6302010306,"The Final Countdown (Don Taylor, 1980)

One of the only reasons anyone remembers that this movie exists is the ridiculous hair-metal song Europe wrote (very) loosely based on it five years later. (And now you will have that keyboard line in your head the rest of the day. You're welcome.) The film is just as ridiculous as the song, but I can't deny it's a guilty pleasure, one of the things you keep around to watch when nothing else sounds good and you're in the mood for something familiar where you can simply turn your brain off. Few movies fit the bill as well as The Final Countdown. And now, with that cheesy keyboard riff playing in your head...

Plot: A state-of-the-art aircraft carrier, bankrolled by a mysterious millionaire named Tideman, is out for its initial maneuvers when it runs into a storm unlike anything any of its seasoned crew have ever seen. The new boat weathers it well enough, but when they emerge, they find themselves nowhere near where they startedin fact, they are afloat off Pearl Harbor in the early days of December, 1941. The boat's captain, Matthew Yelland (the mighty Kirk Douglas), and his crew have the opportunity to change the course of history with, as it were, insider information. While no one landside is quite sure what to make of this massive structure, things on the boat reach a tipping point when the boys capture themselves a Japanese recon pilot, Simura (Mulan's Soon-tek Oh). With some of the crew arguing to intercept the coming force, some arguing against it, and a few dropping hints that they should make it look as if the information came naturally from the interrogation of Simura, things are bound to come to a headand sooner rather than later.

What amazes me about cheesy movies like this is the incredible starpower they were capable of attracting in the pre-DTV days. Kirk Douglas is just the tip of this particular iceberg; Martin Sheen plays his second in command; others on the boat are played by Katharine Ross, James Farentino, Lloyd Kaufman (in his final role before founding Troma), and Ron O'Neal, all towards the top of the seventies B-list, while Charles Durning plays a Senator who's out for a cruise while the action is taking place. That's a lot of talent on one screen, and all of it put to...this. The talent therein is what saves it from mediocrity and makes it the watchable artifact of the unbearably cheesy theatrical releases that it is. Still, if you have a low tolerance for scripts that lay it on thick, you might want to avoid this one. I guess there's no one to blame, but you're still leaving ground. ***",1399248000,,2597,4.7032967032967035

417442,4,6302010306,"Pretty generic plot line, familiar to sci-fi fans. Modern-day people (circa 1980) sent back in time following an inexplicable encounter with a supernatural force. Nothing ground-breaking there. The writer and director did a pretty good job of taking an old story and adding unique elements to make this interesting. Aside from ""The Philadelphia Experiment"", I don't recall any other movie about a large naval vessel going back in time. In this case, it's a nuclear aircraft carrier out of Pearl Harbor. Beginning to see where this is going?

Fast forward to the past - a massive echo of ""something"" appears on the the ship's radar. The skipper tries to outrun it and outflank it, but this sucker just keeps coming at him. Soon, the ship is engulfed in some kind of dark, swirling vortex-thingie. High-intensity sound effects render the crew helpless, of course. What happens next?

Sorry - no spoilers. I will say that it's not the plot that makes this flick enjoyable, it's the characters.

If you're looking for historical accuracy, scientific insight, or good guy-bad guy shootouts, don't bother. This is none of the above. Enjoyment depends upon whether or not you suspend disbelief. Good acting makes that possible, even when the story isn't that fresh.",1398297600,,1258,5.038461538461538

417444,4,6302010306,"I'll start and preface this review by saying I was stationed onboard USS Nimitz (CVN 68) some months after the release of the movie.  It was a movie shown WEEKLY onboard that ship.  Given that, I'm honestly tired of the movie and have avoided seeing it for years.

Final Countdown was a great ""What If"" movie.  World War II is imminent and somehow, through this magnetic storm, this 20th Century warship is transported back to the 1940s just in time for the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Onboard Nimitz were several squadrons of F-14 Tomcats, the state of the art fighter aircraft of the time, and still one of the coolest looking birds ever designed.  Forgot what you saw on Officer and A Gentlemen, these guys were there for REAL war.

Final Countdown will provide some thrills.  The aerial combat scenes are some of the best.  The ""ride along"" in the Tomcats is unforgettable, especially launch and recovery.

It IS Hollywood.  If you were in the Navy you could spend hours and hours picking it apart.  If that's what you plan on doing, don't bother, you won't enjoy the movie.",1397692800,2,1075,4.62962962962963

Everything from RA-5 ""Viggies"" to E-2 Hawkeyes & C-2 ""COD"" planes, to A-7E Corsair II's to F-14 Tomcats to S-3 Vikings to Sea King Helicopters - just about everything represented by US Naval Aviation in the early 1980's was here! So the plot of the film not withstanding (Sorry, but I'm not ""into"" time-travel type films), it was refreshing to see the real planes as they actually were - not represented by F-5's playing the role of ""MiG's"", etc. All-in-all, a very entertaining film and for the planes themselves, well worth the price of the DVD! Many of these planes (F-14's, S-3 Vikings, A-7 Corsair II's, etc; have been permanently retired and will likely never to be seen again, except in museums and perhaps with the occasional wealthy war-bird owner flying a restored aircraft at air shows, etc. All things considered, a ""5-star"" film!",1397260800,2,1014,4.702247191011236

I like the F-14's (jets), about the only fun part of the film. The Japanese pilot who is captured is the same guy who shows up in several other movies. This detracts from the realism. Or maybe the producers didn't care about realism. I give it 3 stars in honor of the crew U.S.S. Nimitz, who played themselves.

I did watch the movie a second time, because I build F-14 models. The carrier is amazing. Interviews with the pilots (features) were good. And comments by those who made this film added a lot.

Having spent some time on the USS Nimitz I am fully aware of the massive amount of weaponry that this great warship carries and the ability of everyone that serves aboard her.  You just cannot imagine a more spectacular site than standing on the dock at Pearl and looking straight up and still not being able to see everything but ship.

417635,5,6302010306,"OK - There's this giant, green, swirling storm, see, and it swallows up an entire modern US Navy aircraft carrier in 1981 and sticks it back into December of 1941. If that premise doesn't work for you, stop reading right now, don't buy this DVD, and get back to something truly dopey, like the X-Men.

But if you want a realistic, believable action yarn about what might really happen, and what the officers and men of a modern carrier would do on 06 December 1941 had they been there, you'll love this one!

I'm a retired United States Naval Aviator of the decade just before this, and I can assure you the shipboard, carrier air ops, and flying scenes are realistic and accurately portrayed, if somewhat compressed in time. Unlike turkeys like ""Top Gun"", which was idiotic from start to finish, The Final Countdown looks and feels right. The characters do and say what real Naval Aviators would do and say, and special recognition should go to the Japanese actor who plays a 1941 pilot who is shot down, rescued, and brought aboard the 1981 ship. His amazement and disbelief is palpable.

You may or may not see the ending coming, but it is satisfying and believable, given the original premise.

This is a great movie, superbly scripted, directed, shot, and staged aboard a real aircraft carrier with real flying scenes and real airplanes. The characters are right and believable, and there's even a cool dog.

While the goings on aboard a modern aircraft carrier was interesting throughout, the actors hearts just weren't in it.  The stars certainly bring top resumes to this film, but the director let them all ""phone it in"" so too speak.  The special effects surrounding the time displacement were ok.  The handling of all the potential ""cause and affect"" dilemmas brought on by the situation facing the crew were barely explored or handled quite shallowly.  The basic question of whether the Nimitz should or shouldn't intervene in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor is barely debated by the principles here!  A captured Jap airman handles an M-16 like a pro, despite never having seen the weapon before.  He also appears rather blas about all the advanced technology surrounding him!  All in all, the story is ok and is interesting to a point.  But this could have been soooo much better.  The ending is also too pat and a cop out which side steps all the issues at stake to wrap things up.  If you keep expectations down some, its a fair story to take in.",1379808000,,1214,4.590697674418605

Should it use its powerful modern planes to stop the Japs? The film seems to be suggest that one 1980 carrier could wipe out the whole Japanese navy of 1941. The acting is wooden and pretty awful by Kirk Douglas and Martin Sheen, not to mention the minor actors. The dialogue is silly, and the soundtrack is hokey.

This movie deserves more than DVD and I'm glad it's available on Blu-ray.  The film shows its age (1980) and the special effects are a little hoaky against modern computer graphics, but they hold up well enough to support the story.

The premise is simple: the USS Nimitz (CVN-68) is drawn back in time to December 6, 1941 and has the opportunity to change history by destroying the Japanese fleet before it can attack Pearl Harbor. (I won't say whether they do this, so as not to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it yet!) The blu-ray is excellent. The producers were given extensive access to the ship, crew (serving as extras) and aircraft. This meant that some of the interiors were shot in such cramped circumstances that the camera had a very narrow depth of field with the result that the actors move in and out of focus - which I found a distraction. The ""storm"" is a little icky as a special effect. The flying sequences are pin-sharp, and all the aircraft carry the appropriate weaponry. The real star of the movie is, of course, the ship.",1374278400,,868,4.535031847133758

Example: The CAG office- when Martin Sheen's character is snooping around the desk, the chairs and items on the desk are -what appears to be- out of focus, when in fact it is the digital enhancement around the center of focus that ""distorts"" the original film. Basically you can ""see"" where the digital enhancement is ""active"". The dogfights and outside aerials are amazing as if you are there! Couldn't have been better and made watching this original tale as if it was the first time watching it! Kirk Douglas never looked better! Absolutely vivid!

They had to set up and tear down in relative short time frames to accommodate the navy's use of the bridge and other areas of the ship.  During the actual filming, day to day operations of the, take off and landing procedures were a vital aspect of the film; trying to plan a plot into the film.

It was interesting how far the Navy had come during the gap between those two films in terms of real support for films like this.  They made it pretty tough on the producers for Final Countdown, but went all out for Top Gun--realizing (under Navy Secretary John Lehman) how valuable films like this could be for recruiting.

I do think Final Countdown suffers a little in comparison because of the limited amount of F-14 work the Navy provided the film, but I have to say . . . I was lucky enough to watch a screening in the Enterprise's ""Dirty Shirt"" wardroom for the pilots . . . and Kirk Douglas' line where he finally decides he has to do something about the Japanese Zeros going after Charles Durning's yacht ""Spash the Zeros!"" had every pilot in the room hollering and yelling like a bunch of drunken frat brothers!  Followed by both Tomcats rotating their variable wings to supersonic position and lighting afterburners . . . no question every pilot in the room was ready to take down the entire Japanese Pearl Harbor invasion force singlehandedly.",1372896000,,1311,4.637931034482759

 What makes this film truly remarkable is the Air Wing of the ship.. It was filmed at the introduction of the F-14 Tomcat fighter...

Great cast in their acting prime keeps you riveted even if the plot goes astray for a few minutes.

Some of the acting is painfully wooden - in a typically 70s style, but the script and storyline more than make up for it. A dramatically one-sided dogfight between two F-14 Tomcats and two Japanese Zeros is probably the greatest air battle scene ever filmed, for both its cinematography and dark comic flavor.",1363219200,,470,4.674698795180723

I expected it to be kind of lame, in the sci-fi movie sort of way, a cheesy line or plot twist here and there, but the description is misleading.
(Description)
What if a 1980's American aircraft carrier (with its modern firepower) time-warped back to Pacific waters near Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941?
(end)

So, you'd expect some pretty awesome fighter jets swooping in and ripping Zeros out of the sky, throwing missiles here and there, but NO. Not at all.

SEVERE LACK of fighting. 1 fight scene for the jets, 1 fight scene for the seamen on the ship. Nothing like one might expect.

THE FINAL COUNTDOWN (1981) is an imaginative time travel story that stars Kirk Douglas, Martin Sheen, James Farentino, Katherine Ross and Charles Durning. It's set on the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Nimitz, currently cruising some distance from Hawaii.

When the Nimitz is engulfed in a strange electrical storm, all aboard are transported back in time to December 6th, 1941. Once it's realized that the Japanese fleet is not far away and steaming toward their sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, a whole realm of possibilities open up, that is, whether or not the modern arsenal of the Nimitz should be used to destroy the enemy's entire armada before a single plane is launched.

The possibility of altering history is discussed, but one issue that's not made clear is that that the U.S. might not enter WWII when it did (on December 8th), and although the Japanese would no longer be a factor in the Pacific if their fleet was obliterated, what would become of an as-yet undecided war in Europe without America's presence there?

Despite this unanswered question, I really enjoyed ""Final Countdown"" and do recommend it.",1357171200,2,2197,8.838565022421525

417966,4,6302010306,"I have no idea what this movie cost to make in 1980, I'm sure that the producers spent more on Kirk Douglas, Martin Sheen and James Farentino's salaries (probably more for any one of them) than they did on special effects but this movie actually holds together very well for a great story.
There have been many books, short stories, TV episodes, even other movies about what it would be like to have the opportunity to actually go back and rewrite history- this one tells the story of the USS Nimitz getting caught in a weird storm and discovering they're now in December 6 1941. They rescue a couple of Americans-  one of which they find went ""missing"" according to history, and capture a Japanese pilot after shooting his plane down for attacking the Senator's yacht.
There's a lot of discussion about what to do, arguments both ways, finally the decision is made to join in on the attack. Within sight of the Japanese fleet that storm is seen again and the Captain decides they shouldn't intervene. He orders everyone to return to ship and go home unknowingly leaving Farentino's and the Senator's aide behind on a deserted island ( the Senator and aide had been flown there for safety and the Senator, demanding to go to Pearl Harbor, accidentally causes the destruction of the helicopter).
The Nimitz returns ""home"", and in the biggest plot problem of the movie the crew doesn't appear to tell anyone what happened to them (nothing further mentioned of their casualties, missing helicopter, missing men or the now dead Japanese pilot..
Leaving the ship Sheen's character again notices the limousine of the man behind the Nimitz development, he and the dog (belonging to the Senator's aide) soon learn that his mysterious benefactor is in fact Farentino who went on to make a life with Katherine Ross ( what's she doing these days?), the aide.

With so many movies being remade these days I think this one would be a good candidate for an update. The Navy would probably be just as willing to cooperate (this one made them look good- filming on board a real carrier, using a real crew),update the effects fix a plot hole or two- it could work I think.",1354579200,7,2155,4.698412698412699

In addition to the intrigue, it's always great to see a lot of fast flying jets, and the matchup of F15's and Japanese Zero's....

  The very idea of something like that actually happening is mind blowing.
  I think the chemistry between Martin Sheen and Kirk Douglas was fantastic. There are some areas which I thnk should have been researched better. A task force is usually commanded a an admiral. In the big ending scene when the Nimitz moves to stop the japanese, What are those bombers doing there?

417970,4,6302010306,"Of all the genres of Science Fiction time travel is the most difficult to write and film. There are so many paradoxes in the story line.  For example what happens if you go back in time and accidently kill a relative, which means you shouldn't even exist to commit the act?

The Final Countdown has so many of these plot holes inconsistencies you could drive a truck through them! At least, the character tries to discuss these issues during the film. The basic premise is that a strange magnetic storm looking likes a spiral of clouds throws the aircraft carrier into a time portal. The modern aircraft carrier is transported the day before Pearl Harbor. It is not the science in this film that is most interesting, but the possibilities the film poses, pitting a modern aircraft carrier against the comparatively primitive Japanese fleet. Kirk Douglas plays the Captain and the ever reliable Martin Sheen plays an advisor from the Navy that many think is behind this bizarre incident. It is interesting to speculate the effect a modern aircraft carrier would have in World War 2.

While patrolling the skies two supersonic Tomcats come across two Japanese Zeros that strafe a yacht. The aerial work between the Tomcats and the Zeros is excellent and illustrates what a mismatch it is. The Zeros are destroyed and one pilot is rescued.

The crew decides no matter what time they are, the US fleet at Pearl Harbor must be protected. Just as the plane launch the strange storm ""conveniently"" appears again and the fleet is sent back to the present time.

This film looks like it would probably be enjoyed by aviation enthusiast more than science fiction fans. The elaborate camera work of jets fighters landing and taking off is impressive. This being a vintage 1980 film many aircraft here are out of service and can been seen here in all their glory. In short, this is a science fiction film with both action and adventure.",1353369600,2,1924,4.7657657657657655

It still had me on the edge of my seat(couch). The whole idea of traveling back in time through a ""worm hole"" is very interesting and seeing the modern F-15's(?) playing around with the Japanese ""Zero"" from the 1940's was a nice touch. I think it was good that the ""worm hole"" appeared again and they didn't have the chance to challenge the entire Japanese fleet with one carrier. Yes, it was a modern version, but still.

Germany won the war when the Allies surrendered after the Luftwaffe dropped the 'A' Bomb on New York and Los Angeles, and there was a Cold War going on between the USSR and The German European Republic.

418135,4,6302010306,"SOME SPOILERS

It's always great to see an old stalwart in a good role, and in THE FINAL COUNTDOWN, Kirk Douglas, the valedictorian of the Clenched Jaw School of Acting, gives us a star turn as the Captain of the then brand new supercarrier USS NIMITZ.

THE FINAL COUNTDOWN is practically a recruiting poster for the US Navy. We get to see, close up, the myriad of jobs that sailors are tasked with on board ship. Made just before TOP GUN, THE FINAL COUNTDOWN has none of the music video quality of that Tom Cruise film. Instead, it harks back to the old low-budget morale boosters made during the Second World War.

And quite appropriately, as it turns out, because the NIMITZ passes through some kind of unexplained time warp or worm hole, and finds itself sailing the South Pacific on December 6, 1941, just twenty four hours before the attack on Pearl Harbor.

At first befuddled and thinking this is some kind of elaborate war game for the new ship and crew, Douglas (who plays the mellow Captain Yelland) and his officers (including Martin Sheen as Lasky, a journalist sent to write about the NIMITZ) have trouble accepting that Jack Benny is on the radio and that the BBC is covering the Siege of Leningrad. Douglas wisely keeps his alert fighters in the air however, and they eventually engage and destroy a couple of Japanese Zeros that are attacking a civilian yacht flying US colors.

Although the yacht is sunk, the NIMITZ rescues a hawkish US Senator and his pretty secretary and her dog, played respectively by Charles Durning, Katharine Ross, and ""Charlie."" Durning is the Chairman of the Senate Arms Committee; and the NIMITZ has altered history by saving his life. The Senator, tapped as Roosevelt's 1944 running mate, will become the President upon FDR's death.

Durning easily has the worst role in the film. He spends most of the movie being ridiculously bellicose and demanding. He's furious that the Navy has secretly been building ""rocket planes"" without clearing it through Committee, regardless of the fact that his life has been saved by those same rocket planes. Properly, he should be drop-jawed and filled with pride at the size of the NIMITZ and its advanced technology, but he's even angrier that the ship is named for a serving officer. All he wants to do is get back to Pearl and get to the bottom of this mystery.

For his part, Douglas is accommodating, though he tries mightily to keep Durning in the dark about the whys and wherefores of the NIMITZ's unexplainable appearance. Eventually, it is revealed that the attack on Pearl Harbor is known to be imminent, and Durning insists that Pearl be advised. Douglas agrees to fly him back to Pearl Harbor in a helicopter, which, luckily for history, suffers an accident, killing the Senator and stranding Durning's secretary and Douglas' XO (James Farentino) on a remote, uninhabited Hawaiian island. They also become stranded in time as the NIMITZ is pulled back through the time vortex just as its planes are about to engage the Japanese.

THE FINAL COUNTDOWN has some internal logical flaws and a few loose ends in its storyline, but overall the film plays very well. The special effects seem simplistic compared to today's CGI. The NIMITZ itself (before any of its subsequent updating refits) now seems more closely related to the World War II-era ENTERPRISE and HORNET than did it when the film came out, a sure sign of how far our technology has advanced in the past thirty years. This is a film that is very entertaining. It could easily stand a current remake.

It is a fascinating ""What if"" to consider that the NIMITZ alone could have ended the Pacific War before it began by easily routing the Japanese air attack AND more than likely singlehandedly destroying Kota Baru, the Japanese task force, and its carriers.",1329782400,2,3808,4.7926829268292686

418192,3,6302010306,"As the U.S.S. Nimitz prepares to leave out to sea, she is boarded by Warren Lasky (Martin Sheen) a systems analyst sent to observe and make recommendations to his boss, Richard Tideman, the designer and builder of the Nimitz and a man Lasky has never actually met. While going through routine maneuvers at sea, the ship is sucked into an unknown phenomenon that turns out to be a temporal whirlpool. They discover that they've been sent back through time to Dec. 6, 1944 and Capt. Matthew Yelland (Kirk Douglas) and his commanding officers must make a decision: do they try to stay out of the way or do they use the full extent of the firepower of the aircraft carrier and destroy the Japanese airforce and navy before they are able to attack Pearl Harbor?

THE FINAL COUNTDOWN isn't the greatest movie about time travel. It doesn't have the greatest dialogue and there are events that happen that just don't make sense with the rest of the movie (such as the dog running away from her owner: it only provides a way for the Japanese prisoner to try to escape). Also, the movie has an anticlimactic finale: the Nimitz and her crew decide to go to war, but the battle never happens.

Yet, despite all of this THE FINAL COUNTDOWN is an enjoyable movie to watch; it's a good Saturday afternoon or rainy day movie. Perhaps it's because of the realism involved in the film. For anyone who has any interest in the navy or navy vehicles or military aircraft, THE FINAL COUNTDOWN is a must see film. The movie was made in 1980 when there was no CGI. All of the vehicles used in the movie are real. The aircraft carrier is real, the jets are real, the helicopter is real, etc. Not only that, but almost all of the extras and non-major characters are played by real service personnel. It's truly amazing to watch because I can't recall any other film that wasn't propaganda or a documentary that features the navy in such a close-up and positive view. It is this part of the movie the makes THE FINAL COUNTDOWN a movie that every film buff should see at least once.

Overall, THE FINAL COUNTDOWN is a fairly enjoyable sci-fi movie that raises some interesting time travel questions. There's not a whole lot of action, but the most impressive part of the film is watching the real military personnel and their vehicles perform on screen.",1319932800,2,2325,4.570743405275779

They shot the scenes where he addressed the crew in the TV Studio I worked in so I spent a few days with them.  I get to say ""Attention on Deck"" when Kirk walks out his his first staff meeting.  They spelled my name wrong in the credits but it was still a great experience.

It's easy to say, ""what if"", more difficult to follow through and present the repercussions of your theory.  I would rather have seen a more complete story, but I can only deal with what they came up with; there's still enough potential here to satisfy.
Kirk Douglas, James Farentino, and Katharine Ross are quite good in their roles.  Charles Durning was a bit off but I put that down to the writing that made his senator more thug than politician (or maybe it's the same thing?).

OK acting, OK plot, but the ship and crew are the stars, some great sea going shots for you sailors...

no smut, or too graphic violence, but would not suggest 10 or under, there is some battle shots...

THE FINAL COUNTDOWN (1981) is an imaginative time travel story that stars Kirk Douglas, Martin Sheen, James Farentino, Katherine Ross and Charles Durning. It's set on the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Nimitz, currently cruising some distance from Hawaii.

When the Nimitz is engulfed in a strange electrical storm, all aboard are transported back in time to December 6th, 1941. Once it's realized that the Japanese fleet is not far away and steaming toward their sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, a whole realm of possibilities open up, that is, whether or not the modern arsenal of the Nimitz should be used to destroy the enemy's entire armada before a single plane is launched.

The possibility of altering history is discussed, but one issue that's not made clear is that that the U.S. might not enter WWII when it did (on December 8th), and although the Japanese would no longer be a factor in the Pacific if their fleet was obliterated, what would become of an as-yet undecided war in Europe without America's presence there?

Despite this unanswered question, I really enjoyed ""Final Countdown"" and do recommend it.",1297036800,2,2189,8.802690582959642

In addition, the interior shots during the ship's medical department scenes show a poor quality. The center of the screen is HD but the outer edges (a good portion not just a tiny section) is totally out of focus for the entire scenes of the Japanese prisoner taking a hostage and killing crew members.

Unfortunately, I was rather somewhat disappointed in the Bluray edition. It is not ""THX"" certified, and it shows. It's ok, but it's not that much of an improvement over the standard (when viewed 'upconverted')version .  There are some scenes where the image is less than good.  Granted, there are many scenes where the image quality is good, with lots of fine detail, but those offset by the less-than-stellar scenes.  (For clarification, I use a Panasonic BD60 player connected to a 42"" Panasonic U700, and I sit about 3' from the screen)

IMHO, the ""THX"" certifeid standard DVD is amost as good as the Bluray. Blue Underground did a fantastic job when they made the standard DVD; I can't begin to imagine why they released such a meager upgrade in the Bluray. It is acceptable, but hardly demo-worthy. I hope they redo it and rerelease it in a ""THX"" Bluray version.

Bottom line: fantastic movie, you'll love it in whichever version you get.",1276041600,7,1165,4.594202898550725

This movie had a lot of great action but a great story. The Entire Movie was filmed on board the real U.S.S Nimitz using a lot of her real crew and real Fighter Squardren. The Only Special effects you will see is of the Storm that takes the Nimitz back in time and then forwrd.

The premise is very cool; modern day aircraft carrier goes back in time to WWII, immediately prior to the Pearl Harbor attack. One can imagine the sorts of problems that arise having a nuclear aircraft carrier, and modern fighters in 1941. The movie attempts to sell the ethical dilemma, does the ship intervene on behalf of America, or simply let Pearl Harbor be attacked.

Unfortunately the movie doesn't really follow through in terms of story, writing and acting. The special effects are about on par with what one could expect from the 1980's.

Kirk Douglas, Sheen, Katharine Ross, and Durning have nothing to work with (and all the acting is strained and awkward in this film, making you wonder why they ever took up this project in the first place) and the attitudes and jokes at the end are completely irreverent. Would the captain and crew really be cracking jokes after having to weigh such a huge decision on whether or not to prevent the deaths of thousands at Pearl Harbor and thus changing history? (Which also makes the ending a foregone conclusion.) No exploration of the time warp or black hole or vortex or whatever it was that sucked them back to 1941 is given (limiting the whole sci-fi aspect of this movie), and really most of the movie is spent watching the crew wandering around confused wondering things like ""what's going on around here?"" Frustrating and slow as molasses, the worst part of it is that the makers of this film had the opportunity to make it about a tribute to our servicemen and women and Pearl Harbor, but instead decided to skip that completely and turn it into something else. Possibly a tribute to the F-14 and the Navy? Maybe, but that still barely makes the film watchable as a whole, and the inexplicable comic attitudes at the end of the film actually work to diminish the history of Pearl Harbor and WWII, which is where the real failure of the movie lies, also because perhaps the makers of this film did not intend for that to happen. If you want to see the amazing F-14 Tomcat in action, USS Nimitz, and Arizona memorial footage, this movie works to showcase that, which is all this movie really has going for it. It is also interesting to note that the DVD commentary by the director of photography yields some very interesting information about their experience with the Navy and what an amazing and life-changing experience it was for them to be on the Nimitz for 8 days of filming.",1262217600,2,1958,4.581196581196581

The movie was made in the late seventies when the ""Russian Bear"" was still the enemy and our newest Supercarriers, and the unbelievable F14-Tomcat fighters were deployed. The begining of the movie is kind of like the older Pro-Military technology docudramas, but develops quickly into its main story. The USS Nimitz while on a routine patrol from modern Pearl Harbor encounters a freak storm and is transported back in time to the day before the Dec 7, 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The clash of technologies that takes place is exciting and for a minute you forget its just a science fiction movie.

418476,4,6302010306,"Although viewers may realize at the onset that this film is bound to be anticlimactic, the writers figured out a way to still make it worthwhile. This they did by adding a kick at the end. As for the execution of the story itself, one is bound to be more critical if one has seen the film a hundred times, as I have. But it's only the small things. And the more one watches it, the more self serving the film is as a showcase for the power and prestige of the U.S. Navy, at a time when the U.S. was at the peak of its power. Clearly the Navy had a great deal to gain by cooperating on this film, yet it vanished for years after being initially released on all the now-ancient disk formats. When VHS and then, DVD, became wildly popular, the film was nowhere to be seen, the result of some dispute that lasted for years.

The DVD version lacked the crispness I expected and I haven't read any reviews on the Blu-Ray release. Still, the movie is a good time travel yarn that actually plays by the rules when it comes to the usual paradoxes. At some places, the production looks rushed. As the two Japanese Zeros break formation at the appearance of the Navy jets, it looks contrived. So do the repeated shots of the pilots as they gape at the new technology. Although it's difficult to predict how real Japanese pilots would have reacted, it's highly doubtful they would have remained on course. Most likely they would have headed back with their new intelligence. That, however, would have deprived the audience of seeing the F-14s of ""splashing the Zeros."" (After all, you can't rob the audience of a confrontation, entirely.)

There's also the typical Hollywood treatment of blood, or the lack thereof. One man is strafed by machine gun fire in the water, yet there's no blood at all. And when the Japanese airman escapes on board the aircraft carrier (unlikely), he leaves bright red blood all over the place. It's the wrong color, the wrong consistency and, in fact, looks like paint. The strafing was okay if you're filming a GET SMART episode, but it was sloppy. And at times it just screamed RECRUITMENT. Still, as I said, these are small but irritating tidbits noticed by watching the movie too many times. The fact that I, and many others, have watched it that often speaks well of its creativity.",1250035200,3,2305,4.525179856115108

How would modern day military men with high tech weapons, given an unexpected and unique opportunity to do so, deal with a decision to change the course of history? It is a good story from start to finish. The star talent is pretty impressive, with greats such as Charles Durning, Martin Sheen and of course the great Kirk Douglas. Of note are the scenes that pit a Zero fighter against an F-14. The outcome may be predictable of course, but one can imagine the utmost surprise at a Japanese pilot of the era being buzzed by such an aircraft! You can feel the exhilaration in seeing some payback meted out after the zeros do something that was dastardly yet not really uncommon of them to do then. Some reviewers may knock the movie and comlpain about the outcome, but they miss the point altogether. This is good entertainment and worth the 'time'.",1247270400,2,970,4.548571428571429

There is no sequel to Final Countdown. But did you like this movie and want more? A common frustrating sentiment with some movies. Consider reading Birmingham's Weapons of Choice trilogy.

BUT, the sound quality is Terrible and I tried playing the movie in DTS 7.1, Dolby 7.1 True HD and Dolby 5.1 EX modes all sounding the same. There was barely enough low frequency to kick my Klipsch Sub on from its stand-by mode and that was while driving my amp at 150% of the volume I typically watch my DVDs. I mean, compared to the Blu-Ray version of Top Gun (BTW highly recommended) this Blu-Ray version of The Final Countdown audio is really sub-standard. Plus, I really don't believe I received the only DVD of this movie from Amazon that has a bum audio track or tracks.

A very BIG let down, especially after reading some of the reviews about hearing the chopper blades, Tomcat afterburners, etc. But, after scanning the reviews once again, it appears that the comments about a great audio experience were related to the SD, not the Blu-Ray version. So, it appears that one has the choice of a great picture and lousy audio Blu-Ray version or a so-so picture and great audio SD version? Maybe I need to try the SD version up-converted on my Blu-Ray player?

So, I give this Blu-Ray version of the movie a 5 star rating, but subtract 2 stars for the lousy sub-standard audio.

I'd love to hear from any one else who has purchased the Blu-Ray version regarding what you think of the audio. TIA for any responses!!

Update: I ordered the Standard Definition, Widescreen version from Amazon and the DTS 6.1 audio track sounds great, immediately kicked on my sub-woofer and the dynamic range gives the viewer a much better appreciation of what a F-14 Tomcat sounds like leaving a carrier deck with full afterburners. The Blu-Ray picture is of course better than the SD version, but with my BR player's up-conversion capability the SD picture still looks pretty darn good for a 29 year old movie. My recommendation, if you want to hear what this movie should sound like go with the SD version or wait until the audio tracks on the BR version are corrected. I will be returning the BR version because of the sub-standard audio.",1238112000,12,2232,4.600502512562814
418543,5,6302010306,"When I was a little kid in the 80s, this was one of the movies that would come on TBS or USA all the time. Whenever it did, my Dad, my brother or I would inform the other two, and we'd all enthusiastically gather around the TV in awe of this masterpiece. Needless to say, its been almost twenty years since then, and they don't show it anymore. So when my Dad's birthday rolled around this year, it seemed the perfect choice for a gift.
After Dad's birthday dinner when all the relatives had gone home, I decided to stay the night so Dad and I could kick back, split a pint of whiskey and re-absorb the brilliance that is ""The Final Countdown"".
Even three decades after it was made, this movie is still flawless. The script, the acting, the photography, the sound; I can't find a single fault anywhere. My dad had good taste back in the day. Who'd have thought?
What truly stands out about this movie when viewed today though is the casting and dialogue. If it had been made today, it would have been cast with a bunch of young male models with slick haircuts who can barely deliver a good line, let alone convey anything meaningful without speaking, and the story would be warped to pound some political statement into our heads about how war is horrible and pointless. We all know war is horrible and pointless, but like many horrible, pointless things it is also dramatic, interesting and a fact of life.

This movie doesn't have the spectacular special effects, nor the blood and gore, that contemporary movies have. Not even one robot, nary an alien to be found. It is, simply, an extemely well done sci-fi movie.

This movie comes across the cable/sat channels very seldom, and when it does, it's cut to shreds. To appreciate this film, you have to watch it uncut and uninterrupted. In pure quality and focus, it compares to ""Patton"".

Besides the early and obvious plot-line, what this movie has going for it, primarily, are a younger Kirk Douglas and Martin Sheen. James Farrentino and Soon Tek-Oh are also plusses, if you can remember them, as is the always-beautiful Katharine Ross, and let's please not forget Charles Durning. All give excellent performances, and the air-to-air fight scenes (F-14 Tomcat vs. Japanese ""Zero"") are comparable to Top Gun.

What differentiates this movie from so many others is, this one actually has a singular, understandable plot. A 70's-class aircraft carrier goes through a time portal and winds up on the same Pacific Ocean, but on the day before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Will they save Pearl, or will they not interfere with history? The resolution of this singular plot is true suspense.

But it seems the answer is that funless fate will keep time on it's natural course, and you can't really change it, but just adjust it, or at least according to this film. But what the movie lacks in the satisfaction of seeing it's premise play out, it does have is the suspense and engagement in watching the film, heavily thanks to Michael Sheen and Kirk Douglas, two great actors sharing the screen.

And although the film doesn't carry with it a great deal of action, it does have the action of the carrier itself, as it seems to me at least, to be a very accurate portrayal of the ship, and it makes for a great backdrop to the movie. So, if you're a former Navy shipsman, or a time travel enthusiast, this movie broke a lot of ground, so check out this surprisingly good early 80s cult classic.",1231718400,2,1110,4.414634146341464

418639,2,6302010306,"First off, I love Sci-Fi, Time Travel, What-If, Alternate-History etc., movies, but I was bored off of my sofa with this snooze-fest. I was looking forward to watching this movie because I've read so much about it, and somehow never heard of it. I actually heard the 80's song by ""Europe"" of the same title... the one that goes through my mind every time I say the name of this movie, but never heard of this film until a few months back.

So, if someone can clue me in, as to what exactly I should be so excited about with this picture, I'd appreciate it. The story is very interesting, it's just that the movie didn't really do anything to put me in that period of history once they passed through the ""storm"" and they were transported back. The acting also was very, ummm, apathetic.

For some strange reason I kept thinking that I was watching a ""Made-For-Television-Movie"" from  around 1980. Apart from Kirk Douglas, the rest of the cast were television actors. Oh, sorry, then there was Ron O'Neal who was ""Superfly"" in that 70's blaxploitation film, ""Superfly"". One of the worst acted movies of all time. (Even though, I still love it.) Martin Sheen....another lousy actor. James Frentino and Katharine Ross are much better than the rest of the cast.

Oh well, I've seen so many movies, I guess I'm entitled to hating a few of them now and then.",1225238400,7,1352,4.574380165289257
418640,5,6302010306,"The Final Countdown makes for nearly 2 hours of great entertainment for people of all ages.

It can be seen by young children, as the violence is not nearly as bad as what is seen in films today. The foul langauge is minimal.

It is also THE BEST FILM for showing life and aircraft operations aboard a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.

The cast (stars Kirk Douglas, Martin Sheen, Charles Durning and James Farentino) are excellent, and play well off of each other.

The plot, which focuses on the Nimitz being time-warpped back to the day before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour is an excellent concept...especially for the late 1970's, when the movie was filmed.

The big issue among the main players is whether or not to interefere with the course of history...should they destroy the Japanese fleet - or let history take its course? If you have not seen the flim - I will not give anything away.

However, the real ""star"" of the film is the U.S.S. Nimitz...and her ""airwing"" consisting of the fighters-attack and other assorted combat warplanes. The markings on the aircraft were without question the coolest-looking of any ""carrier air wing"" at that time or since then. This is especially true of the F-14 Tomcat squadron ""VF-84 Jolly Rogers"" (with the skull & cross-bones markings).

You get to see ALL of the aircraft up-close and in great detail. You also get to see great footage of the crew preparing the planes for combat and launching off the deck.

You get to see flight-deck operations up close like no other movie...and far more realistic than seen in ""Top Gun"" (which was more ""Hollywood""-style entertainment). The fictional fight between two F-14s and two Japanese Zeros in Final Countdown was more realistic than the bigh fight at the end of ""Top Gun""!

I bet a lot of teenage boys joined the Navy after seeing this film when shown in theatres in 1980!

Some people believe ""Final Countdown"" is a new-take on ""Philadelphia Experiment""...about the World War II attempt by the U.S Navy to make ships invisible...and resulted in a horrible mishap to sailors onboard the ship.

Final Countdown has some plot holes...and could've spent more time on debating whether or not to change the course of history. But this may have been done because of time constraints.

If you have never seen ""Final Countdown"", I promise you will find it highly entertaining...and even thought-provoking!

P.S. The new Blu-Ray disc has several never-before seen extras...including an interview with the VF-84 Jolly Rogers F-14 Fighter squadron. This alone may make buying ""Final Countdown"" worth the price!!",1225152000,10,2602,4.954022988505747

They go back to 1941 and they are there for a long time just sending planes up and scouting and there is a few deaths and one American plane shoots down a jap plane and explodes but that is basically it. Torwards the end when they are going to get ready to intercept the japanese they get called back to the carrier and the attack on Pearl Harbor still happens. So what was the point of the movie, they didn't even really do anything. I liked it because I am huge into Time-Travel.

Generally, I get quite impatient with movies that are very inaccurate when it comes to technical details, but ""The Final Countdown"" is different.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Final-Countdown-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000096IAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Final Countdown (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;With a storyline involving a time warp that takes a nuclear powered aircraft carrier back to December 1941 and the attack on Pearl Harbor, the basic premise is science fiction rather than anything historical or documentary.  Therefore, it really doesn't matter that there is little attention to the accuracy I usually like to see given respect by a film maker.  Instead, this movie is just easy entertainment that is enjoyable.  The acting isn't great.  Kirk Douglas was 63 when he made the movie, 15 to 20 years older than a carrier captian would be in real life, and the script leaves a lot to be desired in places.  But the film is still enjoyable if the viewer simply accepts it for what it is.  Perhaps the best part is the music score, while the worst is the narrative of the cinematographer in the ""special features"" section of the DVD.  Along with ""Somewhere in Time,"" it is the best of the movies I have seen with a time warp theme.

If we do that, we can take out all inferences to cheesy special effects, and we can arrive at the conclusion that (for it's time) this was a great movie. Top Gun was still 6 years in the future (which, in my opinion, doesn't hold a candle to this movie in terms of visual photography or visual continuity). These were real pilots and enlisted personnel on a real ship, save for the few stars that were in the film. It's doubtful that we could make a similar movie today and still maintain the full cooperation of the Navy and the crew of a nuclear aircraft carrier. Part movie and part documentary, it brings up questions that we still struggle with today (both in film and in reality) concerning time travel and past/present/future possibilities.",1196553600,,782,4.585714285714285

The ending doesn't really resolve anything (what could one expect? Nazi America because they never enter the war?... but with a ship like that on their side... oh heck you get the picture, this is brain candy more than anything else....) but at least it leaves you thinking and on top of that there are quite a few surprises along the way.

It was said by some that the amount of detail regarding carrier operations provided potential ememies of the US with too much information. I disagree - real potential enemies would have already known about such things - even more so. Instead, I think it gave the viewing public a good appreciation for what men and women (although there were no service women seen on the ship) in military service (in this case, the Navy)do and the dangers they face on the job. It was great that the producers actually used real servicemen from the carrier in the film.

Notwithstanding Douglas's overacting, it was a most enjoyable film. It was also difficult to find, both in stores and rental houses. Thanks to Amazon.com, I now have my own copy of this movie.

418745,5,6302010306,"Having read the novel first, I was anxious to see the movie and must say that the film remains true to its paper predecessor.

In brief, the story is of a modern American carrier, the Nimitz, travelling back in time through a freak storm to the day before Pearl Harbor. The crew and its civilian guest, Warren Lasky, attempt to unravel the mystery while preparing to defend the strategic port from the impending Japanese attack.

There is not much not to like about the film (given that one likes this type of story), but the highlight to me was the excellent photography of carrier air operations in action. There are some outstanding aerial sequences captured on film.

The tale flows very nicely and is tightly wrapped up in the final scenes when the Nimitz returns to port in modern day Pearl Harbor. I won't spoil the ending as that really makes the film credible. Let's just say it is well thought out and expertly delivered.

Rent it or buy it. I don't think you'll be sorry you did.

A time travel movie about the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Nimitz getting caught in a storm and sent back to December 6th 1941. With the chance to stop the attack on pearl harbor. with Kirk Douglas and martin sheen u know it must have some quality they alone make it and interesting mix of talent

The Video

The video is better than any othe transfer of this movie before it is crisp clear no fuzz or noise. It is availble in full and widescreen. Widescreen is the only way to see the whole movie the it was shot for the theater

The audio

the 5.1 mix is stellar and really rumbles the room thru the storm and other shots. There is also a 2.0 mix which is ok but where it shines is its dtx mix it is mind blowing

The Extras

Commentary

from The Director And photographer as very boring to listen too they seem bored and uninterested in what they are saying plus get off topic alot

Theatrical Trailers

Nice to see but really bad quality

T.V. spots

More trailers

Bonus Disc if u get the 2 disc limited edition

Inteview with Associate Producer Llyod  Kaufman not very interesting makes u say where are the stars who cares about producers

Interviews with jolly rogers f-14 squadron

more fluff with nothing to really do with the movie

418838,5,6302010306,One of my favorite movies.  I wore out the VHS tape.  Great story.  Credible characters.  Should be in everyone's library!,1127606400,6,122,4.95
418839,4,6302010306,"What would otherwise be a B-movie plot for sure is greatly enhanced by a combination of great (for its time) aviation photography and a few inside jokes solely for pilots. For example, when the F-14s first engage the Japanese Zeros, the first Zero is shown trying to climb away. Preposterous, you say....but the Zero in 1941 was the best climbing fighter aircraft around! A similar ""inside joke"" is represented by the F-14s going into full wing sweep as they prepare to engage. Since the wing sweep is applicable to supersonic flight, the 14s would not have even been able to engage 300 knot Zeros at mach 2.5!!! finally, when the Senator and his aide are rescured by a helicopter, we are reminded of the relatively recent vintage thereof by his question: ""What kind of machine is this?""",1127606400,5,787,4.751824817518248
418840,4,6302010306,"A fun movie with good acting from the main roles. The special effects are laughable today but it's great to see the old japanese planes in the air vs the US jets. It's a shame that the big battle works out the way it does, but overall I guess it needs to happen the way it does.",1123804800,,278,3.8947368421052633
418841,5,6302010306,"I remember this movie from the theaters and when it was coming out on DVD I think I picked up the first copy.  The mighty F14 has now ended it's career in the US Military but this movie will make anyone who is fan of modern fighter aircraft say WOW.  Many others have commented upon this movie and it's story is already very well known.  Suffice to say if you like air to air combat, have ever wondered what would happen if the past military technolgies met the present, or have an interest in time travel.  Then this movie is for you.  True there are some confusing and out of place bits such as when the A7 Corsair (identified in the scene selections as ""A destroyer comes aboard"") comes aboard after the Nimitz passes thru the time storm that just don't seem to make much sense.  But without a doubt the highlight is after Kirk Douglas's imortal lines ""Alert one (the F14s this is Eagle one (the Nimitz), play with them throw them off, but don't fire"". We then see two F14s mix it up with two Zeros.  Here is a bit of useless movie trivia; these Zeros are actual highly modified T6 Texan's and where actually used in the orginal Pearl Harbor movie ""Tora Tora Tora"".",1122854400,4,1168,4.354838709677419
418842,5,6302010306,"I live in Hawaii overlooking Pearl Harbor.  Aircraft carriers are a common sight, and this movie shows them at their best!  I have personally been on dozens of aircarft carriers.  Some of the aircraft used in the film are no longer in the Navy inventory, such as the A6. Even the wonderful F-14 has been retired this year (2006) too.  The scene with the F-14 tomcats ""playing"" with Japanese Zeros is ""priceless"".  I can't count how many times I've watched that scene and it continues to impress me.  I love this movie, and recommend it in the stongest possible terms.",1115510400,6,567,4.62
418843,4,6302010306,"This is a wonderful movie despite some holes in the plot that are bigger than the storm the Nimitz went through. This is a thought provoking flick where you inevitably find yourself asking, what would I do? And not just for the whole scenario, but for each major character, because they all face certain demons and inner dialogues that comes with each their respective chosen occupations. Kirk Douglas and Martin Sheen are at the top of their game for this flick and the supporting cast is top notch. The film's a bit dated, but it still holds up very well. The upgrade on the DVD is spectacular, particularly in the visual department, but they could have thinned the extras, used only one disk and trimmed the price a bit. Let's face it, on most DVD's, you might watch all the extras once and then probably never again. For a movie that clocks in at barely over an hour and a half and also has appeared on television too many times to count, the need for two disks seems a bit much, especially for the asking price. However, if you're like me and enjoy watching this thought provoking film at least once a year, then I highly recommend that you purchase this new and vastly improved DVD upgrade. You might want to also grab the somewhat related ""The Philidelphia Experiment"" for a really rousing double-feature.

  For those of you panning this flick because there's no showdown between the Tomcats and Zeroes (and there shouldn't be one), I'm afraid you've missed the point of the whole movie. Just go rent Top Gun, you big geek!",1106697600,16,1531,4.6007326007326
418844,5,6302010306,"I thought the Platinum Edition of the VHS was a good version, watching it on TV. But the 2-disc Limited Edition by Blue Underground is amazing in the transfer. First, I have not watched it on TV, but on my computer DVD player. Everything comes out crsytal clear, and just shines in its presentation. In the movie, you can relate to Captain Yellen (Kirk Douglas) of the U.S.S. Nimitz Aircraft Carrier. (I am a Navy Officer and I follow Navy procedures, even though I have no idea who I am working for as of now -- and as System Analyst (Martin Sheen) presents you with your alternative Commander-In-Chief -- President Franklin Delanor Roosevelt - you shrug your shoulders! Got to follow Command, whenever I am!) Your going out for an exercise, but at the last minute you have to wait 2 days for a civilian to come aboard. It's going to be a one of those days, as you find out that he (Martin Sheen) is a System Analyst. By the way, what is it you do? I work for my boss, who helped design the Nimitz Class Carrier, and there are always alternatives in improving efficiency aboard a U.S. Navy Vessel.

Fine or so as Captain you say! But while out at sea, a phenomena engulfs you, and you wonder if this is some sort of Navy Department Test, you are taking. Suddenly after a while you find that you are back in time on December 6, 1941, a day before the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor. This ship can handle any threat should it occur from the Japanese Fleet, but you already know history. But if you interfere (again from the System Analyst now on board) history will be changed. It is not a simple question, but to Captain Yellen it is. Should they launch their attack, the U.S.S. Nimitz and crew can easily handle the 353 Zero Japanese airplane Attack Force, and easily sink all the ships within the Japanese Fleet. But you will be taking your orders from the now President -- Franklin Delanor Roosevelt, if they ever believe you, and if you can convince them, without going in to talk to them or they coming out to visit you 280 miles West of Pearl Harbor. After watching the movie, it brings up theoretical questions of how would the world be today. Being 40 years from the future, you are the alien with the alien technology. No problem for the Atomic Bomb, you have those on board, and quite sophisicated by 1940's standards, of which they have not even thought about those yet, since the WWII is just beginning. Would you end up in Port, with scientists trying to take apart your technology from the future? Would they be able to understand your technology or just use it in WWII? The What If's are lent to the imagination after viewing the film, as the portal of electrical and vortex storm take you forward in time to where you were -- 1980! History is preserved, and you have to tell the Top Brass, how an aircraft carrier got lost at sea, and all that had happened, as you were transported back in time by a mysterious storm that was there one sweep of the radar and gone the next sweep. This may well boggle your mind, as you learn some physics about what scientists now think about Creation nowadays! I leave you to watch a great movie, that only tends to scratch the surface of transporting one through time, and the consequences of what may or may not happen depending on any action that you would take, while you time traveled and are the alien with the advanced technology.",1105920000,10,3388,4.446945337620579
418845,5,6302010306,"I've seen this movie at least a dozen times and even though it's worn thin from over-viewing, it still remains to be one of my favorite movies in my collection. Some questions the movie suggests (like ""How would a storm cause a ship to travel through time"" and ""How did it 'follow' the ship no matter which way it turned?"") go unanswered, but I think these are moot points when one keeps his/her attention on the main plot. I thought there was some overacting in this movie, but as the saying goes, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"". I thought the surprise ending was excellent. Really top notch. It follows some of the time-travel theories that have been presented and seems to be a very logical conclusion to the movie. I really do recommend this movie to time travel fans.",1098748800,8,775,4.50354609929078
418846,4,6302010306,"I first saw this on ABC as a kid, and loved it.  Seeing it again now, at 31, I don't find it nearly as interesting but still think it's a fine film.  Check out how much young Martin Sheen looks like Charlie Sheen!  Watch James Farentino, the TV version of Roy Scheider!  And don't miss the surprise ending!",1089504000,6,306,4.224137931034483
418847,3,6302010306,"The USS Nimitz, a nuclear aircraft carrier, is on a routine assignment when the civilian systems specialist Warren Lasky (Martin Sheen) is flown to the aircraft carrier.  Lasky's job is to evaluate the efficiency of the commander and crew as he should make recommendations in regards to what changes can be done to save tax dollars.  Soon after Lasky's arrival Captain Matthew Yelland (Kirk Douglas) is put in a difficult position as the USS Nimitz is pulled into an outlandish electrical storm that relocates the warship in time.  Captain Yelland is unsure about what truly has happened, but when they discover that they are in between the Japanese Naval Force that is about to strike at Pearl Harbor on December 6, 1941 they realize they might have a chance to undo history.  Final Countdown is an interesting science fiction film that offers some room for thinking, yet it is entertaining as it displays the incredible event of time traveling.  An appealing idea together with entertainment, Final Countdown offers a decent cinematic experience, which will stand its ground.",1089504000,11,1077,5.062146892655368
418848,5,6302010306,"Since so many reviews are already posted, I'll keep this brief.  It's nice to see this film get such an excellent DVD release. This movie is great and has aged quite well.  The premise of the Nimitz being thrown back into time and given the opportunity to change the course of world history is an intriuging one even today. The Final Countdown boasts some ofthe best aircraft footage ever caught on film, hollywood or documentary.  The scene between the Jolly Rogers F-14's and the 2 Japanese Zero fighters is a timeless classic.
The sound is excellent, the transfer is quite good, and the 2 disc set includes very special bonuses for fans of the F-14, or aviation in general.  And the bonus disc interviews the Jolly Rogers squadron that flew in the film, worth it if you are an avaiation fan.  If not, you might still enjoy it anyways, as they certainly have an entertaining story about one of the cast members!",1087603200,6,913,4.611111111111111
418849,5,6302010306,"THE FINAL COUNTDOWN has a very intriguing premise and because of an expert cast and a sense of patriotic gusto, it is quite good in spite of its plot holes.
A mysterious storm (similar to the one in Philadelphia Experiment) transports the USS Nimitz back in time to the eve of the attack of Pearl Harbor.  Should the Nimitz interfere with history of should they let things go?  The ramifications are quite obvious.  Kirk Douglas is staunch and as always dependable in his role; James Farentino is quite good as his flight commander; a young Martin Sheen is an appropriate civilian interference; Charles Durning is purely dislikeable as the Senator rescued by the Nimitz; and Katharine Ross has never looked lovelier as Durning's personal assistant.  The film maintains a quite suspense and the scene with Soon Taik Oh as the captured Japanese pilot is very intense and frightening.
Any movie that deals with time travel will leave unanswered questions, but THE FINAL COUNTDOWN offers good, mind-intriguing entertainment.",1087171200,2,1020,5.089820359281437
418850,5,6302010306,"Blue Underground has done a great job with this DVD and has finally given the film the high-definition transfer it has deserved after all these years.  The color-correction done to the film makes most scenes look great even compared to today's movies.  The soundtrack is flowing, emotional, and has some very memorable tunes.  The flying sequences of the F-14s and other aircraft are TOP NOTCH and blow any other movie with jet aviation OUT OF THE WATER (this includes movies with a much larger budget such as Top Gun).  Speaking of budget, the only vice of this movie is in the special effects.  These are present during the storm sequence.  It is mentioned in the commentary that the film crew was out of money at the time and it shows.  This caveat will not spoil the film for people that watch a movie for more than special effects.  The flying scenes are action-packed and the intriguing time-travel plot is tense.
Due to the film's relative obscurity, it's a great movie to show to friends that have likely not seen it.  It can be a hit even with people that have no special interest in time-travel nor aviation.  The next time you have some friends over, show them this DVD and enjoy a great discussion about the possibilities that are presented in the movie.  If anyone would like to further discuss the film, go here:  [...]",1086134400,9,1333,4.625531914893617
418851,5,6302010306,"This is a must for anybody who like Martin Sheene or Kirk Douglas. The action and special effects are great for 1980 and the scene with F14 Tomcats buzzing past and shooting down two Japanese Zero Zero's is great.
I have watched this so many times, the tape is wearing out. A great Sci Fi Movie and based on actual events of time travel by the US Government. Get it whilst you can etc.",1084233600,2,385,4.216216216216216
418852,5,6302010306,"Twenty-four years ago I saw this movie while a member of the armed forces.  As a fan of the old Irwin Allen Time Tunnel series I was intrigued with how the movie portrayed the situation with the Nimitz.
What I haven't seen mentioned is the book by Martin Caidin that added details to the movie that the producers didn't think about.  I think that any serious fan of the movie should read the book and then watch the new DVD.  I will add one incident from the book where the Japanese pilot's reactions to the F-14s initial onslaught are recorded.  He talks about this being the first time he has ever heard the engine of another aircraft inside his aircraft.
Hopefully if this movie is ever remade with modern CGI they can include something similar.  I think it would be incredibly effective considering that the movie pilot of the ""Zero"" had an interesting mishap when the film was shot.
This is a movie that would really benefit from additional scenes, additional comments and even added dialogue.  I noted that the trailers that are included with the new release have some additional dialogue that could have been used.
Overall, this is much better than the original theatrical release and infinitely better than the VHS that I bought for eighty dollars eighteen years ago from a video store.

One negative comment I will make regarding the actors is primarily aimed at Catherine Ross.  As an old Star Trek fan I found her endless repeated ""Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,"" to be reminiscent of the worst Star Trek Episode ""Spock's Brain,"" Brain, Brain what is Brain.  This is a plot where the female role could be expanded to a female pilot - we are in the 21st century now.  It would have been interesting to see if a female pilot had waxed the zero or been his rescuer.

As many people have stated technically this is a very well done DVD and for that Blue Underground should get recognition.  I just hope that in its next incarnation Final Countdown or a movie like it takes the incredible reality of the Nimitz, her crew and the hardware and puts a personal side on it.

On a last note, I liked the former F-14 pilots joking about what they would have really done.  It added a nice element, but one thing I thought was missing.  They all talked about how Navy men would have loved to have wiped out the Nimitz and how could they have accepted a recall.  The question I would have asked them is would all ninety pilots have accepted the recall?  Imagine if just one pilot lost a relative during Pearl Harbor.  Would that pilot have accepted the recall?",1083715200,8,2553,4.56140350877193
418853,5,6302010306,"After many years, ""The Final Countdown"" sees a deserved DVD release, and unexpectedly in a collector's edition with lots of extras.
TFC is a popcorn ""what-if"" fantasy in which the US aircraft carrier Nimitz travels back in time/space to the day before the Pearl Harbor attack.  Once they realize where and when they are, the crew faces the philosophical decision of whether or not to interfere.  It's a thought-provoking discussion, but this film doesn't tie itself up in ethical knots.  All the better to enjoy the reasonably good special effects and military action.  (There is a dogfight between and F-14 and a Japanese fighter that really doesn't qualify as a ""fight"").
Kirk Douglas is good as always - in fact, I can't immediately recall him in a later film.  Martin Sheen is convincing as an civilian reporter on board, and James Farentino performs as the XO with a destiny.  Katherine Ross...well, let's just say that Katherine Ross is in this film.
It's not Citizen Kane - there are more than its fair share of continuity errors, cliches, anachronisms, and leaps in logic.  Perhaps the worst flaw is Soon-Tek Oh portraying yet another sinister psychotic Asian villain. (You would think that at least a Japanese actor would be cast as a Japanese pilot). But on balance there is nothing that can't be ignored if one is already sitting through a time travel flick.

418854,5,6302010306,"WOW!!  This is better than it was in the theather!  Dolby 5.1, extras and much more.  If your a fan of this film, this is the quality you have been waiting for.  If your a former Nimitz crew member I strongly suggest you consider this.  The extra's with stills of the Nimitz and ship patches is well worth having.",1082505600,,313,4.237288135593221
418875,3,6302010306,"Released just about a year before Speilberg's ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" upped the ante on audience expectations for big-screen adventure fantasy, Don Taylor's cultish 1980 sci-fi time travel thriller feels a bit lumbering in retrospect. Stalwart and noble Kirk Douglas is well cast as captain of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, assigned duty to modern-day Pearl Harbor. When a mysterious electro-magnetic storm sends the entire ship hurtling back to December 6, 1941, you've got a real corker of a setup. Unfortunately, once everyone figures out the Where and When We Are and the What We Can Do To Change The Course Of History, the film is about three-quarters over, and the denouement seems anti-climatic. Interestingly, the most tense, gripping moment in the film has nothing to do with big special effects but takes place on board the ship when a captured Japanese pilot, confused, angry and scared out of his wits, makes a desperate and doomed attempt to escape. The violence in this scene is unexpectedly realistic, genuinely shocking, and well played by all the actors involved. A good cast and compelling premise keeps you watching, but be warned that the film sags almost fatally in places (one too many drawn-out, jingoistic sequences of fighter planes taking off and landing on the carrier deck to the strains of an  overbearingly ""stirring"" score). All that being said, this is a movie I know I will watch again! Go figure.",1082505600,3,1435,5.00418410041841
418876,3,6302010306,"For so many years I have waited for this movie to reappear in its original widescreen format and with better sound than at the movie theatres, and now I own it, and am disappointed.
This refers to the single-disc edition, and I don't think that the very limited 2-disc edition is worth the price, just to watch some Navy pilots blabbering about how well they fly.
It is only too obvious that they have to do a good job, in order to lift-off and land on an aircraft carrier in motion.
No. I am more disappointed about the fact of the dated special effects. For once, I am more caring about the effects than the acting.
Nothing wrong with the acting, actually the best part of the movie, with actors such as Kirk Douglas, Martin Sheen and Charles Durning.
No. It is truly the effects that are totally outdated and that could have been digitally enhanced with modern CG technology, a bit as they have already done with the Star Wars trilogy and other similar movies of that period.
Especially the so-called ""time-tunnel storm"", which in itself is impressive, as a concept, not as the actual effect, could have been given a special treatment from the guys at ILM, and since this is a key scene which recurs in the movie, I would have expected for this edition to be enhanced, but instead nada.
Same applies for the aircraft battle scenes, in which one can clearly see that some are plain model kits out of the box.
For Heavens sake, didn't anybody notice it?
Such a fine movie, with a very original story and such fine actors, loses out in the one thing that matters most in a film of this genre: its visual and graphic effects.
In comparison, movies like The Philadelphia Experiment or even Buckaroo Banzai, did a far better job in the effects department, and even if they're a bit dated in today's comparison, still they are a fresh reminder of how a creative mind can change even the most primitive effect into something spectacular to the eye.
Instead, Final Countdown, falls short in this instance, with very flat and primitive SFX, which should have been corrected and enhanced for the re-release of such a commemorative DVD.
Concerning the image quality in itself, and the sound, there is nothing to criticize, quite the contrary, they are even better than the original theatrical release.
Still one would have expected a little bit more and not just in the bonus department, which at least, from what I have read, has not much to offer.
Besides, in both version, there is just one commentary, as if Martin Sheen was too busy, and even if Kirk Douglas is not in the best of shapes, at least his son Michael, could have made an effort to appear in the commentary section.
But as we all know, many people consider sitting to comment a movie, an abismal shame, since it is not so well retributed. Yet this is still part of a service to the audience and since the audience is ultimately the one who decides whether a movie is worth it or not, it seems that in this case, all parties involved were too busy doing something else, such as sunbathing.
Good for them!
So then, why all this mumbo jumbo about a re-release, when no one seemed to care anyway, not even the producers?
Go figure. But at the price offered, it is far too poor to be enjoyed.
No wonder, when one sees what other titles ""Blue Underground"" has to offer. Jess Franco's classics no less!
And who's Jess Franco, if not a second rate director from Spain?
As if he were the Orson Welles of that venerable country.
Ever heard of Luis Bunuel or Carlos Saura?
Jess Franco is not even the Sergio Leone of Spain. Far, far from it. And he's not even a Roger Corman, master of the B-movies.
So what is he, to be so vastly acclaimed in the list of movies here, among which ""The Final Countdown"" is truly out of place.
C'mon, couldn't the original studio pick it up and do a better job with it?
Unfortunately I cannot remember if it was released through Universal or through some other major studio, but being a Bryna Production (Kirk Douglas' own company), I would not be astonished if it were.
Pity. Other than that and if you have the money to invest, buy it, but if you are bit short, stick to the original ""Time Machine"" or better still, buy Disney's ""20,000 Leagues under the Sea"", or again 20th Century-Fox's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth.
Now there you have your full money's worth!
Stick to the true classics and you will never go wrong.
I give you my word for it.",1082160000,2,4433,4.487623762376238
418877,5,6302010306,"Hats off to the makers of this DVD; a very professional job.  One of the movies I enjoyed years ago, and it has not been available in any quality form for decades now (hard to believe but it is 24 year old now).  I noticed 3 versions are available, I received the 2-Disc set (widescreen and second extras disc); the prices look similiar so this or the FULL SCREEN version (if that is your preference) would seem to be the way to go.
To anyone who has not seen this movie; it features just an amazing amount of footage that showcases the aircraft carrier (it is really the star of the show, with the crew); and many of the actors are obviously CREW MEMBERS of the ship ... which makes some of the poor acting actually a nice touch.  You can almost imagine the PROFESSIONAL ACTORS trying to bring up the performances of the crew who would have been having a ""dream come true"" experience with the Movie Crew on-board.  A very special movie indeed.
So I definately recommend this movie.  The restored DVD was done with a real professionalism and care. A real treat to see it in a form that is superior by far to any version seen before.",1082073600,,1132,4.345971563981043
418878,5,6302010306,"I just finished viewing this exceptional release of 'The Final Countdown' and am amazed that the HD transfer came through so well from a 24 year old negative! This film combines the  best elements of the action, fantasy and sci-fi genres and wraps it all up in a real 'popcorn' movie. Since it had been so long since I'd seen it, it was like watching a brand-new release. The trailers on disc I are in mono and what a revelation when the movie starts with an all-new THX logo specifically created for this film (a la T2 and Toy Story) and then the Dolby Digital 6.1 kicks in. Wow! I don't have a 6.1 setup or DTS, but both are available on this disc.
The reason it outdoes 'Top Gun' is in storyline. As in 'Top Gun' actually had no discernible plot.
If you enjoy time paradoxes, this is a must see film, especially in this outstanding DVD presentation. A keeper!",1081555200,3,862,4.354037267080745

The picture quality is outstanding, the acting is corny, the melodramic music that plays throughout the movie gets on your nerves, special affects going through the time warp hole whatever you call it looks like a bad night in a disco bar in the 1970's. Now for the good stuff, the aerial scenes and scenes on the flight deck I thought were very good, when they first come out of the time hole they don't realize what happened and trying to figure it out was good but then they lose it on the story line.

418880,4,6302010306,"""What if...?""  It's a question people often ask themselves, especially when mulling over past events.  ""What if I'd gotten up the nerve to ask her out?""  ""What if I'd stood up to my boss?""  ""What if the U.S. had never gotten involved in the Vietnam war?""  ""What if the Nazis had developed the atomic bomb before the United States?""  Well, director Don Taylor's 1980 science-fiction flick THE FINAL COUNTDOWN--a long-standing cult favorite to many genre fans--asks the audience to ponder THIS question: ""What if a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier had been part of the U.S. Navy's arsenal at the beginning of WWII?""
The plot? The U.S.S. Nimitz, a modern-day nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, gets scooped into a mysterious weather anomaly and is thereby transported back to the year 1941 on the eve of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  Once the captain and crew accept the fact that they have traveled back in time, the story revolves around their struggle in deciding whether or not technology from 1980 should be used to aid the WWII-era Navy and thereby change the course of history by thwarting the infamous Japanese air raid.
In many respects, THE FINAL COUNTDOWN is a somewhat clichd time-travel adventure that some critics have likened to an expanded version of one of the substandard episodes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  While it is true that the film's premise isn't the freshest of ideas, and though some of the special FX--especially those representing the time portal--are rather cheesy, excellent performances from principals Kirk Douglas and Martin Sheen and from supporting actors Katharine Ross, James Farentino, and Ron O'Neal raise this fantasy film way above the standard Hollywood B-grade science-fiction fare.  In addition, the movie was lensed aboard the actual Nimitz with full cooperation from the U.S. Navy, and this creates a sense of genuine realism and authenticity rarely offered by SF and fantasy flicks.  (Indeed, some critics and film historians have lauded the film for its documentary-like depiction of Naval personnel in action.)
Blue Underground's new DVD versions of THE FINAL COUNTDOWN are just this side of SF heaven, especially for longtime fans of the film.

You want to see the US Navy kick the tar out of the Imperial Japanese Fleet, but they don't.  They plan to kick the tar out of them, then don't.  Your ready for a can of whip azz to be opened up and it ain't.  It's just a huge string along until you get to the point when we're gonna attack and then.....we don't again.  BAH!  I suppose the writers were either not very creative or were all wrapped up in the Gordian knot of paradox.  WELL PARADOX DOSEN'T EXIST!  The other point I would make here is how could they make this into a 2 disk movie?  What extra's could they possibly show?  Something like the director saying ""...and here is where we almost attacked the Japanese fleet....""  Boring!  The acting is sub-par also.

418882,5,6302010306,"I'll echo the other reviews regarding the Blue Underground 2-disc special edition.  The quality of this dvd is outstanding!  The digital transfer of both audio and video is first-rate, and really brings out the best of this great movie.  After not seeing this film for many years, the aerial scenes are even better than I remembered (THX/DTS sound definitely helps), and arguably better than Top Gun (no studio F-14 cockpits - real cockpits in the air with real pilots).  Check out the featurettes to find out how close some of the aerial close-ups really got!  Being a former aviation ordnanceman, I felt a surge of pride seeing the red-shirts bustin out some serious munitions.  Keep in mind - in most films where the military aircraft are real, all the ordnance you see is not.  Since most moviegoers don't know the difference, filmmakers don't bother to alter the inert markings on the bombs and missiles (they'd have to do it in post-production, because the Navy may let them film, but altering ordnance is a no-no).  Likewise, any firing of ordnance is simulated with special effects.  Obviously, this is due to safety and cost, and directors' perceptions of what it ""should"" look like.  I guess the policy was a little different in 1980, because I see a surprising amount of live stuff in The Final Countdown, including live, fused, Mk-82 bombs, a real Sidewinder missile shoot and what certainly appears to be live 20mm cannon fire from an F-14.  That was near impossible to fake in 1980, especially considering the quality of storm effects in the movie.  Of course, they cut to the zero using a smoke generator, or the model plane bursting into flames, but everything you see on the F-14's before that is genuine.  I don't think they made blanks for the M61 Vulcan then, so that burst of smoke means rounds were going down-range (if you look closely frame-by-frame you can see about 2 or 3 projectiles zipping out, although the camera angle would make any water impacts out of frame).  Apparently, much of the carrier ops filmed were part of a live Navy exercise, and the film crew was just in the right place at the right time to get some great footage.  It is rare you see that kind of stuff outside of a serious military or war documentary, especially as a major part of the plot in a feature film with top-notch photography!  Although there is certainly some movie magic in The Final Countdown (some of it not so magical anymore), what makes it a remarkable and classic film is the amount of it that is real aircraft, real military operations, real sailors and pilots and ""aviators"", and really cool flying.  This dvd was well worth the wait, and thanks to the other reviewers here, I avoided the Pacific Family Entertainment version.  Thanks Blue Underground!",1080950400,12,2773,4.753653444676409

Not ever having done any business with PACIFIC FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT I got them to confirm that the DVD was DIGITALLY REMASTERED! When I got it, I analyzed the picture VIA computer and found that it was really ANALOG and copied from tape [Probably VHS]. I sent PACIFIC FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT a detailed letter explaining what I had found. I never heard back from anyone there. Probably because I found out why their production of this movie was so SUBSTANDARD.
Then earlier this year I learned that BLUE UNDERGROUND was going to DIGITALLY remaster both the audio & video from the ORIGINAL negative . I bought the movie and just watched it. It's much better than anything ever made including the ORIGINAL THEATER RELEASE!

This disc is now one of my top ten in both the movie itself and most especially for the incredible production values put into this ultimate disc from BLUE UNDERGROUND; they are now my favorite production company.  The video is perfectly clear, and the sound will bring down the walls.  The opening sequence of the film is now one of my all-time favorites now that I've seen it widescreen and with remastered sound.  The way the director holds the shot of the F-14 taking off and the pilot's dialog with Pearl Tower prior to takeoff must be experienced.  This disc is definitive proof that when a production company takes the time to do it right (THX, widescreen, extras, etc.) the resultant experience can be euphoria.  Ever since I bought ""ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST"", I have hoped that all discs would be treated with the same loving care and production values.

This is one of my all time favorite ""B"" movies and, as a former Air Force Pilot, I really appreciate seeing the flying sequences in anamorphic widescreen, just like in the original theatrical release. This is as good video transfer from the original negative that this film is probably capable of and Blue Underground has a spectacular release w/the added Dolby ver and THX sound tracks. Unlike most bonus discs, I found this one highly informative/enjoyable and definitely worth  watching.
One minor distraction is the loud ""clicks/pops"" when navigating the menus, chapter breaks and when the THX flag finishes.

Once I heard that Blue Underground was redoing it, it was hard to keep from being excited after what I read about this company.  The special edition released by Blue Underground definitely made up for the poor previous effort by PFE.
1.  Special Edition packaging was the best I have seen!  (I loved the lenticular 3D cover showing the Nimitz disappearing!)

The best part is when two Tomcats engage the 2 Zeros in retaliation for attacking the Senator's boat (anyway they were inadvertently headed for the Nimitz!)  You get to see a rather unequal dogfight between two of the best naval fighters in their respective period.
For the technically-minded, the baseline F-14As performed such fantastice manueveur and were always in control over the Zekes - despite having the troublesome TF-30s which did not flame out!

418937,5,6302010306,"This film is a neat little military/sci-fi thriller that ponders the question ""What if?"".
After traveling through a strange magnetic storm that renders its entire crew unconscious for a period of time, the U.S.S. Nimitz finds itself sitting near the Hawaiian islands just prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor.
As the evidence of their journey mounts, the Nimitz's skipper, Captain Matt Yellen, played effectively by Kirk Douglas, is forced to accept the circumstances thrust upon him and has to make the difficult decision of whether or not to intervene in the events rapidly approaching and change all of history.
The cast has plenty of star power--Douglas, Katherine Ross, Martin Sheen, Charles Durning, and James Farentino--so the studio didn't skimp on money for talent.  The special effects are minimal and the set pieces are provided by filming aboard an actual Navy ship.  That saves money (although I'm sure the U.S. Navy got a healthy check for its contributions).
There are some plot twists, including an obvious one at the end.  You also have the philosophical discussions on changing the past, with Yellen eventually just going with his gut instinct--and facing the possibility of taking orders from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt if they can't get back.  However, fate intervenes and we never get the answer to the question of ""What if?"".
Still, the movie is enjoyable overall...and there are some genuine laughs to be had during the scene where a rescued-at-sea U.S. Senator (Durning) tries to convince the radio operator at Pearl Harbor that he is calling from the U.S.S.

418943,4,6302010306,"""Saturday Night Live"" had a routine once that explored the nagging historical question, ""What is Napoleon had a B-52 at the Battle of Waterloo?""  Any kid who has thought about what difference machine guns would have made at the Alamo or the Little Big Horn can appreciate the impulse to help rewrite history with modern weaponry, which is the spirit behind the 1980 film ""The Final Countdown"" in which the nuclear powered aircraft carrier U.S.S. Nimitz is thrown back through time by a weird storm to early on the morning of December 7, 1941.  Suddenly visions of what one fully armed flight of naval fighter jets could do to the flimsy prop planes of the Japanese surprise attack are flashing through out mind.
On the one hand ""The Final Countdown"" is one of those time travel movies where you do not think too seriously about the mechanism by which the ship ends up in the past (at least they did not think themselves back like Christopher Reeves in ""Somewhere in Time"").  But on the other hand the characters take the situation and its implications seriously.  Kirk Douglas is Captain Matthew Yelland, who has to figure out what his responsibilities are under such strange circumstances.  James Farentino is Commander Richard Owens, who is a student of the Pearl Harbor attack and is able to provide all the historical explication anyone needs.  Martin Sheen is Warren Lasky, a reporter along for the ride who becomes the chief devil's advocate in the deliberations.  The historical situation is further complicated when jets from the carrier take out a couple of zeros that are strafing a yacht, and the Nimitz rescues U.S. Senator Samuel Chapman (Charles Durning) and his assistant Laurel Scott (Katharine Ross).  This is a pretty good cast for this sort of plot.
Consequently, we have not only the debate about whether or not history should be changed, but the entanglement of military protocol (imagine Admiral Chester Nimitz being told there is an aircraft carrier that is twice the size of anything he has in his navy and it is named after him).  The fact that the characters take the situation seriously makes up for a lot of the flaws in this film, but in the end we are left with what is basically a shaggy dog story.  If it were not for the nice little twist at the end, I would probably have knocked another star off of the rating for this film.  But as stupid as it is on several levels, it is an enjoyable little excursion and the producers take full advantage of having a real U.S. nuclear carrier to play with.

Notabily the major missing scene ais the memorable flight scene with a Japanese Zero and and F-14 Tomcat flying together in the clouds. That scene, with the musical score was really cool, and it was what made the movie, IMO. The same scene is only a few seconds long in this edition.

418952,5,6302010306,"I have always liked this movie. Sure, the story never reaches its purported climax, but there's a lot of fun getting there ...
Let me address the DVD issue right off: I have (apparently) a remastered version, widescreen, with chapter selection and promotional trailer included. The quality of this DVD is pretty good. I can't remember the exact cinematography but it seems like this is how the movie always appeared. Not top-notch but acceptable. The trailer is not as well preserved but is OK.
(I noticed this on the Rambo: First Blood Part II DVD I just bought ... on that DVD, the trailer is so-so, however the picture on that movie is crisp and very well preserved).
OK, back to the movie. A freak storm catches the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier and transports her and her crew back to December 6, 1941 just off the coast of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The BIG question: Ignore or Intercept the Japanese Navy when it attacks on December 7? ... if you haven't seen the movie, I won't spoil it for you here.
There are top-named actors like Martin Sheen, Kirk Douglas, James Farentino, Katharine Ross and Charles Durning. And there are a few real carrier personnel who weren't professional actors, obviously. But they got to be in the movie and who could blame them? Most people who like this film enjoy the time-travel, naval-combat aspect of it and overlook the occasional potholes in the storyline. Hey, just have fun!
There are some great launch sequences of Naval fighter aircraft, recon birds, tankers and helicopters. And the inflight sequences are pretty good too.

418953,5,6302010306,"I have always liked this movie.  Sure, the story never reaches its purported climax, but there's a lot of fun getting there ...
Let me address the DVD issue right off:  I have (apparently) a remastered version, widescreen, with chapter selection and promotional trailer included.  The quality of this DVD is pretty good.  I can't remember the exact cinematography but it seems like this is how the movie always appeared.  Not top-notch but acceptable.  The trailer is not as well preserved but is OK.
(I noticed this on the Rambo: First Blood Part II DVD I just bought ... on that DVD, the trailer is so-so, however the picture on that movie is crisp and very well preserved).
OK, back to the movie.  A freak storm catches the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier and transports her and her crew back to December 6, 1941 just off the coast of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.  The BIG question:  Ignore or Intercept the Japanese Navy when it attacks on December 7? ... if you haven't seen the movie, I won't spoil it for you here.
There are top-named actors like Martin Sheen, Kirk Douglas, James Farentino, Katharine Ross and Charles Durning.  And there are a few real carrier personnel who weren't professional actors, obviously.  But they got to be in the movie and who could blame them?  Most people who like this film enjoy the time-travel, naval-combat aspect of it and overlook the occasional potholes in the storyline.  Hey, just have fun!

418954,4,6302010306,"The nuclear aircraft carrier Nimitz is a fleet unto itself - its jet fighters, missiles and (presumably) nuclear weapons can win WWII several times over. On maneuvers off Hawaii in 1981, the ship encounters a mysterious storm finding itself cut off from fleet headquarters and its escorts. The only radio transmissions available broadcast Jack Benny and news of German tanks outside of Moscow. The untrained ears of some crewmen think that WWIII has broken out. The more trained ears have a more chilling idea: it sounds more like WWII has broken out. The storm - though cooler heads can't bring themselves to admit it ??? appears to have sent the Nimitz back to early December, 1941 ??? only days before the sneak attack on Pearl. Commander Matt Yellen (Douglas) is too officious to take any of these clues at face value, even when they involve sightings of Japanese fighters strafing American yachts ??? somebody is only trying to make the crew think it's gone back in time. The only true clue may rest with Mr. Lasky (Martin Sheen), a civilian analyst who works for the shadowy Mr. Tideman - a defense contractor who supplies Washington with much of its high-tech hardware (not a small amount of which found its way onto the Nimitz). While other officer debate whether they're being subjected to a massive practical joke or some kind of psych test, Lasky suggests not only that they have gone back in time, but that they can change history and save America from its day of infamy. Only when his reconnaissance planes spot the Japanese fleet on its way - to climb Mount Nitakaa??? (the supposed encoded authorization for the attack) does Yellen realize that he is now back in 1941.
""Final Countdown"" shouldn't work, but it's fun anyway. The maneuvering F-14s provide some of the best footage of dogfighting available until ""Top Gun"" - including an epic battle between the mach-2 jets and a hapless pair of Zero fighters (who are unlucky enough to meet the jets at that moment when Kirk Douglas changes his mind and decides that he has gone back to 1941 and the threat is real). The interchange between Douglas and Sheen overcomes the gaps in the plot (""so we pass through some weird storm and presto, now we're so much more clever than Mr. Einstein?"") while a subplot involving Charles Durning as a Senator slated to run with FDR on the ticket that sent to Truman to the Whitehouse reminds us how malleable history really is. (If Durning survives, will he helm America on FDR's death, and make the decision to confront Stalin and nuke Japan?). At the heart of FC is the science-fiction/mystery aspect (how did a tear in the space-time continuum open up just where the ship would be and manage to deposit it precisely on the eve of the Pearl attack?), but the direction of the film (which concentrates on the nuts and bolts of running a nuclear aircraft carrier) swamps the mystery. It isn't until the last minute when the script offers us a mammoth twist that we realize we've been watching a sci-fi film, not just some film version of a Clancy novel. (The novelization by Martin Caidin gives this more attention). The last frame is cryptic (I know everybody's seen it, but why should I spoil the fun?) but still leaves me with chills. Years later, I still get a rush when I hear Kirk Douglas call out ""Splash the Zeroes"".",1063497600,5,3324,4.703259005145798

After years of, and then some more months, waiting for Pacific Family Entertainment to release, what they call, the DVD, I am utterly furious as to the result.

PFE is releasing it again... only this time, supposedly, the video quality is going to be improved, however it will not be 16x9 enhanced. The sound might be remixed, but lets face it folks... it will probably be the same horrible quality as was before. We might be given the gift of chapter selection, but who knows.

Their last release of The Final Countdown DVD was ranked one of, if not the worst DVDs ever manufactuered by a company. They charged $... a pop and it should have only been worth about $... Now they are re-releasing it again at probably about $... a pop. So beware.
One suggestion I am making to those who have already bought the last release... Call them up and demand an exchange! I'm going to!

The modern-day nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz
(an Atlantic Fleet-based aircraft carrier)stationed at Pearl Harbor goes through a mysterious electrical storm in the Pacific Ocean, the crew (Kirk Douglas, Captain; James Farentino, Airwing Commander; Ron O'Neal, XO) & a cilvilian advisor (Martin Sheen)
soon realize through a series of events that they have gone back in time to December 6, 1941, the day before the attack on Pearl Harbor!
After rescuing survivors of a yacht blown up by Japanese Zeros, the crew of the Nimitz is faced with a decision that would change the course of history...whether they should destroy the Japanese Fleet BEFORE they attack Pearl Harbor.
For those of you who've seen the movie, you know the ending.
For those who've never seen ""Final Countdown"", I won't ruin what is a great ending!
I've been waiting for years for ""Final Countdown"" to come out on DVD. Hopefully it will be loaded with extra features never found on the rare VHS version from Vestron.

419116,1,6302010306,"This is and has been one of my favorite movies since I saw it in the theater back in '80. It has a good mix of science fiction and military realism that just isn't found in similar movies of the same genre... The movie begins eerily with the departure of the largest nuclear powered aircraft carrier from the Naval dock at Pearl Harbor. Shortly thereafter, the ship and crew encounter an electrical storm that paralyzes the operations on board the ship. Once passed through, they find themselves, (through process of elimination), on the eve of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Captain, (convincingly played by Kirk Douglas), and senior officers have to decide to make a decision as to whether to attack the Japanese fleet or let history run its course- -that is all I will say-notwithstanding a well chosen twist ending however. As far as my opinion of the acting is concerned, I disagree with the previous reviews that Kirk Douglas and Martin Sheen played down their respective roles- -anything otherwise would have resulted in the typical sci-fi OVERacting that plagues many of the same type of movies save for the special effects of the day; which in any era, quickly become outdated. (Luckily, this movie was made before the rampant overuse of CGI.)
All of that said, their inflection and dialog is dead on: Captain Yelland's humorous dismay of ""two WHAT?!"" when he receives a report of the two Japanese Zeros seen by the ships recon. F-14's...very fitting.
On to the DVD: It is the worst transfer for public sale I have seen to date-period. In my technical opinion, it is a dupe from ANOTHER REGION DVD (PAL to NTSC).

LD's are capable of nearly the same picture quality as a DVD and in some cases actually better- -The Final Countdown is no exception in both image and sound quality (which is in two track digital). The only benefit this DVD has is letterboxing-(there was never a letterboxed LD.) This Region 1 DVD is awful in every respect.

419119,2,6302010306,"I concur with the other reviewer, The Final Countdown is one of the most underrated military dramas. It combines a terrific cast (Kirk Douglas, Martin Sheen, Charles Durning, Katherine Ross, James Farentino & the entire actual crew of the U.S.S. Nimitiz), tight, fast-paced action, an eerie score, great science fiction and a twisted ending. Only 93 minutes long, but every moment counts.
Sadly, this DVD appears to be nothing more than a transfer from the long-since out-of-production laserdisc. And a poor transfer at that! I wouldn't be surprised if it was done with either home or the most basic professional equipment. The transfer is dull and uninspired as is the sound. Since they presumedly transferred from the LD, at least the 2.35:1 screen ratio was preserved. They certainly did not go back to any original source.
That being said, it's the only choice you've got and is superior to the VHS copies floating around and more convenient than the scattered LD versions. Also, the people at Pacific Family Entertainment (who own the rights to the film) sent out a copy in very quick fashion. My guess is that someone at PFE was a big Final Countdown fan and decided to make the DVD happen even if they couldn't do it properly.

I'm happy that the movie was released in widescreen, in fact, it has the approx screen ratio as ""Ben Hur"" which I enjoyed. My only downfall for the dvd is the lack of all the special features I have come accustomed to with dvd's. The picture is somewhat grainy and unsharp, like it had been mastered from a vhs tape or laserdisc master. On the other hand, after adjusting television settings, I was able to clean the picture up.

419124,3,6302010306,"Few film genres generate as much suspense and controversy as  time travel stories.  Most of them face the consequences of how a change in the past may cause a change in the future.  Since physicists can't seem to agree about anything concerning time travel, then they shouldn't be too quick to point an accusing finger at Hollywood when it decides to add its own flavor to a decidedly mixed cinematic pot.  THE FINAL COUNTDOWN is director Don Taylor's 1980 attempt to tell a stirring story using time travel as a backdrop.  For the most part, and except for a minor inspirational deflation at the very end, he succeeds.
  The premise is of a 1980 American aircraft carrier caught in a swirling ripple of temporal dislocation and whisked back to the early morning of December 7, 1941, with the Japanese attack only a few hours away.  The captain, played sternly by Kirk Douglas, refuses to accept such obvious clues as radio broadcasts by Jack Benny, photographs of a pre-attack Pearl Harbor taken by his own reconaissance jets, and his inability to raise Washington on any radio band.  One of his subordinates, a CIA type played by Martin Sheen, hints broadly that he knows the truth, but he keeps it to himself until he can be sure.  This surety comes in a Japanese strafing of a civilian pleasure craft containing a genuine 1941 politician.  As the zeros zoom in for the kill, it is only then that the Captain is convinced.  The crux of the movie lies in his uncertainty that he should destroy the Japanese fleet before it attacks Pearl.  If he does not attack, thousands of Americans will (have already?) die.  If he does attack to prevent the morning assault, how then can he remember a surprise attack by the Japanese that never happened?
  The movie raises some necessary questions about duty versus fear of the unknown, and the movie ends in the only way that does not violate iron rules of causality.  Just as the Captain orders his jets aloft to blast the Japanese carriers, the same swirling storm that yanked his ship back to 1941 appears for a second time to snatch it right back, thus preserving history As It Officially Is.  To director Taylor's credit, he resists what would have been a hugely satisfying temptation to destroy the enemy carriers.  Logic is preserved over potential audience enjoyment.  This sort of fidelity to science is at once laudable and distressing, and that perhaps is the inner message of this movie: in the entertainment business, you can't always have it both ways.",1025222400,3,2507,4.745958429561201

419172,5,6302010306,"The Final Countdown is one, if not the best movie of its type that I have ever seen. As a former U.S. Navy sailor I was impressed by the realism. Most of the action takes place aboard an aircraft carrier and having been at sea on an aircraft carrier I can tell you that not only are the sights right, but the sound are right, what you hear in the background is very real. The flying scenes were so good as to be hard to believe, and the whole concept of the story grabs the immagination like nothing else can. The concept of a fully armed modern aircraft carrier dropping out of time into the ocean just off of Hawaii, just before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor is mind boggling and when you throw in questions like; ""can we attack first, because we know from history (that will be changed) that the Japanese are going to attack?"" ""and if we do, will we have started the war?"" ""Who has authority over this future aircraft carrier, is it the 1941 president?"" Immagine an arial dogfight between an Japanese Zero and a Tomcat... you get see one.
Everything about The Final Countdown is well done and above and beyond expectations.

It proudly (with a great musical score) depicts the power of the modern U.S. Navy (of 1980...11 years prior to the Gulf War and 22 years ago) against an ancient (almost 19th century-like adversary).
If a misplaced-in-time U.S.S. Nimitz had destroyed the Japanese expeditionary fleet, including all their planes and carriers, on their way to a Pearl Harbor attack...what might the implications be?  Good or not good for the USA?  I believe that the answer isn't so obvious.  The story of the CAG's life makes the movie truly compelling.

Off the coast of Hawaii, the modern day USS Nimitz encounters a bizarre storm, which is actually a portal through time.  The crew gradually becomes convinced that they have emerged in 1941 just prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor -- and that they have the futuristic firepower to stop it.  But can history really be changed?  Initially, it seems likely!  In the highlight scene of the film, F-14 Tomcats go to the rescue of a yacht under attack by Zeros.  Survivors, a suspicious Congressman and his assistant, as well as an incredulous Japanese pilot, are brought on board the spectacularly anachronistic aircraft carrier.  From there, the mission to change history begins to go awry as paradox-producing events occur.  Nonetheless, the Nimitz never falters.  And you really anticipate, even as the time portal begins to close, that her guns and aircraft will engage the oncoming enemy.  ""The Final Countdown"" is a wonderful fantasy, very realistically enacted.  For a time-travel epic, I like the way all the ""loose ends"" are neatly tied up.

419228,5,6302010306,"The only version of The Final Countdown I have seen was on Channel 5 a few years ago. Though it was probably edited for content and for time, I still liked it. So I hope that Amazon.com will re-release it on VHS so I can see the full version.
The modern day (1980) aircraft carrier U.S.S Nimitz goes back in time to December 6, 1941, the day before the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor. The crew of the Nimitz encounters many adventures before they travel back to the present. The best part of the film is when a pair of F-14 Tomcats destroy two Japanese zeroes (My dad compared it to Mosquitoes against flies). This all leads up to the climax of should the Nimitz, with her overwhelming firepower, change history? Or should history not be tampered with? It also makes us wonder as to what would we do if we were put in that situation. Many fine performances are given throughout. Especially good are Martin Sheen and Kirk Douglas, all at the peek of their careers.",986688000,26,961,4.465909090909091
419229,4,6302010306,"The ""what-if"" story is compelling, but it is totally overshadowed by the amazing firepower of the airwing of a nuclear powered aircraft carrier. One can stay with this one until the end, but a somewhat frayed ending may leave you puzzled. Overall, a good sci-fi/military movie. Incidentally, I was a crew member on the Nimitz when The Final Countdown was being filmed, and was edited out of two scenes. It's a shame this one is out of print.",981417600,5,441,4.666666666666667
419240,5,6302010306,I have watched this movie MANY times on TV (whenever it runs).  I absolutely love it.  The movie is extremely well acted and really makes you think.  I recently got a DVD player and was very dismayed to find one of my all time favorite movies not available!  PLEASE (whoever the force is controlling this) release Final Countdown on DVD.,980899200,14,337,4.566666666666666
419241,5,6302010306,"I saw the Final Countdown when it hit the theaters in 1970, this was the best film having to do with the U.S. Navy and its truly amazing aircraft and the coordination it takes to make these things work. I would have still enjoyed this movie even if it weren't a sci-fi flick. The flying scenes of taking off and landing on an aircraft carrier are just fantastic in them selves. I have been hoping for this movie to be released again because I've worn out my first purchased VHS tape. I hope to see F.C. to be released on DVD soon!  Great movie!",980812800,3,544,4.230769230769231
419242,4,6302010306,"This movie is very well photographed,(especially the aerial scenes showing the awesome tehnological advances in aviation since the 40s which we take so much for granted.)It is a movie in which at the end the viewer cannot mentally come to grips with all the ""if-onlys"". What would be the ultimate effect of changing history after the fact? The actors' performances, while good, were really secondary to the being treated to period aircraft trying to engage modern-day jet fighters. Soon-Tek-Oh, a very fine actor, gave a good performance as a downed Japanese pilot. The only weak point I found in the movie was the almost antiseptic attitude of the Aircraft Carrier crew towards the Japanese fleet which they know is about to sneak attack and kill more than a thousand sailors which starts a war which will kill hundreds of thousands of men,women and childen before its end. Overall, it makes you think. There are no easy answers to the questions posed in this movie. But, you will enjoy it.",980121600,3,991,4.8698224852071
419243,5,6302010306,"I suppose if one could go back in time, this is the way it would happen. An extremely gripping movie that I could watch (and have watched) many times. What would you do if you could change history? Would you? Or would you let it run it's course? When a movie makes you continuously think about it over and over, to me that's the sign of a well made and well written movie. And the O. Henry ending will make your head spin! Now, why in the world would this movie NOT be available in any way, shape, or form? To me, this would be a MUST HAVE on DVD. OK, powers that be, bring this movie back in all its time travel glory!",976406400,14,619,4.0
419244,5,6302010306,"This film is well written, has an all star cast and has wonderful photography. Filmed well before Top Gun, The Final Countdown has great areial combat/flight scenes and shows the awesome capabilites of the navy's modern nuclear aircraft carriers and the stressful environment that all aboard have to live with every day.
Kirk Douglass and Marten Sheen show why they were ""A"" list actors when this film was made. Both gave excellent performances.
The script was well written with the exploration of the ships crew trying to deal with a potential paradox that would effect every person on the planet.
Great acting a good story and super photography of aircraft carrier and flight operations. If you like these features, you will love this movie.",973036800,105,743,5.0
