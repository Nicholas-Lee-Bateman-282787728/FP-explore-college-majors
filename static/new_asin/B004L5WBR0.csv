8433898,5,B004L5WBR0,"After ordering Basketball Smorgasboard by Tom Izzo, I wanted to get his All-Access DVDs. Coach Izzo is a basketball genius and the art of running a practice is part of what you will get out of this amazing DVD set.  He is the master of ""misdirection"" plays. We have adopted some of his stretches & warmups too!

Just last week, we had a conference game and the opposing point guard called out ""Izzo!""  Our players instantly recognized what play they were running...we call it Spartan!  He has great out-of-bounds plays, half court sets...and great insights that he voices while teaching them, as well as when he is teaching the drills.  There is so much you will pick up.  I have also attended one of his clinics and this All Access set is even better, because you can replay everything and take notes as you go. You can refer back to it again, after a practice, if things didn't work out on the court during your practice...kind of allows you to re-analyze everything!

Hopefully, not too many of my opponents will buy this DVD...I'll have to change my plays!!!",1387152000,,1062,4.617021276595745
