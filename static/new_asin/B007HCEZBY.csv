8516588,5,B007HCEZBY,"A few years ago I had a really bad fall and ended up with compression fractures in all five Lumbar vertebrae and a plug of bone punched out of my skull.  My sole physical therapy was Wild Goose Qigong 1st 64.  Within 6 weeks I had recovered full range of motion and could do a standing forward fold and touch my toes, even while still in my back brace!

That's what it did for me.  What will it do for you?

Thank you, Shane Lear & David Deich!",1526342400,,444,4.0

8516591,5,B007HCEZBY,"I have a few books on the subject and this is probably the best written. It doesn't always follow the DVD that goes with the book. When it differs, I fall back on the DVD. The drawings are very helpful in learning the form. The list of acupoints used in the system is also very helpful. I give it top rating.",1481500800,,308,4.065573770491803

8516594,5,B007HCEZBY,"Having practiced several systems of Qigong and I can personally say the Wild Goose System is by far the most powerful qigong I have ever had the opportunity to learn.  This DVD is presented in a very detailed manner, broken into easy to learn segments. Most importantly, Shane Lear's movements are more exact than any other Wild Goose DVD series I have seen.  I practice both the 1st and 2nd 64 forms every morning and can see a drastic difference in my overall health and well-being.",1351900800,6,484,4.616279069767442
