2772351,4,B000NO240C,"Too much stuff on global warming makes me sad.  It doesn't make me want to work for change; it gives me the impression that there is nothing that could be done to reverse things.  I love when environmental discussion give suggestions and not just doomsaying.  This is that type of work.

This documentary goes into using algae and others things to reduce greenhouse gases.  It also shows that humans can do things to get rid of land dumps and toxic waste.  No one hates science classes more than me, so I'm glad non-techies could understand this discussion.  I heard that there is now an AP Environmental Science class in high schools.  Perhaps teachers could show this documentary on the first day of that class.

This work is diverse in terms of geography:  it gave good news about New York City and not just the deserts in Arizona.  However, the interviewees were not diverse.  There were two women and no people of color interviewed.  My guess is that environmental action would be improved if more diverse groups were involved in it.",1228867200,4,1038,4.7
2772352,5,B000NO240C,"""Dams"" begins with an overview of the massive ""Three Gorges Dam"" in China (including statistics), then moves on to a brief history of dams and their early uses, moving quickly to today's dams.

Everything about dams is impressive - their size, enormity of construction effort, and (if appropriate) their generating power.  Benefits include making rivers navigable, controlling floods, storing water to even the flow out, and generating power.  Problems include negative impact on fish (counteracted somewhat with fish ladders, barging, hollow turbine blades to aerate downstream water), and the possibility of dam failure.

""Dams"" ends with the new development of taking small damns out of existence - restoring flood plains and improving life for river species of fish.",1217462400,,770,5.5
2772353,3,B000NO240C,"This work is not just about construction.  It has distinct chapters, including welding by sound, underwater welding, and welding by robots.  This may be a good tool for shop classes or some science classes.  Boys and tomboys who want to become architects or engineers may love it.
The work shows exciting 3-D graphics.  It provides spellings and definitions for terms that will expand your vocabulary.
There is only one woman interviewed here and no people of color are interviewed.  Thus, it is not a diverse work.  Still, welding may sound boring, but this program was pretty entertaining and informative.",1196640000,4,607,5.08080808080808
2772354,2,B000NO240C,"This work starts and ends with the future of military gear.  I think this is meant to draw in and keep the viewer who doesn't really care about the history of this gear.

This was informative.  I learned that the mane-like attachment on Ancient Greek outfits served no practical purpose (not even for swatting flies?).  The work tells why knight's armor rose and fell out of use.

It makes sense that canons aren't mentioned as they are not ""gear.""  Still, as this work focused more on weapons than on clothing, it did seem like there was an absence.  The work cites the French in World War I for making metal helmets.  What about the pointy hats worn by Prussians in the century before?  Even ""The Simpsons"" honored and mocked that.

The dove in me wonders how the hawks who would be lured to see this will respond.  The models hired to recreate images could have been like those Civil War imitators:  you could tell they love playing make-believe.  One Roman soldier was seen with a full beard and I learned in history classes that Romans viewed beards are barbaric or uncivilized.  Students who do creative anachronism may love this work too.  Since I'm not a war enthusiast, I have fears about this being a tool for military recruitment.  No matter how advanced military gear gets, let's hope that the numbers and extents of wars can decrease.  I worry that not all viewers will agree with that, unfortunately.",1181001600,2,1414,4.659919028340081
2772375,5,B000NO240C,"Great informative movie for a welding enthusiast, I show this video if I have to be gone for a day in the welding class I teach at the middle school level. Great coverage of just how important/prevalent welding is in our modern society.",1386374400,,236,4.511627906976744
2772376,5,B000NO240C,"I bought these videos to share with my fifth grade students.  I have used them when we are studying the industrialization period of our U.S. history, career information, and to answer the question, ""How are they using math?""  My students LOVE them.  And happy students equates to a happy teacher.",1384300800,2,296,4.88
2772377,5,B000NO240C,Great stuff for getting young people interested in welding.  Good place to start for career exploration.  Nice basic explanations for the beginner.,1374105600,,147,5.636363636363637
2772378,5,B000NO240C,"I bought these for my 8th grade students and they absolutely love the videos.  They are quite interesting and kept them intrigued the entire time.  If you are looking for videos to play during testing or supplemental videos for your subject, math especially, these are worth the purchase.",1367280000,2,288,4.979166666666667
2772379,5,B000NO240C,"The Egyptians forged welded iron and bronze items found near pyramids around 1000 B.C. - the metals were hammered together at high temperatures. Electric arc welding produces temperatures of 6 - 8,000 degrees, melting steel; first done in 1890. Such welds are now shielded from air via a coating emitted from the welding rods. Eye protection is required. Rivets were king of construction building until the 1940s - did not have as much load-bearing strength as today's welds, hence the number of support beams required was much greater than now. Large beam welds can require hours involving a team of workers.

Explosion welding (CLAD) can join any type of metals - was developed after noting in WWI and WWII that shrapnel sometimes stuck to armor. The thinner plate is placed on top, a frame placed around the edges about 3 - 5 inches high, and the 'pit' filled with explosives. Dust created inside tunnels used for this process requires 18 hours to clear before entry is possible. The output is then heated, rolled or pressed, and tested. Used for situations involving higher temperatures and pressures, such as found at refineries.

Underwater welding uses electric arc techniques. Needed for pipelines, offshore platforms. Flux from the welding rods protects the surface from water immediately after the weld. Dry welding underwater requires a shell to keep the air out, divers need to spend long periods in pressure chambers between work to make the process economical.

Cars contain about 5,000 spot welds, mostly accomplished through robots. About 10,000 amps is used, and the welding equipment weighs 100 - 200 lbs; accomplished much faster through robots.

Plastic is welded through friction - often uses ultrasound-created vibrations to create the heat. 'Spin welding' is utilized to create the heat to join the components for insulated cups.",1364428800,,1852,5.163333333333333
2772380,5,B000NO240C,"The DVD on Modern Marvels: Welding that I received is just what I had been expecting. I am able to play it on the television set as well as the laptop, and I can even do it with closed captioning. Fantastic!",1363737600,,207,4.073170731707317
2772381,5,B000NO240C,Excellent movie on different types of welding. Not an instruction or how to movie. Briefly covers several types of welding as kind of an intro to the different types. Gives brief history and background. I never realized the subject of welding was so vast and used in so many different applications. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in learning how and where welding is used and maybe as a brief intro to teens who might be thinking of becoming welders. Excellent info in this movie. Enjoyed it very much.,1360540800,,511,4.752808988764045
2772382,5,B000NO240C,Sent it as a gift and he thoroughly enjoyed it! Very big modern marvels fan and i think hell watch it over and over,1356652800,,115,3.8333333333333335

2772384,5,B000NO240C,"History Channel does a wonderful job on their DVD's/shows on T.V.  Even if you are not into Welding, you will find this interesting, I promise that.  You get a better understanding of how things get put together. Structures and even to the plastic items you buy (that's towards the end  ;-P)",1348704000,,291,4.666666666666667
2772405,5,B000NO240C,Great movie about green technology and sustainable architecture featuring some buildings in NYC and elsewhere.  One of the better movies I've shown my middle school technology class.,1332115200,,182,5.7407407407407405

2772407,4,B000NO240C,"I teach jr. high technology and it's nice to have decently produced movies to have students watch in case of a sub or to fill a gap or any other reason. This collection offers an excellent value for high-quality videos. Just because they're educational videos doesn't mean they need to be boring. This collection of Modern Marvels successfully captures the excitement of the technology itself to keep kids (and myself!) interested.

The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the selection seems a little random. If you're going to make a collection, ideally it would cover what would be the most pertinent topics, not random things like monster trucks or candy. But it's cheap enough that it's a minor qualm.",1295913600,7,710,4.819672131147541
2772408,5,B000NO240C,"Anyone who loves History and Technology will love these videos.  Actually, even if you don't enjoy history, you still will love these videos.  Very well put together with a nice mix of history and today's times.  Great for all ages.  Our favorite is the video of candy manufacturing.  They are all educational and interesting.",1294790400,,326,4.962962962962963
2772409,5,B000NO240C,"I purchased this video to research the history of welding for a book I am working on. Not only was the video comprehensive, it was fascinating. You will come away with an appreciation of how welding and modern life are inseperable.",1292544000,,231,4.658536585365853

2772414,3,B000NO240C,"I thought the Modern Marvels - Welding DVD was informative. I wish more time was spent on the history and theory of welding. I would have liked to have seen better coverage of gas welding, MIG and TIG welding and plasma cutting. An artists uses of modern welding is a suggested supplement.",1237766400,2,289,4.576923076923077

8179468,4,B000NO240C,"Chapters include skyscraper construction welding, underwater welding, explosive welding (fusing together of metal sheets with explosive charges), spot welding robots in auto manufacturing, and ultrasonic welding of plastics in manufacturing (including those all-so-exasperating plastic packages for retail merchandise).

As usual with the Modern Marvels presentations, each segment supplies interesting historical background and explanations of the subject. The first segment showed how the beams of buildings were fastened with rivets before construction welding was developed  by Lincoln Electric in the first decades of the 20th century. How the welds are protected from atmospheric gases is explained. The segment on robotic welding showed how the robot is programmed and how it senses where to place each weld. I liked the way the supervisor of the underwater welding station explained that everything inside has to be kept extremely organized because space is so tight and ""there's alot of things in there that can bite you"". Very informative.

Only thing I would have liked to have been included would be shipyard welding (especially submarines with their special steels (even titanium)) and the welding for the pipes in nuclear power plants (carrying radioactive water -- those welds have to be x-rayed to pass inspection).",1490659200,,1331,5.678391959798995

8179471,5,B000NO240C,"Modern Marvels:  Battle Gear is a concise and informative survey of arms and armor over the centuries.  The opening segments of the documentary show the various types of battle gear used by modern soldiers.  Then, we go back in time and learn about shields, bows and arrows, the Egyptians and chariots, Greek hoplites, Roman centurions, knights and armor in the Middle Ages, the development of firearms, machine guns, helmets, World Wars I and II, weapons and body armor used in Vietnam, Kevlar, the Persian Gulf War, MREs, and the soldier of the future.  The segment on the soldier of the future posits that future uniforms will be climate controlled and will have the ability to adjust camouflage with surrounding areas; munitions will also have the ability to distinguish between friend and foe.  This is a well done documentary but fails to mention the significance of cone shaped bullets and rifled guns during the American Civil War.  It also does not discuss gas masks as used during World War I.  Still, this is an entertaining yet informative video ideal for anyone interested in a succinct fifty minute overview of the history of arms and armor.",1460764800,,1155,4.922680412371134
