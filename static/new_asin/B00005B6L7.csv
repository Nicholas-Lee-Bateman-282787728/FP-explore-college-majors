1420901,5,B00005B6L7,"I thought that this film was very heartwarming. A young girl loses her father when she is four years old. Her mother obviously distraught was left to care for her alone, with the help of her mother and some friends. The little girl loved mermaids. Because the little girl didn't understand where her father had gone, her grandmother told her that she could write a letter to him, which they attached to a balloon. the balloon floated away and landed by a lake known as Mermaid lake in Mermaid City. A hunter found the letter and took it home, showed it to his family and decided to write back. The little girl recieved the letter later on and went to visit this family. They became firm friends. Meanwhile the mother became quite close to an old friend, whihc may have turned into a romance.
Overall i loved this film it was very sad but had a nice ending and was based on a true story.",1012867200,19,886,4.375757575757576
1420902,4,B00005B6L7,"I wasn't sure what to expect at first viewing of this, but I was hopeful considering that Ellen Burstyn has habit of being in rather excellent movies. This definately is another success.
It's a simple story about a Rhonda and her daughter who loses her husband and they both hold in their grief so deeply they become emotionally paralyzed. Rhonda's mother (Ellen Burstyn) comes up with the idea to send a letter to the little girl Desi's dad up in Heaven tied to a mermaid balloon which mysteriously ends up thousands of miles away in a town called Mermaid in Canada. This incredible event changes Desi and Rhonda's life forever.
Now mind you I am not a person who is prone to crying at movies but this one touched me so deeply I couldn't help myself. I never expected to be so profoundly moved by this little film, but it was just so beautiful and heartfelt. The fact that this is based on a true story only adds to it's impact. This is a great movie for anyone young or old. Just have some tissues nearby it's a real tear jerker.",1001030400,9,1031,4.403141361256544
1420903,4,B00005B6L7,"The only mermaids in the TV-movie are the ones on the balloon and in the book, but the story is based on a real event.
Very loosely modeled on Hans Christian Andersen's original ""The Little Mermaid"" (not the Disney version), the film depicts in fanciful fashion the attempt of a small girl to communicate with her dead father in heaven by attaching a note to a balloon with a mermaid pictured on it. The balloon is carried on the wind from California to St. Edward's Island in Canada, and the people who find it respond to the girl's message. The cast is well-chosen and the film is touching without being mawkish.
It is pleasant to imagine that mermaids and angels exist in the light beyond death.",986515200,8,698,4.5476190476190474

1420913,5,B00005B6L7,"I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Mermaid was really clean and based on a true story. There was a few utterances of mild crude language and the story is about a child not understanding that her father has died.  It is not rated and the Dove Foundation gave it a four star and approved it for all ages.

I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely watch it again.  A family member recommended it and then I just had to buy the DVD.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"".

I loved all the characters, especially the little girl, Desi.  Through the whole show she refers to herself in the third person because she is trying to put herself out of her pain and fear after her father's death.  Even thinking that he left her because she was naughty.  Her family has a difficult time trying to tell her that her father is gone and not coming back and both Desi and her mom have a hard time letting go and moving on.  The fact that when Desi sends a letter to her dad, attached to a Mermaid balloon, and that it makes it 4,000 miles to Mermaid, Canada where a kind family answers the letter is very touching.  Saying that since her dad knew he couldn't answer it himself, he sent it to someone who would do it for him to remind Desi that her dad didn't forget about her.  Desi and her Mom then travel to Mermaid, Canada to visit the kind family who helped them to find peace and happiness again.  At the end of the movie the real Desi and her family are seen on the film location and discuss the making of the movie.

Overall, I loved this movie and will watch it again and again.",1369785600,3,1773,4.179411764705883
1420914,5,B00005B6L7,"Great movie, good for family. Is not full of junk like most movies, has a good message and is a cute story. Its good to be able to sit down and watch a movie and not have to shut it off in the middle because of all the trash.",1362960000,2,225,3.6122448979591835
1420915,5,B00005B6L7,"Although this show brings tears to your eyes, it is a wonderful show.  You watch a family deal with the death of the father, explaining his death as simply as possible for a very young child to understand.  Anyone who has lost a close family member will find this very therapeutic.  Anyone else watching it might find it very helpful in their relationship with others who are going through a similiar situation.  It is a must see movie for those who love people and want to be able to put into words those feelings you just can't express otherwise.",1252800000,,548,4.505050505050505
1420916,5,B00005B6L7,I love stories that are based on true events and show the real charactors at the end. The movie is very touching but also shows there is a God who knows the hearts of children and cares about their understanding of Him and that He hears and answers prayers. My grandson who just turned 5yrs. old watched it with me and when his daddy came home from work he told the whole story with excitement! Thankyou for making it available.,1240012800,,428,4.3625
1420917,5,B00005B6L7,"This is a great movie, and a tear jerker!  It is based on a true story about a five year old girl whose dad dies and she writes him a letter in heaven, which then gets found by a family living in a place called ""Mermaid!""

It is well acted, and the little girl who plays the title role is just great in it!",1208736000,2,306,3.765625
1420918,3,B00005B6L7,"This film is based on a true story. Grieving Desi (Jodelle Ferland) is not coping well with the death of her dad. Emotionally dissociated (she refers to herself in the third person), she asks incessant questions: where is her father, and when can she talk to him. Desi's mom Rhonda (Samantha Mathis), losing the house she had built with her now-deceased husband, takes the little girl and moves in with her mother Trish (Ellen Burstyn). Rhonda remains stoic, despite Trish's attempts to get her to cry, and act on her romantic interest in a man (David Kaye) who likes her too. Both Grandma and Mom are worried about Desi, who has become so self-destructive, she locks herself in the bathroom and slashes off some hair, and wanders in a field at night dangerously near a thresher.

As Desi continues to be unmanageable and slips into a fantasy world, Rhonda has her send her father a letter, propelled skyward tied to a helium-filled balloon. In several days, the message reaches Prince Edward Island from California. The Canadian family who finds the letter writes back. They also send Desi a gift for her fifth birthday, explaining that since there are no stores in heaven, her father asked them to send the gift for him. After receiving the package from Canada, Desi's wounds are magically healed and she no longer refers to herself in the third person. After the extraordinary tale makes it into the newspapers, readers spontaneously send the destitute family money for airfare, Rhonda takes Desi to Canada to visit the family, and everyone relaxes and is happy again.

What might have been a really good film fails in almost all areas. Most of the acting is wooden. While visually cute, Desi speaks her many lines with no discernible emotion, soul or substance, and with an incessantly high-pitched, whiny voice that tires the ear. Samantha Mathis, who was excellent in A Stranger's Heart, plays Rhonda with an inscrutable face and you never quite get a sense of what she's really going through. The only good acting is from Ellen Burstyn, whose character has great believability and depth, and David Kaye, who manages to convey a lot without saying much. But even their acting cannot save this poorly written movie. The family's problems are tortuously dragged out: Desi's mentally ill antics, which dominate over an hour of the 90-minute film, should have been whittled down to 25 minutes.

One coy plot manipulation is especially over the top: Blu Mankuma, a very good actor, is placed in various roles (graveyard attendant, ice cream man, balloon seller, postman), apparently to convey the idea that an ""angel"" is present. But there's no need for such contrivance. The true story would have carried this movie very nicely, in its own right--if only the writer and director hadn't piled on the schmaltz.

The best part of the film is the end, when we see the real California and Canadian families. (Unfortunately, one must strain to see their faces through the credits.) Desi is now a teenager, shown interacting with Jodelle--who, when she spontaneously talks, appears much more intelligent and vital than the character she portrayed. The real mother and grandmother project enormous presence and heart, and the Canadian couple likewise project great heart. It's really too bad that no documentary was made of these families; it would have been infinitely more interesting than the film itself. Showing the real families brought this 2 star movie up to 3 stars.

Why does Hollywood feel that it must embellish what can stand on its own merits? From other sites, it appears that Rhonda and her ex-husband had been divorced, and that he had then committed suicide. If you want to read the ""lite"" version of the story behind this tear-jerking tale, it's in one of the ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" books, written by Margo Pfeiff.",1208044800,3,3832,4.916537867078826

1420922,4,B00005B6L7,"This is a movie about a little girl who lost her father. The little girl was so sad that she wrote a letter to her father and attached it to a balloon. She then let go of the balloon and sent it up to heaven, to deliver the letter to her father.

It is based on a true story. The story is mostly true, the actual girl did send a balloon in to the sky , with a letter attached to her father. The letter was really answered by someone from far away.

I wish that the movie would have given the viewer more information about her father, Ken Gill, who was a personal friend of mine. He loved the little girl very much, but was going through some very troubling times with his ex-wife Rhonda. It was then that he took his own life. He is sadly missed by all who knew him. I think of him often, especially when this movie comes on. It has been many years since this has happened....

His daughter has my heart felt sympathy. I am sad that she will not have the opportunity to know how much her father loved her. The movie is a sweet remembrance of his memory.",1134000000,2,1053,4.052884615384615

1420924,5,B00005B6L7,"I am the founder of a grief center and I saw this movie for the first time today. This movie, because based on a true story, shows the extreme struggles of a family moving through the grief journey (and that is what it is - a journey).  I am glad Showtime took the time to make it! It is very hard for small children to understand the permanent aspect of death.  It is a lovely story that helps a 4 year old understand death, grief and find a place for hope and love in her heart. Children greive and it is very hard for loved ones to be honest with children about death, because no one wants children to hurt.  Try your best!  Many mystical things happen after someone dies if you open your ears and heart to hear the ""Mermaids"".",1126396800,4,730,4.156028368794326

Desi is a five-year-old girl who has become inconsolable after the death of her father. Desi's mother, Rhonda, isn't sure what to do for her troubled daughter and when the girl tells her mother she wants to write her father a last letter and attach it to a balloon so it will be carried to heaven, Rhonda agrees it's a good idea. Desi and Rhonda send out the balloon, which is carried by the winds to a small community known as Mermaid. There, a man named Wade MacKinnon finds the balloon, with the letter attached. After reading the message, Wade and his family decide to answer the letter, as if their missive had been written by Desi's late father.

The death of her father has put a 5-year-old girl into such shock that she refers to herself in the third person.  She believes her father doesn't come home because she has done something bad and he won't forgive her.  (The portrayal of this child by the child actress is nothing short of amazing.)  How she is cured and the kindness shown to her, not just by those around her and by a distant family, but by the public at large is one of the most moving sequences on film.  If you're not into human kindness or refuse to believe it exists, stay away from this film.
