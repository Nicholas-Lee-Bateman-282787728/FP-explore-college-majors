3984435,5,B002TCRQRC,"An evil unscrupulous millionaire (Berton Churchill as Caesar Kluck), with the eye for the ladies, steps on far too many toes and gains a legion of possible suspects when he keels over deader than dead..............MURDERED!!!  Who could have done it (and how did they do it) becomes the main focus of this mystery.  Amazingly, nary a cop puts in an appearance in this movie.  All the sleuthing is done by a radio engineer (Donald Woods as Benjamin Butts).  He is assisted by one of the prime suspects (Nan Grey as Steenie MacCorkle).  It doesn't help them in their sleuthing when the head of the radio company wants to cover it up and claim that Kluck died of natural causes, like heart failure.  He's helped in this deceit by a dubious doctor (Edward Van Sloan).  As a backup plan, they're more than willing to frame Steenie MacCorkle if Butts continues to claim it was MURDER!!!

This is actually quite fun.  I was pleasantly surprised with how well it was done.  Besides Edward Van Sloan, Lee J. Cobb also puts in an appearance as a possible suspect.  Yes, the transfer is less than perfect but expected for a film of this age (1938).  I'm more than happy to add it to my collection.",1434931200,2,1186,4.568720379146919

3984440,5,B002TCRQRC,"I have to add another 5 stars to this little gem. Although the actors are mostly unknown now, except for Lee J. Cobb who does a nice character actor turn, I enjoyed the chemistry between all the cast. I am becoming a collector of these 'B' movies - a good hour's worth of fun. Another plus is the work the writer's did in those days to find a new way to murder someone. I really enjoyed this one.",1386201600,4,396,4.089743589743589
3984441,3,B002TCRQRC,I like old movies and enjoy many black and white ones. I like mysteries too. However I found this combination of these three elements. To be so unexceptional. That had I been in a cinema I would have gone to the concession stand for some excitement. As I was at home I just dozed off.,1372896000,,284,4.181818181818182

3984444,5,B002TCRQRC,"""This is the 20th century, mister, and I don't believe in your phantom of radio forum killer."" - Steenie to Benjamin

This topflight ""B"" mystery is a fantastic little gem that will appeal to fans of ""B"" mysteries and fans of old radio. An excellent cast, nifty story, and unusually good sets and direction for a low budget programmer, make for a very fun time at the movies. Fans of Three Smart Girls with Deanna Durbin get a chance to see Nan Grey who is adorable and quite fetching here. Donald Woods is excellent opposite Grey, with William Lundigan a standout in a small but pivotal role as the radio announcer. Lind Hayes nearly steals the show as the aspiring call boy with many voices who finally gets his chance.

Everything about this ""B"" mystery is just a cut above the norm, beginning with a fine adaptation of Xantippe's novel, Death Catches Up With Mr. Kluck, by screenwriters Betty Laidlaw and Robert Lively. Producer Irving Starr gave Stanley Cortez some nice sets to photograph, courtesy of Art Director Jack Otterson, giving the film a nice look despite its meager budget. Vera West, always stylish, makes Nan Grey look great, which is an easy task. Director Otis Garrett gives this Crime Club entry just the right pacing, balancing the romance, humor, and mystery perfectly. The supporting cast, which includes Louise Stanley, Lee J. Cobb, George Meeker, Edward Van Sloan, Richard Skeets' Gallagher, Frank Milan, and Jed Prouty, give a nice accounting of themselves, one and all.

Caeser Kluck (Berton Churchill) is the insufferable sponsor for the station owned by Harry Jones (Jed Pouty). He attempts to meddle in every aspect of the programming, while trying to meddle with innocent receptionist Maria (Louise Stanley). Her pop Tony (Lee J. Cobb) isn't too keen on the old man giving her jewelry, and gangster Joe Carney (Joe Downing) has some business with the rotund and fussy tycoon as well. Radio announcer Dave Chapman (William Lundigan) is one wrong slip away from the axe, as is just about everyone else at the station who are at the mercy of Kluck. He drops dead, of course, and when Benjamin Franklin Butts, named after you know who, realizes he's been poisoned by gas, rather than dying of a heart attack, he hooks up with pretty radio employee Christina 'Steenie' MacCorkle (Nan Grey) to solve the mystery. After leaking it to the press that it was no accident, causing station owner Harry to nearly have his own heart attack, clues begin pointing to Steenie!

There are some nice scenes between Ben and Steenie as a romance blossoms during the investigation, but it never gets in the way of the nifty little plot. When no one wants to risk getting poisoned like Kluck, Harry Lake (Lind Hayes) gets his shot on radio and makes the most of the exhausting night. Someone takes a shot at Steenie as she and Ben get in a cab, and time is running out to find the killer. Balloons which may contain poisonous gas, an exploding safe, a phantom voice on the radio, and a second murder all figure into the solution. As Ben gathers everyone together for the denouement, Steenie tries to decide how her name will sound with Butts on the end. While it's no brain teaser, it is quite fun, and very well executed by a nice cast. Grey is fabulous, with Donald Woods, William Lundigan, and Lind Hayes especially notable. The plot is fun, the cast pleasant, and the script above par, even taking a fun swipe at the grating Katherine Hepburn. Nan Grey looks fabulous, and gets to sing a few bars in this one. What more could you ask for?

Fans of old radio, ""B"" mysteries, Nan Grey, or all of the above won't be disappointed with this one. A must have film for classic film fans and those who collect ""B"" mysteries especially!",1279843200,22,3740,4.695121951219512

8380075,5,B002TCRQRC,A great addition to any fans of the1930's/40's B-movie mysteries.  So how did the extremely unpleasant millionaire get murdered in a radio station during a live broadcast and who did it?  Plenty of questions and suspects with two extremely likable leads played by Donald Woods and Nan Grey.  I thought the story moved along nicely and the transfer to DVD is very watchable.  Have fun!,1487376000,,384,4.861538461538461
8380076,1,B002TCRQRC,"Lacks a story that you can follow along with interest. Very slow. You know someone has committed a murder, but from then on; all the activities of the characters are not moving toward any goal and are not interesting. The guy who does singing impressions is good, but he plays a small part and the main characters put you to sleep. Not clever. No character acting from the main characters. Poor script. All happening within a couple of rooms in the radio studio. The film has a snappy title and intriguing picture on the DVD cover, but that is where it all stops. A far better mystery is ""A Cottage To Let"" with Alastair Sim who played Scrooge in ""A Christmas Carol"".",1478304000,,667,4.475409836065574

8380081,4,B002TCRQRC,"I'll just second  what  Bobby Underwood and the other positive reviewers have to say. This is a first class ""B"" movie which gives us a chance to see a number of future stars like Lee Cobb, earning a buck wherever they could in those dismal Depression days few of us like to remember. Donald Woods, a veteran of this kind of films, was his usual competent self, while Nan Grey did well in the stereotyped love interest role. The film is a good example of the kind of movie that played as the second feature in the 3 1/2 hour show that local movie houses offered in the 1930's and 40's until Cinema-scope and television, among other developments, changed the nature of the movie-going experience.",1459555200,,694,4.544
