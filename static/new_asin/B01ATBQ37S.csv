7609744,5,B01ATBQ37S,"My three-year-old twins love Paw Patrol and anytime we buy a new ""movie,"" they squeal with excitement! We currently own all of the Paw Patrol DVDs that have been released and when I saw that there was a new one coming out soon, I pre-ordered it right away. I love that Paw Patrol is safe for young children because it shows Ryder and the pups helping the citizens of Adventure Bay by keeping the town safe. It's great for both boys and girls since it's a show that my kids won't fight over when we pick out something to watch! As a mom, I am very comfortable letting my kids watch this because it's fun and safe.

Paw Patrol: Sports Day is a compilation of six episodes that feature the pups and some kind of sport whether it's basketball, snowboarding, or soccer. The episode names are:

Pups Save a Basketball Game
Pup-Fu!
Pups Save the Mayor's Race
Pups Save a Snowboard Competition
Pups Save the Soccer Game
Air Pups

The DVD is 92 minutes long and can be watched in English 5.1 Dolby Digital, Spanish Dolby Stereo, and French Dolby Stereo. Pup-Fu! and Air Pups are double-length episodes whereas the others average around the normal 11 to 12 minutes long each. Every episode is about the pups participating in some kind of sport and they are very cute. Mayors Goodway and Humdinger appear in most of the episodes and Everest appears in Pups Save a Snowboard Competition along with her companion, Jake.

My kids were thrilled with this DVD and we've already watched it twice! A lot of times when we purchase a new DVD, we end up watching it a lot right away because of the excitement over having a new ""movie"" to watch and then later on, not as much. We still watch it occasionally and it's nice to have several DVDs from which to choose so we can switch it up. If you have a Paw Patrol fan, particularly one who likes sports, I highly recommend buying this DVD!",1470182400,28,1866,4.447368421052632

However, I do have a question for the other parents out there: at one point I had a glitchy DVD player in my car (by glitchy I mean I could not control the player, it just started on its own) and I found that there is a hidden episode on this DVD.  It's Pups and the Big Freeze.  I cannot figure out how to get to it now that I have a new and fully functioning player!  Any techies out there willing to try to find this Easter Egg?

7609805,5,B01ATBQ37S,"Keeps the kids Quiet for a little while. The dogs are cute and use a ton of teamwork which I like. There are two gripes though. 1) The premise seems to be a bit flawed. For the life of me I can't understand how Alex has so many dogs, lives on his own, and has an unlimited budget. 2) How the Mayor is still in office is beyond me. She basically depends on cute puppies as her defense and fire and rescue. But the kids love it so here is to peace and quiet.",1478131200,11,456,3.8617021276595747

7609824,5,B01ATBQ37S,"Paw Patrol is an adorable preschooler show that features a team of dogs who work together to complete missions. This DVD features six sporty episodes where each episode has a sport activity in it. This is a great DVD to have on hand for when your Paw Patrol fan misses it on television or is just looking for something new to watch. All the episodes have previously aired on television but it is great to have them all on one disc.

PAW Patrol: Sports Day! includes the following episodes:

Pups Save a Basketball Game - Mayor Goodway needs a basketball team, so she calls Ryder and the PAW Patrol for help. The pups become the Adventure Bay All-Stars and they'll need everyone, including a reluctant Marshall, to pitch in and help win one for Adventure Bay.

Pup-Fu! - The PAW Patrol and the mischievous kittens from Mayor Humdinger's Kit-tastrophe Crew are both competing for their martial arts belts when they come across an ancient scroll that holds all the secrets. Mayor Humdinger steals the scroll and the PAW Patrol is called upon to find and return it back to Sensei Yumi.

Pups Save the Mayor's Race - It's the annual Mayor's Race and Mayor Goodway is determined to beat the cheating and devious Mayor Humdinger. Mayoral contestants need to row a boat, swim and run a foot race to the finish line. The pups need to help Mayor Goodway train for the race and clean up Mayor Humdingers' disasters.

Pups Save a Snowboard Competition - Jake and Everest are excited for the big Snowboard Competition, until they look outside and see the course is completely buried under a blanket of snow. The rescue pups help clear the course and rescue the Kit-tastrophe crew kittens who veer off-course and fall off a cliff. Everest uses her grappling hook to lower

Ryder down the edge of the cliff and her snowboard jet pulls them back up to safety.

Pups Save the Soccer Game - When Mayor Humdinger challenges the Adventure Bay team to a soccer match, Ryder and the PAW Patrol are called in to play. The PAW Patrol players start strong but a series of mysterious mishaps jeopardize their team's victory. The pups must work as a team to overcome some dirty tricks by Mayor Humdinger and pull out a win.

Pups Take it to the Sky - The PAW Patrol takes to the sky in their all new Air Patroller airplane! When an active volcano spews out hot lava and scatters a frightened monkey family, it's up to the PAW Patrol to gather them all and bring them back to safety.

7609830,5,B01ATBQ37S,"Another great paw patrol movie! My son was thrilled that the air pups episode was on he loves that they have an air patroller and is fascinated with robo dog.  Although being that the DVD is titled sports day I'm not entirely sure how it is a sports episode, the dogs all get new flight suits. So they all fly now not just Sky and they rescue monkeys, and the man who lives in the lighthouse and his cousin.
The other episodes are:
*pups save a basketball game
*pups save a snowboard competition
*pups save the soccer game
*pups save the mayor's race

The only thing I wish is that they would either put a whole season on DVD or at least group episodes together with the air patroller or where they have some of the newer gear like spy Chase. We don't have cable so the only episodes we catch are at his grandparents and he gets so excited when they have one with the air patroller or spy Chase.",1471392000,2,895,4.228070175438597
