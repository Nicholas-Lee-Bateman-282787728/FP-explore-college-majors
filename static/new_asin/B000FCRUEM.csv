8120836,3,B000FCRUEM,The instruction from Dan is good but the quality of the video was poor. The video was choppy and it would skip ahead missing some of the instruction.,1401494400,,149,4.357142857142857
8120837,5,B000FCRUEM,"Again, I say ""Dan Inosanto is a Living Legend!""  If you happen agree with me, these videos are essential for *your* collection.  His martial arts instruction in these videos are straightforward and are simply priceless.

HOWEVER, please NOTE that I gave a ""reluctant 5 stars"" for the video content and the wonderful instruction *BUT* I feel compelled to mention that the video quality appears to be an old VHS video conversion onto DVD media; not broadcast quality (from BETAMAX, etc) but completely viewable and still essential for martial artists/collectors, etc. ... *you* know who you are!

I personally own *ALL* of the videos in this series (6).

Cheers,

8120840,3,B000FCRUEM,"Hi,

This is a preview DVD for all other DVD 2-6. It gives brief examples from each type of arts - knife, stick, empty hands etc. Good to see the overall picture but not enough for practice in detail.

8120841,5,B000FCRUEM,First of all you can tell the video was made in the 80's and for some reason it would not play on laptop only dvd players. As far as the video goes Dan is excellant in explaining techniques with sticks and open hands i have studied different styles of martial arts and watching this video i have picked up some great techniques that i can incorporate into my studies. I will be ordering more videos by Dan Insoanto in the future.,1347580800,3,429,4.308641975308642
