7031139,5,B00U8RHB84,"We first saw some of the episodes of Moone Boy on our local public television station and found them hilarious.  We went on to watch the entire three season series on-line.  Now that we can own the entire series, I decided to order it.  Some of the references in it are obscure if you are not Irish descent but most of the humor is universal.  I understand an American version is in the works and I'll be interested to see how that works out.",1468972800,5,442,4.226190476190476
7031140,5,B00U8RHB84,"Could it be just me, or do a make a complete eijet of myself laughing at this show?  You may have to be Irish to get some of the inside jokes, but if you have ever had children or been one yourself, you will find this delightful.",1468022400,3,229,3.872340425531915

7031142,5,B00U8RHB84,"This series is simply the best. Fantastic writing, perfectly cast, outstanding performances. Seriously, every actor in this production nails every scene. Dangerously funny and adictive. I can't stop watching it over and over! If you don't love this show, then I am truly sad for you. Because that means there's something deeply wrong with you. I mean, on a neurological level. You should be concerned. Please, go get a CAT scan or an MRI or whatever. Get well soon.",1466121600,9,465,4.89873417721519

7031147,5,B00U8RHB84,"What a GREAT series We watched a few episodes on a local university channel and were hooked from the first episode! The writing of the show is fabulous! It is funny, and witty, and endearing. The actors are all quite talented and fun to watch. We have already watched all three seasons plus all the extras and are now re-watching the episodes again. Show creator/writer, Chris O'Dowd, will be most familiar to US audiences for his part in the movie, ""Bridesmaids"". The great thing about his appearance in Moone Boy is that it is based loosely on HIS life growing up in Boyle, Ireland (""Boyle Soil"") and so his acting is really serving as the Storyteller. O'Dowd's companion on the series is a young Irish boy turned actor named David Rawle. David is funny, endearing, and the perfect person to play Martin Moone. Deirdre O'Kane plays Martin Moone's mother. Deirdre is a renowned Irish actor and comedienne. She was performing a  well-received one-woman stand up comedy show in Ireland while we were there this summer... Martin Moone's father, Liam, is played by Irish Academy Award nominated actor Peter McDonald. Strong cast plus great writing makes this series boxed set a real TREASURE!!!",1444089600,,1191,4.896039603960396

8704725,5,B00U8RHB84,Odd movie about a young boy who has an invisible friend. He's an adult who he talks to. It was a favorite for the British. It was considered a family series. I watched part of it. British humor is dry.,1534032000,,201,4.05
