I giggled uncontrollably throughout the entire video.  LOVED it in it's entirety.  All of the characters were great; (CM ""Punkrock; ""Marble"" Henry).  Just the sight of Taker in tiny PINK tights caused me to laugh out loud for quite some time.  See title for another rib tickler.",1426377600,,421,4.546666666666667

6874392,4,B00QKOKS8O,"The Flintstones are a classic TV cartoon family that I loved as a child. This new DVD brings back Fred, Barney, Wilma, Betty, Bam Bam and Pebbles for more crazy adventures. Fred looses all the money he saved for the family vacation, so he has to come up with a scheme on how to make the money back!  Of course Fred can not do it alone and he drags his willing best friend Barney into the scheme as well.  Poor Barney gets the brunt of it and tossed in with some scary wrestlers.  Will the dynamic duo make enough money to take the ladies on vacation or will they have to suffer the wrath of Wilma and Betty.  Pick up this movie for the Easter basket and see if the guys can save the day!",1426204800,,687,4.066666666666666

6874394,5,B00QKOKS8O,"As someone that grew up with the Flintstones it was great to see new content tied into the WWE! I had no clue what to expect in this movie, but my kids and I had a ton of fun watching this. The story was strong and for me as a past fan, I loved being able to share the Flintstones with my girls alongside WWE characters that they were already aware of. The girls that the humor in the show was great and they were laughing like crazy throughout the movie. So get ready to laugh during a fun movie that will fly by faster than you could even imagine.

6874396,5,B00QKOKS8O,"I loved The Flintstones as a child and I loved that I was able to introduce them to my kids.  My boys loved seeing some familiar WWE stars in an animated movie!  The story stars John Cena as a regular guy who takes up wrestling!  It is a hair-brained plan that Fred comes up with and of course Barney is put front and center.  Fred needs money to take his family on vacation and decides to host a wrestling even, or smackdown actually.  The video is not dangerous or bad-fighting, more silly wrestling going on.  I enjoyed watching this title with my kids on family movie night and while they don't really watch wrestling they enjoyed it.  They know who John Cena is though and thought it was hysterical to see him as John Cenastone.  I knew who the wrestlers were so it was something I could relate to and my kids.  It's very cute and runs about an hour long.",1425859200,,860,4.291925465838509

Fred, of course, has another scheme to make money.  This time it is for a good cause though -- taking Betty on a real vacation.  The whole thing starts  when Fred looses his salary needed to take the family on a vacation.  While at a charity match, Barney's kickasorous against all comers.  The crowd loves it!  Fred cooks up an event to get back enough money for the vacation -- a match with Barney against John Cornerstone, Marble Henry and The Undertaker.  This DVD is good for any Flintstone fan!

Many feel that Adam Smith is the father of Capitalism and he focused on the role of enlightened self-interest (the ""invisible hand"") and the role of specialization in promoting the efficiency of capital accumulation. This movie, however, would lead you to believe that maybe these theories predate him. When thinkers like Fred Flinstone practiced and, Mr. McMagma improved upon, those same ideas thousands of years before Adam Smith. Still a quality flick.

6874451,4,B00QKOKS8O,"This is the second animated movie under both WB animation & WWE Studios this time teaming WWE with cartoon icons ""The Flintstones"" for their first new animated feature in 14 years featuring various WWE personalities including John Cena (John Cenastone), C.M. Punk (C.M. Punkrock), Mark Henry (Marble Henry), Rey Mysterio (Rey Mysteriopal), Daniel Bryan (Daniel Bryrock), Nikki & Bree Bella (The Boulder Twins), Mr. McMahon (Mr. McMagma), and The Undertaker (as himself).

Fred wants to take his family & The Rubbles on a vacation so asked his boss Mr. Slate for an advance but unfortunately caused an accident where they both had to be saved by the newest employee John Cenastone resulting in Slate denying the advance.  Fred gets an idea later on at a charity function after Barney saved his pet from being bullied by C.M. Punkrock & Marble Henry to run a sports entertainment event recruiting Cenastone & others (Rey Mysteriopal & The Undertaker) to raise the funds for the vacation successfully only for him to get very greedy to spend the money to put together another & bigger event with his selfish attitude causing everyone to walk out on him leaving Fred alone to deal with not only putting on the show by himself but also dealing with Punkrock, Henry, and their associates The Boulder Twins with one man watching in the audience who likes the concept so much that he'll make it the biggest in the world...even if it takes 65 million years.

DVD extras include two behind the scenes look at the movie along with two bonus Flintstones episodes ""The Engagement Ring"" (Barney goes rounds with a boxing champion to earn money for Betty's gift) & ""Take Me Out To The Ball Game"" (Barney becomes a little league baseball coach while Fred becomes the umpire).  Not to nitpik but to go with the wrestling theme of this movie, ""Ventriloquist Barney"" would have been a better selection for a bonus episode since that one is based around a wrestling match.

I'm not going to sit here & over analyze this movie by comparing it to the classic original Flintstones series from over 50 years ago as far as the animation being different or character voices not being an exact match or character names not being creative enough because this movie is targeted towards family & children and they really aren't going to care about that stuff when watching it together.  With that being said, the only real negatives I can say is that the movie is only around 50 mins. while Daniel Bryan's role is reduced to a cameo to have a ""Daffy & Bugs"" moment with Cena when I expected more from him based off how he's heavily advertised for this movie.  The positives is that the WWE superstars are captured perfectly in the Bedrock environment as far as their personalities go while still being able to have some fun with some characters such as them putting The Undertaker in situations & outfits that everyone knows we would never see his character do in his real life, Punkrock & Marble Henry had some funny chemistry together & the antics of the Flintstones characters weren't a stretch from what you would expect.

In the end, this was enjoyable overall as I watched it with my young son & he wanted to watch it again shortly after so I recommend.",1427068800,5,3229,4.7229129662522205

6874458,1,B00QKOKS8O,"Even grading on the curve that is kids' cartoons, this movie is terrible. Everyone involved should be embarrassed and ashamed of themselves.

#1 The new voice actors are terrible. Only Fred sounds remotely close to the traditional voices. Barney is particularly awful. (As extras they do include 2 classic episodes to show you how bad this film is in comparison.

#2 Remember all the old jokes about how cheap Hanna-Barbara animation looked? You know, the constantly repeated bit about how when someone runs, the same 3 backgrounds are recycled over and over again? Somehow, this movie is even cheaper looking than the 60's original shows. Backgrounds don't change for LONG periods of time and there is NO attention to detail in the character drawings. The artwork for this movie is such a step down from the TV show which seems like it would be nearly impossible to do in 2015.

#3 If you are looking for those clever Flintstone puns and word play that you grew up on....they aren't here in any way. The closest thing to clever names here is ""CM Punk-Rock"". The only remotely witty joke is at the end where Vince McMahon takes over Fred's promotion which with how tone deaf the writers of this thing were, is probably unintentional. This movie had to have had ""creative input"" from one of those terrible WWE writing team guys because there is no way that the HB people could be so clueless on what makes the Flintstones work.",1426377600,3,1426,4.718875502008032

The animation is okay, and the voice acting is good.  It was neat to see the Undertaker talking to Fred Flintstone and John Cena doing the ""Duck Season, Rabbit Season!"" joke, that got a chuckle out of me.
