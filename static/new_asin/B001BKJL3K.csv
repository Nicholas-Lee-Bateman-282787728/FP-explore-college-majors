8283353,1,B001BKJL3K,Monte is a world class player. I wanted to give this concert as a Christmas gift. Imagine my disappointment when I received a Cd instead of the Dvd.,1513814400,,148,4.321428571428571
8283354,1,B001BKJL3K,Be careful.  I received an item other than the Monte Montgomery DVD,1464652800,,67,4.583333333333333
8283355,5,B001BKJL3K,"Monte is my new acoustic guitar hero. I seen him on Live at Daryl's House and was totally blown away with his version of Sarah Smile. The two other musicians on this DVD are awesome too. If you never seen or heard of Monte Montgomery and his group, you don't know what your missing. Monte's style is straight from his soul. His chops are up there with Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Eddie Van Halen, Tommy Emanuel, and many other great guitarist before him. Another thing I like about his music is, he's not locked in with one particular style. I hope he comes to my neck of the woods sometime, hint, hint, Ann Arbor, MI. I'll be first in line to purchase my tickets.",1441411200,,669,4.36

8283358,5,B001BKJL3K,A friend of mine brought this DVD to my house and we watched it. I had never heard of Monte Montgomery before that night but I was completely blown away by his talent and orginality. There is nothing bad to say about this DVD except it isn't a BluRay. LOL If you are a fan of talented guitar players this is a must.,1345593600,,315,4.015873015873016
8283359,5,B001BKJL3K,"Monte Montgomery performs his amazing guitar feats up close and unabridged in this, his first and only DVD recorded live at Birmingham's Work PLay Theater.  I recommend this DVD to every Monte Montgomery fan and more so to anyone that has never been to one of his ""blow-awayable"" live shows.  Monte is an ""American Original"" with not only the very best guitar chops but also equally amazing vocals and inspiring original lyrics.",1319932800,,428,4.930555555555555
8283360,5,B001BKJL3K,This DVD was recommended to me from a friend and I was very impressed with Monte Montgomery's guitar playing.  He is as good and / or better that Bonamassa on the acoustic. I highly recommend the DVD. Really great stuff!,1292889600,,220,4.5
