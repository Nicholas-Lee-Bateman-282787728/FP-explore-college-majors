8695780,1,B00RQURPK0,"I've been a licensed clinical social worker for 15+ years.  I purchased the DVD and workbook to use in groups with my Veterans.  This video is poorly made, nothing of any real comedic value, which is as advertised.  The Vets I showed it too had very negative reactions to it.  On a personal level, there were periods where I was uncomfortable watching because I was embarrassed at just how bad it was.  I contacted the company, they were down right rude...I have the emails saved in case any are wondering. I asked for a refund and they flat out said ""NO"". This is a bad group of money grubbing individuals who know nothing of recovery...avoid this or any other product from them.  I spent over $100 and it was a complete waste, as either a professional, or a consumer.",1512950400,,769,4.496402877697841
