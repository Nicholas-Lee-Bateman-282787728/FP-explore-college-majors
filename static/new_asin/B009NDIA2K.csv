5353430,1,B009NDIA2K,"The acting is horrible and none of the characters are believable! I laughed my way through all episodes, fast forwarding over the boring bits. I am glad I watched it as part of my Acorn subscription and not after buying the DVD.",1435795200,,228,4.4523809523809526
5353431,2,B009NDIA2K,"Oh my, what a terrible series. Charles Dance and Eileen Atkins, really? What were they thinking, two fine actors accepting roles in this slop. As other reviewers have pointed out, the scenery is lovely, but the acting is flat (emotions run the gamut from A to B) and it's just silly. I watched it on Acorn TV (streaming), but I would NEVER waste money on the DVD.",1434844800,4,363,4.432835820895522
5353432,1,B009NDIA2K,Must agree wholeheartedly with other poor reviews.  I am so sorry that Dance and Atkins were part of this as they are otherwise superb.  Scenery was lovely but even these two fine actors couldn't save this story and the acting of fellow players.  I'm not sure how the director kept on filming each scene . . . it must have been agony.,1434412800,4,334,4.354838709677419
5353433,1,B009NDIA2K,"One star for Charles Dance who could make the phone book sound interesting.  Minus 4 stars for everything else.  I saw this amazingly poor series as part of my membership with Acorn TV.  Holy smoke what a mess.  Not sure why it was necessary to dub Eleanore Weisgerber's voice, but it is very distracting.  Did they think viewers wouldn't notice?  And aside from Charles Dance, I would recommend the other lead actors all take the summer off for a refresher course.  ""Conrad"" chews the scenery to the point of being humorous. And the eternal ingenue daughter is down right annoying after the first 3 minutes. Gag, gag, gag.  Do yourself a favor.....  Spend $5 to join Acorn and watch it there.  You can then console yourself with Foyle's War and Poirot.",1434326400,17,753,4.679389312977099
5353434,1,B009NDIA2K,"The scenery is absolutely gorgeous.
Charles Dance and his mother aside, the acting is awful.
I presume it was dubbed post-filming? That's the only reason I can find for the totally lack-lustre dialogue.
I lost track of all the smooth-haired blondes, and who was sleeping with whom.
The book might be good (although I was left wondering if none of the men could keep it in their trousers or at least put on a condom) but the film version is pretty poor.",1431561600,22,452,4.524390243902439

5353436,4,B009NDIA2K,"Highly enjoyable piece of nonsense - once we started watching it last night, we stayed up till 3am and saw the whole thing (some 6 hours.)
It's the tale of an aristocratic family in Scotland: Charles Dance is the paterfamilias, living with his American wife in a wonderful house by a loch. Then there's his two lovely daughters, and a son being groomed to take over the family business. But nothing goes smoothly, and from the opening sequence when our charmed family are having their photograph taken, there's a lot in store... Disputed paternity, births, deaths, love, cheating, and a dastardly (but rather good-looking) son-in-law.
It's all played out in highly photogenic surroundings, in a Scotland where it's forever high summer. The conversation is stilted and totally unrealistic at times, but if you watch it for a good night's entertainment you won't be disappointed",1387929600,28,876,5.090277777777778

5353438,2,B009NDIA2K,"This adaptation of Rosamund Pilcher's writing will strike most native English speakers as odd, stilted at times, uneven and quirky. A great deal of acting talent went underutilized, uncoached and/or unprodded. Glaringly wooden dialogue, and at times glaringly wooden performances, clash with a score that tries too hard to convey the emotion that is lacking in the performances. This clash is comic at times, unintentionally so. Another reason for the stilted quality of the dialogue is the fact that roughly half the cast hail from countries on the continent, and several had their voices dubbed, clumsily. You will strain your ears through several episodes before hearing the lilt of a genuine Scottish accent, too rare a thing considering this is a tale of two adjacent estates and the loose-loined Lairds and Ladies who kept populating them...
The scenery will provide occasional relief, but the rather low-key sound and fury signifies nothing...this is disjointed fluff.",1470182400,,975,5.337662337662338
5353439,2,B009NDIA2K,Nothing remotely like Rosamund Pilcher who could paint a scene so you could taste the tea.,1469577600,2,90,4.6875
5353440,5,B009NDIA2K,It a typical Rosamunde Pilcher story and everything turns out allright in the end. Its pleasant.,1464825600,,96,5.0625
5353441,2,B009NDIA2K,The way this was described and what you actually get are just the opposite.  The story line is almost a comedy and I can't tell if the voices are dubbed or it is a really bad job of making this adaptable for US viewing.  It is pity that Charles Dance had to be associated with this piece.,1460332800,2,288,4.035087719298246

5353446,1,B009NDIA2K,"At first, Shades of Love, appears to be a modern Downton Abbey.  After a while, it is clear that the story is written like a daytime soap opera, but only worse with characters that do not act rationally or consistently.  Yes, the scenery is beautiful and that is the only virtue to be found.  What is really strange though, is that the characters move back and forth from Scotland to London in some magical fashion without really traveling.  Apparently they click their shoes together and move from place to place just like Dorothy.",1453593600,7,532,4.688172043010753
5353447,2,B009NDIA2K,"This is a half-baked chic flick at best. It is set in Scotland where apparently everyone lives in 50 room mansions. The story follows 2 interconnected families that both must have millions of dollars a year to spend on the upkeep of their Downton Abbey sized mansions. Neither monogamy nor birth control seem popular, so there are surprises in store with the parentage of a couple of women. The actors involved speak with the oddest variety of accents. Some sound English, some sound like English is a second or third language, and none sound the least bit Scottish at all. The women are pretty and the scenery is pretty and your wife will be happy if you sit through it.",1446854400,4,671,4.6

5353450,4,B009NDIA2K,I keep trying to see the current actors as the ones from the movie September. The screen writer did a good job of following the story and there were only small areas that could have been better.,1443830400,,194,4.27027027027027
5353451,1,B009NDIA2K,"My understanding on the ""Stars"" rating system is that you have to give something at least ONE star, correct? So, that is why I am wildly overrating this piece of fluff, truly the cinematic equivalent of cotton candy.
Where does one start with this bloated potboiler? I've never read any Rosamunde Pilcher, and if this teleplay is indicative of the quality of her material, that will not soon change. This five-part series, which seems to drag on forever, is a sort of Dynasty-cum-Dallas-cum-Monarch of the Glen, but without any humour, irony, wit, or campiness. You wonder why it was made in the first place! And why the presence of such distinguished British actors as Charles Dance, Harriet Walter and Eileen Atkins?? Contractual obligations? Huge remunerations? Slow time in their busy schedules? Truly mystifying. Pretty much the rest of the cast is German or Austrian, and often the German accents come through when they shouldn't. German star Eleonora Weisgerber, who plays the ""American"" spouse of Charles Dance' business magnate, has all of her dialogue dubbed; evidently she could not pull off a convincing American accent. The result is stunningly awkward, grating, annoying and stultifying.
I was drawn to the series because it was set in Scotland. However, I'm guessing that the ""Scotland"" claim could be made as a result of merely sprinkling in a few aerial shots of highland landscapes and stately homes.
Why does not one of the characters speak with a Scots accent? Maybe all the landed gentry in Scotland are from the south, down London way? But we are constantly told that the Balnaird home has been in the family for 'centuries'. Perhaps it's too tough to do the Scots thing (Harriet Walter notwithstanding; she did a very convincing Lady MacBeth in an audio version of the play.). And if you are a native German speaker, maybe doing a Scots brogue is asking way too much.
And speaking of the houses....the two principal estates are your typical enormous piles of grandeur, with 50+ bedrooms, grand staircases, libraries holding thousands of volumes, hundreds of acres of manicured lawns and gardens, fountains, and so on. A vast fleet of laborers would be required to maintain these places, yet the families seem to pull it off all by themselves. In fact they seem to spend most of their time fly-fishing or dining.
The plot, dialogue and characterizations are abysmally simplistic and laughably predictable. The cast gives it their all, but with this turgid material, what can you do? Rebecca Night is an attractive young actress but will not likely be nominated for any acting awards any time soon. She--and many of the characters--seem to be hopping into bed with one another at the drop of a hat, and it's obvious that most of them do not bother with any means of birth control.
My wife and I got through the whole thing over a couple of nights, but we were chuckling a good part of the time. But keep in mind: there is no 'intentional' comedy in this series! If you like crappy, lighter-than-air, sudsy romantic fluff, you might enjoy this. Rosamunde Pilcher is, no doubt, laughing all the way to the bank.",1440374400,3,3130,4.885338345864661
5353452,5,B009NDIA2K,"Dame Eileen Atkins, always a treat, and Charles Dance (Game of Thrones) are the headliners in this Downton Abbey-Meets-Dallas-Meets-Dynasty series, set against the lush backdrop of the Scottish Highlands. The way-too-wealthy Aird family may have it all, but somehow it all begins to suddenly unravel and they're incapable of stopping the avalanche. Plenty of secrets are stashed away, inside and around, the magnificent Bainard House (If you can't have Downton's famed  Highclere Castle, this will do quite nicely!) and now these old scores are surfacing in a way that's reminiscent of the tensions that drove those characters on Dynasty. No spoilers here, because you want to be in on the spiraling action that could be a threat to the very existence of this moneyed clan. Wheeling, dealing, passion, scandal--the prize ingredients for any family drama! Will the Airds rally somehow and salvage the ancestral mansion or will they wind up living very much 'below stairs'?",1439769600,3,971,5.264516129032258
5353453,5,B009NDIA2K,"My wife and I both felt Shades of Love underrated, and declared the series 4.5 & up for Scot romantic mystery drama. The scenes are delectable stunning vistas with fantastic music background. We honestly found the story and personal relationships captivating, not unlike what is found in Rosamunde Pilcher novels. HOWEVER, this is NOT her novel September. In that novel, and mentioned in the dialogue for Shades of Love, Pandora Balmerino (Archies sis) kills herself. Thus, this story proves to be a generation after that book. It is a new Pilcher character story, adapting not a novel, but characters from September and Shell Seekers.
Oh the lives that turn to sleaze; if at first we do deceive. It is almost a Scottish Dallas, of sorts.
As Granny (Eileen Atkins Upstairs, Downstairs Doc Martin) states: Some things are best kept secret.

The Balnaird House is headed by Edmund Aird (Charles Dance Bleak House Gosford Park & more beside Thrones) son of Granny, wed to Virginia; all September novel characters that continue this family saga. Married to an Aird daughter is Noel (Adrian Lukis Pride & Prejudice) a character of which appears in the 2 Pilcher novels listed above. Archie Balmerino is 3rd Lord of Croy House mentioned in the September book. His wife is Isobel (Harriet Walter Sense & Sensibility). The Croy House is the location of the original novels September Ball, an event that is rekindled in this series, and with the most enchanting Scottish band music and dance. I could replay that scene dozens of times. Like Pilcher novels, its all about love and secrets, and adultery, and back-stabbing, and  Its good to go into this DVD series knowing some background for more enjoyment.

Pilcher fans will find this closer to a 5-star than not.
SDH SUBTITLES for all 4 feature-length episodes
1 Family Secret ==Is Laura Aird (Rebecca Night) the daughter of Conrad Tucker (Michael Brandon) and his one night affair with Lady Virginia? He heads for Scotland in search of truth. There is old and new secrets. A tragic end to the episode.
2 A Healing Heart ==Laura hides from social contact but gets help from neighbor Hamish Balmerino (Johannes Zirner). Noel & Alexa (Susanna Simon) drift further apart as Balmerinos September Ball looms. Secrets explode into the open at the ball. A meeting begins to mend one gap.
3 The Scandal ==Granny dies leaving a questionable estate share to Olivia Thorpe, a vet, and a surprise resultant of Pandora. Alexa & Noel are officially divorced. Lauras hired in a publishing firm in London, following a 2-month American biological father/family visit.
4 Reconciliation ==The families reunite for a special occasion. Balnaird, Aird estate, is at risk. Revelations and scheming reach a fevered peak as families ache for happiness. Decisions are forced into the making.

When considered as a film sequel to Pilchers September novel, Rosamunde fans will agree this is a worthy addition to that group of stories. It is scandalous romance, but then, perhaps that is how the real posh elite live and love.
