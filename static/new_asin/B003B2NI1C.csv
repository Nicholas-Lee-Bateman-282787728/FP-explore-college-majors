8393330,5,B003B2NI1C,"Miracle in Milan is only available through Arrow Films in an all regions format (as far as I know). It plays fine on a region 1 player (USA), and looks pretty good, especially after finding it on Amazon UK for a very reasonable price (go see for yourself). Shipping took less than a week and arrived undamaged. This is obviously not a true review of the film. If you are already familiar with it and as fond of it as I am, then need I say more?",1281225600,,444,4.114942528735632
