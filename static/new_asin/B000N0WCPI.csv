8173835,5,B000N0WCPI,Classic Ken Wilson safari film.  It is fine for the price.,1502668800,,58,4.2727272727272725
8173836,3,B000N0WCPI,"Overall, its OK, a majority of the filming is done with no tripod so the view is very shaky and almost made me sick especially the first 15 minutes or so.  The good news is when they are actually ""taking the shot"" it appears the camera is on a tripod or at least something steady so those portions are ok. The content is pretty good, depicting locals in their real environment and you'll see quite a few ""oops"" throughout the movie that I found entertaining.",1477094400,,458,4.3882352941176475
