As I wrote in my Family Home Theater review of the complete series, this coming-of-age TV comedy-drama gets it right. Lots of things can shape a person, and just as WWII defined a generation, so did the 60swhich historians date from John F. Kennedys 1963 assassination to Richard M. Nixons 1972 resignation. The Wonder Years managed to capture the perfect storm of events that were always in a familys consciousnesseven as the father tried to put food on the table, siblings fought and sought to find their place in the world, and the mother tried to hold them all together. And Season 4 is the absolute best of the six seasons.

Like Leave It to Beaver, the series episodes were seen from the point of view of an adolescent, and you knew you were in for an interesting ride when this 1987 series shunned a laugh track and introduced the kind of voiceover narrator that we got in A Christmas Storyan adult version of the main character. And you knew that the series would meet the 60s head-on when the pilot called for the girl-next-doors older brother to be killed in Vietnam, and for our hero to comfort her in a scene that would culminate in a first kiss for each of themboth as characters, and as actors.

Fred Savage was perfectly cast as Kevin, who at 13 became the youngest actor ever nominated for a Primetime Outstanding Lead Actor for a Comedy Series Emmy. His doe eyes reflected innocence, while his impish smile was a sign that he could say or do something impulsive or mischievous at any moment. The girl next door, Winnie Cooper, was also well cast with Danica McKellar perfect as someone who would be both a best friend and love interest over the course of the shows six seasons. And for comic relief and guy-to-guy matters there was bespectacled Paul (Josh Saviano), a brainy pal who was also Kevins best friend. The tone was wink-wink as this group navigated the halls of junior high, then high school and all of the problems that seem so major to this age group: crushes, dates, tormentors, cliques, and run-ins with teachers and coaches.

On the home front, older brother Wayne (Jason Hervey) was obviously fond of his brother but lived to torment him, while much older sister Karen (Olivia dAbo) was so caught up in the 60s that she was a flower child from the very first episode. The parents were extremely well cast, with Dan Lauria returning from work each day grumpy and feeling chewed up and spat out, and Alley Mills deferring to him while also trying to act as mediator when he got on the kids.

Then theres the music. I don't know how they got the permissions, but Season 4 includes songs by Joan Baez, The Beach Boys, The Byrds, Nat King Cole, Judy Collins, Lee Dorsey, Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, Jimi Hendrix, The Monkees, Randy Newman, Smokey Robinson & the Miracles, Sam & Dave, Bob Seger, Edwin Star, The Ventures, The Who, and Hank Wilson.

Season 4 has the highest number of fan-rated classic episodes. This season the family goes to Jacks company picnicno one more reluctantly than Kevin, whos afraid of seeing a girl who used to have a crush on him. This season his first girlfriend Winnie moves and changes schools, then finds a new boyfriend and breaks up with Kevin. No matter, because Kevin has also found someone else and is juggling two relationships. Never a show to shy away from reality, The Wonder Years: Season 4 also features an episode in which Kevin and his friends try to crash a 10th-grade girls pajama party thinking beer will be their magic pass. This season Kevin runs for student council against his nemesis, Becky Slater, and also discovers his coach moonlighting as a mall Santa. Kevin and Wayne argue over whos going to take over Karens room when she goes off to college, Kevin and his father have another disastrous time of it when they go off to buy a suit for Kevin, and the up-and-down Winnie and Kevin saga culminates in an I love you moment and sets up the groups graduation from junior high.

Though The Wonder Years may shock young girls who probably don't want to believe that this is the way young boys think about girls, it remains one of TVs most honest family coming-of-age comedies. And Season 4 catches the show at its apex. All 23 episodes are included on four single-sided DVDs and housed in a standard-size keep case with plastic pages holding the discs.

Language: Lots of junior-high insults (butthead, scrote, dork) and hells and damns
Sex:  Lots of kissing; masturbation is referenced, as are nudie magazines and talk of orgies
Adult situations: Theres both smoking and drinking in the series, and some pretty intense family fights
Takeaway: When a show is this honest, its no wonder that it still informs and entertains, as it gets to the heart of male adolescence, families, and interpersonal relationships",1455408000,2,5047,4.713961407491487
7507721,4,B017KIRUC0,"Time Life released the 4 Disc set of season four of The Wonder Years on January 16th.  During Season four we not only watch Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage) finish Junior High school, but also begin to transition from a little boy into a young man.

Savage continues to give excellent performances, but it is clear that he, his character, and the rest of the cast are growing up.  Its most noticeable in Kevins best friend Paul (Josh Saviano) whose character begins to step out of Kevins shadow and the actor clearly becomes the first to sprout.

As the characters struggle with the transitions that life is putting them through; the writers struggle as well in season four.  Filled with both good and bad episodes, the writers seem to be embracing the transitions of the characters with the coming of age storylines in Episode three The Journey, and episode four The Cost of Living.  Sadly the growth we see in our characters leaves episode ten The Candidate and episode fifteen Buster standing out as steps in the wrong direction as the stories seem too childish at this juncture.

Luckily the writers finish strong with two of the best episodes of the season.  The Accident shows Winnie Danica McKellar struggling with changes in her life and the episode ends with arguably one of the best moments in the show thus far.  Graduation manages to include an amazing amount of quality storytelling in just twenty two minutes.  Sadly these two episodes sandwich The House That Jack Built in which Karen (Olivia dAbo) begins cohabitating with Michael (Pre Friends David Schwimmer).  This is the only episode of the season where the story focuses on Karen, and the writers portray the character poorly and create a frustrating scenario to watch.

The final episode of the season The Wonder Years: Looking Back, is a pleasant retrospective, but when combined with the bonus material which includes the featurette: ABC: Teachers That Made a Difference, and interviews with Fred Savage, and three of the teachers highlighted in the featurette; it all get a bit redundant.

The visual quality on this release is excellent, and though the sound required an increase in the volume on two different players, the music adds so much to the experience, that it makes the acquisition of the rights, and the subsequent delay in getting the Wonder Years out on DVD, well worth waiting for.

Recommendation: Its hard to say anything negative about such an iconic series that consistently displays quality in all aspects of the production.  Yes; out of the twenty two episodes (not counting the retrospective) in season four; there are some that don't quite hold up as well as others, but, even a weak episode of the Wonder Years still brings back enough pleasant memories to make it worth watching, and since it is on DVD, all you have to do is invest another twenty minutes or so to find one of your favorites.

The Wonder Years is pretty much a must own series and one of the best to introduce to those who never saw it.  Theyll thank you and not only like you, they will like you like you.",1454544000,2,3067,4.756603773584906
7507722,5,B017KIRUC0,"The Wonder Years Season 4 has some great episodes. Like Paul's sister wanting Kevin to take her to the junior prom. Kevin and Wayne fighting over their sister's bedroom to little Buster needing to have to have the chop.

This series was a gem back in the 80's/early 90's and will always remain a gem to this day.

Really glad to be owning this series. Can't wait for the release of Season 5 and Season 6 individually.",1454284800,,417,4.402597402597403

7507724,5,B017KIRUC0,"The Wonder Years: The Complete Fourth Season captures the trials and tribulations of growing up in suburban middle-class America in the late 1960s, as seen through the eyes of Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage).

In Season 4, Kevin is entering his last year at Kennedy Junior High. Things aren't going as smoothly as he had hoped. Though he and Winnie (Danica McKellar) are in love and starting ninth grade, they're at different schools. The Arnolds family life is changing, too, with mother Norma (Alley Mills) taking a new job at Kevins school, father Jack (Dan Lauria) getting a promotion, elder brother Wayne (Jason Hervey) buying a car, and Karen (Olivia dAbo) starting college. Kevin gets his first job as a caddy, is guilted into escorting Pauls little sister to Cotillion, and tries to crash a tenth graders slumber party (with beer). He also finds Coach Cutlip (Robert Picardo) moonlighting as the mall Santa after subjecting the gym class to Death Ball and the Presidents All-American Physical Fitness Challenge. Kevins best friend Paul (Josh Saviano) announces that hell be going to prep school in the fall.

7507725,5,B017KIRUC0,". The GOOD NEWS is that the picture quality this season has really improved over the earlier releases - bright vibrant colors and clear vivid crisp images. Most of the episodes are complete, around the 23 minute mark, you can check it on your DVD, if you see a shorter time, it means that there was probably a song cut out. There are some really touching moments in some of these episodes, with Kevin and Winnie, Kevin and Paul, Jack and Kevin and Jack and Karen. And newcomer Madeline is a real treat to watch.
Included with this set (as in previous releases) is a 20 page leaflet with episode highlights and such features as spotlight on Soleil Moon Frye and  Robert Picardo, , Fun Facts, Wisdom Of Wonder Years and photos
