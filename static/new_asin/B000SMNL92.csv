2888065,5,B000SMNL92,"After five long years of fans begging and pleading, the way too-short TV series Birds of Prey is getting a complete DVD release! The news is truly worth shouting about.

Loosely based on DC Comics and a variety of other sources with a touch of Marvel's the X-Men thrown in, the series continues the legend of The Batman.

We enter the future, dark and fantastic world of New Gotham City. Long after The Batman has driven himself into exile, his legacy lives on in the form of the Birds of Prey - Black Canary, Oracle, and the Huntress.

From the creators of the CW hit Smallville, Birds of the Prey was produced in 2002 for the now defunct WB, but had only 13 episodes before cancellation. Since then, its devoted fan base worked tirelessly to have the series released on DVD. It was a really exciting action show, breaking new ground because ALL of the lead characters were women.

This boxed set collects all 13 episodes and a never-collected-on-DVD before Flash-animated series ""Gotham Girls.""

Awesomely, it also includes the unaired pilot, which featured Sherilyn Fenn (Twin Peaks) in the role of Dr. Quinzel. Mia Sara was later cast as Quinzel in the series. She also appeared in the AIRED pilot. Interestingly, all of the scenes featuring the character in the AIRED pilot were reshot with Sara, word-for-word.

Also of note, the aspect ratio of the episodes in the set will be full frame, but will have dark bars on top and on bottom to mimic widescreen.

While normal citizens slept, the Birds of Prey flocked together to fight crime on the streets of New Gotham City. Several years after the city was abandoned by Batman, the awesome threesome of Huntress (Ashley Scott), Oracle (Dina Meyer), and Black Canary (Rachel Skarsten) was formed. Huntress is the daughter of Batman and Catwoman, and can smell danger from miles away. Black Canary has the gift of clairvoyance and Oracle leads the team through her cyber experience, despite being wheelchair bound by Batman's nemesis, the evil Joker.

When the series opens, we learn that New Gotham's Batman has disappeared leaving behind a daughter from his long-time love Catwoman. Her name is Helena Kyle, who transforms herself into the mysterious superhero known as ""The Huntress."" Helena has hypersensitive senses and agility, but uses her gifts selfishly. Fate brings her face-to-face with her choices as well as a wheel-chair-bound Barbara Gordon, the hero Oracle, who befriends her but agrees to train her only if she uses her powers for good.

She teams up with Barbara, who had been ""Batgirl"" prior to being paralyzed by the Joker. By day, Barbara is a teacher at New Gotham High, but by night she fights crime from her secret lair in the New Gotham Clock Tower.

The two meet a determined Dinah Redmond, a young woman who was drawn to New Gotham to learn more about her powers. Dinah is a touch-telepath and psychic who had terrifying dreams about Batgirl's brutal incident that resulted in her paralysis. The Huntress resists working with Dinah, but Oracle convinces her to give the younger woman a chance. Now, they must learn not only how to work together as New Gotham's protectors, but also as a family.

Special recognition goes to Mark ""Star Wars"" Hamill who briefly reprises his award-winning voice role as the Joker from the iconic classic, Batman: the Animated Series. In Birds of Prey, ""Mister J"" on-camera is portrayed by actor/stuntman Roger Stoneburner but Hamill's voice was dubbed over Stoneburner's performance.

During the course of the series, the women are often confronted with schemes masterminded by the Joker's on-and-off girlfriend, psychiatrist Dr. Harleen ""Harley Quinn"" Quinzel (Mia Sara), but they always prevail and eventually beat her at her own game.

Other characters of note are: Alfred Pennyworth (Ian Abercrombie), who serves Helena as heir to the Wayne estate, and Police Detective Jesse Resse (Shemar Moore), confronted with crimes and abilities he cannot explain.

A central feature of the series is the concept of metahumans: Individuals born with powers that cannot be explained. No two metahumans have the same specific ability (or set of abilities) and there exists a whole sub culture of metahuman society that the outside world knows nothing about.

It is this world that Detective Reese is drawn into, reluctantly teaming up with Huntress and the Birds of Prey to defeat metahuman criminals. At first, he is disapproving of Helena's vigilantism, even trying to arrest her, but eventually he realizes there is a need for the Birds of Prey to take down criminals the police can't handle.

Episodes in this four-disc collection are: the Pilot; Slick; Prey for the Hunter; Three Birds and a Baby; Sins of the Mother; Primal Scream; Split; Lady Shiva; Nature of the Beast; Gladiatrix; Reunion; Feat of Clay; and Devil's Eyes.

Very popular theme song ""Revolution"" was performed by Aimee Allen.",1207267200,237,4898,4.975520195838433

2888067,5,B000SMNL92,"Used to love this show.  Just as it's building up steam and collecting a following, the WB cancels a show that was fun and exciting.  The women in this series were great to Watch, loved the action and the fight scenes.  Would love to see a movie made with these characters on the big screen!",1195689600,13,291,4.254545454545455
2888068,5,B000SMNL92,"Birds of Prey was a series I made sure to watch when it was on tv. But when I always find a TV series I love, it is CANCELLED!!! Please release it on DVD. It is so much better than Smallville which has six seasons available on DVD. But then again I have always preferred Batman to Superman. Darker is way better than goodie goodie (and far sexier!!!).",1187740800,15,351,4.176470588235294
2888069,4,B000SMNL92,"By the time they finished airing the new episodes I was sad to see it go. This was a show that would eventually build on the character driven stories to show some fine performances by the leads. The interplay between the characters was well balanced and entertaining. The addition of Mia Sara as Harley toward the end of the series was fantastic. Great villians make for great heros. Nice casting.

I waited a while to see a decent program with Dina Meyer as a lead. This was that show for me. Ashley and Rachel both seemed to dive into their parts with some flair. With Alfred and the detective rounding out the regulars.

My one criticism was that (especially on my recorded tapes) the sound volume seemed to be very low at times. Not so, with other shows I had recorded. I had to rewind and turn the volume up to catch a joke spoken ""under the breath"" more than once. Worth the effort, but not something I would expect the casual viewer to go through.

The start was a bit slow, but the series did grow on me. I hope to view the performances again, maybe in a better format. Give those ladies (and gentlemen) their wings once again.",1183852800,49,1135,4.395238095238096

2888075,1,B000SMNL92,"I bought this series based on reviews here that said things like. Well acted. Tightly written. Fascinating characters. What others found fascinating I guess I found totally cliched. I thought the acting was passable but not great. Not even really good, but I could forgive the acting because of the material they had to work with. Never have I heard so many stupid lines from other shows repeated as if they were original. You could almost feel the actresses cringe as they delivered some of the most stupid dialogue ever recorded. I put the first DVD in to watch episode one but it was so bad I couldn't finish. A couple weeks later I decided I would give it another chance. Gritting my teeth all the way, I made it through episode one. I couldn't make it through episode two. I can see why this was such a short lived series. What was produced was a pretty good idea with a lot of potential that was victimized by awful writing.",1494201600,,930,4.476470588235294

2888084,5,B000SMNL92,"I liked this series and was able to order it disc by disc off Netflix a while back, but when I saw this set, I decided to buy it and be able to watch any ep whenever I wanted.  Initially the item was delivered on time, but was incomplete.  Allow me to clarify.  The packaging was fine (small crack on lower back area is acceptable), but the case contained no discs, or even the ""pages"" they'd be mounted on...just an empty case w/ outside art and printed insert.  This would be a bargain and I have arranged for a replacement item through Amazon.  Other buyers may want to shake the package and if it doesn't rattle, you may also be getting an empty case.  Once I have the replacement item w/ all discs, I'll change this to 5 stars since I liked the show.

As promised, this review has been changed from 1 star to 5 stars following receipt (on Christmas Eve), of the replacement item sent by Amazon in 2 days...great going Amazon!  Not only does the replacement set contain all 4 DVDs of the complete series, but it also came in a prismatic slip case with the front and back case art reproduced.

I'm so glad Gotham got the go-ahead, because this show would have been a huge case for just canning the whole idea completely.

2888120,4,B000SMNL92,"Actually this one snuck up on me by being a good show.  The acting is top notch.  For a show that was on 12-13 years ago, it's pretty good given the Freshman cast.  The storyline develops over the course of the ""season"" quite well.

The cast revolves around four females (three hero's and one villain).  That's fine; good idea.  Not many people are familiar with Batman's daughter from the comic books.  Now if the cast included Wonder Woman, AquaWoman (or Aqua Girl even), Lois Lane, and Amanda Waller, then it would've been a sure fire hit.

The only bothersome part to the show is the entry fight scene of Batman fighting the Joker...the Joker looks (for lack of a better word) stupid.  Also, Barbara Gordan's wheelchair is sitting way too high and I'm positive it's to accommodate the camera angles.  I mean she is literally sitting in a chair 3 and a half feet off the ground.",1437264000,,881,4.554140127388535
2888121,4,B000SMNL92,It was a great show at the time. The set is good the only thing keeping me from saying great is due to the changes in the audio. The main theme song is different. The song I'd start a revolution by Amy Alan not being used due to license agreement or what have you changes the feel of the show. If you didn't see it when it first aired then it won't bother you.

2888174,5,B000SMNL92,"Batman's little girl is grown up and has to be when Batman is nowhere to be found in Gotham for a long time. Batman and Catwoman got a little too close once and had a daughter. She calls herself Huntress(famous DC character). She is a member of a ""Gotham Trio"" along with a teenage girl named Dinah who is the youngest in age and is very psychic. Batgirl, after being crippled by the Joker years earlier and is now bound to a wheelchair, has renamed herself Oracle(no Matrix connections intended), a shockingly similar character to Chloe Sullivan(hacker and cyber expert with borderline superhuman computer skills) on the TV series Smallville(Superman before he moved to Metropolis from Smallville). The set is also surprisingly similar to Smallville's ""Lookout Tower"" where Chloe Sullivan ran the supercomputer. Birds of Prey had the set idea first by several years however. Smallville probably just picked up on the idea and since both shows are made by DC, so what? To sum up this show, if you like the female characters of Batman fame like Catwoman, Batwoman, Batgirl, or the Huntress, this will easily satisfy your craving for sexy women who kick them a lot of criminal rear end!",1408752000,,1184,4.866336633663367

2888183,4,B000SMNL92,"This was a slick, well written, well plotted series, with excellent performances and great action sequences. It starred the always delightful Dina Meyer, as well as new comers Ashley Scott and Rachel Skarsten. Loosely based on the DC comic team headed by Barbara Gordon after being paralyzed by the Joker in ""The Killing Joke,"" re-told with a more tragic outcome in this alternate DC Universe, wherein Batman has left Gotham, the heroins of Birds of Prey protect New Gotham from crime, both street level and super powered.

This was the WB's attempt at expanding the super hero franchise already gaining popularity with Smallville, before they were the CW. This would likely explain why Birds boasts a cast that is ""CW hot,"" with a soundtrack from the hottest up and coming musical acts of the day, and to be fair, the production is extremely slick. The series also featured cameos by Batman, Cat Woman, and the Joker... at least in the opening credits. And there is a continuing sub-plot with Harley Quinn as a Psychiatrist with a dark agenda to rebuild the Joker's empire.

The unfortunate truth is it failed to find an audience among the fan boys and Dawson's Creek devotees that built the network into a real contender. In it's original airings, the show was frequently pre-empted for other programs, and was decidedly hard to catch when it did air. Thankfully, the CW has revised its policy, and maintains a reputation as a network that will give shows more than a fair shake.  This, of course, comes too late for the ill-fated Birds of Prey. :(

The painful irony of Birds is that with the inception of the New 52 in DC Comics, the sort of alternate storyline that provides the basis for Birds is not uncommon. In the current continuity, Huntress is the daughter of Batman of an alternate earth, and is paired with Power Girl.  Black Canary remains a core member of the super team, but Oracle is now Batgirl, the Killing Joke timeline having been obliterated by the arrival of the new continuity.

Perhaps what brought the end of the show was the fact that it was Batman without Batman.  As a hardcore, long-time comic book fan, I have great appreciation for the show, but a mainstream audience would likely be lost in New Gotham. Still, without the Birds of Prey helping lay the ground work for a superhero series on an upstart network (ABC's attempt with the 1990's The Flash notwithstanding), we might not have had the series that followed. Current cash cow: Arrow, and the upcoming CW treatment of the Scarlet Speedster might never have found a home were it not for a small but loyal group of fans who watched, loved, and maybe even clamored for more.

Many comic book and comic book adaptation fans may grind their teeth when they hear the series mentioned, I read where it made the list of worst comic book adaptations ever, but the series has its charm.",1402272000,6,2866,4.706586826347305
2888184,4,B000SMNL92,"One is a former police commissioners daughter, a computer genius, in a wheel chair. Another is the ofspring of Batman and Catwomen, and finally the daughter of the Black Canary. Mix them together and you get a TV series with women who kick butt in the style of the first batman movies.  Alot of fu, to watch, very entertaining.",1402185600,,327,4.5423728813559325
2888185,4,B000SMNL92,"I have been a Batman fan since I was a boy.  I see almost everything that is Batman related.  So it is surprising that I didn't know about ""Birds of Prey"" for so long.  This short-lived, but great series ended back in 2003, yet I wasn't aware of its existence until several months ago.  How did I not know about this show for over a decade?  Furthermore, I'm at a loss to understand how it was cancelled after just one season.  I found ""Birds of Prey"" to be entertaining, addicting, and just plain fun.

I want to specifically boast about the cast.  Ashley Scott is the main star of the show and she is fantastic as Helena Kyle A.K.A. Huntress.  Rachel Skarsten is Dinah.  For the sake of not revealing any spoilers, I'll simply state that Dinah goes on an emotional roller coaster and Rachel captures all these emotions magnificently.

Barbara Gordon A.K.A. Oracle is played by Dina Meyer.  There are some casting choices that are nothing less than perfect, where the actor makes the casting director like a genius; this is one of those instances.  Dina Meyer is truly perfect as Barbara/Oracle.  She is spot on in her portrayal.

I would be remiss if I didn't also mention Mia Sara's performance as Harley Quinn.  In this version, Harley does her evil acts under the guise of the respected psychiatrist Harleen Quinzell, similar to Lex Luther masquerading as an upstanding citizen.  Mia Sara blew me away with her performance.  She is, in my opinion, the best representation of Harley Quinn.  This is a Harley that is very bright, devious, and lethal.  Again, Mia brings her to life masterfully.

The fact of the matter is I could go on and on talking about the various fascinating aspects of this show, but I want to keep this review on the shorter side.  So let me just sum it up this way: I bought ""Birds of Prey"" because I wanted to see Batman and Catwoman's daughter in action.  She didn't disappoint me; neither did the show as a whole.  I found this series to be riveting.  If you're on the fence on whether you should get this product or not, let me encourage you to take the leap and give it a shot.",1401753600,3,2110,4.489473684210527
2888186,5,B000SMNL92,"From the producers of Smallville, this tv show so far is awesome, I've watched a couple episodes, too bad it was cancelled after one season, it was promising with over 7 million watching the first episode.",1400198400,,205,4.722222222222222
2888187,4,B000SMNL92,"Had not watched the entire set yet. But has a good plot and good performers, I glad I bought it.",1399420800,,96,3.85
2888188,3,B000SMNL92,"There was great potential here. The story's premise (which is said in the beginning of every episode) really gives way for a great show. I really think the show was too early for its time. If it was made today and came off of the Arrow series, than it will be mega popular. It would be like what they did with Vampire Diaries and The Originals.

Of course, this show had a lot of problems that must be address and fixed. First off, the whole idea of Huntress not wanting to wear a mask and wanting to keep her secret identity a secret was ridiculous. That was brought up and said 3 or 4 times in the whole series. It was just too many times to bring up and she should had realized after the second time, she needs to find a way to cover up her secret identity. I know the creators probably didn't want her to wear a mask because it will take away from her looks, but it didn't need to be a full on head gear or anything. She could had just wore something small over her eyes and I would say she would still look pretty hot that way.

I didn't like how the whole love affair with Huntress and detective Jessie. They got together way too fast. They should had saved it for later on into the season and just kept on building more attraction and interest with each other. It felt like Huntress was way more attracted to Jessie than the other way around.

At the very end of the show, it didn't seem like the whole series was connecting very well. I remember Barbara Gordan saying, they finally figured out who was the Big Bad that was causing all the trouble. Meaning they were looking for a particular crime boss, but this was the very first time they said anything about it. Every episode felt like their own individual stories and there was nothing connecting all the episodes together as one big season. When exactly did they figured out their was a boss? When did they start looking for her? We, the audience, knew who she was, and we knew what she was doing. But, it felt odd that they knew there was a big bad, but never said anything about it to the audience. To me, it looked like they were just going out every night and stopping whatever evil that came along that night. How did they figured out there was someone making orders and controlling everything?

To conclude, I feel this show did some good things. They started a great story and loved how they showed off what super heroes and super villains would look like in live action. They gave it a good shot at what source material they had to use back then. Now, what I didn't like was the scripts for the episodes. All they really needed to do was connect the shows together and make people want to follow every show. Instead, it felt very dull and boring. A person could pretty much just watch a few shows and wouldn't be interested in it anymore. Honestly, I myself didn't want to watch more than a few shows after a while, but I was determined to finish it. It was just that short of a series to be done and over with. lol

I only recommend this, if you want to see a short series and don't mind how every show seems unrelated to each other except for the same main characters going out and finding bad guys to punch.",1398124800,,3181,4.259933774834437

Shame that the aspect ratio of the episodes in the set is full frame, but with a little help you can zoom in, and watch without problems. Most of the TV sets these days crop the black lines away automaticly. The only reason why I get away one star is, that they removed the Themesong. I understand that they removed the crappy TATU music, but the main theme ?? What they gave the fans is a bit kinda like ""Teenager"" Theme, what takes a bit away the darkness of the show (And does not realy fit in there as well). But when you dig deeper, you find out why. The Song ""Revolution "" was made for the TV Show and in 2007 Warner Bros. lost the license for the music and till this day, nobody knows where the rights are for the song. Okay, fine, I can live with it, but there are way better Songs then the one they use, to replace the theme.

Dina Meyer doesn't play paraplegic very well though; she keeps leaning in her wheelchair such as she wouldn't be able to do with a real spinal injury, but this is a minor quibble.

2888217,5,B000SMNL92,"I wasn't expecting much from this show and I was blown away by it. The premise surprisingly hooked me instantly and that was just the first good thing. The show got all kinds of things right, the acting was very well acted and felt legit, I felt for these characters a lot, the development was impressive and didn't feel rushed or unexpected (discussed later), episode tones differed (mystery, more action, emotional based, intro, backstory's coming back), the villains felt menacing, I got the old dark feel from late night Gothem, Resse's character was used surprisingly well and the backstory felt very plausable. I had a great time watching this.

That being said there are some nitpicks. A few evening shots look blue screened but in a way I like it that way. Many action scenes are just sped up from normal time, this didn't bother me except for the finale were every action scene was like this. The character development was rushed during the finale along with the whole finale (but given that the show had been canceled it was to be expected). Some plot bits or development are predictable but it was still fun seeing if I was proven right. Finally episode 3's mystery killer (DETAILED SPOILER AHEAD) was so obvious zooming on Commander Shepard's face when he says ""Makes them blind to what's, (Zoom) right in front of their face"". Great job of not making the bad guy obvious.

Still it was a surprising success for me and I'm very happy to own this. Too bad it couldn't have gone on. It was worth another season's worth but that would've been it.",1358899200,,1555,4.671532846715328
2888218,5,B000SMNL92,"The thirteen episodes of the gone too soon Birds of Prey series are more than welcome in this collection. The series adapted elements of the characters into a character driven series revolving around three primary players. Helena Kyle, as played by Ashley Scott, was the daughter of Batman and Catwoman, waging her own campaign against crime and following in her father's footsteps. Her mentor and partner, Barbara Gordon (a sympathetic Dina Meyer), once Batgirl before being crippled by the Joker, was Oracle, a computer mastermind running the operation. And Dinah (Rachel Skarsten), a runaway and the daughter of the Black Canary, was the newcomer just learning about her powers. Add in a mix of villains through the series with many of them having their strings pulled by Harley Quinn (a deliciously sadistic Mia Sara), and supporting characters like Alfred Pennyworth (wisely played by Ian Abercrombie) and cop Jesse Reese (Shemar Moore), and you had the makings of a good show.

It's a shame that the series was ended before its time; the use of three headlining women in such a strong way was welcome, and the characters had depth and personality. The premise played around with various aspects and eras of the DC universe- the Huntress being Helena Kyle predates the mid-eighties Crisis, whereas the Birds of Prey concept and Harley Quinn were post Crisis. The three leads are likeable in their own ways, giving their performances a certain strength, while staying true to who each of them are. Much, much better than the Smallville series which was around at the same time. It's a different spin on the Batman universe, but a welcome one.

The fights were believable, and the comic relief was well timed. It had Villians to both love and hate.  It had an energizing theme song, and powerful battle music.  This was a series to love.

Was excited when it finally came out on DVD, only to find it was altered for DVD.  The background music had been changed for several fight scenes, including the final battle.  Worse the Theme Song was changed.  The Changed fight scenes music doesn't work with the actions of the characters, and the changed Theme should be a a cure for insomnia.

The TV series is 5 stars, this DVD set barely deserves 3.",1353110400,2,720,4.650793650793651

2888229,3,B000SMNL92,"I guess you can say this show was OK when you consider all of the obstacles that Warner Bros. put in its way.

First Warner Bros. allowed the producers to use the Joker and the Batman in the pilot, but then pulled away permission to use Batman and all of the DC villains when the show went into production.  This caused a major problem for the writers since Batman was suppose to make guest appearances to help out and the ladies were suppose to take on some of their old foes from the comic books.  That's why the episodes kept flashing back to the 60-second Batman/Joker sequence from the pilot.  The writers had hoped to attract Batman fans to the show.  The change forced it into a run-of-the-mill ""mutant of the week"" series like Smallville's earlier seasons.

Secondly, the producers wanted to shoot in Vancouver where they planned to use the 30% cost savings for a bigger CGI budget.  Warner Bros. forced them to shoot in LA without giving them a larger budget, and the producers had to use the same CGI sequences, such as a CGI Ashley Scott running across the same rooftop, over and over again.

Thirdly, Warner Bros. told the producers they didn't like the Harley Quinn character and had her written out of the show.  Again, Harley Quinn was an important part of the writers' plans and they had to get rid of her.  Then surprisingly, when Warner cancelled the show, the studio told the producers it wanted the Harley Quinn story arc to be wrapped up for the show's eventual DVD sales.  Back came Harley Quinn in the final two episodes, and also the series' best episodes as Harley Quinn evolves into the supervillain Harlequin.

Ironically, this wasn't the first series Warner Bros. had interfered with.  1990's series The Flash also had to deal with the problem of not being able to use any of the Flash's trademarked supervillains.  Only at the end did DC allow Mark Hamill to play the Trickster, but it was too late to save the show from cancellation.

Birds of Prey could have been much more if WB hadn't wimped out!",1327881600,7,2029,4.581717451523546
2888230,5,B000SMNL92,"I loved the show when it first aired on TV and was sad to see it get cancelled. I'm glad it was released on DVD because now I can watch it whenever I feel like it. There are just two things that really annoy me from the DVD. Some music differs from original televised version including the theme song, which in the original airing was ""Revolution"" by Aimee Allen, as well as the fight music ""All the Things She Said"" by t. A.T.u. in the final episode which was replaced with ""Beautiful Freak"" by Dirty Children. The new theme song just doesn't sit well with me. It doesn't go with the type of show that it is. I really wish they would have left the music as it was when it aired on television. Other than that, I have no complaints.",1325289600,2,732,4.198581560283688
2888231,3,B000SMNL92,"I totally missed this when it aired, so my first experience was this DVD set. As some other reviews say, this show feels like unfulfilled potential. It's such a cool premise, and at least some of the cast are so good in their roles, that I find myself wishing that it had not been canceled so early in its run. This show functioned as a good complement/counterbalance to Smallvile, including the dark, Gotham color palette and the female lead character. In fact, all three of the central characters here are female (and fairly positive role models for any young girls watching). All of that being said, the overall quality of the show is a bit low, so I can perhaps understand why its flight was so brief.

First, Ashley Scott kicks as Huntress - very cool. I also like Dina Meyer as Barbara Gordon/Oracle/Batgirl. For me, those are the two bright spots in terms of cast. The detective guy works pretty well, too. The writing feels a bit odd/forced to me in many of the episodes, which in turn makes the acting awkward. Also, the sets and special effects seem kind of cheap, including the main title segment that repeats at the start of each episode. And I have to say, the ""Clayface"" episode is just painful, what with his very exaggerated accent and bizarrely-written story. However, I do appreciate the effort to include many characters from the Batman mythology.

I almost gave this four stars, due to the set itself, which is a very good package. The actual episodes of BoP get the three stars, and I felt that I should stick with that rating. The price is quite good for a ""complete series,"" and the inclusion of three seasons worth of the Gotham Girls web-series was a great idea. You get a bunch of short episode-ettes featuring all of the Bat-verse's main female characters (Batgirl, Poison Ivy, Catwoman, Harley Quinn, etc.) in charmingly animated and frequently funny little stories. Overall, Birds of Prey is not the greatest thing that I have ever seen, but it is halfway decent viewing in a great package, and if you think that you might like the idea of Batman-related characters in a Smallvile-type show, it is worth checking out.",1323561600,,2146,4.689655172413793

Whew!  I tried to sum up the concept in one sentence and that's the best I could do.  And that's the first problem the series has, with three second-generation heroes there's a lot of back story that has to be dumped on viewers to get them up to speed.

And once we are up to speed... we get a series of Monster of the Week stories build around the premise that evil Metahumans are trying to take back New Gotham for the Joker's old moll Harley Quinn.

Stars Ashley Scott, Dina Meyer and Rachel Skarsten do a decent job but the scripts soon become repetitive.  The show is not quite dramatic enough to make me care, nor is it campy enough to make me laugh.  It's just sort of there.",1321747200,,984,4.403314917127072
2888233,2,B000SMNL92,"Being a DC fan I bought this show on a whim, I've always liked the characters of Huntress and Oracle so I thought a live action Birds of Prey show would be great. My wife loves watching shows with girls that kick ass, so all signs pointed to this being a win win.
Unfortunately this show falls heavily short. The dialog is laughable at times, and the production flip flops between complete camp like the old 60's batman, and trying to be very dark and deep like a modern drama.
I managed to watch the first 4 episodes before completely giving up on this series. Although it did have some promising story elements like fighting for meta human rights, and having Harley Quin take center stage, it just kept coming off as painful to watch over all.
The acting varied all over the place, while I really liked Barbara Gordon (Oracle), I found Huntress annoying.
This show had so much potential to be really good, you had great characters to base off of, and an extensive history of storie's to draw from, it's like they took all the best and freshest ingrediants to make a beatiful meal and then left it in the oven about 3 hours to long and left all the seasoning out.",1320278400,,1164,4.4186046511627906
2888234,4,B000SMNL92,"Being a hardcore Batman fan, I'm amazed at the fact I'm just now finding out about this show. Having seen it a million times on the shelf since its' release, I finally picked it up just to see what Birds of Prey was about. When I found out it was about The Gotham Girls, I was sold. I bought it. After giving it a watch, I can honestly say- the showed had alot of promise. There was plenty of action, lots of eyecandy, and pretty good acting.

However, I know I'm being critical here, where the show lacked for me was when it showed flashbacks. If you look at the show as a whole, they really went out with FX at times yet, when they did the flashbacks, it look like a couple of amateurs made it with costumes rented out from a local costume shop. Why? Heck, even you could see through the fighting choreography.

Nitpicks aside, it did get reasonably better by the end of the series. I do believe, if it were given more time on television with more seasons, the show would have grown into something much more worthy of the Batman mythos. That's something I can't understand...why can't these networks let shows have, at least, two seasons to really get its' stride and show what it can do? That happens alot, especially when it comes to superhero/sci-fi type shows(like one of my favorites, Batman Beyond). At it stands, though, this show didn't get a chance to and this is all we have.

Do I think it is worth a purchase? Yes and No. Yes, especially for all the Batman fans or fans of the Gotham Girls. No, for anyone else...you'll probably find this show pretty boring because you won't have a clue as to why things are the way they are in the show when Batman should be there.

As it stands, Birds of Prey is an awesome show. I really enjoyed it and will probably enjoy repeated viewings of it. I just love me some Dina Meyer. ;)",1313712000,,1833,4.319767441860465
2888235,1,B000SMNL92,"I watched an episode or two of this series when it first came on TV and hated it. Fast forward to NOW and I picked up the entire series, feeling maybe I didn't give it a fair shake. I watched EVERY episode. And now I can tell you with certainty that it is terrible.
I don't care about the liberties taken with the characters. And I LOVE the characters. I own most of the comic series. But you can't make a TV show (or movie) without changing stuff around to make it accessible to the general public.
What I SERIOUSLY cared about was how badly this show was put together. Yeah, the two intros were annoying every episode, but that's why God invented the fast forward button. What cheesed me off was that the show didn't even hold its own continuity through the series. In the first episode, Joker kills Helena's mom and then shoots Babs before Batman can get to her. THEN, later in the series, it turns out that Clayface killed Helena's mom and Babs knew about it. Huh? And, speaking of Clayface, his make-up job was literally a dude with mud smeared all over his face. The special effects were terrible. The ironic thing is that Clayface is in this elaborate sealed chamber in a room straight out of Silence of the Lambs (he even does the quid pro quo thing with Huntress) but the set looked expensive and the character looked like he got a five minute, five dollar make-up job. Makes no sense. What makes even LESS sense is that they shot every fight scene in every episode in slow motion, giving you a REALLY good look at the stunt doubles faces as they kicked and punched and flipped around. And, in most cases, they barely resembled the main actresses. And, swear to Robin, some of the stunt doubles was DUDES.
Skip it. Mia Sara was over the top and the only bright spot in this series. I can see cute girls in skin tight clothes pout and pose elsewhere and with much better production values.",1300924800,11,1897,4.407407407407407

2888237,1,B000SMNL92,"Batman & Cat Woman had a daughter who is the Huntress and the main focus of the series. I love Batman and superheroes in general. I've followed the Batman legacy intently and this follows it to, but this series has major flaws.

 - First off, this feels more like Dawson's Creek or a typical WB show. Especially with the generic female sang pop rock music.
 - All female cast. Aren't there any men in this world? Well yes there are men, but they play villains and side story love interests.
 - A main character cop that wants to know a superhero's name. This is a superhero that doesn't wear a mask. Oh and this cop is a COP! He has the authority to demand ID. If he didn't have that authority, he can probably look at newspaper photos and see oh that's Selina Kyle's daughter. Duh! She was there when her mom was stabbed to death in the street (like Bruce Wayne's father was shot).
 - These aren't super heroes. They're metahuman with metapowers. They hang out at the metabar. There's a meta killer killing metahumans. They use the word meta so often that its bad comedy.
 - Its interesting seeing 2 attractive white women say the other doesn't understand what its like being a different race... The meta race.
 - The thing that made Batman stand out was the fact that no one had superpowers. Everyone in Batman's world was a human that was either really smart or abnormally athletic.
 - This feels like I'm watching an all female X-Men, because EVERYONE has Metapowers... except Barbra Gordon who is in a wheelchair, just like professor X. Especially because she teaches at a school...
 - So with Barbra as a HS teacher in the series, that's the perfect setup for the third Bird of Prey who is a 16 year old girl. So there's a lot of HS. This is a staple of WB made programming. Gilmore Girls, Smallville, Dawson's Creek. Even the Terminator series was produced by WB (but aired on Fox) and had a high school. Who am I to complain about this? Teens read comics, they're just shooting for their target audience... If they aired the Golden Girls, all 4 of them would be teachers at a HS.
 - The before mentioned 16 year old saves the day at the end of a lot of episodes. I'm sure Robin saved the day too, but not after every hour long episode. It just feels cheap.
 - The special effects are laughable, but hey what do you expect?
 - There's CGI when there doesn't really need to be. Sure there's CGI cut scenes, that's understandable, but where its not needed is having Huntress running on the top of buildings in CGI.
 - Two openings. So they kick off each episode with a spiel about how this is Batman & Cat Woman's daughter. Then they have an intro into the story. Then they have a second opening... What?
 - The general public doesn't seem to know who Batman is and the series takes place 7 years after he retired. I'm sure if there were news reports of a vigilante dressed as a bat saving the city from super villains, you'd remember.
 - There are so many bad fight scenes where Huntress is usually down close to the ground with one hand touching the pavement, her legs parted and then her head flips back and she looks straight toward her adversary. Its so bad and lame.
 - I keep watching it and laughing every 2 minutes as I tell myself, this is so bad.
 - The DVD set also comes with an animated web comic called Gotham Girls. These consist of 10 or so episodes, each running a minute or two. They have the voice actors from the Batman Animated Series which is nice.

This is clearly a bad TV show. I have a feeling people love this show because it vaguely involves Batman... or its for the attractive ladies.",1298332800,9,3619,4.3841554559043345

2888243,3,B000SMNL92,"I decided to pick up this set because I remembered that when it aired there were a few interesting nuggets to take away from this essentially flawed show.  Perhaps the greatest disappointment for me was that the theme music on the DVD isn't Aimee Allen's 'Revolution'.  Instead they've replaced it with a lame Gilmore Girls/Dawson Creek style piece.  'Revolution' had a ballsy edge to it that set the tone for show.  I think Warner cheaped out and didn't want to pay for the original music and really ... it wasn't Madonna or Bono ... how expensive could it have been?

For too many years networks and film execs were deathly afraid of putting out superhero fare unless they watered it down to the point at which it hardly resembled the source material.  Birds of Prey was no different.  No costumes, no secret identities and a mish-mash of DC continuity thrown in here and there was what aired.

The hardest aspect of this series to swallow was the constant denials and protests from New Gotham citizens and police that metahumans and even the Batman himself ... exist.  It was like they had to apologize to the audience for the source material.  It also bothered the crap out of me that Huntress could turn on 'cat-like' powers and dive off of skyscrapers even though neither one of her parents was metahuman.

The actors and some of the cameos, like the original Black Canary, are what makes this watchable.  Given more time and a stonger premise, this one could've been a keeper.",1282867200,3,1483,4.683397683397684

Centering around Oracle aka Barbara Gordon, the Huntress aka Helena Kyle and Dinah, daughter of the Black Canary, the show follows these three women as they fight against the criminals of New Gotham while trying to work together as a team.

I had never heard of this TV series until I saw it on DVD and as a Batman fan, I had to add it to my collection of Batman related DVDs.  While I enjoyed the acting of the cast, I was on the whole not overly impressed with the show itself.  I found some of the episodes way too predictable while I found other things quite implausible.  I don't think that Dectective Reese would be that ignorant of the Batman, especially given his background.  There are some other things that I could nit pick on, but that would spoil it for those who have yet to see this show.

I think this show would have had a lot of potential to grow in future seasons of the show, given half the chance.

I'm sorry the show didn't last it had great energy and life the characters were fresh not stale to me,so if you want a good show with action check out the Birds!!!",1259625600,,430,4.192771084337349
2888251,3,B000SMNL92,"You can almost visualize the board meetings where Warner Brothers and DC discussed the possibility of making Birds of Prey a broadcast television reality:  ""We need a project to appeal to the highly successful primetime teenage drama segment, something like Smallville only less um, Super.""

And once that logic settles in, the beauty of selecting Birds of Prey as the source material for a heavily female-based action drama becomes apparent.  It would really require minimal tweaking to mold into a moody crime-solver piece (ala CSI or Law & Order) with a healthy dosage of hormones, melodrama, and action sequences thrown in for good measure.

However, before taking it all at face value remember that the source material (at least in the comic medium) wasn't nearly as cut and dry as the show's intro would have you believe.  The character of Huntress (played here by Ashley Scott) was actually developed back in the mid 1970s as a sort of ""what if"" that would be set in Batman mythology but in a alternate universe called Earth-Two.  The idea was simply to present the outlandish proposition that what if Bruce Wayne were to have offspring with a reformed Selena Kyle (Catwoman)?  Their daughter would probably have quite an attitude, not to mention a penchant for kicking major butt.  Taking the ""what if"" theme a bit further, let's look ahead to when Batman basically retires so as to pass on the proverbial torch of Gotham City's dark defender to said daughter.

The concept was sound enough (and about on par with a much later, slightly different ""what if"" scenario known as Batman Beyond) and probably would have been lost to the recesses of time forever if not for a 1996 reintroduction through Chuck Dixon's comic project Birds of Prey which featured Barbara Gordon (Oracle) and Dinah Lance (Black Canary) as a super heroine duo.

Huntress didn't make an appearance until 2003 under Gail Simone's supervision.  The scenario featured a critically wounded Black Canary who relies upon Huntress and Oracle's combined efforts to be set free.  In celebration of their success, the ladies decide to form a trio.

The show mixes and matches a few of the comic ideals (especially noteworthy is the fact that since it was produced in 2002, Huntress as a member of the team actually precedes the comic thread).  Other changes include the setting New Gotham as opposed to Earth-Two and the rather than Huntress being an established heroine who happens to join forces with pre-established Oracle (as in the comics), here we have Barb Gordon taking Helene Kyle in at a young age and basically raising her as her own.

Here the trio is rounded out with Dinah Redmond (played by Rachel Skarsten), who is said to be the daughter of the original Black Canary. Here's where things get a little sticky even to the comic book geeks: While Dinah Redmond is in fact the television version of comic book character Dinah Lance, she is never actually known as Black Canary in the show.  In the comics Dinah Lance was the second Black Canary (after her mother, who just so happens to also be named Dinah- Dinah Drake).  Confused yet? Me too.  All you really need to know is that here we have the paralyzed Barb Gordon as oracle, Helena Kyle (Bruce and Selena's love child) as Huntress and a young/ inexperienced Dinah Redmond (pre-Black Canary) as the trio known as the Birds of Prey.

Unofficially you could say there's a fourth member in Bruce's kind-hearted butler, Alfred Pennyworth (played by none other than Ian Abercrombie, perhaps best known as Seinfeld's Mr. Pitt).  On the fringe of membership is the made-for-tv character of Detective Jesse Reese (played by Shemar Moore) who, in addition to being an honest cop, happens to have a little love interest in Huntress.

The prime antagonist of the show is Paul Dini's (DCAU) character contribution, Dr. Harleen Quinzel (Harley Quinn) played by Mia Sara- yes Mathew Broderick's main squeeze, Sloane Petersen on Ferris Bueller's Day Off!!

Consisting of 13-episodes and coming in at a total runtime of 737 minutes, Birds of Prey spans 4 discs and comes equipped with two special features: The unaired pilot episode (which is basically cut up into segments and used throughout the season) and the entire 30-epsiode run of the animated DCAU web series, Gotham Girls.

The show's main structure consists of crime-driven stand-alone adventures with slight mystery undertones. The girls play off each other's personalities to solve each case but not before succumbing to estrogen-induced drama, some high school romance bits, and a whole lot of John Woo-esque butt kicking.

The acting choices are pretty spot-on but I may be a bit biased on account of the fact that the lean form of Ashley Scott in tight leather is enough to tickle any red-blooded American male's fancy and Dina Meyer has undeniable charming hotness as Oracle/ Barbara.

Harley Quinn was a bit of an odd choice as lead villain however simply because of the timeline.  The tale supposedly takes place well-after Joker's apparent manipulation of her gray matter and while we hear that she was once a successful psychotherapist prior to ""Mr. J's"" influence, she is far from the clown-like floozy the DCAU made famous.  In fact she's quite a cold-hearted manipulator in this portrayal, which, though convincing, really does the ditsy source character injustice.

For those individuals hoping for an opportunity to witness some of their favorite classic DC rogues, Lady Shiva and Clayface get the nod throughout the 13-episode run but heavy hitters like the Joker are used only in an out-of-focus intro flashback and in reference.

 Music choices are a little too period trendy to appeal to viewers of all ages but I suspect that teenagers tuning in to the show back in 2002 were quite delighted to hear their favorite Top-40 numbers used in the application.

I must confess that a big part of the appeal of this particular box set came in the form of the inclusion of the complete Gotham Girls animated series.  The first two seasons are certainly the weakest in terms of animation quality and simplistic story lines but the third and final season makes up for it by offering one complete ongoing tale involving many of the characters from the impeccable Batman: The Animated Series (including the original voice actors).  Each season is about a half-hour long (what would be considered a single episode usually) but they are a nice treat for the DCAU fan simply because they are available nowhere else.

In all Birds of Prey is best when viewed as a soap opera with superhero and action elements laced in rather than as a superhero tale with occasional drama.  The show was clearly slanted to capture the attention of the 18-34 demographic with special attention given to appeal to teen fans of shows like Smallville (which had been nominated for multiple Teen Choice Awards).  The trouble is that despite reaching nearly double the amount of viewers, Birds of Prey lasted only 13-episodes (a single season) opposed to Smallville's 181 episodes/ 9-season run.  Sometimes television, like life, simply isn't fair.",1257638400,2,7113,4.947058823529412

1.  It was complete; and
2.  Excellent reviews.

However, I wish I had watched some of the episodes before I purchased it.  Although, the stories have their moments, they move and stop as if a commercial is about to come.  Also the actors sometimes are too aware that they are being filmed and watching them feels as if they are looking in a mirror for a rehearsal!  Also some of the themes like romantic connections between the characters either gets hung up until several episodes later or just drag on and on and on...

I would recommend borrowing the compilation from a local library.  The stories are at times enjoyable, acting is at times natural, but ultimately they are forgettable.",1256601600,2,734,4.716535433070866

I made a point to be home every wednesday night to watch it on the CW and was shocked to learn that it was cancelled after only one season.  This series was based on the Comic book Birds of Pray that centered around Helena Kyle, daughter to catwoman and batman and known as Huntress - and her struggle to clean up the city of New Gotham along with Oracle (otherwise known as Batgirl) and Dina (the daughter of the the Black Canary who has powers that rival Jean Grey)  Yeah, and the Big Bad they are always looking for just happens to be Harlene Quinzel ( otherwise known as Harley Quinn) and who also happens to be Helena's Shrink.

I've always preferred this storyline in which Batman and Catwoman have a child, but the main issue with the show was the EXTREMELY low budget and they didn't give Huntress a mask, that could have basically given her the mask Black Cat wears and it would have worked. Without the secret Identity Factor the hero plot failed. The first episode, and the last are probably the best. Um hated Black Canary's daughter, but she had cool powers but the actress sucked. I mean if you like batman, buy this, Batman was suppose to guest star in the second season if they had one, but the show wasn't give a chance and they just goofed on the secret identity. Wish they would revamp the show with many corrections, the concept has such great potential. Owell I still re-watch the episodes, they tend to be a little cheesy, but oracle wears the Batgirl costume quite a few times in the show and the costume looked great, not cheesy at all.

2888256,3,B000SMNL92,"First off a bit of explination.

There is more then one version of the Huntress. one version is the daughter of Bruce Wayne (Batman) and Selena Kyle (Catwoman), who are married. their daughter is Helena Wayne. After the tragic death of Catwoman Helena becomes the Huntress a vigilanti in the spirit of both her parents. I rather like this verison. for one thing Im a sucker for Batman and Catwoman getting together.

That version was erased. Another version is Helena the daughter of a mob boss. her family is killed and she becomes the Huntress. this version joins the Birds of Prey. which consists of Black Canary and Oracle. Oracle is Barbra Gordon after she has been shot and paralized.

this series is loosly based off the comics but it adapts differant elements. I have to say I rather like the result.

however.. i don't entirly like the meta human angle. as i see it to much as DC's version of Marvels mutants and Xmen.
allthough it was nice that they gave a nodd to Smallville, sugesting metahumans could be created by falling metors.
moving on..

here Helena Kyle is the illagitamit child of Bruce and Selena. Helena is also half meta human. her mother being a full meta human. Helena has half her mother's powers. having catlike reflexes and movements. Bruce seems unaware he has a daughter. Catwoman reformed to raise her daughter.

the Batman was fighting a war on crime against the Joker. Batman destroys his empire. in revenge the Joker sends a man to kill Catwoman. helena watches helplessly as her mother is stabbed. she is left alone in the world. menwhile the Joker hunts down Barbra Gordon who is Batgirl. he then shoots her (in a nodd to The Killing Joke). by the by its nice that they got Mark Hammil to voice the Joker for the pilot. he had already voiced the charture in the animated series. he is the best voice for the joker. Barbra is left paralized and becomes Oracal a wizard at computers and 'master of the cyber realms'. at the same time young Dinah is a meta human powers who sees the tragic death of Catwoman and Barbra's shooting. Dinah is reveild to be the daughter of Black Canary. Barbra raises Helena while she is teaching at a school. Barbra also trains her. Helena becomes the Huntress. when older Dinah seeks out both of them and they become the Birds of Prey. batman in the mentime has dissapeared without a trace. the joker is also gone. gotham is a new place swamped with crime. only the Birds of Prey are left to defend the city. however there is one major crime lord left a remnent of the Joker's rule. she is Harlen Quinzel or Harley Quinn (played very well by Mia Sara). by day she is a psychartrist, by night she plots to destroy the city. she wants to set down the very city that her love, the Joker, wanted to destroy himself.  (So far this is the only live action version of Harly Quinn, and quit a good one I thought).

there are only thirteen episodes to this series. sadly it was canceled. which is a shame all the actors did a good job they had such potential. all the stories may not be great but some were good. it was an all to brief series, but a good one.

the episodes...
-Begining.
We are introduced the main chartures. including Detecitve Jesse Reese who meets the Huntress. Alfred is present. we meet Wade a teacher with a thing for Barbra. meantime a deadly meta human is in town and the Birds of Prey hunt him down. (the pilot was reshot, the orginal with a differnt Harley. its just as well Sara is much better in the role).
-Slick
Slick a metahuman is hunting down cops with a hidden agenda. the Huntress seeks to hunt him down and stop him. both are trying to learn more about Dinah who so far has not been honest about her past.
-Prey for the Hunter
Helena and Reese clash when tracking down a killer. Reese feels he can not trust her which causes a rift between them in this case.

-Sins of the Mother

-Primal Scream
Helena goes undercover to catch a gang of theives but she is having too much fun, which could get her into trouble. Dinah is on edge since the death of her mother. filled with rage and anger. (a very good episode for Dinah i thought).
-Split
Darkstrike is in town hunting down a killer. reluctantly Helna joins him, but all is not as it seems. Dinah learns the distrubing truth about the killer they seek.
-Lady Shiva
long ago Barbra fought Lady Shiva and thought she died in an acident. however she survived but her sister did not. shiva is out for revenge. Barbra risks everything to face her. she uses a subnural network to walk for a time, even though it causes he great pain. its up to Helana to stop Barbra. (this was a great episode for Barbras charture. also its the first live action version of Lady Shiva).
-Nature of the Beast
Reese asks Helena to protect a mob boss. however it is the same mob boss responsible for the death of Black Canary. helena is reluctant, espisly when Reese reveals his ties to this mob boss. Dinah however wants revenge.
-Gladiatrix
Metahuman women are being kidnaped and forced to fight. they are given a drug to make them more agressive. helna and Dinah both become captives and subcumb to the drugs effects. they are forced to fight. its up to Barbra and Reese to find the solution.
-Runion
Helena doesnt want to go to her highschool reunion. however a killer is stalking her ex classmates. she is forced to take part in order to find the killer. in the process she becomes fare closer to Reese.
-Feet of Clay
a killer is turning people into clay. Helena seeks out ClayFace still in Arkham to find out more about the killer. in the process she learns the truth about her mother's death. (this is the as yet only live action version of Clay Face. there are elements of the Prester Payne clay face in this story). Barbra and Wade become much closer in this episode.
-Devil Eyes
Harley has learned Helna's secret. she uses a machine to give herself hypnotic powers. she then hypnotises Helena and takes over the Clock Tower. she kills those in her way. gotham is at her command and she sends the city into madness. its up to Barbra and Dinah to captur Helena and bring her to her sensis. then they must captur the Clock Tower and save the city. (this is a very good episode for Harely's charture. Sara shines in her senes).
sadly this was the end of the series.

all in all a good series, not a Great series, but a good one, with good actors and chartures whose potential could have been further explored. a good addition to the Batman legend.

there are a few off moments. the CGI isn't great. epsepicly for the city landscape, some of the lines aren't well written, a few of the actors aren't great, but that dosent mean this series is bad. it has a lot of potential.

one note however, yes indeed the music used when the show was on air is not used for the DVD. unlike some Smallville DVDs the company just didn't seem willing to pay for the rights for the music for the dvd of Brids.

as an added bonus when you buy this DVD your getting not one but two series.
included is Gotham Girls.

Gotham Girls was an online animated feature.
its started out as games
becoming a full storyline.
the complete series of gotham Girls is inculded here.

it featurs Harly Quinn, Poison Ivy, Catwoman, Renne Montoia, and Batgirl. the animation is in the same line as the New adventures of the Batman Animated series. with the same voices.

its a pleasnt additon to this DVD
allthough the two series really are not related, save for a few similur chartures.

so all in all i think this is a DVd worth having.
a very good short series.",1249084800,2,7885,4.426896551724138
2888257,4,B000SMNL92,"The principle actors and several of the guests all did great jobs. Using the term meta-human for a genetic super power, a la X-men, we enjoy a few movies worth of time with the backstory of the mains and some innovative plots wrapped around some more exotic talents.",1244419200,,266,4.5625
2888258,4,B000SMNL92,"I never saw this when it first appeared on the WB a few years ago discovered it for the first time only recently on DVD. This is certainly not a perfect show. It is marred by an intentional attempt to cater for a very young, typical WB audience. The women are all a tad too hip, a tad too well-dressed, their make up just a bit too perfect. There is nothing like what we would later see with Starbuck on BSG, a really tough female hero whose make up wasn't perfect, was attractive but didn't look like a model, and was just a bit over-the-edge. The emotions of the women here on BIRDS OF PREY are not always terribly adult but adolescent. They seem to be intending the show for a younger crowd than a comparable and nearly contemporary show like DARK ANGEL.

Despite this youth orientation, the show still had some nice moments. It was a great role for Ashley Scott, who was free after a recurring role the previous year on DARK ANGEL. She later appear on the hideously overrated cult series JERICHO. I would love to see her get a defining role on a good series. She is beautiful, charismatic, athletic, and has enough presence to carry a series, and she very nearly was able to carry this one. The rest of the cast isn't quite up to her level. Dina Meyer doesn't bring quite enough gravitas to her role as Barbara Gordon aka Oracle, the former Batgirl, now paralyzed and relegated to a wheelchair. The team of the title is rounded out by Rachel Skarsten, who plays Dinah Lance. In the DC Universe this is a tad complicated, because that is the name usually given to Black Canary (maybe my least favorite DC hero, simply because her sonic scream is inevitably absurd when translated to film). But on this show Black Canary is supposed to be her mother. Of course, one of the things about Dinah is that her powers are still supposed to be developing. She has some mind reading abilities (upon contact) and powers of telekinesis, but perhaps she would have gained the Black Canary's cry. Also, she had not yet taken on a crime fighting name by the end of the series. Perhaps she would have morphed into a new Black Canary. It would have made the series title make a bit more sense.

But here is the thing: most shows get better as they go along. BIRDS OF PREY has all the feel of a show that had not yet found its groove. It had no long story arcs under development apart from romances for the two older women. Although Mia Sara is listed each week as the intended villain, she is never really takes off until the finale (which was written after they learned that the series had been cancelled). She, by the way, plays Dr. Harleen Quinzel aka Harley Quinn, who is usually, of course, allied with the Joker. No doubt her role would have grown in the series.

The world that this takes in is rather vague. Or perhaps I haven't read the right books in the DC Universe. Here we see a post-Batman universe. Even though many many familiar super villains are locked up in Arkham Asylum, no one seems to remember Batman or Catwoman. How can they remember Clayface but not Batman? Makes no sense.

All in all, I wish that this had lasted longer. I think it would have developed some interesting story lines.

BTW, on a small side note, according to IMDB.com Bruce Thomas played Batman in the small snippets in which he is seen. Fans of KYLE XY will know him as Stephen Trager, the father in the family that takes in and adopts Kyle.",1244246400,,3421,4.415213946117274

I was jazzed when it was announced, as I am a huge comic book fan and loved the print series with Oracle and the Black Canary.  But in my area reception for the local WB station was dicey and I did not always get a good tape of the episodes.  That, and being a little bummed that Dinah was not the Canary, but her daughter, left me with a tarnished memory of the series.  But Amazon had a good price, and I sampled a couple of episodes from Video on Demand, and I am glad I did.  The series is stylish, intelligently written, and respects its subject matter and viewers.  The casting is excellent, in particular Shemar Moore as Detective Reese and Mia Sara as Harley Quinn.  Early episodes are a little shaky, but it gets way better as it goes along and Harley's plots continue to unfold.  When I finished the set, I was sorry again that there was only one season.

2888266,3,B000SMNL92,"I had so much excitement about getting this show once is was released in the summer. Having never seen it before and loving Smallville, a show by the same producers, I was really eager to love this short-lived show based on the three heroines fighting crime in a Batmanless New Gotham City. I watched the pilot with a few other people. They absolutely hated it, and I decided it was okay and I would continue to watch. The acting was not that hot, even if the main girl, played by Ashley Scott, was, and the visual effects were pretty crappy considering the time. The overall production values weren't horrible but the overlooking shots of New Gotham City looked corny, even though I liked and appreciated the flying, whizzing shots twisting around the buildings and zooming in on an over the top New Gotham Police Department. The writing was shaky, but the overall plotlines of each episode were adequate. I particularly loved the episode called Slick, about the water Metahuman  who drowns people on dry land. Some good effects were used well in this one. But that's the only episode I REALLY liked. The thing is with this show, everything in it is used, nothing really new going on. Metahumans in this. Meteor Freaks and aliens in Smallville. Three strong female heroines, been done in Charmed and countless others. I was really looking forward to this because I love Batman stuff and basically anything superheroish and this show fell considerably short for me. This show is NOT for people who like Batman. I'd recommend this to the younger crowd who aren't as experience in shows like this. Anyone who has seen Buffy, Angel, Charmed, Dark Angel, Batman, Smallville (that mostly) will most likely be rolling their eyes at this even though it does offer small doses of fun, silly action with some fun comic book style production values. Unfortunately, the content of the show doesn't have much value in it. Maybe if it had run a full season or more it would have found a good footing.",1237507200,,1987,4.742774566473988
2888267,3,B000SMNL92,"disappointing.  This show was pulled down by some sloppy writing and some actors that needed a bit more time in acting school.  Dina Meyer was pretty good as Barbara/Oracle, but Ashley Scott was painfully wooden as Huntress.  She wasn't helped by the one-dimensional writing.  Rachel Skarsten was also rather dull.  Again, I don't know if it was the acting or the writing.  The pity is that there was potential in the storyline.  The basic idea was solid (and the comic book was great), but they just seemed afraid to do anything that might be morally grey or interesting.  New character shows up, new character is evil (surprise ... or not, given that every new character was evil), new character dispatched.  Mia Sara's Harley Quinn was interesting, but in many episodes she was not their or barely there.  The relationships between the main characters never got past superficial.  Pity.  This is a might-have-been - worth watching, but not glued-to-the-tv watching.",1237161600,,968,5.018867924528302
2888268,3,B000SMNL92,"Birds of Prey certainly has its moments.  The cast is very pretty, they've taken a few acting classes, and when they're given a script that doesn't leave its brain in the bathroom, they sell it.

The problem is, this last note becomes increasingly obvious as the show proceeds from its quality pilot episode.  Different teams of writers helm the show from one episode to the next, and they clearly 1) don't care enough about the material to make the best of it, or 2) were not given enough information about the characters to do the best with them they might have.  Any character consistency from one episode to the next has less to do with who the Birds are, and more to do with their physical appearances and the token childhood traumas they've all experienced, in itself a very weak attempt to breathe character melodrama into a darkly-lit show already suffering from too much crying and worrying.

That said, fans of the source material - DC's Batman comics and their associated Birds of Prey line - will initially find much to enjoy.  As thinly as these characters may be drawn in this format, they are on the whole true to the source material, and where not, it's consistent with the spirit of that material.  Two notable examples of this are Ian Abercombie's Alfred and Mia Sara's brilliant Harleen Quinzel/Harley Quinn.  These are not the characters we know and love from the comics, but as this show is supposed to take place some years after the world of those comics, they easily could be.  Some thought clearly went into Dina Meyer's Oracle/Batgirl/Barbara Gordon as well, as her performance probably stands alone as being the most faithful to the comic books.

In the final analysis, though, none of this is enough to make the show endearing in the sense of a cult classic, such as Joss Whedon's Firefly or the 1960s Adam West Batman.  Sooner than later, viewers get the impression that the production crew is trying very hard to appeal to them, but hasn't yet figured out how to do this, and isn't all that interesting in putting in more time to figure it out.  Granted, one could argue that 13 episodes is not a lot of time in which to get one's footing.  But Whedon managed so in the same space of time with Firefly, so it's rather unforgivable.

In the end, Birds of Prey is a brief, fun little romp through DC's rich fantasy universe.  But it lacks substance, and as fans of the WB/CW's Smallville would tell you, a DC property without substance is a DC property not really worth much consideration.  As Birds of Prey was also a WB/CW property, running around the same time as early Smallville, there's simply no excuse for the network to not have given this show more thought, except that they simply didn't care.  When that is so obvious, its hard for the viewer to really care, either.

And this is also a Batman-related property that fails to include Batman except peripherally.  The reason for this is clear: he would overshadow the Birds themselves.  But that's an indication that the WB/CW would have been better off making a quality live-action Batman show, instead of a Birds of Prey show they were not all that interested in making worthwhile.

Birds of Prey is a fun little series.  But really, that's precisely why it isn't much more than very pretty mediocrity.",1234828800,,3292,4.66897746967071

Citizens of Gotham City, you can now rejoice. The Bat and the Cat had a daughter and her name is Helena better known as the ""Huntress"" and she is prepared to single handedly take over where her father (Batman) left off. During the Joker's rein of terror on Gotham one of Batman's allies Batgirl was seriously wounded and now she must do her crime fighting from a wheelchair. Fortunately for Barbara Gordon (Batgirl) she has been able to reinvent herself as ""Oracle"", the team's cyber specialist. Black Canary (Dinah) is the inexperienced clairvoyant and the newest and youngest member ready and willing to fight crime in Gotham City.

The newest trio of crime fighters will live, fight and die together if they have to in an effort to rid Gotham City of its villains once and for all. Welcome to the ""Birds of Prey""

The ""Birds of Prey"" was a great series that showed a lot of promise in its early stages, but sadly the show was cancelled after only 13 episodes. Presented for the first time on DVD format all 13 episodes are here for your viewing enjoyment. Fans of the show will be upset to learn that the opening theme song has been changed as well as most of the music from the show. Fans may also be upset with the picture format, its not full screen or widescreen, its fake widescreen. Warner decided to present it in full screen then they added some black bars on the top and bottom to simulate a widescreen effect. Shame on you Warner for changing the music and not picking a picture format and sticking with it. This four single sided disc set is well done and contains a pristine looking video transfer and amazing sound. Just like the ""FLASH"" and ""M.A.N.T.I.S."" this show ended way to soon.

Personally I felt that like other shows, its cancellation had more to do with the television line up than the show itself. Saying that however, I cannot even express my dissapointment of the DVD's. Not only was the opening song changed, but the music for the entire season was changed. The final episode was the biggest dissapointment of all. The music added on the DVD's was totally not in sync with the choreography of the fighting sequence. It made it looked dumb, they should of just left the T.A.T.U. song. They even changed the camera angles for some scenes. It totally ruined the show for me. If they had aired the show like this on T.V. I would have stopped watching it after the first episode. I'm sorry to say that had I known that they had changed it like this I would have never bought the DVD's. They ruined a perfectly good show.",1228694400,4,912,4.434523809523809

The only thing that ruins this DVD presentation was that Aimee Allen did the original theme song ""Revolution"" and it is NOT included on this collection. i guess she didn't want to be part of the show or release the rights or whatever legal mumbo jumbo.

And small wonder, that.  While the show was fun and watchable, it was not at all the Birds I (or anybody else who's read the comic) wanted to see.  Comic fans were turned off by the lack of faithfulness to the source material, cheesy music (think Avril Lavigne and Maroon 5), and girls' bonding theme and anybody who would enjoy that angle would be turned off by the bad superhero costumes and sci-fi aspect.  Way to fail both prospective audiences, guys.  But I've come to (sort of) praise ""Birds"", not bury it.  The show did a lot of things right, it just needed a nerd's touch.

Each episode begins with a lame voiceover sequence by the Dark Knight's famed butler Alfred Pennyworth (who is great in this show) where he sums up the premise.  Helena Bertin...err Kyle (sorry about that) -aka Huntress- is the secret daughter of Batman and Catwoman.  It describes Catwoman as ""the queen of the criminal underworld"" which is cheesy at best and also downright wrong.  Catwoman was a mercenary thief who worked alone, not an organized criminal, but I digress.  Anyhow, during Batman's final confrontation with The Joker, the Clown Prince of Crime sent a lackey to stab a retired Selena Kyle/Catwoman to death (yeah, right) in front of a young Helena while he himself paid Batgirl (Barbara Gordon) a visit, leaving her permanently wheelchair bound.  How Joker knew who Batgirl or Catwoman even were is not explained.  During the flashbacks we are treated to a line of Joker dialogue delivered by Mark Hammil himself, whose greatest non-Star Wars role was voicing Mr. J in the immensely popular&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-Animated-Series/dp/B000B7QCHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman - The Animated Series</a>.  So Batman vanishes, Barbara Gordon -now a master hacker and general master of cyberspace- adopts Helena Kyle and the two fight crime together, then teenage psychic runaway Dinah Lance shows up and our synopsis is complete.

The show takes on a ""crime of the week"" format, usually revolving around what are referred to as ""metahumans"". These are people born with superpowers.  In the comic it doesn't come up often, but it's run into the ground here in an attempt to borrow themes from more popular comic heroes like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men/dp/B000HEVZ9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men</a>. In addition, we're introduced to the requisite police officer/love interest.  Because it's never good enough to focus on the main characters, you've always got to have a lame ""normal person"" to overreact to all of the crazy superhero stuff that happens.  Groan.  ""Birds of Prey"" seems to have been made with a literal checklist of genre cliches and standards firmly in hand.  The biggest disappointment of all is the (mis)handling of Dinah Lance -the tough-as-nails Black Canary in the comics.  Instead of a major bada$z martial-arts espionage agent with vocal cords capable of wiping out a tank with her Canary Cry, we get a lame angsty little teen with high school problems that can read thoughts with a touch.  BOOOOORRRRRING!!!!!!  Who on Earth approved this stuff?

Okay, hatey time is over for now.  Here's the good.  Ashley Scott is all sorts of hot and her attitude suits her character (Huntress/Helena) well.  It's not the Huntress from the comics, but there is very little room to complain regardless, even if she does crib most of her moves from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B00000K19E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>.  Dinah Meyer is a matronly-yet-sexy Barbara Gordon aka Oracle.  I miss the short temper and chip on her shoulder she sports in the comics, but again there isn't much to complain about.  This is another better-than-solid performance.  Rachel Skarsten: also gorgeous, also solid in her portrayal of impetuous teen Dinah in spite of the writers' awful handling of the character.  Mia Sara portrays a great ruthless sociopathic criminal mastermind. Too bad they opted to make that mastermind Joker sidekick Harley Quinn.  It just doesn't gel.  At all.  I understand the need for more Batman connections, but completely demolishing everything we know about another well-established character was way out of line.  A positively bubbly Lady Shiva drops by later to settle an old score which further irritates any connection to comic fans the show was trying to establish.  ""Birds"" begins to pick up steam after Dinah's mother, the original Black Canary shows up.  While this is closer to the character done right their portrayal of the Canary Cry is an epic fail.  The more you watch it, the more horrifically corny it looks.  But still, it rings in a less annoying Dinah and she slowly begins to resemble the character she should have been in the first place.  At the end of the day, the strong cast repairs a lot of the damage that the writing does to this show.

 One more season could have seen this show become something very cool, but it wasn't to be.  Nightwing as a non-lame love interest for Oracle?  Denied.  Dinah developing a less embarrassing Canary Cry than her mama?  Uh uh.  The return of The Joker or more of Gotham's classic rogues?  Not happening.  Less romance and high school garbage and more tail-kicking badness?  Sorry.  As off-putting as ""Birds of Prey"" was for comic fans, it built up some serious potential for possibly darker, cooler storylines in the future.  But new shows are not known for taking chances and it killed this one.  Why this was made as an extremely loose live-action adaptation when DC has had so much success with animated properties that stay true to the source material is beyond me.  Come on, DC's animation team; you have already given us flawless representations of Huntress and Black Canary in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League-Unlimited/dp/B000LE179S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League Unlimited</a>&nbsp;series along with Barbara Gordon as Batgirl in the Batman series.  It only takes one bullet to turn everyone's favorite crime-fighting librarian into The Oracle and there you have it.  PLEEEEEEEAAAASE!?!?

The special features forgo the usual snooze-worthy interviews and commentaries for a real treat.  ""Gotham Girls"" was an internet spin-off animated by some of the team behind the previously-mentioned Batman cartoon.  We get three seasons (about 30 minutes for each season) of amusing cartoon shorts starring the likes of Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Catwoman, and Batgirl along with some other familiar faces as you remember them.  The animation is cheap and so is the humor, but it is still a fantastic treat for fans of the old show.  Also included is the original BOP pilot which is an alternate version of the first episode.

""Birds of Prey"" is a series I'm pretty conflicted over, but it's worth a peak so long as you aren't allergic to cheese.  Hot girls kicking supervillain tail gets a pass with me most any day of the week and overlooking the baggage of being adapted from a much better comic, this show is very watchable if not outstanding and should have been given more room to grow.  Check it out and if you likey and even if you don't, have a look at the real&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Birds-of-Prey/dp/140120192X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Birds of Prey</a>&nbsp;and see just how cool this show should have been.

2888286,5,B000SMNL92,"Having read some of the earlier reviews, let me say I have the distinct advantage of not having been addicted to this show previously.  The unfortunate changes in music and editing did not affect me because I did not know any better (although I understand the complaints...being a fan of the Odd Couple & WKRP, I am aware of the ugly face of corporate greed).

Anyway, onto the show itself.  I love a twist on an old and overplayed story.  Just as The Dark Knight in the movies (and its prequel Batman Begins) were a fresh departure from the previously filmed Batman mythos, this show gives you a ""what if"" world to ponder.  Extremely addictive and sadly unique in its depiction of such strong and interesting female characters, Birds Of Prey gives you everything you want from this genre.

If you like complex storylines with solid acting, great action and even some sexual tension thrown in, you will like this show.  As with many a great show, it is sad that it was not given time to develop a following.  It is not unrealistic to say that over time this could have built the same following as Smallville or Charmed, 2 long running series.

We largely both happy.  The series is great, the story and action work well, and I'd love to see more of the actors in other things, especially Ashely Scott and Mia Sara.  But i do have two complaints.  One is bonus material.  Now, spread through the four discs is the entire (to my knowledge) Gotham Girls web series and the original pilot.  (Very similar to the one that was aired, but with a few changes.)  But that's it.  Nothing about the actors, the story, not even any commentary or interviews.  Then there's the music.  From what my wife tells me, they had some trouble deciding on a piece for the opening credits, and actually had three or four different ones before settling on Aimee Allen's ""Revolution.""  In this version, the opening piece is consistently one song that I don't recognize, despite the fact that Ms. Allen is credited with the song on nearly all, if not all, the episodes.  There was also the final fight song.  In the original version, when Huntress fights Harley Quinn you hear the t. A.T.u. Girls' ""Everything She Said,"" which is not only a great song, but really fit with the events of the episode.  Again, they changed the song, to something harder, and that just doesn't work as well.  Now, we're still glad we have the series, but we both would have liked to have heard the original music, and perhaps a few more extras.",1219968000,,1510,4.472527472527473

The show centers on ""Huntress"" who is Batmans daughter.  She is roaming ""New Gotham City"" while Oracle checks out the city for crimes.  Oracle alerts Huntress, who then proceeds to kick some bad guy butt.

This is a very light show, its fun, filled with action, and even provides some over dramatic cheese for fans of B movies.

Amazons low price makes this a no brainer.  For a little more than the price of a movie (which likely won't be good anyway) you can watch 13 episodes of crime fighting action.

I should note, I did not make the connection until I wrote the review for my website, but Huntress is played by Ashley Scott, the very cute girl from Jericho.  She looked familiar but I could not place her.  That is where you will know her from.  She is very fierce in this show, and defiantly worth checking out.

2888298,3,B000SMNL92,"Riding on the coattails of Smallville during its heyday, this was a show that was by far more ambitious.  Birds of Prey was--and still is--a great concept that is hard to do wrong, withstanding significant retooling from the source material (as was the case with this show).  Back when Birds of Prey first aired, the comic book series by Gail Simone and various artists was at a creative and commercial peak and the show could have drawn more from that success by translating elements that made the comic book successful (woman's POV inner monologues; well-structured plot arcs; cool action fighting).

What came out in the end was far from ideal; I liken BoP's translation from comics to screen to what happened with Garth Ennis' initial run on Marvel's Punisher when it was turned into the 2004 film. It just came out wrong.  The production value on Birds of Prey is jarringly uneven; the intro looks like a promo that was run for that Batman-themed Six Flags stunt show.  And there are times when the show looks the same as, if not worse than, all those syndicated sci-fi shows that are run late nights or weekend afternoons (i.e. Mutant X, Earth: Final Conflict).

That being said, there are more than a few shining moments for this show.  Most notable is the casting--this was a star-making role for Ashley Scott and both Dina Meyer and Mia Sara are inspired choices for their respective roles.  And Rachel Skarsten and Shemar Moore do a more than adequate job with their parts.  Ian Abercrombie is a fine actor, but his Alfred Pennyworth doesn't work for me at all.  The show itself is pretty well written, if you can divorce the writing from certain interpretations by production and some bits of guest casting (Clayface in this show was one of the dumbest things I've ever seen--no joke).

So if you can give this show a huge grain of salt, there's genuine enjoyment to be had.  If you want something in the vein of The Dark Knight, don't come anywhere near this show.",1217980800,2,1976,4.679190751445087

I was in the middle of writing a review the other day, and considering that I was going to write basicaly what I am writing now with only seeing the first two discs, I decided to hold of till I saw the whole series.  I just finished watching the last episode and I have to say......crap.  I almost never am this critical on anything (I even liked the first Hulk movie!) but this series was bad.  The actors didn't do a real bad job but the directing was horrible.  The scripting was cheesey (Like early on in the series two 'superheroes' were fighting and Oracle says something like ""HEY!!  No use of superpowers in here!!""

Did I say pandering?  Yes I did.  Girl power, girl angst, girl problem solving, relationship issues...every bit as nauseating as Charmed.

However, before you pounce and say I am anti-women's rights, think again. I find shows like this to be insulting to women, perpetuating a stereotype instead of moving forward and allowing people to just be people.

But then again, I'm not a twelve year old girl, so maybe I do not see the . . .charm . . . of this series.",1217116800,2,725,4.454545454545454
2888303,4,B000SMNL92,"First, let me say that I am a fan of all the comic incarnations of ""Birds of Prey"". In addition, I also admit to being a fan of the show. I enjoyed the attempt to ""meld"" the various ideas presented in the comics and create something different and new. I enjoyed Ian Abercrombie's portrayal of Alfred and I thought Dina Meyer as Barbara Gordon/Batgirl/Oracle was inspired, perfect casting. I always find it fascinating to see how ""book"" characters will translate into live action based on another person's vision or imagination. Sometimes I agree with that vision and sometimes I don't. Still, I enjoy the creative attempts just the same. Having said that, I am thrilled to finally have an official DVD release in spite of the perceived ""flaws"", including changes to some of the music.

Music rights are a complicated issue (having been employed in the DVD retail world as well as being a musician who records her own CDs, obtaining music rights in general is often a frustrating mass of legal red tape and futility). In most cases, it's not just the song rights that need to be considered, but the performance rights as well, and it can end up being an EXTREMELY expensive undertaking. While I am disappointed in some of the changes (especially the elimination of the original theme song), the music for me was always secondary to what was presented on screen, which brings me to the main purpose I submitted this review.

In reading some of the reviews, it is distressing to see just how much confusion exists with respect to the whole ""Fullscreen/Widescreen/aspect ratio"" issue. Here is a link that will hopefully alleviate that confusion:

""Widescreen.org: The Letterbox & Widescreen Advocacy Page"" ([...]

This website provides excellent and detailed explanations regarding the differences between the two formats. In addition, they supply an ""Aspect Ratio"" link that offers detailed information on each aspect ratio (1.33:1, 1.66:1, 1.85:1, 2.35:1, and so on). A link is also provided which allows visitors to view some specific examples of the differences. With regard to this specific release, I actually sat down and compared it to the personal VHS recordings I did when the show originally aired back in 2002. Yeah, I know, I have WAY too much time on my hands. I am truly pathetic! However, there was such an outcry before the set was even released that I needed to see for myself. I can honestly say that the WB DVD release matches my home recorded VHS copies exactly (except for the fact that the sound and picture on the DVD release is PRISTINE compared to what I recorded off the TV). No side footage is missing (which does occur if widescreen is converted to fullscreen--the side footage is cut to make the rectangular widescreen picture into a square fullscreen one. Anywhere from 15-40% of the original picture is lost by this method). This tells me that what was initially broadcast (into MY home anyway) was most likely a matte fullscreen which can mimic a widescreen-like quality. It definitely looks much ""cooler"" than straight fullscreen (which is 4:3 or 1.33:1).

Overall, I am happy with the set. I give the release 4 stars instead of 5 simply because I do think that WB could have put a little more effort and expense into the release. Still, who knows? If this set sells well enough perhaps WB will release an edition that brings the original cast together to provide commentary. I certainly wouldn't mind a retrospective ""Reunion/Making of..."" featurette or a gag reel. After all, how many times have we purchased a TV show or film on DVD only to see a bigger, better version released later on? I can dream!

Seriously, in closing, I do hope that the link I provided above helps to clear up any misconceptions and misinformation that people may have had about picture formats. And now, I'm off to see ""The Dark Knight"" with my husband!",1217030400,3,3862,4.826283987915408

Dina Meyer is absolute perfection as Barbara Gordon/Oracle--one of the very best casting choices in all of the Batman movies/shows.  Kudos also to Mia Sara.  Her Harley Quinn is a scheming mistress of evil, not the airhead comic relief of Batman:TAS.

The Birds of Prey is not just about fighting the bad guys. It about 3 very stong willed women who try to also find a normal life outside of crime fighting life style. Barbara dates a counsellor from New Gothom High named Wade, and she ends up falling in love with him. Despite the fact that she kepted on telling herself that it would not work out.

Dinah tries her best to fit into high school and get that cute boy that she likes to go to the dance with her. She ends up doing something that I'am sure all us ladies would love to do to our boyfriends read their minds to find out what they like.

 Helena is trying to find out who she is besides being the daughter of Catwoman and Batman. She also ends up falling in love with detective Reese. You'll see a lot of flirting going on between these two. If your looking for some kicking of bad guy butt and a little romance too check out disc 4 of the DVD set.

One more thing all of the ladies Helena, Barbara, and Dinah all try to take revenge on the people who killed their loved ones.

2888310,2,B000SMNL92,"A laughably bad lot of female lead characters introduces us to the world of New Gotham, where Batman has long since driven himself into exile, and new heroes must wage a war during the night. The 2002 TV show Birds of Prey features the further ideas of fighting crime in a city overrun with criminals, along with spinoffs of Batman's most famous accomplices and enemies. Terribly clich&eacute;d dialogue, poor special effects, superhuman abilities that defeat the power of Batman's admirable humanness, and second-rate acting all create a show that has befitting ideas and appalling execution.

Alfred (Ian Abercrombie) still faithfully watches over Batman's family, including the daughter he didn't know he had. After the death of Catwoman, who married Bruce Wayne, Batman has vanished, disenchanted with fighting evil when it continuously brings harm to his loved ones. The Joker (voiced by Mark Hamill) seriously wounds Batgirl (Dina Meyer), confining her to a wheelchair, causing her to take on the name Oracle and play the mastermind behind Gotham's vigilante defense. She takes in Helena Kyle (Ashley Scott), Batman's daughter, who takes up the role of a caped crusader known as The Huntress, and the two help to clean up the streets of the dangerous city.

Dinah Lance (Rachel Skarsten) has visions of Oracle and Huntress and knows that she must travel to New Gotham to find her destiny. She possesses Metahuman powers, like Huntress, which allows her to see events in the future (and eventually manipulate the mind) through physical contact. Although Helena is against it, Dinah joins the group to stop a devious plot machinated by Harleen Quinzel (Mia Sara). Together the trio takes on several new super villains and dozens of evildoers as they stand up for everything Batman established in vigilante justice.

Many elements are familiar, including the characters of The Joker, Alfred and Batgirl and locations such as Arkham Asylum. But in an attempt to make Gotham and its young female heroes hip, even more things are different. Birds of Prey goes against every major aspect Christopher Nolan has tried to define in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Nolan's vision places Batman in a world of serious rivals and deadly consequences, as well as realistic explanations for his crime fighting abilities. Instead of sticking to realism, Birds of Prey allows its characters to possess superhuman powers that transcend mere intelligence and high-tech weaponry. It is this startling X-Men mutation factor that is most disheartening to see in a Batman spinoff.

And of course the dialogue doesn't help to ground an already goofy premise with unbelievable superheroes. ""We're the good guys,"" explains Helena - so that the audience certainly won't forget. ""Why don't you carry any weapons?"" inquires detective Reese, a police officer intent on discovering the truths behind Oracle's team of elite crime fighters. ""I am the weapon,"" queries Huntress, as she eludes the detective with a quick cut to her catlike eyes and a ludicrous tiger roar sound effect accompaniment. Helena complains about due recognition from the public, yet doesn't wear a mask, and Dinah gets caught up in ridiculous dramas at school. Most often characters talk to themselves to inform the audience of the progression of the story, and nearly all of the dialogue is sadly humorous due to its poor timing or generic phrasing.

Whether the eye-candy trio squares off against Darkstrike, a mysterious water assassin, underground gladiator fighting rings, copes with New Gotham High School, or defends against the assassins of Harley Quinn, Birds of Prey doesn't feel like a Batman series, and certainly doesn't feel original. Often painfully bad dialogue, silly story arcs and dreadful acting round out each episode, which makes the Gotham Girls South Park-style web series special feature more enjoyable than the appropriately short Birds of Prey series.

2888315,4,B000SMNL92,"Okay, I just picked up the 'Birds of Prey' DVD set.
It looks and sounds fine, but here are a couple of things that you will probably want to prepare yourself for before buying it, so you won't be dissappointed.

1) Though it is in the original 'widescreen' aspect ratio, IT IS NOT enhanced for widescreen televisions (anamorphic widescreen).  What does this mean?  Well, if you have a standard TV, you will have a black border at the top and bottom of your screen.  If you have a 16:9 TV, you will have to blow the picture up to fit the screen (which means a lower picture quality) or else you will have a black border surrounding the entire picture.

note : Oddly enough, the 'Unaired Pilot' IS enhanced for 16:9 televisions. Hmmm....

2) A great deal of the music that was on the show at the time that it originally aired (including the original theme song by Aimee Allen) has been replaced for the DVD (most likely to keep down the cost of the licensing to include it in on the DVD).  (In the finale, the TATU song that played during the big action scene is most notably gone.)

note : Though the Michelle Branch song has been replaced at the end of the 'Unaired Pilot', it is still there at the end of the 'Aired Pilot'.

BUT...

I am glad that they released the set.  It looks better than my VHS-taped off of TV copied with all of the station logos blocking portions of the picture.  I do wish that the entire DVD was 16:9 enhanced.  And I do wish they would have been able to leave the great theme music during the titles.",1216166400,25,1528,4.300699300699301

So, you can all relax.

Hope this helps :)

P.S. The next reviewer seems to have some erroneous info about this release, and here was my comment to him:

""Anamorphic has nothing to do with the aspect ratio of widescreen, anamorphic simply means that the picture will properly fill up a widescreen TV without the picture appearing stretched (and since I don't have a widescreen TV, I can't report on the validity of this being anamorphic or not).

I've watched 9 episodes so far, and this is true widescreen and not letterboxed (as there's no crowded feeling in the frame or missing side information associated with simply putting black bars at the top and bottom of the picture to create a faux widescreen formate).""",1214870400,27,973,4.633720930232558
2888323,5,B000SMNL92,"I started watching this show on WB the very first day it aired -- the only TV show I can ever claim that with -- and as each episode passed, my enjoyment became obsession.

All three of the main characters are likeable, dynamic, and interesting.  The dialogue, while occasionally cheesy, is overall witty and clever and a great deal of fun.  I loved both the romances (especially Helena's :D), and greatly enjoyed all the other character interaction.

As far as villains go, Mia Sara's Harley Quinn has got to be one of the most fascinating villains I've ever seen.  She's so bizarrely and believably psychotic!  While I like all three main characters a lot, I can definitely say it's Harley Quinn that makes the difference between ""loving the series"" and ""obsessing over it.""

And as for plot, I won't reveal any spoilers, but I will say this: in only thirteen episodes, it managed more than three huge plot points that blew my mind.

When I first found out this series was going to be cancelled -- on Christmas day, of all days! -- I cried for hours.  Ever since then, I've been waiting to see it get released on DVD, and I'm psyched that it is now going to be.

2888328,3,B000SMNL92,"Despite the many liberties it took with DC mythology, Birds of Prey displayed a boat load of promise, but sadly got the axe before it had the chance to grow into something special.  The story revolves around Helena Kyle, AKA The Huntress (Jericho's Ashley Scott), who just so happens to be the daughter of Batman and Catwoman.  She joins forces with the wheelchair-bound former Batgirl Barbara Gordon (Dina Meyer), and the telepathic Dinah (Rachel Skarsten) to fight crime in Gotham City when Batman mysteriously disappears.  Other familiar faces from the Batman world appear also throughout the course of the series, including trusty butler Alfred (Ian Abercrombie), Harley Quinn (Mia Sara), and even the Joker (played by Roger Stoneburner with the voice of Batman: The Animated Series' own Mark Hamil!), but there were often times when the show just felt as if it wasn't sure of what it was.  Granted though, Birds of Prey never came off as cheesey and sugar-coated as Smallville, and by the time the series came to an end, things were just starting to really pick up.  Despite it's flaws though, Birds of Prey always managed to entertain.  Who knows what might have been, but the fact is Birds of Prey was never given the time and opportunity to grow, which is a crying shame.

Only one of the characters is the same as in the comics - Barbara Gordon.  The character of Helena Kyle/Huntress is based off of an alternate comic story line, not the standard DC version of Huntress/Helena Bertinelli.  I didn't find any problem with this switch.  My problem was with Dinah Redmond.  She is absolutely nothing like her DC universe (nearly) namesake, and the series is poorer for it.  If they wanted to have a younger cast member they have plenty of DC characters to choose from (I would suggest Cassandra Cain), or they could make one up from scratch, but don't change Dinah.
My other major problem with the series was the lame Batman and Joker fight scene (scenes?)  They could have actually done something with this, but instead decided to show the area around a fight while avoiding pointing the camera at the fight at all.  At least, that is how I recall it.

You know how people got so excited about the Transformers movie? That's how I was every Wednesday when the new Birds of Prey episode aired. The attitude, the action, everything was edge-of-your-seat amazing, even if, like those old Transformers cartoons, not everyone got into it. And I've never felt that way about any other TV series. I don't even own a TV these days, and yet this one caught my heart. I know I'm not alone in being ecstatic all over again now that it's FINALLY being released. Long live BoP! Can't wait to see Huntress' smirk again. Ashley, honey, you are the weapon!",1208563200,7,703,4.5
2888334,5,B000SMNL92,"This was another of many shows to be cancelled before it could develop a relationship eith the viewers and the cast. Why this happens is beyond me! It was a well casted and scripted show that deserved more air time (especially following the casts historys and future adventures)! Does anyone remember ""Space Rangers"" [about 10 years ago]? It looked good, but was pulled after only FOUR episodes! I've been waiting for this show to be released on dvd (as well as Witchblade,Queen of Swords[at a reasonable price],Brimstone,Good vs Evil/G vs E, etc.).This ones a real treat and is highly recommended!",1208563200,7,598,4.99

I'm really happy to be able to see these 13 episodes again.  Of course, if I had my way it would be in it's sixth season on tv right now with all my five seasons of DVDs at home!",1208217600,10,348,3.9285714285714284

2888337,2,B000SMNL92,"I saw this as it aired on TV.  I was looking forward to it from the second I heard it announced. Then I watched it. It was a train wreck. Instead of the smart hacker and spy show set in the Batman universe, we got this garbage Mutant X knockoff.

Too many cooks maybe? This show took too many things and tried to glue them together. They had Burton and Halle Berry's Catwoman mixing with an old 70s alternate Earth version of Catwoman and Huntress. They had Dinah as a Dead Zone teen runway instead of a member of the Justice League. Then there was the whole Batman leaving Gotham. Harley Quinn. New Gotham. So many mixed up things that didn't work and created a weak show.

I have to give Dina Meyer credit. Her Oracle was spot on. It's just everything around this one pillar of goodness was rubble.  For her role alone, that's one more star, but I still cannot recommend this failed series.

Go check out some of the book to see why I'm so disappointed here.

2888338,4,B000SMNL92,"I LOOOVED this show when it premiered on the WB. I even started collecting the comic book after the show premiered. Even though the show was completely different from the comic book I always LOVED the idea that Huntress was the daughter of Batman and Catwoman.
  The acting was fantastic. Ashley Scott played a great Huntress. What was kind of funny was that Ashley acted a hell of a lot like Batman and Catwoman. Dina Meyer played an awesome Oracle. My favorite episode is when Oracle tried to face off against Lady Shiva. The only character that I really don't remember because she wasn't really interesting was Dinah. She was the psychic. I personally think that they should've just brought in the original Black Canary.
  The best thing about this show that a lot of hard core Batman fans(like myself) will like is that we get to see other great Batman villans like Clayface, Lady Shiva, (a small glimpse) of the Joker (with the voice of Mark Hamil), and of course we get to see the first flesh and blood Harley Quinn who was just so deliciously evil.
  This show was phenomenal the WB should've given it another season. If they did we might have gotten to see Bruce Wayne and we could've learned more about Batman's romance with Catwoman and what made Catwoman decide not to tell Batman that she had a daughter, and maybe we might've seen some more great Batman villans. Well, at least we will always have the memories.",1207612800,15,1424,4.608695652173913

8206042,4,B000SMNL92,"The show is good, a good complement to other superhero shows (e.g. Smallville, Arrow, The Flash, etc) but has a 90s feel to it (not necessarily a bad thing; made me a little nostalgic). My only complaint, aside from the show being cancelled after such a short run, is that it's shot in a non-standard aspect ratio so it looks like a shrunken version of 16:9 widescreen (black bars on all sides rather than just top and bottom). I spent the first 15 minutes or so trying to figure out whether my player was working right.",1518825600,,520,4.427083333333333

I really miss this show, yes I got the bootleg copies, that someone recorded on a DVR, but then I bought the series when it came out.. The series was great, and is great, and is still relevant today, I took it out of the drawer and re-watched it, that is why you buy a series, so go back and binge watch these again.",1516233600,,482,4.03125

Its a campy yet action-driven superhero show with The Huntress as our hero and anti-hero simultaneously. Daughter of Batman and Catwoman?! Shes bound to have internal conflict.
I know there are many things about this that don't fit the comic books, many universes colliding. However, it was a pretty solid stand-alone program.
Unfortunately, it got cancelled very early on, and the ending kind of sucks.",1513382400,,490,4.845238095238095
