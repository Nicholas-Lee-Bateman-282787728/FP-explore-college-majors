5188743,3,B008XAT118,"Stephen Sommers knows how to make a dumb b-movie. His career has been full of them. His early movies were mainly family entertainment, but for his first R-rated feature he delivers a monster movie on a cruise ship that could have been spectacular, but isn't.

The story has boat-for-hire Captain Treat Williams (imagine Colin Farrell's dad) drive a bunch of mercenary goons out to a rendezvous with the Argonautica luxury ship in the South China Sea. The goons plan to loot the ship and sink it, but when they hop aboard they find it abandoned with all lifeboats intact. The presence of blood and undigested skeletons doesn't alert them to the fact that a hungry sea monster has taken over.

What disappoints the most about Deep Rising is that ALL of the creature and gore effects are in late-90s quality CGI. Why even hire Rob Bottin, known for his stunning effects on The Thing, RoboCop, and Total Recall, to create the monster if you're not even going to feature a single practical effects shot? The fact that Dreamquest Images and Industrial Light and Magic handled the CGI really surprises me as they are not that good, even by 1998 standards.

It is made watchable by a few decent kills, a macabre attitude, an above average Jerry Goldsmith score, and the presence of the beautiful Famke Janssen (who is full of yum, yum, yum). Though the dialogue is repetitive, some of the goons are woefully miscast (especially Jason Flemyng), and almost every scene takes place in 'flooded grey room with pipes'.

Deep Rising is enjoyable trash for a night of non-cerebral movie-watching and nothing more.

The Puppet Masters 3/5

Unfortunate enough to share a name with a brand of dirt-cheap Charles Band movies (but completely disconnected from them) I always figured that The Puppet Masters would be just as schlocky. It ain't art, but it is decent, low-brow, brainless entertainment.

A bunch of alien manta-rays land in Iowa in a confusing opening sequence. The authorities arrive and discover that the locals are slowly being turned into mindless slaves to their alien hosts. Sound like the X-Files? It very much does play out like a 3-part episode with virtually the exact same character dynamic and interaction. The tagline for the movie is even 'Trust no one'.

It also feels like a John Carpenter movie in some respects (the presence of Keith David, who really ought to be in every movie, only adds to this). And while it's a fairly non-epic movie it does feature some nice anamorphic Panavision photography and a bunch of character actors to keep you entertained in-between the silly plot developments.

As well as feeling the X-Files it also comes across as an Invasion of the Body Snatchers rip-off, odd since co-star Donald Sutherland was in one of those movies. Four years later another very similar film called The Faculty also featured mind-controlling alien parasites, as well as the Brain Slugs from Futurama. But apparently it's taken from a novel of the same name by Robert A. Heinlein but with little in common, perhaps thanks to a zillion re-writes.

These kinds of movies often have some kind of political subtext, but Puppet Masters embraces its low-brow but clever silliness and ends up a guilty pleasure.

Thank heavens for Mill Creek. I never ever thought that Deep Rising would see the light of day on Blu-ray. Even the long out-of-print DVD was non-anamorphic and a direct, cheap laserdisc transfer. The film was never a high-key, glossy-looking  blockbuster thanks to its dank atmosphere and perpetual night setting, but it looks very good in 2.35:1 1080p and sounds even better in DTS HD-MA. Disney would never have put this on Blu-ray but even if they did they probably would not have done as good a job as Mill Creek.

I consider The Puppet Masters to be an extra on this disc. It also looks and sounds good, but Deep Rising is the main attraction here.",1351468800,2,3880,4.834087481146304
5188744,5,B008XAT118,This is a great buy for the price.  Two under the radar movies that I never thought would be put on blu ray.  Both movies are decent and the video quality is very good considering its on one disc.  Recommended.,1351382400,,210,4.2
5188745,5,B008XAT118,"If you have never seen these two relatively obscure movies, you have missed quite a treat.  Both are outstanding.  And now they are together on Blu-ray for a song.  As science fiction goes, both are at the top of their game.  Actors are great, acting is great, story is great, and the monsters are great.  Don't bother looking at reviews and critiques.  If you enjoy sci-fi movies, buy the disk and see for yourself.  You will be glad you did.",1350432000,5,443,4.4625
5188746,5,B008XAT118,"Deep Rising (1998)

Watched the Deep Rising Blu-ray recently and it is a LARGE improvement on the previous non-anamorphic DVD. The picture quality I'd rate 7/10, the close-ups had a lot of detail. The movie is filled with dated CGI but I'm always willing to put that aside given the year of production. However, you will be hard pressed to find a more aggressive 5.1 soundtrack mix filled with gunfire, monster sounds, ship and hardware sounds - real ear candy and delivered in DTS-MA HD. Recommended.

The Puppet Masters (1994)

The Puppet Masters which for some reason I've never seen before, loosely based on a Robert Heinlein story. Decent 'B' movie starring Donald Sutherland. Many of the outdoor shots seemed flat and dull while the interior shots were solid with more clarity, it had the look of a made-for-TV movie. Special effects were convincing enough to make for an entertaining popcorn flick. The DTS-HD MA 2.0 sound was pretty good although I had Denon set up to use the surround channels and matrixed to 5.1.

Both movies are on a single disc with the correct aspect ratios 2.35:1. If you're a fan it's worth the upgrade and a bargain.",1350259200,27,1150,4.763819095477387
5188747,5,B008XAT118,"One of my favorite guilty pleasures,Deep Rising, finally comes to Blu-ray. Can't wait. It's a full tilt action ride. Purportedly about a Monstrous Squid rising from the deep, as usual, it's really about the characters populating the film. And what a cast we get in this one. As the captain of a small PT type ship, with a motto of, if the cash is there, we don't care, Treat Williams is fine in the hero (good guy?) role. The mercenary crew who have chartered the ship are led by Wes Studi, and a lovely crew they are. Painted in broad strokes as ultra-violent, ridiculously unredeemable bad boys. I particularly enjoyed Djimon Hounsou, he is always good, but if you haven't seen his performance in Blood Diamond, treat yourself. Their plan is to hijack and rob a luxury liner. But they find it dead in the water, without power, and seemingly empty. They do meet up with a few survivors. Among them the not so pure ship owner, Anthony Heald, and the lovely Famke Janssen, who's back and forth banter with Treat Williams is a workable chemistry. now let the blood and gore fly as Squidy takes the stage. Course the gore is done in the over the top style that renders it non-retch-able. Having to work together to get off the ship, they are of course going down one at a time. Some even get a poetic come-up-tance, Wes Studi's was fun. But with movies of this ilk, what can raise it beyond it's parts is a great side-kick, The Great Kevin J. O'Connor is at his scene stealing best in this one. I think he is given some of the best lines in the movie, and his delivery is always spot on. So if your looking for hi-brow entertainment, with a sensible plot, you didn't read this far, so no worries, But if your into all-out, non-stop mayhem, cartoonish characters, bullets, blood & gore, with dialog consisting mainly of one liners, this is for you. The Blu-ray of Deep Rising at $6.99 is worth it alone. Getting another movie (Puppet Masters) is like an extra prize in your Cracker Jacks.",1348617600,15,1984,4.498614958448753

5188760,5,B008XAT118,"I have to be honest, I bought this 2fer Blu-ray purely for DEEP RISING. I saw Puppet Masters on cable and while it was an okay variant of Invasion of The Body Snatchers, it didn't thrill me all that much. Thus, this review is for DEEP RISING only.

THE STORY: High tech mercenaries hire the services of a laconic sea captain who skippers a re-purposed PT boat, to deliver them & their deadly cargo to an isolated location some 800+ miles off the coast of southern China. Once there, the mercs plan to intercept & hijack an uber-luxury cruise ship, fleece its rich passengers and clean out the ship's safe. When they eventually arrive (after an unavoidable delay), everyone is shocked to discover the gigantic ship apparently empty, with no clues as to what happened ...except for several large pools of blood. And then it all hits the fan.

THOUGHTS: One of my very favorite guilty pleasure movies from recent years. Yes, it's cheesy. Yes, it's lame-brained. Yes, the F/X are terribly dated now. Guilty. Guilty & guilty. Even so, I just cannot get enough of this salty, snarky, sea monster disaster movie. The film has just enough of a tongue in cheek attitude to make it fun without slipping into self-parody. Treat Williams sets the tone and keeps things tense or light, as the situation demands. Sturdy Wes Studi makes for a very believable hardcore toy soldier, and he's got a gung-ho squad of stereotypical macho lunkheads to boss around & back him up, (including Jason Flemyng, Cliff Curtis, Clifton Powell, Djimon Hounsou and the late Trevor Goddard). Speaking of back-ups, Treat Williams, as PT captain John Finnegan, has scrappy 1st mate, Leila, (Una Damon), and a terrific Gilligan of his very own in Kevin O'Conner, as ship's mechanic & chief nitwit, Joey Pantucci. Rounding out the cast is a sexy, headstrong pre-XMEN Famke Janssen as Trillian St. James, a spunky thief forced to throw in with Finnegan and the ragtag commandos in the hopes of making it off the creepy creature-infested cruise ship in one piece.

The slimy sea serpent thingamajigs, courtesy of primo gross-out creature designer Rob (The Thing, 1982) Bottin, are really disgusting and cool. They are definitely NOT octopus mutants, as many reviewers have erroneously stated. The luxury ship owner Simon Canton (played delightfully by smarmy Anthony Heald) speculates that the creatures are an offshoot of the Archea Ottoia famliy. They more properly resemble mutant versions of bobbit worms (eunice aphroditois); see the GIF of one feeding. Regardless of whether they are somewhat factual or entirely fictional, they are undoubtedly huge, slimy, sneaky & savage. Action is kept at a pretty relentless pace except for the middle third, which is somewhat draggy. It's redeemed by an over the top, hair-raising finale. And let's not forget that last shot that just begged for a sequel which, regrettably, never happened. *SIGH*

THE BLU-RAY: This double feature from Mill Creek has both films encoded onto one single-sided disc. Compression doesn't seem to be much of an issue though the bitrate isn't as high as many other high-def releases. Still, there wasn't much in the way of artifacting, pixelation or edge enhancement that I could detect to plague either movie, thankfully. Both films look quite nice and the sound for each is strong, even and appears properly balanced between dialogue & sound effects/music. No bonus features for either of the films, which is a shame. I'd love to have heard a commentary on DEEP RISING from writer/director Stephen Sommers. DR is the only movie he's ever done that I've actually enjoyed completely. Again, such a shame that RISING never got a sequel. If you love either of these films you'll get a decent bargain on this barebones but solid Blu-ray 2fer release. Buy it for your favorite movie and consider the other flick a ""gimme"" that you can take or leave. If you like both then this is the combo you've been dreaming of. I unashamedly love the silly slimy sea-going shenanigans of DEEP RISING and give that film alone a full 5 STARS.",1448236800,2,4058,4.91970802919708

This is a comedy with a moderate dose of horror elements.  The ingredients for this goulash are as follows:  Big monster, big boat, funny dialog, great cast.  The actors excel at brining their quirky characters to life.  Williams and Janssen have good chemistry, while Kevin J. O'Connor embraces his role as Mr. One Liner.  The special effects are on the cheesy side and only add to the hilarity of the experience.  This movie is a lot of fun and one I revisit from time to time.

5188785,4,B008XAT118,"Stephen Sommers, known for his works The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, Van Helsing and the newly released Odd Thomas, shows off his directorial and writing debut with Deep Rising. When hundreds of people aboard a newly fashioned cruise ship vanish without a trace, a crew of military-trained mercenaries are 'taxied' by John Finnegan (Treat Williams) and his two person crew, where they will soon encounter a force unlike anything they've ever seen, rising from the depths below.

I hate people who call blatantly fun films ""popcorn flicks,"" but if you're one of these people, Deep Rising is truly the perfect popcorn movie. Filled with cheesy one-liners, decent visual effects (for the time period on a ridiculously small budget), over-the-top acting and thrilling action, Deep Rising doesn't insult your intelligence, but doesn't try to be an intelligent film; not in the least. I think Stephen Sommers is a brilliant director who knows exactly what he's doing, and i'm grateful for this. Every film he's done (including the somewhat poor G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra) have been fun and wild rides (Odd Thomas was and is his most serious and professional film to date, but is fun at times), and his films never feel like they're there to just make money.

The Puppet Masters is a sci-fi thriller directed by Stuart Orme and written by David S. Goyer, Terry Rossio & Ted Elliott, based on the Robert A. Heinlein's novel of the same name that depicts an alien invasion by slug-like creatures that use humans as hosts to do their bidding. Now i won't go into much detail on this film, other than that it's entertaining, but doesn't do the original story complete justice. The direction, visuals and production were fantastic, but the acting was decent and the script (which was chopped up by Disney execs) is laughable, throwing away the hard-core science fiction mixed with intelligible, fast-paced logic. Still, a good watch and decent compliment to Deep Rising.

For an asking price of a mere $5, this is beyond a steal; this is a genius, wonderful release that's worth every penny, and that's just for Deep Rising. The blu-ray has great sound, the picture is great but sometimes blurry in certain scenes, but still fantastic.

5188794,5,B008XAT118,"The Puppet Masters blows a considerable amount of weenie. The magnificent Donald Sutherland is totally wasted here, and appears totally wasted, floating through his scenes as if he just swallowed a handful of sweet 'ludes. Imagine Oddball from Kelly's Heroes becoming a high-ranking government official tasked with saving humanity and you'll get the idea. Eric Thal is billed as the star but his talent appears to be limited to standing around with his mouth hanging open. Wide open. It's disturbing on a number of different levels, the least of which is distracting you from the movie. Pass on this one, although there's a great drinking game to be enjoyed here. If you take a shot every time Thal appears with an unhinged jaw like a snake about to swallow an egg, you'll be out cold on the floor in thirty minutes.

Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about the rollicking trash masterpiece that is Deep Rising. There was a time when Treat Williams was on the verge of becoming a very big star in Hollywood, and as is so common in that town, it just never came together. Thus he became a familiar C and B list face in countless straight-to-video atrocities over the last few decades, until Stephen Sommers used him in this film (and he later did a great job in TVs Everwood). I like Treat. I've liked him ever since some jackass interviewing him called him out on all the crap films he's made and Williams replied with charming honesty (and I'll paraphrase to the best of my ability here), `I've done a lot of crap. But I've got a nice house.' All of which is a roundabout way of saying it's that kind of if-you-don't-like-it-go-f***-yourself charm that makes Williams shine here. Playing a character that could have been a paper cutout (a good guy involved in shady activities to pay the bills), Williams brings just enough cheek to make the character worth our time, and really fun (and there's a reason for the cocky Han Solo / Indiana Jones vibe in this character - the role was originally offered to Harrison Ford). In a story involving a bit of piracy action on a new cruise liner in the South China Sea and a nasty creature from the deep that derails the bad guys' plans, Williams has the support of a hilariously morose Kevin J. O'Connor (who can turn a peanut-eating scene into pure gold), Famke Janssen playing smart & cute & tough, and the underrated Anthony Heald in full-on slime mode. All of which makes this movie is a winner. Did I mention the half-dozen bad guys involved in the caper driving the plot are played by Wes Studi, Cliff Curtis, Jason Flemyng and Djimon Hounsou, to name a few? Top it off with some very good (for that era) CGI and plenty of horrific deaths and disgusting scenes and you'll see why this box-office bomb that`s a blast from the opening scene right to the very last line has gained such a strong cult following over the years.",1389312000,,2890,4.579150579150579

If you're like me, you really love the Mummy and thought it was action adventure goodness in a way they just don't make'em anymore.  And the Mummy Returns was a little CGI crazy.  Well, Deep Rising was a movie Stephen Sommers made before the Mummy and the movie benefits from him not having access to all that CGI budget.  He has to be very creative and use his effects sparsely which makes for an exciting monster movie.

A captain and his boat crew with a policy of not asking questions is hired to take a group of mercanaries to a remote spot in the ocean where a cruise ship is supposed to be waiting.  Some sort of heist is supposed to be going down, but when they arrive the passengers and crew are all missing and there's a lot of blood and destruction.  Turns out someone picked the wrong spot to park their cruise ship and something big has been unleashed.  There's tons of one liners and scares and thrills to keep you into the movie the whole way through.

Puppet Masters with Donald Sutherland is also alright, but it's a little more dated and feels like it's a rip-off of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (even though anyone who's seen the Faculty knows it the other way around.)  All in all, for the price this is a decent double feature to spend watching on a Saturday night with some popcorn and soda.",1363305600,,1414,4.383141762452107
5188811,1,B008XAT118,"This review is for the DEEP RISING PUPPET MASTERS combo blue-ray disc....

Just when you think you have the most awesome copy of
your favorite movie... something unexpected happens:

Now, get this,I LOVE,no totally, LOVE, the movie Deep Rising. I love it so much so, in fact, I watched it more than STAR WARS fans watch their movies.
I have it memorized, right down to the soundtrack and effects,
so of course, I want the BLUE RAY DTS soundtrack and enhanced video version.
So I bought the only BLUE RAY I could find...
But the disc I got was CUT. I don't know if I got a defective disc, or if they cut the movie to make it fit on the disc with The Puppet Masters, but
it cuts out the entire scene where: the camera zooms up to the cruise ship for the first time, sees a guy on the balcony, goes past him through the doors to a LOUD casino atmosphere with Asian dancers and a roulette game, female bartenders, and a Brian Setzer orchestra song BLASTING through the speakers. We pan over the entire cruise ship lobby and floors and see Hawaiian dancers and then Kodo drummers start playing until Mr. Canton stops them with a lift of his champagne glass and toasts to the Argonautica. ""Good Times Forever!"" Then Famke Jansen is introduced and
she's blowing bubblegum and walking past the Captain of the ship. She bumps him
and(in the American version) says pardon me in FRENCH and grabs a bottle of champagne. Then she goes out to the balcony we saw on the original fly in through the doors, and checks out the Captain's wallet she just stole from him. She comments on his picture and throws the wallet off the side of the ship. Then hears a weird sound from the creature although we don't know it's that yet.
This BLUE RAY SKIPS ALL THAT. And goes to Famke breaking into the safe on the ship.
NO introduction to the cruise ship, Mr. Canton, The Captain, or Famke. Can this really be a defective disc or did they do it on purpose to save disc space????
I am mortified. Horrified and totally depressed. It only cost 8$ with shipping, but
it is my favorite American movie of all time, so I hope its just my disc that is defective and the rest of you aren't getting ripped off and deprived of those awesome scenes and character development.",1363219200,3,2235,4.4092009685230025
5188812,5,B008XAT118,"Deep Rising is one of my favorite horror/monster movies.  Excellent cast and great acting.  This is one of those movies where you rapidly realize that the body count will be high.  Surviving becomes almost impossible against a relentless and nasty hoard of creatures.  The special effects are very good.  Some of the most dangerous and deadly creatures you'll ever see in a movie. Very realistic characters and they make the situation seem very real.  Great interplay between Treat Williams and Famke Janssen.  And villains of the human variety are there too.  Though the far more dangerous creatures create a shaky alliance between them.

I had an early copy of this movie that was not created for widescreen TVs.  It was a pleasure watching this fine copy.

The Puppet Masters is an excellent Body Snatchers type Sci-Fi movie.  Getting both of these movies for less than $10 AND in Blu-Ray is a true bargain.",1362700800,,910,4.875816993464053

Puppet Masters is Invasion of the Body Snatchers basically, but with some extra good work on the part of the actors in portraying symptoms of withdrawal, despondency and possibly even PTSD after the parasitic aliens are removed from them.

They hire a captain, played by Treat Williams, with a small fast torpedo style boat to get them out to the ship. Treat's crew includes a mechanic (Benny in The Mummy) and a co-pilot. Once they arrive they find that the chalenge isn't getting the money from any security force, it's staying out of the jaws of a creature. Of the two I enjoyed Deep Rising the most.

The comedy thrown in on this action/horror is definitely icing on the cake.  This Blu-ray version is pretty good.  Only two slight complatints I have are technical to the DVD disc itself.  On mine the disc icon shows up with the cover and title of the movie Van Gogh.  But it does actually have the two advertised movies Deep Rising/ The Puppet Masters on the disc.  My only other minor complaint is I had to open the player to get to the other movie after watching either one.  It wouldn't let me just go back to the menu where you see both titles in the beginning unless I ejected the disc and reloaded it.  Now considering the price, I'm not really complaining to much because the quality of the movies themselves is excellent and they both played without any problem.  I highly recommend purchasing this DVD.

Non stop action with a bit of humor thrown in, and a creature like you've never seen before, this movie has a little bit of everything for horror fans.  The Puppet Masters was much better than I thought it would be. Honestly, until I read the info on the movie, I thought this was one of the Puppet Master movies about killer puppets, but it's not part of that series at all.

5188829,4,B008XAT118,"Gotta love these combo packs that feature decent movies for a reasonable price.
Deep Rising is a 1998 monster flick.  Directed by Stephen Sommers, it's rated R for language, violence, and some gory special effects.  It stars Treat Williams, the unbelievably hot Famke Janssen, and Sommers staple Kevin J. O'Conner.  Brief synopsis is that Treat and Kevin have been hired to deliver mercenaries to a new luxury cruise ship filled with rich people.  When they get to where the ship is, something else has already gotten aboard.  I like a good monster movie and this is GREAT monster movie.  The confines of the ship lend a nicely claustrophobic atmosphere to the movie and crank up the fear factor.  The monsters themselves are some of the more original ones I've seen in 30+ years of movie viewing.  The action sequences are very well done and tightly choreographed.  The script is well done and the dialogue is snappy.  By itself this movie easily earns 4 stars.
The Puppet Masters is a 1994 alien invasion movie.  Aliens invade Earth and take over everyone they come into contact with.  The movie stars Donald Sutherland, Eric Thal, Julie Warner, Keith David, Will Patton, and Richard Belzer among others.  All turn in decent performances.  The overall story is fairly entertaining if not terribly imaginative: Aliens invade, mankind's fate lies in the hands of a select few, conflict, resolution, etc.  One thing to note is that while the movie claims to be based on Robert A. Heinlein's The Puppet Masters, only the names of the characters have been kept and the barest bones of the story have been kept.  Heinlein purists who are looking for a faithful adaptation of his work will need to look elsewhere.  Overall, I'd rate this movie by itself a solid three stars.",1357516800,,1769,4.843333333333334
5188830,3,B008XAT118,"I knew the director Stephen Sommers via Deep Rising, thus considered he's a director producing good film with limited budget.
Also, for the less than 5 dollar disc, the other thriller The Puppet Masters really make me feel 'unrelenting suspense and nonstop action'",1357516800,,264,5.162790697674419
5188831,4,B008XAT118,"Mill Creek's double-feature BD pairing of Stephen Sommers' 1998 creature feature DEEP RISING with the 1994 adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's influential sci-fi novel THE PUPPET MASTERS is well worth a look for genre fans.

Admittedly, I've never thought much of ""Deep Rising"", a Hollywood Pictures production that cost a relatively pricey $45 million back in the late `90s and bombed upon its release in the dumping grounds of winter 1998. Sommers' profoundly stupid film finds wisecracking hero Treat Williams leading a team of mercenaries (including Wes Studi in a rare ""non-ethnic"" role) to a cruise ship that's been decimated by an aquatic creature that's risen from the depths. Sommers' penchant for mixing lighthearted characterizations with large-scale effects sequences doesn't really gel in ""Deep Rising,"" mainly because of the cheap, threadbare production design that resembles an episode of ""SeaQuest DSV."" After an unmanageably talky first half hour, Sommers' film settles into an almost endless succession of characters being chased down tight corridors by a large squid-like creature - which, despite having been ""designed"" by Rob Bottin, is entirely animated. This being a 1998 release, the pedestrian CGI - which wasn't top of the line to begin with - really dates the film badly, as the cast (which also includes a sultry Famke Janssen and Sommers' horribly unfunny comic relief man, Kevin J. O'Connor) strains to look horrified by effects that are almost completely less than special.

Jerry Goldsmith's hard-working score has its moments, but it lacks the overall effectiveness of another, similarly themed genre film the composer scored nearly a decade prior: ""Leviathan,"" which at least inspired Goldsmith to pen a terrific, melodic end titles piece. His ""Deep Rising"" score has as much energy, but little in the way of memorable thematic material.

Robert A. Heinlein's ""The Puppet Masters"" was one of the most influential sci-fi novels of all-time, having set the stage for countless imitators and rip-offs - both in print and on the big screen - for years to come. Unfortunately, by the time Hollywood Pictures produced the first-ever motion picture rendition of Heinlein's material decades after its publication, countless films had already covered similar terrain, particularly ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""Invaders From Mars"" among others.

The resulting ""Puppet Masters"" movie - which, like ""Deep Rising,"" was DOA in theaters upon its release in the fall of `94 - is a curiously watchable yet highly flawed film that's indifferently acted and occasionally quite funny on an unintentional level. The screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (who would later write all of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films for Disney) and future Christopher Nolan collaborator David S. Goyer might have read better on paper, yet the film's execution is stilted and ""off"" - way, way off! Donald Sutherland stars as a ""Men in Black""-type government agent investigating an extraterrestrial invasion that finds bat-shaped alien creatures binding themselves to the necks of human victims, thereby taking over their minds. Limp supporting work from Eric Thal and Julie Warner (completely unconvincing as a fellow investigator) is partially off-set by veteran character actors (Will Patton, Yaphet Kotto, Keith David and Richard Belzer) with a better grasp of what they're doing, but even Sutherland himself seems out of it in a role that's a far cry from his turn in Philip Kaufman's ""Body Snatchers.""

Director Stuart Orme - whose career is mostly comprised of British TV credits - brings an overly placid, almost PBS-like approach to material that ought to crackle with suspense and horror. Instead, the movie's stone-faced, serious demeanor ends up becoming a near parody of itself - something that's accentuated by Colin Towns' earnest but likewise portentous dramatic score, which tends to punctuate some of the movie's more unintentionally hilarious moments (the entire opening where Warner tries to prove that there's something wrong because men aren't checking her out is worth the price of admission by itself). Still, the movie is far from a total loss: between its infrequent moments of comedy and the old-school (very old) special effects of the aliens flying about, ""The Puppet Masters"" proves to be watchable, old-fashioned sci-fi played so earnestly that fans of Golden Age fare are likely to be entertained by it, provided they can get into the right mindset. It's no ""Lifeforce"" but, then again, what is?

Mill Creek's Blu-Ray offers 1080p transfers that prove to be adequate on ""Deep Rising"" (which never saw an anamorphic DVD release here stateside) and superior on ""The Puppet Masters."" Both films were shot in 2.35 and benefit from the widescreen presentation seen here, even if both masters look as if they may have been struck some time ago. The DTS MA 5.1 audio on ""Deep Rising"" is quite effective in places, certainly more so than the standard 2-channel DTS MA mix on ""The Puppet Masters."" A trailer for ""Deep Rising,"" announcing a 1997 release date (the film was pushed back into a low-profile February `98 date), is the sole extra.",1356825600,4,5176,5.245169082125604

The picture was better than my VHS copy, but Stephen Sommers did NOT pull a Coppola on this title and restore it frame by frame.  Puppet Masters has the go-to DTS 2-channel that appears to be available to Mill Creek in some sort of bulk discount for MANY MANY titles they're releasing from the old Hollywood Pictures company.  The picture is very nice, better than Deep Rising, and as I watch it I often wonder what would have become of this movie if someone of importance had directed it to look like something other than Sunday afternoon matinee on TV, because the acting is there for a movie of this caliber, it's just visually static and sometimes boring to LOOK at, but still fun to watch.  I don't know how you could be upset and give this package a bad review really.  If you know the movies, this is an above-average pairing compared to some of the other recent releases where, for me, I'm buying them for ONE of the movies and the price is still worth it.",1356566400,,1206,4.504587155963303

5188841,4,B008XAT118,"I am a fan of Deep Rising from way back! It is just silly enough for it to be a fun romp and it is creepy enough to be taken seriously. The special effects are quite good and the Blu-ray version just makes everything clearer and more fun to watch.

I had never seen The Puppet Masters previously. It is a mixed bag. Some parts are exciting, but it kind of falls flat as the movie progresses. The script dialog is just plain stupid in parts. The creepiness comes more from the acting than special effects and even then it can be pretty dumb. They know a person has been taken over by an alien if the men don't stare at the lead actresses bust! The film came off as if it was done on a low budget and it really fives that feeling. An interesting note on this film is that two big elements reminded me of a couple of Jon Pertwee erta Doctor Who stories. The creatures hanging onto peoples backs and taking thenm over was very Planet of Siders and The Claws of Axos looks like it was taped when creating the hive that the aliens were building.

Both films look great on Blu-ray!",1354924800,,1074,4.183574879227053

5188843,5,B008XAT118,"I would encourage anyone to upgrade their older VHS or DVD movies to at least Bluray 2D quality (3D for those who have 3D grade TVs) as the quality of the picture is 100% better then VHS tapes and nearly 50% better then DVD's. The sound quality has been improved and upgraded as well. Most Blu-rays have many more features that can be viewed as well which make for a much fuller movie experience too! Oh and just so you know, even if you don't own a Bluray movie you should go buy an on sale Bluray player. Why? Because a Bluray player scans the disk many more times than just a standard DVD player, that it will even make your older DVD movies look much better. That is, as long as you have a flat screen type of TV that was purchased in the last five years. Good luck and go get some!",1354752000,,786,4.1103896103896105

5188848,4,B008XAT118,"Fans of either film, will appreciate that Deep Rising (1997) and The Puppet Masters (1994) are available on Bluray, although the Mill Creek Entertainment release is a no frills budget type offering, with two features on one disc.  Image quality is very good, particularly for The Puppet Masters.  Unfortunately, neither film is subtitled, and there are no bonus features whatsoever.  When the disc's main menu loads, you simply pick one film or the other.  Once in the either film, if you can access the pop-up menu, you can select subtitles, language, or chapters.

Deep Rising (4.5 stars)
Written and directed by Stephen Sommers, the creature feature Deep Rising is a really fun B-movie adventure set on the high seas, where a band of criminals seeking to rob a luxury liner, find a nearly deserted ship, instead of one teeming with wealthy passengers.  The heavily armed thieves prowl through the ship, and eventually encounter a strange carnivorous creature from the depths.

Heading the cast is Treat Williams, as the captain of a boat hired to transport the gang to the ship.  Quirky Kevin J. O'Connor (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mummy/dp/B00000JQB5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mummy</a>) is a member of his crew, and the lovely Famke Janssen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GoldenEye/dp/B00000K0E5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GoldenEye</a>) plays a pickpocket caught up in the crisis.  Wes Studi is very cool, as the leader of the bandits.

Produced when CGI effects were becoming more prominent in film, Deep Rising features a monster that is entirely CG, something rather progressive at the time.  While the special effects may not blow anyone away today, they hold up pretty damn well, and the Bluray is a good, but not great improvement, over the DVD edition, released over a decade ago.  Sommers continued working in the genre, going on to do the Mummy franchise, and the Scorpion King films.

The Puppet Masters (3.5 stars)
Loosely based on Robert Heinlein's novel, this big budget affair features the planet invaded by sluglike aliens, who attach themselves to humans, send probes into the brain, and take control.  The film moves quickly, as the action follows a team of government agents led by Donald Sutherland (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kelly-s-Heroes/dp/B003ASLJPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kelly's Heroes</a>) and Eric Thal.  Things are edgy for a while, but when the aliens begin to colonize, and romance blossoms, melodrama starts to dilute the science fiction.

Plagued with numerous issues regarding the final screenplay, The Puppet Masters does drift in the second half, but the level of action remains fairly high throughout, as most of the primary characters, are eventually taken over by the alien at some point.  Julie Warner (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doc-Hollywood/dp/6305133468/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doc Hollywood</a>) and Keith David (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thing/dp/B001CW7ZWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thing</a>) give good performances, and the presentation looks really sharp and crisp, in high definition.

While not a perfect match, this double feature makes a pretty decent pairing.  If you like one film, there's a good chance that you will find something to like about the other.  Each movie looks better on Bluray, and given the low price, is probably worth a double dip, if you already have either film on DVD, although the lack of any extras beside a trailer, is a real disappointment.",1352505600,,3668,5.9504761904761905
