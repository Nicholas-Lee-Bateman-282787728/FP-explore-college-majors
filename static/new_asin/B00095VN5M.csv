In THEO AND THE OLDER WOMAN**,Theo(Malcolm Jamal Warner) develops a crush on one of his sister Denise's(Lisa Bonet) high school classmates who is writing a story about typical family life for a class assignment. In CLIFF IN LOVE**,Cliff isn't exactly in love,but his oldest college student daughter Sondra(Sabrina LeBeauf) was. She had broken up with her boyfriend Elvin Tibidaux(Geoffrey Owens in his inaugural episode,but recurring) after he repeatedly stood her up. Sondra goes to a concert with a guy named Daryl Marchamp(guest appearance by Joseph C. Phillips who joined the cast as a regular in summer 1989). This was Phillips' first episode also. By the end of this episode,Sondra and Elvin had reconciled. In FOOD FOR THOUGHT***,Cliff,flabbergasted by a longtime friend with a high cholesterol level,changes his eating habits reluctantly so he doesn't develop that same problem. Clair feeds him 35- calorie rice cakes in their bed. The other episodes are great.",1165449600,,1541,5.589743589743589
