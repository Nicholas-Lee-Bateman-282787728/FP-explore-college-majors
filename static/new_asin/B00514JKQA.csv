4519434,5,B00514JKQA,"I purchased the third season of fairly odd parents. I forgot how hilarious this season was. This particular episode is wonderful because the cartoonist get to create a silent episode in pipe down.

4519458,5,B00514JKQA,"While The Fairly Oddparents is obviously a cartoon for kids, there are more than enough subtle jokes for adults to be amused. I have a 15 year old son who grew up with the show and while he's moved on to more age related interests, I can't help myself keeping up with the exploits of Timmy, Wanda, and my personal favorite, COSMO!!!! With the additions to Poof, Cosmo and Wanda's adorable baby and Sparky the dimwitted, but loveable magic dog, the show is fresher than ever and I look forward to many years of wacky and zany adventures to come. But I can't help wondering where Poof is on some of the new episodes.",1424390400,,614,4.394736842105263

4519488,5,B00514JKQA,"I bought this episode of the Fairly Oddparents because it included ""Shiny Teeth"" in which teen singing sensation Chip Skylark's teeth are stolen on the eve of his shooting the video for his song about his perfect teeth - It's up to Timmy and his fairies to get them back and then the video shoot goes on as planned - ""Shiny Teeth"" is one of my favorite cartoon songs, funny AND catchy - The second cartoon is also adorable when Timmy and his friends must try to save ""Wild West Town"" from developers - I really enjoyed them both",1393200000,,528,4.343434343434343
