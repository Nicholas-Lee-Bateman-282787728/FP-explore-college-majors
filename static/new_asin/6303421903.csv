Anyone who read the book must have been acutely aware of the great film  potential and I can imagine that Robert Harris must be kicking himself  because he allowed this version ever to be made - SO much more could have  been done with this story, if for instance they stuck to the original plot.  The story was grossly over-simplified for public consumption and the result  is a film that fails to create even the least interest, no small feat given  the exciting premise.",951091200,5,617,4.5636363636363635
652996,4,6303421903,"What if the Nazis had won World War II in Europe? Most of Europe is now Germania, Winston Churchill died in disgrace and in exile, the Russians continue the war in the East, and there is a Cold War with the United  States. Germania is preparing to celebrate Hitler's 75th birthday, with a  visit from U.S. President Joseph Kennedy. SS Police Officer played by  Rutger Hauer is investigating recent murders of one-time top officials,  even as one of these remaining officials seeks to contact an American  journalist, attempting to blow the lid off the long-concealed Holocaust.  Most people believe that the Jews were merely relocated. The movie was  startlingly plausible, but the ending, to me, sorely lacked substantial  resolution. It was as if it just sort of ran out of steam. Perhaps a larger  budget could have made for a more dramatic ending. Nonetheless, I give it a  high rating for being an otherwise excellent ""what-if-history""  type of movie, a concept which I generally enjoy, and which is not often  presented. In the same genre, I also recommend ""The Final  Countdown"", which postulates what might happen if a modern-day  aircraft carrier suddenly found itself near Pearl Harbor -- on December 6,  1941...",950918400,4,1222,4.98019801980198

652998,4,6303421903,"This is a very chilling and vivid tale of the world in an alternate historical path; What if Hitler had been the victorious hero and lived to see his vision of the Third Reich come to fruition for the rest of Europe  and possibly the world ! With this in mind, Fatherland is a true suspense  thriller with awesome actors and a believable 60's set design and  nostalgic, yet somewhat futuristic wardrobe ( although the film's events  take place in an alternate past). Rutger Hauer is one of today's most  underappreciated actors and Miranda Richardson is very convincing as an  American journalist. The most disturbing role of all is played by Jean  Marsh as an extremely bitter Nazi actress; Listen to a very chiling line  about the ""resettling"" of the Jews. This one particular line is  very shocking and haunting ! It serves as the underlying basis for the plot  in this film.",949449600,10,878,4.6797385620915035
652999,4,6303421903,"I guess the reason this movie was so confusing to me is because it has such a complex plot that it's impossible to absorb everything by watching it only once. Yes, the question 'What if Hitler had won World War II?' is  an interesting one indeed. But all the things surrounding that tends to  become a big puddle of confusion. Several things are happening all at once  in a movie and it gets quite deep. There was very good costuming, and an  excellent cast. I'm a Miranda Richardson fan so I think her portrayal of  Charlie was fabulous. How does so manage to always do that? She never fails  to make me gasp in awe at her acting talents. Great job Mandy!  I have the  movie and I plan to watch it again very soon and make sense of it all. I  recommend it only to those with long attention spans and those who can  figure out plots easily.

653117,1,6303421903,"I bought this on Amazon and was duped again by bogus reviews. The picture quality is poor because in order to save ten-cents' worth of tape, it was recorded at LP instead of SP. The first two minutes explains how Germany won the war and shows Germania.  From here it's all downhill. Many very neat SS uniforms and Rutger Hauer constantly walking through offices while carrying his full briefcase; we never get to know what's inside. There is a foreboding of an ominous occurrence which ludicrously turns out to be the discovery of the Holocaust. The year has to be 1964, since Hitler is 75. We are supposed to believe that the Holocaust was kept a secret until then, and that U.S. President Joe Kennedy was ignorant of it, and is convinced of it by a few pictures. Incomprehensibly and with no explanation, we are told that the Third Reich collapsed because the U.S, withdrew its support.

There is an abundance of Mercedes Heckflosse (tailfins) models, which were made in 1966. President Joe Kennedy seems to be riding in a 1959 Cadillac, which is at least not an anachronism. Hitler is riding in a Rolls-Royce, which he would never do, since loved Mercedes-Benz.

The hurried unveiling of the plot in the last few minutes elicited groans especially when the hackneyed device of the Nazi son betraying his father is iterated; his mother is never shown. Perhaps the budget could not be stretched to include another actress. The denouement is so rapid that I got the impression that the producers feared that the tape was running out. I would prefer a tour of the architecture of Hitler's Germania as constructed by Albert Speer recorded at Standard Speed to this banal, trite, non-credible fiasco.",1378252800,4,1697,4.804794520547945

653119,5,6303421903,"The first person to review this film got many of the facts wrong, but the other reviewers were fairly accurate on the story line.  What was so very interesting was how the ""propaganda ministry"" in ""Germania"" could take film footage and twist it to whatever interpretation they wanted.  Having visited Cold War Berlin, I found that the sets were fairly accurate.  The designers went into lavish detail to make sure everything in the background was as it would have been had Hitler and the Nazis won the war.

The Stasi (Staatsicherheitspolizei) in the film was far from laid back and the boy that played Rutger Hauer's son was absolutely perfect in showing the brainwashing that really was done during the communist era.  The boy's behavior, although so unexpected to anyone in modern day US, was quite predictable and normal for that type of society.  The SS was gone, but the East German Stasi was equally bad and the Junge Pioniere for children specialized in brainwashing young minds.  Having wandered around parts of East Berlin and East Germany, I saw the false fronts on buildings and stores, the empty shelves, the many propaganda posters, and heard the many tales of the indoctrination of the communist agenda into young children who were taught to spy on their parents and neighbors and to report any ""undesireables"".  This movie gets it all down to perfection.  The realizations of Albert Speer's designs for the ""New Berlin"" were brilliant.  It is a great ""what if?"" film (and book) just as good any day as ""The Boys in Brazil"" and ""Passenger to Frankfurt"".  I check regularly to see if the slow poke producers in Hollywood finally have decided to release this on dvd.  Have been sadly disappointed so far.",1362528000,3,1717,4.842465753424658

653122,5,6303421903,"""Fatherland"" is a brilliant ""alternate history"" story that features a bravo performance by Rutger Hauer.  The scenario is simple: the Allied landings at Normandy failed, and Germany comes to dominate Europe in a superstate known as ""Germania.""  The US was triumphant over Japan, America is the other world superpower, in a Cold War with Germania.  The story is set in 1960s Germania.

This is essentially a fascinating detective story.  Old-line retired Nazi leaders are being murdered just as US President Joseph P. Kennedy is about to visit Germania on Hitler's 75th birthday.  The Kennedy visit is seen as the end of the Cold War and the start of ""Detente.""  Is there a connection?  No spoilers here, but the ending has punch.

This is a wonderful film, featuring superb acting, a riveting story, and a wistful, melancholy setting that is hard to describe.  The superb musical score by Gary Chang tremendously adds to the atmospherics of this film.  The frightening thing about this story is its plausibility.  Had Hitler not been incompetent as a war leader, this alternate history might indeed be the world we are living in.

Why, oh why, is this film not available on DVD?  I believe that it would be snapped up by many discerning movie aficionados.  RJB.",1319846400,7,1261,4.909952606635071

653208,3,6303421903,"D-day had failed. Kennedy is president, Joseph sr. that is, not John. Hitler is about to celebrate his 75th birthday. That was all the exposition I needed. It's springtime for Hitler in Germainia. We lost. It is the early 60's & the cold war has taken a hard left turn from what we know happen. The Germans are still fighting the Russians. Hitler wants a peace treaty with The United States. It is about to happen. President Kennedy is coming to Berlin & bringing a lot of reporters. One problem: the Final Solution, what we now know as the Holocaust has never been made public. Any living officials with first hand knowledge are being bumped off. One of these murders becomes public & has to appear to be investigated. SS officer March  (Rutger Hauer) is the police detective assigned to sweep it all under the rug. He is a sympathetic Nazi with a conscience & a throughly brain-washed young son. At this point, the SS become the good guys & the Gestapo, as usual the criminals, covering up. An American reporter, Charlie (Miranda Richardson) gets wind of what she sees as the story of her career. Nuff said. The tone & mood of this movie is how victorious, post war, Nazi Germany might have been. A repressive facist regime to be sure but also a bit mellowed.

653209,4,6303421903,"I thought this movie was excellent. The story was really interesting and kind of a ""What If"" movie as in ""What if Germany had won WWII"". Rutger Hauer is excellent as the lead character and SS police officer who is investigating a murder in Germania the country that exist now that Germany has defeated Europe in WWII. Joe Kennedy is the president of the United States and their is going to be a summit to end this ""cold war"". Eager to make peace with the U.S. because of the horrible on going war in on the Russian front, Germany is trying to tie up some embarassing loose ends involving the unkown Holocaust that has been going on against the Jews.

This movie is just an intriquing and clever story with fine acting especially by Rutger Hauer who has only been better in Blade Runner but this is on par with that.",1139184000,,815,4.397350993377484

653211,5,6303421903,"I'm really wondering if the 1st reviewer actually saw the movie, since he got so many of the movie ""pre-history"" setting facts wrong.

The time is 1964, and a new US President (Joseph Kennedy Sr.) has just been elected.  It was HIS voice, among others, that convinced the US to withdraw from Europe after the disasterous failure of the Normandy invasion. The US then concentrated on beating the Japanese, while a humiliated Eisenhower sunk into obscure retirement, and Churchill died in exile in Canada.

Germany has conquered all of Europe, including Britain, and Europe west of the Russian-Polish border is at peace. But the war still rages on against the Soviets, still led by the aging Stalin.

Hitler desperately needs to sign a peace treaty with the United States, to get help to beat the Russians once and for all, and invites Kennedy to Berlin for Hitler's 75th birthday gala.

Meanwile, old-guard Nazi Party ex-leaders are quietly being murdered....

The plot - and this is essentially a mercilessly taut detective story - revolves around the efforts of SS policeman Rutger Hauer (who is just a ""cop"" and NOT the leader of the SS) and an American newspaperwoman to uncover just who is killing the old leaders... and why.

Well acted and plotted, this thoughtful and thought-provoking movie has a climax and an ending that are both emotional and ""right.""  Rutger Hauer is perfect as the SS policeman, and the movie showcases acting talents that I did not realize that he had!",1136505600,4,1483,4.8804780876494025

Churchill sent in excile to Canada, King Edward en Queen Wallis, Speer's realised buildings in the Reich. The makers used authentical images to create this alternative history and they succeed: it was very convincing.

For the first 30 minutes, the story was allright. The pictures of Nazi-Berlin in the sixties were impressing. But then everything went wrong. There was nothing left of the subtile and tragic plot of the book. I hardly believed my eyes and wondered what Robert Harris himself would think about the rape of his story. What drove the scenariowriters to turn an brilliant story in XXXX like this...?",1124755200,3,725,5.092436974789916
653283,3,6303421903,"I still hope that some of these obsecure movies will make it out to DVD. While not up to an academy award level, the premesis is certainly thoughtful. The time is the early 1960's. The place is Nazi Germany (Germania which is basically all of occupied Europe). The US only went to war against Japan after December 7 and Germany never declared war on the US. As a result, we won the war in the Pacific while Germany won the war in Eurpoe. The American president is Joseph Kennedy. Both the US and Germany have nuclear weapons in a different spin of the cold war.

We used ours on Japan ending that war and Germany used theirs on England ending that war. Germany is hiding a past the rest of the world is ignorant about (i.e. the Holocaust). It is anxious to break the stalemate with the US and open relations. While Germany is still a police state, thing are more relaxed now with the SS, led by Rutger Hauer, acting more like conventional police.

He is investigating a series of murders in Germany which are leading him back to a history he rather not know about. Suffice it to say, the plot thinkens with new twists and turns and is never resolved until the end of the movie when the American president discovers a well hidden secret just before he is to meet with an aged Hitler.

This is worth seeing if nothing else, just renting once. Rutger Hauer fans will especially enjoy seeing him in true form as someone who is devoted to duty, up to the point where it endangers his own family. Despite the one dimentional roles he is usually given, this movie, alike Blade Runner, allows him more depth and inner conflict of his character.",1123804800,,1636,4.446666666666666

comparisons from me on that point.

I first started watching this movie on HBO back

in the early 90's, but was interupted by visiting

friends and never got back to it. But the first

half hour of what I did see stayed with me enough

to want to search for this movie several years

later.

Viola... Amazon comes through AGAIN!

The movie starts out with some news reel footage

and a voice over explanation of the events that

follow the repulsion of the Allied invasion of

Normandy (remember: this IS a ""what if"" movie) that

leads to Nazi Germany's victory in Europe and takes

the viewer to the ""present""... 1964.

(Note the billboard advertisment for The BEATLES'

 first album)

The movie is essentially a crime drama, pure and

simple. Acting is good, attention to ""period"" detail

is on the money, and the story flows nicely. It is

easy to develope a ""feel"" for the story line early

on. One soon gets a sense that there is something

deeper and more sinister going on than a ""simple""

murder investigation. To say more would give the

plot away. The ending was somewhat disappointing,

but not distractingly so. And fans of Rutger Haur

should appreciate his portrayal of SS Inspector

March.

Without giving away any spoilers, it is simple:  the Normandy invasion of France is an utter failure, and Nazi Germany ultimately becomes the master of Europe, as America turns away from the European war to concentrate on defeating Japan.  By 1960, the ""Cold War"" between Germany ""Germania"" (still ruled by the 75 year-old Adolf Hitler) and the United States is in full swing.  The novel is set in Berlin.  The plot centers on a political murder being investigated by Sturmbahnfuhrer Xavier March, of the German SS Criminal Police.  More would be telling.
This is a very well done film, and I agree with some of the other reviewers that this film is even better than the book.  (By the way, the book is superb as well, and also merits five stars).  This is one of those wonderful films in which the musical score adds an extra dimension to the mood, and Gary Chang deserves kudos for his work here.

That said, I think the movie was as good as it could have been. It clearly looks as though the people making it had some fun (if that's the right word) creating an image of ""Germania,"" the united Germany Empire after Hitler won the WWII. The first few minutes of watching the movie are so disconcerting that one wants to look away from the swasticas and images of content citizens everywhere. What do you say when SS are actually the good guys? Still, once you get used to this warped atmosphere, it's possible to enjoy the movie for what it is... a good thriller. It's not more and not less. According to the premise, Russia is still fighting the war on the Eastern front, and America and Germania are deciding whether to combine their forces and restore peace once and for all.

Harris obviously did his research, and offers the transfixed reader a rare vision of the Hitlerian society had Nazi Germany existed till 1964. But b-a-a-a-a-d plotting flawed this novel-based HBO TV-movie. No character acted with conviction in the story. Much better if Harris had expanded this rather thin novel into a Dune-size novel with proper character-development. Harris could not explain plausibly the motives of Nebe, the Head of the nazi police, in aiding Sturmbannfuhrer Marsh, the leading SS black-clad flatfoot in this futuro-nazi-whodunnit. Perhaps he could have stirred in a plot by top nazis to exploit the scandal of the Holocaust to stage a supremely cynical putsch against Hitler and install a more ""acceptable"" liberal/progressive band of leaders acceptable to the civilized world. Lotsa lost opportunity here. Pity. Read it once to discover the promise that was not. The only visually interesting bit was the CGI recreation of what Berlin might have looked like if Albert Speer's (Hitler's pet architect) freudian designs had managed to get built.

653292,2,6303421903,"""What if?"" movies are interesting only if they stick to this basic premise, but 'Fatherland' discards it in the first reel. Instead you get a so-so police story (I admit I haven't read the novel so I can't tell whether the original plot was any good) and two or three shots worth looking at, particulary the ones where you can morbidly see in virtual reality the pharaonical, somber wedding-cake buildings Albert Speer designed for Hitler's new capital (which was to be named ""Germania"", NOT the country).
Besides that, there's only an implausible 'happy' ending preceded by a lot of obvious bloopers. Just to name a few:
Had D-Day failed, Berlin would have been devastated by the first A-Bomb, not Hiroshima, and Germany would have surrendered anyway. The only believable premise for a Nazi victory is for Hitler having the bomb first. The movie ignores this no-brainer fact.
Hitler would have never rode in a Rolls, much less patched a Mercedes-Benz star on its hood. Hitler had a mania about Mercedeses; he considered them the safest cars in the world and a national pride. The only car he ever rode in aside from them was a prototype VW, and nearly vomited from tension (he never learned to drive).
Rugter Hauer's SS cap is all wrong. Everyone else's are fine, his looks like a milkman's. A big gaffe on the art production department!

7847711,2,6303421903,"In this alternate reality thriller, Hitler won WW2 and controls all of Europe which has been renamed Germania.  Only Russia keeps fighting.  It's now 1960 or thereabouts.  Joseph Kennedy (who many believe was an antisemitic Hitler sympathizer) is the American president.  There has been a cold war between Germania and the United States but Hitler is eager to strike up an alliance so he can finally end the war with Russia.

Author Robert Harris (who wrote the novel on which this cable movie is based) came up with an interesting alternate version of the world had Hitler prevailed in WW2 but he neglected to come up with a story that is plausible or compelling to go along with it.  In Fatherland we are expected to believe that Hitler successfully covered up the extermination of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust and instead pretended that they were all resettled in work camps in the East.  Rutger Hauer plays an SS Officer (they are now civilian police) who uncovers a series of murders that are linked to that big secret.  The Gestapo is having everyone left with direct knowledge of the Holocaust killed to cement the big lie before a peace conference with the American president.

The problem with Fatherland isn't just that viewers or readers know the answer to the central mystery long before it is uncovered by the characters--it's also that the central mystery at the heart of Fatherland simply makes no sense.  It's highly debatable whether Hitler would have chosen to cover up the extermination of Germany's Jews had he prevailed in WW2--the Nazis kept meticulous records of the meeting where the final solution was devised and also of every aspect involved in actually carrying it out.  Timetables of the trains carrying Jews to the death camps were made, the number of Jews in each train logged as was their destination.  The death camps themselves also kept very meticulous records of everything that was done inside their fences.  Why would the Nazis make so many records of something that they later plan to cover up?  And if for some reason Hitler did choose to cover up the extermination of the Jews wouldn't it would make far more sense to claim that they were killed during the war by Russian bombs?  Pretending that 6 million people who are dead are actually still alive really doesn't make any sense.  Let's take the idea at the heart of Fatherland one step further--Hitler achieves detente with America.  Germania is open to American tourists and the United States is open to tourists from Germania.  So after that happens how exactly does Hitler continue to hide the fact that the Jews were exterminated?  Aren't American Jews going to want to see their European relatives who are supposedly settled and treated well in these non-existent camps?  Aren't American journalists going to want to visit the camps?  What about the Red Cross?

The audience knows exactly what Rutger Hauer's SS officer will eventually uncover from the earliest mention of Jews being resettled in the East.  Fatherland never figures out how to make the slow uncovering of the inevitable in the least bit interesting or exciting.  It's basically little more than 100 minutes of waiting for Rutger Hauer to figure out what we already know.  It's also an awful waste of a very promising alternate history.",1506988800,,3304,4.878136200716846
7847712,5,6303421903,"This is a very fine, very well-made, thought-provoking HBO movie that really begs to be released on DVD.

An extremely interesting alternative history, presented as an intriguing mystery set 20 years after World War 2, which Hitler won following the failed Allied D-day landings in Normandy. The Third Reich conquered all of Europe and England, now called Germania. The U.S. went on to defeat Japan and develop the atomic bomb. But Germania also atomic nuclear weapons, and now a nuclear standoff exists between them, known as the 'Cold War.' Since Germany won, the Holocaust was kept a dark secret. However, the war between Germania and Russia is still dragging on and Hitler, now 75, wants to meet with President Kennedy to persuade the U.S. to join Germania to finish off the Russians once and for all.

But disturbing, horrific rumors about German atrocities keep spreading...

Typically high-quality HBO production values. Very well-acted, beautifully-directed, often visually spectacular photography, great script and soundtrack. Not only is it a fascinating look at alternative history, it is also a nicely-written historical mystery with several very ironic twists.

But the REAL mystery here is why this fascinating film hasn't been released on DVD!

I think this is partly because of the thinness of ideas; each scene is stretched out. But also there's a suggestion that Germany was backward. In fact, when Germany lost, their patents and inventions were stolen by the USA, just as their physical factories were stolen by the USSR.

This was filmed in Prague - lots of Jiris and Janas in the credits. Post-production by the cheap Brit tea-drinkers in Twickenham and Shepperton.

Probably Robert Harris (born in Nottingham, 1957, according to online information) had little idea of anything factual. He must have written 'Fatherland' in his mid-30s, after 'working' as a BBC reporter, until (aged 30) being made 'political editor for the Observer', a British 'quality press' title. Fatherland in book form is claimed to have sold a million copies, but there is no information that I could find on the promotional push it must have been given: BBC TV interviews? Copies in the windows of Waterstones? Airport sales?though the author is listed as Fatherland, Co. Ltd. in the TV film's credits.

Harris seems to have turned out many thrillers, but also was a ghost or co-writer, for example with The Columbia Guide to African American History Since 1939, and a book on Political Corruption. He has written, or perhaps a more accurate word might be quoted, or speculated, on 'germ attacks', the USA being deemed 'highly vulnerable'. He wrote on the 'Hitler Diaries' con of 1983, and makes an appearance in David Irving's libel trial of the mute inglorious Lipstadt. He's described as a 'friend' of Tony Blair. A cover blurb of the Alan Clarke Diaries (famous for saying East Timor is a long way away) quotes Robert Harris's description as 'The most compelling account of modern politics I have read'.

The TV film has Rutger Hauer as a blond black-uniformed policeman/ detective. Yes, it's a detective story! And Miranda Richardson as his estranged wife (they have a screen son). For some reason, I thought she was a or the daughter of Ralph Richardson. Apparently not. She was in Black Adder, and I remember her having intercourse tastefully with a black actor, presumably part of the Jewish race-mixing agenda. And the film had .. um.. well, others, less memorable.

The film starts with an odd fake cinema black-and-white newsreel; which even by itself shows Harris's total incomprehension of the issues. It starts with the 'failure of the Allied invasion', as though that wording would have been used. It shows Germany winning the warmeaning in Europe, as 'Germania'but still at war with the USSR under an aged Stalin. The whole point of Hitler was to defeat Bolshevism! Harris has no idea Jews funded the USSR. There's a scene of Eisenhower pretending Eisenhower had ethical reasons for defeating Germany, rather than simple Jewish racism. Harris doesn't know Britain declared war. There's nothing on Poland. The British Empire is tactfully suppressed by Harrisno point reminded Brits, eh! I was amused to see the Trinity fake atomic bomb flash; this was before the days the BBC could fake an atom bomb with computer graphics. Lindbergh was mentioned; as Joseph (born 1888) Kennedy the elder as US President.

Harris got a few thrills with a Sex Crime Unit. This of course is a Jewish preoccupation, attributed by Jewzis to Nazis. For the folks back home. This somewhat eclipses what is presumably meant to be the main plot: six million .. gassed .. bullets too expensive.. etc. And there's a subplot of small son, 'brainwashed' (yes!) by the Nazi thugs, with Rutger Hauer planning to bolt for the free USA.

""Harris ... still remains a very common Jewish name in the UK, Europe and the U.S.""

Anyway, Harris is now about 60, so we can look forward to more sewage from him and his company. Yippee.",1451347200,3,4006,4.888070692194404

7847718,4,6303421903,"I love Rutger Hauer, the guy is one of my absolute favorite actors and I think he played a cool and interesting role for this sci fi fantasy thriller.  Hauer always displays to us his charm, his deep intellect, and his cool style even if the story has him dressed up in the dreaded uniform of a vicious Nazi.

 Plot: Strange alternate universe plot where D-Day fails, and the Allies instead concentrate their efforts against defeating Japan (which they do much quicker).  Britain loses the war, and so does a good bulk of the gigantic miles long end country of Soviet Russia (they retreat to Siberia where a guerilla war ensues.)  Hauer is a super sharp police officer among a group of dummies & political fanatics, living in a regime controlled by apes who despite their visions of a Germanic Aryian utopia they still cannot manage to run an economy or society.  When President Joe Kennedy Sr is scheduled to make an historic peace summit meeting with an elderly, and slightly more mellowed out Hitler, an American journalist named Charlie stubles upon a hidden defector who wants to leak a sinister story of what actually had happened to Europe's Jews (Hauer and others believe they were forcibly relocated to the East in their own settlements.)  Hauer is also investigating the murder of a SS Cadet at a training university, where his superiors try to led him astray and throw stumbling blocks in front of him.

  Hauer befriends this American woman Charlie, where the two find themselves caught in the middle of this dangerous mission to find out the truth from what this defector and his evil sinister Aryian girlfriend actress have to reveal (the Holocaust).

 The premise is based on a best selling fun science fiction fantasy adventure thriller book of the same name, but I found the idea of that regime's survival to be far fetched.

1. Hitler was a very sick man in 1945 before the time he commited suicide in the ""Furher Bunker"" with Eva, both physically and mentally, his Parkenson's disease along with his constant addiction to drugs would have eventually killed him.  I don't believe the historical sinister ""bad guy of all bad guys"" dictator would have survived past 1951.

2. D-Day as a failure would have been a major set back, but never the less the Nazi regime's goose was cooked no matter how one analyzed it.  Diepe was a beach assault failure, but that never stopped the British and later the American forces to attempt the next try which was D-Day.  They were mandated and determined to establish some form of a beachhead on continental Europe.  Russia and the US both had endless resources, logistics, equipment, and in Russia's case manpower to the extreme.  Regardless of how advanced and skilled the EXCELLENT German Soldiers among the ranks of the Wehrmacht were including their advanced weaponry, in the end they simply where out manned and out gunned.

3. Keep something like the Holocaust a secret would have been impossible, unless the regime decided to murder half of it's own party members and military officials tasked with maintaining the camps, handling and guarding the victim prisoners, and some how disguising their over usage of logistics and railroad assets that they had utilized to carry out their final solution, instead of using the railroads and efforts toward the two super power militaries rushing their way on a warpath.

4. The regime's excuses as to why their would be little economic growth, and even maintaining a stable regime would run out eventually cause some sort of unrest and collapse.  Having a small country with their population living in a Hell on Earth could only work if A. that country has an allied neighbor who does have economic success keeping them afloat, and B. if that regime had a fairly smaller territory to control (Think of North Korea as an excellent example).  The Nazi regime controlling all of Europe, a good chunk of the Middle East and Russia, and North Africa for a long period of time with such a terrible political and economic ideological practice would crumble fairly quickly.  Eventually people would starve to death, and one can only run a police state like North Korea holding onto such a vast amount of real estate and people for so long.  Even Russia had to lighten up just a little bit after the years of horror under Stalin, but they too even collapsed in the 90s.

 Either way it is an interesting and fun movie if not very far fetched.  The part where this ""Nazi bitch"" who is a retired actress seeking political asylum in the US, where she explains what really happened to Europe's Jews is really creepy and horrifying.  The scene has her packing a suit case and calmly bragging, while telling the story of how millions of innocent people were slaughtered as if she had met her new boyfriend at the coffee shop.

Hauer carries this brief case in many scenes of the movie, but we don't know what the heck is in it, because it seems we are led to believe it is important to the plot where it really isn't.

 I really did like Rutger Hauer and his character in the movie, screaming at some points saying to the screen, ""Rutger take the kid and get the &%^k out that Hell hole, and get to America as soon as possible!""  Ha lol.

  B- because it is far fetched, & thumbs marginally up for ""Fatherland""",1430179200,,5296,4.712269272529859

7847720,5,6303421903,"Fatherland is a great movie that is highly underrated.

I read the novel and there are a few notable differences between the two; however, both are great stories that have thrilling plot that will keep you attached from beginning to end - even though due to our history we already know the outcome.

A very good mystery story to start out with before emerging neck deep into the alternate world of a victorious Third Reich.  This story (including the novel) is one of the biggest middle fingers to the Third Reich that I have ever seen and it does it in such a subtle way that still managed to keep you guessing what will happen next to all the characters involved.

I just wish this was on the dvd, as it would be a must buy on my list; until then I guess I will just have to enjoy the novel and hope that this makes it into an obtainable media format other than VHS.

Overall this is a must see for anyone that has not seen it.",1407542400,,929,4.196629213483146
