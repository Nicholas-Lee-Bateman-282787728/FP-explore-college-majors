8480972,5,B005O9MH9Y,"A fascinating series of programs by a composer who was right in the middle of the 20s in both American and Paris.  Despite the age of the programs, the images for the most part are clear.  The sound is reasonable.  This is an important historic document.  I only wish there was more of Copland's music.",1420243200,,302,4.4363636363636365
8480973,5,B005O9MH9Y,"An excellent survey of the music produced in the 20's, primarily in Paris, by one who was part of it and met most of the composers who were part of it. A unique opportunity of getting musical history first hand.",1362700800,,211,4.3
8480974,5,B005O9MH9Y,"This superb 3-DVD set contains all the half-hour TV episodes from the mid-1960's WGBH-produced survey of music composed in the 1920's, written and hosted by Aaron Copland. His wry and informative analysis of the many musical developments during this decade is reinforced by in-studio performances that serve as superb illustrations of a particular composer and/or trend. The performances feature a great Boston-based pickup band that is joined by a famous guest performer or soloist. This classic footage of the many well-known performers, as well as Mr. Copland's conducting (in fine mid-60's form) is invaluable.

For curious musicians, this is a major historical document, and well worth the price.",1346889600,,701,5.4907407407407405
8480975,5,B005O9MH9Y,"The description above tells us the facts about this excellent set. Copland was always a fine explicator of music, and he comes across as very personable here. He discusses the significant aspects of the music on a level that would have been comprehensible to a literate music lover of the time (though, sadly, it's probably over the heads of most listeners today). The musical selections are very well chosen, especially since they were logistically limited to nothing larger than a chamber orchestra. The performances by a group of crack Boston musicians, with some bigger-name soloists, are splendid, and Copland shows that he was an excellent conductor. An interesting feature is the abstract stage sets, which usually relate in some way to the music. It's also interesting to see how the perceptions of trends and composers, and their importance, have changed in the last half-century. All in all, a most enjoyable set of programs, and recommendable to anyone interested in the development of Twentieth-century music.",1339632000,4,1021,5.2317073170731705
