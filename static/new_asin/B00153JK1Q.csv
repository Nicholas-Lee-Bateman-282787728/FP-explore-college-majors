I liked it. Go watch it with some queer (allies included) friends that are mature enough to want to learn about another culture and some Tagalog (Philippines national language)

I'm coming from a lens of a Filipina-American POV.[And, btw I am queer myself. I've dated both men and women. It's just dating and labels I tend to go beyond. That's just me.] I'm proud that they put this movie out and it would be helpful to know the culture to have a better appreciation of this movie.

The title hints to the pop culture of the PI. Rome and Juliet?! When I saw that title I already was skeptical because that is typical of the filipino culture to do a play of words in the title. It's rather funny. And, cheesy!

Also, it is obvious part of the story line was copied from the movie Imagine Me and You. But don't expect a comedy. This is filipino drama at a well acted level. Story line was quite choppy. There are elements to it that I could see that the director wanted to express an artistic semi-indie-esque feel like voice overs of Juliet reading poetry and lots of emo music.

I quite by accident discovered this movie on youtube. The subtitles are at par and I don't understand why they created subtitles when they speak English. Annoying.

How I appreciate this movie is I get to see the American / Spanish / catholic influences that impact the main character's growth and confusion about this unexpected new found love. Watching Rome consult a nun was a surprise to me and again made me think about my filipino heritage.

The theme (which I've noticed has been a recurring theme in the past 20 years) in the LGBT community: Two best friends happen to fall in love. This happened to me so again another reason I could connect to it.

If you're looking for steamy sex scenes, there really aren't any compared to today's standard. Expect a made for t.v. lesbian movie.

If you're looking to chill and see a love story with a happy ending (however drawn out) then go grab a loved one, some Halo-Halo (a filipino dessert) and watch it. I really did like the acting between Mylene Dizon and Andrea Del Rosario. They were sweet and tender. And Mylene is just eye candy.

Acting - 4 stars
Attractive cast (I'm totally biased here) 4.4 stars
Script - 2.5 stars
Subtitles - 2.5 stars (if your going to practice be sure you have a very forgiving filipino friend :) )
Ending - 3.8 stars
Personal enjoyment - 4 stars (have a good time with it and tell another filipino about it)

8257466,4,B00153JK1Q,"This film is subtitled, but if you listen carefully to the dialog some of the words actually spoken in English are not the same as the caption; which I found unnerving at times. Overall the story of these two straight women finding their ""THE ONE"" in each other was well weaved through the story. I did think it would have a typical ending, but was pleasantly surprised for a first time film.",1251676800,2,392,4.458333333333333

Actually surprised why this hasn't even one review yet.
Loved this movie especially the cast of Mylene Dizon who is very addictive. Fantastic.  She looks very similar to Reema Sen, an Indian actor.
Story though cliched, has some very intense scenes and beautiful poetry, and again a very hot Mylene Dizon.
The characters are more or less realistic and the love Rome feels for Juliet is very refreshing and great, what with the acceptance of Juliet's decision to still marry Marc.  One wishes such a kind of love exists and celebrated.
Have i said this before - Mylene is simply gorgeous in every way.
The music is fantastic.  Can'f find enough information where to get the soundtrack though, it is not available.

Now for the negatives:
The DVD does not allow to forward the trailers before you get to the movie.
Not many worthwhie extras.
The sub-titling is horrendous.
The lay out is not very pleasant to look at.
The actor who plays Juliet is O.K. in bits and parts, but not a great fit, though in some scenes she is absolutely brilliant and her smile at times is great.

Do yourself a favour, watch this movie.  This though earns a five star because of the mostly fantastic cast, the stroy, great music and great poetry and ofcourse Mylene Dizon.

Take a look at this though it does have a feel of ""Imagine me and You.""  Though a tad too long it will be worth the time!!!",1224547200,5,1397,4.556
