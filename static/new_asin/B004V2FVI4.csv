8442816,4,B004V2FVI4,"Prabhat Roy's 'Hum Intezaar Karenge' is loyal to the decade it released, the 80's. The film has 2 superstars Mithunda & Padmini, a good supporting actor Lt. Vinod Mehra & a conniving villain Shakti Kapoor. The film has memorable songs by Bappida, and good-looking locations.

'Hum Intezaar Karenge' is a okay film, where expectations are not even talked-about. This 1989 fare is meant to be seen once, that's it!

Coming to the acting department, Mithunda was the no. 1 Star when this film was released. He's terrific as always, and steals the show without a doubt. Padmini is good as always. Lt. Vinod Mehra was a very, very fine actor and his work in this film is also commendable. Shakti Kapoor does a fine job.",1305763200,,714,4.704
