7919396,4,B00003TKFA,"This second set of stories about Cordelia Grey was developed for the TV viewer -- as screen plays, not books -- so they may lack some of the deft twists and turns of the typical P.D. James plot, but the writers have done a very credible job. If you like British Mystery, these stories are entertaining.
Why can't a pregnant woman solve a crime--her brain doesn't stop working. Besides, Cordelia's pregnancy works to her advantage in the story on the illegal traffic in babies.  Also, I am interested in Cordelia's doings because she is an complex character in her own right.  If the public had been more accepting of female detectives in the 1960s, would Phylis James have paid more attention to this character and less attention to Dalglish?  Cordelia Grey IS a mystery.
The two British women who play Cordelia Grey and her sidekick Edith are fine actors.  Helen Baxtendale (Cordelia) is intriging.  She isn't the prettiest woman in the world, she has a very prominant nose. But, she has an incredible stage presence and is beautiful.  Apparently she has appeared on American TV -- according to my younger friends, who tell me she had a small role on the TV sitcom ""Friends"" for a bit.  Edith, whose ""real"" name will come to me shortly, played the 6th wife of Henry VIII (the one who out-lived him) in the series with Keith Richardson the BBC dramatized a few years back. She also played the housekeeper in a serial about three doctors set in Scotland just after WWII (starred the late Ian Banning).  She was also the long-suffering spouse in ""One Foot in the Grave"" as fans of ""BritWit"" know (the storyline Cosby uses for his current series).
Well, I love these stories, but I won't buy anymore tapes because they fade and break and they're almost as expensive as the DVDs.  When someone puts it out on DVD I'll get it.",970272000,4,1821,4.630434782608695
7919397,5,B00003TKFA,"I'll admit that I enjoyed the first series of ""Unsuitable Job for a  Woman"" more than this second series.  However, this series certainly  has its own unique and enjoyable qualities.  Cordelia Gray (Helen  Baxendale) is pregnant in these episodes, but that doesn't dampen her  curiousity or drive.  It is alot of fun watching this young pregnant  detective, along with an older female sidekick, uncover hidden secrets and  piece together the truth.  Ms. Baxendale is the perfect example of how  stunning and smart the actresses from the UK are.  I would rather see Helen  in a film, than any actress we have here in the USA.",965520000,4,624,4.828571428571428
