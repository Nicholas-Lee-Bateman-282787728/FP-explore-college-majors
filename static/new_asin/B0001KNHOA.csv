2009863,5,B0001KNHOA,I thought I was in pretty good shape until I did this workout for the first time!  Very intensive for the lower body!  I really can feel the results!,1184976000,,149,4.103448275862069
2009864,5,B0001KNHOA,"This is an excellent lower body sculpting routine that really targets those glute, hip, and leg muscles through use of the Firm Fanny Lifter, a high square step which can be set to three different heights (if you don't have a FL, a full-size adjustable step could probably be used as a substitute).  Firm instructor Lisa Kay does a solid job leading the workout, which comes in right around 30 minutes.  In addition to the FL, various sets of dumbbells are used throughout.

The workout begins with a 6-minute warm-up and stretch using the FL at its mid-range height.  Exercises in the first segment include plies, leg presses on the full FL, hover squats, and then a second leg press series; calf raises are also included as part of the leg press work.  Next comes a short (3 minutes) aerobic section using the low (purple) portion of the FL, which was fun and helped keep the heart rate elevated.  Another toning segment follows, this one with dips, lunges, and squats, and then there is another 3-minute aerobic sequence, this time on the floor (includes some small plyometric jumps).  Yet another set of leg presses comes next plus more calf work, squats, and finally, dips/curtsy dips.  The workout ends with a 3-minute stretch seated on the FL.

Although I haven't always clicked with Firm workouts, I enjoyed this one very much, and I felt that my lower body got an excellent workout.  I also think that the routine is quite customizable to meet your needs:  the first time through, I was already tired from another workout, so I used a bit lighter weights, but you could easily go quite heavy on your weights as well.  Furthermore, I loved that the workout moved quickly, which meant that my heart rate stayed in my target zone for about two-thirds of the workout (eg, over 20 minutes).  I would definitely recommend this routine, especially for those like me who do not enjoy floor work and thus prefer standing exercises for their lower body.",1176595200,,1952,4.722713864306785

2009866,5,B0001KNHOA,"I found this workout to be really great, could not make it through the whole video. Don't Know why people complain about these videos they are awesome. You do need the fanny lifter though I don't have it I have the transfirmer and just use that. You may need weights but I didn't my own weight were good enough.",1153094400,2,311,4.288135593220339
2009867,1,B0001KNHOA,"The Firm Lower body sculpt DVD did not meet my expectations.

Not enough info was offered to let you know that you need to purchase additional equipment (the Fanny Lifter) in order to do the workout.  So once I got the DVD I could not get stared right away.  The moves are very slow, not enough repetitions,  too many routine changes, not to mention the lack of enthusiasm by the instructors.  Lines are definitely learned.  Not unisex friendly.  I could not see my husband working out with me to that routine!  More for ""Stepford Wives""  I have heard that The Firm Series from the 1980's is better than the current.  But I'am not going to experiment.  I'll continue to work out to my Billy Blanks videos.",1142899200,6,705,4.515873015873016
2009868,5,B0001KNHOA,This is classic Firm in only 30 minutes!  The first time I did this tape my legs felt wobbly and I was using some other Firm videos at the time.  It's not so bad now but is still a great workout for those who haven't got an hour to spare.  The instructor is motivating and not cutesy.  This DVD is a definite plus to any serious workout library!  Great for the serious who are short on time!,1138838400,5,391,4.025974025974026
2009869,4,B0001KNHOA,"As Lisa Kay says, ""We have 30 minutes to shape your legs!""  This video definitely accomplishes that.  Lisa is joined by 4 fellow Firm Master Instructors including Libby who demonstrates beginner modifications.  You will need a Fanny Lifter, or stool/step and assorted dumbells.

The majority of the workout is strength work, there are 3 sets of leg presses, some of which incorporate some calf raises, squats, lunges, dips, plie squats, curtsy dips, plus some cardio segments to give the legs a brief break from the weight work while keeping the heartrate up.

This video was quite challenging for me, Lisa does a good job instructing here.  For those looking for short lower body workouts, this is a good choice.  You will work the legs from every angle and then some.  It should be noted that it is all standing leg work, there is no floor work here.  There is another  Firm video available called Lower Body Sculpt II which is all floor work.  Overall a good lower body strengthening routine.",1110067200,24,995,4.794117647058823
2009870,5,B0001KNHOA,"This is a 30 minute lower body sculpting workout led by Lisa Kay, one of my favorite Firm instructors. To do this workout, you need a range of dumbbells such as 5 and 8 pounds. You also need the Firm's FannyLifter, which is 14"" step made up of 6"" and 8"" segments. If you don't have the FannyLifter, you will need a sturdy step of some kind.

The workout consists of a variety of classic lower body strengthening moves. You will do many leg presses, the Firm's signature move, some with tempo variations. Lunges, dips and squats are combined with an emphasis on the calf. There are two aerobic ""break"" segments. In other Firm sculpting videos, such as Total Sculpt with Abs, the aerobic segments are welcome breaks that give you a little rest while keeping your heart rate up there. Not so in Lower Body Sculpt I. The aerobic segments target the same muscles you were just working with weights, so it intensifies the sculpting effect.

This is definitely a worthwhile purchase if you want to focus on sculpting your lower body. I recommend purchasing Upper Body Sculpt as well so you can tone your entire body.",1106265600,15,1109,4.595959595959596
2009871,5,B0001KNHOA,"""Fast & Firm Lower Body Sculpt 1"" was originally part of the Body Sculpting System 1 6-pack of add-on videos.  It uses the Fanny Lifter and three pairs of dumbbells--they generally recommend 3, 5, and 8 pound dumbbells.

I really feel like this video takes shows off some of the trademark Firm moves in a superior fashion.  You haven't experienced the leg press until you've done what feels like eleventy zillion of them in this workout.  Lisa also does sets of modified dips that she calls ""curtsey dips,"" which have you holding weights and curtseying--they will make you feel the muscles in your hips in a serious way!  Once you get stronger, this workout really benefits from ""heavying up"" in places.  When I really want to feel the burn, I'll do a set or two of leg presses and squats with 15 pounders when Lisa Kay calls for heavy dumbbells.

Some people complain about workouts from the Body Sculpting System 1 being boring--plain, uninteresting sets, boring choreography, etc etc.  The sets are plain, and I would describe the choreography throughout the series as ""utilitarian,"" but I think it works to the viewer's advantage, especially in LBS1.  The modifier for beginners is easy to see and follow, the exercises are simple but effective, and the user doesn't get distracted by complicated footwork or strange camera angles and lighting.

This is an awesome lower body workout and really stands on its own among the other BSS1 workouts.  If you really want to work the muscles in your lower body and feel it for awhile afterwards, Lower Body Sculpt 1 will do the job.",1103155200,43,1578,4.785977859778598
2009872,5,B0001KNHOA,Looking for a Video that has lower body and a little bit of cardio? This is it.. I have been working out and I usually do weight training in the gym. When I did this video I was happy to see that I was sore the next day.. Great video for those just starting out.. Make sure you have the fanny lifter (or step) and the stick that you have to use.. Most of the frim DVD require those..,1102204800,9,383,3.8607594936708862
2009921,2,B0001KNHOA,"This DVD was not as difficult as the Classic Firm workouts, in fact, some of the moves seemed not to be strenuous at all. This is for beginners, and in truth, I don't even think a beginner would feel satisfied with this DVD.",1362009600,3,224,4.232558139534884
2009922,1,B0001KNHOA,"It's okay but I noticed with all the firm dvds, they do not go through the routine before the actual workout.",1356652800,,109,4.238095238095238
2009923,5,B0001KNHOA,"My legs feel like jello after doing this one.  This is the first strictly lower body workout that I've done, so I'm used to breaking up lower and upper body work.  This is a typical Firm workout.  I like Lisa as an instructor.  Her cues are good and she is likeable.  Toward the end, she does curtsy dips and I remember thinking at the time that there should be more of those.  This is a tough workout, but it's worth it!",1352678400,,421,4.135802469135802
2009924,5,B0001KNHOA,"I first tried this years ago by renting thru NetFlix and I remembered how fatigued my legs were (and sore the next day). I decided to find this on amazon and purchase it. In 30 minutes you get an intense lower body workout. If you don't feel the burn either you are not doing it right or you need to increase the weights. I burned right at 264 calories according to my HRM doing this 30 minute dvd. There is also a modifier for those who are beginners.

For those complaining about the extra equipment, you need to learn to improvise. Get a regular step stool and make it work.

If you are looking for a quick and effective leg workout please pick this one up.",1282953600,3,660,4.23015873015873

2009926,5,B0001KNHOA,"Very Pleased.  If you are not a person who has oodles of time to spend working out, this is a great, short workout that will burn calories and shape your legs.",1257033600,,159,4.129032258064516
2009927,5,B0001KNHOA,"I like the instructor, the workout is intense, and all I can say today is ouch!  It works you hard!  I am not a beginner, and I had to drop my weights before I hit the first cardio segment.  I will build up to this workout!",1247875200,,223,3.8043478260869565
2009928,5,B0001KNHOA,"I bought the upper and lower body sculpt workouts at the same time because I found them cheap but didn't expect too much (I'm not a big fan of The Firm). Also, for some reason my favorite muscles to work out are always upper body, so it took me by surprise when I didn't like the upper body DVD but LOVED this one! What an efficient, intense and pleasant workout in just 30 minutes! Awesome time-saver to add on to the end of another.
To the reviewers that whine about equipment: If you're not serious about working out at home, go to a gym. However, you can buy a variety of quality equipment online or sporting goods stores at the fraction of the price of a gym membership. Once you have the stuff you will enjoy and look for DVDs that use them. I incorporated my BOSU, step and even kettlebells into this one. You can get inventive and really don't have to have the exact same things that the DVDs use.",1243555200,3,905,4.267441860465116
2009929,5,B0001KNHOA,I have been a Firm believer for years and I have to say this is one of my favorites for lower body.  It is only 30 minutes but it is packed with great toning exercises.  It has modifications for beginners.  This is a must for any Firm believer or anyone who wants a great lower body workout!,1233532800,2,291,4.0701754385964914
2009930,1,B0001KNHOA,"I was very disappointed in this dvd.  Actually, I've never even popped it into my player.  The back says you have to have some equipment to do the exercises, which of course is sold by The Firm and highly overpriced.  I could use other stuff that I have instead, such as a sawed off broom stick handle for the stick and a foot stool instead of their $40 plastic stool.  It's the principle.  I just want to exercise, not fill my house up with a bunch of stuff I'll never use.",1226793600,,474,4.164835164835165

8013840,4,B0001KNHOA,"Where to begin? I have several Firm DVDs, the only one I ever been able to complete is (BBS1Cardiio Sculpt) with Allie. So I have always gone back to Leslie Sansone becaue if anything Leslie gets the heart rate going. Now things have changed the Drs have advised that to move it or loose it and I need something new and challenging. So I thought to myself "" the Firm will do it!"" but how? my knees hurt and I am not physically  up to 1hr long workouts. Here comes this one and Lower body Sculpt II, 30 mins long and with many of the same moves as the other signature firm  DVDs. I own both the Transfirmer and the Fanny lifter and use both. However I am starting with the blue piece (taller part) for the signature move I will keep the fanny lifter fully assemble for the hover squats. I am using 3 and 5lbs for 4 wks then I will move up to the 3 5 8lb for another 4 wks. Then I use the fanny lifter assembled with 3 and 5 lbs for another 4 wks then increasing to the 8lb and up. I will revisit this review mid-way through see how far I get, lol! Wish me luck.",1374710400,,1060,3.971830985915493
8013841,5,B0001KNHOA,I really enjoy this quick but effective lower body workout and always feel the burn the day after.  I own the original Firm Step instead of the updated Fanny Lifter that is used in this video and it works just fine.  The moves are not difficult and will definitely get your heart rate up!,1363651200,,288,4.314814814814815
