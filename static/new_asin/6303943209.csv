This video tells the  hilarious tale of Patsy and Eddie when at last they part. Patsy flies off  to New York to be the fashion editor of an American magazine, and Eddie to  a New age holistic healing clinic. When at last the two come to their  senses, Eddie breaks herself out of the center and makes her way to New  York.
