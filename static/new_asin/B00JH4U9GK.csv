6357023,5,B00JH4U9GK,"Guy (Jason Bateman) is forty years old and an underachieving genius. We discover his mother moved around a lot to escape evictions. As Jason has never finished the eighth grade, he is eligible to enter the Golden Quill spelling contest to the dismay of the kids, parents and the organization. He has an on-line sponsor reporter (Kathryn Hahn) follow him around attempting to get a story, but even she doesn't know why he is doing this.

Guy is rude to just about everyone, especially his fellow contestants with whom he plays mind games. He makes friends with a ten year kid of Indian heritage (Rohan Chand) and indulges him in vices. The reason why he entered the contest was a bit lame, but we needed something for the film.

This is another fun quirky unique indie. It has foul language, ethnic insults, bad sex scenes and 10 seconds of nudity...and it was all fun. Worth watching 4 1/2 stars",1397260800,45,895,4.622641509433962

Bateman plays the ill-natured, genius misfit to a T, while doling out laser sharp insults with a ease that is shockingly funny. Forgive the lame attempts at nostalgia, and ignore the heavy-handed cruelty and implausible plot line and just go with the spirit of it. You will very likely LYAO!",1481241600,,425,4.605263157894737

Me and my husband watched during our home date night and we had to keep pausing the movie while we composed ourselves so as not to miss the next hysterical scene.

6357103,5,B00JH4U9GK,"Jason Bateman is his predictable self...dry and funny.  Story was of course ridiculous, but in a believable sort of way.  Tilby's reason for doing what he does isn't obvious until the end and underlying the ""offensive"" humor is a story of a personal struggle and friendship, which shows that behind the man with a sardonic M.O. and questionable tactics is good person.  The little kid is adorable as is the relationship he develops with Tilby.

Just as funny are the 1 and 2 star reviews so check them out...some people really need to lighten up, which is kind of ironic in the context of this movie.",1466294400,3,600,4.632075471698113

Bateman's ""snarkiness"" is better than ever with some additional  anger behind it and young Rohan Chand plays his role to perfection. ""I'd just say soda, otherwise you're gonna get raped.""- one of many classic, quotable lines that had me howling. Kathryn Hahn (""Don't look at me!"") and Allison Janney were also brilliant. So glad I stumbled across this gem. Not surprised it wasn't featured as an establishment award nominee because the P.C. police clearly cannot get beyond the wickedly inappropriate sub-plots and dialogue. Real people, however, will love this. Well done Bateman.",1465603200,5,664,5.148148148148148

6357169,5,B00JH4U9GK,"Jason Bateman can do it all
he directed and stars in this film, and its to bad it didn't get more promotion when it was in theaters.  If you have watched him from the beggining of his career it was obviouse the guy had chops  his whole family does (his sister just gets to many lifetime movie parts)
Like another reviewer said this is very much like Bad Santa with bill bob thorton,  You really hate the main charcter right from the beginning.  But it is a little formulaic that he has a heat underneath (cliche; but well done)  You finally understand his bitterness and reason behind what he did at end of film and you have sympathy for him while still realizing he is a dick.
It lags in parts  but the montage with the kid  and the sex scene with Kathryn Hahn  is friggin hilariouse
And as other pointed out  has extreme language  and insults  but if you really listen even they are funny as hell
I would call this a cross (pun intended) between Best in show  and Bad Santa

It's such a great movie and has become an instant favourite. It's funny (with bits of crude humour) but also touching as well, which I also liked about it. The cast is wonderful and fit very well together. Overall I really enjoyed it.",1445904000,,563,4.035714285714286
6357172,2,B00JH4U9GK,"Where to start?  First, to pull off good satire/absurdist comedy it requires a certain amount of insight into the human condition beyond what one might encounter in the latest Judd Apatow spectacle of diarrhea-and-d*ldo humor or an afterschool special about latchkey kids.  Second, the crusty-grownup-befriends-spunky-young-innocent-and-finds-his-soul blueprint has been exploited endlessly in film and literature going back to Dickens (most recently resurfacing with Bill Murray's admirable turn as the titular hero of 'St. Vincent'), and with acknowledgements to the lasting value of the formula it must be said that it is absolutely incumbent upon any filmmaker cribbing it to present some distinguishing character nuances, either through dialogue or behavior, that justify taking an audience down that well traveled road.  The disappointing indie 'Bad Words' (2013), directed by and starring Jason Bateman-- an actor whose work I've enjoyed in roles both clever ('Arrested Development') and dumb ('Horrible Bosses,' 'Identity Thief')-- is an ugly, single-note exercise in lowest-common-denominator misanthropy that gives us nothing but false, unlikable characters moving laterally (with no help from a cringingly sophomoric script, credited to first-time Hollywood scribe Andrew Dodge) through what at least might have been a distinctive landscape-- that of the world of spelling competitions-- which unfortunately is given little more than cursory examination and is instead used as a throwaway backdrop for an otherwise listless story.  It's not that I expect the average comic screenwriter today to have the social astuteness and intellectual depth of a Shakespeare or a Wilde or a Chayefsky or a Guest, but if your funniest gags hinge on vagina insults-- and unoriginal ones at that-- I think it's time to reconsider your career path.  1 1/2 stars.",1445904000,3,1856,5.7101449275362315

I just love the whole ""Don't look at me!"" bit she does. Rohan Chand who plays Bateman's spelling bee rival (and friend), Chaitanya is so freaking adorable and hysterical as well. Bateman and Chand's chemistry is real and playful. You can tell they had fun making this movie. I hope Bateman continues to direct but I must say, his acting really blew me away here. He's so funny.

Guy is rude, profane and even takes a little kid to a hooker but darn if I don't like him anyway. Along the way he makes friends with a cute young kid (Rohan Chand) who is a great actor and really provides the lite side the movie needs.

6357345,4,B00JH4U9GK,"Making a film about spelling bee contests and finding some way to make it interesting and entertaining for a movie audience when in reality if you ever were forced to endure one, due to your kid being in it, would be brutally boring constantly watching kid after kid give a repetitive, your word is .... , can you give a definition? Definition is..., Can you use it in a sentence? An example is given, kid starts spelling the word and either gets it right or wrong.  Then we move onto next after next contestant.  So the challenge, beyond an adult finds a loop hole to compete was going to be keeping the audience believing the spelling bee comp is real and happening and at the same time stopping you the watcher from falling asleep due to boredom.

So what do Bateman and the other writers come up with.  Make the adult contestant completely unlikeable, he's not just a jerk, he has no moral wall, even with children, he'll do whatever it takes to make the final and win it. If a kid starts to bully him, he'll retaliate like a child, but with his 40 years life experience to out banter them and win the encounter.  He doesn't care if the kid is maybe emotionally damaged for the foreseeable future due to what he says, or even does.  As the contests move up into the finals his character will even take the initiative to be a bully and take out rivals with mind games who had no malicious intentions towards him.

This is where the writers could have gone two ways, either make this a film aimed at children (particularly the same age as the contestants) with a lot milder outwitting and manipulating fellow contestants, or make it for adults going down the road that Family Guy, South Park and those sorts of crude humour pushing boundaries shows do, such as making a girl think she is having her first period just before she gets up to the microphone with a squirt of tomato sauce. This film goes with the second, so won't be in everyone's taste.

By going the second route it also gets to deal out a bit more punishment on the living vicariously pressuring your child to win at all costs so you can tell everyone, hey that's my kid up there pathetic parents, as well as people who organise and run these sort of child exploitation contests in the first place.  This is a societal problem seldom tackled with movie makers, Little Miss Sunshine and Bad Grandpa are the only two I can think of, they both involved child beauty pageants, a little bit easier target maybe than spelling bees to make an entertaining film around.

Like with some episodes of Family Guy or Southpark there are parts of this film which seem to be just trying to be crude than actually delivering laughs.  The sex scenes with the journalist don't add anything to the film and further raise the question of why exactly is a journalist this interested in this story and the adult contestant to the extent she paid for his hotels in the early rounds and other expenses?  The journalist side of things is never really explained, at one point I thought she was there as she was pregnant with his child but this didn't seem to be the case.  When Bateman's character tries to give his new friend, a ten year old's dreams come true experience, it probably should have ended up with his character in jail, and with a record resulting him not being allowed around children.  In fact if the pathetic parents and sabotaging old woman running the contest had been smarter they'd have had someone watching him or even set something like this up to frame him themselves, and take him out of the contest that way.

Bad Words isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea. There will be some who will even be offended by some of the stuff in it. It may well have got a wider audience if it had been made as more of family audience oriented film, but it also may have been a lot weaker one and may not have worked, as they still would have struggled with how to make a film about a boring competition, entertaining.  We know that they did achieve this going with the other option.  I'd rate this three and a half stars.",1413504000,,4074,4.439678284182306
6357346,4,B00JH4U9GK,"Sort of a twisted, black comedy version of About a Boy (with elements of Bad Santa thrown into the mix), Bad Words tells of an unlikely relationship between a cynical, child-hating adult and a gregarious  ten-year-old who insists on being his friend.

Guy Trilby is a single, hyper-obnoxious 40 year-old elementary school dropout who, much to the consternation of children, parents and contest organizers around the country, has decided to force his way into spelling bees where he competes against - and invariably bests - groups of brainiac youngsters.  Chaitanya Chopra is the relentlessly cheery and upbeat child-whiz who tries to befriend - and defeat - Trilby at the Golden Quill Spelling Bee right there on national television for all the word to see.

Its awfully hard to like Trilby at times, as he smugly sabotages the other players chances at taking home the trophy. Yet, Jason Bateman (who also directed the film) manages to make a potentially repellent character both amusing and oddly endearing. Perhaps thats because Trilby always says what he thinks, cutting through all the BS, skewering social norms and puncturing balloons of political correctness as he goes. What he doesnt count on is meeting his match in the form of Chaitanya, who ultimately wears the middle-aged man down with his open-hearted honesty and frankness. And young  Rohan Chand matches his older costar moment-for-moment and scene-for-scene.

Allison Janney, Kathryn Hahn and Phillip Baker Hall round out the cast.

Unsurprisingly, the script by Andrew Dodge does go a bit soft at the end, but there was probably no way of avoiding it given the arc this type of story naturally follows. Plus, it provides the context that makes all that comes before it suddenly make sense.

You may be put off by the movie at times, but thats just what makes it so much fun to watch.",1413504000,,1853,4.97411003236246

6357350,1,B00JH4U9GK,"Child exploitation is unacceptable. There is no moral compass at play here when you have an eight-year-old child saying the F-word like it's a common, acceptable word. VERY poor judgement on the part of the cast, writers, director, producers, and crew. Basically, everyone who was involved in this movie, including the offended children's parents, should be ashamed of themselves. I guess greed really does have no moral boundaries. Bad Words could have been very good, but it fails miserably in light of the darkness within the allowing of children to experience, first-hand, adult-oriented material.

This is what Jason Bateman's character gleefully does in this flick:

1) He uses sexual profanity with kids.
2) He teaches the boy tons of ""bad words.""
3) He teaches the boy how to steal.
4) He teaches the boy how to get drunk.
5) He buys the boy sex magazines.
6) He talks to the boy in a vulgar way about sex and women.
7) He hires a prostitute for the boy.
8) He abuses kids with sadistic mind games.
9) He takes the boy from his school and takes him on a reckless joyride.

It is ALL entirely unacceptable, and all involved should pray very hard about their standings as an upright and decent human being.",1413244800,6,1212,4.7075471698113205

6357363,3,B00JH4U9GK,"Bad Words was just that bad...just kidding.  A spelling bee loser sets out to exact revenge by finding a loophole and attempting to win as an adult.  This film was written by Andrew Dodge and it was directed by Jason Bateman in his film directorial debut.

An adult, Guy Trilby (Jason Bateman) a school dropout, finds a loophole in the rules of the largest spelling bee in the USA known as The Golden Quill and he decides to compete in it.  His reasoning behind this is because he wants to exact revenge for something that happened to him when he was younger.  With the help of Jenny Widgeon (Kathryn Hahn) and online he sets his plan into motion and starts competing.  As the competition goes on he connects with one of his competitors Chaitanya Chopra (Rohan Chand) and they grow fairly close.

Throughout the competition Guy is constantly doing thinks to psych out his competition to make it easier and quicker for him to win the title.  One thing he does is tell a boy next to him that he got with his mother and had some fun with her.  He even hands her a pair of panties to make him believe it a bit more.

This was a pretty decent film to watch, not my favorite but fun all the same.  It was an interesting concept to have a grown adult compete in a spelling bee.  I don't know of many people who would want to do that to get revenge for things that happened to them in the past, or to just do a spelling bee in general.  I can handle language but it seemed to get a little over the top in this film, granted I guess that is part of the reason why the title is Bad Words, but the same film could have been made with 1/3 of the amount of foul language and it would have been just as funny.  I don't understand why people turn to foul language to bring humor to things because it can be done in a clean way.  Now don't think I am against foul language or anything like that but when the F* word starts to drown a film out, it hurts the value of the film.

Everyone that was in this film did a wonderful job and had amazing chemistry which I enjoyed a lot.  Especially the scenes where Guy and Chaitanya are together those were the best of the whole film.  Bateman and Chand together made this film because any part without them together just wasn't that good.

Overall I would have to give this film a C.  It's because of the overuse of foul language and not enough interaction between Bateman and Chand that it gets the grade that it does.",1412380800,,2445,4.206008583690987

That business aside.....this movie was hilarious! Jason Bateman's funniest role in a while. He is an unlikable jackass the entire movie. But the people who hate him are so ugly about it you start rooting for Bateman. Also, it's just a movie so it's not like he's a real horrible person you are supporting.

6357396,3,B00JH4U9GK,"Bad Words is an interesting film. Set around an adult who finds a loophole that allows him to compete in a national children's spelling bee the film has a lot of potential because it doesn't err on the side of comedy for comedy sake. It's a fairly serious movie underneath the witty dialogue and sharp performances. The movie is well written and well acted but like so many comedies it makes a few fatal mistakes with the main character.

First, Jason Bateman's character (the protagonist) is extremely unlikable. This serves a purpose in the overall story but some of the thing he does are so vile that when it comes time for him to be redeemed the film fails miserably.

Second, the underlying motivation of Bateman's charatcer (reason he's competing in the spelling bee) is very underdeveloped and hurts the ending of the movie.

I give it three stars because there is a lot to like about the movie and the dialogue is fantastic. Unfortunately the problems with Bateman's character drag the film down far enough to make it a one time rental and not a permanent purchase.",1411084800,,1073,4.696808510638298

Pairing a middle-aged man with a 10 year old kid to hit the town and indulge in drinking and debauchery was just too much! One of the scenes was so perverted for a kid to be involved in it was uncomfortable to watch.  The writer, director and Jason Bateman should be embarrassed to have made this film.

6357524,4,B00JH4U9GK,"Almost immediately, I thought Bateman must have produced this movie himself.  After watching it a second time, I saw he also directed it.  It gave me the impression he really wanted to show more of himself, and if nobody was going to invest in it, he would just do it himself!

He has mostly been a supporting actor, or part of an ensemble, and I think after all the years of experience he's had in the business, is wanting to establish himself in a lead role that drives the film, and his obviously good eye as a director.

He can do comedy with his eyes shut, and maybe this will ease him into contention for more serious leading men roles, if he's interested.

I saw Jake Gyllenhaal in a movie called,  ""Love and Other Drugs"", with Anne Hathaway, a couple of years ago, where he played a cocky, accomplished womanizer.  (Quite a lot of non-gratutious nudity, by the way)

He looked really fantastic, and at first I thought he had lost some weight, worked out.............which he did, I'm pretty sure.  But I'd never seen him generate that kind of sex appeal.

I had to really look hard, and then see an earlier film, but I''m pretty sure he has had some serious cosmetic surgery.

When I thought about it more, I realized it was probably a very strategic career decision, which would mean the difference of millions of dollars in earnings in leading men roles, and being able to command the kind of power in Hollywood that would allow him to call his own shots.

I think Bateman is in a bit of the same boat, and putting himself in a role, that although the character was ultimately redeemed,  was not sympathetic through most of the movie.

I think it was a bold move on his part, and hope it is a breakout for him to get  jobs and recognition that will move his career ahead.",1408147200,,1781,4.420245398773006

6357561,4,B00JH4U9GK,"Oh Jason Bateman. It seems like Jason Bateman has a knack for being able to do humor in such a way that will make you blush in embarrassment. Although this isn't one of his best works, it was still worth the rental.

Some spoilers w/ short plot synopsis ahead:

This movie follows Jason Bateman's character, who finagles a loophole in order to be able to attend an elementary spelling bee. But it seems as though Bateman isn't doing this to spite the kids he's going up against, it seems as though he has an ulterior motive.

Bad Words is full of crude satirical humor, as some of the things that Bateman's character does to beat other contestants are despicable, but they definitely made me chuckle. A quick word of advice for those about to watch this movie: Suspend any sense of morality you have before you watch this movie, otherwise some of the jokes may end up being offensive.

In my opinion, this movie is more of a rental than it is a buy. Since I've watched it, I haven't had any desire to watch it again. But it will give you an enjoyable night on a day when you want to enjoy some crude jokes.",1407542400,,1106,4.354368932038835
6357562,3,B00JH4U9GK,"Bad words tells the story of a man (Bateman) who is out for revenge to win it all in a child's spelling bee.

This movie is another one of those crude almost dark humor type (like Bad Santa) comedies that isn't always necessarily laugh out loud funny as opposed to cringe inducing you cant take away your eyes from the crash type of humor filled with crude language, one line smart ass comments and some silly scenes (especially those with the female reporter) that make you almost spit out your drink. It isn't the funniest I have ever seen and treads some familiar territory at times but it does have its moments that made me laugh.

The story of course is a bit out there and silly and the ending predictable for the most part but is enough to keep the crude humor going.

Although not my favorite comedy of the year, I was ok with watching it once, although not sure if there was enough here for a second watch.",1407542400,3,915,4.3391812865497075
6357563,4,B00JH4U9GK,"Dark Comedy fans rejoice! Jason Bateman's directorial debut is not only great, but one of the best dark comedies to be released in a long time!

The plot revolves around Guy Trillby (Bateman) a Middle School dropout who after finding a loophole in the rules, enters himself in a school spelling bee not only to win, but also to extract revenge. While it sounds like a simple plot, there's a little more to it than the synopsis would lead you to believe. Part of what makes the plot so intriguing is not only the sheer absurdity of it, but also Guy's reasoning behind what he is doing is left a mystery and isn't revealed till later in the film.

While Jason Bateman is a great actor, he has been type-casted as the straight man in almost everything he has starred in. That isn't the case here. In what is probably the best performance of his career, Bateman has abandoned his typical role to play the foul-mouthed, narcissistic, and psychotic lead character and does so perfectly. It's not only great to see him play this role because he does it so well, but because it shows that he isn't a one-note actor. Rohan Chand who plays a fellow spelling bee contestant who friends Guy also does a fantastic job and is one of the best child actors I've seen in a film in quite sometime.

Now if you find vulgar humor and profanity offensive, stay away from this film! This is a comedy, but a rather dark one that's in the vein of something along the lines of Bad Santa. While the humor is very vulgar and mean spirited, the film is absolutely hilarious! It never gets quite as raunchy as one might expect, but that doesn't make it any less hilarious. Much of the humor comes from watching Guy find ways to advance through the competition at the expense of his competitors. As terrible as I felt for it, I laughed almost uncontrollably throughout most of these scenes.

But the most surprising thing about Bad Words may be that behind all of it's dark humor and mean spiritness, it's actually a very heartwarming and feel-good movie and has a pretty good message about letting go of the past.

The only real complaint I have the film is that it's very predictable. After Guy's motives are revealed, you can tell exactly where the film is going and it becomes very clear what the outcome of everything is going to be. Despite this, it doesn't take away any of the laughs the film has to offer.

If you can get past it's predictability and vulgarity, Bad Words is one of the best comedies to be released in a long time! It's nice to see a comedy that isn't afraid to puss the envelope a bit and at the end of it still manage to be heartwarming. Bateman has proved that he is both a talented filmmaker in-front of and behind the camera and I'm looking forward to seeing what he does next!",1407542400,7,2777,4.435294117647059

Jason Bateman is great (as is his direction) but the true star of the film is Rohan Chand. This up-and-comer holds his own against Bateman, and then some.

Why mess with kids and their parents in order to exact revenge on one person - who, at the end of the day, was more annoyed by what was going on than anything else?

6357674,4,B00JH4U9GK,"BAD WORDS the title says it so you should be aware that you will find plenty of them in this film written, produced, acted n directed by Jason Bateman so even though that's the case is hard to admit it but although Bad Words are not pleasant when you hear them in movies specially if u hear the F word being said as often as in this movie sounding like so many included in the script so he could manage to have a script long enough to make the movie last bit less than two hours. The weird thing about it is that in this movie they come across in such a way you get to a point where u begin to accept them and as hard as it is for me to accept saying this they become part in a sarcastic way for them to be there that they almost grown in you due to the plot hence the reason for the title movie
Jason plays at successful 40 yrs old business man that takes time off from work specifically to join the competition ""as a contestant"" of the now famous annual spelling bee after finding a Loophole within the rules of the competition that no matter how old a person is if you have never completed your education passed the 8th grade you are in fact eligible to be part of it and compete among the rest of the kids. It does strikes a bit funny when you see this grown adult man sitting between 30 to 40 kids that are there to compete as well. When the organizers of the spelling bee at about to begin the first competition and noticed him on stage and of course delaying the contest as they try to convince Jason he is not allowed to participate only to have Jason remind them ""word per word"" as to regulations of the competition which he learned each page and paragraph of them and recited to them with a warning that he would file an injuction to delay the competition and take them to court therefore delaying the whole process where they eventually give into allowing him and to be part of it. Of course as expected he starts winning them as they go from town to town and the amount of kids start reducing by the time they get to the national televised final one but still a decent amount of them still make it as well and try to give Jason's character a run for his money. Of course by this point everyone involved in the competition has heard of what he is doing from protesting parents demanding he gets thrown out by the officials but apparently not being able to. Of course this doesn't stop the director of it all whom dislikes very much in accordance with the parents promising them she will handle the matter or resign her 30 yrs position if she is not succesfully doing so by the time competition ends and she goes far enough to insert into the computers some pretty long and difficult words that no one ever heard of and for a regular person would be hard to spell correctly making sure that thru the competition these words would appear at the precise moment is Jason's turn to come to the mike and nailing the spelling correctly every word. During the competition there are some mean but funny jokes done by Jason to kids seating near his area causing the kid to walk out on the competition but there were not bad things he would do to them he would just plain with their brain while waiting their turn to diminish the kids confidence and does it successfully.
Thru the movie he develops a friendly relationship with a particular kids that does a superb job as a supporting job. However, this relationship is different than one would have would a kid, and NO there is nothing sexual about it Jason is just kind of a loner and has been for most of his life when his mom died young and his father walked out on them when he was barely walking he tells you this while opening up to this kid whom has had such a deprived life by his parents by not allowing him to be ""a kid"" and the kid even though Jason treats him like crap while they are together by using bad words and giving the kid the ""finger sign"" as a goodnight gesture which the kid enjoys in the way that he gets to understand Jason and his way. There is a point to all this Jason does as well as a very good reason for doing it once he finds out something about the coordinators of the competition to which he enters it not to take away the award from any kid usually monetary which he really doesn't need but if not for other reason than revenge and he does it well. Not wanting to be a spoiler and telling you what that is you have to watch the movie yourself as long as you can handle the F bombs thru it more often than and simply because in its own way the movie works as after all and I will warn you that although there is humor in this movie is NOT hahaha humor, but more of the kind that comes dry and sarcastic!",1406073600,,4690,4.17199558985667

But why this film for his directorial debut?  It's soaked in foul language and mean-spirited behavior for no reason other than shock value.  Except that all the foul language, all the subversive antics hurled toward the kids competing in the bee, and all the bizarre and down right creepy sexual encounters (with the tag-along reporter) don't shock the audience as much as they repulse the audience.  We are pummeled to death with this stuff from beginning to end, so it's no surprise we are left with no connection to the character.  Nor do we have the slightest desire to understand his motivation behind his belligerent and aggressive intrusion into a nationally and annually held spelling bee for kids.  When we do find out why, we can't help but wonder if this film's ending is possibly the most anti-climatic in the history of films.

6357734,4,B00JH4U9GK,"Words are fun, aren't they? Although it may seem impossible to learn them all, some people take pride in their ability to memorize a large portion of them, and this ability is usually put on display in the form of a spelling bee. It may be true that learning the spelling of a word and learning its definition are two very different concepts, but they usually go hand-in-hand when you think about it. Some words sound the same and have two conflicting meanings, and understanding the small differences between them is usually the deciding factor in these competitions, but I digress.

After a pretty lengthy career, Jason Bateman has finally made his directorial debut, and the end result is Bad Words. It should be noted that this movie will not hold your hand; it's not here to be politically correct, and it doesn't care if it offends you. It's made clear that Guy Trilby (Bateman) is not the best person in the world, and he even admits his faults throughout the film, so the easily offended should probably avoid this film at all costs. He's just a character in a movie, and there are people just like him in the world. However, as vile as Guy is, his personality is nowhere near the reason this film isn't a roaring success.

My opening bit about words and spelling bees wasn't written for my amusement, of course, because Bad Words centers almost exclusively on linguistics. Guy Trilby is a 40-year-old middle school dropout who manages to weasel his way into The Golden Quill, the largest, and most prestigious, spelling bee in the country. There's no arguing that Guy is the epitome of the term ""loser,"" but there's no denying that his knowledge of linguistics is impressive, to say the least. How he got this talent, or why he's forcing his way into a spelling bee made for children, no one knows, but they will soon enough.

However, this is easily one of the film's biggest faults: it takes too long to get to the punchline. The film runs at just under 90 minutes, and it isn't until the last ten that the audience is finally given an explanation. I normally would not have an issue with this, but I couldn't shake the feeling that the big reveal lacked the emotional impact the writers were aiming for. It helps humanize Guy in the eyes of the viewer, yes, but this is all it really accomplishes. The information could have easily been integrated an hour earlier, and it would have had the same affect.

Still, a large part of me feels like this is one of those movies that emphasizes the journey more than the destination. Because of Guy's eccentric personality, as a viewer I ached to learn more about him. I wanted to know what made him tick, and why he was so broken and lost in this world. I wanted to know what drove him to enter the spelling bee, and what he could possibly hope to gain afterward. The answers to these questions were all revealed at some point during the movie, and while I can't say I was satisfied with all of them, I had fun nonetheless.

This is because Bad Words is not short in the comedy department. On the contrary, it starts off at a sprint, and it doesn't slow down until the credits start rolling. This is largely accomplished because of Guy as a character and as a personality. It has been a while since we have seen a character this blunt, manipulative, and apathetic, and Jason Bateman played the role wonderfully. I've been a fan of his for a while now, and I can safely say that this has become one of my favorite performances from him. Everything feels so fluid and natural, and I know it's wrong, but I thought it was hysterical when he was antagonizing the little kids.

Not all of the comedy was necessarily perfect, though, and most of the weak material came form Guy's antics with Chaitanya Chopra (Rohan Chand), a contestant in the spelling bee. There is a montage about halfway through with Guy and Chaitanya going around wreaking havoc, and this segment is probably the hardest to swallow (it was also the most unbelievable). During this time, we see Guy and Chaitanya stealing, drinking alcohol, and messing around in a grocery store. From the minimal time we spent with Chaitanya up to that point, his actions felt extremely out of character, and you can't tell me someone of his age is going to be functioning properly after taking shots.

Overall Score: 7.7/10 - I was excited to see Bad Words, and to be honest I got exactly what I expected from a comedy of this caliber. It isn't perfect, but it isn't terrible. It's funny, but it's not the funniest film ever made. My point is, it's a lot of fun, and if you can drop your guard and understand that this is a fictional character who says offensive things because he's ignorant, you'll probably enjoy yourself. Although I can't stand by paying full price for the Blu-Ray or DVD, I would strongly advise picking it up on sale or viewing it as a rental at the very least.",1405641600,,4886,4.545454545454546

6357738,1,B00JH4U9GK,"Under the guise of a Hollywood raunchfest, we are treated to the sad pattern of pedophilic ""grooming"" of a child:

*Engages him in vulgar sex talk that breaks down his modesty and boundaries.
*Enlists him in breaking rules or even laws, so that the two of them share a ""secret.""
*Introduces him to alcohol.
*Shows him pornography.
*Introduces the boy to sexual activity of a seemingly innocent sort.

After the end credits, the audience is left wondering if Guy Trilby takes the final step of engaging in a sex act with Chaitanya.

There seems to be no boundaries today within which to frame a comedy.
Global prevalence for child sexual abuse is estimated at 19.7% for females and 7.9% for males.
In this group, there is a high incidence of substance dependence and psychiatric disorders as adults so it is vital to teach children to recognize grooming behavior.

Anna Calter, PhD is a respected authority in this field,  ""The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies a central role in the interactions with children....The grooming process often seems similar from offender to offender, largely because it takes little to discover that emotional seduction is the most effective way to manipulate children.""

6357795,4,B00JH4U9GK,"There are all kinds of words out there to use to describe ""Bad Words,"" but finding the right ones might be tricky. It might also be tricky to describe just what kind of movie this is. Sure, it's comedy and Jason Bateman is totally the right person for his role. It might be a social issue story about bad childhoods and tough luck adult lives. Or it might be a story about child neglect and abuse, but not totally. So, just what is ""Bad Words?""

For one thing, Bateman, actor and director, is up front about content. There are plenty of ""bad words,"" many of which are said by the ten-year-old boy actor who is Bateman's main competitor in a prestigious national spelling bee. Also perfect is the boy's comic timing--it's incredible, or perhaps the director was on cue in his direction. When the boy is encouraged to use bad words, he blurts out with ""m-f"" so forthrightly that the viewer must wonder if he has used such words before.

So what do bad words have to do with anything? Bateman's character meets all the requirements to participate in the contest, including never finishing the eighth grade. Lest you think he is not bright, the viewer learns that this character is a genius, which becomes quite evident during the spelling phase. The director of the bee, out of outrage that Bateman has bested all the adults in preventing him from participating, rigs the contest so that he gets all the 40-letter words, which, of course, he can spell.

Bateman uses any unethical, tacky, downright immoral tactics to disqualify various contestants. Chaitanya spends his contest time in a hotel room alone. His dad wants him to be his own man. What? Alone? A ten-year-old? Bateman takes him out for recreation and fun, his version. Expect the unexpected. And it's all funny (I say under my breath because showing a ten-year-old a prostitute's huge breasts just does not seem right...).

See? Words just cannot do this movie justice. It is so uniquely funny, even though repulsively so. After Bateman digs in under the viewer's skin, he becomes Everyman in a plot to get justice, no matter how. Comic bite and poignant justice are served equally well. I really appreciated both Bateman's intent and delivery of intent. The movie, I predict, will become a classic.",1405209600,,2259,4.755102040816326

I am not easily offended but this movie surprised me as to the lengths it went at times, the previews really did not sell it as that type of movie. Overall it was an original movie but with a very predictable ending by the time you got there. Half of the laughs were awkward ones of ""wow, did he really just say that to that kid?!"" more than they were laughing at the pure humor of it. It seemed the writers went as far as they could push it just to play shock jock rather than rely on actual humor. Just my take. I don't regret the rental, it was entertainment.

6357820,4,B00JH4U9GK,"""I had plenty of opportunities to stop and make a good decision but that would require the kind of lesson I was never taught."" Guy Trilby (Bateman) is a high school dropout. Now in his 40's he finds a loophole and begins to compete in the Golden Quill Spelling Bee. Not only does he have to compete against kids 1/4 of his age but the parents of the kids are very upset about this. Those in charge of the bee are also against this but technically he is in the rules so they can't do anything. A reporter is following him around trying to find the reason why this is happening but he remains steadfast in his quest until he meets Chaitanya Chopra (Chand). For my money Jason Bateman is one of the funniest people around and the fact that he wrote and directed this made me want to see it that much more. I will say this wasn't what I was expecting...it was much better. The best and easiest way to describe this is a toned down (but not by much) version of Bad Santa. An adult with a grudge and no real morals befriends a kid but doesn't change who he is at all. If you get offended easily this may be one to think twice about because there are some things that make you laugh at the uncomfortable aspect of what is happening. The movie is excellently written and the cast is great. Bateman is great at playing a jerk but still having some heart. For me the best part of the movie is that there isn't the sappy moment that usually happens in movies like this. Overall, if you liked Bad Santa then watch this. Very funny and laugh out loud funny throughout. I highly recommend this. I give it an A.",1404777600,2,1596,4.218954248366013

6357824,1,B00JH4U9GK,"This was a very atrocious, tasteless and dry up production that I have had the misfortune of seeing. No, it's not that awful as other films that have been produced, it's not that common to introduce this type of plot and present it as comedy so there's something out of the usual somewhere in this film. However, just because the plot sequence hasn't been replicated and duplicated one hundred times before doesn't essentially mean that this is a masterpiece of comedy or anything else really. Unfortunately the plot serves no real standing power over my liking of this film, because it serves no real life purpose or makes little to no sense.

Jason Bateman's character is a 40 Year Old, unmarried, possibly psychotic man with a hateful attitude towards life. For some unknown reason he feels like he should enter the spelling bee competition set for children because he is really good at spelling, and so he enters and so he tries to win the contest and has relationships with this child as well as the online website representative who is sponsoring him, all the while bad mouthing everyone and being as unlikable as possible.

That was just a very general review of the plot. Not funny, not smart and absolutely boring. I cannot understand how someone even thought about this as being a good idea for a film. Surely there are better motion pictures out there that are actually hilarious.

6357831,4,B00JH4U9GK,"Let me first say that this is a refreshingly new comedy.  It spikes into dirty jokes unexpectedly, dips into heartwarming territory without being corny or fake, and holds your attention with a small--some might say predictable--mystery till the last.  A few times you will THINK you see a predictable turn coming, then Bad Words will steer clear of the nauseating stuff Hollywood comedies drag us through SO often.  Characterization is done well.  You start off hating Mr. Trilby and end up loving him and empathizing with him.

The ONLY flaw I saw was an obviously restraint coming from Bateman.  Maybe because there were kids in the production.  But he can be WAY funnier, cleverly dirty, and pack on the adult-sized laughs if he wants.  It felt like some scenes were not written to their potential comedically.  Still--don't get me wrong--none of the scenes were boring or superfluous.

Bateman is a smart, funny guy.  I will always watch any movie he makes.  I see him having a BIG future after watching this.  I hope he makes more comedies and just lets loose.

Bateman plays the role of Guy Trilby, a 40 year old man, who has discovered a loop-hole in the Golden Quill Spelling Bee competition that will allow him to participate (much to the dismay of EVERYONE involved).  He is accompanied by Jenny Widgeon (Kathryn Hahn), a writer for an internet newspaper.  Upon arriving to the finals, he becomes friends with a very unlikely candidate, Chaitanya Chopra (Rohan Chand).  (I'm not sure where this kid came from, but there could not have been a better choice for this role!  The chemistry between Bateman and Chand is flawless and I loved every minute of it!)

Over the years I've watched Jason's career grow, and read this, heard that, you know how Hollywood goes. From what I hear, he's a good guy, love to meet him some day.

This movie was great, it showcased Jason's sense of humor, the fact that he was directing his own actions was even better. He's been funny for years, but he took his sarcastic and potty humor to a whole other level, and no one can say the F word better than Jason.

Throughout the movie I kept waiting for the big reveal, as to why a 40 year old man would enter children's spelling bees. The answer is revealed eventually, and everything makes sense, but the transition is fun. I'm not a movie spoiler, you'll just have to watch this for yourself.

But, the best part of this movie is, Jason is such a D***k!

Its so funny, he's mean and rude, and sometimes you have to say, "" Oh good Lord, he so did not just say that."". The way he does it is great, humour all the way. And the facial expressions, he's getting better and better at it.

I would recommend this movie to comedy fans that like adult humour.

6357840,3,B00JH4U9GK,"Inchoate', meaning underdeveloped and rudimentary, is one of the words Jason Bateman's character spells in the Golden Quill spelling bee. It's also a highly appropriate word to describe the film itself. Jason Bateman is clearly getting his footing as a director and the screenplay doesn't quite rise above the obvious tropes. It follows a rather basic and unsurprising storyline, and while it's fun to watch Bateman's vulgarity, the shock humor comes off as forced on more than one occasion. The performances are pretty one note, as none of the characters go through any drastic emotional changes. Bad Words shows hints of promise for Bateman behind the camera, but in the grand scheme of things, it's a pretty mediocre comedy that doesn't stand up well under scrutiny.",1402358400,4,769,5.111111111111111

He's more than established himself as one of the funniest dudes on the planet, and has proven that with his many wisecracking and witty characters. But his great acting isn't the only thing he showcases with his new movie ""Bad Words"", which also serves as his directorial debut, and an impressive one at that.

The story centers around Guy Trilby (Bateman), a middle-aged nobody who finds a loophole in a children's spelling bee and is determined to win. Despite facing much uproar from his competitors parents, he wins his regionals, and moves on to the national competition. Meeting a hilarious Indian boy named Chaitanya along the way, we follow Guy's outrageous attempt to take the grand prize.

Sharply funny and extremely well-acted, I couldn't get enough of this great comedy.

6357842,4,B00JH4U9GK,"Adults acting like selfish children? In today's cinematic world, this should be a surefire winner, but... In this R-rated comedy (raunchy language, giving alcohol to a child, anatomical humor, sexual situations and partial nudity) a grown man intends to compete with school children so he can win a spelling bee and get revenge for a long-held grudge.

Jason Bateman wears a director's hat for this one; he has often directed TV shows, but this seems to be his first film. I wish he had chosen a more likable character to portray. This guy seems to be in a state of... should I say it? ""Arrested Development."" ...smile...

Here is his cast:
  * Jason Bateman (""Identity Thief"") Guy finds a loophole in the rulebook and really, really wants to win that contest! Even after we learn his motive, he remains an abrasive, self-centered loner (this character is a proof reader by trade).
  * Rohan Chand (""Lone Survivor"") Chaitainya Chopra is the boy equally determined to bring home that trophy...well, his dad is.... Being bullied at school is only part of his problem.
  * Kathryn Hahn (""We're the Millers"") Jenny is a reporter for the on-line publication that sponsors Guy. She is trying to discover his real motivation for this outlandish maneuver.
  * Allison Janney (""The Way Way Back"") Dr. Bernice Deagan is the director of the spelling bee. She is determined to thwart our hero's attempt to win this contest.
  * Philip Baker Hall (""People Like Us"") Dr Bowman originated this spelling bee and is proud that this will be it's first year on national television.

I did NOT like the dirty tricks played on other contestants, nor did I like our hero's lack of redemption, but I laughed long and hard at the most outrageous spelling bee finale I have ever seen!
