8626236,4,B00GQMGRJE,"After the viral zombie apocalypse, things get under control. There are degrees of zombies depending on how much virus they possess. Mr. Teramoto purchases a zombie as a domestic, against the town ordinance. He claims he is just holding it for a friend. Our Miss Zombie scrubs the patio in a very repetitious manner that accomplishes very little.

The zombie lives across town. On her way home she is taunted, stabbed, and has rocks thrown at her as trudges home to eat her raw fruit and vegetables, a diet that keeps zombies docile and from becoming feral meat cravers. The film sets up for a theme/metaphor as our zombie also becomes used sexually reminding me of ""The Woman.""

The movie is mostly in black and white until they leave Kansas or whatever and why they switched to color for the last few minutes, I don't know. It is in Japanese with subscripts. It doesn't have the humor of ""Fido"" and felt like I was watching a Japanese David Lynch. I will admit, I didn't fully understand the message, assuming there was one.

This is a film clearly not for everyone...maybe for those who like an art indie with a little bit zombie. Those looking for good old fashion zombie horror violence, need to keep looking.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, or nudity. Implied sex.

Note to self: 8 inch adjustable wrench is no good during a zombie apocalypse.",1392854400,3,1345,4.658227848101266
