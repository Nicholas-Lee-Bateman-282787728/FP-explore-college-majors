8052296,1,B0007VW2A8,"First, a disclosure: a hummingbird DVD that I produced is available on Amazon.com.  There are other fine hummer DVDs out there.  I urge readers of this review to check them out.

""So You Like To Watch Hummingbirds"" is atrocious -- by far the worst production of its kind (or any kind) I've ever seen, and I've seen just about every hummer production ever sold in the US.

The images repeatedly move grossly out of focus and stay that way.  This sometimes is because they are shot through a window screen and other times because of camera operator error.  The hummers may be sitting still on a perch, but because the camera is hand-held (even for extreme close-ups), the birds often careen all over the TV screen.

Sometimes, the images inexplicably sway back and forth.  On many occasions, the camera zooms in and out while the cameraperson attempts to achieve the framing and focus she wants.  Images often are so badly backlit that only the profile of the bird can be seen.  Over-exposure is a frequent problem, too.

Every so often, a falcon, hawk or other bird is thrown into the mix.  One is left to wonder why.  In fact, it is impossible to find any useful organization to this thing at all - with the possible exception of the section on caring for hummingbird feeders.  Charitably speaking, her discussion of feeders rises to the level of amateur.

As for the audio: The music used for the unnamed, irrelevant chapter lists is fine in terms of the audio levels and the selection itself.  Once one selects a chapter, the audio levels drop dramatically.  When one returns to the menu from one of the scenes, one is sound-blasted by the much higher audio levels.

Often, however, there is no sound at all.  No music, no narration, no hummers singing, nothing.  That would be OK, if it somehow worked with the images.  But incompetence - not art - explains these contretemps.  The narrator's voice is not unpleasant, but she delivers little useful information and is often vague when doling out facts.

The image and sound editing would be laughable were they not slaps in the faces of customers and professionals alike.  The so-called producer has about as much professional competence at cutting, transitioning, etc. as she does at photography: none.  Take the jump cuts, where we move from one visual perspective to another.  Between many of them we view fragments of scenes that apparently were discarded in the production process.  Etc., etc.

Unless they are collectors of America's worst home videos, customers will be sorely disappointed. Anyone who buys this DVD without having purchased one made by another independent producer would have to wonder if all us are this bad.  It is a disservice to the customer and to the rest of us who care deeply about quality and value.  It's not the competition from this DVD that I fear.  This production sullies the reputation of every independent nature video producer as it rips off the unsuspecting customer.  Caveat emptor!",1135296000,,2979,4.814595660749507
