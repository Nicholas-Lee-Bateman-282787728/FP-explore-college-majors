1189350,1,B0000060X7,"I'm a lifelong Batman fan and let me say this movie makes me mad. It's not even close to be accurate by any means to the DC comic book character. The trailers for this movie have looked horrible.
In the comic book Salena Kyle is a depressed secretary. She hates herself and has no confidence. She ends up striking back at the people who hurt her and calls herself Catwoman because she loves cats. She has her cat Isces and thats the only friend she has had. She has no special powers.
The trailers from the movie make this look like a completely different character. Halle Berry has the lead role as Catwoman. This is a miscast. She's not white and blonde. Wild Wild West has shown that you can't change a major characters race and have it work no matter how popular the actor or actress is. In the trailers I've seen and promos I've read Paitience(they couldn't even keep her real name) in the movie gets involved in a conspiracy in the cosmetic company she works for. After a freak accident she is turned into a catwoman. She has the instincts, strength, and agility of a cat. She then stars using her newfound powers to commit crime which could cost her relationship with detective Tom Lone(Benjamin Bratt).
The trailers remind me of Daredevil in the way that Catwoman uses her senses which is stupid. The outfits that Catwoman wear in the movie look stupid as well. (...) .
This movie just looks like it belongs in the litter box. It's not accurate at all and it looks bad. They are going to run it into the ground with advertising and it's going to fail. This moive really does remind me of Wild Wild West in that it's going to make some money, but in the end we are all going to wonder why we wasted our time with it.",1085011200,10,1723,4.370716510903427
1189351,1,B0000060X7,"Missing her from Batman Returns (1992) I was initially delighted to hear that the Catwoman was being revived for her own big screen project. This character did not recieve her due in the original theatrical release.
Until I saw previews for this abomination of a film.
Since Eartha Kitt played Catwoman for a stint in the Adam West-era Batman, I am not bothered by the ethnicity of the character. I am concerned about the apparent 360 of the plot.
Selina Kyle is supposed to be a lowly executive assistant who eventually snaps and fights back. Nothing I have seen indicates the production crew is reasonably going to live up to the earlier release. It honestly looks like Charmed with fur and a tail.
Halle Berry is a good actress, but I must wonder what made her sign on to this train wreck in waiting. Not even her star power will be able to bail out this disaster.",1081468800,8,867,4.528662420382165

1189353,1,B0000060X7,"Why is Catwoman a disappointment? Let's put things in perspective from a creative standpoint. Costing over $145 million dollars, this film based on one of DC comics' most popular characters has Halle Berry in the lead role wearing tight black leather fighting Sharon Stone. With all those elements in place you'd expect a top-notch film and not this poorly made disaster hated by comic fans and moviegoers worldwide.

The primary reason this film is so bad is the screenplay. It took three writers to write this script and none of them earned the six figure salaries they probably got each for writing this dreck. The dialogue throughout the film is a bunch of clichs and campy puns. The story comes together through a series of convenient coincidences, a Deus Ex Machina, and worst of all the movie starts with a flashback. These are several critical mistakes first-time screenwriters make, when trained professionals with credits under their belt continue to make the same errors it's just embarrassing. These three guys need to go back to school; they don't know anything about writing at all.

Instead of adapting the great DC comic book character Selina Kyle and Gotham City, The plot revolves around Patience Phillips, a mousy Lake City resident who works at Hedare Cosmetics. She stumbles on the secret of Beau-line face cream and is killed by her boss. Left for dead, she's licked by a magical Egyptian Mau cat, becomes Catwoman, and goes out to seek revenge on her killers at the Hedare Corporation. Wearing a dominatrix outfit, this Catwoman is supposed to be the symbol of ""21st Century"" female empowerment; ironically the way she dresses and acts in this film Catwoman sets women back about five or six hundred years. After a series of incredibly stupid coincidences Detective Tom Lone (Inspector Gadget is smarter than this moron) figures out Patience the woman he's been dating is Catwoman and locks her up. But she escapes and has a yawner of a fight with Laurel Hedare now sporting Stone hard skin from the face cream she's been using. Catwoman lives to fight another day, but chances are she won't be using those nine lives in a sequel.

First time French director Pitof's inept direction combined with the terrible script makes this film impossible to watch. His camerawork is fine for a fast paced music video or commercial, but not for a movie. The quick cutting camera moves so fast that you don't get a chance to see the story he's trying to tell. Worse, he cuts and pastes scenes from Spider-man, Dark Angel, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Batman, and Smallville into his movie. I wanted to see some originality to his visuals instead of plagiarizing someone else's pictures to tell the story of Catwoman. Some advice to Pitof: First learn that movies are a visual medium where you tell an original story with pictures. Learn to master the craft then you can call yourself a pretentious one-word name.

Production values for this film are terrible when you take into account the $145 million budget. Most of the money must have gone to salaries. The sets look like a cheesy TV cop show, and the costumes look like they came out of the Salvation Army dumpster. The CGI looks like that from a Playstation 1 console and the stunt work is bland. Berry can't work the whip at all; her movements show no confidence whatsoever.

Halle Berry is gives the worst performance of her career. (SEE B.A.P.S for the now second worst.) She is awful as Patience, and horrid as Catwoman. Her big mistake was trying to copy Ertha Kitt's campy performance and not making the characters her own. Worse, she portrays Catwoman and Patience as one character; that's a big mistake. Actors must approach Superhero characters as two separate roles. Michelle Pfeiffer saw Catwoman and Selina as two distinct characters, that's what made her performance so unforgettable. Michael Keaton, Willem Dafoe and Tobey Maguire did this as well and gave amazing performances. Benjamin Bratt could have put a cardboard cut out with a cell phone taped to it in most of his scenes, his performance is stiff and uninspired. Worse, he and Berry have NO chemistry. Sharon Stone shows us she hasn't grown as an actress; She's still playing everything like it's Basic Instinct. Sad. Alex Borstien isn't comic relief. She needs to stay on Family Guy. That's all I have to say. This Catwoman is kitty litter. Avoid it at all costs.",1075420800,2,4401,4.847074468085107

1189365,2,B0000060X7,"Everyone talks about how bad this movie is. I had to see it for myself to make my own judgment. Was it that terrible? Well, no, not really. Terrible is when you cannot finish a film and I watched all of this. I guess my main problem with the movie is that someone was scissor-happy in the editing room. None of these poor actors could say one complete sentence without it involving five cuts. I doubt any camera shot lasted longer than three seconds. It's the slap happy editing I blame for a funny continuity problem. At the very beginning of the movie we're introduced to Halle Berry's character at her workplace. Then there's a night scene with Halle at home (in her huge New York apartment which all struggling artists can afford, ya know.) Then we're back at the office where everyone - not just Halle - is wearing the exact same clothes they were wearing the ""day"" before. I could continue to nitpick but I'd better wrap things up. In the end Catwoman wasn't so bad, nor was it so bad it's good. It would normally be a forgettable film but thanks to it's bad reputation is still talked about.",1496534400,,1098,4.4405940594059405

1189377,4,B0000060X7,"Contrary to what the critics say, Catwoman (2004) starring Halle Berry and  Sharon Stone is NOT a bad
movie.

The movie begins with Halle Berry's death.  But she is soon reborn with the amazing occult powers of the
Catwoman.

One of the most moving scenes occurs when an older woman named ""Ophelia Powers"" (actress Frances Conroy),
a former college professor, explains the occult Catwoman lore to Berry.  There's an eerie supernatural quality
permeating that great scene.  Shout out to the cast and production team!!

Berry plays a very sexy intriguing Catwoman whose dangerous occult powers are *usually* used to fight crime.
Lol.  Sharon Stone plays a tough smart deadly business mogul --in a performance so amazing that I didn't even
recognize Stone the first two or three times that I watched this movie!!  This is a Sharon Stone that you've never
seen!!

In the movie, Stone also exudes an effortless and seemingly inadvertent sex appeal that's so potent that it
occasionally eclipses the sex appeal of Halle Berry (who's nearly 10 years younger)  --and that's very hard to do !!
Lol.

As I recall, there are also several other strong performances.  E.g., Lambert Wilson gives a very memorable
performance as Stone's treacherous business partner and cheating spouse.

A few parts of  the movie are frustratingly slow or corny.  Despite that, it's definitely worth watching.

Probably on sale.  Worth adding to your collection.

Beyond that, the movie is worse than a Scooby Doo cartoon.

So many things are wrong
* Details like mid-level designers working directly with a CEO (never happens)
* Core writing is terrible (the professor's lesson/soliloquy is as goofy as it is poorly acted)
* Story pacing and editing (transitions are unbelievable)
* Horrible CGI (Berry hopping around is simply bad animation)

Batman Begins has 140 minutes. Catwoman has 104. Why? Batman had someone good write the story, someone good direct it, and someone good produce it. Catwoman... didn't. It seems 36 minutes of explaining the plot and developing characters was taken out.

In 2004, when Catwoman first came out, Marvel gave us The Punisher. DC gives us leather and whips in this SM-level movie. Know where I'm going with this? The Punisher is complex. You might think he goes too far but you understand why he is doing it. Argue as you like about DC and Marvel comic books, but cinematically, overall, Marvel is kicking DC to the curb.

If you want some Halle Berry eye candy, go see The Flintstones. It isn't especially good, but it never pretends to be. It is fun. Catwoman isn't.

1189402,3,B0000060X7,"Alright, let start out by being clear  this is NOT a movie about Selina Kyle, the anti-hero thief who is sometimes the adversary of Batman, and sometimes his lover.

This is the story of Patience Phillips (played by Halle Berry), who is murdered and then brought back to life by an Egyptian Mau cat. While trying to come to grips with her new powers, Patience sets out to find out why she was murdered. It turns out that the new beauty product being rolled out by the company that she used to work for is dangerous, and they did not want Patience getting in their way. Now, it is up to Catwoman to stop the corporation and save the women.

OK, this movie flopped, and it is easy to see why. First lets talk about the up-side of the movie, and its name is Halle Berry. She does a great job of carrying the dual role of Patience Phillips (submissive and eager to please) and Catwoman (sexy and determined and thoroughly independent).

The down-side of the movie is just about everything else. First of all, the first half-hour of the movie is painfully boring as you wait for something to happen. Secondly, the villain of the piece would best be described as Supermodel Woman, who uses a makeup that makes her skin as hard as marble and makes her numb and as such immune to pain  sheesh! And thirdly, the CGI used is terrible. The 1978 Superman movie boasted that, You'll believe a man can fly. Well, no one watching Catwomen run around the walls at 60 miles per hour in this film would ever believe that it was a real woman.

Plus any movie with Sharon stone is a good movie, her part in this movie is great, I love how you can see her passion and anger, she plays any part so easy.

This movie was in limbo for years, originally Michelle Pfeiffer was going to do it as a spinoff from 'Batman Returns', with Tim Burton directing, but that never happened and many years went by. When I first heard Halle Berry was cast as Catwoman, I thought, yes, perfect casting! She may bump Pfeiffer off as best Catwoman of all time! Nope, how wrong I was...Poor acting, poor script, terrible CGI, poor score/soundtrack, bad costume (was she a stripper?) and the cinematography was awful! (My friend watched it and she literally got sick from the editing done during the fight sequences, a blurred mess). And its not even the Catwoman from the comics, a completely new character named Patience Phillips (Catwoman's name is Selina Kyle). They had the nerve to have a picture of Pfeiffer's Catwoman in one scene (so apparently there have been multiple Catwomen through the ages inheriting the ""power"" when they have been chosen by cats). The movie is pretty much unwatchable, not fun nor entertaining. Not Halle Berry's fault, but she shouldn't have taken the job when she read the script, pretty much just for the money. I highly do NOT recommend this film, worse than 'Batman and Robin.'",1428537600,,1259,4.833333333333333

1189472,2,B0000060X7,"Patience Phillips overhears news of the terrible side effects of a skin cream that is being manufactured by the company she works for, Hedare Beauty, and is quickly silenced--fatally--for her eavesdropping. However, she comes back from the dead thanks to an Egyptian Mau cat and discovers she has cat-like abilities. Disguising herself as Catwoman, Patience seeks to learn the truth behind her own death.

Do you have any idea how excited I was when I heard they were making a Catwoman movie? I mean, it could be the greatest cat-burglar movie of all time loaded with super slick espionage, martial arts, sneaking around, Batman mythos references and/or cameos, strong-female-led action, cool costume(s) and more.

And then they made the movie they did.

Almost wish I could make this whole review two words--""no comment""--but that'd be cheating you guys.

This movie was not a Catwoman movie. I just don't understand what they were trying to do here. Had this been a fan film and some attempted new take on the character, okay, fine, whatever, put it online and let people decide, but this was supposed to be the real deal. She wasn't even called Selina Kyle in this. Instead, she was ""Patience Phillips."" They tried to jazz up what is supposed to be a very down-to-earth origin and give it a mythology of its own. Okay, points for trying something new and superhero or supervillain origins are often tweaked or changed for the big screen. What makes Catwoman as a character awesome is the fact that she's human, like Batman, and is basically his opposite. Not so in this one. She's got cat-powers and while it was visually cool to watch her jump around and scale buildings and stuff, it's just not who she is.

Halle Berry playing Catwoman is just fine. She's sleek, sexy and pulls off the part. The problem is the story is not very good, the costume is terrible--how slinky and impractical can you get?--and there's really nothing in this that ties it into the Batman universe. This is supposed to be a spin-off, but even spin-offs have a connection to the main source. i.e. the Elektra spin-off movie from Daredevil. Regardless of how you feel about that one, it's still a spin-off and is known as such.

This was definitely a comic book movie in that they went for ""comic booky"" as the feel of it. Felt more direct-to-video to me, seemed rushed and just fell flat.

Catwoman is an awesome character and was resurrected in The Dark Knight Rises in a much more real world way. I hope that someday--hopefully sooner rather than later--another Catwoman flick is made and they really try to get it right. It has huge potential. Sadly, it was missed with this version here.",1422144000,,2672,4.758099352051836

1189476,2,B0000060X7,"This movie was just bad.  The script was stupid, the costume was not like any Catwoman costume I've ever seen in the comics.  The concept made no sense at all.  I mean if this make-up makes your skin as hard as marble, then instead of making it into make-up, why not market it to the military instead of a cosmetic line?  I'm sure they would have a use for it!

And this super smart former professor says the reason she didn't get tenure and no one believed her ""Catwoman"" theory was because of ""male academia.""  Ummm... nooo... it's because that idea is just idiotic and they probably didn't want someone thinking that this stuff was true on their staff and associated with their university!

Another thing that I find stupid about this movie is that when Patience is slipping out of the jail cell by going through the bars, one of them moves and it's obvious that it's made out of rubber or plastic.  Like 60% of this movie is CGI but they couldn't take some of their budget and CGI the bar into not moving to make it look realistic?

Look, Halle Berry did the best she did with the material she was given.  Her acting is good and that's why this get 2 stars instead of just 1.",1420934400,,1179,4.318181818181818

Catwoman (aka, Selina Kyle) has no powers, she is a skilled cat burglar whom plays on the fence of morality.  She also does not come from a ""line of chosen women"" nor have a mystical cat that brings her back to life.

It's not that kind of movie. It's a lighthearted fare. So even though it has the elements of how a woman comes into a life grander than what she had been living and deals with the struggle of choosing to do right or wrong...that's about it without the depth. While some would say not one of Halle Berry's better fares she still does a good job acting the transition needed for the main character's changing personality. Sharon Stone is perfect for her role as well (name not excluded...) and Benjamin Bratt...well, he's a good actor. If this movie lacks anything major it would be in the lacking of depth in the story but that's pretty subjective because sometimes lighter fare fits the bill.",1415145600,4,849,4.414012738853503

I give this two stars only because Halle looked great, did the best she could with this rotten script and accepted her Razzie award like a champ then gave a hilarious speech at the end of it all. The movie is garbage but Halle handled it with class and this will surely go down as one of the worst superhero movies of all time.

Honestly, after all I heard about it, I was expecting a lot worse but I actually had some good laughs but for all the wrong reasons. It doesn't quite make ""So bad it's good"" territory for me but it was almost there. If they made it any cheesier it might have been a great comedy...but alas, it's pretty much as bad as everyone says it is and more.

Halle looks fantastic and its hard to believe someone actually could mess up a script to the point that even Halle in tight black leather could not save it. The problem was not so much the acting but the ridiculous tired script, the dialogue, the storyline and pretty much everything else. The actors at least got paid for this. For the people who paid to watch it, all I can say is I am glad I saw this for free. It's a train wreck. No doubt about it.

I think with the same cast, the same costumes and a better script and better director and plot, this could have been an awesome movie. I am not sure what went wrong here other than to say it was just BLAH and predictable, silly, over-acted and forgettable. I would love to see a GOOD Catwoman movie one day but sadly I think people are not going to be too eager to give Halle another shot at this role. I think she is a great actress in the right role and she is gorgeous., this movie was just not good from the start, the script was lousy and even the best actors would never be able to make this work.",1408492800,,1894,4.209366391184573

I think she actually does really good and with MUCH better Writers and If the movie was different and better. You wouldn't see any Halle Berry hate at all. I mean think about it, do you really know anyone else who can eat cat food and hiss at dogs that much better? Overall the catwoman character was just written badly, and Berry tried to do everything she could with it. For the movie the plot is really weak at times, and some effects could have been done better then others. It's a cable/netflix movie, I wouldn't spend any money on it. 2.9/5 stars I just can't go 3 with all the problems. Halle Berry can't save this ship. It's not horrible but it's not good.

1189529,1,B0000060X7,"Alright, so if you saw the title, then do your self a favor and check those expectations at the door,
because this movie is in no way shape or form the story of Selina Kyle.

No, this time around we are given a half hazard story about some other woman we've never heard of,
exhibited with bad special effects, a ludicrous story, and topped off with a ridiculous villain.

Does the movie have any redeemable features? On screen, absolutely not, but it's history is certainly worth a look.

The history of this film is the most interesting aspect, hands down.
It was written, re-written, cast, re-casted, and even the director and film companies changed several times.

Now, if you'd like to know how I think they should've done this movie, it can be summed up in four simple steps

1. Go to a comic shop and buy the Catwoman Origin Story
2. Get permission for content usage from the publisher and copyright owner
3. Use the original story and keep it accurate to the lore
4. Put it on film

They could have even tied it to Batman Returns if they had wanted to, the opening shot of this movie could've been
Selina Kyle after landing int he alley and getting surrounded by Cat's, she delivers a monologue about the next few days,
she fakes her death (the climax of Batman Returns), and then we could've picked up with the final shot where we see her
on one of the rooftops in Gotham City.

And Voila! We would've had a great movie, or at least a decent movie at that.

In retrospect, I think audiences would have had a better time watching a couple episodes from Batman: The Animated Series.

Now on principal, I can't give this movie a completely negative rating out of respect for everything it went through,
so for the bottom line i'll say it's a 4%- Badly Edited, Ludicrous in most areas, and un-true to it's comic book source material,
Catwoman fails to deliver the riveting story of arguably the greatest female anti-hero in the respectable DC universe.",1394323200,,1956,4.534090909090909

1189541,2,B0000060X7,"What a horrible, sad little film. I was excited about Catwoman for several reasons: I like Batman, Spiderman, X-Men, and those other super-people stories; I have a cat; AND...Halle Berry [well, I don't have her, but you know what I mean..]. As it turned out, however, the only thing redeemable about this flick was Berry's bod in her outfit, hence the bonus star. Everything else was miserable and warranted the most dismal 1-star ranking.

So what's the problem, you ask? Character development was atrocious. Berry's character dies near the beginning, and I didn't even care. There's no reason to! We only just met her, and her demise is handed to her in such a way as to be completely unrelateable to normal people's experiences. At least batman experienced a mugging gone horribly wrong, spiderman had his crush as did superman, and the X-men/people experienced xenophobia and were a statement about humankind's treatment of the Other.

But Catwoman? Vacuous. She dies a lame death, and is magically given life again and powers by some cartoonish cat's stank fish breath. The subsequent stunt work is awful, and the editors tried to conceal this fact with rapid-fire images lasting less than a second from a dozen different angles, leaving your head spinning. Utterly unimpressed. With batman and superman, we see the develop of a costume from personal parts of their life--it's a process--THAT is character development. With Catwoman, she puts on some leather bit from her closet that was foreshadowed at the beginning. Big deal. She flirts with some cop dude, but there's no romance there, nothing trying to keep them apart that they have to fight for, and in the end the relationship is all but forgotten, so why should we care about her or them as a couple? We shouldn't, and don't.

Lastly, all the best superhero-type stories are fighting for something big. Something noble. Sometimes that thing is external, sometimes it's an internal struggle, and other times it's a smart mix of both (X-Men). What is the focus of Catwoman's battle? Addictive makeup/skincare-products that put ONE person in the hospital briefly. BFD.

Holy smokes, right?), and the dead-end relationship with the cop, and not enough focus on the cat lady and Midnight, and how those two influenced the birth and maturation of Catwoman.

The best scene in the whole film is the one where she plays basketball with the cop, and that says a lot about why this film really doesn't work at all. I mean, what did a little one-on-one have to do with why Catwoman does what she does and is who she is?

And that note at the end? Come on! What a waste of breath and time THAT was for this film. Cliched, hackneyed, call it what you will, it was terrible. I know these screenwriters get paid a royal MINT to write these movies -- what happened? Did they get tired? Did they let the intern take a shot? What?

I found it funny, in a ""not funny ha-ha"" way, that so many people were put off by Halle's character, in both her incarnations. Yes, she was mousy and timid before she became Catwoman. So? She found her power, and used it to do good things, to get back at the people who killed her. Gosh, wish I had found MY power like that! It's camp, in a very good way. I have to think that those who didn't like it because it wasn't ""comic book"" just really need to stand back and take a look at their comic obsession . . . maybe it is time to move out of mom's basement and get a real life.

  Catwoman is not some ridiculous super-powered vigilante who looks better out of costume than in it and is followed around by DJ scratches and hip-hop soundtracks like in this movie.

Halle Berry gives a lukewarm performance as the title character, taking her co-stars along for the ride. In fact, the only person in the film that makes her character watchable is Sharon Stone, and that's only because she appeared to have fun chewing the scenery!

1189656,4,B0000060X7,"Well guys, let's first start off with this before we go on. Catwoman isn't supposed to be high art, a deep movie, or have incredible acting. All it is, plain and simple, is a hero-action movie that's actually pretty fun to watch if you don't take it too seriously. Think of it as a comic book in motion. Once you get the idea, everything is pretty fun. If you can't get past this concept, you need to lighten up, lol.

The main gripe I have about this movie is the horrible soundtrack and music. The composer should be shot because he/she doesn't know how to score the music with the scenes. About 90 percent of the music track is cheesy hip-hop/rap that doesn't fit. It's loud, dumb, and a 10-year old music student could have done a lot better. There's no connection with what's going on in the movie and the music. If anything, the composer, if you can call him/her that, just took advantage of the opportunity to try to get his/her tunes onto the big screen.

So let me rap you my opinion of the music. (fade in scratch beat....)

Hey homey
it's baloney
the tunes ain't worth a rip.
But Berry
she's a cherry,
and I ain't talking *bleep*

The composer
he's a loser.
He can't write tunes
to save his life.
His music
isn't music
It's just noise

However, the other day I bought it for a quarter because sometimes when movies are so bad they become enjoyable just to laugh at. I hadn't seen it since the time at the theater but I figured for a quarter I couldn't really go wrong. Somehow now though, I still feel cheated.

What can be said that hasn't been said before? This garbage which posed as a DC Comics movie is, as you've heard hundreds of times, nothing at all like actual Catwoman. The only matching point is the name. However, knowing that and going in a second time to watch it as a stand alone superhero movie it still falls flat on its face. Halle Barry is at her worst as she awkwardly struts around in some trashy torn up clothes and whips around a mostly CGI whip. The effects in this movie are playstation 1 if not worse level graphics and the plotline, written by three people, is worse than most that you would find on the Scyfy channel.

There are absolutely no redeeming qualities in this movie; it isn't even a good one to make fun of with friends. The jokes that you could make would be too easy and after a while it'd be like beating a dead horse.

1189719,1,B0000060X7,"When I first learned of the movie Catwoman, I heard that the public reception towards the first trailers - where Halle Berry, who plays the main character, hisses at some barking dogs - were so bad that Warner studios had to release new trailers without this scene that made moviegoers laugh. Now I am not sure if everybody who saw those trailers did laugh, but I am certain that everyone knew that the movie would have a rough ride at its release. Especially when they had to reshoot a whole new ending for the pre-screening reactions were bad. However, the end result was that the public, the critics, and certain actors like Halle Berry herself, admitted the movie was awful.

At the time of the release many critics have been thrown at Pitof, the movie director, and have blamed him for the film's failure. However, I think that movie's main mistake was that it was caught in a Development Hell that went for twelve years, in which the project switched writers so many times that the original story, a sequel to Batman Returns ending that Daniel Waters wrote, became something else. And by that I mean a derivative story where an intimidated graphic designer working for two unpleasant Cosmetic company bosses, drown and become a woman-cat entity who takes the identity of Catwoman while wearing a costume that made her more ridiculous than dangerous.

About the actors, I can say that everyone in the cast gave their best with what they got, but I wonder if they all knew, and the director to an extent, that the movie would flop at its release. Especially with a script that has awful one-liners, funny scenes at moments when it shouldn't be so, and a more or less ridiculous villain in the form of a Cosmetic Company. As such, the movie follows some of the same origins that Michelle Pfeiffer had in Batman Returns, but does it in a more ridiculous way that one wonders what would have happened if the movie had been done with Daniel Waters' original script.

About the director, of which I saw his first feature Vidocq, it was evident that he is more at ease working through visual effects and camera shots since this is where he first started his movie career, such as some of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's works. There are some nice shots that I liked such as the accelerated day workday in the artists' office as we see Halle Berry coworkers leaving while she finishes her artwork late at night. But in general, it was too easy to see when the computerized version of Halle Berry did her stunts and when the real actress was on set. During this movie experience, I had the feeling that the production was rushed and it hurt the movie's effects. Not only that, Pitof has the annoying habit of switching angles every three seconds, and that becomes a headache to watch even on a small TV screen. So imagine the people that had to watch it in a movie theater's giant screen. Maybe that was one of the reasons why they had to cancel all the IMAX release they intended to do in 3D, apart from a probably rushed post-production schedule.

Of the soundtrack, I found it very irritating as it tried to make itself cool, but instead made me laugh for the wrong reasons, at scenes that could have been more dramatic such as Catwoman's rebirth, her final fight with her boss's wife, and her first costume dress-up as she puts herself some makeup and cuts her hair everywhere. And with the way she does it, it's a wonder she didn't cut her ears or gouged her eyes.

In the end, I think this movie experience hurt the character's chance of success in any movie done without Batman's presence, and the only way it could have been saved was if the artists involved had done their movie with a better script.",1352073600,2,3694,4.574018126888218

1189724,1,B0000060X7,"So a young woman named Patience Philips (Halle Berry, ""Monster's Ball"") is working for a cosmetic company and doesn't lead a very interesting life in all honestly. Well one night she overhears something she shouldn't where her boss (Sharon Stone, ""Basic Instinct"") is talking about how she doesn't care about the effects her products have on society cause she's making tons of money off of the suckers who buy them. Apparently people get sick and or just die after they stop using said products, well after Patience is discovered having heard this she is promptly disposed of but doesn't die thanks to a bunch of cats who save her.

Thus Catwoman is born, well after some scenes of Patience not wanting to accept what has happened to her, but she does quickly realize she is totally different and a better person for it. She falls for a cop (Benjamin Bratt, TV's ""Law & Order"") who is on the trail of the deaths of women who have used these make-up products and she tempts him to fall for her by playing a game basketball while some hip-hop song plays (totally silly scene mind you).

The action is quite ridiculous, the writing is well just horrid and any of the big name stars are totally mis-used here, Stone seems to really phone it in especially in the final few scenes when it comes to her line delivery.

1189727,1,B0000060X7,"I had never seen this movie until recently, and not because of lack of desire. I love comic book movies, and I generally jump to get the chance to see one. Catwoman, however, gained a bad rap early, and that was enough to keep me away. Folks that hated it loathed it, and well, I didn't know anyone who didn't hate it. Kinda killed it for me, so I went on with my life...

It's been years now. I figured, why not watch it, how bad can it be? I mean, it does have Halle Berry in it, and she looks great. I was dying to see how she interpreted one of the great likeable villains in comic book history.

Well, it turns out, this movie is as bad as they say, and has no real redeemable qualities.

#1 This is no comic. This movie has nothing to do with the comics, except the name of the movie, and the fact that she is a somewhat catlike woman. After watching this, I am sure the comics are greatful that this is an anomaly.
#2 Halle Berry is awful. Her alter ego is unlikable, which ruins the whole movie. She dresses laughably bad, and her personality is transparently fake. How can you develop interest in a movie where you can find no one to root for, no one you want to follow?
#3 The plot. The plot is ridiculous, where you can have a graphic artist break into a closed research facility after hours by entering a ""back door""? Having a cat ""test"" you by seeing if you will climb out a window in a multistory building and ""save"" them, even though they can get down on their own...is that a test of compassion, or stupidity? Having a person come back from the dead because they are deemed worthy by a cat? Like how did they know she would die? Why did they test her, if they didn't know she would die? How many deaths each year are caused by a deluge of industrial waste from a top secret cosmetic research lab? I could go on, but I will stop right there...
#4 The special affects aren't very special at all. Catwoman jumps from second story ballustrade to second story ballustrade somehow evading the poorly aimed bullets shot by police officers. Evidently the policmen in this town were not trained to ""lead a target"" and shoot ahead of a moving target. They shoot direct at a moving target and miss every time, and then have the gall to look shocked.

Halle did look gorgeous, for sure she's one of the loveliest women in H-Wood, but B. Bratt is absolutely awful. I don't like him anyhow. Sharon Stone is Sharon Stone & there's nothing to be done about that.

1189731,4,B0000060X7,"Catwoman is the most underrated film I have ever seen. I can't believe so many people think its bad. Has anyone seen Green Lantern this year? That was bad. This is a very different Catwoman that's been seen before. Halle Berry does what she can with a lack luster script but all and all, she's a decent Catwoman. Sharon Stone plays a great villain too. Her scenes with Berry are very good. The rest of the cast is okay. Benjamin Bratt is not in the same acting category as Halle Berry. He is a bore to watch. All I can say about the Catwoman costume is that it is unique. I have never seen nothing like it. However, it grew on me. Catwoman is a very connect the dots kind of movie. There is nothing special about it, other than it features Catwoman. If you're a fan of the character or like campy movies, check Catwoman out.

There are a couple special features that you will find on the Blu-Ray disk. However, most of them are on the standard DVD. You will not find the theatrical trailer or the animated feature Chase Me on the standard DVD. The best special feature on the disk is The Many Faces of Catwoman Documentary hosted by the late Eartha Kitt. It includes interviews with Julie Newmar, Lee Meriwether,  Eartha Kitt, Michelle Pfeiffer (The best Catwoman) and Halle Berry.

Once you get past that this is in no way like the iconic ""Catwoman"" you know, you'll love it for what it is. You'll be laughing and shaking your head at how ridiculous it is. It's a very unique and different take on Catwoman. This story is more a Peter Parker scenario of a meek artist, who stumbles onto a secret at her job, she's chased by the bad lackeys and dies, but a cat kisses her and breathes life back into her, and she returns to get revenge on those that killed her, etc, etc. Corny as hell? Yes! Unbelievable? Yes! Entertaining? Yes! This is one of those so-bad-it's-good movies.
In the first few scenes of Halle as Catwoman I cringed: her acting came off very fake and trying too hard. But after a few more scenes of her purring one liners, I completely loved the way she acted. This is a very camp movie, with even a black singer belting out while Halle struts her stuff. Benjamin Bratt is adequate as the cop who falls for Berry (why is he always a cop? He also played one in that movie I like, Abandon) and is sweet eye candy, as usual. Sharon Stone is below adequate and doesn't play her role with much interest, which is understandable. I almost felt like she was snickering at the silliness of the movie. Should also mention that Halle is stunning with the long, curly hair; didn't like how she looked with the choppy hair.

That is not to say this is a bad movie.  It is okay.  As far as acting goes, I believe Halle Berry did a phenonmenal job.  The script is decent and the plot is fine.

Unfortunately, the direction and special effects is where the movie falls apart.  Feels like they watched Spiderman right before they decided to do the special effects.  They should have watched the Dark Knight instead.

1189745,2,B0000060X7,"""Catwoman"" is so repulsive, it made anime catgirls who watched it hack up feces and throw the content at a hero's face, and then have him scratched into pieces.  It's a amalgamation of Warner Bros' heinously-produced superhero movies of the past, thinly-disguised as an empowering chick flick.  Not to mention the public attention of having one of the worst superhero costumes ever, but to be fair, despite looking like a dominatrix mouse with clothes taken from a thrift store,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/at-least-she-didn-t-wear-those-ugly-goggles/dp/1563899086/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">at least she didn't wear those ugly goggles</a>.  It's kind sad that such attention goes for such a wear, because she actually work a decent 'prototype' costume before her official wardrobe disaster: it was a tight leather pants (unshredded) and a long-sleeve jacket followed by black mask; she looked presentable, and she didn't seem less agile wearing more clothes than she does wearing less.  If she just cover her head with a bandana (and wearing cat ears), that would've been the right costume for her, but no, she wanted to look like a laughingstock to even perverts.

It's about a not-Selena Kyle named Patience (Berry), a weedy design for ads in a big make-up business owned by a rich jerk and her wife, the latter played by a not-looking-good-in-her-older-years Sharon Stone.  When Patience was about to fall from her apartment after saving a mysterious cat, she was rescued by detective named Rico Suave---that's not his actual name, but Benjamin Bratt played a character who did nothing but coming on to the lead actress, so that name is appropriate.  Later, Patience went into a make-up facility when she overheard that her company's new product is tainted and dangerous for anyone who tried it; she was killed as a result.  And then came the stupidest plot-device happened: the same mysterious cat walk on her corpse, YAWNED AT HER FACE, and not only did it revived her, it gave her acute senses and extreme agility.  But such dexterity comes as a price when she has to carry all of the quirks of a cat; walking on thin ledges on her own two feet, having an obsessive craving for fish, having dogs bark at her, and having a fear of rain.  Oh, and she can teleport from one place to another, though that sounds more like a magician that a cat's ability.

I wish I didn't make this sound stupid, but it really is.  What's next, does she bath herself with her tongue and does she breed 3 litters after 3 months?  Not even a few comics I read and some cartoons I've seen painted ""Catwoman"" in such a literal manner.  The stupidity didn't help but how warped the film is directed.  It seems like Pitof, the film's director, has see the first ""Spider-Man"" and wanted to imitate its free-flowing camera angles.  Except he wanted to use more of that style, whether it be backgrounds shots, interiors, character POVs, third-person perspective, wherever it can move around. This approach to filming is so tacky and distracting, it actually makes the film look fake (especially during Catwoman jumping across buildings); half the time I thought I was watching a 3D-animated movie, except this is live-action.  Editing is another seque to nitpick.  Some of the scene edits are weird, like that one scene where the guy was taking, and the scene keeps cutting to the same character in the same position (i.e. opening scene for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cool-As-Ice/dp/6302261589/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Cool As Ice""</a>).  Sometimes, the film even has a few goofs, like when a burglar tried to break a glass class with his gun, but the glass case was smashed before his gun even made impact; it's a notable goof, and it's been done twice!

Halle Berry tried to do something with her character, but she was totally boned.  She made horrible puns, her assertive attitude is laughable, and she did nothing to make Catwoman act sexual as well as appear sexual; she can be even too enamored with herself, like when her superego is dancing around on the center of a club stage and is lashing her whip around.  The story was stupid, the acting was weak, and fights are meandering.  ""Catwoman"" failed to be a provocative movie as well as being popcorn entertainment.",1279670400,,4349,5.128895184135978

Halle Berry takes Catwoman to a whole new level. She studied cats so much that in the movie you believe that she is a Cat Woman! She plays it so realistically, if I can say that and make sense. She moves just like I've watched my cats. They own the world, don't take commands unless they want to and are sweet and playful when they are in the mood.
Ms. Berry puts a LOT of sensuality into her version that it looks like there has never been another. Of course, you have to remember that, not only is this a movie, or a TV show, but that this is a much later time in cinema than they were allowed to do even in movies. With that liberty, Berry takes it to the limit and past it!

I know that Catwoman was a villain in the Batman comics and movies, but this was a new version for a new generation. Berry plays Patience Phillips, who is a shy artist working for a cosmetics company. While she is delivering a new design to her boss, she overhears a plot to sell defective beauty products that will make your skin decay. She is murdered and reborn after a cat with supernatural abilities breathes new life inside her. Soon, Patience slowly transforms into Catwoman, and tries to bring her killer to justice.

1. Halle Berry looks good in a tight cat suit.
2. Lambert Wilson gets to play a snooty and unscrupulous executive...which is a bit of a stretch for him, right? Right? ...oh.
3. The DVD makes a good drink coaster so you won't get rings on your coffee table.
4. If you ever get stranded at sea, the reflective DVD can be used to signal passing ships.
5. If you don't own a protractor, the DVD can be used to trace a perfect circle.
6. For the price of one penny, ""Catwoman"" is an affordable purchase in todays tough economy.
7. Too few superhero movies have any appeal to cat lovers but not THIS one.

1189758,1,B0000060X7,"Catwoman: 3 out of 10: Halle Berry isn't the first actor to squander Oscar gold (F. cough Murray cough Abraham) but I can't recall an actor doing it so quickly.

Sure Oscar winners have old films embarrassingly show up on DVD and after a few years and ex-wives they will take a paycheck role in some European schlock. But in your next movie in which you are the star?

Berry isn't awful as simply horrible miscast (lacks a certain erotic nastiness for the role.) and apparently doesn't have the acting chops to make up the difference. One must speculate how the studio felt when the first rushes came in. It sounded so good on paper and Berry is such a big star it's doubtful that any screen test was done. Now the evidence is in front of them and the enormity of the casting mistake is obvious. Was anyone in that room brave enough to admit the emperor has no clothes?

Now Berry is hardly the worst actor in the movie (Alex Borstien as the fat horny comic relief is pretty awful but the honors go to Frances Conroy as the cat lady who is so awful one wonders if she has ever had a conversation with another human.)

(On a side note it really is amazing that I list the worst actors and Benjamin Bratt doesn't make the cut. Now that is some bad acting.)

(On another even more aside note I list the worst actors and Sharon Stone doesn't make the list. Good lord somebody call Guinness)

While the movie overall is not nearly as bad as its reputation led me to believe, Catwoman still falls short.

Along with the acting there is the horrible horrible (did I mention horrible) music which sounds like a 13 year old girls idea of what is hip; a lot of silly jumping around the city scenes; and the coup de grace, the Ferris wheel scene.

Now no-one wants to see Catwoman save cherub face boy from carny ride gone bad'come to think of it no-one wants to see Batman do this either. The direction and scripting on this scene is bad' Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever bad. Between this and the main villain being a cosmetic tyrant whose anti-aging cream is faulty the lightweight plot is not doing the movie any favors.

Superhero Karma at the theater is returned. For every Dark Knight there is a Catwoman. This movie might be awful by every conceivable measurement but it helps return a cosmic balance to the universe.",1256256000,2,2307,4.422169811320755
1189759,4,B0000060X7,"Yes, I like this movie.
No point here for me to defend the story/acting as it's personal taste. But I like very much how Pitof moves the camera, mostly during wide shots where the movement is quite eerie and gives nice display of the town by night ; he also has good ideas to switch from one scene to another (ex : the broken glass in the jewelry switching to the stolen jewels on Patience's bed).

Picture quality : 4.5/5
The colors are incredibly strong for a movie mostly shot at night. They're not bleeding and look very life like. Movement (sometimes very fast) seems fluid, light to dark scenes looks natural. Some CGIs (the cat resurrecting Prudence) seem a bit awkward, but it doesn't come from the trasfer, but from the film itself (didn't recognise any other CGI so they're not that bad.
Audio quality : 3/5
I'm not impressed by the audio quality, of course no explosions, roars of motors, elaborate music so it's quite difficult to judge only everiday life sounds. They feel realistic enough, but there's not much 3D dimension to sound.

I'm not sure the tone they were trying to set... sexy was definitely one angle and Halle Berry is hot... but if they were trying to go for edgy or action packed, that was much less successful.  First, Halle Berry plays her role way too ""cute"".  Definitely the opposite of Michelle Phieffer's interpretation in the Batman movie.

I recall people saying that this Catwoman made no sense because of the origin presented.  Personally, I think the origin story here made more sense than Batman Returns did.
Think about it.  Selina Kyle in Returns and the Phillips character in this film were both found by cats after being thrown off of high distances and survive an attempt to murder them.  Returns showed Kyle going completely ballistic afterwards and taking on the characteristics of a cat because of her abuse from her employer and her downtrodden life.  This abuse and unhappy life was another thing that they had in common with each other.  But how does Kyle acquire her agility and athletic prowess?  At least this version of Catwoman gave a reason for it.

Halle Berry (what was she thinking) as Patience Phillips, the woman who stumbles onto the company's dark secret and is killed and dumped.  Magic cats find her and breathe new life into her.  And she pops out of unconsciousness like it's the most normal thing in the world.

I was expecting camp but not to this corny degree.  Nothing like the comics at all.  The Catwoman in the comics is a cat burglar, who is the nemesis and sometimes-ally with Batman.  The Sixties TV series with several campy Catwomen were so much more intelligent if aimed towards a kiddie audience.

The martial arts are a bit weak -- the cat thing is overplayed.  And the love interest is as bland as warm milk.

Avoid.

She really does behave like a cat, even though some of those scenes are really stupid.  Lastly, the Producers nailed the movie they were trying to make.

This is the problem with this movie; if you are going to make a movie called ""Catwoman"" using the DC license, then your movie must star Selina Kyle.

When I first heard about this movie I was excited to say the least, I mean Halle Berry as Catwoman who would not want to see that? So I waited to see the film wanting for it to hit theaters because up until that point every Catwoman in film, TV show, animated, and comic has been great and wonderful characters. So with that knowledge I just knew this was going to a good movie, once again Halle Berry as the Catwoman. Of course like most people I was a little disappointed with the outcome of the film and the over all finished product. I feel like this was not the movie that should have been made but at the same time this is really not a bad movie. Take away all prejudice and expectations and what you get is a fun little new take on Catwoman and a fun little movie.

The film is about a struggling over worked yet very good looking woman named Patience Philips [Berry], did I mention that she is attractive, really a beautiful woman. She is stressed out along side her friend Sally [Alex Borstein] who encourages her to find a man, it shouldn't be that hard. One day she notices a cat out on a ledge outside her apartment and decides it is up to her to save it, while on the ledge a detective is driving by a sees her on the edge. Of course he thinks she is suicidal and goes up to save her, this sets up our romantic ach of the story. One day while at work she forgets to take something to her boss so after a deliver service says they can't do it she heads to the address on her own. When she arrives at said place she hears something she should not have and is literally flushed away, she dies under water. The cat that she tried to rescue sees this and calls upon the cats of the city to help revive her, much like previous Catwomen. So the hunt is on to find her killers and bring them to justice, DC Comics style, or something.

Much like people have said about this movie I agree that there are problems with this film, key word being film, as in filmmakers. The script by Theresa Rebeck, John Brancato, Michael Ferris, and John Rogers was lagging in a major way. The first problem with it is that most of the characters seem flat and that is most likely due to the even flatter dialogue. Plus I am never one to hate on a bad story line [just check my other reviews] but for something that had a theatrical release with a big budget and stared an Academy award winning actress I kinda felt like it need more then this. For those who don't know this movie is about an evil cosmetics company that is releasing a product that will not kill you but it will mess up your face. I don't know about you but that seems like a police matter not a super hero thing, that's just me though. Also director Pitof just seems like he didn't know what to do with this movie, of course that could also fall back to the script which every director has to sign off on. Another thing that I just can't let go of is the CGI scenes of Catwoman running on the walls, don't know why but I don't like it.

Of course I did say that I kinda like this flick though right? Well the answer is yes and that is for two reasons, Halle Berry and the rest of the cast. I will start with the rest of the cast and save the best for last, so here we are. I really believe that the cast saved this movie from being a total waste with the performances they gave, which I feel were not that bad. Take into account the script they were given to read off of and then watch it; they actually pulled off some good performances. Benjamin Bratt as the cop she falls for does a good job with what he is given and same can be said for Lambert Wilson as her boss. Alex Borstein is excellent as her best friend is one of the few characters that seems to be some what three dimensional or at least very entertaining. But I have to say that Sharon Stone steals the show with a very nasty mean performance, hope that doesn't spoil it for you. Now on to one Halle Berry who can never do wrong in my eyes, at least not do a horrible job. I do have to say that I think she did a good job with what she had, she strikes me as the type that reads as written [I think I said that right]. The first half of the film when she is normal she does a brilliant job and every thing seems natural [all except that not being able to get a boy friend thing] but it is in the last half as Catwoman that the cracks start to show. Of course she does a good job and is extremely sexy as the cat, but her lines they gave her are straight horrible at time. Of course I can forgive that because she is gorgeous and probably the hottest Catwoman ever, although I can see the argument for others [when they played the character]. But over all she did a great job and looked great doing it, man she is beautiful.

Over all this actually better then most people give it credit for, even with its flaws that are many. I know I made this sound pretty bad in an earlier paragraph but with no expectations going into this and you will enjoy it. Sure it was far from a classic but so are other movies that seem to be enjoyable, this is one of those. A movie does not have to be great to be good it just has to be good enough to be entertaining.",1232928000,2,5179,4.078508341511285

Catwoman: Time to accessorize!
=======================================================

Catwoman was a box office bomb, and it also won a Razzie award for Halle Berry, which she accepted in person. The 'award' was for worst couple, shared with either of her costars--Sharon Stone or Benjamin Bratt. As much as I'd like to see Stone and Berry coupling, their hook up was more along the lines of hero and villain. Darn. Bratt, on the other hand, plays a cop who is fascinated by both Patience Philips AND Catwoman. Obviously he was cast more for his looks than his acting or ability to convincingly portray a cop. As Lance, Patience's colleague at the Beauty Products company proclaims when he pays Patience a visit:

-----------------------
Lance: Hey! Man sandwich! Twelve o'clock!
====================================

Benjamin has played similar roles in 'Miss Congeniality' with Sandra Bullock--where they were both cops and with Madonna as a yoga instructor in 'The Next Best Thing.' Bratt even won another Razzie for 'The Next Best Thing'--also for worst couple. In his defense I'd have to say that matching him with the Halle cat is not this movie's biggest problem. In fact, I have no problem whatsoever with the Bratt/Berry match.

The problem with this movie is the writing. A real stupid script that makes no sense, and fails to create a compelling vision that might have made the audience forgive its lack of sense. Catwoman might have worked as a fable, with the mysterious character of Ophelia and her cats, especially Midnight, the Egyptian Mau, as a kind of witch's familiar. 'Edward Scissorhands' certainly doesn't make sense, but in the world that Tim Burton creates, it works as a fable, and we've never metaphor we didn't like. For another instance, in Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast when the Beast kills a bird and eats it smoke comes out of the poor bird. This makes no literal sense, but in the poetic, dream like fable, it makes perfect sense. 'Catwoman' was a character out of the Batman story, but in this movie there was no attempt to tie it in. Then they make her back story, and it is a stupid one for the kind of movie it could have been. Actually, I've seen Halle in this exact same situation, but in a different movie where her character worked. 'Boomerang' had her as a graphic artist somewhat oblivious to fashion though she worked at a beauty products company. I would be feeling that deja vu, except that in 'Catwoman' that character doesn't work.

I can see what they were trying to do, Patience Philips, someone who does what she's told, suffers those of lesser talent ordering her around; until she becomes Catwoman, and is empowered. But really, the whole Beauty Products mogul as villain making the evil corporate face cream--please.

Still, Halle Berry looked great in her leather cat suit, and I think that she did a great job with what she had to work with. She threw herself into the role, and really was the feral feline the role requires.

------------------------
Catwoman: White Russian, no ice, no vodka... hold the Kahlua.
=======================================================

Perhaps French director Pitof bit off more than he could chew (sorry, with a French director pretentious enough to go by a single name the pun temptation was irresistible). I heard that he turned in a script that he wrote with another writer that took a more artistic approach, but the producers didn't think it would be commercial enough. So, let's give him the benefit of the doubt, because it seems hard to believe that his artistic approach could be any worse than the final product was.

Sharon Stone can share some of the blame for the fiasco that was 'Catwoman.' It seems like her character was supposed to make a statement about how the fashion world, and Hollywood, too, treats women once they are past a certain age:

----------------------------------
Laurel Hedare: I was everything they wanted me to be. I was never more beautiful. Never more powerful. And then I turned 40 and they threw me away.
=======================================================

But you might say that she just rested on her Laurel. Word is that her cell phone rang while filming and she took the call. Talk about phoning it in. The script didn't help; Sharon, but you could have at least made an effort.

1189774,2,B0000060X7,"This is not the worst movie in the world as some would have you believe. But in a world that has given us ""Manos: the Hands of Fate"", ""Dungeons & Dragons"" and ""Starship Troopers: Hero of the Federation"", that doesn't really say much.

I watched this movie because I have a morbid curiosity about bad movies. Particularly, figuring out where they went wrong. And the consensus here is ... pretty much everywhere.

Let's start with the story. The villain's dastardly plan revolves around marketing a facial creme that rejuvenates the skin, but, if one stops using it, has some very mean side effects. That's about it. MAKEUP! Oh no! The world will never be able to recover from that diabolical blow! Sure, the Joker (in Tim Burton's BATMAN) used personal grooming items seemingly at random to inflict mild cases of death on the unsuspecting public in his sadistic mind game to cause horror among the population of Gotham, but we're talking about a creme here that actually makes you look uglier if you stop using it! NOOOOOOO!

Okay, snark aside, I just couldn't care about the ""evil plot"" except for the fact that they killed our heroine to keep their little secret.

Which brings us to the next point. Giving Catwoman superhuman powers because she is brought back to life by some mystical Egyptian cat? Really? You're going to stick with that? That's not quite the MO for this character. Sure, she may act catty at times, but there is nothing supernatural about her. Adding this mystical element just distances the audience even further from the character. Revenge we understand. Slight insanity? Got it. Superhuman cat powers? You lost me.

Then there's the kinetic, motion-sickness-inducing direction. Do you think you could lock that camera down for a minute or two? Please? The lighting and coloring don't help in the least. It is just way too visually busy. I understand trying for ""artistic"" filming, but this is ridiculous.

In the end, the only reason I gave this more than one star is that, for those who want to see how to ruin a movie, this is something you could actually sit through and take notes. As the movie ends, you truly don't care about anyone or anything in the whole movie. So it gets one extra star for the education it gives in bad film making.",1220572800,,2269,4.7316455696202535
1189775,5,B0000060X7,"I saw this movie on DVD because they never brought it to our cinema. I subsequently tried to purchase it on DVD but that order never arrived. I must have Patience's bad luck with this movie! Either way, I am determined to own it because it's a really fun movie and has a plausible storyline that actually makes sense to me, is thought-provoking and is not overdone or over-acted, contrary to what some reviewers say. I believe those reviewers probably watched a different movie - or are of the comic-book fan crowd who hated the movie before they even saw it.

All the actors delivered fine performances. I especially liked the tie-in with the history of cats, which lent credibility to the plot. One of my favorite scenes is actually not of Halle as catwoman but when Patience (revived) and Lone play basketball - it looked really cool.

I read what Halle said about the movie when accepting her Razzie - although I believe she didn't really mean it (besides what else could she say) especially since she later said she would consider doing a sequel. I say 'bring it on' WB!",1220400000,4,1075,4.59375

I agree a better villain could have been better, but Sharon did a good job.  I love Sharon.  Maybe if she were a sci fi villain instead of a normal person with a face of marble.  Anyway, there are worse things in this movie:

Editing, don't know if it was the directors fault but I hate choppy movies ex. Moulin Rouge etc...

Soundtrack, horrible. I hate the whole pussycat doll wailing in the background.  Would have been better just classical film soundtrack.

Costume, the mask was ugly, the pants were ok I guess don't like the bell bottom look.  I agree with others that the costume she wore at the jewelry store was much better.  I liked seeing her hair and the mask was cute.

So finally her acting.  It was great, you people associate everything horrible in the movie with her but it's not her fault.  Her acting was not bad at all.  The dialogue and corny lines are the faults.  But again not all her lines were bad.

She had the cool right cat attitude.  Her movements were great, specially when she wakes up from death, just like a cat watching and playing with something.  Her changes from geek to cool to bad were right on and her emotions were shown when needed.

So my challenge to the makers in hollywood is to give Catwoman another chance.  Do a remake like the hulk with Halle even.  Or make her play Catwoman in the next Batman movie, she deserves a chance.

You could tell Hallie was struggling to be sexy in this movie when it should have come off naturally.

The villain was just all right, nothing special.

1189779,3,B0000060X7,"I feel sorry for the makers of ""Catwoman"": here they were, just trying to make a superhero/action film, but ended up being responsible for what's been considered one of the worst films ever made.
Okay, I'll come clean: ""Catwoman"", if judged against other superhero flicks, belongs on the rungs closer to ""Daredevil"" than ""Batman"", but despite the slapdash story, script, pacing, characters, and that godawful costume, I managed to enjoy it. You might too, if you're not a Catwoman loyalist (in which case, this movie gave you plenty to fume about)...

Knock what you know of the DC character out of your head: Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) is a timid artist working for a cosmetics company, who is killed for uncovering the dangerous side-effects of her company's new product; mysteriously revived by the cat she saved earlier in the day, Patience comes to realize that she has acquired the physical powers (and traits) of a cat, and is quick to utilize them to bring down the launch of the dangerous new product.

For this film, it's probably best to talk about its bad aspects first. To state the obvious, the movie is a commercial sellout: absolutely everything - from cutout characters to painfully-obvious plot twists - conforms to formulas you've seen a hundred times before, and offers nothing innovative. The action, while occasionally nifty, is almost entirely CGI or performed by a stunt double - Halle Berry never really lifts a finger. And where's the super-villain? - if you were expecting for any DC baddies, think again.
Oh, and the usually-amazing Frances Conroy (""Six Feet Under"") gives the worst performance of her life as Opelia Powers; she looks like she's on crack.

Still, for what it's worth, director Pitof (""Vidocq"") does his darndest to keep the movie entertaining: with few interesting characters to work with, he keeps the film looking interesting with a stylized colour palette and camera angles. The swift cuts and editing will either keep your attention or give you a headache. Throw in some good CGI and decent, one-sided action scenes, and you can easily find yourself entertained for a single evening.

Needless to say, this stand-alone adventure won't make you neglect Michelle Pfeiffer in ""Batman Returns"" or any of the femme fatale's previous outings, but as for being one of the worst films ever made, ""Catwoman"" falls short of the mark. Don't be prejudiced - give it a rent.",1211932800,3,2415,4.9851116625310175

1189781,1,B0000060X7,"Dont get it twisted. This is an awful film. Halle Berry cant take full blame for the reason why this movie sucks. The script was juvenile and corny. Halle Berry gives the worst performance of her illustrious acting career in this movie. She plays Patience Williams(wasnt the original Catwoman called Selina Kyle?), a timid beauty ad designer who accidently stumbles on to an evil plan by the owner of the company she works for. The evil plan involves marketing a beauty cream that is known to cause skin disorder and cancer. Patience is chased out of the building and into a drainage system where she falls to her doom and is revived by a cat.

Opinion: This movie is humoruosly bad. Her origin with the cat that revives her is laughable. The way she walks so awkwardly(like she's had one too many catnip) in that tacky cat suit is a riot. The way she cracks that whip like an amateur dominatrix is hysterical. The fight scenes s well as the dialogue is laughable too. The most funniest and probably the worst scene in the movie is where she beats her soon-to-be boyfriend/cop in basketball with HIGH HEELS ON!!! She looked like a total goof dribbling that ball between her legs. Then there's those moments in the movie where you have to suspend your intellect like the time Halle slid through those prison bars without getting stuck or the fact that the toxic cream that the main villain is peddling makes her(the villian) immune to punches and kicks that would knock the average person unconscious.

Closing comments: This is the worst movie that Halle Berry has ever starred in and is another blemish is her movie career. The acting is dreadful and the action is a joke. I would be surprised if she could still find work but then again if Eddie Murphy could find roles to play after the crappy I-Spy then Halle should be able to bounce back from this.

But every time it's come on t.v. I would find myself watching it. I decided to actually go to Best Buy to Buy it, that's how much i wanted to see it. Great storyline (they should have just called her Selina Kyle though, I don't know WHY THEY didn't call her that.) But yeah great movie. I would have liked to see on the dvd sketches for the costume, Halle practicing using the whip or cracking it. Maybe some concept designs on what didn't get shot but was on the drawing boards. If Catwoman were not In BAtman Returns and ont the animated series, this movie probably could have been seen by itself but everyone had their idea of what it should have been and that's why people say it's not a good movie. But I bet everyone like myself watches it.

Now, my opinion on why it didn't work.

Costume
When I, like everyone else saw it first I absolutely was pissed off at whoever made it the way it was. I remember even before the movie came out everyone was pissed at the costume and i know by how Halle looked in interviews she knew it was bogus to. I mean come on CSI has been on for a while so common sense of viewers would be to know you can't be half naked b/c you'll leave evidence (DNA, blood if you get stabbed, fingerprints, etc). Not only was the exposed skin a problem but the glittered gloves was dumb and I like a lot of people HATED THE MASK. It was toooooo tall. I mean the ears were all the way up there. Bogus. And the opened toed shoes was dumb too. REallly dumb. I BET if she had a cooler costume it would have worked out better in sales/box office.

2. Storyline

Okay Catwoman has always been a major thief so they really should have made her want to steal things more. If they were getting pressure from the Parental control (whoever does ratings of movies, then i see why they should have avoided it, but the plotline could have been Catwoman steals from the rich snobby elite clique of clients that have invested in this guy stealing exotic cats (lions, tigers, etc) from jungles and zoos and putting them on display at his own personal mansion. Not only that but later it's revealed some of the investing clients (rich snobs, women, men etc) want to get the cats furs made into coats (sorta like Dalmations movie). That would justify the theft from CAtwoman. Steal from the evil people.

Totally dissed the fanbase

In these kinds of movies with HUGE fanbases, it's a pretty dummmmbbbb BUSINESS MOVE (if you're looking at just for the money)  to take a name, movie, concept and then make a completely different movie with it. That's what they did and it was a dumb move. The fans are the ones that pump in the money to knock the movie into the #1 spot on the box office. They're the ones that see the movie three and four times. (I saw the first X-men movie 3 times even though I wasn't as impressed, but it stayed a little more truer to the comics as far as powers concepts, etc). We're also the ones that help with the DVD sales. So, the creators totally pissed on the fans. Well let me be nice about it. Okay, Catwoman can be compared to vampire movies. Now vampire movies have been done SOOOO MANY TIMES that you can deviate from the classic great vampire movies, because you have to set yourself apart if you wanna get a pat on the shoulder. It's only necessary if you want a medal or soemthing, other thann that you can still do a basic vampire movie. The ones that keep truesst to a vampire (having teeth, and drinking blood are usually the requirements for it to do well)
now the problem with this movie is that Catwoman hasn't been done enough times to deviate from the known concept. It would have been different if Michelle Pheifer had done that solo movie (she had a baby i think that's why she dropped out). Or if there were a Catwoman t.v. show, but there hasn't been enough on it, that's why fans were pissed at this movie.
I NEVER THOUGHT race was an issue with this b/c one Eartha Kitt was CAtwoman and she did a phenomenal job. Besides with only the hairpiece/ears being different she was basically playing the same role. So that's not an issue. I truly was envisioning Halle with the long hair (like in the first part of the movie) in the purple costume. I would have believed and I would have loved it.

Halle I think did say if they revamped it (probably meaning did it like the comics, be more truer to it, like Storm in part 3 of X-men) then she'd do it, and I hope she would. AS a promo someone needs to have a mannequin dressed in the purple outfit to show what could have been. it still can do really well. I think that bootleg independent movie is doing rather well.

1189787,4,B0000060X7,"Superheroes have always been the object of a systematic cult in the USA. So sooner or later a woman had to come into the picture and since Supergirl never satisfied anyone, they had to look for someone else, someone a little bit more attractive. And since Spiderman had many long legs and arms blocking the way they had to look somewhere else farther out of the way. They looked in Egypt, they looked in China, they looked in the Middle Ages for an animal connected to women and who was both satanic and in relation with freedom, liberty and freewheeling. That's how the cat came out of the wizard's hat or bonnet. Catwoman was thus saved from the water of the river, which is absolutely accurate, and brought back to life in the human world of the night. She became the queen of the roofs. Then add a dishonest but successful industrialist exploiting women with beauty products that you must definitely not stop if you don't want to develop some strange Karposi syndrome or cancer. Then add his wife, an old belle who has aged faster than necessary and who wants to get rid of her husband and put her hands on the golden goose and the bank reserves before he finally realizes he does not need her anymore. And then you have the perfect thriller. A little bit of romance between the cop who is supposed to arrest Catwoman and the woman she is supposed to be and you have a heartbreaking story. But the poor Catwoman cannot stay because she is nothing but a living dead. So sadness takes over and she can only exist at night and on the roofs of the city. And there you have some kind of a myth of the cat seen as a symbol of ... what have I said already? But what's the meaning of this fable? Nothing is crystal clear in this tale, or if it is clear it is just as clear as black pudding juice at the bottom of a completely opaque wooden bottle. Only a cat can see anything in there.

1189789,1,B0000060X7,"When I first saw the previews for this particular movie, I thought it looks good, great even. But when I went to see Catwoman in theaters I was sorely disappointed.

First off Catwoman's name is Selina Kyle not Patience or whatever her name was in the movie. That just drove me nuts! Also I'm not as familiar with Catwoman's origin story as I am with like Batman or the Teen Titans, but I'm pretty sure she was not the heir of some ancient line of cat women. I'm sure to know well about the origins of Catwoman though once the copy of Catwoman: Her Sister's Keeper arrives for me at the library.

The costume.. Wow I didn't know Catwoman was suppose to be so racey. If I had to guess the costume in Catwoman was designed for a guy's eyes. I know that Catwoman is known for her whip and tight, form fitting costumes, but it is almost always a form of a body suit. I don't think Catwoman has ever really been known for prancing around on roof tops half naked.

In my opinion they should have stuck with a proper version of Catwoman's origins and explained them like they are explained in the comics and most novels. Also they should have kept her name Selina Kyle. I think a lot of fans were upset about the name change. It was totally uncalled for. Lastly, I think if would have been better if they went with a costume similar to the one Selina Kyle currently wears in the comics. That is such a cool costume and it probably would have been cool on the big screen.

Overall, I wouldn't reccommend this. If you want to find some real Catwoman stuff read Batman Hush or maybe Catwoman: When in Rome. Something along those lines, but I wouldn't watch this movie. It sucks.",1188518400,2,1668,4.336538461538462

Then as the reviews started pouring in and I heard things like ""Halle slurps tuna out of cans,"" ""Halle is given mouth-to-mouth by a cat,"" and ""Halle says insipid lines like 'cat got your tongue?'"" I knew I HAD to see this. I went on opening night for the express purpose of laughing at it, hoping that the entire audience would be with me. Imagine my shock and horror as I found myself actually enjoying it.

Don't get me wrong, this is by no means a GOOD movie. The plot in particular hinges on one ludicrous conceit on top of another, and many developments don't stand up to the SLIGHTEST scrutiny, but you know, the whole thing is just so over-the-top ridiculous that you stop caring after a while. Even all the ridiculous elements (i.e. tuna cans), in the context of the movie, don't stand out as glaringly, and since they play it off as Halle is in effect possessed by her cat side, all these compulsive things she's doing sort of work in that context.

I didn't like the CONSTANTLY moving camera (and I was sitting in the 3rd row, so it really was nausea-inducing) and the CHEEEEEEEESY digital effects work, but I felt that his idea was to create this entirely pop fantasy comic book universe, so at least it was an IDEA. It didn't work that well, but it was an IDEA.

I think it's clear that the Sharon Stone part of the storyline was inspired in large part by THE WASP WOMAN, a 50's horror film in which a woman is the owner of a cosmetics company, and was once the lead model, but is now growing older and has to step down as model. She experiments with wasp royal jelly [though I am pretty sure that wasps don't make royal jelly] in order to hold on to her youth... and of course it turns her into a vicious wasp woman! Sharon Stone in this film follows the same storyline except that the face cream turns her face indestructible. Until it destructs, of course, but let's not quibble.

All of the Spice Girls-level ""feminism"" this movie supposedly espouses--the usual shtick about how a woman is ""empowered"" by dressing in outrageously skimpy outfits and becoming a walking product placement for Revlon--is undone by the ending, in which Sharon Stone, her face finally [and inexplicably] cracked, decides that it is better to die than live life as an unattractive person.

The ending was also reminiscent of Spiderman, except that it wasn't for the good of humanity, but for the good of those she knew.

Halle Berry did a good job of portraying the artsy self-conscious Patience and the Catwoman character.  The movie was quite clean as well.  There was minimal swearing, the violence wasn't sick or gross, and no nudity though the Catwoman outfit was a bit revealing (and didn't look comfortable).  I also liked the link to history, and it made me wonder how much was real and how much was contrived about that.  As for that beauty product - no matter the side affects, I bet there are a few women who would want to use it anyway, fully knowing what it will do to you.

There were a few cheesy moments such as obvious CGI and her stuntwoman not looking quite like her.  But this is that sort of movie genre, so some of that is to be expected.

One example of this.... when 'catwoman' goes into a bar with that stupid mask, and asks for a drink.. she asks for a drink and it takes her no longer than a second or two to drink it.. she then looks at the bartender, wide eyed, and trying to look cool, as if to say ""Hey wasn't that cool?? Did that not make you think I am awesome?? It only took me a second to drink that!!""

Don't waste your time with this.. I will never watch the rest of the movie, it is already, no exagerations, the worst movie I have ever seen.",1152489600,4,920,4.146067415730337

Special effects were weak - the CGI Catwoman was simply not as smooth as we have come to expect. The script was patterened around the original Catwoman comics (at least as I remember it) and likely is too pedestrian for today's audiences.

THis film is by now means a 'disaster', however, it was quite entertaining. Just not aimed at anyone who thought 'Team America' was anything other than complete garbage.",1151884800,3,545,4.797872340425532

Positives: Halle Berry has one of the prettiest faces and figures in film today. You'll probably watch the movie from beginning to end for that reason alone. Benjamin Bratt is terrific as Tom Lone, police detective and love interest to Patience ""Catwoman"" Phillips and Frances Conroy (Ophelia) provides some much needed depth and occult mystery to the plot as the historian and guardian of the Egyptian Goddess Baast and the ""Secret Society of Catwoman.""

Negatives: Sub-par special effects, silly plot and a little too much S&M motif in the choice of costume for my taste.",1151193600,7,792,4.8161764705882355

1189810,3,B0000060X7,"You know, with all the limitless amount of bad reviews and even worse word-of-mouth, you sooner or later start believing in them as well. That's exactly what happened to me. I accepted all the big name critic's reviews, and what everyone else has thought of this movie. And so, I began trashing the movie too, ever since pre-production. I snapped out of recently, realizing how it foolish it was not to give something a chance just because of the bad reputation it gets. This was definately not the way I was raised, and so I watched the movie. And yes, to a delightful surprise, it definately is not as bad as you and everyone has said it to be.

Halle Berry plays Patience Philips, a very shy and picked on woman who isn't happy about the way her life turned out. Working for a beauty company, she untiringly creates ads as her job. One day, through unfortunate events, she is resurrected as a Catwoman, which we'll soon find out has been a strong and very independent line of women in history who has been given a second chance and look on life.

Seeing that Halle played the out-of-costume Patience very genuinely and without effort, I was kind of expecting the worse when Catwoman was being brought out of Patience. I remember what people said when Catwoman did the many cat traights in the film, like the purring and in the infamous ""catnip"" ball scene. I expected to cringe at those moments, but smiled at how campy they were. Very essential to the character, but not in excess it'll drive you crazy. Actually, those moments were very short, and realizing that Patience was getting used to her new personality and cat habits, it's not surprising that she'll lose control and go catty. But towards the end of the film, you see how Patience is beginning to control her dual personas, a job that I think Halle did very well on. And this Catwoman is not as horrbile as those played in the 1960s, by Eartha Kitt for example. If you've seen and remember the old shows and movies, you know how bad this Catwoman could've been; every word coming out of Halle's mouth would've been with a purr of the end, and she would've been much more ditsy and loose, if you know what I mean.

The plot of the movie is a little cheesy, yes I agree with that. But it was something that I definately haven't seen on screen before! A beauty company turning their consumers into addictive, cracking human boulders?! Laughable, but something orignal at least. I also thought this Catwoman not being associated with Gotham or Batman was also trying something new. We've already seen the orignal Catwoman in ""Batman Returns"", and  Selina Kyle's story. As nice as it would've been, making a movie about Selina Kyle would have just been recycling much of that character from ""Batman Returns"".

There were many things that I ddin't like about the film. The costume is too exposing and unrealistic. Purely there for eye candy. It doesn't really matter though, the costume doesn't get in the way of enjoying the film for me. There was also way too much CGI in the movie. Although many of the skyscrapers, for example, were realistic, most of the others things weren't. Things that could have been filmed with the real things, were replaced with CGI. Cats, surroundings, and Halle herself. Even moments when Halle was just standing on a balcony were completely CGI. And I thought Frances Conroy's character as the ""Catmaster"" was really out of place, but at least Patience's transformation doesn't go unexplained. And the best friend character played by Alex Borstein is so cliched, but a girl has to have some girlfriends.

So bottom-line: This movie is perfect for a night of lazy entertainment. The acting was good by all the characters, the action scenes were realistic and well choreographed, the sets were dazzling, the chemistry between Tom and Patience was very romantic, and the message of the film; being strong, independent, and unafraid of life's joruney is something we all can live by.

1189812,1,B0000060X7,"When it comes to comic-book spin off movies; this is the worst case scenrio moment, ladies and gentlemen.

Here we have one Pateince Phillips ( This is not the same woman in BATMAN RETURNS. That secreatary was named Selina Kyle and was the love interest in BATMAN RETURNS.), a shy, awkward, intellectually misunderstood woman who uncovers a supposedly deadly secret: The cosemetics company she works for is being ambushed by someone putting poisens into the products. After witnessing the criminals talking, she follows a series of piping that eventually leads to her downfall. She is ressurected, somehow, by cats, and is on a juorney of special-ability discovering.

If you ask me, the story is all hype and style and no substance. It's a mock up to the legendary villian that is CATWOMAN. Although Halle Berry looks the part it's just too sloppy of a plot. It's good for a thought but not for a whole movie.

There's even moments of a CGI catwoman. God Help them is all I have to say.

Along with some crooked lines and too many musical cues, this makes for a music video of Catwoman, Muscial Montage, that is just too long for comfort and too silly to be a movie. They should have left it alone or tried again.

1189813,2,B0000060X7,"I often cite films by Ed Wood and Uwe Boll as perfect educational films. Why? Well they're perfect examples of how not to make a film. So when films come out every year that are really terrible, you just gotta ask ""is this worse than Plan 9 or Alone in the Dark? Well with Catwoman we find a film that's better than those but that's not saying much.

Patience Phillips(why they changed it from Selina Kyle is beyond me) works as an advertisement artist for a beauty creme company. In order to make a deadline, she searches an old factory and finds out something bad about the upcoming Beau-Line(prounounced Beeyoo-Lin for some reason) and gets washed up in the river. Brought back to life by a mystical cat, which for some reason worked better under Tim Burton, she comes back as Catwoman ready to do battle against justice, and flirt with a cop.

I haven't heard of a Rogues Gallery villain in Superman or Batman that got their own movie. You don't see Brainiac trying to save the world somewhere, or Two-Face fighting crime. So when Batman comics jewel thief becomes a crime fighter, it's kind of ""huh?"". And like I said, the decision to name her Patience Phillips instead of time tested Selina Kyle is forever lost to me. Imagine Superman being called Trevor Smith. Not to mention the costume looks quite ridiculous since not only does Halle Berry have an obvious skin tone but it just smacks of laziness.

An unfortunate by-product of upstart directors is they're a little clueless on how to edit action scenes, believing the more faster the cuts, the more energetic it is. Compare this to Spielberg, Cameron or Zemeckis films that allow the action to unfold at its own pace. Here it's literally blink and you'll miss it shots. I know kids today have ADD when watching a movie but this is pushing it.

It's right up there with Punisher and Fantastic Four as bad comic book movies but it's kind of borderline dumb entertainment and nothing more...unless you get a kick in seeing Halle Berry in her costume.",1142121600,,2009,4.634831460674158
1189814,3,B0000060X7,"This review should be 2.5 stars, but I had to choose between 2 or 3 so... I read lots of reviews before posting this one, and still have things to add (although the review by Jane Rhynn ""Jane the Dervish"" offers pretty interesting insights). OVERVIEW: A woman acquires cat-like powers and finds herself fighting evil while also tempted to do some naughty things. This is no worse than most of the comic book movies from Batman to Spiderman, and most people who like super-hero movies will probably have fun watching this once, especially on DVD where you can do laundry or polish your shoes during the sillier parts. HIGHLIGHTS: I was pleased to see a sensual black woman -- the first since TV Batman's Eartha Kitt! -- play Catwoman. Yes, Michelle Pfeiffer was good as the Batman movie's tortured Catwoman, but Halle Berry's Catwoman is just as beautiful and more acrobatic and, well, even campier. The story starts with a promising mystical feel and tense story about an evil cosmetics company. Sharon Stone plays the aging company beauty just fine, another Faye Dunaway in the making. Benjamin Bratt is suitable in the modest role of cop/love interest. The cinematic and musical production values are pretty good, what you'd expect of a popcorn action film. LOWLIGHTS: Halle is a good actress but the script, direction and editing defeat her. Once Halle turns into catwoman, the movie changes into an overextended music video with frenetic cuts and exaggerated closeups. Fine for a 3-minute video, this filming style interferes with the story telling in a real movie. It's also distracting to have the star overdo the butt swaying and to have slinky cat movements sped up into jerky action hero moves. The movie harshly shifts tone and point of view, and in trying to cater to both men and women, actually fails both. For example, the shots of Halle's rear as she bounces a basketball with Benjamin are clearly inserted just to titillate the male factor. Such scenes embarrass many women who roll their eyes and wait for the story to move on. BOTTOM LINE: Worth the price of a rental.",1141603200,5,2086,4.829608938547486

1189816,1,B0000060X7,"Plot-less, script-less, and without a whisker of wit or cred, Catwoman is an insipid saussage in the assembly-line of super-hero movies:  kiddie product with millionaire budgets.  The big difference is that Catwoman has lowered the required viewer IQ from age ten to age five.

Even as a cartoon this concept would've flopped.

Halle Berry does no more than show off her bod as she parades/poses narcissistically from start to finish, every now and then uttering a laughably forgettable line.  Sharon Stone, who loves to boast about making 'intelligent flicks' (you'd think she writes her own material!), is your stock villain with no more depth than Berry's plank-of-wood acting.  The rest of the cast is just as painfully resource-less.  (Whoever played the cop should not have been allowed to graduate from high school if he took a drama class.)

The storyline treatment is a simplistic feminist yarn that reduces the cause to a bundle of overrehearsed gestures and slogans.  The jabs at the male-dominated system are caricaturesque at best, without a speck of insight or creativity.  If Berry and Stone thought they were somehow advancing the cause of women through parodic mainstream culture, they should stoop to read a book or take a course on the subject to get minimally educated (god forbid!).

It is a sign o' the times:  celebrities and product such as these -- with nothing to offer besides hollow image and wasteful budgets -- being overly marketed and rewarded by an industry intent on lowering the bar.  (By the way, is there anything this director CAN do well?)",1140566400,5,1578,5.0
1189817,2,B0000060X7,"How did this ever get made?  Oh this movie was so so bad.  While Halle Berry seems to have worked hard enough to make a name for herself, this movie set her back past Square One.  She has to reestablish herself all over again thanks to this tripe.

Halle Berry plays a churchmouse clerk named Patience at a cosmetics company that is about to introduce a new beauty cream.  When she discovers that this new miracle product has tragic side effects, she is done away with by the top executives of the company.  She survives the attack and becomes the inner vamp, Catwoman.

While this is certainly true to the roots of Catwoman in the comics, this movie is so terrible it's almost painful.  Halle Berry is acting like a cat (the jerky movements watching fish in an aquarium, liking sushi, etc.) and it looks ridiculous rather than insightful method acting.  The plot descintegrates as she is attempting to battle the evil corporation from releasing this product, her relationship with Bejamin Bratt goes to weirdness, and we are treated to little if anything than looking at her perfectly fit, cut body in those skin tight leathers with a whip.

Why 2 stars rather than 1?  Sharon Stone was pretty good in this movie, despite what she had to work with she is a great actress.

It sometimes seems more like an episode of TV BATMAN, with its droll humorless humor, and it's tongue in cheek.  Just watching Berry sashay around on rooftops with that tremendous swing on her back porch is enough to classify this as camp entertainment.  Berry is joined by Benjamin Bratt as her cop boyfriend, and the delighftully catty Sharon Stone as the villainess.

In a similar way, they manage to keep Catwoman herself believable, vulnerable and realistic, thanks in no small part to the beautiful and beguiling Halle Berry in the title role.

Berry plays Patience Phillips, a pretty, but less-than-glamorous advertising artist who works for a major cosmetics company, ruled over by a tyrannical CEO and his equally ruthless wife, the former spokes model for their products.  When Patience mistakenly overhears the corporate bigwigs discussing the fact that one of their best-selling creams is causing women to become seriously ill, she is dutifully murdered by a couple of the boss' henchmen.  However, all is not lost for Patience, for, unbeknownst to her, she has been chosen to receive the special gift of reincarnation in the form of a cat woman who will no longer be subject to the laws of either nature or society.

The best parts of ""Catwoman"" involve Patience's incrementally becoming more and more catlike in her attitude and demeanor, and her slowly dawning realization of what is happening to her.  It takes awhile for her to accept this surprising turn of events, but, when she does, she becomes, quite literally, a new woman, bold, self-confident and willing to take on the oppressors and evildoers in our society.  Patience is paired up with an attractive police officer (apparently the only one ever on duty in that city), who gradually comes to realize who and what she is as well.  Berry and Benjamin Bratt make a very appealing romantic couple, and their scenes together are some of the best in the movie.  Also impressive is Sharon Stone who deserves credit for allowing herself to appear in a role in which her ""fading"" beauty plays such a significant part (shades of Vivien Leigh playing Blanche DuBois in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"").  Stone is the villainous wife of the company's CEO who is determined to make sure Catwoman doesn't spill the beans on their defective product.

The special effects are probably the least successful aspect of this film.  Catwoman's jumping from rooftop to rooftop looks an awful lot like CGI effects to me.  And the movie does occasionally go on auto pilot (especially towards the end), though, thankfully, not usually for very long.  The literal cat fight between Berry and Stone at the finale is necessary, I guess, but really rather silly overall.

Still, considering the pounding this movie received from both critics and audiences when it was first released in the summer of 2004, I wound up being pleasantly surprised at just how enjoyable ""Catwoman"" turned out to be.",1137024000,33,2847,4.987315010570825

1189824,1,B0000060X7,"That's something that bugs me - agreeing with everyone else on here. Take something else I've reviewed, some reality TV dreck, I dunno - usually it's just full of reviews like ""Shayne really steals the show with his cover of Dancin' In The Moonlight, and now I luv this show 4eva and I luv Shayne 4eva"" by some mindless pondlife, then along comes The Curmudgeon and gives The Truth.

But here, it's both too easy and too hard. See, it's too easy because EVERYONE is slating this movie - every review is 2 stars or less and everyone is saying the same thing - that the movie sucks. And here's where it's too hard - it's too hard NOT to join in, because the movie is THAT bad.

A lot of people like to bunch together bad comic book movies as a discussion piece, and Catwoman will join that infamous list as its most recent calamity (but by no means the worst - step forward Supergirl for that honour). Now, box office flops usually get put alongside the bad ones, but just because they didn't do well financially doesn't make them bad (the Phantom and the new Punisher are two common names thrown in. Phantom was an excellent homage to the classic 30's serials, giving an old-fashioned sense of adventure with a likable hero, albeit in a silly costume and Punisher was just all kinds of awesome).

Catwoman, however, deserved to tank the way it did. And the likes of Phantom and Punisher didn't have either the cash or the media exposure this film did. As much as she attempts to save face nowadays (her post-modern, tongue in cheek ""victory speech"" as she won worst actress), Halle Berry promoted the HELL out of this film, and she really did think she was, ahem, the cats whiskers, trying to convince us all on numerous talk shows that this Catwoman was the sexiest thing on the screen.

And, lord, is it quite the opposite. Berry's catwoman is as alluring and sexy as some urine-soaked tramp sitting next to you on a bus. She ranges from acting really badly to just being plain embarrassing. When she's normal Patience Phillips (oh dear) she's bearable, if not exactly Oscar worthy (as she once was), but when she becomes Catwoman you really will be watching through your fingers as she says Miaow, ""purrrrrrrfect"", gets scared of the rain and hisses at dogs. Yes, all of this happens.

Add to the mix stereotypical sassy girlfriend, token gay guy making ""funny faces"" at her boyfriend, a ridiculous Sharon Stone and some beyond dodgy CGI and you have one movie that no amount of ""taking it on the chin"" good naturedness will save.

Nice Catwoman documentary on the DVD, mind. The rest is kitty litter.

My wife tuned out less than halfway through, but I guess my daughter and I were in the right mood--we laughed so hard at how terribly bad this movie is.  Hey, fun fact, Halle Berry actually won an Oscar a few years before she filmed this disaster--it's TRUE!  So, plotwise, apparently this shy incompetent hot girl, played by Berry, gets herself killed by businessmen so stupid that they're bringing to market a beauty cream that hideously disfigures its users--sell that stock NOW!  I fail to see the opportunity for a profit margin here, after the massive lawsuits.  Anyway, in the most touching scene of the film, the dead body of Halle Berry, still looking hot covered with green goo, is approached by a herd of cats, and one gives her the hairball of life.  Berry comes back to life, hacking as one who has just recieved the hairball of life would.  She then engages in all sorts of catlike behaviour, such as beating her boyfriend at basketball, stealing jewelry, beating up men, and turning into bad computer generated automation.  Unfortunately, the sex scene was deleted, so we don't know if Catwoman does it doggie style.  Also deleted were the scenes where she evicerates baby bunnies and leaves their heads on her owner's step, or where she hunts down and eats the rats in the alley behind her apartment.  Every other cliche in the book is there, the acting is terrible, the script absurd, and if you're in the right mood, Catwoman is an absolute treasure.  But whatever you do, don't BUY it....",1134086400,4,1582,4.737226277372263
1189826,1,B0000060X7,"Contrary to my long-held belief, I guess it does take more than pouring Halle Berry into a skintight outfit to hold my interest. Case in point: CATWOMAN, an oddly uninvolving action film that's short on action and long on flashy MTV-like visuals. It's your standard mousy-hero-becomes-vigilante comic book tale, although the stunning Miss Berry is never convincing as a wallflower. That's one of the basic problems: Because Halle is never believable as her character, we never become involved with her adventures. The lackluster screenplay doesn't help either; this is a straight-to-video endeavor masquerading as a major theatrical release. (Did someone fish this script out of Shannon Tweed's garbage dumpster?) Even the Catwoman costume seems like a slapped-together afterthought; wearing it, Berry looks like she's all set to star in the inevitable XXX-rated porno parody of the film. Benjamin Bratt hangs around to supply the obligatory hunky love interest, while Sharon Stone turns up as the equally perfunctory rich bitch villainess. CATWOMAN would be lame at any time, but in the wake of the exhilarating SPIDERMAN 2, its flaws are as conspicuous as Berry's cleavage.",1132272000,6,1175,5.391304347826087
1189827,5,B0000060X7,"This may not have been a ""plum"" of a role for such a high-caliber, beautiful actress, but Halle Berry would be good in any role. And it's not just her beauty! This fascinating woman can act!

And if she wants to play the part of a cat--or even a dog--in her next movie, I'll be first in line to buy a ticket.

Like her, I'm a native of Ohio, and we Buckeyes stick together.  (Just kidding! I stick with her because I admire the total woman she has become, despite a stormy background and obstacles that would halt a lesser person dead in her tracks.)

I look forward to seeing this talented, gorgeous actress in more Oscar-winning roles and feel assured that there will be many in her bright future!

1189828,1,B0000060X7,"How could a movie that features Halle Berry in a skimmpy, tight leather outfit be watchable. Well cause it's Hally Berry and she's hot but that's not enough to make this movie be worth anything. She doesn't even become Catwoman until about 1/2 hour in the movie. This movie is slow too. Not worth renting, watching at the bigscreen, watching it on HBO cable, or downloading on DVD burner. Sharon Stone has become un-attractive especially in this movie.",1131840000,2,452,4.8076923076923075

The graphics were great, and the storyline held my interest.

A beautiful job, Miss Halle. I wish you great success in your film career. Choose your scripts carefully and you will be one of the biggest stars of the twenty-first century.

1189830,2,B0000060X7,"I'll cover the good points first. Halle Berry did a good job considering the material she had to work with. Why she chose this role, I am not sure. Maybe she knew she would look really good in leather. Pratt was okay considering it wasn't much of a role. He was basically a boy toy (or cat toy?) Stone had a horrible role so I'm will not comment on her acting in this movie. How can you act when you are suppose to have a stone face?

The bad points are plentiful. The plot was unbelievable. The dialogue was horrendous. The CGI was unconvincing. The characters were silly. The mythology was laughable. At least Spiderman had a good message: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" Catwoman's message seems to be: ""Don't stand in the way of an independent woman."" Morality is ambigious. Independance is key. Oprah and Martha would be proud.",1131667200,2,847,4.6092715231788075
1189831,3,B0000060X7,"I'd heard so much bad publicity about this film that it took me forever to watch it.  It wasn't as bad as I expected, but I can understand the criticism.

When you say, ""Catwoman"", most people also think, ""Batman"".  The whole Catwoman story intersects with the Caped Crusader's story line.  This film does not.  This is a stand alone flick that twists several accepted plots.  This Catwoman has super powers that are more like Spiderman's.  The Catwoman I grew up with had mental powers and agility that were a match for the Batman.  The special effects of this film looked more like the effects in The Hulk than the dark edgy Gotham City we have grown accustomed to.

However, if I had not had a preconceived prejudice to overcome I would have liked the film more.  If this film had gathered enough attention to warrant a sequel, it would have been fun to watch Halle Berry play up Catwoman's fascination with Batman.  Alas, the film fell just a little short for that to happen.

It was a gamble, but I imagine this film is destined to set for a long time in the reduced price section at your local department stores, waiting for the occasional Halle Berry fan to pick it up and regularly overlooked by the Batman fans.  I'm not sure there really are a lot of Catwoman fans???",1131321600,3,1277,4.5

1189835,4,B0000060X7,"I'll get to the explaination of the title of my review in a momemt. I watched this movie and I liked it. I like any movie where a woman comes into her own and realizes how powerful she truly is, even if she has to die first, because when it comes down to it often a part of a woman does have to ""die""  sometimes for her to find the inner strength she has actually always possessed but just didn't know it. I loved the way there was actually a HISTORY of how she was able to be brought back to life instead of just falling 100 stories out of a window and being chewed on and licked on by some cats and just coming back to life like Pfiefer did in one of those Batman movies. I like Halle Berry and respect what she has had to go through to be where she is today, and if I were going to dislike a movie she was in it would be Monsters Ball, because her ending up a@@ naked and screwing a bigot did nothing for me. I feel as if most of YOU PEOPLE disliked this movie because you feel HOW DARE SHE as a BLACK WOMAN take on the role of Catwoman. If this role had been portrayed by brittany or jessica, I feel the reviews would have been a lot kinder. The chemistry between her and Benjamin Bratt was HOT...so hot that I still remember an article in a magazine that said he got himself into a bit of trouble with his wife because he expressed to her how wonderful he found Halle. So for all of you haters out there, get over it, WE are here to stay and WE are able to take on roles that you feel WE shouldn't and do them justice no matter what you may think or say...and just to piss most of you off even more the best Catwoman there EVER has been was EARTHA KITT!!",1128124800,2,1659,3.9375
1189836,1,B0000060X7,"Let me be very clear from the outset: there is not one feature contained within this 104 minute stretch of celluloid that could possibly be misconstrued as entertaining. There are no laughs, there is no originality. There is no acting, no direction, no talent. What little action there is has been done so many times before, and so much better than this. There is, in fact, nothing at all that could possibly induce me to think of this shambolic and wasteful excuse for a movie with anything other than total contempt.

Jim Balent, he knows Catwoman. Julie Newmar and Eartha Kitt, they knew Catwoman. Michelle Pfeiffer, in my opinion, is the definitive Catwoman. Halle Berry is very clearly landing a paycheque. She, in vulgar parlance, stinks. If you're a fan of hers, avoid this movie, it's upsetting to watch a woman who clearly has talent sell herself so very, very short, and if you're not a fan,still do not see this movie. She'll most likely turn you off all Superhero movies until the end of time. Dull, tedious, predictable, and laughable (the Meeow scene and the purring?? What the hell were you thinking, Halle??), Ms. Berry's ""performance"" (if such trash could indeed be called a performance) is at best, offensive, and at worst, the personification of everything that's wrong with the current trends of Image-Driven Hollywood.

The supporting cast are embarrassing. The Fat Friend, the stock Boyfriend, and the utterly ridiculous role of Cat-Yoda as played by Frances Conroy (who, it must be said, simply does not belong here) are all hugely homogenous and throwaway, and Sharon Stone as the evil Laurel Hedare is completely pointless. She is not glamorous enough to be believable as the Supermodel-turned-Businesswoman and not strong enough a presence on-screen to be believable as the Villianess.

Direction, as with so many other of the second-rate Superhero movies that studios seem to be churning out these days, relies far too heavily on BAD computer-generated sequences and seizure-inducing flash-shot fight scenes, so the whole visual 'feel' of the movie is one of regurgitated television-standard nonsense. When compared to recent Action classics like ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" it pales into nothingness. Get a clue, Hollywood: fans of action want to see real people performing real stunts, and not a slowmo 30 frames-per-second CGI Halle Berry Butt-In-Pleather floating up a wall to avoid gunshots.

I can't tell you in one single review how truly awful this movie is. And I'm a fan of bad movies, on a superficial level. 'Mommie Dearest', 'The Howling', 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes' - all of them have comedy value. 'Catwoman'? Well, that's just plain awful.",1126828800,12,2691,5.095238095238095

1189838,3,B0000060X7,"This time we have a slightly different Catwoman than comic book readers are familiar with.  This time, Catwoman is merely the current incarnation of a long-running historical character that goes bach through the ages.  Patience (Catwoman) gets her start when she dies.  Mystic cats resurrect her and give her her new abilities.  Patience/Catwoman then has to balance between her two personalities as she tries to find her life's path.

This is a very feminine movie.  Our hero represents a female warrior archetype.  She must face and foil the world of men (the police and authority).  Her foe is the maker of beauty cream.  But the new beauty cream could be dangerous to all women who would use it.  All in all most of the characters and imagery are feminine in nature.  This should appeal to female audiences while the skimpy costume should keep the testosterone wielders interested as well.

The disk comes with an interesting documentary about the many faces of Catwoman with interviews with the various women who have taken on the role as well as others involved in the television/film versions.  All in all a pretty good disk.",1126483200,3,1132,4.894736842105263
1189839,1,B0000060X7,"After last years dismal reviews from critics and most ""movie laity"" alike and with the info that this catwoman had no relation to any of the Batman incarnations, I decided to wait, until a moment when I may see it for free. Well, that days was today, and let me say, I'm glad I saved the price of admission, although I cannot get my hour and forty-five minutes back.

Almost every clip of film is a mistep. First, Halle Barry was poor and to sex her up (why they took this step is beyond me, she is naturally gorgeous), they cut up the outfit and put her in a ""bra.""  Her first appearance as Catwomen was sexier when it was less revealing.  secondly, her movements were poor and the CGI overly amatuerish at best (compare to Spider-man or X-Men and one gets the point).

Next, Sharon Stone is just a bore.  Stone really has only one good acting performance to her credit (The Mighty - she was terrific).  While attracive, she has always been overated, or she just may be making poor role choices.

Bratt is the only bright spot, but the script and direction is so poor, one doesn't care. Actually, maybe I should give the actors a break and charge the producers, director, and writers with a felony.  This movie is that bad and it makes Batman & Robin as well as Breaker-Breaker, look like masterpieces. Save your time and if it is Catwomen you want, by Batman the Movie (1966), Batman Returns, or any of the appearances in Batman, the Animated Series (actually, great Catwomen stories in this cartoon).  For a great graphic novel series involving her, read Batman:Hush - all of these are available here on Amazon.",1126051200,4,1614,4.518900343642612
1189840,3,B0000060X7,"Our society is filled with sheep and many of them would like you to believe how baaaad this movie is.  Well, they're wrong.  IMHO, ""Wild Wild West"" with Will Smith is the worst movie of all time with the recent remake of ""Ladykillers"" with Tom Hanks following a close second.  Catwoman is not even close to being in their league.  As a matter of fact I find it to be on par with ""The Fast and the Furious"", ""The Transporter"", and the X-men movies.  With the exception of the first two, the Batman series SUCKED and did not get nearly the trashing that this movie unfairly received.  I don't include the superior ""Batman Begins"" movie with the others.

Halle Berry's acting is pretty good and she looked amazing!  I felt the duality she was trying to bring to the role when her character began to change.  Her chemistry with Benjamin Bratt was very hot and they made a very good couple.  Sharon Stone was beautiful in this movie and held her own as the bad guy.  Her character was not contrived in the least, none of the characters were.

All and all, I think this movie was entertaining, had a good amount of action, and had a good plot.  I think the female characters were strong and three-dimensional.  Alex Borenstein is great as Halle's friend and adds that bit of comic relief that was just perfect.  Yes, the single women obsess over getting dates - BFD - that's what single women do!  It doesn't mean they are idiots or weak because they want to find a companion.

So give this movie a try and watch it with an open mind.  If you go looking for a turkey, you will find one.  I prefer to be optimistic and make up my own mind.  I'm glad I watched this movie!",1124928000,5,1664,4.340909090909091
1189841,2,B0000060X7,"After all of the promotional hype I expected something more from this movie than a catty meow! But I guess comic book subjects aren't rocket science. I just can't understand why Oscar winner Halle Berry would claw her way to the bottom so soon.

Catwoman (Halle Berry) rises from the spirit of an ancient cat who breathes new life into a lowly ad-woman. By the light of a full moon Catwoman stalks her prey beginning with ancient jewelry, as a ""cat-burglar"" and suddenly becoming a crime fighting kitty with heart. Both in and out of costume Catwoman seduces Detective Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) with her feline charms. The bad guys run a cosmetics company that fights the aging but makes one sick in the process. Laurel and George Hedare (Sharon Stone/Lambert Wilson) eventually become Miss Kitty's prey in this predictable tale out of Gotham.

This overly done film is pretty much a music video for pretty little Halle Berry to strut her well developed stiff to. So it will always appeal to the easily pleased young male mindset. However it is a disappointment to see such a wonderful actress fall so low in the ranks after winning a well deserved Oscar (for Monster's Ball). The costumes and prowling scenes are posed for the young video game enthusiast. The action shots are obviously computer generated and the cuts between the two are simply horrible. Bratt and Berry are convincing enough as romantic leads but somehow lose their context within this movie. Sharon Stone is the one standout, playing a more than convincing aging menace to society.....and she looks great doing it. If you are a Gotham fan looking for good Catwoman material try Michelle Pfeiffer in the role in Tim Burton's film ""Batman Returns"" (1992), Pfeiffer does a much better job as the playful kitty. Sadly Halle should stick to what she does best DRAMA and leave the meowing to another litter of up and coming starlets without their reputation at stake.",1124755200,18,1932,4.833836858006042

Halle Berry was terrific as Catwoman.  She was sexy and confident, moving and walking just like a cat.  The leather outfit and the whip were both wicked fun.  Sharon Stone was the perfect villian.  A great blend of beauty and the beast.  Benjamin Bratt was a very nice addition with his great smile, smoldering eyes and his kind, softspoken manner.  This movie was taken way too seriously.  It was meant to be fun and lighthearted, a fantasy.  Some of the dialogue was a bit cheesy, and the digital animation could have been better, but overall, it was a enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.",1124668800,3,738,4.564885496183206

It might have been best to make Patience Phillips more psychologically complex--i.e. have the Catwoman transformation affect her in a supernatural, but also disturbing way (as what happened to Selina Kyle in the Batman Returns film).

I thought Halle played the innocent clumsy girl role very well in portraying Patience Phillips in the begining of the movie and then shifting over to the more sexy catwomen role after she was resurrected from death by the cats.  I liked the basketball court scene when she plays B.Bratt one on one with all the kids screaming in the background.  She really looks sexy in that scene.  In my mind I think she is in the top 5 actresses out there today.  The women does have acting ability.  That is without question.

1189847,4,B0000060X7,"Possibly the worst, most entertaining movie i've ever seen.  Seriously, i was on in a fitworks dark room and I ended up going on the exercise machine for the entire hour and a half. Never happened before and will never happen again, but I just couldn't bring myself to leave.

So, basically, what was everyone expecting?  An award winning Titanic?  I mean, it's called ""catwoman"" and has halle berry in a tight leather cat suit.  Give it a break.  It's fun, action packed entertainment with a really really corny plot. So go into it, knowing what it is, and don't be so hard on it.  Unlike some movies that are actually supposed to be all ""deep"" and ""masterpieces"", this movie was actually interesting, not to say those aren't, but a lot of them can put people to sleep in minutes.

However, I was impressed by the visual effects of some scenes.  They were like, wow, that's cool.  More if you're an artsy type of person but they were just, very pretty.  And the romance was surprisingly cute. I really liked seeing the two of them on the screen.

My one and only complaint is that i have a cat and this movie had the most uncat like catwoman ever.  Dont know if you've ever seen the batman catwoman, but now that was a cat.  She's like ""meow"" and struts around real slow hitting things.  Doesn't move too much.

This catwoman crawled on ceilings and moved at lightening speeds, hopping on walls.  My cat has still never done that, and I don't know too many cats that do. She also kept jumping around and moving and doing acrobat flips and couldn't sit still for a single second, while my cat just sleeps in a ball for seventeen hours a day, stretches, then moves somewhere else and goes back to sleep.  Cats don't move ever. Make a mental note of that should catwoman ever be reborn for the third time. they also fit like, one half a kitty nibble in their mouth at a time, and lick at the surface juice of a can of cat food. they don't shove in a dozen giant shrimps. They eat.... very... tiny... bits.... at a time. So, all i kept thinking was, this is the worst cat i've ever seen. try harder.

cute movie though.",1121558400,2,2116,4.37948717948718
1189848,1,B0000060X7,"What a nightmare.  Somebody pinch me and wake me up.  That's what I kept thinking while watching this movie, which turned out to be a truly painful experience.  And I'm not generally a conspiracy theorist, but after enduring ""Catwoman,"" directed by Pitof (who? who?), I'm convinced that someone (or ones) are out to sabotage the careers of both Halle Berry and Sharon Stone (not to mention Benjamin Bratt).  It's one thing to set out to make a ""B"" movie, but to waste such talent and beauty through sustained incompetence (yes, sustained, this movie wasn't filmed in a single day, was it?  Come to think of it, maybe it was...) is nothing short of criminal (cinematically speaking).

I do not like to dwell on the negative aspects of any film, and I always attempt to seek out the positive (even most bad movies have something good in them, though you often have to look hard and deep to find it), but in fairness to Halle Berry, it must be noted how badly the script, editing, graphics and visual f/x, choreography and the director-- especially the director-- failed her here.

This misfire shouldn't allow us to forget Berry's excellent performances in such films as ""Introducing Dorothy Dandridge"" and ""Monster's Ball,"" for which she deservedly was awarded an Oscar for Best Actress.  The extent of her talent is undeniable and evidenced by the fact that her presence alone can add the necessary spark and elevate the stature of movies like ""Bulworth"" and ""Die Another Day.""  So the million dollar question is, how did she wind up in this embarrassment?  She (as well as the audience) deserves better.  Obviously, she put her trust in the wrong people this time around, and at the top of that list is the ""director"" of this mishmash, Pitof.

I guess the lesson here is that even a major star should be wary when approached with a project that's been placed in the hands of someone whose name sounds like one of those ridiculous vanity plates you try to figure out while sitting at a red light and staring at the car in front of you.  To put this as nicely as possible, Pitof (who? what does that MEAN?) didn't have a clue about what to do with this film, and especially with his actors.  How could this have happened?  He's given all the ingredients (Berry, Stone, Bratt, big budget) to make a prize winning cake and he turns out a lump unfit for consumption.

Add to Pitof's incompetence a laughably bad script (even the ability on the part of the viewer to suspend disbelief won't help with this one), bad editing and exceptionally poor computer graphics and visual f/x that look like something left over from the Stone Age of technology (when Catwoman is bounding and leaping about it has the appearance of an early generation video game; she looks more like a frog than a cat) you have a film that should be expunged from the resumes of everyone involved.

But, like I said, even a bad movie can have a high note if you look for it, which brings me to the only redeeming aspect of this film, the performance by Alex Borstein as Sally, one of Catwoman's co-workers.  Best known as the voice of Lois Griffin in TVs ""The Family Guy,"" Borstein has a charismatic presence that, within the context of this film at any rate, outshines even Berry and Stone.  Better off for all concerned had this movie been titled ""Sally,"" with Borstein given top billing and accordant screen time.

Unfortunately, too, for all concerned, ""Catwoman"" will enjoy it's full nine lives on the shelves of video stores everywhere.  Just keep in mind, when you come to this shelf, pick up ""The Cat's Meow,""  ""The Cat In the Hat,"" ""Cat People."" ""Cat On A Hot Tin Roof,"" or anything with ""Cat"" in the title that isn't followed by ""Woman.""  Take it from me, you'll feel a lot better in the morning.",1121212800,6,3771,4.620689655172414
1189849,1,B0000060X7,"I honestly mean it when I say that ""Catwoman"" is the worst movie I have seen in my life.  It is the lowest of the low.  The absolute bottom of the bucket.  I have seen ""Hypercube: Cube 2"" and ""Battlefield: Earth"" and ""Alone in the Dark"" and ""Plan 9"" (who hasn't?) and even ""Future War.""  Twice.  That's right, I saw ""Future War"" two times the WHOLE way through, and I would still rather do that than watch ""Catwoman"" again.

Often when I say a movie is horrible, it's just hyperbole for the purpose of humor.  But I really mean it when I say this.  If I was to count how many horrible tragedies I would rather suffer than to watch ""Catwoman"" a second time, my head would explode once I realized that the list contained more entries than the number of atoms in the universe.

This movie is sh**.  Utter sh**.  It is the only movie I have ever seen where NOTHING is done right.

I know a lot of people who would probably say that this movie is good if you don't take it too seriously.  But there's a problem with that assumption.  In order for a movie to be good, light-hearted fun, the director has to think of his movie as a popcorn flick.  Not a serious movie.  Popcorn flicks are all about action and quick-paced fun.  ""National Treasure"" is a popcorn flick.  It's illogical and silly, but it's fun because it's breezy and has snappy one-liners and there's a lot of great action scenes.  It's a fun movie because not even the director believes that he is making a realistic or serious movie.  Nobody honestly thinks there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence, so you can lean back and enjoy the show.

""Catwoman"" is much different.  Everything about it is made as if it is meant to be a serious movie.  This isn't meant to be a pocorn flick, it's meant to be an exploration of serious themes like freedom and the conflict between good and evil.  There aren't winks to the audience to let us know that the filmmakers are just playing around---it's just a dead, straightforward movie that is horribly put together.

Let's start with the basic concept:  A superhero with the powers of a cat.  When I think of cats, here are the special ""talents"" that they have/are said to have which a catperson might possess: 1) Exceptional balance.  2) Great jumping abilities.  3) Speed.  4) Quick reflexes.  5) Nine lives.  6) Retractable claws.  7) Mild toxins within the claws.  8) Sharp fangs.  9) Great night vision.  10) Always lands on their feet.

A good cat-based superhero would have most or all of these abilities and be pretty cool for it.  Wolverine has retractable claws and he's pretty awesome, right?  Super-speed, ability to jump---kind of like Spider-man, right?  Night vision, reflexes, these are all great things you could use to have a good Cat Hero.

In ""Catwoman,"" though, we have a superhero who has ""far-sight"" (which I'm not even sure cats actually have, but let's pretend they do) and she uses a whip.  She can also stick onto walls and climb on them like a lizard.  Occasionally she jumps, too, but mainly she climbs on the wall like a lizard.  And she uses a whip.  A whip?!  What the f*** do whips have to do with cats?!  Theoretically she has night-vision, but she uses it only when it's convenient and never at any times when it would make sense.  She has claws, but they're actually fake fingernails that she has glued on to her gloves.  She lands on her feet but only when it's at a time for comic relief.  She has good balance, but only when she's talking on the phone with her friend.  None of her abilities are all that good, and only a couple of them are even remotely cat-like.  Halle Berry isn't the Catwoman that hunts and pounces and strikes when you least suspect it.  She's the Catwoman that eats canned tuna and then sits in the corner licking her crotch.

So, she's not even a Catwoman.  She's a weird-lizard-Furry-woman.  And I haven't even gotten around to describing the movie yet!

Halle Berry.  How you won an Oscar, I'll never know.  You clearly looked to Dustin Hoffman for inspiration and watched ""Rain Man"" many times as research.  And then Pitof told you that all you had to do was shake your booty a bunch and the illusion would be complete.  Seriously, this is the worst performance in any movie I've ever seen.  Berry manages to get every single emotion wrong.  Even when she's playing a corpse, she doesn't look like she's doing a good job.  It's embarassing to watch her.  It's like watching a grown man running around in public wearing only a diaper.

The characters are all irritating, stupid, and wooden.  Cliches all around, from the obese best friend who tells bad jokes to the evil boss who's cheating on his wife and tells bad jokes about her age.  Patience Philips is the only character in the movie with any depth, but unfortunately she doesn't have length and width and must still suffer the shame of being uni-dimensional.

The story is about cosmetics that cause an irreparable skin condition.  You know how the Joker did that in ""Batman,"" and it was actually pretty cool because Jack Nicholson played the role with a lot of flair and the movie was stylistic and fun and didn't take itself completely seriously?  Well, the trouble in Catwoman is that it DOES take itself seriously.  It's one thing to have a plot about killer cosmetics and then throw in some other funny bits to show that the movie acknowledges its own absurdity.  It's another thing altogether to have characters try delivering lines with straight faces that all hinge on KILLER COSMETICS.

The dialogue in this movie?  My god.  Jeff Foxworthy has more sophistication than the scriptwriter of this travesty.  There is not a single good piece of dialogue in the whole movie.  Even simple lines, like, ""How are you?"" are difficult.

It's probably expected that there would be at least one line in the movie where Catwoman says that something is ""purrfect,"" but a good---or even an average---screenwriter would at least try to work it into the story subtly.  In this movie, they don't bother.  Catwoman actually breaks a scene and goes OUT OF HER WAY to say ""Purr-fect"" to remind us that she is, in fact, a CATwoman.  Just in case we forgot.  That's how all of the dialogue is in this movie---it's blunt and obvious and written as if you are a total idiot and can't figure anything out unless the script points it out for you.

There's a scene toward the end of this movie that really symbolizes my outrage at watching ""Catwoman.""  The police are pursuing our lizard-crap-hero through a theater, and she leads them on a chase throughout a network of catwalks above the stage.  There's some sort of odd play going on below, with a bunch of dancers doing stylish things in pink outfits.  The audience looks bored.  Suddenly, Catwoman jumps on the stage and climbs up the curtain to get away from her adversaries, disrupting the play.  The audience cheers and breaks out in applause, really enjoying the show.

This is a stupid audience, easily amused by random crap with no context and a bad actress wearing an unflattering and ugly leather suit.  They are monkeys.  The director thinks of us like that audience.

Under no circumstances should you ever attempt to watch this movie.  I give it zero stars.",1121126400,16,7253,4.602503912363067

Now I will agree with most reviewers that Michelle Pfeiffer is the better catwoman of the two but this movie is not Batman Returns people! In fact, it has nothing to due with Batman period which is probably why it received some negative reviews to begin with. I have not read the Catwoman comics so I don't know if this version of Catwoman is based on them or not. As for the film, it has it's corny moments which I won't spoil for anyone except for the scene that has a cat breathing magic fog into Halle's mouth in order to bring her back to life. Halle also has the moves of Catwoman (truthfully, I don't if it was her or special effects). Anyway, the movie overall in no way drags so you won't get board with it even if you decide you don't care for it. The dvd has good features to offer which is a plus for any movie. Again, I agree that Michelle Pfeiffer IS Catwoman but that's no reason to not give this movie a chance.",1120435200,2,1030,4.180904522613066
1189852,1,B0000060X7,"Where to start, where to start?  ""Catwoman"" is simply horrible, there is nothing in this movie that makes it worth watching, not even Halle Berry.  The story is simple and too stupid to be put into any film, the characters are paper-thin, and the CGI effects work is the worst.  I watched the movie all the way through, hoping it would at some point become interesting, but it never does.  If for some reason you are still interested in what this movie is about then read the next paragraph, if all you want is to read about how bad it is, then skip the next paragraph and read on.

""Catwoman"" of course is based on the character from DC Comics, she is a cat-burglar with an obsession for all things feline (hence the name).  Commonly used as a villain for Batman and at the same time a lover or sorts for Batman.  This movie pretty much ignores everything about Batman, and Catwoman's origins from the comics.  In fact, there are no references to Batman at all in this film.  The story goes like this, Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) works for a cosmetic firm, that is secretly making cosmetics that cause people to deteriorate and therefore, require more makeup from the same company.  Patience discovers this plot and is killed for her discovery, only to be resurrected by cats.  Now Patience has returned to life, but she's more cat-like than human, she likes kitty litter, sleeping on the roof, really stupid stuff that the director and writer probably thought would be cool in the movie but comes off laughable.  Patience eventually turns to crime and dons various costumes to become Catwoman before settling on the final costume which every guy that has seen a commercial or poster for this film knows very well.  It's the bikini top, with shredded leather pants, and a crappy looking mask.  For the most part the moment Halle dons this costume is the best part in the entire film, because this costume really shows off Halle's ""assets"", which is about the only redeeming quality in this film.  Once this happens of course we are led into the final showdown between Catwoman and the villain of the film (I don't remember her name, but she's played by Sharon Stone).  After the fight the movie ends and Catwoman is left roaming the streets hoping to get a sequel, but God-wiling that will never happen, and the audience runs out of the theater threatening to sue the director, who goes by the name ""Pitof"" for stealing 90 minutes of their life away.

The acting in this movie is simply terrible, one would think that Halle Berry being an Oscar winner would do a better job, but of course she didn't have much to work with here.  Really she shouldn't have even chosen to do this film, I mean to go from Oscar winner to this is terrible.  Sharon Stone, who for some reason is shown in this movie with what appears to be a soft glow around her, possibly to hide her wrinkles, is laughable as the villain.  Hopefully Sharon's return to her greatest character, Catherine Tremmel in ""Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction"" will be much better.  Benjamin Bratt as a cop chasing Catwoman and as Patience's love interest is worthless in this film.  The CGI work is beyond horrible, in this modern age of technology and with all of the great special effects used in movies, you would think they would have done a better job.  I mean, it was so obvious every time they used CGI in this film, it was even used for some of the scenes of Catwoman walking around.

Overall, a terrible movie with a beautiful lead actress that should have known better than to say yes to this picture.  I would not recommend watching this movie at all, not even if you are wanting to make fun of a movie, there are plenty of other bad movies that are still watchable that you can make fun of, this one is just not worth the jokes you could throw at it.

If for some reason, you do decide to watch this movie, here is the reason it is rated PG-13.

""Catwoman"" is rated PG-13 for stylized violence, language, and sexuality.",1119571200,3,3989,4.534916201117318

It's a serious good time if you're willing to relax about the idea of Catwoman being a little beyond human. The extra feature on the history of Catwoman is extremely entertaining as well, especially if you're a fan of the old 60's Batman TV show. All-in-all be your own judge.

I like how much more she is actually like a cat than Michele Pheiffer (sp?), but Michele was a MUCH better Catwoman overall.  Again, if you're a comic book buff, avoid this, but if you just want some mindless fun and watching Halle be hot, ck it out.

1189856,3,B0000060X7,"""Catwoman"" was not nearly as bad as I thought it to be.  Considering it won the worst film of the year award from various sources, one can only expect ""the worst"".  The only thing that saves ""Catwoman"" from being a total loss is the ""camp"" value and the ""so bad it's good"" quality that made many a film famous including ""Showgirls"".  Halle Barry has never been an A List actress so you can't really expect much from her, but she does know how to gage her characters to a degree where it's effective but not spectacular.  Sharon Stone enters to add a strange chemistry with Miss Halle and oh NO!, that is when the movie gets really funky and oh so.... CAMPY!! (the word d'jour).  A most meomrable line from the movie that gives this film it's campy kick goes something like ""It's OVER. No......It's over......TIME!!!!!!!. Yeah, you tell em girrl!  Hey, it's better than Avant garde BS like ""Elecktra"".",1117238400,3,900,4.59375
1189857,1,B0000060X7,"For one hour and 44 minutes, even Halle Berry's exotic beauty cannot salvage the credibility of ""Catwoman,"" a comic book-cum-box office joke. The movie was released July 23, 2004, and by some miracle of God grossed $16,728,411 at the weekend box office, almost $2 million more than the sensational ""Spider-Man 2.""

Berry's leather cat-suit seems a bit much (or little), especially the way over-the-top mask, which would hardly keep her identity a secret to Benjamin Bratt's character Tom Lone, the detective she's dating as Patience Phillips and who she continually bumps into as Catwoman. Indeed, Berry is more likeable as the apologetic, forgettable advertising artist Patience Phillips.

Added to the mix is the awkward subplot with Frances Conroy as Ophelia Powers, a former college professor-turned-Catwoman expert. Her house is overrun with cats, including the extraordinary Midnight, an Egyptian Mau, which supposedly is a cat with supernatural powers. To tell the truth, the sight of the adorable, cuddly Midnight almost makes the $5 paid for a student ticket worthwhile. Almost.

In short, this film is a laugh and a half, but was obviously not meant that way. I am thoroughly disappointed that two such credible stars as Halle Berry (""Swordfish,"" ""Monster's Ball"") and Benjamin Bratt (""Traffic,"" ""Miss Congeniality"") would sacrifice their dignity by associating themselves with such a production.

Furthermore, Miss Berry already has a comic book identity. Was ""X-Men"" and ""X-2""'s weather-manipulating, ivory-haired Storm persona simply too credible?

My Rating: One star (out of however many you want: five, ten, five hundred)

The entire focus of the movie was Halle Berry wearing that stupid strip-dancers costume with a mask that had cat ears on it and implied sexual content or sexual content.

The movie had no plot whatsoever (I happen to own pet cats and the movie puts cats name's to shame!), and they changed Catwoman's name from Selena Kyle to Patience Price (also they weren't in Gothom City). Also Benjamin Bratt was a cop in the movie and played Halle's love interest, Sharon Stone played a vain villain who created a facial make up that permanently damages the face.

Halle Berry happens to stumble in on Sharon stone's ploy to keep this from whomever authorizes skin care cream to be on the market and gets killed for it. She then is gifted with special catlike powers by a 1.0000 year old cat that an old lady owns. After being explained what happened to her, Patience (grrr!) goes out and decides to steal a necklace she had her eye on for quiet sometime (she beats up a bunch of crooks in the process), then proceeds to get her revenge on Sharon Stone's lackeys and then Sharon stone herself.

And the CGI in the movie is horrible, Halle Berry's CGI animated self looked plastic and unrealistic. Its a really bad movie that was saying; Cat-women like cops instead of BATMAN!

Even the romance scene was lacking the animal attraction and chemistry between the two characters, making their romance a very forgetable one.

But what bothers me is how repetitious the reviews are; it's like a feeding frenzy where the jaded professional critics pointed out a few flaws and everyone else just jumped on the bandwagon and imitated them.

I like Halle Berry; I enjoyed seeing her in her various personas of shy graphic artist, assertive post-transformation woman, and wild Catwoman.  She's a versatile actor; OK, maybe not the most talented actor out there but she's entertaining and fun to watch, and enjoyably beautiful.

Critics complain that the CGI was cheap looking.  Well, I don't own a Sony PSP so can't compare but it seemed more sophisticated than the average video game I have seen.  The scenery of the city and the jumping over buildings footage could have been made a bit more realistic.  Score one for the critics.

The plot--not so great but not a total disaster.  It was comicbook stuff.  The evil corporate overlords planning, somewhat irrationally, to get women addicted to their toxic beauty cream.  If you stop using it, you get really ugly, and if you keep using it you get skin like living marble.  Silly.  But then, this movie is a fantasy to begin with.  Catwoman doesn't have a monopoly on ridiculous plots; you can shoot a lot of holes in the Spiderman movies as well.

More seriously is that the movie takes itself too seriously.  Had it had more of a sense of humor, like The Mummy, a generally serious movie which is full of hilarious moments, it would probably have earned a bit more respect from the moviegoing public.  This is probably the downfall of Catwoman as a moneymaking franchise.

Her costume--who cares.  This is a comic book movie; of course she's got to wear a sexy outfit.  Who's going to see a Catwoman movie where she's wearing running shoes, a baggy warm-up suit and a ski mask, though arguably more sensible?  I liked the costume.  I'm a healthy male.  What more can I say.

The dialogue--not a strong point but once again, I enjoyed watching Halle interact with people.  I would have liked to see stronger supporting actors and much better written lines.

She was good at fighting.  I don't know how much was Halle and how much was stunt women but it was convincing.

The music--it grew on me.  I'm into folk music; this isn't really my cup of tea.  But it created a sort of light hearted ambience that helped bring the movie up a little bit.

1189869,1,B0000060X7,"You know the old saying, ""Do not change horses mid-race"", well I think that heavily applies to this film.  I think the biggest hurdle that most of us had to overcome in this film was that Catwoman was not Michelle Pfeiffer.  Most of us are still a generation of Batman Returns fans, as well as Tim Burton's darkness, and Halle just couldn't fit those shoes.  Pfeiffer gave us this unbridled performance as this tormented woman who is given a rebirth by some cats, while Berry continually felt as if she was just going through the motions in order to try to be cooler than Pfeiffer was.  You could see the competition going on in the film, and it hurt the overall story and characters.  I will agree, this film had a very weak plot, but with the right person behind the mask of Catwoman, this could have been a decent film.  Sadly, Berry just didn't put the force into it that I felt Pfeiffer did.  There wasn't enough passion in the eyes, just this uncanny ability to act like a cat.  Catwoman was more than ""just a cat"", she was this troubled soul that had to deal with both the good side of her actions as well as the devilish.  That is what never came through with Berry.

Outside of the complete miscast of Halle Berry, there were a couple other points that I just felt cheated after watching the film.  The scene where the cat breaths on Halle was too eerily like Ralph Wiggum's ""My cat's breath smells like cat food"" moment.  I kept waiting to hear that whenever possible.  It would have granted this film one additional star more.  Sadly, we had to live with what was in this film, and not what wasn't.  What was in this film was shoddy acting, a very flimsy script, and scenario after scenario that just didn't seem to work.  I realize the Pitof (the director) was trying to show a very feminine film that could be seen as a feminist picture, but to me it just didn't work.  All of the sudden this cat brings out what Patience couldn't in the past?  Suddenly, with the quick breath of a cat, she could play basketball better than ever, crack a whip, and drive a motorcycle.  There was no development here, just plain assumption.  I needed more development of this character instead of just this light-speed characterization that lead nowhere.

Another element that didn't brood well with me were the villains.  Who were they?  What was their purpose behind their situations?  Without giving us any of this information, we can only assume that they really weren't evil and that perhaps Catwoman was caught up in this big misunderstanding?  I know that is far fetched, but honestly Sharon Stone and Lambert Wilson were not that sinister.  Sure, every company that you work for has that boss that is not going to treat you with the greatest of respect, but does that make him the super-villain?  Then you have Sharon Stone with this pathetic super power that works and doesn't work half the time.  I just didn't care at this point what Catwoman was to do to stop the corporation.  It was this huge dilemma that I could have solved quickly by perhaps incorporating something about the Umbrella Corporation and a tie into Resident Evil 3.  Anything could have been better than what Pitof presented here.

The themes were also as jumbled as a child's playroom.  Scattered throughout this picture you had different themes that never quite tied into the big solution.  There were the feminist issues, the skin care/growing old is ""ok"" theme, the dual personalities and to live life to the fullest moments, and then there was the pro-self sidesteps that just never took us anywhere.  It was like bobbing for themes in this mess.  Nearly every five minutes, Pitof would present to us either a new theme or an older one that should have been dropped, but instead found itself back in the picture.  It became increasingly clear with these scattered themes why Berry couldn't quite capture her character.  There were supposed to be several layers to her character, but instead with all the layers everywhere except on Berry, it became increasingly more difficult to uncover.  This caused both problems for the film itself as well as for the audience forced to sit through this mess.  I mean who wants to visit a place of rest and have to clean up before being able to enjoy it.  Not me, and that is how I felt with this film.  I felt that it was this huge mess that Pitof created and wanted me to clean up.  It was pathetic.

Overall, I was not happy with this film.  Either Pfeiffer should have been in it or it should have been shelved.  With the growing business behind superheroes in today's cinema, Hollywood studios will have to pick and choose which ones they think will be big.  You cannot release them all, and it proves with the attempt to capitalize on this small hero that ultimately failed.  I hate to go with the rest of the critics with this one, but I just did not enjoy the final result.  The costume, the style, the themes, and the acting all put a hinder on this film that was unrepairable from the beginning.  This is a perfect example of a film that should have been scrapped from the beginning instead of rushed to theaters.  Procrastination does not pay off in the long run!

1189870,4,B0000060X7,"To hear some people talk, you'd think this movie was a cross between Ed Wood and Rudy Ray Moore in the field of Bad Cinema. Actually, I found it full of redeeming qualities and quite entertaining.

The story has been discussed, but I actually felt a sense of empathy in the idea of Halle Berry (who I met in Charleston when she was filming ""Queen"" and later in Columbia during ""The Program"") as the overtly insecure Patience finding herself and reaching her true potential as a human being as Cat Woman very appealing. I like the idea of my neices (and hopefully one day my daughters) seeing this ""girl power"" message to identify with. A lot of people could relate to the idea of being very shy and withdrawn and longing for the ability to break free from such emotional confines. How can you not cheer at Halle Berry standing up to her evil boss and the wild partygoers who disturb her sleep?

The biz about the cat ""Midnight"" breathing life to her after her murder and the interlocking of ancient cat mythology is a nice bit of added hokum that makes it entertaining. It's clear that this movie is not taking itself too seriously, a point a lot of people seem to miss.

The actress who plays Halle's boy-crazy buddy who encourages her to take a walk on the wild side is a nice added bit of comic relief.

Plus, you could actually enjoy this movie as a family. The action and fight scenes (I will admit that the constant angle shifts are a bit much) are not of the stomach-turning guts hanging out gross-out variety, there is hardly any cursing, and the sensuality is handled in a classy-not-trashy fashion.

Overall, while it's not a great film, it's a good one. To me, Halle Berry has redeemed herself in my mind from the trashy ""Monster's Ball"" and the stomach-turning ""Bulworth."" You go, girl!",1111363200,3,1798,4.537037037037037
1189871,3,B0000060X7,"""Catwoman"", starring Halle Berry, is one of those movies that has an undeserved reputation for being one of the worst films ever. While it certainly has its problems and could've easily been called something else so it wouldn't look like it was trying to make money off a popular comic book character while changing everything about said character besides the instantly recognizable alias, it really isn't as bad as its reputation claims. At least that is my humble opinion.

""Catwoman"" tells the story of Patience Phillips, a graphics designer in a boring dead end job for the Hedare co-operation, a beauty products company. Her obvious talents are wasted and un-appreciated and she is treated awfully by her stone heart boss. It is only when Patience is murdered and is brought back to life by a magical Egyptian Mao cat that she starts to fight back, righting wrongs and standing up for herself. Guided by the mysterious Ophelia Powers, Patience becomes Catwoman and begins her quest for justice, at the same time dealing with cop boyfriend Tom Lone who is busy hunting down Catwoman.

There are two main problems with ""Catwoman"". One is the direction. The camera angles are all over the place, never staying still for a moment. The director, Pitof, acts like a child trying to show off what they can do and it is irritating and distracting. I believe that with normal direction this movie would be far more enjoyable but here the angles chop and change so much it can literally make one feel dizzy, and it is IMPOSSIBLE to tell what is going on in the action sequences. Also colours that are clearly supposed to be bright and vibrant look washed out and pale, especially during one scene at a fairground. The editing is poor; too, it looks as though the film was majorly hacked into what is apparently the final cut that appears on this DVD.

The second problem is the script. I won't deny that this movie is badly written. The script comes across as very amateur like with many cringe-worthy pieces of dialogue and silly cat related puns. It feels like it was written with little effort or care and it's sad because, with a good script I feel this could've been a much better movie even with the changes made to it's title heroine. I just find it hard to believe that THIS was the best the could come up with.

Yet, thank fully, it still managed to entertain me. I liked it enough to buy the DVD and I don't regret my purchase. The cast help to make the film enjoyable. Halle Berry is fine as Patience Phillips and I feel her ""worst actress"" Razzie award was undeserved. She is confident and comfortable, clearly having a lot of fun with the role and is a joy to watch. Benjamin Bratt is good enough as the standard love interest and has nice chemistry with Berry. Sharon Stone could've been great as Laurel Hedare but was let down by a poor script - her character makes for a lame villain and I never felt any real sense of danger from her. Lambert Wilson isn't much better as George Hedare but I did find myself hating him so I guess he did an okay job. The most annoying member of the cast is Alex Borstein, who's character Sally is given far too much screen time, and dialogue that is clearly supposed to be funny but isn't. Luckily Frances Conroy as Ophelia Powers puts in a great performance and helps to save what could've been an over-all bad cast.

My over-all thoughts on ""Catwoman"" is that it is an enjoyable movie. I do like the Batman comic books, I'm not a fanatic but I collect issues that interest me and I am a big fan of the Selina Kyle character as she is shown in Batman Returns but I went into this movie with an open mind and found that I was able to appreciate the effort. It's a fun, cute movie where you don't have to think too much. Perfect for watching with a big bowl of popcorn and a group of friends. I recommend it.",1111276800,2,3851,4.48005698005698
1189872,1,B0000060X7,"There was absolutely *nothing* believable or credible about this film. At times, Berry as Catwoman was dark - even when fighting her love interest, Benjamin Bratt. Why in the world would she be trying to hurt him? I understand that he was trying to arrest her, but there were better ways for her to escape than by knocking him around. I'm sorry, but donning that mask doesn't change her personality, any more than when Batman puts his mask on his personality changes. Bruce Wayne IS Batman, in suit or out.

Given the films we've seen lately (for example, Spider-Man, 1 or 2), the special effects were heinous. When Catwoman was bounding from wall to wall it you could see the generated effects, and you're not supposed to. Again, especially not today. When Sharon stone fell, at one point in her fall you could actually see that it wasn't a person - it looked like Raggedy Ann dressed in white.

To have a successful movie that involves a comic book hero, you need a good villain, a good plot, and something to care about. This had none of the aforementioned. The villain was a company and it's male C.E.O. trying to market a product that could potentially scar women for life (and what a ridiculous product name that was - Beau-line). Then the villain became his wife. A plot twist? I suppose so, but an entirely ridiculous one. Sharon Stone's character claimed that she had been using Beau-line for years. How is that possible? They're only just now getting ready to release the product. A product goes through years of research and testing, with trial and error, until the formula comes out right. So she's been using it during the research and testing period? Not likely.

The plot - who cared? Did anyone really care about Beau-line? Of course not! I *cared* about the Green Goblin and Doc Ock. I cared about the Joker in the first Batman movie, and definitely about Catwoman in the second (Michelle Pfeiffer, for what it matters, completely outperformed Berry in the role). There was some serious tension between these superheroes and their villains. But how could tension be created through the wiles of a corporation?

Also, how did the mild mannered little girl who was frightened of everything, it seems (but who walked out on a ledge to save a cat - um, duh?) manage to have that revolting leather costume in her closet? Seriously, that was deplorable.

What's very interesting about certain statistics regarding this film is that on pro.imdb.com (the professional version of the Internet Movie DataBase), those who liked the movie most, in each age category, were women. I was surprised, as I thought adolescent boys would be much more interested. Perhaps not enough adolescent boys subscribe to pro.imdb.com.

Also, this movie won 4 Razzie awards: worst actress, worst director, worst picture, and worst screenplay. It was also nominated for three others.

The only reason I rented this was to see how truly bad it was. I think that it may have been worse than I expected it to be.",1110672000,5,2995,4.77027027027027
1189873,3,B0000060X7,"Catwoman - where do I begin? Well, it's not the worst movie, but certainly won't be a movie that I would consider watching again.

The story starts off with Patience Phillips (Halle Berry), a quiet woman, with no self-confidence working in a cosmetics company. She is asked to design a new look for a new product. However, when she goes to meet her boss to return the final draft before midnight, she arrives at the place at a wrong time and sees something she isn't supposed to, leading to deadly consequences. Later, she recovers and acquires new cat-like powers and tracks down her enemies.

Well, let's start off with the plus points of this movie. Halle Berry looks really sweet during the first few minutes of this movie with her long hair while playing the nave Patience Phillips. Even when she gets back at the party people next door (for making too much noise) with her new powers, is nice to watch. However, the whole movie goes downhill when she turns into Catwoman, cuts her hair and wears a disgraceful costume to hide her identity. I have no idea what the costume designers of this movie were thinking; Catwoman is supposed to look sexy and mysterious, but when Halle wears this so-called outfit and uses her whip, she doesn't look, forget graceful, even bearable to watch! Although I wouldn't say she acted her worst in this movie (since none of the other actors acted well anyway), I am definitely baffled as to why she decided to act in this movie in the first place. At least I applaud her for having courage to show up at the Razzies (awards given for the worst films of the year), and accepting her worst actress of the year award with dignity. She can act really well, but she should stop choosing stupid roles for movies like Catwoman and Gothika that could ruin her career.

Another annoying aspect of this movie was the background score/music/soundtrack, whatever you call it. We hear the same background music throughout the whole movie, which makes it really annoying to just watch the scenes. I mean, at least change the music at least in one scene. I feel like I was listening to Mis-teeq's `Scandalous' song throughout the movie. However, I didn't think director Pitof did an extremely terrible job at directing this film, as everyone else says he did. I mean, horrible directing would mean you would have no idea what in the world was going on. The direction was pretty ok, with good special effects, and at least a bit fast-paced. The script on the other hand, well was below average, but not completely despicable.

The last reason as to why I find this movie awkward is because after watching the whole thing, I don't even know whether Catwoman is a good or a bad person. In one scene, she fights robbers who are robbing a jewelry store, and the next minute, she steals the jewelry herself? It doesn't make any sense! Why did the writers even make a script for this movie, if they didn't even know what makes Catwoman special??

I gave this a 3 - star rating, because as I mentioned, I did like the first few moments of the movie before Halle Berry becomes Catwoman and the special effects of this movie. I expected a disastrous movie after reading the reviews of the critics, but it's not THAT bad, even if it isn't that good either.",1110412800,2,3267,4.5969125214408235

The acting in the movie was good, but the story-line was very weak.  It had a lot of potential, but it just wasn't developed properly.

Well i finally saw what some have called the worst train wreck in recent memory. While i can see where some might have a problem with it, ive got to say that i was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It had a rich plot with deep character development. The visuals were amazing and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I never knew what was going to happen next and i couldn't believe how much this movie blew me away. Hallie really prooved how worthy she was of that Oscar!

Now take all that i just said, flip it to its polar opposite, and youll find my feelings for this movie.

Lets see, Patience Prince becomes Catwoman and comes to battles equiped with a whip and cleavage. Got it, cause thats really all there is here.

Wow! Ive got to say that im glad this monstrosoty no longer darkens my dvd player. I had to put it in one last time to see the deleted scenes. I thought perhaps my guests had went through enough torture and didn't want to see any more so we didn't watch them that night. Sorry if anyone wanted to see them, but trust me you missed about as much quality as the movie itself so no worries.

Hmmmm, where to begin. Hallie? Well, she certianly spit out the lines. With about as much talent as a blind person controlling air traffic. Seriously, did she suddenly go retarded? I expected her to pull an Ed from 'Crank Yankers' an express how much she 'Had to go poopie!' Somebody get her a litterbox stat! A friend mentioned she couldn't believe that Hallie got paid 22 million dollars to be in this movie and i corrected her. ""No, they paid Hallies T1+S 22 million to be in this movie.""

Shall we move on to the ""cat"" aspect of this film? Oh i believe we shall! Theres a specific funny/creepy moment that comes to mind ### when Patience gets a ball thrown at her and she starts rubbing it up against her face. As she appears to be close to ""really enjoying herself"" proportions she suddenly stops. The old woman smiles and simply says ""Catnip"". ### And then the old woman says ""Keep going, i was enjoying that."" Not really, but at least it wouldve been funnier than anything else in this movie. Well besides the movie itself that is.

Some of this movie was just plain stupidity that there was no way i could handle. ### Why the need for cgi cats? Batman Returns used real cats for the scene this movie ripped off and that was a couple of years ago! Just because the technology advances doesnt make it right to use it okay? ### And let me tell you a thing or two about Patiences love interest, Cop Guy! ### He has two things she has written 'Sorry' on. One he knew came from Patience, the other he knew came from Catwoman. He takes them to get analyzed by an 'expert' (lets use that term so loosely its in danger of falling off) that says ""Oh theres no way these two people are the same. See this word is timid and this word is angry! Nope nope nope, two different people."" AND THE FRICKEN COP JUST TAKES THAT!!!!!!! ARRRRRGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!! ### Im telling you theres never been a moment in cinematic history that more made me wish id had one of those suicide booths from Futurama.

Final note. I couldn't even stand Alex Borstien in this movie! Thats a gigantic testament to its disgustivity. Unless you go into it fully understanding its something to make fun of, then i wouldnt suggest watching it. I usually try to close with some kind of joke but i...i just cant...

No. This film is a atrocity to filmmakers, and film in general. first of all, the director Pitof probably went into this movie with no creative ideas whatsoever. The acting in this film, was just, in plain terms, horrible. I felt that They seriously took the character of Catwoman, and made her name bad. Also, I feel that the only reason for this film was so that Halle Berry could get into the catsuit, and whip everbody in her way, talk about range. She has been making horrible films lately, I mean, Gothika, Swordfish? She is seriously not taking her Oscar seriously.also, shame on Warner Brothers for taking up this project, They have passed stage one of career sucide.

Overall, this film was a blaspomy to movies, and people in general. This film made us feel stupid for seeing it, and it certianly has not been quite the sucess that the people behind the movie expected it to be. I implore you to not rent or buy this dismal piece of trash that calls itself a movie. It is in desperate need of a good review. Sharon Stone blamed George W. Bush on this movie failing. She said that ""if the lesbian scene wasn't taken out by our stupid president, it wouldn't be the disaster it is."" I pity Sharon Stone, this ""movie"" was a disaster to begin with.",1109203200,4,1389,4.490118577075099
1189878,2,B0000060X7,"First, it is important to know that the main character in ""Catwoman"" is different from the character in the comic book and in the movie ""Batman Returns"".  The main difference is that in ""Catwoman"", she has superhuman strength, speed and agility (which is well shown by the computer imaging).  This is not necessarily a strength or a weakness, but depends on your expectations.  If, for example, you are a fan of the comic, you will likely be disappointed.

Now, for the strengths.  They include some engaging action, some suspense as you follow the main character's uncovering of the bad guy's plot, interesting computer generated imaging of Catwoman's moves, Berry's impressive presentation in her leather costume, and some exploration of the inner conflict between Berry's personas of Patience Phillips and Catwoman.

The movie's weaknesses include an uninspired script, over-use of computer imaging, and silly scenes of Berry acting cat-like (although some of these scenes were cute, most of them did not work, so broke up the flow of the film).

There was potential to make this a very interesting movie by expanding on the psychological issues presented in the contrasting aspects of feminity represented by the main character.  In the comic book, Catwoman represents an empowering figure for women.  She also embodies the conflict between the desire to be sexy and powerful and social and internalized pressures to be meek and obedient.  Exploring these mythic and psychological aspect of the character would not have taken away from the action and would have made ""Catwoman"" a great movie, offering entertainment at different levels.  Unfortunately, the movie failed at this, and ended up mediocre.

In summary, ""Catwoman"" has some good aspects and some bad aspects.  Like any movie, how much you enjoy it depends on things like your expectations, the mood you are in, and your movie preferences.  If you do not expect too much and want to see some action with a mild to moderate amount of character development, then you will enjoy the movie.  If you get hung up on the dry script, lack of depth, exaggerated effects, and unfulfilled potential then you probably will not like the movie.",1109116800,2,2194,5.089385474860335
1189879,2,B0000060X7,"First of all, I'd like to say that ""Catwoman"", although not a good film by any means, isn't the worst superhero movie I've ever seen. In fact, I'd argue that last year's ""Daredevil"" was worse. This film isn't horribly acted or directed; it's just ill-conceived, with a shabby premise and a mediocre script.

Instead of spinning off the Selina Kyle character wonderfully adapted from the comics (and brilliantly played by Michelle Pfeiffer) in ""Batman Returns"", the masterminds behind ""Catwoman"" made the decision to create a brand new Catwoman character, this one with actual superhuman, cat-like powers and abilities. The result is that this film not only betrays the built-in fan base of comic book fans, but fails to deliver an interesting or exciting substitute for catburglar Selina Kyle.

Halle Berry tries hard to rise above the material, and she does a fairly good job at playing both mousy graphic designer Patience Phillips and feisty, sexy Catwoman. And given the right material, Sharon Stone, icy and diabolical, could have been a wonderful villianess. It's just that both actresses are doomed by the script, premise, and in Halle's case, RIDICULOUS costume design.

This movie should serve as a warning for the film studios: When adapting a film from a comic book, it's okay to take slight liberties to make the film work, but if you completely betray the original creation, you're doomed to failure.",1108944000,2,1413,5.081896551724138

Last time I checked, cats do not possess that particular ability.  Her debut in the jewelry store was hilarious.  We couldn't stop laughing ... and I don't think that's what the director had in mind.

1189885,3,B0000060X7,"3 1/2 stars. I realized with a smile about 20 minutes into ""Catwoman"" that it was actually an alright movie. Not quite worthy of 4 stars, but almost there. It doesn't have the best acting, and some of the CGI is a little cheap looking, but over-all, this isn't a terrible movie. People may have told you that this a truly terrible movie, like people told me, or they may have said that it was great. There is no in-between with this one. I may be the only exception! This film deserved more recognition than it got, and it also deserved a bigger audience. The box office was dismal (opening on the same day as ""The Bourne Supremacy"", this movie grossed 13 million less in its entire run than ""Supremacy"" got in its opening weekend) and the reviews were terrible, but I liked it and I do not know why. The acting is actually alright, as is the production value and the plot, but like I said earlier, it messes itself up in the visual effects department. When there should be a relatively real looking image of a person leaping from a building onto a motorcycle, we see a distorted frame that looks like it was lifted from the ""Spitrix"" (what I call things that look like a combination between ""Spiderman"" and ""The Matrix""). But that doesn't really matter since there are less than a handful of those scenes. There is, however, a scene about an hour into the movie in a nightclub that is impossibly stupid, and I actually found myself laughing. This unfortunate scene almost ruined the movie for me.

The violence in the movie is surreal and almost addled with craziness as the film slowly conjeals into one long 45 minute chase/shootout/smackdown. Some of the films romantic scenes and aspects between the Benjamin Bratt and Halle Berry characters are sweet, but at some points a little too suggary for the films context of revenge and dark betrayl. The ferris wheel sequence, for instance, is the perfect example of how the film moves too many genres into a single scene. One minute there is a little love going on, and then there seems to be a person in need of rescuing.

The setup is something that everyone should know, hopefully, at this point. Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) is a graphic designer working at an advertising agency. One night, while delivering an add, Patience hears something that was not meant for her ears. So she is killed and thrown into the ocean. When she awakes the next morning, she realizes that she can leap onto the rafters of her apartment. This is an interesting part of the movie, as Patiences apartment looks like that of a celebrities and not a graphic designer. But anyway, Patience decides to avenge her death, and she does so, along with starting up a steamy relationship with a cop, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt). Their relationship takes a turn for the better when Tom gives Patience a clearer understanding of her duties as a Catwoman, even though he is oblivious to the fact of who she is.

The final action sequence is amazing and worth the 1:35 minute build-up. The final scene, however, left me wanting more. I know that knowone else has said this, and knowone else probably will say this, but I want a sequel.

Rating Evaluation: None (Scenes never happen). Mild (Scenes happen two or fewer times). Moderate (Scenes happen at least a few times). Heavy (There are many scenes  throughout the movie). Extreme (Scenes are continuous from beginning to end in the movie).

Violence: Heavy: (Several bloody shootings, a nonlethal though bloody stabbing, fist fights, and a falling death).

Profanity: Moderate: (Not many strong usages, but a few usages of tamer words).

Sex/Nudity: Mild (One scene that is quite understated).

Drugs/Alchohol: None.",1108252800,2,3689,4.742589703588144
1189886,2,B0000060X7,"This film should have been better. It has a decent cast. Sharon Stone and Halle Berry are both good actresses. Benjamin Bratt is generally a bit of a stock good-guy type but he's always relaxed enough to be convincing. The plot is perfect comic book material (which means it's right over the top with its insidious nature) and the 'look' given to the film is just larger enough than life to blend real with surreal.

The problems start when the actors open their mouths. Benjamin Bratt is around to serve as a love interest, period. His job is to look good and smile or grimace at the right times. Sharon Stone's character has no depth at all. It just hisses (or coos patronizingly) according to the demands of the script. Lambert Wilson's character presents the face of corporate arrogance and nothing else. Both characters have no depth whatsoever. All they do is portray irredeemable evil that's varied only by gender code.

Halle Berry fares only slightly better. She makes an alluring Catwoman and a demure figure as the character's alter ego but her role is severely limited as well. One side is soft and the other is hard. With only a few exceptions there's no middle ground in her character's duality. This has to be a studio decision. Writer Theresa Rebeck (Law and Order) is a far better writer than this and both Stone and Berry are far better actresses as well. Whatever the reasons for the lack of depth given to the characters, the film suffers for it.

The film has other problems as well. A lot of the CGI appears to have been done in haste. The lighting effects that can be generated in 3D rendering are just lacking here. It makes the CGI sequences look like the hi-tech cartoons that they are. The soundtrack tries too hard to be hip and (at times) distracts from the film as opposed to enhancing it. Too much of the story is entirely predictable and the silhouette that closes film is unintentionally funny because of the action that precedes it.

Catwoman isn't a complete loss. Even with the problems it has the film is still easy enough to sit back and enjoy. Unfortunately, there's seldom a moment where it doesn't seem as if it could be a lot better.",1108252800,,2175,4.597938144329897

There were so many bad things about this movie that I can't even list them all. The acting by all 3 leads is terrible, especially Sharon Stone who basically made a fool out of herself with this role. The dialogue is horrendous and laughable. Catwomans costume is rediculous, and the fight sequences, especially between Halle Berry and Sharon Stone is just laughable. Why oh why would the people working on this fil think it was worth anything. It's terrible. The only saving grace is Frances Conroy who brings some type of life to her role as the one who explains who Catwoman is. I enjoyed her scenes, and that would be it.

1189890,3,B0000060X7,"I had bad expectations of this film after hearing last summer how widely panned it was and based on the trailer, which didn't really make this film a ""must see"" for me.  I'm glad I waited, though it wasn't nearly as bad as I expected, and it could stand to be a lot better.

First of all, choosing Halle Berry for the latest incarnation of Catwoman was the best decision the producers could make.  She makes a perfect Catwoman and does a great job.  Her costume is better than the one Michelle Pfeiffer used in ""Batman Returns"", though I still didn't like her mask.  Halle Berry is the best thing about this movie, especially with her whip appeal and sexy moves.  One scene I like in particular is the basketball game between Detective Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) and Patience Phillips (Halle Berry), with the hip urban groove music matching the flow and rhythm of the game, which is more a physical flirtation between the two than an actual game.  This occurs when Patience is just learning about her new dexterous style.

Now, for the bad...which is nearly everything else about the film.  The plot is flimsy and reminiscent of the first Tim Burton ""Batman"" film...cosmetics that does more harm and requires continuous use to prevent the scars on one's face.  Patience Phillips is a mousy commercial artist who is so timid and afraid of the boss (played by Lambert Wilson, best known as the Merovingian of the two ""Matrix"" sequels and essentially plays the same role in this film) that she takes his abuse and scorn.  Sharon Stone plays the wife of Monsieur Hedere, who's every bit as schemeing as her husband, though a bit more deadly.  This leads to the inevitable ""cat fights"" between Halle Berry and Sharon Stone.

Someone complained about Patience Phillips being a mousy lady, but that's the point, at least with Selena Kyle (the original alter-ego of Catwoman).  The transformation of a mousy lady into a fierce, feline, femme fatale is the whole point about Catwoman and the empowerment of such a role.  That's why Patience is ""mousy"" at first.  What bothered me most about this film is Patience's sidekick, a white co-worker who practically pushes Patience on a date with Detective Tom Lone, and who wants the scoop on every little detail.  It was especially a cringe-worthy moment to hear this plumpy, dumpy white woman tell Patience, ""give me my props!"" and trying to act hip and cool.  It totally rang false.  The whole friendship between the two of them didn't see authentic, but was a mere contrivance to give Patience a friend that plays a semi-important role for the purposes of dialogue.  Now about that dialogue...very cliched and cheesy (such as Catwoman grabbing hold of a baddie's tongue and then saying, ""cat got your tongue?"").  The film is full of horrendous dialogue.

Another complaint about the film is that too many scenes took place in industrial buildings.  It was just unoriginal and not very exciting.  It lends a sort of ""been there, done that, seen that"" blase to the whole film.  There's really nothing in here that screams to be seen, that just wows you the way the two ""Spider-man"" films do.  That movie has heart, this one doesn't.  My final critique is that the background music was often annoyingly distracting and didn't fit the scene (except for the basketball one-on-one game).  The people who made this film either tried to hard or didn't try hard enough...its not very original, exciting, or worth the money and time spent on it.  Halle Berry as Catwoman is the only good thing about this film and she makes it worth watching at least once.  Take her out of the equation and the film is third-rate, first draft stuff that should never have been given the greenlight.  Because this film bombed, there's little chance that a better made sequel will ever get made, which is a shame.  There's so many things one can do with a Catwoman film, but this film isn't it.",1107820800,4,3904,4.729289940828402

My favorite scenes were the ones w/the cats.  Sharon Stone was wonderful as the villian; kudos to her after her stroke.  Halle Berry and Benjamin Bratt were also fine, and the chemistry between them kept me interested.  The main problem I had was her costume.  Could she be wearing any less?  And running in heels?  Forget it!  I do recommend this as a fun, not-to-take-serious movie night.  Make some popcorn, grab your cat, and enjoy!",1107734400,2,603,4.440366972477064

Berry's performace has none of the passion or tortured psychology of this classic Batman hero/villian.  The rest of the cast is laughable at best.  Sharon Stone proves once again that she is nothing more than a pretty face (and even that is questionable these days); Benjamin Bratt was totally miscast.  The producers of this film had the opportunity build upon the excellent portrayal of Catwoman by Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns, but fail miserably.  This movie doesn't even compare to the campy performances of Julie Newmar, Lee Meriweather, and Eartha Kitt in the 1960s TV show.

1189893,3,B0000060X7,"This movie is not great, but it is not awful either. I've seen films that are MUCH worse. You see, Catwoman used to be just another colorful Batman villian, a simple jewel thief with a costume, until writers at DC decided to make her a romantic interest (bye-bye Ertha Kitt, hello blonde bombshell Michelle Pfieffer)  which spawned the ""Birds of Prey"" comic and TV show.

Now Halle Berry and director Pitof (I guess Dieter was busy) take a crack at putting Catwoman on the silver screen, delving into the whole quasi pro-feminist, Egyptian mythology based history behind this shallow comic character. I give them points for trying. The main villain is played by Sharon Stone, an evil cosmetics magnate who plans to sell bad makeup to the masses. It confirms my opinion: Sharon Stone cannot act but marries well.

Yes, Halle Berry is grade-A hoochie material enhanced by the leather Catwoman costume (personally, she looks hotter in her Ororo X-Man costume) but SHE can act, which helps this film. Department store dummy Benjamin Pratt shows up as the love interest - YAWN...

The fight scenes are OK, boarderline bad but I have seen worse (the last Batman film for example). Catwoman is worth a look, but buying it wouldn't be a great idea.",1107561600,2,1240,4.807511737089202

1189896,5,B0000060X7,"Most underrated Movie ever comes on an excellent Blu Ray Disc

Plot: Halle Berry plays a shy designer who overhears something she wasn't supposed to hear and the bad guys (and girl) try to kill her. Of course they don't succeed fully, because otherwise it would be a really short movie. So, floating in water, she is rescued by some cats and given quasi superhuman powers.
Now she tries to bring the evildoers to justice, save a bunch from people getting seriously ill from using a bad product and have some fun along the way.
Even though I compressed the story in a few lines this is way more plot than current blockbusters like ""Transformers"" or ""G.I. Joe"" offer.

PQ: The PQ in this movie is simply excellent. I really couldn't find a thing wrong with it. The picture is crystal clear and very sharp even though there was clearly NO Edge Enhancement or DNR used. Blacks are really black. Really this is one of the best PQ I recently encountered on a BD

SQ: The TrueHD Soundtrack (which usually hovers around 7mbit/s) is also extremely good. Dialogue is always very crisp and understandable even if a lot goes on in the back. Directionality is very good. Bass is not overused but when they call for it, man it delivers.

Extras: Not much there, just a featurette , some deleted scenes (including an alternate Ending)

Summary: THIS IS REALLY A GREAT MOVIE. WHY? IT HAS A SOLID PLOT, GREAT ACTING, VERY GOOD PRODUCTION VALUES. Well what more can I say.. The whole movie seems like an artpiece and one should not dismiss it just because some people didn't get it.

For the record, the Live Action Catwomen are: Julie Newman, Lee Meriwether (the first movie, everyone forgets her), Eartha Kitt, Michelle Pfeiffer, and alas, Halle Berry.

The work that they did on cat movement and Halle's work in mimicing them was a treat to watch and it was a rare treat to see an ancient religious belief treated with respect.

1189899,1,B0000060X7,"Released in July of 2004, Catwoman was destined to become a box office bomb after receiving slews of terrible reviews.  Nearly every critic in the business blasted Berry, Bratt, and everyone else involved in this lackluster attempt at an action film.  Though their words scratched deeper than any cat claws could, nobody can adequately describe how truly awful this film really is.

Mousy aspiring artist Patience Phillips (Berry) spends her days creating advertisements for beauty products.  The rulers of this beauty empire, supermodel Sharon Stone and her egomaniacal husband, are callous and cruel to their employees; and big shocker, they're hiding a dark secret.  It seems the new face cream they're hawking causes some major medical issues.  Unwilling to take a hit to the pocketbook, they cover it up.  That is until poor Patience discovers their dirty secret while working late one night.  After being flushed out a drain pipe, she is rescued by a group of felines and is reborn as Catwoman.  What insues is a laughable farce of a movie, featuring bad acting, bad jokes, and poorly-produced special effects.

Oscar winner Berry rambled on and on at the Academy Awards about how she was paving the way for black actresses in America.  Well, with Catwoman, she paved the way right down the toilet.  While undeniably attractive, she quite simply does a poor job with the role.  Benjamin Bratt seems clueless as the detective tracking Catwoman, and Sharon Stone simply looks bored; as if she showed up just to collect a paycheck.

The lone highlight of Catwoman is the radio friendly song ""Scandalous"" sung by British pop trio Mis-Teeq.  Otherwise, leave this one in the pan with the kitty litter.

Where to begin?  Bad direction.  Never trust a director with a one name monicker(i.e. McG of ""Charlie's Angels:Full Throttle"" fame).  Pitof seems to have gotten his start in making bad music videos and translated it to the big screen.  Bad script.  The writers of this drivel have never met a cat joke it couldn't resist.  My personal fave is when Halle is revived from the dead by the cats it looks like she's coughing up a hairball.  Bad acting.  Halle looks ridiculous playing the frump at the beginning and doesn't have a clue as to how to play Catwoman.  The best part of her performance is when she sports the leather catsuits.  The gymnastics are impressive but it's obvious that they were done by stuntdoubles and computer graphics.  Sharon Stone is not entering middle-age gracefully.  She comes off more shrill than villainous.  Only Benjamin Bratt as Halle's cop boyfriend escapes this fiasco with any dignity.  I would give this film one star but I don't truly hate it.

Its pretty sad that just anyone can have a movie made these days, and take advantage of the already existing fan base by conjuring up a lame shallow version of a character that someone spend ALOT of time and energy and love building via comics.  Wu-Tang said CREAM (cash rules everything around me).  This is soooo true.  And it rules to the detriment of creativity.  A marble-faced villain who gained her powers from moisturizer?  Sharon Stone's career must be hurting right about now to accept this role. A cosmetic company out to rule the world? I'd buy resurrection by cat breath before L'Oreal global domination. Hey, did anyone see the similarities between this and the original Batman (Tim Burton) story?  Cosmetics driving people mad?  Very very unoriginal. At least Tim Burton made it cool.

I'm not sure who this director Pitof is, but someone should smack the hell out of him.  He had almost no vision. And someone should smack the folks at DC comics for selling Bob Kane's creation to the highest bidder - Halle Berry.  Speaking of Halle again, I really don't respect her as an actress these days.  Her performance in Monster was overrated (make me feel goooooood!!!).  Her portrayal of Dorothy Danridge was pretty shallow.  Anybody see Rich Man's Wife?  Exactly my point.

1189905,3,B0000060X7,"Halle Berry has certainly got the look (and ""got milk?"" in one fun scene), in this attempt to bring the marvel character up to date, but sadly that's about it. The most recent comparison would of course have to be Michelle Pfeiffer as the leather clad feline fighter in Tim Burtons Batman Returns, and whereas I understand characters must evolve with the times, they should not be changed altogether. Pfeiffer and Burton came close to encapsulating the multi faceted role, whereas this time around the production team and director seem to have missed by a mile. Ms Berry plays Patience Phillips, a Plain Jane artist, seeking her inner self, and trapped working for a large cosmetic conglomerate as a designer. She overhears something bad about the companies latest product and is dispatched forthwith, by the villainous Sharon Stone, as wife to the head of the company. Reborn with the aid of a mystical Egyptian Mau cat, and a seemingly all wise ""little old lady"" she emerges as Catwoman, and sets about bringing her erstwhile foes to justice, and in so doing discover her true self. The visual distraction of her in a costume that would have fried the censors back in the 60's may be enough for adolescents, or the less demanding viewer, but this is a pretty poor attempt really. The darkness and depth of the Marvel creation is never seen, as Ms Berry plays out a little girl lost turned Vigilante with a muddled ambivalence. Staying well inside the Politically Correct (PC) line, she is almost shown as a goody two shoes, reluctantly playing a part and keeping everyone happy, rather than getting inside the storybook character. Another BIG complaint for me is the CGI fusion with live action. Much like the ""Blade"" movies, seeing a cartoon computer overlay scramble up walls, flip, turn, jump and perform inhuman stunts doesn't work I'm afraid, even if you do seemlessly match it with the actor in places. Even impressive SfX should compliment a films story,  NOT try and carry it altogether. There are some nice extra's on the DVD however, and the story is not too ridiculous. The supporting cast are sound, and the visuals OK, but you keep feeling that the script writer and director should have taken the plunge a little more, rather than just dipping their toes into an Iconic character such as they have here.

First of all, this is basic comic book fare.  Therefore those of you expecting a Masterpiece Theatre production should get a grip.

Of course the plot may not have been overwhelming.  But neither was it in Superman, Spider Man, Hellboy, Hulk, or Spider Man II for that matter.

And why would Halle attach herself to a project such as this?  There are infinitely more important intangibles here at work.

How many young girls of color ever get to have such a beautiful, award-winning actress, of color, personify the empowerment of women?  I submit that Catwoman is a wonderful exercise in showing how pivotal one's blossoming can be - the movie also addresses the dilemma of accepting responsibility for one's own actions as well an interesting foray into choosing good over evil (or vice-versa).

Of course I have seen movies with better plots, tighter screenplays, more inticate direction, more elaborate sets, blah, blah, blah.

One thing is certain:  NONE of them have Halle Berry slinking up and down the street as Catwoman, the LAST Dominatrix, so sexy and fectching and just plain WORKIN' NERVES!!!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, it just doesn't get much better than THAT!!!!!

The movie was fun. Did it need (or purport to be) more than that? I daresay any of the other recent comic book adaptations provided much more either and yet critics were infinitely kinder.  No matter.  The nature of the beast.

Catwoman is a dark character, not a camp, badly scripted joke. Her outfit is ridiculous - as if she could jump around with that horrific ensemble on ""certain things would pop out"" not to mention she has four ears. I am so glad that they changed her name from the comic book character Selina Kyle which I as a huge Catwoman fan loves. Michelle Pfeiffer played the role of Catwoman perfect in Batman Returns, to think that anyone would even try to step into her stilleto's is a joke, but this film is just a complete insult to the audience. It gives us cat owners a bad name. Halle berry should definetly be put out with the kitty litter, in the end I wanted Sharon Stone to whip out an Icepick and kill her.

1189911,4,B0000060X7,"Ok i'm just going to cut right to the chase, and try to make this short. It's easy to read anyone of the negative reviews and think ""CATWOMAN"" is a bust! however, it is anything but. Growing up I was a huge fan of ""Batman Returns"", and when i heard WB was given the green light to create a seperate ""Catwoman"" project, i was thrilled. Michelle did an amazing job with the Catwoman Daniel Waters had created, and Tim Burton had invisioned. Not only was she pschologically dark, but the emotional rollercoaster she endured was unlike any seen before in a ""comic book"" based film. Michelle's selina kyle was a great love interest for Michael Keaton's bruce wayne. Their Romeo & Juliet style relationship fuels this stylish and sleek film. As many of us know the last frame in ""Batman Returns"" features Michelle's Catwoman rising up infront of the beautifully lit bat signal. With that aside the excitment and anticipation for the solo ""Catoman"" film got underway. Michelle was ready to get back into the role, as was Tim Burton...however, Michelle became pregnant and decided to choose family over film. I commend her for putting her family first. As the years went on actress after actress was in line to reprise Selina Kyle, but no one nailed it like Michelle. With everything working against them Warner Brothers was dumbfounded at what to do. Cancel the project, or continue onward. In 2001 things brightend up when Ashley Judd was on board... not as selina kyle but as Patience Price. This time there would be no batman. There would be no Gotham City. The original script involved Patience working for a ruthless politician who would strive at nothing to gain power. The script would be reminicent of Daniel Waters, Time Burton, and Frank Miller's bleak vision on the Femme Fetale. After months in limbo without a director Ashley and Tim Burton moved on to other projects. It would be another year and a half and two more actresses before it fell in the hands of Pitof! Nicole Kidman and Gweneth Paltrow were reportedly in the running of the title role, ultimatley the part went to 2001 oscar winner...Halle Berry. Halle expressed her excitment for taking on the role, and promised a fresh new look on the character of catwoman. However, the smart, edgy, sophisticated, and to my mind inventive script concept was dropped. Rumors swirled that Berry was not pleased the Warner Brothers decided to go with a new apporach and abandon the idea of Patience Price working under the ruthless politician. Still she wanted to portray ""Catwoman""! When the new script came in about beauty cream that can kill, many thought are you for real, but they quickly realized that in 1989 Tim Burton used that same idea for ""Batman"". So realizing that the film was ago. If you are still reading this i commend you! haha...Now i understand many of you were not pleased with the end result that was ""CATWOMAN"", but i urge you to go in with an open mind. Yes it's EXTREMELY CAMPY and colorful and predictable, but the one thing this movie does that no other Incarnation of CATWOMAN has done is make the audience feel empowered! I was actually pleased with the end result. It's campy pop corn fun, but the underline subtext is what did it for me. Halle Berry brings new bite to Catwoman in a way that Michelle could never. Michelle's catwoman was deranged and confused, and very very tormented. Halle's is fun, sexy, and empowered within herself. At the end of the day you can hate this movie and beat it down, but i urge you to enjoy it for what it is. The music is hot, the acting is campy, the visuals are animated and bright, the sets are colorful, and the story is airy! but the overall message is FREEDOM is POWER, and EMPOWERMENT lives inside yourself. BE YOURSELF! so at the end of the day Michelle and Halle each brought something different to the character of catwoman. I don't think one is better then the other. One is dark One is light. One is emotionally distraught, and one is emotionally empowered. You decide.",1106438400,4,4004,4.680851063829787

1189914,2,B0000060X7,"There is universal agreement that Halle Berry is a beautiful woman, and after winning the Academy Award for ""Monster's Ball,"" she has the bona fides of a legitimate actress.  Hiring Berry to play ""Catwoman"" makes sense, because there is a tradition of the character being sexy and smart going all the way back to the campy ""Batman"" television series where Julie Newmarr and Eartha Kitt essayed the role of the felonious feline.  But when it becomes clear in this 2004 film that the primary emphasis of Halle Berry as Catwoman is on her breasts, then I think it is clear this movie has lost definitely its focus on what makes Catwoman work.

Catwoman first appeared in the final story in ""Batman"" #1, when she was simply the Cat (a.k.a. Selina Kyle), the world's greatest cat burglar.  She was devoid of superpowers, although she certainly employs her many cat-like qualities to her advantage.  She walks the line between being good and bad, which explains why she is so attractive to Batman, since the Dark Knight's vigilantism has him walking that thin line as well.  But in this story/screenplay by Theresa Rebeck, John Brancato & Michael Ferris, and John Rogers neither Selina Kyle nor the Batman make an appearance.  For fans this becomes the obvious place to point a finger and start wagging it disparagingly.

In this incarnation Berry plays Patience Phillips, a talented commercial artist who designs print advertisements without a shread of self-confidence at H&H, a cosmetics company run by the husband and wife team of George (Lambert Wilson) and Laurel Hedare (Sharon Stone).  Laurel has been the face of the company since its inception, but now she is being replaced by a younger face, and she is not at all happy about this changing state of affairs (you have to think this plot is hitting really close to home for Stone).  There are some rather serious problems with the cosmetics H&H is putting out, and when Patience stumbles across something she should not see in some place she should not have been, she is killed.

When Patience is murdered she comes back to life after Midnight, a cat whose lineage goes back to the cat gods of ancient Egypt, breathes the power of Catwoman into her.  But even though there is Ophelia Powers (Frances Conroy), a character who exists to provide Patience with the necessary background information, there is no real point beyond the exposition.  Usually when someone is granted superpowers like this, from another being, there is a mission statement.  Instead, what we get is a checklist of cat powers as more of an instructor's manual.  Since Patience was murdered, Catwoman has a reason to do something about that, although it does not seem too much of a pressing concern to her.  But there was an entire history lesson shown behind the opening credits and you would think it would actually lead to something significant in the film itself.

When this Catwoman steals some jewels, it seems just a nod to the comic book character, and not a serious bit of motivation.  Instead of a bad girl who sometimes does good things, what we have is a woman dealing with a split personality.  At this point I was reminded that the idea for a ""Catwoman"" movie was first floated after Michelle Pfeiffer's turn in ""Batman Returns,"" which would explain the character's personality disorder.  But while this makes sense when Catwoman/Selina Kyle is faced with Batman/Bruce Wayne, it has no resonance with the lead character is dealing with a cop, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt).  He sees the world in black and white terms, while Catwoman works best as a gray character.  But in this film she is bouncing back and forth between Patience and Catwoman without any rhyme or reason that resonates with the audience.

Catwoman's final costume, the infamous dominatrix outfit, is wrong for the character and actually extremely unflattering to Berry.  Why anybody would want to make a movie with Halle Berry and make her look bad is beyond me, but this film manages to do it.  I also think the character worked better with the long hair along with the full-body suit, which did not have to be made of leather.  Then, to cap off the string of disappointments, we have the climatic cat fight between Catwoman and Laurel, whose use of cosmetics has had an interesting side-effect that could have been taken advantage of in the big fight but was not (because that would have made sense).  Still, given that the film is devoid of thrilling stunts or memorable one liners, it is not surprising that it is a complete failure across the board.

Of the DVD extras the best of the bunch is the retrospective on the character of Catwoman, narrated by Eartha Kitt, who does the best purr in the history of the world.  Watching the documentary it becomes clear that all of the actresses who have played Catwoman have had both a better respect for and a better understanding of the character than those who put together this film.  The irony that ""Catwoman,"" one of the worst comic book movies of all time, came out the same summer as one of the very best, ""Spider-Man 2,"" is not lost on those of us weaned on comic book superheroes.  Hopefully the people who are doing the next Batman movie will have figured out which of those two to hold up as a role model.",1106438400,12,5269,4.750823271130626
1189915,4,B0000060X7,"It has Halle Berry displaying a lot of Halle Berry. If you're a fourteen year old boy, or were one, that's probably enough. She doesn't display too much though - mothers of those boys need not worry.

The action is strong and bloodless, the minor romantic themes are chaste, and Berry defeats the evil empress of the beauty products empire. (I did say this was a comic book, right?) Some of the ""cat"" scenes are laugh-out-loud funny, like falling off the shelf.

The effects are generally good, and the CGI cats are surprisingly good. It's competent and well made, of its sort, but probably not one for the ages. Well, they don't all have to be. It's a great popcorn movie.

Sure, the graphics could have been better, but I've watched pretty much every single movie that has been out for rent recently and it stands out as one of my favorites.",1106352000,13,338,4.365079365079365
1189918,4,B0000060X7,"I didn't have a chance to see this movie when it came out in theaters but didn't think I missed out on much because most said this was a horrible film. After seeing it, I'm not sure what all the complaints and talk were about. This isn't Oscar worthy or cutting edge like one of the 80s ""Superman"" flims but it is not as bad as, say, ""The Hulk.""

First, this isn't based on the Catwoman that appears in the ""Batman"" series. It's based on the character as she is seen in the independent series. It doesn't take place in Gotham, it doesn't rely on any nods or ties to ""Batman"" and that comic book series. Perhaps that makes it hard for people to accept.

The movie starts off a bit slow. You aren't confronted with action and her big transformation until a little bit into the movie. The movie takes the time to establish who this character is; where she came from, the problems she faces in her ordinary life, what leads to her transformation. Then, unlike many comic book genre movies, it seems to try to be more realistic and base Catwoman in historic terms. These parts are a little slow and dragging, but they are essential. There are some interesting things established that sets ""Catwoman"" apart from other films like it. There is a nod to the ""Batman"" franchise; you can see a photo of Michelle P.'s Catwoman from ""Batman Returns.""

There are some rather cheesey script moments but it doesn't take away from the story all that much. Berry really got into the role of ""Catwoman."" She seemed to struggle in the early scenes before she's undergone her transformation but it doesn't take much time for her to put a spin on the Catwoman role. There are some parts in the film where you can see some unscripted moments; parts where she is fully into the mind-set of this character that isn't restrained and doesn't know where her place is in the world. The parts where she did her own stunts (you can watch these in the special features) makes the film even better. The computer generated Catwoman isn't great (you can tell this isn't close to being a real person) but it is not as bad as the computer generated Hulk from a few years back.

The supporting actors like Benjamin B., Sharon Stone, and Berry's friend in her office are all at the top of their game. The story may be predictable in some parts, but there are many unexpected moments and scenes that are all very interesting and worthy of a little praise.

This is not an award-winner but it is far from the worse film ever made. I think people came into this expecting another ""Monster's Ball"" performance but hey, it's ""Catwoman."" It is meant to be a little fun, a little comic-booky and quite different from most films. There's action and some really amusing scenes. Berry obviously invested herself into this film and adds a little range to her character. This is in no way a continuation of the character that appeared in ""Batman Returns"" but the film does a good job in creating and establishing a unique and original Cat-woman. The main conflict is something a bit different as well; Catwoman takes on a woman in her 40s who (like many in Hollywood) is facing the end of her career due to her age.

This is a film worth watching and is far from being as bad as some of these reviewers have said it to be. Come on, not every film is going to be Academy Award winning and it shouldn't be held up to high standards just because the leading actress in it won an Oscar for a previous film. Give it a chance, you'll probably enjoy it.",1106352000,4,3495,4.453125
1189919,1,B0000060X7,"Oh boy, where to start.  There were several big budget spectacles that got critically(and commercially)massacred  during 2004(VAN HELSING, ALEXANDER, etc.), but I'm sorry to say that none deserved said ravagings more than CATWOMAN, a pale, soulless attempt at refashioning the comic book heroine/villainess that fails miserably on so many levels that it's hard to know where to start with regard to placing blame.

For one, I'm not sure what poor Halle Berry was thinking when she read the threadbare script--was it actually once-upon-a-time decent and at some point re-written into the careless,  sophomoric bird cage liner(or for that matter litterbox liner)that ultimately ended up on screen?  Nothing about the characters or story are fleshed out--there is absolutely no rooting value or any remote reason as to why we or anyone would care about these characters--any sympathy offered by the audience is strictly for the poor actors who had the misfortune of being led to believe that this was actually a workable script.  As such, Berry doesn't stand a chance in the title role, and her straining attempts to get some grasp of the character just reinforces the brilliance of Michelle Pfeiffer's definitive take on the character in BATMAN RETURNS(and makes one truly wish that the initial concept of a Catwoman film with Pfeiffer had actually seen fruition).  Unfortunately, Berry isn't the only one lost here--Benjamin Bratt surfaces in his upteenth role as the boyfriend/love interest/straight female-gay male eye candy and basically sleepwalks(again)through a role that actually doesn't require much more than that, while Lambert Wilson as one of the film's villains is about as convincing in the role as..well, Berry as Catwoman.  As for Sharon Stone, she's Sharon Stone--though prone to occasional bouts of very fine acting(CASINO, THE MUSE), she doesn't seem to be in on the joke that her role was meant to be more over-the-top and instead tries to play it serious.  Only Alex Borstein, as Berry's gal pal, seems to get that this is far from a work of art and is actually in on the joke--she's the life of this very dull party. And I won't even tary long on the poorly staged action sequences or the cheap looking CGI effects--when someone said that they looked just like those from the accompanying video game, that was actually an overstated compliment. Ultimately, I'm not sure what's more disheartening--the fact that a movie this bad actually got made, or that the studio heads actually thought that the movie was good.",1106352000,3,2534,5.131067961165049

So that in mind, I was able to find things I liked about Catwoman. The movie is nice to look at. Catwoman bouncing off the walls was enjoyable to watch. She was sort of like a female Spider-Man. The colors and the sets were all done very well. So that's where my praise for this movie stops. I was really amazed at how bad these actors could act. The actors didn't believe the lines they were speaking and it showed. It had to be some of the worst acting I've ever seen. The story is incredibly stupid. Beauty cream that turns people's skin to stone??? And why would the villain want to sell this much less USE it??? Did she know she'd be battling Catwoman one day?

Any one that would take a movie spawned from comics too seriously has already set them self up to dis-like somthing that is meant to entertain rather than be so realistic its boring.  While I would agree that Spiderman 2 was better made and possibly more beleivable there were spots I felt like saying ""OK! OK! lets get to the action, we know spidy's in-love with Mary Jane.""

Nothing about the character in general has enough bulk to put a plot around her, yet alone enough personality to actually feel the character. The only thing Catwoman is good for is as a pin up girl for bondage lovers everywhere. Why Halle Barry decided to play a role that's so dry, boring, and lacks character development, plot, and pretty much everything that made Spiderman and even Wonderwoman great models of superheroism, who knows? The only thing that was hyped up about in this movie was the catsuit. Sure, it's hot and it's cute, but there should be more to a movie than just a catsuit.",1106265600,3,901,4.533742331288344

Halle Berry gave the best performance that she could, given the script she had to work with.  I admire the fact that she had to train very hard for this role too.  Being a whip-cracking practitioner myself for the past year, I can say that it is much harder than it looks.  Halle Berry did an EXCELLENT job with the whip in this movie (although the whip was definitely CG in the final scene).

Halle also had to train in a Brazilian martial art called Capoeira, which is very physically demanding as it requires you to be constantly moving, cartwheeling around and throwing kicks from unusual positons. She pulled it off pretty well for somebody at her level.  I'm actually going to start learning this fascinating martial art myself very soon.

Sharon Stone did alright as Laurel Hedare, sexy and manipulative, but as a villain in a comic book story, she seemed quite lame.  I think she is a good actress (Casino), but NOT for a movie like Catwoman.

The love story between the evolving Patience Phillips and Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) got annoying most of the time, but I guess it was supposed to be a catylist for Patience's evolution into Catwoman.

I don't know who played Patience Phillips friend Sally, but the moments with her in the film (while quite funny) were the scenes that gave the movie it's ""chick flick"" status.

Lambert Wilson as Mr. Hedare = Boring

So in the end, I guess the thing I truly admire about this film was the amount of hard work that Halle Berry had to put into this role.  I definitely think she has the ""stuff"" (for lack of a better word) to portray the complexity of this character, but she did not have much to work with here.  If they DO make a sequel, they need to cut back a lot on those lame one liners, not go too over the top with the cat thing, and most importantly they need to get some interesting villains and a good story.",1106265600,3,2119,4.439276485788113

This film was extremely entertaining.  Sure, it has one or two moments of ridicule, but overall it's a film no super-hero fan should miss.  Pitof did a great job of making the film flow smoothly.  The scene transitions are fresh and interesting, the CG effects are used at just the right times and the soundtrack was integrated brilliantly.  This is the first time that Catwoman actually has cat-like behaviour (not just a sexy woman in a tight black outfit).

Halle Berry plays Catwoman very well.  A huge majority of the stunts were done by her, the fighting and whip art is all her and she does it all wonderfully.  The catsuit is a bit unorthodox, but if you just go with it, it's really not that bad.  You could say it's the latest incarnation of Catwoman since she's never been the same from the moment she appeared in Batman comic books.  Another welcome surprise is Sharon Stone.  She looks amazing!  Her acting, I'd say, is up to par with the rest of her stuff (come on, she's never been that great of an actress).  I'd compare it to Basic Instinct.  And it's nice to see her in a villainous role again.  Ben Bratt's character kinda gets in the way.  Nothing too special about him really.

The plot is typical DC comics super-hero film plot.  Rich, powerful people trying to pull off an exaggerated and unrealistic plan in order to be even more rich.  That's how super-hero films always were, so get used to it.  As cheesy as it sounds, it works!  At the end of it all, I found that there wasn't one scene I wasn't interested it.  Whether it's the amazing action sequences, seeing Catwoman scale walls, or just the way a scene looks, everything is done very well.

The only improvement I'd make is to change her name from Patience Phillips back to Selina Kyle.  Otherwise, watch the movie.  Don't expect anything more than a flashy popcorn flick and you'll agree that it's not that bad of a film.

Based around the superhero genre made this movie ever so worse not only is the action crap because all she does is run up and down walls to get away from bullets half the story is based around her hooking up with some cop.

The animation put in the movie was quite low in quality compared to what they are able to do today, the original superhero thing where it shows a scene with him/her jumping, flying or swinging from building to building is added but with that extra touch of crapness, they show the scene at the worst possible times its soposed to get you into the movie a bit more but it looked to me like it was lessened by the scene.

The whole movie is supposed to build up to a final showdown and the one to beat is some super model who has hardened her skin with a new cosmetic cream which catwoman is trying to stop from being released, and she can't even fight back it just shows catwoman kicking the crap out of some defenseless woman who can't be hurt she does however manage to get a pole to hit catwoman with.

1189928,2,B0000060X7,"While other reviews are preoccupied with what's bad about ""Catwoman"", I have to say the movie has its moments.  Yes, it's a bad movie, and it's not even bad in a good way.  Still, it has its moments.

I am a comic book fan, and I am especially a fan of Catwoman.  I really enjoyed Michelle Pfeiffer's take in ""Batman Returns"" and while I would prefer to have seen a continuation of her story, I kept an open mind when word spread that the new Catwoman movie would introduce an entirely new character.  I didn't join the throngs of comic book fanboys who screeched ""It's not the comic book version!""  People seemed to forget that the Catwoman of ""Batman Returns"" bore very little resemblance to the comic book character in any of her various incarnations.  So, I continued to keep an open mind and resolved to judge the movie on its own merits.

First, Halle Berry does the best with what she has to work with.  A more than capable actress, she's appropriately mousy and likable as Patience.  As Catwoman, she's clearly into the role and having a lot of fun with it.  Yes, the costume is a bit, well, impractical, but then so are most costumes of comic book characters.

Contrary to what I've read in other reviews, I didn't think Sharon Stone, as villainess Laurel Hedare, came off all that badly.  Her character isn't entirely one-dimensional.  Stone plays Laurel with a hint of nihilism.  This is a woman who is victimized and clearly has nothing left to lose...only she's going to take out as many as she can with her.

CGI was necessary to give Catwoman the slinky, fluid motion to some of her action moves.  It is clunky and doesn't look too far removed from the graphics in the videogame tie-in.  Still, the action scenes are more than passable and enjoyable to watch.  Heck, if the entire movie could be re-edited down to the action sequences, that would be fine with me.

I have to give one negative comment about Lambert Wilson.  Gawd, was he bad.  Talk about one-dimensional.  And I really hated the overuse of speed motion photography and quick edits.

""The Many Faces of Catwoman"" feature on the disc is probably the best thing about the DVD release, though it would have been nice if the A&E Biography had been used instead of or in addition to this feature.",1106179200,3,2271,4.564356435643564
1189929,4,B0000060X7,"I'm one of those kind of comic book fans that see a comic book film and expect to see everything in the movie that's in the comic. I believed that every comic book based film should be as great as Spiderman or X-Men.

Then there are movies like Catwoman where the plot isn't as strong as Spiderman, the characters aren't as interesting as the X-Men, and the action isn't as great as the Matrix. And so what. Catwoman is an example of a good old fashioned adventure movie. It's the story of a woman who dies, is ressurected by an ancient cat, and seeks revenge against her murderer. Simple, basic, uncomplicated. That kind of movie where you don't need a dictionary or a psychiatric degree to figure stuff out.

It's easy to point out the bad but let's look at the good. It's an action film with a female lead and I'm sorry to say because we really should be beyond that whole issue but it's also an important point that she is a black female lead. It's funny, it's sexy, it's exciting, and the story may not be Oscar calibur but it doesn't suck. And as a Catwoman fan I was glad that though there were some crazy changes the essence of the character remained true. She was still independent, fearless, and had the whip, ha ha.

If anything I wish that Sharon Stone had more scenes. I think she was great as the really bad girl. I also loved that she wasn't one dimensional. She represented those beautiful women who are deemed obsolete when compared to some 18 year old fetus tripping down the runway. She was as much a victim as Patience. And Patience's friend Sally was great. Would've loved to seen more of her.

So Catwoman is a great, fun movie that actually has a couple of important moral lessons to teach and I hope there is a sequel!",1106179200,8,1742,4.38390092879257

Others are just entertainment.  This movie is supposed to fit in with the later.  It's not going to win any awards - it's a 'popcorn' movie.  Alright, so what happened?  Horrible script and amature direction.  Plain and simple.  The actors do a fine job but just can't overcome the script.

Why Bratt took a role in this thing I have no idea. Maybe he just wanted some screen time with Stone and Berry.

I was rooting for Berry, and was hoping for a good action flick, it is a comic book movie after all.  What I found was sorely disappointing on various levels.

To begin, the movie does not even come close to following the comic book ethos but more importantly it is so predictable and cliche-riddled it makes it barely watchable.  I found myself flinching at various ill-directed scenes.  The French director, a self described ""master of digital photography"" is clearly confused on how to re-make an ultra-hip urban catwoman.  The cheap attempts at substance, like explaining the empowerment of women through catwomen in history is almost laughable if not so insulting to one's intelligence.

Even when Catwoman was in pre-production, it was a forgone conclusion that this would be an absolute bomb.  Directed by french director Pitof, the film has no real visual flair besides the very sexy Halle Berry strutting around with hardly any clothes on, and there are quite a number of plain old bad CGI shots.  Sharon Stone gives her most wooden performance in her career, and other cast members Benjamin Bratt and Frances Conroy are wasted.  Not to mention, this movie has no original idea anywhere in it.  The tagline of the film trailers proclaimed, ""a cat can bring a soul back to the world of the living to make the wrong things right"".  Gee, anyone else remember the Crow?  If you're a fan of Berry, this is worth watching to see her gorgeous body in action, but if you are going to watch this strictly for that, your best bet is to fast forward through the rest of the film.

Well in the 90's Hollywood's gas tank was on empty, we had a decade of movies made from long dead TV shows (Beverly Hillbillies, Brady Bunch, etc.) We still have it today with Charlie's Angels and Starsky and Hutch. To mix it up a bit, the suits are now presenting us with an endless supply of Marvel Comic Superheros. Spider-Man, good. Hulk, bad. Cat Woman? Bottom of the barrel.

The title of this movie could have been ""Watch Halle Berry run around in a cat-suit, you know you want to"". That's really about it. I'm not a Halle Berry fan. I don't think she's all that. Maybe she would look better if she wore her hair like a woman.

Anyway, I'm rambling. If you are a Halle Fan you will see this no matter what anyone says. If you are a leather fetishest, you will to. So why does anyone bother to review this?",1106092800,,1025,4.38421052631579

1189937,3,B0000060X7,"I'm surprised at some of the reviews here, actually.  It seems we have become a society of cinematic snobs, demanding high quality, oscar winning scripts, directors, and special effects in each film and television show we see.  With such demands, its no wonder the cost effectiveness of reality TV has come on so big.

Halle Berry was, of course, the main reason to see this movie.  She had a smoldering, sexy intensity as the main character, and of course, it is pleasing to the male hormones to see her strutting around wearing a leather cat outfit, snapping a whip.  Admittably, Sharon Stone did not bring anything to this film, as she spoke her lines rather than recite them, and the idea of giving her some sort of unique super power at the end was just plain silly.

Otherwise, I think this had all the makings of a great super hero film.  The conflict of a secret identity versus the real person, the flawed romance, the sinister plot, and of course, the ending that left the way open for a sequel.  These are the exact same things that made the original Batman and more recently Spider-Man great movies.

And I have to admit, the scenes that involved Halle Berry behaving in catlike manners (scarfing tuna, oggling fish in a fishtank) made me laugh, as they reminded me, and I suspect anyone who see's this movie, of the every-day behavior of my own cat.

This movie was not meant to be an oscar winner, or a mega-blockbuster (althought it definitely did not meet studio expecations in its release).  It was meant to be just plain entertaining, a great way to spend a couple of hours on a boring afternoon.  Sadly, it fails to meet alot of expectations, largely propped up by recent earth-shaking hits like Spider-Man.

1189938,1,B0000060X7,"I'm a longtime comic-book lover, and I anticipate every theatrical adaptation with equal amounts of excitement and dread.  Some films, like ""Superman"" and ""Spider-Man,"" manage to capture the complete essence of the character in such a way that the whole absurdity of what's actually HAPPENING is lost in the magic of the story.  Good special effects are certainly part of this, but we believed Superman could fly (via an awkward harness) long before a CG Spider-Man swung from the NYC rooftops.

Having set the bar for comic-book/cinema translations then, let me just say that ""Catwoman"" was pure crap.  No fault to Halle Berry, either: she's a fine actress, worthy of Oscar accolades and other heady awards.  No, sadly, it was everything ELSE that sucked about this movie:  the plot premise, the writing, the leather bra...even the special effects were off, as if they alone were saddled with the chore of saving this cinematic turd, and they couldn't quite get the job done.  There's nothing here that captures in any way the comic-book complexity of the character of Catwoman, and that's what makes these types of films sink:  the expected notion that all you have to do is put an actor in a costume and let 'er rip.  No, no, no...there's a whole CHARACTER in there that's dying to get out!  Even ""Elektra,"" which wasn't GREAT, had clarifying moments when you got beneath the surface and discovered more to the actress than (another) bad leather bra.

1189940,2,B0000060X7,"I've heard for years and years that they were gonna make a Catwomen movie with Michelle Pfeiffer returning as Selena Kyle. That never got off the ground though and stupidly Warner Brothers decided to do it without Selena Kyle. It bugged a lot of comic fans that they'd do it without even having the character from the comic. It's not even original either, she even becomes Catwomen the same way Pfeiffer did in Batman Returns. Plus it's played out like Halle Berry has 2 peronalities and she has no control what she does when she has on the costume. Which is pretty silly and doesn't work. Plus the direction is done like a music video, hell think the director even started out making music videos. The action is too fast and messy looking to even be entertaining. Not one once of the action scenes even look realistic.

  I always thought that if Michelle Pfeiffer wouldn't come back that Sharon Stone could replace her. Instead of thinking...duh Sharon Stone could play Catwomen they cast her as an aging model obsessed with looking good. She has Halle Berry killed because she discovered that her aging make-up is dangerous. So Berry is brought back by cats and doesn't find it strange that she's more athletic and has a craving for cat food. She out plays Benjaman Bratt in Basketball and by jumping all over walls and being super athletic. Yet he doesn't figure out right away that she's catwomen. Oh plus she clawed his back when they had sex and...duh.

  It's not a good movie, not by a long shot but still Batman & Robin makes it look like Spiderman 2.  Halle Berry thinks she's too good to have a small role in X-Men as Storm but hey at least those are good super hero movies. Plus after embarrassing herself in this she should settle for playing Storm with open arms. If they couldn't get Michelle Pfeiffer back they should've just said ok that's it...no movie.

Halle Berry looks excellent in this, either in her 'plain' side (Patience Philips), or as her alter-ego (Catwoman), and I defy anybody not to appreciate her black leather outfit! ;)  The sets are good, and the supporting roles round out the movie well.

For what? Where else could you possibly go with that story? Tell me, i would like to know. What if they did continue with the Selina Kyle story, only the movie sucked, then what?

It's nice to see every once in a while a comic book movie not all the way dedicated to the comic. Explore a little. Try something different, and that's exactly what Warner Bros did with this story. People come on! The only thing not so great was practically the story, everything else was great.

Plus Halle's catsuit was way better than Michelle's suit.

Catwoman in my point of view is a: sexy, sleek, stylish character. Not a sewed up dominatrix.

I can't wait for the DVD because I am going to get it and I do think they should have released  the soundtrack.

1189950,4,B0000060X7,"Halle Berry is the pick of the Catwoman litter as Patience Philips, a regular girl who finds herself in the center of a dangerous plot that puts her life in deadly peril. Fortunately, she's got nine lives and friends in feline places. Clad in leather and cracking a whip, Patience/Catwoman embarks on a game of cat and mouse with the baddies who murdered her. At her side is Midnight, a canny cat who guides her in the ways of revenge and redemption kitty-style.

Right from the opening frame, we know we're in for cinematic catnip with the best feline-themed opening credit sequence since Walk on the Wild Side (1962). Filling us in on the back story of the legend and reality of catwomen, we see how cats were revered in Ancient Egypt and how a special, mystical breed called the Egyptian Mau crossed oceans of time to continue to guide certain women of destiny to this very day.

Patience is one of those catwomen, but when first we meet her she is all human. She's overworked and under-appreciated toiling as a graphic designer for Hedare Beauty, a colossal cosmetics company on the verge of releasing an avant-garde anti-aging product. When Patience happens upon the dark secret her employer is keeping from an unsuspecting public, she finds herself knowing too much to be allowed to live. In a mystical twist of feline fate, she is killed but then transformed into a supernatural, catlike creature with a strong sense of justice and a craving for tuna. Patience by day and Catwoman by night, she starts to unravel the mystery of her death (that is, when she's not unraveling balls of yarn).

When it comes to the fine-line catwalk of feline and woman, Berry is pitch-purrfect. She doesn't scratch fleas or lick herself in inappropriate places like Puss in Boots, but she does do a stellar simulation when it suits the character(particularly when she discovers catnip; when she's just waking up; and when she falls from a high place). When she's not out catting around, Patience is a regular girl (make that a regular, incredibly beautiful girl) trying to juggle her social life with her supernatural life.

Catwoman is certainly Berry's show, but her co-stars all keep up more than admirably. Benjamin Bratt plays Tom Lone, a cop who has fallen for Patience but is also on the hunt for the mysterious Catwoman. He's got an easy, likeable charm and is a good match for Berry. Wilson Lambert and Sharon Stone play Patience's evil bosses at the cosmetics company and they both undulate with delicious, comic-book villainy. Another standout is Alex Borstein as Patience's coworker and best friend, Sally. Frances Conroy has a small but important role as Ophelia a woman who shelters the sacred felines.

Catwoman is the comics cream of the crop because this is one of the few superhero films that showcases a female lead with such texture. Sure -- she's a sexy, self-assured kitten with a whip but she's also an interesting, entertaining character that we're more than happy to spend a couple of hours with. It's also a terrific movie for cat-lovers.

There are some clever, insider cat jokes (for instance, the way Catwoman orders a White Russian at a bar) but not as many as you might hope for. The filmmakers definitely missed some marks, especially with the music. In fact, the musical score is my only somewhat complaint. The music in the action sequences was good, but aside from that there is way too much ditzy pop vocalizing going on which will definitely give the movie a stale, dated sound as the years go on.

The lighting, sets, costumes, etc., are all super stylish and just slightly heightened for a comic book world look and feel without going over the top. The director, Pitof, has a strong background in visual effects and it shows here very nicely. With Catwoman, his first American feature, he also proves he has the pacing and timing for an action film well in hand.

The plot is about a woman who is killed, cats bring her back to life and she has new super powers.. just like any other Catwoamn story based on the Batman franchise, however this one does move away from that goofy un-realistic nature of Gothem City, and moves into New York, and even the villians are beleivable, but it still didn't intrest me with the lot about Catwoman who is becomign a self depended woman from her push over life before she died, and shes also out to get revenge on the person who killed her, who just happens to be doing something naughty!!

It's better then some of the Batman movies that have come out, and it does take on a more realistic approach to the Catwoman name and charactors. But I thats about all I have to say thats good about the film. and for those reasons alone is why I give it one more star then the lowest.",1101513600,,1040,4.221105527638191
1189954,1,B0000060X7,"""Catwomen"" was directed by a guy named Pitof, and it's a good thing that he is using a fake name, because after this mess, he's not going to want to put that name on anything Hollywood makes again. This is one mess of a movie, and I sensed it from the ads, but since I give everything the benefit of the doubt, I had to go check it out. Halle Berry gives one of the worst performance ever, but she was never that great of an actress anyway. I never saw the preformance that she won an Oscar for, ""Monsters Ball,"" but anything has to be better than this. Sharon Stone was awful as well, and Benjamin Bratt, who was never really that good anyway. The script was so weak, with awful lines, horrible situations, and of course, cliche's galore. There was a scene where Berry and Bratt was at a county fair, on a ferris wheel, and there is an electrical breakdown, and somebody almost falls off the wheel, but it's Catwomen to the rescue. There was another classic Berry/Bratt scene where they were playing basketball, and she used all of her new cat skills and cat powers to beat him. Throughout the entire movie there is a sexual undertone, and even when her character and Bratt's character ""make love"" he does wake up with a scratch on his back. It's actually pretty lame, but briefly funny. I also couldn't understand if Catwomen was supposed to be bad or not. I know that Sharon Stone's character was bad, but Catwomen fights her, which is the good side, but then she robs a jewerly store, which was her bad side. There was so coherent background to the character, and the movie feels like it was made in about eight seconds.

The movie actually starts with opening credits, which actually steals the little attention that you would want to have while watching this film. Halle Berry plays Patience Phillips, a young women who has too much patience to put up with all of the people at work. She works at Hedare Beauty, with her friend Sally, and always puts up with her boss George. His wife, Laurel, the face of the business, is going to retire, just as the company is releasing a new product that will reverse aging. The product does have a side effect, a terrible awful horrible one, and Patience ends up seeing the meeting that discusses it. She runs away, but ends up drowning in the ocean, or a lake, I can't remember. But, cats end up resurrecting her, because of Egyptian Mau, who used to hang out in old temples, but has been found around Patiences apartment. There is even a scene where she tries to stop it from jumping off a ledge, and a cop thinks that she was going to kill herself. Enter Tom, who is a cop. When Patience wakes up, her eyes go from the human pattern to the cat pattern, which was one of the lamest special effects I could think of. Patience doesn't remember anything, so she sets out to find out who killed her. She becomes Catwomen, with the slick, letal, sex like, whipping attire, but is then framed for murder. Tom begins to persue Patience, but then things begin to connect, and he could find out who Catwomen really is. . .

There was no point in ""Catwomen"" being made. It has to be the worst superhero movie I have ever seen, and I didn't even know if she was supposed to be a hero or not. I could think of so many things wrong with it, that I can't even praise it. There was a scene where, before Patience discovers that she has powers, she is walking with her friend, and they pass a women walking her dog, and the dog barks at her, and she hisses. It was supposed to be funny, but it was just funny because it was so awful. You end up not caring what happens to anyone, because nobody is likeable enough to care. Tom is always right around the corner to make sure nothing is wrong, and Laurel is so bad that she is always waiting for Catwomen to arrive. It's hard to write a review where there is nothing to say that is good about a movie, because it's so one directional, so I'll sum it all up in a single sentence. With lame special effects, a hack script, and terrible acting and direction, I have to call ""Catwomen"" one of the worst movies of the year--after ""The Girl Next Door,"" of course. I didn't like it, but you might.

ENJOY!

Rated PG-13 for action violence and some sensuality.",1101340800,5,4230,4.357414448669202
1189955,3,B0000060X7,"I have always liked the character of Catwoman. From Julie Newmar to Michelle Pfiefer, I have always found the character cool. I didn't go into Catwoman expecting to see a good movie.

I had reservations about it not being the real Selina Kyle Catwoman and I had heard it was the Showgirls of superhero movies. But I was pleasantly surpsised. I enjoyed the movie and thought it was fun. Halle Berry and Sharon Stone put in some good performances and the movie was nice to look at. It was glossy and ""pretty.""

The story, however, was limp and too short. The whole skin cream idea should have been thorwn out in pre-production. The music was also pretty bad, except for the main title, which was cool. The special effects I though were pretty good, better than Spiderman and The Hulk by far.

This movie is a good fun diversion for superhero fans.

Now, if you have always been a fan of the character of Catwoman there is a great documentary on the DVD. The Evolution of Catwoman chronicles all the catwoman incarnations over the years, her comic book origins, interviews with Michelle Pfiefer, Julie Newmar and others, with alot of original footage used.

What they have done is twisted the Cat Woman myth to make her some type of Egyptian Cat powered herion.  Think Wonder woman but Egyptian instead of Greek.

  Also the story line is thread bare with the clash between the two being predictable and booring.

Unfortunatly Hale has signed on for Cat Woman 2.  I guess this series will have nine lives like the cat it refrences.

1189958,5,B0000060X7,I really loved this movie.  So much so that I saw it twice on the same night.  I have not seen such a good movie in many years.  What made it so good was the terrific sound track.  I want to buy it as soon as it comes out and the movie also.  I loved the plot and Halle's movements as a cat looked very real.  The special effects were quite good.  I really will look forward to a sequel when it comes out.  Who cares if it really follows the comic book plots.  Lets have something new and creative.,1100304000,4,498,3.9
1189959,2,B0000060X7,"Some might think that Halle Berry's 'Catwoman' is full of hilariously campy fun; if it had been so, I would have given more stars for the trushy fun I might have gotten.  But the film turned out nothing like that -- in fact, watching it makes me feel more detached from the heroine, the story, the images, or actions.  They are often very campy, sure, and sometimes very bizzare, and sporadically thrilling.  But not campy, bizarre, or thrilling enough to be a minor cult classic.

One mistake is awfully empty and uninteresting story.  Patience Philips (Berry) is a timid designer working for a cosmetics company run by Lambert Wilson and his wife Sharon Stone.  But only the company's executives know that the new product contains a harmful substance.

And you know, Patience unwittingly comes to know the secret.  and see, she gets killed before the ancient spirit of sacred cat 'Midnight' takes over her body, and she is resurrected.

And?  Well, see what Patience/Catwoman does.  It takes much time for her to realize her power, so she, 'partially' losing her memories, goes back to the company where she almost got killed the day before!  As if nothing had happened!

OK, that's one of the silly mistakes in the story, but you get more (which I don't point out).  The rest of the film is about Catwoman who struts wearing high-heals, cracking a whip, dressed in black leather.  When you think the film is finally going to be fun (I mean, campy fun), Oscar-winner Halle Berry suddenly snatches meat of raw fish at sushi bar, and swallows it because, you know, she is a cat.  IS she kidding, or what?

Benjamin Bratt plays a cop who fell for her, and who does not know her identity.  But how many times have we seen before such kind of cliched police officer who should have checked out several things about his love?  Or, how many times has Banjamin Bratt played a cop before for that matter?  And not-so-good acting from Sharon Stone who just hasn't shown that she can act since the day of 'Casino'?

I really tried to like this film, but director Pitof, for all his visul skills, does not know what he really wants to do.  Actions?  Comedies?  Or just costumes?  He knew it in his previous work 'Vidocq' made in France.  Now I don't have a single clue to his intention.",1100217600,2,2276,4.599502487562189

I also felt the CGI effects were good and not overdone like the Incredible Hulk movie (ugh!) or even Spiderman. This movie deserved more in the way of positive press and box-office cause it Rocks! Fortunately Halle wants to do a sequel regardless of the outcome, because she enjoyed filming it so much. She did the majority of her own stunts and even broke her arm in the process. Dedication. Buy or Rent this DVD or catch it at a discount movie house near you. Set aside your prejudices on female superheros and race and just GO!

Berry's acting is petty to say the least, every line she utters has the clear crisp sense of phoning-it-in for the money around it, her more passionate scenes fall flatter than the late Christopher Reeve's wheelchair tires, and the director takes the film's action sequences through an MTV-style aerobatics festival that should please any mindless EMO music video marks.

I really enjoyed this movie, from the opening credits that were done very tastefully, to the action scenes (the jewelery store was my personal favorite, exceptional choreography). Sharon Stone is also here, and looks like she's having a blast being the villain. One thing I especially liked about the movie was the musical score.

I found Catwoman a rather enjoyable movie, especially for free :)  I put all my prejudices aside and decided to take it for what it was: an entertaining super-being (seeing as how shes neither a hero nor villain) romp that ended up being really fun to watch.

It's yet another of those ""origins of the superhero"" movies merely laying the groundwork for an abortive franchise.  There's nothing wrong with an ""origins"" story per se, and this one at least has the foresight to turn it into a murder mystery.  Problem is, it takes Patience Phillips (aka Catwoman) approximately 100 minutes to get to precisely the same place the audience is in after just 15: we already know who ""killed"" her and why.  Watching her slowly, painfully - even if gorgeously - discover what we've known all along isn't fun.  It's agonizing.  The saddest thing is, it doesn't need to be this way.  Tim Burton's ""Batman"" showed everyone - fifteen years ago! - how the superhero story can and should be told: just assume everyone already knows who the hero is and where s/he came from, and focus instead on creating a gripping adventure and a wonderful villain; flashback to the ""origins"" story if you like, but why make that the focus if it's going to be dull?  Basically, follow the principles of good storytelling: create a mystery, make us identify with the hero, give the audience reason to keep watching to the end.  Some of the best popcorn movies in recent memory follow precisely that pattern - ""I, Robot"", ""Minority Report"", and the ""X-Men"" series.  In ""Catwoman"", most of the effort (and budget) seems to have been spent on a handful of absurdly edited and utterly unconvincing fight sequences and some ludicrously elaborate fly-overs of the city skyline.  But no amount of digital trickery can compensate for what has got to be the lamest script this year.  It's about time the John Brancato / Michael Ferris writing duo were exposed for the talentless hacks they are.  ""The Game"" was their only decent offering, and even that had to be saved by David Fincher's direction.  ""Catwoman 2""?  You're all dreaming.",1096675200,5,2140,4.93854748603352

Sometimes this movie actually does border on emotional involvement as Halle Berry puts in a brilliant performance as Patience Phillips, a tortured soul who becomes free for the first time in her life after turning into Catwoman the ultimate night crawler who slinks her way from one beautifully shot scene to another, the beginning is the best part of this movie as it really is well written. Unlike Spider man though Catwoman is having a ball, she's free, strong and totally inderpendant. The part where the movie maybe falls down is when Catwoman becomes intangled in a conspiracy plot involving a cosmetic company, the writers seem to be more involved in the brilliant action sequences than the quality of the script.

But, all that aside, ""Catwoman"" is really very good.  The plot is simple and ""campy"" (just like the legendary Pam Grier films).  Patience Phillips comes across a conspiracey and is murdered because she ""knows"" to much.  She comes back becuase this cat has some funky breath and gives her super powers.  That's about as believeable as a radio-active spider.  I hate spiders.  Getting off track here... Patience becomes a ""Catwoman"" with cat-like strengths and she puts them to good use (robbery.)  Her claws are diamonds, which I find to be amazing.  There is some romance in there, a few good fight scenes, and Halle Berry.  Need I really say more?

I think there is a problem with some critics and some people reviewing this film even on this Amazon film review?

Please look at this movie with a open mind, do not compare with Batman,  Eartha Kitt, Selina Kyle, Michelle Pfeiffer, Julie Newmar, Lee Meriwether, Gotham City.  The Anti hero.. etc.  That is not the notion of this film, it wants to leave that.

People have miss judged this film wrongly, it is not set in the Batman Universe or anything like it, please get that fact.

It is not suppose to be inline with any of the DC Hero/villain genre please get that.

It is inspired by Bob Kanes, Batman Character, but it never said it is a part of that world.

Once Warner gets past that barrier as it has, after the main credits it can do anything it wants with the Character it can,  They can make her a God damn alien for all I care.

As for the film, if it was that bad it would not have made it into the top 10 at the Box office, am I right, actually it got to number 3, which is still damn good. So lets get that out of the way.

It is a good enjoyable film I am not saying the script is brilliant, even some of the best films have not so good scripts,  where they get complex and loose the point.

Reading from some of the negative reviews I see people thinking, that they believe it should be a serious film dark and mysterous like Tim Burtons Batman.

Also Catwoman of the comic is of social missfit and uses the cat notion as a mask of

criminal function, as is batman uses his theme for the same Iconic function, as does Poison Ivy, Robin.  They don't have any trates that are of the namesake at all.

Halle Berry has done a really good Job as Catwoman, she really has researched the character of the cat well, its movements the posturising, the free spirit and the senses as well as the climbing and squeezing through things and the fluid movements in action.  This is something not one of the other characters of the Batman movies have done, simply because it is not the same.

This is a light hearted entertainment for all the ""Family,"" it is certainly not a pigeon hold Genre movie to fit in with Spiderman, X-men Superman, Hulk, Punisher, Batman.

These films follow the comics, this one does not, and that is just the success of what it

has done to move the name out of that as a stand alone story.

For the die hard fans,  I don't think they really understand that this film has done them

a saticfation rather than a dissaticfation, by leaving the Character unscathed, as

another movie can be made ""based on the Comic book Character"" and not inspired by it.  This is two different things.

Sharon Stones Character may have been a bit wooden but it was good to see her again

and scrapping with Halle.

This film is more mystical based film, which leaves more open for a possible sequal.

I see this film Like I saw Yancy Butler in Witchblade and that was what???..

Wait and see things will be made clearer and that is where I get the comparisons from.

Both are based on mystery and spiritual belief of a linage dating back thousands of years.  Both Characters also had this mysterious mentor who knows more about the gift than the bearer does themself.

There is a lot of promise for the film when it reaches DVD.

Also remember when critics write bad reviews, it usually has a opposite effect on the reader, this adds curiosity and makes people see the film to see what the commotion is about. so negative effects has opposite effects.

I should know I have written articles for  national/ local newspapers and have letters printed in comic books as well.

Negativity brings in good reading, believe me it works.

1189984,5,B0000060X7,"Halle Berry pounces onto the super hero scene as Catwoman.  In a genre where men have had the leading roles, it's refreshing to see the lead in super hero movie go to a woman, especially when then that woman is African-American.  I watched this movie very closely and it was portrayed very convincingly.  Halle portrayed her role perfectly, while other preformances were expected, such as Ben Bratt.  Having seen him as a detective on NBC's Law & Order it appeared this role didn't fully test his acting ability.  While Halle had a similar role in X-Men, as it was in the same genre, the fact that she had the lead in a film like this was just so great.  I can't wait for the DVD to be released.",1094601600,8,695,4.390625
1189985,5,B0000060X7,"See this movie with no expectations of what it's supposed to be like and you'll have fun. Halle is beautiful, brilliant and a very convincing feline. Sharon Stone is a great over-the-top villian. And the funny bits are supposed to be funny, people. It's called comic relief. Lighten up!",1093996800,6,286,4.857142857142857
1189986,5,B0000060X7,"Since everyone and their cat seems to have a strong opinion on this movie I might as well give mine too. I loved it! Halle Berry is an awesome actress and her transformation into Catwoman is wonderful and so much fun to watch. Her character is just as interesting as Michael Keaton's Batman (and he's my favorite movie superhero), I can't imagine a better choice for the villian than steely Sharon Stone and Benjamin Bratt as the cop/ love interest is - well - lovable! I especially like his character's subtle strength and OK the fact that he's incredibly handsome doesn't hurt either ;-) So many people seem to be putting down the plot but I love this new twist on the Catwoman story, and Patience's interactions with the cat caretaker (and possibly priestess of the cat goddess?) Ophelia. I didn't know much about Egyptian mythology before I saw the movie but I've been reading about Bast and cats in ancient Egypt a lot lately. It's fascinating, and the movie seems to have gotten most of it right. If this movie is still playing where you are, give it a chance! It's very entertaining, gorgeous to look at and the music is wonderful. It's worth sitting through all the credits at the end to hear parts of the soundtrack one more time! I wish they'd put the soundtrack out on CD.",1093824000,5,1283,4.558441558441558
1189987,2,B0000060X7,The only GOOD thing I can say about this film is that Halle Berry is in it and that's about it. Not that I am much of a fan of the comic book character but the director took some serious liberties in revamping the character. It's basically NOT the Catwoman from the comic book. The villainous just seems to be a boss whose having a bad day at the office. And the battle with Catwoman seems to border on the goofy. This is great film for the MST3K treatment.,1093305600,3,457,4.146067415730337
1189988,3,B0000060X7,"I hope that Halle Berry and Crew make a sequel to ""Catwoman"" and improve on this first movie.  My first complaint about this film is that it is not Selena Kyle and the Catwoman of the Batman comic series.  I would loved to have seen them base it on this character and had Catwoman in Gotham City.  My second complaint is that Sharon Stone makes a GREAT villian and I just don't think she was given enough to do as supermodel femme fatal.  Francis Conroy's character wasn't really explained and Benjamin Bratt's character wasn't all that interesting.  That said, I liked Berry as Catwoman.  I though she was very sexy and given the chance, could improve in the role (thought I still like her as Storm of the X-Men better).  Pitof's use of camera angles and the way Catwoman really moved like a cat was really cool and one of the best things about the film.  With the origin of our feline heroine out of the way, the sequel (should they make one) should be more focused on action and a good story.  And, if they are gonna get someone like Sharon Stone as the villain, make sure and use her to her potential and not let a really fun actress go to waste.

Berry fans will want this as a part of their collection but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to everyone.  Hard core comic fans will be disappointed.",1093219200,2,1298,4.344398340248962
1189989,3,B0000060X7,"Catwoman isn't a movie but more of a flashy music video that features raw special effects and is littered with cheesy dialogues with a lack of emotional core. Clearly this movie has deviated from the portrayal of the dark feline heroine to a lame exercise in waxing empowerment in women. Halle Berry is the lone bright spot in the movie, playing Catwoman with a sensual grace and giving us a convincing transformation from the silenced mousy designer Patience Philips to the heroine who battles an over-the-hill cosmetics mogul (Sharon Stone) out to destroy beauty. Seeing her prancing around in her tights and wielding the whip should be worth the ticket price for some. Catwoman clearly aspires to be a C-grade popcorn movie with high camp value. In this aspect, it succeeds - the bad script and exaggerated cat-fights really left me unexpectedly hysterical and even embarrassingly at times purring in delight.",1093219200,,912,5.046357615894039
1189990,4,B0000060X7,"Many people have said that this movie was terrible, many of them say it because of the change in the story from the comic books.

I personally like this film because its for females, which is one reason why i liked not having batman in it to take away catwomans role. The males have spiderman to watch throwing his webs around and the females have catwoman to see cracking her whip, each get their traditional hero/heroin with superpowers film.

Now to the change in story. I personally have not read the comics, but from the other reviews i have read they changed the name and some of the personality.

A name can tell alot about someone, the change of name changed with the character.

Selina Kyle sounds like the name of a confident outgoing person. At the start of the film patience was anything but that, being clumsy and apologising all the time. So the name had to be changed with the personality. The name Patience showed that underneath catwoman there was still the shy artist.

The plot, i believe, was supurb(sp?). Rather than like in spiderman, Catwoman was fighting fantasy characters with superpowers, she was instead fighting a company who was making a product that was hurting her friend. Giving her a very big reason to want to stop them. There were no plot holes, unlike in Harry Potter, where it was purely a fan film. I could go and see catwoman without reading the comic previously and know exactly what was happening.

One good thing also about the slight plot/name/personality change was that for those who read the comic, they would not know exactly what was going to happen.

On to the CGI effects. Yes, you could blatantly see that they were CGI, but it still looked cool. I think that because of the so blatant CGI effect brought the original comic book feeling back to it, which is what catwoman originally was, a comic book.

The only thing that i will say was really bad about the film was the strobe lighting. Yes, it was a very cool effect, but i feel sorry for those epileptic people who cannot go and see the film because of it. The strobe lighting was not really needed, and the scene was not essential to the film. I hope, even though it is not very likely, that on the dvd there will be an option to not have the strobe lighting scene or something.

Overall, you have to go and see this film with an open mind. The film will not ruin your life just because it is bad, you might even think it is good. It is a matter of taste.",1093046400,4,2462,4.441241685144124
1189991,5,B0000060X7,"Okay, I admit it. I saw Catwoman three times already and enjoyed every second of it. However, everyone else's complaints with this movie are valid. One, this should have been a movie about a socialite by night, Jewel thief by later at night, who ends up finding herself in a situation where she finds herself fighting for good. Perhaps she ends up trying to take down an evil mob family who attempts to blackmail her. Or she could even take down an evil cosmetic giant who is .... Oh say .... Mutating and killing cats as test subjects (If they choose to keep the camp element), or recast her sister Maggie as the Hedare graphic artist who Catty avenges. As ""Enjoyable"" (not good, though not bad) as I thought the movie was, all the pieces were there to make a great movie. What went wrong? What didn't go wrong?

The Good

The casting of Halle Berry -Halle Berry would have made an excellent Selina. Yes, black/shmack, after seeing Catwoman I am convinced that she would have made an excellent Selina, she would have infused Selina with a conscience, a code of ethics, an honor amongst thieves. Selina is high class, glamorous, Halle would have made an excellent Selina. Don't get me wrong, she had me in Patience's corner, but I would have loved to see her Selina.

The casting of Sharon Stone - always an awesome villainess, could have been so much more.

The direction-yes I liked the combination of film noir/camp/music video ... It was original, and daring.

The bad

The story = brainless and stupid. Selina would have never cared about a bunch of vein women poisoning themselves.

premise = granted, as someone posted earlier, it is just as believable as any other comic book origin, however the viewing audience hasn't had a few decades to get used to the idea.

Benjamin Bratt = how can two awesomely sexy people have so little sexual tension

Patience and Tom sleeping together = Both times I saw this movie I saw several kids having a pretty good time, however that one scene made it completely inappropriate. Besides it wasn't needed, he could have found the nail/jewel another way.

The Ugly

The costume-the mask was odd and made her look like Ratwoman. it was too complicated and distracting.

With so many things going into this project being so excellent, this movie breaks my heart.  has dropped the ball.",1092700800,2,2324,4.680589680589681
1189992,3,B0000060X7,"In this movie, Halle Berry plays a young artist named Charity who enjoys running headlong into other people (apparently she's a masochist like Maggie Gyllenhaal's character in 'Secretary' -- given her taste in leather and whips, she might have more in common with this character, as well).  Anyhoo, Chastity runs afoul of evil cosmetic makers (no, I'm being serious here), who have her killed!  Fortunately, a magical cat brings Prudence back to life, except with all these neato cat-powers.  Such as being really good at playing basketball, wielding a whip, cutting hair, and riding a motorcycle ('cause we all know how good cats are at these things!)  She also starts actually BEHAVING like a cat, doing things that Garfield would do like wearing tight leather and stealing jewels.  Nothing really happens in the movie, but along the way you get these really hee-larious lines that will have you blowing Coke out of your nose:

""How purrrr (SNORT!!!) fect!""
""Get your paws off me!""
""There goes my jumpshot!""  (You can't really overstress the importance of basketball in a movie about a woman with cat powers!)

Predictably, at the end, there is a, ermmm, catfight between Prudence and the evil head of the cosmetic company, played by Sharon Stone.  No contest you say?  Well, Sharon's been bogarting this secret beauty formula that not only disguises the fact that she's like 100 years old, but turns her skin like ROCK HARD! So Hope has to watch those nails while she's fighting!  (...)  Aside from me nearly falling asleep during the ""love"" scene and almost walking out in disgust during the basketball scene, I must say it was pretty fun.  Three and a half stars.

1189993,3,B0000060X7,"Okay, look.  There are a lot of different reasons for a movie to exist and be worthwhile. There are the deathless classics, the side-splitting comedies, the great action adventures.  And there's a small but persistent little sub-genre of motion pictures that exist to record for all time the state of the art in the female form.  Truffaut once said that the history of the cinema is the history of boys taking pictures of girls.  Condemn it, accept it, your choice.  But there's no denying it exists.

  Would anyone ever under any circumstances have ever given a toss for ""The Outlaw"" if it didn't feature Jane Russell's two most marketable assets?  ""Gilda"" is a solid little noir, but would anyone but the most intense enthusiasts remember it if it didn't have Rita Hayworth throwing that flaming red (even in black and white) mane around?  Who'd remember ""The Seven-Year Itch,"" a dull unfunny comedy, if the subway train didn't blow that ""delicious"" breeze up Marilyn Monroe's skirt?  Without Raquel Welch's doe-skin bikini, who in their right mind would sit through the grunting stupidity of ""One Million Years BC?""

And I could go on and on.

Yet these are iconic images from iconic films.  Pick up any well-illustrated book about the movies and you'll see pictures from ""Citizen Kane"" and from ""One Million Years BC.""  It ain't because they're on equal footing quality-wise.

Critics have roasted this ""Catwoman"" movie, because, I guess, that's what critics are paid to do.  They come up with stupid cat puns to condemn a movie with stupid cat puns in it.  How helpful.

But it seems clear to me that this is a movie made to celebrate Halle Berry's dazzling body.  And the superhero genre is a great place to do that, because the plot is incidental and the heroine can be in costume, and still have all the flaunted sexuality of nudity.  In fact, Halle's been nude in two other movies (that I know of), but there's always a kind of sadness, trepidation, or despair to those scenes.  The Catwoman costume gives her the license to let go, and she does.

People kvetching that this movie doesn't feature the Catwoman of the comics or the TV show are willfully missing the point.  This is a movie about Halle Berry's cat sculpted body and it is worthwhile for that alone.  State of the art.",1092614400,3,2292,4.7272727272727275

1189998,5,B0000060X7,"I literally just got home from seeing this movie and trying to buy the soundtrack (sadly... none of the places I went to had it in stock).

First of all I am an old school comicbook collector, so I go to see ALL the superhero/classic comicbook movies.  In fact those are the ONLY movies I watch on the big screen (all the others I can wait for the DVD).  I, too, was curious to see how they would construct the character as a hero, since in Batman lore, Catwoman was a villain.  Other than the fact I don't like cats in general (i.e. I'm more of a dog person :-), I thought the character origin (i.e. where she got her powers) was certainly as believeable as any of the other hero movies (Peter Parker gets bitten by a radio-active spider, Clark Kent falls from the sky and just so ""happens"" to be ""solar"" powered, etc.).  So Patience (Halle) gets brought back to life by a cat with supernatural powers... same difference.  For those of you who haven't seen the movie yet... don't believe all the negative, pessimistic hype!  For all the naysayers out there... Don't be Hatin'.

Also as both an electrical and a software engineer, again I was as impressed (if not MORE) impressed with the special effects as with any movie out there.  I mean people flocked out to see the Star Wars Prequels as if guided by a pied piper, and that stuff was 100% computer generated (can you say ""arcade""?).  For some reason, the Matrix has set the standard for people exhibiting exaggerated ""hang time"" during fight or combat scenes.  It was actually refreshing to see very little of the ""Matrix hang time"" in Catwoman.  I mean... on a facetious note... seeing Halle Berry prancing around in a cat suit is really all the special effects ANY movie needs... :-)  But I digress...

The PLOT and STORYLINE definitely had more depth than Spiderman 2.  What was refreshing in the Catwoman plot was that the villains were REAL people, scandalous corporate types who had realistic motives.  In Spiderman 1 and 2, we're basically dealing with crazed mad scientists, with lab generated super-strength.  I walked out of Spiderman 2 thinking... the storyline wasn't that great, but at least I saw another superhero movie...

In addition... isn't it ironic that Super Model Halle Berry and Classic Beauty Sharon Stone star in this movie that shows defects in the vanity and greed of the ""beauty industry"".

I have NEVER gone back to the big screen to see a movie a 2nd time... but Catwoman will probably be the first...",1091923200,5,2488,4.626423690205011

Maybe because the director is french, lately in America it seems that beind fremch is bad just because they didn't support the Irak war. But it's not politics what we're talking about so better leave them aside.

The movie was way better than i expected, honest! I just went to see it 'cause the director was Pitof and had seen Vidocq, which is a master piece. I had no idea about anything of the movie, becuase i wanted to go completely spoiler-free to the cinema... and it exceeded my expectations!

The plot wasn't that good but hey! it's just a superhero movie. The plot of any batman is even more lame, it goes always like: ""Super villian wants to end with Batman and the whole city for some personal reason that we don't get to know until the end of the movie, but when you know what that reason is the whole plot it's just a waste of time"". Or the first Spiderman movie.. it was about a guy that becomes spiderman and saves the city from some guy that became crazy after an experiment... no comments to that.

The acting... that was GOOD. Halle Berry do her character just fine, and her movements are simply cool. I bet she had to do a lot of training to get to do that. The fight style is based on capoeira, which is a brazilian fight style mixed up with dance [if you've seen Eddie Gordo in the tekken series you know what i mean]. Benjamin Bratt.. well, he didn't have much dialogue, but i think that his face really shows what the character has in mind, the doubt about if the girl is really the murderer or if she isn't. The Hedare couple.. they're cool actors, both. Lambert Wilson plays a character somehow similar to the Merovingian of the Matrix series, and he does it as fine as he did in Matrix Reloaded. Sharon Stone... well, it was good to see her back on screen. She's a really good actress and well, i was amazed by her character. It really shows how society in general treat actress and models... when they're not pretty enough they're out... sad but true, and it is a reality.

Music... it wasn't THE ULTIMATE MUSIC, but it really fit the movie. Techno, r'n'b, hiphop... a bit of everything, very well done. I liked it.

And finally the film. To me, the way it is made is really creative, i just felt it innovative. Not as vanguardist as Vidocq but something really refreshing. He gets the correct atmosphere for the movie, and makes it look contemporary and futuristic at the same time... simply cool.

And that was my opinion. To finish this really long review i just want to make a recommendation to everyone [catwoman lovers, catwoman haters], please if you get the chance see Vidoqc. Best movie i've seen.",1091923200,5,2694,4.452332657200811

My youngest daughter loved the fight scenes, booing the villians and cheering for Catwoman. My husband, who is also a fan of the Batman movies, liked this version of Catwoman more than the Batman Returns version. He has no problem with strong female heros, bless him.

1190001,1,B0000060X7,"File this movie under the ilk of ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" et al...  Instead of all of us getting to drool all over ourselves at Halle Berry's gorgeous, ahem, ""gifts,"" she is actually the one in charge, playing a feline dominatrix in the patriarchy that is the modern world.

The film is the story of a woman named Patience, a lowly design artist for the advertisement department of a huge, evil makeup corporation (whiffs of the Joker's ""smiley"" ingredient).  One day she discovers the company's new product Beau-line, a facecream apparently, leaves it's users horribly disfigured if they discontinue usage.  Aside from this being the most brilliant customer retaining scheme ever, it's also the reason that Patience turns into Catwoman, and finds something to do as Catwoman.

So upon becoming Catwoman, what would you do?  I would probably get out that leather outfit I've been looking for an occasion to wear and go strut my stuff.  I'd also procure a whip.  Ah yes, the whip, which (besides a cigar) is such a wonderful symbol for male genitalia.  The fact that she has mastered the whip is no little oversight for this movie; it's a strong statement of the film's line of thought.

However, it's the film's only line of thought.  Nowhere does Catwoman get the development she needs, and neither does Frances Conroy, who is in on the whole thing and lets Halle Berry in on exactly what she is.  If anything, this Ophelia character needed all kinds of screen time, but alas she gets only two moments on camera.  The other characters really aren't worth mentioning because they have almost no significance besides to move plot.  Even the doctor that Patience's friend marries is billed as ""Hottie Doctor.""

Apparently Halle Berry made this movie after a second divorce, and who afterwards swore never to marry again.  In that case, this film can probably be viewed as Halle's coming-out party, her declaration of her absolute independence from herself, from men who have apparently ruined her life, and from good film roles.  If this weren't enough, a character actually says the line, ""I'm a woman, I'm used to doing things I don't want to do.""

The implication is that men have told her what to do and subverted her independence through their control.  Or perhaps it's a statement of a women who has bought into the feminine status quo (set by men, of course) and forced herself to fit that model of ""woman.""  Pick either one you like, this movie doesn't care.

PS. This movie is rated PG-13, obviously so that kids can go see it and thus, cha-ching, more money.  However, the movie begs to be an 'R' rated movie, and almost deserves that sort of freedom.  It's curious that a movie such as this doesn't just take that leap, especially when kids routinely get to see 'R' rated movies.

PPS. It's obvious no one finds my review helpful, so let me just say it again.  I think this is a terrible movie with wafer-thin characters, noodle-firm plot and is as much a statement of individuality as it is a cry for help.",1091923200,4,3032,4.729523809523809

As for the professional critics, I don't understand them either but at least there were some reasons given, though a lot of the reasons seemed silly to me. Several hated the premise - Patience's transformation into Catwoman as reward for coming to the rescue of a magical cat on a mission from an Egyptian cat goddess. I guess they preferred Selina Kyle turning feline due to an attack by a mob of evil cat vampires in Batman Returns. As for Ms Berry's acting - she didn't ""over act"" she acted like a cat. Maybe the majority of critics are dog people :-) And what was wrong with Benjamin Bratt's performance? Maybe the critics would have preferred a muscle bound macho superhero  instead of the strong, sensitive and handsome Detective Lone. It seems to me the greatest crime this film committed was not being what most people expected it to be. This review is not for those people. It's for those openminded pople who would like to see a fun summer movie.",1091836800,8,1460,4.637065637065637
1190003,3,B0000060X7,"This movie featured halle berry in one of her worst performances yet.  She looked good in the costume. The computer generation and stunt doubles looked too fake and some didn't even look like Berry.  If you love comic book adaptations and super hero movies, you may like it. Its the worst comic book adaption I have seen yet.

In this movie, there was a story but the storry was crap. It didn't show anything to improve the story such as her making the costume. The only part of the story you may be able to remember is that she was an average girl ( didn't have confidence in herself ) and she got her powers by saving a cat off an ledge of an statue on her apartment building. Now, that was just plain stupid.

During action scenes you could only see stunt doubles. In the action scenes u could only see a little flash of her face and the rest was a stunt double. The computer generation used in the movie was a disappointment. The action was also a little stupid because of the crappy story that made it happen.

In conclusion, Catwoman is a disappointment to all of the comic book adaptations but to some who enjoy the very bad CGI may like it. But to most the movie was crap. I found it to be an ok movie I would not go to watch it again. All in all i rate this movie with a D-.",1091750400,,1283,4.136546184738956

And I loved how they incorporated America's obsession with looks and vanity into it by making a cream/makeup that promises to keep you young.  A 'Mr. Cranky' gave it a bad review because he thought it was an awful idea to use this idea...but if he was take a look around the WORLD...then he would see almost everyone's obsession with looks and youth.

Halle Berry truly proved to have all the hype, but falls flat on top of her feet and on her face with Catwoman. To be honest with you, I wasn't even impressed with this knock-off to the Batman franchise that has held well for years. Especially putting Catwoman as a heroine, instead of the popular villianess from earlier in the Batman stories. It really wasn't appealing at all for Halle Berry to take on this role in my eyes. She was much more like her super-heroine character Storm in X-MEN and X2, but not here. This is one I strongly suggest you don't see. Wait until the next real Batman sequel to hit those theaters over this junk!",1091664000,2,783,4.444444444444445

Her acting was average, and I felt and in some parts of the movie I think she felt that she wasn't doing her best.  The story was a little stupid, however it wasn't unstructured. The big mistake the screenwriters took was separating her from Selina Kyle, the villainous woman from the Batman films.  The movie would've generated a bigger following had the film taken place in Gotham city.  Sharon Stone also makes a comeback role reprising the evil murderous woman she plays so well.  Another thing about the film is that Catwoman is saving the world from poisonous beauty products, which is not a relatable fear.  This film in no means will make people cringe when they pass the makeup counter at a department store.  All in all, this film was fun to watch but lacked in uniqueness and class.",1091491200,,948,4.601190476190476
1190008,5,B0000060X7,"After reading some horrendous (and I mean really, really bad reviews of ""Catwoman"", I was definitely considering giving it a miss). I have to say that after having seen it, I am absolutely at a loss to words as to why the critics have mauled it so doggedly, and in my opinion unfairly.  Were we watching the same film? What was so bad about it? Sure so the plot was on the thin side and the dialogue was highly camp, but other than that I can't see what has provoked the spewing of critical vomit all over this film. Halle Berry makes an adorable Patience, and displays her vulnerability believably and effectively. On the other hand, she really sexes up the screen as Catwoman with the witty one-liners, the hot costume and the raunchy whip cracking. Once again Halle has displayed her versatility.

 This film is called Catwoman, the name should explain itself. I don't understand why people are ripping it to shreds or calling it laughable, e.g. as in the way Patience acts becoming Catwoman, i.e. the catnip incident (once), the hissing at dogs (once), the tuna (once, which I found to be amusing), the prancing around. What exactly did you expect her to do? How else do you act like a cat? How else does a human gain feline tendencies? Got any better ideas? I didn't think so. Yet we don't rip Toby Maguire to shreds when he shoots web from his arms (yeah like THAT makes sense.) There is clearly a double standard approach adopted by some critics, who contradict themselves more then they'd care to admit. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy Spiderman as well as this.

 This not brain food and you don't have to evaluate your life after it but hey, people need that once in a while. It's a fun movie... The CGI was NOT bad, sure it was obvious at times that it wasn't Halle but for the most part it was done to a high standard. Let's be honest here and give credit where credit is due the cinematography is superb. It has such a visual allure, a dark, rich atmospheric look, and it is almost sexy to look at. The camera work is very original looking, kudos to Pitof, am I the first person to actually praise him? I think so. The scene where the Egyptian Mau brings Patience back to life is beautiful and picturesque. The music creates an epic mood.

Sharon was fun to watch as the ""past it"", shallow, bitchy Laurel Hedare. Alex Borstein shined as Patience's best friend and Benjamin Bratt did the best that he could with what he was given as dialogue. Lambert Wilson plays his part, in the usual camp style, but does it to perfection. All in all the acting is not bad, and unless somebody hasrsonal vendetta against Halle Berry, it can't be said that she didn't put her all into the part. She was sizzling as Catwoman.one critic said that she looked as sexy as a hairball in the outfit. Either a jealous woman or a man with terrible taste in women must have written that. Halle has undeniable sex appeal in the part. The soundtrack is typical summer movie fare with the usual dramatic theme song, mixed with the current popular styles, hip-hop, r'n'b. This is after all a film that has to appeal to a teenage audience. The action scenes are exciting and well executed. The ending is suitably over the top but still entertaining. One scene that I thought was ridiculous was the basketball scene and some of the dialogue could have been much better, however the positives weigh out the negatives for me.

This is no Citizen Kane or Pulp Fiction but its no Gigli or Swept Away either. I have seen way worse comic book movies. Daredevil, Hell Boy and undoubtedly Hulk were worse than Catwoman. It is, on no level one of the worst films ever made. What were people thinking writing that? I went in with the lowest expectations possible for Catwoman and came out of the theatre having seen a supremely entertaining, undeniably above average film. Critics should be ashamed of themselves and audiences should not be puppets. This is worth seeing. There has been a ""Let's jump on the bandwagon"" attitude regarding this film. One person bashes it and suddenly everybody does. I'm glad I went to see this film so I could make up my own mind regarding it. I usually do agree with critics but on this one, I beg to differ. Everybody is entitled to an opinion, you might not like mine, and I might not like yours but there is no need to be downright nasty and unfair when reviewing something. There is such a thing as being balanced. Oh and before people start complaining about the absence of Selina Kyle, and Gotham city, who cares, life is too short.

So if you want to some light, leave your brain at the door entertainment, go to see Catwoman. If you want to see a high drama Oscar category film, go to see something else. It's fun, sexy action-packed, camp, stylish summer fare. It is a step above the usual Hollywood fare in the style stakes. Pitof shows a typically stylish French attitude. Halle Berry does herself proud. If you want to be a gullible puppet, believe the ""we're failed artists"", overly critical, intellectually snobby critics. I don't really care if that seems like a generalisation because it is most likely true. I bet many of them haven't even seen it.

Get such discrimination off your mind or you'll get rotten!

Those pathetic viewer who gave 1 star should feel disgraceful about themselves, they are not paying real critics but they want to kill the movie!!!

1190010,5,B0000060X7,"I think a lot of the critics just didn't get this movie. Maybe they were disappointed that it wasn't another chapter in the adventures of Selina Kyle. No, it's not: different name, different premise and totally different interpretation of what it might be like to become a Catwoman. What =I= don't get is why there is anything wrong with that? We're talking about a fictional character, people, lighten up! Some of the critics are saying that Halle Berry's performance is too ""over the top"" after she is transformed. Maybe for a 100% human lady but hey this is a story about a woman brought back to life by a magical Mau on an errand from Bast the Cat Goddess. Halle's facial expressions, voice and moves, especially when toying with her ""prey"", become verrrry feline which is a good part of the point of the movie. Another point is that Catwoman is both a tribute to female power and independence and also explores the darker side of power in both men and women and methinks some of the critics are a tad uncomfortable with both of these things. Whatever. There's plenty to like in this movie. A mythic storyline of initiation and rebirth, darkly beautiful visuals, a clever Egyptian-inspired cats-and-catwomen through history subplot that starts with elegant title art, solid performances from Sharon Stone, Benjamin Bratt, Frances Conroy and Hembert Wilson and a fine supporting cast both human and feline. Forget the critics. Go see this movie with an open mind and you'll probably enjoy it. And you might even love it as much as I did :-)",1091318400,11,1543,4.782771535580524
1190011,5,B0000060X7,"So many good puns where used in a bad way on this movie. It is really sad to me. I read reviews before seeing the movie, and I wondered what movie these critics went to see. Literally everything that was picked on was not an issue.

 Boston Globe, Wesley Morris - ""Halle Berry plays a superhero but fails to land on her feet...""

 Where did the notion come from that catwoman is a superhero? She is a chaotic good, but not superhero. She does what she wants to, if that saves some people or returns some stolen merchandise, so be it, but she does not to it for the sake of being good.

 She fights crime -- sorry, ""fights crime"" -- in tight, black, low-cut, scratched-up leather pants and a sports-bra/bustier that gives her better support than anybody in the movie.

 Again, Catwoman is not a superhero, she doesn't fight crime. Yeah, Halle Berry is eye candy. If the part was cast as anyone else someone would have a problem with that as well. And the supporting actors may not have been the best in the world but they did the job of support better then any of the claims made in this review

 Berry portrays a meek beauty-company graphic designer named Patience Philips in a city that seems a composite, not of actual cities but of cities concocted for commercials.

 There was no defined time and place of the movie. So the city could have simply had advanced billboards. I mean really, if saying this city is concocted for commercials then it's saying every city is concocted for commercials. This must be true because they certily told the writer of this review what to think.

 And she has a sassy best friend (Alex Bornstein) who seems a composite of other sassy best friends

 Someone should make Wesley Morris the TIME man of the year for that statement, because I think we all know the ""sassy best friend"" is a stereo type and an overplayed clich. This makes the movie less good how? I'm sure it's because no other movie made in the last two years had a clich in it.

 After Patience overhears that her company's new cream, Beauline, will erode the skin of any woman who stops wearing it, she is killed and brought back to life by a cat that coughs on her. From here, she's handy with a whip and endowed with incredible agility.

 If you can find a better reason to kill someone, then please do us all a favor and direct the next Van Dam movie.same goes for the cat concept. If you can think of a more logical way to become a catwoman then to laying in toxic waste and have a cat transfer it's essence into you, then by all means make your own catwoman spin-off. We accept that the cat created catwoman just like we accept Frankenstein created the monster or Tony Stark created an iron suit that allowed him to overcome paralysis. How about eddie Brock who became venom and rivaled Spiderman.

 To show off her new skills, endless passages give us a digitized Berry flying around rooftops and through sweaty alleys a la ""Spider-Man."" But when Spidey swings through Manhattan, we're at least aware that he's ecstatic about it. With this compu-catwoman, who knows?

 I'm sure I would be ecstatic if I had webs the strength of high-tension wires feeling like an orgasm coming out of a gland on my wrist too. Then again MARVEL and DC are two different comic universes

 True, a man is necessary only to win back the women in the audience mystified about why they've come to see Halle Berry do the ridiculous, like slipping her feline frame through the bars of a jail cell.

 I think the movie was liberating for a certain percentage of women and good clean fun for the rest. It's the chauvinistic comments in this review that really downplay the writer as a person. ""True, a man is necessary only to win back the women in the audience"". Women are free to enjoy whatever movies they want to enjoy, if it's an all women cast is tight leather, an all male cast, and mixed cast. It really doesn't matter. the reason for the police officer is plot. Something that escapes the minds of the people that write reviews like this one.

 Bratt's detective appears to have a ""Police Academy"" IQ. At some point, Catwoman knocks him about, licking and kissing him. Later, he goes home with Patience, and Bratt is so confused by the similarities, he actually has to check with forensics to see if they're the same woman.

 Yet another clich in play. The police officer being less intelligent then the criminal. Show me a movie with smart cops and I will show you a movie that's box office poison.. The reason why he took the evidence to forensics is to enhance the duality of catwoman. It would take the writer of this review becoming schizophrenic to understand having two personalities. If you have ever met a schizophrenic they can be literally two different people in the same body.

 Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. This is mine: I found the movie to be well worth my time and money. I enjoyed it, I loved it, I'll buy on DVD when it come out. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie.",1091318400,10,4994,4.475717439293598

1190013,4,B0000060X7,"It doesn't surprise me at all that ""Catwoman"" has been met with such hostility from critics and fans alike. They did change her name, background, and pretty much everything affiliated with the famed comic book character of Batman lore. However, these things certainly do not reflect the quality of the movie.

 For those of you unfamiliar with the plot, Patience Philips (Halle Berry) is a meek employee for a cosmetics corporation known as Hedare. The company is run by megalomaniac Georges Hedare (Lambert Wilson) and his villainous but beautiful wife Laurel (Sharon Stone). When Patience stumbles across a conspiracy within the company regarding a new anti-aging beauty cream, she is promptly flushed out of life. A mysterious Egyptian Mau cat whom Patience helped comes to her aid and resurrects her, bestowing upon her the sleek abilities of a cat. Patience then must come to terms with her new persona while tackling the Hedare Corporation and her love interest, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt).

 This film exhibits all the perfect qualities of a fun superhero type film. Many people have considered ""Spiderman 2"" the ultimate comic book film. Well, every aspect of ""Spiderman 2"" is present ""Catwoman"". Patience must deal with the duality of her life, her good side and bad side, and also must find a happy medium between her old self and new self. This film is all about accepting oneself for who you are and empowering the freedom that accompanies acceptance, even though the outside world may not take a liking to you. Patience also walks the fine line of good and bad, which is something new to the superhero bit. You don't see Spiderman stealing expensive jewelry, but Catwoman certainly has no problem with it. This aspect makes Patience more of an anti-heroine, someone who isn't necessarily a good guy in the traditional sense, but still exudes a charisma that makes them likable.

 The special effects are great, the fight scenes are splendidly choreographed, and the exhilirating score by Klaus Badelt adds a very rhythmic drive to the already thrilling film.

 The lack of historical accuracy as far as Catwoman goes gives this film an edge. We saw Selina Kyle played brilliantly by Michelle Pfeiffer in ""Batman Returns"". It would have been out of place to start completely over with Selina. She had her time out as Catwoman, and now it's Patience's turn. This is Catwoman's fresh start. Selina is still prominent in the comic books, but that doesn't mean that she can be the only Catwoman. The non-traditional outfit also fits marvelously. It gives Catwoman an edge. She is a new-found woman showcasing her primal side, which can very much include sexuality. Her outfit is indicative of her metamorphosis. If one were to transform from lovable loser to feisty feline it would definately include a darker, edgier, sexier look. One final note on the costume: regardless of what some have said, there is nothing pornographic about this film. Sexuality is prevalent, but that is a very far cry from flat out porn.

 Summer seasons tend to run rampant with strong, superhero-type films with very powerful leading characters. In a summer populated by Hugh Jackman, Brad Pitt, and Tobey Maguire it is overly refreshing to see Halle Berry thrown into the mix, not to mention Sharon Stone. This has been my favorite summer film. It's all about acceptance, freedom, and power, which are all very real aspects of life that we all could learn to handle. ""Catwoman"" does the perfect job of showing these life lessons in a very fun way. Meow!",1091232000,6,3541,4.946127946127946

well there wrong don't listen!!! This movie is really good. I have read alot of these reviews just taring up this movie because its not how they want it. 1st they say that selena kyle is the only catwoman. thats understandable but they just made there own interpretation of catwoman and introuced her with a new origin and as a different person. This has nothing to do with the original catwoman. Its a whole new story. Another one i heard was it was a mistake leaving batman out of it. Read the title clearly: CATWOMAN. Its not called batman 5 or catwoman and batman. if u wanna see batman wait till BATMAN BEGINS to come out. also let me point out that the original catwoman had no super powers and halle berry's does. the reason why is because the original catwoman wouldnt have been a good movie the fact that this catwoman has super powers gives her an edge. the original catwoman has 9 live WOW. anyway this is a totally different story and its a good movie w/ a good story to it.so let me tell you, if ur gonna go into the movie and want 2 see the original catwoman you know your gonna slam the movie. this one is much better than the original catwoman.

1190016,2,B0000060X7,"First let's get this out of the way - yes, they changed the origin of Catwoman, and no, I'm not a devotee of the comic, so you can't blame the bad review on that.

Catwoman has the slick shiny feel of so many successful comic-based movies but lacks the interesting character insights and extrapolations most of them have.  As freaky as Michelle Pfieffer's Catwoman from Batman Returns was, this one is more so.  The Catwoman personality comes out as an almost schizophrenic hyperactive second personality, complete with cliched posturing and dialogue.  Other than that, we have cardboard cut-out characters - Halle Berry as the pretty-and-talented-but-unconfident artist, her chubby-and-horny co-worker/gal-pal, the charming-disarming-and-sincere detective played by Benjamin Bratt, the over-the-hill-model-turned-vindictive-psycho played by Sharon Stone, the evil-business-partner-and-cheating-husband co-villain, the friendly-cat-woman-information source - all characters I've seen before, played with more personality.  It isn't that the actors don't do a good job - it's that they do a great job following a director who has neglected the humanity of the characters.

Also throw in a badly written script (dialogue tends to land with a *crash* *ka-thump*) and unnecessary special effects (just because you can show people rushing around via time lapse photography doesn't mean you should) and the movie is a great candidate for Mystery Science Theater 3000.

1190017,4,B0000060X7,"Let me start off by saying that the movie is good. A Spiderman 2 it is not, however, that doesn't make it any less of a movie.

 The idea is not to draw comparisons to Spiderman, he's a totally different type of 'hero' The movie had good special effects, good fight scenes, and good casting with Stone and Berry. Yes, she is going up against a Cosmetics Company and not a scientist with titanium arms welded to his spine that is hellbent on destroying the world. But so what! This is the first movie so it will naturally delves into the origin of catwoman so most people are going to be wanting more. Berry makes an excellent catwoman. I, like most people grew up with the Kingpin and Green Lantern being caucasian and the only minorities being Apache Chief and Black Vulcan so even I raise an eyebrow when I see the hero being recast. However, Berry and Clarke Duncan (Kingpin) both did excellent jobs. If we are going to bad mouth a movie b/c it isn't to the letter exactly like the comics then let's not forget Spiderman can not shoot webs out of his wrist unless he has web cartridges. Go see Catwoman and judge for yourself.

 Critics seem to have difficulty rating movies based on comics b/c I personally believe none fully understand comic book characters in general.

Halle Berry really kicks butt once she totally transforms into Catwoman.  I absolutely love the scene in the techno club!  Whoever came up with that is a pure genius.  Sharon Stone was great too.  She always plays an exceptional villain!

The only bad thing about the movie was that the script could have been written a tad bit better, and they should have not used the CGI cat to give Patience her purr-fect powers.  They should have done something similar to what happened to Michelle Pfeiffer in BATMAN RETURNS.  Once the transformation takes place, and the action gets going, this becomes a great movie!  Of course, make sure to go when there aren't obnoxious kids whose fathers don't know how to parent attending also.

1190020,3,B0000060X7,"Yes, I have read all the reviews in such publications as People Weekly and USA Today, and I am aware that it has been widely panned. However, while I will admit that it is not the best movie ever made, and does not have the something-for-everybody appeal that Spider-Man 2 has, Catwoman deserves a fair chance.

 Halle Berry plays the mousy, insecure Patience Philips, whom after coming across some incriminating evidence, is killed by her boss, played by Sharon Stone. However, a bunch of cats find her dead body, and bring her back to life (i.e. a cat has nine lives). After this, Patience becomes the sexy confident Catwoman, whom has many catlike qualities (such as being very sleek and subtle one moment and savage the next, landing on her feet after falling from a high height, and being able to jump long distances to name others).

 Berry and Stone are both very good in their respective roles, and while the action and special effects are very watchable after that, the story falls apart. The whole ""problem"" she is trying to solve (every superhero has one in a film) is just plain ridiculous. Benjamin Bratt, who plays her boyfriend, and the woman who plays her horny best friend are both totally wasted in this, almost tempting me to shout at the movie screen ""Why are they even there?!"" One final flaw is that Catwoman is half good and half evil, placing the audience in an awkward position since they don't know whether they should be routing for her, or routing against her.

 This movie is far from perfect; it will probably win more Razzies than Oscars, Golden Globes, or even People's Choice awards, and the chances of a sequel or good box office seem highly unlikely at this point. However, I do believe the film deserves a fair chance. I will warn you, though, that going to the film with high expectations will only dissapoint you.",1090886400,4,1851,4.662576687116564

We are not talking Cinema Noire here! We're talking about a film about a comic book character, and she played the Catwoman very well. The scene with the catnip and the fish in the aquarium were just the right touches to show her 'catness'. I would have liked to see a little more action or fight scenes in the movie, but all in all I say to Halle Berry 'you go girl!' The people who are panning Halle and her career are jealous and small minded. Let her have her due. She is doing well with her career, and the Catwoman is an honestly enjoyable film.",1090886400,2,712,4.129496402877698

 The movie consisted of some cool special effects, an amazing intro, an interesting story-board, some very good ideas & facts, Satisfactory acting and overall, had realistic view of things. ""CATWOMAN"" has always been my favourite superhero & I completely went along with the whole idea of recreating her. It just made it a whole lot easier & more facinating! I mean, who the f**k wants 2 c Batman in the movie? Gotham city? A lame-ass story??? 4 crying out loud, this movie was fine. The best superhero movie...yet! The only problem was that there wasn't enough info regarding certain aspects of the plot, which is probably why I think the book will be better. Books can be long...but movies can't. My only advice 2 anyone that reads this is 2 not trust the REVIEWS!!!And Im not just refering it 2 ""CATWOMAN"", but 2 all movies with bad reviews in general...",1090886400,3,863,4.71523178807947

  The plot isn't bad but it, too, is ... a bit off.  Benjamin Bratt is cute, but he's no Batman, who is Catwoman's main 'friendly enemy'.  Bratt is  believable as a cop who romances Patience, & quite the nice bit of eye-candy he is.  & Halle Berry *rocks* as the put-upon Patience who's reborn - from the breath of an Egyptian Mau cat, no less! - into a more ferocious, feral creature.  The flip-flop between the sweet [but steamrollable] Patience & her feline counterpart works.  So does the hissable evil of Sharon Stone as the Bad Girl; Stone must've had a *blast* doing this film.

  All in all, a good movie; it's just regretable that it didn't have better FX.  In a summer with -Spider-man 2-, the Tale of the Cat Who Walks as a Woman should've been *much* better than this.

  At least Catwoman wasn't turned into a softie ... but then, that's the whole point of -Catwoman-.  Power *is* Freedom!",1090886400,,1091,4.424242424242424
1190024,5,B0000060X7,"It appears that the viewing audience in general was disappointed in the movie Catwoman because it didn't fit some comic book or previously portrayed cat women.  Some have even commented that it was distastefully done, lacking in real feeling or action, since this was supposed to be an action hero.

It's too bad these people didn't pay closer attention to the finer details and use their imaginations to dig a little deeper while watching this movie.

I was enchanted from the very beginning with all the hieroglyphics, the quick innuendo of previous cat women, the introduction of the Egyptian Mau, the possibility of it's mythical powers, and the introduction of how Patience could possibly become a cat woman herself with the story beginning at her death. Was everybody still getting their popcorn while all the above was taking place and that's why they lack understanding?

Also the fact that Ms. Berry is a black woman seemed to be an issue for some reviewers.  Black, white, purple, I don't care!  She presented the woman as a cat extremely well with her body being buff instead of pencil thin.  And I particularly enjoyed watching all her stealth cat-like, well choreographed twists, turns, and graceful, yet sensuous movements.  It made me a believer that she was indeed part human part cat.

This is not a comic book movie; it goes much deeper.  I give this movie two thumbs up.",1090886400,4,1389,4.8474576271186445
1190025,5,B0000060X7,"Okay, so I know most people who hate it are complaining that it doesn't stick with Catwoman's original story. So? I liked the aspect of having Patience, unsure of herself and shy, kind of seperate from the confident Catwoman and having the two come together in the end. The whole Egyptian Mau history was interesting and I liked having it in there. I also loved her feline powers and the way she moved like a cat; kneading the sheets, leaping about with perfect balance, dropping to all fours, rocking her hips, and having that feline agility. The cgs could have been better, but if you ignore that, you can really appreciate the movie.

1190027,1,B0000060X7,"This movie is probably one of the worst of the year thus far. After seeing it, I just sat there staring off into space wondering what the director and editor were taking when they made this film. Halle Berry had a shot of starring in a decent adaption of Catwoman. However, the creative forces behind the film couldn't give the film a breath of life or freshness. Instead, we get the bare-bones of an okay story. The editing is horrible and there are so many times when continuity through character expression is shifty. I agree, they could of made a good Catwoman film and still disconnected it with the Batman franchise. However, instead we got a blur of just another hollywood flop. My advice to Halle: Get a new agent. My advice to Pitoff: Stick to directing commercials, because that's all you'll be remembered for at the end of the day.",1090886400,4,842,4.582781456953643

So I watched it and I really enjoyed it -- it was better than I expected it to be. I never followed the Catwoman comics nor cartoons, but this version was extraordinary. The movie contains an interesting story, great special effects, demonstrates the Capoeira martial art style really well, and most importantly Halle Berry in a Black Leather Cat Suit.

Unless one looks for the deeper side, I can possibly see why the experts may have found this movie amiss. They've no doubt become dulled by the piles of other action films and action heros.

 In Catwoman, I believe that Halle Berry's acting abilities have matured. She was and is believable as a cat/woman. Having said that, let's examine first, this may not have been the best written film and some of the actions and details may be missing, nevertheless, this movie fulfills a deeper need.

 I see it as a true chick flick. It gives the feminine gender something more to go on in establishing the fullness of who we are, breaking the old standards of either good girls or bad girls, that we can all have some of both and have fun while we're at it.

 I took my granddaughter with me to see this movie and she and I concur this is a film worth seeing. It is a movie that should help to broaden the perspective of just what women can be, both in standing up for ourselves and yet being beautiful inside and out, just like the idealized cat.

1190030,1,B0000060X7,"Yes, you've heard it time and again, this version of ""Catwoman"" takes liberties with the original storyline: Catowman's name isn't Selina Kyle, She's good rather than bad, and, sadly, the Catwoman costume is kind of laughable -- especially the pointy head.

 But even if you overlook how this movie strays from the traditional storyline, it still doesn't stand on its own. It's poorly acted -- overacted in many parts (Sharon Stone is particularly ""evil""), the plot is weak (killer make-up? Very similar to the plot the Joker tried to launch in the first Batman), and there are several plot holes. For instance, why does Patience go back to work at the company whose goons just killed her?

 The real focus of the film doesn't appear to be storyline (which is weak at best), but how Halle Berry fills out her cat suit, built for optimum cleavage. Not necessarily a bad thing, but to make it the focus of your movie? Sorry, Pitof, sexy suits will only carry a movie so far.",1090800000,4,972,4.666666666666667

The irony of this movie was sharron stone played more of the roll of the real cat woman then Halle did. This is the dumbest conversion of comic to movie I've ever seen. Cat woman is evil you dorks!

How to make this movie a success?

Give it the R rating. Make her brutally rip people apart. Make her reign the city as the major leading for, then end the movie with batman ending her reign (not that I'm a batman fan)

What I did care about was how bad this movie is. This movie is right up there with Gigli as one of the worst movies ever made. The plot is reaaly stupid. Halle Berry's character Patience works for a cosmetics company who is making a dangerous product that will turn women's faces into burn victims if they stop using it. Patience finds this out and is killed by some goons who work for the company. Patience is then brought back to life by an ugly cat who breathes into her mouth. The stupid thing is she comes back to work the next day and noone at the company apparently bothered to find out who it was they killed and noone says anything. Catwoman then starts to act like a cat with really stupid looking cheesy special effects. Compare them to Spider-Man 2 and you will see what I mean. Where did the 100 million go into this movie? I don't see it on the screen. Halle and her love interest in the movie Benjamin Bratt have zero onscreen chemistry. A lot of the movie is extremely boring. This is like if the Lifetime channel for women made a superhero movie. True I think women may like this more than men. My girlfriend is black and she made me go see this to support Halle Berry who she is a fan of and even she admitted the movie was not very good. I enjoyed Halle in some other movies but this performance is a joke. I know a lot of people will go see this because Halle Berry looks good in the outfit. I can't blame them for that. That would be the only reason to see this movie. The soundtrack was awful also like areally bad R&B video. Especially bad was a scene of Patience and Benjamin Bratt's character playing basketball. Holy cheeseball was that lame!! Guess what she beats him! Wow that is funny! NOT!!! Without a doubt the worst movie I have seen in a longtime.,1090713600,12,1958,4.2520107238605895

I loved the scene where Catwoman was cracking her whip in the middle of that techno club. Scenes like that worked because it was able to stand on its own. On the flipside, the CGI effects were awful. It was like watching an X-box game on the big screen. The CGI cat that ""re-awakens"" patience was equally terrible and I was a bit bummed that the cat did not stick its head in her mouth liek the one in Batman Returns.

1190036,1,B0000060X7,"In the wild world of cinema, we're living in an age of comic heroes -- Spiderman, Hellboy, Daredevil, the Hulk, the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and now... ""Catwoman.""Sadly, this film is just an excuse to have Halle Berry purr around in a leather dominatrix outfit.

 Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) is a mild-mannered, rather dull woman in an ordinary job at a massive cosmetics firm. But one day she has the misfortune to hear her bosses talking about a new beauty product -- it causes the skin to disintegrate if you stop using it, but they don't plan to recall it. But when Patience is caught, they kill her and flush away her body in a wash of toxic waste. Enter Egyptian deity cat, who resurrects her and endows her with catty powers and a new punky attitude.

 Like any superhero worth her scanty leather catsuit (no pun), the reborn Catwoman wants to kick the behinds of the people who did this to her. But her ex-boss Laurel Hedare (past-her-prime ex-bombshell Sharon Stone) has a secret of her own -- cosmetic cream that makes her skin hard (Botox, anyone?). Can Catwoman thwart the evildoers? Will anyone care?

 It's difficult to understand why the talented, beautiful, Oscar-winning Halle Berry would attach herself to this ghastly, almost unredeemable story. There is literally nothing worth checking out in ""Catwoman,"" unless you happen to be a hormone-raddled teen boy whose only plot requirement involves Berry in kitty dominatrix gear. (Complete with whip!)

 The dialogue is truly horrendous. Berry is reduced to reciting lame one-liners like ""I'm bad, but only as bad as I wanna be."" Director Pitof relies heavily on T&A shots of Berry bouncing around and slinking seductively over rooftops, not to mention the bad CGI shots. Perhaps worst of all, Pitof overuses the silly ""cat"" element -- we're treated to shots of Berry sleeping on the roof, licking up tuna, snorting catnip. It's funny, but not meant to be.

 Berry really does seem to be trying. But she can't hope to overcome the script and direction, It's all the more tragic because she has the presence and smoldering quality to make the role sexy and complex. Benjamin Bratt is utterly forgettable as Catwoman's cop boyfriend. And Sharon Stone's big comeback just reaffirms the obvious: She can't act. She struts through every scene reciting her lines in a robotic voice (""Now I can... kill you."")

 ""Catwoman"" is a cat-astrophe. With ghastly acting -- despite the best efforts of Berry -- a putrid script and a ridiculous director, this is undoubtedly among the worst films of 2004.",1090627200,68,2567,4.916666666666667

Halle looked smokin'in her outfit and put her all into the film. Certainly she's not going to be getting an Oscar for it but..... I hope Catwoman does respectably in the box office stats because its not all that bad. What were people expecting? Pulp Fiction? Reservoir Dogs? It's Catwoman, the name should explain itself. It's not brainfood and you don't have to evaluate your life after it but hey, people need that once in a while. It's a fun movie... give it a chance and stop with the over the top,unfair, mellow dramatic criticism. The action is decent enough, but I didn't like the way the director did a lot of the fight scenes; the camera was way too close to get any real sense of Catwoman's fighting style most of the time, and the editing was choppy. I did like the chemistry between Halle and Benjamin, though, and Alex Borstein is funny as Patience's best friend. Oh, I really enjoyed seeing Sharon Stone playing a bad-ass bitch again.

1190039,2,B0000060X7,"Since this movies conception, there have been numerous references to Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in the 1992 classic Batman Returns. 2004's Catwoman has absolutely nothing to do with either Batman, his villians, nor any resemblence to that Catwoman character. Questions have been raised wondering whether Halle Berry could fill the same role as Pfeiffer. Well, in my opinion, no. The depth of acting it took for this incarnation was more geared to martial arts and being sexy in leather. Don't take it wrong, Halle Berry, an excellent actress, wasn't given any true depth of character to work with.

The movie seems to be divided into halves. The first part deals with Patience Philips working for a cosmetic company as an art designer who just can't seem to get anything right when it comes to her boss. What began promising at first, turned into a disaster when Catwoman finally arrived about 40 minutes into the film. This second half lost the story with a barrage of leaps and fights mixed with a loose love story.

There are a few resemblences to Batman Returns, and maybe these were a nod to it:

1. Halle Berry turns towards the camera, crouched delivering the same Meow! as Pfeiffer's character.

2. Catwoman, always letting her curiousity rule, goes into a store, where instead of meeting 2 security guards as Pfeiffer's did, she meets 3 robbers.

3. Catwoman stands in front of the moon.

4. Catwoman nearly falls out the window, and later on, is almost pushed out the window.

The references are there, but for anyone who hasn't seen Batman Returns, you wouldn't notice them. There are a few more nods, but I think the point is delivered.

So, what's this story all about? Well, if anyone has seen the trailer to Resident Evil: Apocalypse, then you would have the story in a nutshell. In the trailer to RE2 (due this Fall) there's a facial cream that rots your skin and its side effects are toxic. (Funny, I was reminded as well of The Jokers mixture of poisonous toxins he shipped from his factory to shelves in 1989's Batman.)

Ok, we have the fired employee who is killed because she found out about the evil corporations secret. A cat performs CPR (or so that's what it looks like), and she comes back to life. There isn't a comic book villian in this movie, ala Joker, Penguin, or Doc Ock (Spider-Man 2). What we have is the ruthless and completely flat corporate executives. There's no depth to these villians and no clever schemes to nab Catwoman, only pin a few deaths on her. There's your story ladies and gentlemen and I think you can pretty much figure out how it turns out.

In the beginning, there was so much promise. From the opening credits showing the origins of cats in myth and legend to the meeting she has with the owner of Midnight (the cat who performed CPR.) After that, it was a downhill spiral. I will say that the catsuit was nice and very revealing, however the headpiece looks really odd. Catwoman got her claws from Tiffany's I think (they really do look like designer nails).

I have to say, in all fairness, that Catwoman in Batman Returns was a lot more real and the character had a purpose. From her stitched up suit to her makeshift claws. Some may think I was going into this movie with a preception of Catwoman from Batman, but I did not. I had followed this movie since it was first announced and knew it was not the same. I also knew it had nothing to do with the Dark Knight, but I did expect one thing...a good story for the money. Halle Berry is better than a walkthrough part and deserves a good script, she's proven herself as a fine actress. Nothing is really explained in the movie and it's loosely tied together between action sequences and sex appeal.

To see, or not to see, that is the question. The answer is up to you.",1090627200,,3782,4.578402366863905

You gotta kick someone's azz if they kill you (or try to). Not only did she solve the crime, but she does a nice job at getting her own revenge. I do think the movie is a little slow and what not, but I also think it is good at the same time. I'll see it at least one more time. I need to see the parts I missed because of using the bathroom. All in all, wihtout giving away the story I think it's a nice movie for the family to see.",1090627200,,567,3.7333333333333334

 Don't blame Halle Berry for this, even though she starts out the movie tellingly ""dead in the water."" She proved in ""Monster's Ball"" that she can act. And she looks great in this movie. But I didn't buy her for one second as Catwoman. And I didn't buy her boring romance with Benjamin Bratt either. It just wasn't sexy.

 Blame Pitof, who was likely responsible for the non-stop camera movement, the constant editing, the computer-animated cat who mounts Halle to revive her from the dead and the overall emphasis of style over substance. I swear, this movie gets so out-of-control with its editing at times that I fear for any epileptics going to the theater. ""Catwoman"" will cause seizures.

 Poor Sharon Stone doesn't even deserve this. Though she fares well in the final fight scene, not that you can ever tell anything that happens in any of the fight scenes, she's given ridiculously over-the-top scenes to play out using every histrionic possible. Her costuming is ugly. She's freakishly overlit in every scene in the movie. And the plot twist involving makeup that somehow makes her invincible is just plain stupid.

 This whole mess is far from ""purr-fect."" So far from perfect, in fact, that I laughed out loud when the thing ended.",1090540800,5,1423,4.779591836734694
1190042,1,B0000060X7,"I saw this movie today, somewhat expecting to be disappointed because this is getting really bad review, but three friends and I went out to see it anyway. We should've seen ""Farenheight 9/11"" instead...

 This is a bad movie. From reading over reviews I see that a lot of people don't like it because it doesn't follow the comic's story or whatever, and I can see how that can be a p*sser to hardcore fans, but I've never really read any comics so I don't even know what the original story is.

 I do know that the story in this particular movie is ridicoulus.

 Patience Phillips is an average woman, with dreams she has yet to achieve and a job she hates. She's clumsy, too. One day, she sees a cat, I think it's name is Midnight. Anyway, Midnight is apparently trapped on top of Patience's apartment roof. Patience gets out on the roof to try and save the cat, but almost kills herself. Some cop sees that she's about to fall off the roof, and, thinking she's a jumper, goes up and saves her. Everything gets cleared up, he realizes she's not a jumper, they take a likin' to each other, etc. That night, Patience has to deliver something to her work, so she goes there, and the front door is locking, so she goes around and goes through the door that says ""Warning: Keep Out"" or something like that, which just happens to be unlocked. She stumbles upon her bosses conversation, her boss hears her, they kill her. The conversation, by the way, was about how even though they knew that a side-effect of a new beauty cream their company is producing has horrible side-effects, they're not going to pull it off the shelves for money's sake. Patience is reserrected by a few ancient cats or something like that and she comes back to life with cat-like powers.

 Now, the ridicoulus plot is not the only bad thing. The pace of the movie is worse. I mean, it moves along WAY too fast. Patience and her cop boyfriend never really have any character develepmont as a couple (actually, the cop doesn't have much development at all) and before you even know it, Halle's running around in leather, which is the film's highlight, though.

 The villians in this movie aren't anything special either. Sharon Stone plays a psycho woman who's used some sort of a cream for a long time and she's invincible. Of course, her and Catwoman only battle once and it's extremely short, and to say the least, a lot less that dynamic.

 Also, the action is pretty bland. There's not really much of it...probably one scene between Catwoman and bankrobbers which lasts about a minute and a half and the final scene between her and Sharon Stone's character. But the action is nothing you haven't seen before, just the usual computer effects and flashy camera angles, and the usual start and stop, fast moving editing.

 So, yeah. This could have been a way better movie. Halle Barry is definelty hot a hell in her Catwoman outfit, but is that worth $7.50? This movie would have been a lot cooler if Batman was in it. But the preview of the new Exorcist was awesome.",1090540800,11,3039,4.53199268738574
1190043,1,B0000060X7,"Just got back from the theater... my God I really don't see how this movie could be worse. I'm not going to write a book, but let me just point out a few of the things that makes this a bad movie:

Halle Berry isn't at the top of her game in this movie. I didn't find her acting convincing in most scenes.

Catwoman in this movie is killed by corporate execs and brought back to life by a magical cat to seek revenge against the evil doers... Uh, the Crow called, he wants his plot back.

The cinematographers use blurs and brief shots to try and hide the terrible 3D animation. The graphics and movement look like a video game and are not very realistic. Some of the cats were realistic.

Halle Berry's boyfriend doesn't catch on that he's dating Catwoman even though she:

a) looks just like catwoman without the little ears

b) performs supernatural feats that only a Catwoman could do

and

c) has the same handwriting as catwoman

What a moron!

The cinematography was just awful with constant split second takes and bizarre looking crane shots that may have been poorly computer generated.

The last thing that I can think of that makes this a God-Awful movie is Sharon Stone:

Sharon Stone in this movie plays a corporate executive who's evil power is HARD SKIN DUE TO COSMETIC PRODUCT SIDE EFFECTS! Yes, you heard me right, this super villain's super power is sickness due to her beauty cream. To top it all off, this model slash business woman kicks catwomans ass at the end! I would like to think that a female model and corporate exec couldn't take me...

1190044,5,B0000060X7,"OK, I'll admit to some rating inflation, this is actually closer to 4  stars.  It's a good movie, not a great movie.

Halle Berry plays Patience Phillips, who is _A_ Catwoman, not Selena Kyle, _THE_ Catwoman of Batman fame.  She is the protagonist, not he heroine, of this movie.  She is a deeply flawed character, she's a thief, but not a killer.

There are no twist or surprises in this movie, every plot development telegraphs the next one as it unfolds with the inevitability of a Greek Tragedy.  Berry and Stone both give good performances, and Benjamin Bratt plays the police detective with just the right amount of vulnerability (but his character was perhaps a little too close to the one he played on Law & Order).

Fight scenes were well choreographed, special effects and computer animation are almost seamless.

1190045,1,B0000060X7,"If you want to see a comic book-based movie, go see Spiderman 2 or just rent one. The Catwoman in this movie is NOT the Catwoman from the comic book. The comic book character is a woman named Selina Kyle who lives in Gotham City and is nothing more than a cat-burglar turned vigilante. She has no super powers and she was never brought back from the dead. The Catwoman in THIS movie is NOT the Catwoman from the comic. If someone is going to make a movie based on a comic book character, he/she has a responsibility to the fans of that character to stay true to the identity and spirit of the character. Plus, for all you who erroneously believe this is a racial issue, get off your high horse and see the issue for what it really is, which is a very unfaithful take on the character of Catwoman. There was a black woman who portrayed Catwoman in the old Adam West series, but despite the racial difference, she stayed true to the character (likewise for the character of Kingpin in Daredevil). If the spirit of the character is there, then the adaption can be considered a faithful rendering. This movie, however, is very unfaithful, and I only hope it doesn't destroy the possibility of a real Catwoman movie being made sometime in the future. Again, for all of you who erroneously believe this is a racial issue: ask yourself this: do you want to see a Robin Hood movie, but instead of an english outlaw, how about making him a Mexican who has been genetically altered to fight crime in Tijuana? Yeah, think about THAT!!! ... now go read a Catwoman comic book so you REALLY know who Catwoman is!!!",1090540800,12,1600,4.445578231292517
1190046,4,B0000060X7,"Halle Berry is a fabulous Catwoman, but she needs more to do than what they gave her here. As Patience Phillips she is a beautiful but not very confident artist in the ad department of a cosmetics corporation on the verge of releasing a defective product. The product: Beau-line has one small problem in that it's addictive, causes headaches, and will cause serious deformities to the user upon cessation of use.

  The corporation is run by a nasty Sharon Stone and her greedy husband. When Patience accidentally learns of the beauty cream's flaw she is flushed into the harbor. Dead, her body is found by an Egyptian Mau cat, endowed with the ability to transfer catlike abilities to a human host. Thus, Patience becomes Catwoman.

  While reluctantly exploiting her abilities Patience becomes enamored with a police detective played by Benjamin Bratt. He learns of her secret identity after Stone frames her for a couple of murders. Rest assured, Stone eventually gets her comeuppance.

  The best parts of this movie come when Patience flexes her cat muscles and breaks away from her nebbishness. Looking great in the leather costume Berry has some great CG acrobatic scenes. All in all a great way to spend a summer afternoon, though watered down for the ladies. This is a superhero movie minus the testosterone. Enjoy.",1090540800,3,1324,4.95475113122172

A cat has 9 lives and comes in all shades, shapes,...sizes....etc. Get with the program people. Anybody can play anybody as long as they are an excellent actor who can bring out that character...for us to relate to. Color of the actor/actress....is...unimportant. Those of you who are saying..""ANYTHING"" about color of an actor/actress....are racially biased pigs. Whether you realize it or not. I am sick of it already. Move on. Open your mind.

 What you should be concerned with is, was this a good movie. Did it move you. Did you express emotion during this film. And take this movie for its own merit. Do not compare to others. THIS IS AN ADAPTATION. It is loosely based on comic books. It is not word for word...exact replica of any comic I have ever read. I collected all the Batman, Superman, Incredible Hulk, Catwoman, X-Men ... etc.. comics as a kid. Today, almost any movie you see is an adaptation if it is not completely based on a true story.

I have little interest in seeing the same story basically repeated for the third or fourth time.  I can't criticize WB for choosing Halle Berry.  With her as CW, it is absolutely certain they will make more money than they would if they had chosen ANY other woman for the role.  They will make lots of money even if the movie is not very good.  The easiest mistake for them to make would be to way go overboard portraying her as a Sex Symbol.  It may be tough to avoid that with that costume, given the fact that she is, in fact, a Sex Symbol to many, many people.

1190056,4,B0000060X7,"I went to a test screening of this film this weekend in LA, and while I am not supposed to talk about it, I can at least assure you of some aspects of the film.
Catwoman is ""cattier"" than hell, and Halle Berry truely pulls out all the stops to try and make this film work. Visually, its fun and exciting. it is very reminiscant of the first Charlie's Angels film - A fun little action film that goes for thrill after thrill to keep you entralled. But the story, while sometimes lacking true depth, also captures you. It really is an oddly fun film.
Many of Catwoman's little one-liners throughout the film do get old, and despite the promising outline, much of the writing is too contrived, and without any natural flow. This is too bad, seeing as it has many other promising aspects.
The film is also too long. The version we were shown was 2 hours and 36 minutes, but having been to test screenings before this, I am sure that there will be more editing done - as there always is.
This rating is not for the final picture - it would be premature to make any judgments of the film until it was released - There is plenty of tweaking to be done to Catwoman. But I can assure you,  not matter what they do, It will be one fun and exciting summer flick - Just don't expect an amazing deal of depth.",1088380800,5,1296,4.225806451612903
1190057,1,B0000060X7,"The Motion Picture Association of Arts & Sciences will be knocking on Halle Berry's front door taking back the Oscar that she was awarded back in 2002, for her role in ""Monster's Ball"", once ""Catwoman"" is unleashed in theaters.
Pointless film that has nothing to do with the ""Batman"" villianess of the same name. Berry stars as a woman who loves cats & after a fatal drowning turns into a human cat, complete with superhuman feline prowess. Sharon Stone co-stars as the main villianess, that Berry seeks to claim vengence upon.
I've seen the film and it sucks. Big time. It was a bad idea to turn away from the legendary story of Catwoman (Catwoman is a master burglar & overall thief in the ""Batman"" comics) and try to take a different more mystical, superhero route with it. After ""Batman Returns"" came out in the summer 1992, it was quite a hot idea to have a spin-off film with the femme feline in her own film. But, with Michelle Pfeiffer passing on the project early on (she was the original Cat in ""Batman Returns"". She was hot too!) & the death of the Batman franchise, thanks to the stinkie, cheese bomb that is known as ""Batman & Robin"", who the hell cares !?!

1190058,1,B0000060X7,"Thought Van Helsing was the worst we would see this summer? Think again. Here comes Halle Berry in, what could be, the first huge failure of the summer, both critically and financially. Avoid this one at all costs folks. From the very start, the very idea of basing a film on a Batman villian was a bad idea. Turning her into a hero with super powers (catwoman has no powers, she's just at skilled theif) was a big mistake. With plenty of Marvel Films out there as great examples of HOW to do comic book films, WB's of course thinks they know better. Creating a film that is a mere shadow of the original character.
The supporting cast is also filled with terrible choices. Sharon Stone, Benjamin Bratt. When was the last time they made a good film? Remember Halle Berry and her terrible Storm perforomance in X-MEN? Have you SEEN Gothika? She should have her oscar ravoked for those atrocities.

1190059,5,B0000060X7,"After nearly a decade, Warner Bros. has finally found a comic book character who is worthy to be put back on the silver screen. No, not Batman, but close...Catwoman. And as you can see on Amazon.com's movie poster, the role has been given to Halle Berry.
The movie which opens nationwide this July, has unfortunately broken away from the comic book mythology. In the comics, Catwoman was a skilled thief with catlike tendencies. She dressed in a cat-suit and her name was Selina Kyle. In the film, her background is completely ignored and has been drastically changed. Patience Phillips (Berry) is a lowly executive assistant at a huge conglomerate. When she stumbles upon the dark secrets of her boss, her employer kills her...or tries. Patience then takes revenge as the leather wearing, whip-wielding Catwoman.
There is no Gotham City, and there is no Batman. There is no Batmobile and there is no Alfred. Just Catwoman fighting her ex-boss in some futuristic city. This has caused a lot of controversy being that things have been altered.
 ''We're not saying this is Catwoman,'' Berry enlightened in a magazine interview, ''I'm my own incarnation, not to be compared to the others.'' The others in which she is referring to consist of the sultry Eartha Kitt who portrayed the feline foe in the 1960's Batman television series; and the beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer who played the part in Tim Burtons 1992 masterpiece Batman Returns.
Directed by French executive Pitof of 1997's Alien Resurrection, the production cost 100 million and features Lambert Wilson as the main enemy, Sharon Stone as the wife of the evil tycoon and Benjamin Bratt as Patience's boyfriend.
The movie has been kept very confidential, and only a few pictures of Halle has been revealed for the public. As if the film isn't getting enough criticism, Berry's costume is getting the cold shoulder as well. Clad in a stomach revealing outfit equipped with ripped up leather pants, high heeled shoes, a leather bra and nifty looking cat-mask, Berry is redefining the Catwoman character.
Despite controversy, I think the film looks promising. Halle has appeared on Oprah and Ellen, and the audience appaered to have loved it. Sharon Stone also showed several clips from the movie, and I must say she looks very evil! Who knows, maybe all of this controversy will fall flat when the film hits theaters. If the movie does well this could provide Berry with a Catwoman series. However, if things go bad, Berry could be facing a major blockbuster flop. Me-OW!",1085875200,4,2524,4.966903073286052
