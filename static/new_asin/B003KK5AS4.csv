4133875,1,B003KK5AS4,"I have screen burn-in on my 47"" LCD TV.  Bought this DVD to avoid buying a new TV.  I made the contrast and brightness changes as instructed and ran the various programs for the required 30 minutes.  No, or slight improvement in the picture.  Then, I ran 2 of the programs overnight for a couple of days.  No improvement!  Don't buy this product.  I'm waiting for my new 47"" from Amazon.  I'm giving this one to my nephew, who's just starting out with his own home.",1328400000,,465,4.325581395348837
4133876,2,B003KK5AS4,"On the calibration patterns, the PLUGE is WAY off, at least when compared to both Avia and Digital Video Essentials, two longstanding standards.

Second and more importantly, the ""Snow Cycle"" wash pattern displays with black bars on the edges, even when anamorphic mode is forced. I use a scaler with an overscan control, so I was able to zoom this pattern in. But, this is not how it should display.

These to me are serious defects.",1276732800,4,434,4.697368421052632

8398746,1,B003KK5AS4,I'd give it no stars but I guess that isn't an option. Had slight signs of burn in on my LCD. This disc absolutely  made it worse. One 30 min Cycle and what was  there was darker by far.,1450137600,,186,3.7435897435897436

8398751,1,B003KK5AS4,I've used the Dvd twice and the Tv still has black zig zag line down one side and has since got a fine dark line started on the right side of the screen. Would definitely not recommend.,1359158400,3,185,4.027027027027027
8398752,1,B003KK5AS4,"Look, I never write negative reviews but this product seriously didn't fix ANYTHING and in fact, after using this bootleg DVD my TV got WORSE. I had one dead pixel in the middle of my TV before I bought this DVD, after using it.. I had 4 more dead pixels than before and slight burn in. After buying this DVD.. it is apparent that after a year of having my beautiful Samsung 55"" TV with one dead pixel, I gotta buy a new TV and scrap this one...smh. Bottom line.. read the rest of the reviews and don't waste your money.",1355184000,4,520,4.158415841584159
