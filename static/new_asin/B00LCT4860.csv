Therefore the 5 star rating.",1529193600,,99,4.2105263157894735
8665212,5,B00LCT4860,"This is a very well done story about the massacre at Monte Sole.  The film uses English subtitles but it is such a powerful human story that no subtitles are needed.  The brutality and violence was conveyed without actually depicting it onscreen.  I visited Monte Sole in Italy a week after viewing this film, which truly enriched my experience.  I would recommend reading ""Silence on Monte Sole"" prior to watching this film, just to set the stage from a historical and character perspective.",1444867200,6,492,4.891566265060241
8665213,5,B00LCT4860,"This is a story full of such sorrow and despair, yet still leaving us with an ever slight hint of, hope for the future. In Giorgio Diritti's ""L'uomo che verr"" (""The Man Who Will Come"" 2009), we get a poignant and realistic recreation of events that took place in Italy (in the region of Bologna), in 1944, between the partisan brigades and the occupying German forces, and the poor villagers caught in the middle. The horrors of war always inflict their worse harm on the innocent (in this case the farmers and villagers and their semi-feudal existence), so it makes perfect sense to have our story unfold from the perspective of an angelic-like child (and wise beyond her years), named 'Martina', who suffered a traumatic experience of her own a few years earlier, and no longer speaks. 'Martina' will become a silent eyewitness to ""man's inhumanity to man"", as she sees both sides commit atrocities for no known reason (she writes a beautiful letter describing how she doesn't understand what the fighting and killing is all about between; the ""foreigners"" and the ""people of the land""), and she obviously represents humanity's ""conscience"", in confronting the ugliest of evils. This film is deeply moving and only the densest of hearts and minds, will not be able to see through the allegory and metaphors depicted in this brave and powerful story. The cast is mostly unknown, except for Maya Sansa ('Lena') as Martina's mother. 'Martina' is brilliantly portrayed by Greta Zuccheri Montanari. The cinematography is rich in its color/contrast composition, and captures the region and time masterfully and somewhat recalled; the Taviani brother's' ""La notte di San Lorenzo"" (""The Night of the Shooting Stars"" 1982). This film is not to be missed, I highly recommend it. The DVD picture and sound quality by Tartan Palisades is excellent. NTSC, Italian (Bolognese), English subtitles, NR 120 mins.

Observation:

With the ongoing ""atrocities of war"" currently being committed against innocent lives in places like: Gaza, Israel, Syria, Iraq, Ukraine, Afghanistan, etc., etc; 'Martina's' story is far from over!!

Love and Peace,
Carlos Romero",1413158400,6,2142,5.149425287356322
