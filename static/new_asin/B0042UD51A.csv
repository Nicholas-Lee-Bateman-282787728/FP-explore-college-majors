It's very difficult to be subjective about a Chopin interpretation; one can dissect it clinically note by note and comment on its accuracy but this can be misleading. Chopin seldom played his pieces the same way twice so any directions on the score can only be suggestive. The beauty of Chopin lies between the notes so a listener hears what he hears which may not be what another person hears. As I say, these are very good interpretations but in my view a bit over sentimental. I prefer the Kristian Zimmerman Performances. To me they are so fresh and spontaneous and I never get tired of listening to them.
Sorry I can't be more definitive.",1302912000,4,724,4.6640625
4252365,5,B0042UD51A,"My first thought was wondering why they didn't use the same pianist for both concerti. But I enjoyed these so much, then I wondered what the results would have been swapping the two combos.

This is a lovely disc. Playing, orchestral contibution and conducting are all beyond reproach. Demidenko is the introspective one with Kissin being the flashier. I really liked the #1. Demidenko is poetic, playful, and treats each note individually. This is a longer concerto than #2 (40min. vs. 24), but it never lags.

Kissin's approach to the #2 (actually written before #1) is more fiery and he exudes much more exhibitionism - good for a concert, perhaps less so over repeated listening. I'll find out, because this is a disc to be played often. The encores are all well done.

The camera work is excellent, not at all intrusive, excellent color balance and saturation ( played on blueray upconverted to 1080p). The sound is likewise about perfect (I used dts, all channels equally balanced)",1291766400,14,987,4.8982035928143715

8413975,5,B0042UD51A,"Kissin was fabulous in his interpretation of the 2nd piano concerto.  Tremendous power and sound!!
Loved he anchors.  Demidenko was excellent in the subtle romantic Chopin.  Great contrast.
Loved it!!",1458604800,,200,5.6

8413977,5,B0042UD51A,"This is a great Blu Ray music disk.  These two pianists give wonderful performances and the pieces, of course, are penetrating and inspiring.  I also want to say that the production is truly worthy of the Blu Ray offering.  The audio is high res surround (or stereo) and the camera work and production great.  Highly recommended.",1437955200,,329,4.821428571428571
8413978,5,B0042UD51A,"It's tough to find good classical Blu-rays that are fairly recently recorded (this one in 2010), crisp picture and sound worthy of HD, and have excellent performances.  If you love Chopin, place this disc in the home theatre and sit back in relax.  As others have stated, the piano concerto #1, one of my favorites, is thoughtful, lyrical, and beautiful.  Concerto #2 has more of the force, talent, and passion of the performer.  He really bring it home.  Of course, Kissin is brilliant and watching him rip into the encores is really fantastic.  Both performances are excellent and this Blu-ray will light up your visual and auditory theater set up.  I just finished it for the first time, and I can guarantee it'll be played often.  You won't be disappointed in either performer.  Excellent!",1409184000,,793,4.858208955223881
8413979,5,B0042UD51A,"Demidenko and Kissin tag team Chopin's #1 and #2 Concerto's respectively.  Shot in Warsaw for Chopin's 200th birthday, this DVD has great video and sound quality.  Demidenko deftly tackles #1 and performs a superb rendition of one of the Mazurkas (the title escapes me for now) for the encore.  Kissin is Kissin.  He drives through #2 and performs two encores, the Revolutionary Etude and the Em Waltz and stands up to take bow as if he were bored with whole thing (he is not, he is just so good that these two demanding technical works are a walk in the park for him).  If you want to have a chuckle just watch the end of Kissins two encores and pay attention to the white haired orchestra member seated behind Kissin.  This guy shakes his head in pure disbelief of Kissins abilities.  Too funny!  If you love Chopin or concerts in general, buy this!",1391472000,,851,4.516339869281046
8413980,4,B0042UD51A,"It is obvious that opinion is divided over this issue. Generally the Kissin contribution is considered outstanding by any standards. This is true - he fairly sizzles throughout the concerto then completely ignites for the encores!

Demidenko, on the other hand, has disappointed many purchasers, largely for not delivering the same type of brilliance. This is an easily understood reaction but I am not sure that it is quite fair to Demidenko (or maybe even Chopin!).

My personal view is that Demidenko is essentially deliberately taking a more introverted and reflective view than is often presented. This is particularly apparent in the first movement which is surprisingly lacking in show but definitely not lacking in musicianship. The second movement is by nature gently lyrical and this suits Demidenko who then produces plenty of light, rhythmical lift and lilt in the third movement whilst still avoiding superficial glitter. I have found it to be perfectly satisfying on its own terms and over repeated viewing. It seems to me to be a viable alternative view - especially if you already have a livelier, more regular approach in your collection (and there are many to choose from).

As mentioned in the opening paragraph, Kissin gives an altogether livelier account of the second concerto and one will which immediately appeal. There is an altogether captivating blend of extrovert virtuosity and sensitivity throughout all three movements and this results in considerable appreciation from the packed audience. Kissin then goes on to give two encores with all the same characteristics. These more outwardly showy and very popular pieces, an etude and a waltz, contrast once again with the quiet and reflective mazurka chosen by Demidenko as his encore.

The recording has clear imaging and sympathetic camera work. The sound is presented in DTS-HD surround and stereo and has great clarity. The Polish orchestra plays this music under the capable direction of Antoni Wit with all the familiarity that one would expect.

So in general summary, in my opinion it is probably best to see this as one obvious winner and one possible alternative view which you may, or may not, share. It seems to me that 4 stars is a fair rating bearing in mind all the above.",1343520000,2,2265,5.077956989247312
8413981,5,B0042UD51A,"Chopins two piano concerto's were composed at roughly the same time. The second was the first to see the light of day. The Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra is conducted by Antoni Wit. Recorded live at the National Philharmonic Hall,Warsaw,2010. The two Pianists are Russians Nikolai Demidenko and Evgeny Kissen, who both have different approaches to playing the instrument. Demidenko is a big man who hunches over the Piano and gently caresses the notes, whereas, Kissen attacks the piano. So you have a contemplative vs the passionate interpretation of Chopins concerto's. Demidenko plays the piano concerto no 1 as if he were making love to the music, and Kissen attacks the piano as if he were a pit bull bringing about  the passion and emotion that Chopin demands in No 2. For encores, Chopins Mazurka in A minor, Etude in C minor, Waltz in E minor. I highly recommend this bluray .",1316908800,2,883,4.886666666666667
8413982,5,B0042UD51A,"For decades and decades, Rubinstein has been the pianist of choice for Chopin, and such was the pre-eminence of the man that it is difficult, even now to disagree . My personal preference though, at least for  the two piano concerti, is for the grand dame of piano Martha Argerich. She has recorded these many times, and the two audio recordings that stand out are the 1996 DG recording of the first concerto with Abbado and the LSO (coupled with Liszt's concerto no 1), and the 1999 recording of both concertos 1 and 2 on EMI with Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony. These are seminal performances, and quite indispensable for any collector of Chopin's music. Then came Krystian Zimerman whose amazing DG recording made us hear the concerti with fresh ears and became for many the first preference for these two works, and justifiably so!
  This celebratory concert for the 200th birthday of Chopin features the Warsaw Philharmonic led by Antoni Wit, and two superstar Russian pianists, Demidenko playing the first concerto in E minor and the even more illustrious Evgeny Kissin playing concert no. 2 in F minor. The Blu ray version is technically superb with excellent picture quality and a spacious true to life DTS audio recording.
  Demidenko's  sensitive, almost poetic rendition of the E minor opus is most satisfying, he seeming to relish every phrase and nuance of this most  beautiful piano concerto. in his hands the first movement,allegro maestoso, impressed me deeply with a haunting tenderness in parts and a restrained passion in the faster passages, whilst the larghetto second evolved, trance-like into a languid and romantic reverie. Fantastic stuff. Antoni Wit  and the orchestra accompany deftly  with some delicious interweaving of the lyrical melody with the solo piano .
  In the second concerto, it is very good to see and hear Kissin approaching his fortieth year, performing a work with which as
a child prodigy, he astounded the musical world with his recording of both concerti on the RCA label in what is now billed as the
legendary Moscow concert in 1984. Do you still remember the astonishment when you heard the wonderful playing and looking at the cover picture of a curly haired, cherubic lad of twelve sitting before a concert grand , gasped , my god , what a stupendous talent ! Well, Kissin is Kissin and plays Chopin's 2nd. with all the bravura and lan it deserves. With seemingly care-free abandon he attacks the fiendishly difficult passages  and carries all before him with his virtuosity, the larghetto, a dreamy paean to love and the allegro with great aplomb. What an ovation the audience gave him.
  Comparisons are sometimes moot. On it's own merits this is a most satisfying concert disc of Chopin's two piano concertos, extremely well recorded and with impeccable performances by two of today's most sought after pianists, this should come high on the list of anybody wanting a modern audio- video recording of these two masterpieces.",1314835200,11,2980,4.969818913480886
8413983,5,B0042UD51A,"When you have two Russian pianists of equally great stature but of very different temperament and the premier Polish orchestra under its distinguished music director assembled for a concert in honor of the composer's 200th birthday, you can expect something very special. This it is indeed. The 2010 concert, recorded in excellent (uncompressed, transparent) audio and video in Warsaw's National Philharmonic Hall, surpasses my high expectations. Nikolai Demidenko's technically perfect, introverted and thoughtful approach to the Piano Concerto No. 1 sheds new light onto the score and will make you re-think the work. Evgeny Kissin, dazzlingly emotional and extraverted, brings off the Second Concerto with incredible bravura. Antoni Wit and his Warsaw Philharmonic musicians treat Chopin's (admittedly not highly accomplished) scores with care, finesse and vigor. Theirs is about the most inspired performance of the orchestral parts I have ever heard. There are brilliant encores from the pianists and endless, well-deserved ovations. This is a DVD to treasure. Get it while you can.",1302998400,5,1087,5.674846625766871
