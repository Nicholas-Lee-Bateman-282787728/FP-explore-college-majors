6075142,5,B00GG2M7K2,"Akiko and Akito have not seen each other in almost 6 years.  Now they are living together in a being renovated school dorm where Akiko declares that she is a brocon and that she wants Akito as her lover.  But her bliss and dream are short lived as others move in and each one has their eyes on him from the childhood friend Gin, to the overly agressive council president who has the nickname ""Predator"", to the 12 year old college graduate who declares she is his finacee.  However this does give him a lot of material as a writer of a brocon series of books - much to the concern of his editor.  With all this attention and pursuit, can Akito even focus on the task at hand and convince his sister to give up being a brocon, or will he succumb to his base desires?

I can see why this could be overlooked in many ways, but I truly enjoyed this show.  It is sub only (which is rare for Funi), but I think they did this because I feel a dubbed version would not be able to have the same punch or entertainment as the original soundtrack.  Each character is enjoyable to watch, is well developed, and has their own personality.  The plot is full of enjoyable misunderstandings, quick puns and jokes, and well paced.  I can see that this could warrant another season, especially at the end when a major plot twist is tossed in, and I can hope for one (like Freezing, Asthetica of a Rogue Hero, and Cat Planet Cuties) but it will be up to the writers to make this dream come true.",1390608000,4,1476,4.242857142857143
6075143,5,B00GG2M7K2,"This series is very funny, if you like ecchi comedies, this one is for you. There really is nothing taboo either, at least no more than the hundred other anime with suspect brocon/siscon happenings. As usual with anime that originally aired on Japanese television, there will be no sex (this isn't hentai), but there is plenty of innuendo, panties and hilariously perverted moments. (this release is uncensored as well, so you may get smacked with a nipple or two but nothing over the top), This is a harem comedy at its best, with a handful of girls who each have their own ""issues"" and a protagonist that realizes whats going on, yet chooses to ignore the facts for the humor it it, not just another, scared, whiny, little kid like you find in many anime of this genre. There is no dub, but who the **** wants that anyway? it would ruin this series like it does with most others. Any guys from teen to adults should if this anime interesting or at least a refreshing alternative to the tons of garbage normally put out by these distributers.",1388448000,5,1043,4.553191489361702
6075144,5,B00GG2M7K2,"Although this was a Subbed-only release, I found myself enjoying it quite a lot. I hope that people can look past the seemingly incestuous atmosphere of this title, because said elements are simply the source where much of the comedy comes from. Nothing sexual is actually done between characters Akito and Akiko. All of the humor and romantic elements find themselves in the interaction between the cast of characters. So for people on the fence because of the implied concept of the show, I hope now that this title is less off-putting to you, as it truly deserves a larger audience, I feel. This show was a lot of fun, and I hope that it gains enough attention to warrant a 2nd season.",1388102400,11,688,4.6016260162601625

6075160,3,B00GG2M7K2,"It's difficult to give this a 3 star rating, I would say that it is a 3.5 if there was such a thing.  I was really close to giving it a 4 star.  This anime is quite funny on many levels but definitely pushes the envelope on what would be considered appropriate to say the least!

A lot of reviews here say that there is no plot.  I disagree! (Spoilers to follow)  Basically, the plot is a brother and sister move into a co-ed dorm house and live with a few other dorm residents.  The sister is a self-admitted ""Brocon"" and unapologetically pursues her doting brother.  He evades much to her chagrin and comedy ensues. This is the major plot point, and most of the comedy revolves around this.  There is also a ""harem"" situation going on in the dorm as the other young ladies are in hot pursuit of the brother.

The brother character (sort of inexplicably?) resists ALL those attempts made by those young ladies who want to be his girlfriend.  I believe he is trying to not only be honorable, but to take care of the people around him.  Understandably he resists the Brocon situation!  However, even his slightly older attractive female editor for his writing job flirts with him.  And although he is single he resists emphatically so that they can have an appropriate work relationship.  A lot of the really funny situations result because of his resistance to hundreds of seduction attempts by the female characters; some are quite innocent while some are strange, bizarre, weird, pushy or in some way over the top.  This guy is just trying to maintain whilst a barrage of seduction is making life very difficult!

The creativity in the different seduction attempts, coupled with the witty dialog and decent animation make this almost a 4 star.  What sort of hurts the comedy is that at points the premise wears thin.  This could have been remedied as in other anime of this type where a background story drives the characters forward; I believe this is why some of the reviews here claimed there is no plot.

I laughed quite a bit watching this anime.  Some of the situations are absurd or unbelievable but that sort of makes them funny. In the end, the final episodes explain much of why the females are so powerfully attracted to the brother character.  The last few episodes were the best.  Many TRUTHS are revealed.... don't want to spoil it as they leave it open to a season 2.  Like a lot of reviews here, I hope that a season 2 is eventually made.

As for some of the technical aspects, there are sub-titles only.  There are no American voice overs.  I didn't feel that this detracted too much if at all.  There are many Japanese cultural and pop culture words and concepts that would be difficult to translate into English.  The voice actors were very good, and I enjoyed their skills very much. As I mentioned in the beginning I was tempted to give this a 4 star review, but part of that was the lack of voice-over.  For some people that is a deal breaker, not so much for me but still.  The animation was very good, but for being a Blueray I wasn't super impressed.  I could have watched it on DVD and probably not known the difference.

Overall, I really enjoyed the series.  It has a very mature content, and can be surprising and even shocking at times.  However it wasn't too much and was there to add to the humor more than to dismay the viewer.",1451865600,17,3362,4.493399339933993

I thought it was English Dub but it wasn't so what is the point of even buying it if it's not even in Dub but what's going on with Funimation they posed to be a dub company it was a waste of $14.35",1433980800,3,299,3.746031746031746
6075176,3,B00GG2M7K2,"I feel as though this anime was lacking. It could've been better. The art-style is nice and looks extremely well on blu-ray and the voice actors are great. The characters are unique in terms of looks and how they were drawn, but their personalities are generic. Now, before I talk about the story's plot I want to mention a little more about the characters themselves.
-The characters
Akito Himenok'ji is the main character of the series. Dark black hair and faded red eyes. He is mature and surprisingly not as indecisive as most harem males tend to be. He cares for his sister and constantly puts up with her shenanigans.
Anastasia Nasuhara. A blonde girl with pigtails. She is calm, yet very perverse.
Ginbee Sawatari is a childhood friend of Akito. She has feelings for Akito, though he is unaware of it.
Arashi Nikaid' is their school's student council president. Wears and eyepatch. She is aggressive and kind of scary at some moments.
Akiko Himenok'ji. The little sister of Akito. She has a cutesy personality and a brother complex.
-The story plot
Now, the anime's plot itself is pretty much non-existent. I laughed once I finished the anime- not because it was funny, but because...well, their was literally no plot. I'm not exaggerating about that either. There really is no plot... at all.
 If you want a little something extra to watch and don't mind a non-progressive story then for 14 dollars this release is a pretty good deal.",1431043200,5,1442,4.791164658634538
6075177,4,B00GG2M7K2,"A fun series, but typical of many other harem comedies, with the added ""spice"" of a sister with an extreme brother complex.

The main reason for writing this review is to point out that the S.A.V.E. release is NOT dubbed; it is a re-issue of the original subtitle-only disks with new packaging. If you have the ""first release"" of OniAi, this does not give you anything you don't already have.

Funimation points out that OniAI was a first for them. If subtitle-only series sell well, they said they will consider bringing a wider selection of series that do not justify the expense of a full dub effort. You can find more information about this by searching the Funimation site for news on OniAi.",1428451200,54,696,4.650406504065041

6075179,5,B00GG2M7K2,"I love this anime. Some of the characters are absolutely adorable. though some people may not like the story, I found it really enjoyable.",1403136000,,138,4.791666666666667
6075180,3,B00GG2M7K2,"Oniai is a fun enough series, although the first two or three episodes were sort of tedious, but absolutely don't expect any story. When I say 'any', I don't mean 'a deep story' like reviewers often do; I mean any kind of sensible narrative at all. The show jumps around like a free association quiz, occasionally coming to rest on a plot thread for a minute (as with the flashbacks to Ginbei's past late in the series), then quickly abandoning it. Nothing happens in the entire show, aside from harem antics. It makes To-Love-Ru (which I like) look like Bakemonogatari.

On the other hand, I kind of appreciate that; instead of making us sit through tedious, half-baked drama like some harem shows, Oniai just acknowledges what it is. Some of the jokes were kind of clever, and I have to give it credit for using character-based humor, and mostly staying away from the 'random giant robots and sword fights' sort of thing that Love Hina did a lot of. I also appreciate (as I did in To-Love-Ru) that the girls have relationships among themselves and think of each other as something other than ""that hussy who's always trying to steal my guy"".

Oniai is nothing special, but you could do worse for a harem show.",1402012800,4,1211,4.627906976744186
6075181,1,B00GG2M7K2,"This series contains some nudity/fan service and is not suitable for children under 18.

I bought this series based off a few positive 5 star reviews... huge mistake.  The characters are bland and boring.  There is no effort to expand the story line or setting that they live in.  Everyone goes to school, allegedly, and that's about all you find out about their lives.  The series fails to make you care about the characters and there is no character development or change.

The major plot line is the younger sister loves (wants to marry) her older brother.  While this seems like it has the potential for humor, it doesn't pull it off.  You are hit over the head with this same repetitive theme each and every episode.  For diversity, the show decides to introduce a 12 year old who considers herself engaged to the main character.  Instead of adding humor, it is a poor and disturbing excuse to have a 12 year old run around w/o clothes on.  The ""student president"" is also a borderline sexual predator.  Instead of producing cheap laughs and amusingly awkward moments, it comes off as creepy.

The animation was OK, nothing special.  The range of locations, situations, and outfits was limited as well.  The girls were kind of cute, but lacked that extra something that draws the viewer in.  There was no English dub but the Japanese voice acting was good.  If you're interested in the fan service, don't bother subjecting yourself to watching the entire mind numbing series, just skip to the special features on disc 2.",1402012800,,1525,4.737642585551331

Oniai, though sounding off-putting because of the incestuous overtones, is better and funnier than I ever expected. The drastic personality difference of each girl plays seemingly off the others, ending in best and most over-the-top reactions and situations. Though it was only a sub release, the original voice acting is great, fitting each perfectly. I hope that there is a second season.",1392940800,5,493,5.098765432098766
6075183,4,B00GG2M7K2,"In terms of the anime, I give it a solid 4 out of 5 stars due to fact that Oniai is a sort of parody on ecchi animes. I personally loved the facial expressions of the characters, their reactions to sudden events, and the fact that background characters appear to have nothing better to do than watch what's happening with the main characters.

As of this post though, I would recommend not purchasing the anime until it has dropped to below fifty dollars. The anime is only twelve episodes long, contains some special features, and comes in both DVD and Blu-ray. From my own research with anime pricing, this should land the price between thirty dollars to forty dollars. Any more than that means that you should hold off on purchasing the anime until the price has fallen.",1391990400,,773,4.601449275362318
6075184,5,B00GG2M7K2,"OniAi... where to start... When I first watched this series in December of 2011 I was unsure. At first I didn't know what to expect when I read the synopsis about a girl having the hots for her brother, thoughts of Kiss x Sis popped up in my mind but I decided to give it a try anyway.

It was hilarious
It was entertaining
It was happy

you name it, the title is somewhat misleading... now flash forward to 2014

I had forgotten about this show, it wasn't until I saw funimation's ad that I vaguely remembered the plot and the twists and turns held within it. I clicked buy without even reading it because I got so used to assuming that anything funimation released would be dubbed. Well after pressing buy and waiting a day I began to read posts about it being a sub only show. I looked into it and was disappointed, I was genuinely looking forward to hearing an english adaptation of this show, I decided that even though I was disappointed I would hold my preorder and see if this product would be done any better than my other sub only show, Mayo Chiki.

So I opened the box and first I was surprised at how much effort went into this combo pack, the case comes with two images one in underwear and the other side in the normal clothes, then you have the standard assortment of extras, and of course your dvd's and blu rays. All of this for a very affordable price of 30 dollars, now I approached this show very cautiously, I hadn't watched it in over 2 years and it was essentially the same product I streamed.

That first episode had me laughing all over again. While I would have liked to have been able to just listen to it I actually didn't mind watching it in japanese, as a matter of fact at first I was glancing over to it but by the end of the first episode I was full on watching the show. I wasn't on the computer no, I was planted in front of my tv reading every word and laughing. That is amazing, I was very happy with their decision to at least release the show, the blu ray quality is great and so are the subs; clean, white high res subs that don't make your eyes hurt.

Do I think this show deserves a dub, at this point I don't know, the shows quick pace and jokes may be a difficult undertaking to do correctly but I would be lying if I said I didn't want to hear an alternative take on the show but the japanese audio is amazing, this is truly a show that I would watch again and again.",1391731200,4,2412,4.154175588865097

8622736,3,B00GG2M7K2,"I just finished bing watching this series about 2 hours ago all the while trying to figure out which girl to root for (Anastasia for the most part). This is a typical comedy/harem-style anime where a brother and sister reunite after 6 yrs of being apart and the sister (Akiko) is a hardcore bro-con ready to take their relationship to the next level. Her brother (Akito) is made aware of this early in the first episode and is not interested, but Akiko  is not one to be easily deterred. The sibling live in a campus dorm and are soon flooded with three beauties all trying to make a move on Akito. I bought this series  reading these review thinking this would just be a funny anime with not real story I found myself laughing in the early episodes to be sure but found that there was something else going on with Akito. In the beginning of the final episode it seemed Anastasia would take the stage as the chosen girl as she we learn her feeling for Akito are genuine and rub deeper than originally thought. In the episodes  final moments we learn that Akiko and Akito are NOT blood-related siblings (a fact Akito knows and refuse to tell Akiko), because as much of a bro-con as she is the idea of them being blood-related is the only thing keeping her breaks on and if she knew the truth she wouldnt hold back and Akito wouldnt be able to keep his on.
