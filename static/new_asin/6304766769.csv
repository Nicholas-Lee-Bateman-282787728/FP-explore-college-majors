7878335,4,6304766769,"The movie really got me going. It had action, suspense and drama all mixed into the same movie. The cast was explosive and had great chemistry together.

Leonard Maltin's Review said: ""Good cast in an irredeemably awful film that didn't make it to theatres in the US. A daring museum heist goes bad, leaving the volatile partners to drive to Miami to make their dropoff--if they can avoid killing each other along the way. A more despicable bunch of characters would be hard to imagine."" Maltin gave the film a Bomb (One Star Out Of Four) but that is too low. While there are better films in this genre I can't say that I did not like this film. Yet I admit that the failure of the group to work together and the idiocy of Chino doomed them from the beginning. These fellows should have taken a cue from characters seen in The Score or Heist or Entrapment. Those were true professionals. Never has the quote ""There is no honor among thieves"" been more appropriate! Read Leonard Maltin's 1999 or 2000 Movie Review to get the gist of this movie.

Unfortunately haters like Gary (See His One Star Review Then Forget You Read It) seem to mix up fantasy with reality. The movie did not advocate the death of police officers, it was just an unintended consequence of the thieves going from point A to point B. See the similar movie One False Move for a comparison. The scene was necessary for the plotline to continue. Never mind that the ""crew"" started killing each other as well, so there were no ""winners"" in the end.

Like Adam Shoemaker, I highly reccomend this flick. I too wish it would be released onto American Regional DVD. My suspicion is that cop lovers like Gary and the conservative suits fear a backlash from places (Deep South & Southwest) that can't seperate imagination from reality. What a shame to see censorship suppressing creativity.

7878336,5,6304766769,"One word.  Three letters.
WOW!
This movie has it all.  A great cast, an explosive story, and wonderful plot.
John Leguizamo is absolutely amazing.  And David Caruso has never been better.
Now if it were only available on DVD.",1046649600,6,225,4.717948717948718
7878337,1,6304766769,"Take a look at that web site dedicated to law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty to experience the true 'body count' behind this dispicable picture. The film makers want you to sleep easy knowing that the families of these murderers got their 'cut'. If you want to find out just how low American cinema can go then grab a shovel and dig up this video. Take a friend though, you'll need to work in shifts.",1023840000,2,417,4.358974358974359
7878338,4,6304766769,"Body Count, David Caruso's last film, is a surprisingly entertaining, violent thriller, about a bank assault that goes very wrong, throwing the members of the crew into a rollercoaster ride. Although this story has been  told million of times by Hollywood, like in Burt Reynolds' upcoming Pups,  Body Count has some particular qualities that make it original, hot and  intense. The cast is great, actors like Ving Rhames, Joe Leguizamo and even  Donnie Wahlberg deliver their jobs with mastery and talent. Rhames, who was  excellent in Don King, is charming and brilliant as the most controlled  member of the crew, and even in a small part, his presence is powerful.  Leguizamo has in the film the chance to prove that he is in fact an actor  with great dramatic potential, is too bad to see him in bad comedies,  wasting his capacity. Caruso is a regular actor, he  is still waiting for  his breakthrough role, and in this movie he can show that he is excellent  when he has something good in his hands. Body Count is a violent and  terrific movie, if you want to buy it, do it, this film follows the same  tradition of memorable cop-dramas, such as Sharky's Machine, The French  Connection and many others!",944179200,5,1209,4.717703349282297
7878339,4,6304766769,"Have you ever seen a cast that fit there roles better than this... David Caruso plays one-hell-of -a tough guy, (and is truely convincing) Ving Rhames as the crim with a heart of... Bronze, John Leguizamo as a homicidal  maniac who could kiss you one second and blow your head off the next, Linda  Fiorentino as the not so trustworthy hitchhiker, Forest Whitaker as the man  with the plan and Donnie Whalberg as the token Weakling. Don't expect lots  of action, but do expect great acting and some nice, honest crime noir  twists. Then you won't be disapointed.",944092800,4,561,4.683673469387755
