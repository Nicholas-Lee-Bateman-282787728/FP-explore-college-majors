7167589,1,B00XF9K09Y,Until it decided to not work about an hour into the movie. I've tried several times to get it to get past that point to no avail. Should've watched it sooner so that I could have returned it. Now I'm stuck with a movie that won't finish. What a waste of time and especially money.,1461801600,,280,4.109090909090909
7167590,5,B00XF9K09Y,"Just as good as the first Sin City... I love a movie with a good story and unusual presentation... I call it one of my ""artsy-fartsy"" movies... I watch every now and then along with the 1st one...",1456790400,3,196,4.184210526315789

8715837,4,B00XF9K09Y,A bit on the crazy side.  Didn't expect it to have so much in black and white.  Really is an off-the-wall movie and does take a bit of watching to get the gist of the story.,1478822400,,173,3.7777777777777777
8715838,5,B00XF9K09Y,How can you NOT love Eva Green in this!,1474329600,,39,3.4444444444444446
8715839,5,B00XF9K09Y,Everything about this movie met my expectations. I own the 1st Sin City and this prequel is absolutely amazing. I don't have the time to express my love for this picture. The best way to say is: Frank Miller's fans: buy both movies - they are so worthy!,1465516800,3,253,4.291666666666667
