8684562,4,B00OQRU9YU,"The adventure in the Unova region and beyond continues with this DVD box set. Containing the remaining episodes of the Black and White series, this set covers the journey of Ash, Iris, Cilan and Pikachu as they make their way across the Decolore Islands. Along the way, they will cross paths with the gym leader Clair and the journalist Alexa as the gap is bridged between the BW and XY series of Pokmon. The sound and picture quality are clean and crisp, and it's another great addition to any DVD collection for a fan of Pokmon or those with children and families.",1478649600,,566,4.5588235294117645
