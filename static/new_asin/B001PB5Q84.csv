3746791,5,B001PB5Q84,"Christopher Ruddy states it more eloquently and in more detail than I could:
The Pope who led the Catholic Church during Hitler's reign over most of Europe was either a disgrace or one of the great heroes of modern times. The evidence proves the latter.

Soon after World War II, Pope Pius XII, Eugenio Pacelli, was lauded as a man who not only was able to keep the church intact despite the Nazis but also had even protected Jews during the Holocaust.

In recent years, however, detractors have claimed that the Pope turned a blind eye to the Nazi atrocities against the Jews.

A newly released DVD casts fresh light on the role Pius XII played during the Holocaust and dispels these widely held, mistaken views.

""A Hand of Peace: Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust,"" produced by Ignatius Press, commemorates the 70th anniversary of Pius XII's elevation to the papacy. He also is being considered for sainthood.

Since the source of the film is a Catholic distributor, cynics may be quick to dismiss it as biased, but the documentary provides evidence to the contrary -- several prominent Jews give witness to Pius XII's efforts to save Jews. Notable among them is Martin Gilbert, the eminent British historian and authorized biographer of Winston Churchill.

Gilbert is an ardent Zionist and author of the book ""Holocaust,"" yet he praises the late Pope.

The DVD stresses that, after World War II, Jewish organizations around the world recognized Pius XII for saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of Jews and other Nazi targets.

Then in 1963, the controversial play ""The Deputy"" opened in Berlin. The work -- by a German playwright, no less -- laid the blame of the Holocaust on the Pope. The playwright, Rolf Hochhuth, claimed that the Pope's alleged indifference to the suffering of Jews during the Holocaust allowed it to happen. The pontiff was cold-hearted, uncaring, and evil, Hochhuth suggested.

The play was translated into more than 20 languages, and it sparked outrage -- even riots -- in several cities where it was performed.

""The Deputy"" presented ""scurrilous tales with no historical basis,"" according to Ron Rychlak, author of ""Hitler, the War and the Pope."" Nevertheless, the play, along with several other works, including John Cornwell's 1999 book ""Hitler's Pope,"" created what came to be known as a ""black legend"": that Pius XII was unconcerned about Nazi atrocities.

But these allegations are simply nonsense. Gilbert said the Pope ""went to the edge of risk again and again"" to help the Jews.

Before becoming Pope, Eugenio Pacelli was the Vatican's secretary of state. He was elected to the papacy on March 12, 1939. Germany invaded Poland in that September, and one month later, Pius XII issued his first encyclical, which was sharply critical of the invasion and of the Nazi philosophy regarding race.

He had good reason to worry about the Nazis. Soon after they invaded Poland, the Nazis rounded up 5,000 Polish priests and systematically murdered them. The episode is detailed in William Shirer's ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany.""

Following the Pope's Christmas 1941 address, The New York Times stated in an editorial: ""The voice of Pius XII is a lonely voice in the silence and darkness enveloping Europe this Christmas. He is about the only ruler left on the continent of Europe who dares to raise his voice at all.""

Considering the fact that the Vatican was surrounded by Axis powers, first Mussolini's regime and then Hitler's, the Pope had little room to maneuver, at least publicly.

Privately, he took great risks. For example, churches were ordered to hand out baptismal certificates and passports to thousands of refugees -- Jews, Gypsies, and others -- sparing them from the concentration camps.

Pius XII even spent much of his private inheritance to pay for the refugees' travel.

When the Nazis began the deportation of Rome's Jews, he ordered convents, monasteries, and other Catholic facilities to hide Jews, and even turned the papal bedroom into a birthing area for Jewish mothers.

Some of these revelations are not surprising to me.

A few years ago, I heard firsthand from the late Vernon Walters, who had served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and deputy director of the CIA. In World War II, young Walters was assigned to the staff of Gen. Mark Clark, the Allied general who led U.S. forces into Rome in 1944.

As Walters told me, Clark sent him to the Vatican to offer Allied assistance to the Pope.

Walters recalled being in his jeep and pulling up in front of the locked gates of the Vatican. More than a dozen priests dressed in cassocks greeted him.

Speaking Italian, Walters said to the monsignor in charge, ""General Clark has told me to inform you the city of Rome has been liberated. He asks if the Holy See has any pressing needs.""

Without batting an eye, the monsignor replied: ""We in the Vatican are fine. But we are hiding 50,000 Jews in and around the city of Rome. They are in urgent need of food and medical care. The Holy Father asks for your assistance with these people.""

As a result of the Pope's actions, Rome saved a higher percentage of its Jews than any other occupied city.

After Germany surrendered in 1945, the World Jewish Congress even gave a financial gift to the Vatican in recognition of the Pope's wartime works, and Jewish leaders around the world hailed him.

When Pius XII died in October 1958, The Jewish Post observed, ""There probably was not a single ruler of our generation who did more to help the Jews in their hour of greatest tragedy, during the Nazi occupation of Europe, than the late Pope.""

The ""black legend"" called that view into question. I am glad ""A Hand of Peace"" finally sets the record straight.",1255132800,57,5760,4.826219512195122

I did not know much about this pope so I thank those that took the time to educate us by filminig this documentary.  It is wonderful to see all he did for not only catholics, but Jewish.  Back in the days the church could not talk against the nazis so this pope helped thousands of jewish people to hide in the catholic church, monasteries, etc so they would not get killed.  He also used money from hs heritance to send 3000 jews to Brazil as he got them passports. He started converting the jews to catholics so they could fleat the country and not be prosecuted.  He was great!  He was smart the way he helped all these thousands of jews from not getting killed. I think that a hollywood director should take the time to make it into a movie just like they got to do "" A Man that became Pope"", becasue Pope Pius XII was also great, and many need to hear it.  This documentary is not boring.  Time goes by very quick leaving you with wanting more.  It is not just for catholics, christians or Jewish, but anyone should watch it to learn the history of the nazis not only prosecuting jewish, but catholics too. Here they do not talk so much about how nazis prosecuted the catholics, but they mention it.  I have seen other movies that show killing of priests, nuns when Hitler was in control.  Many think that the nazis killed only jewish, but no they are wrong as they also killed thousands of catholics. The nazis wanted to aniquilate religion so they could keep control of everyone.  Religion was a threat to the Comunist party, because when you believe in GOD we are just focused on our Heavenly Father. Dictators want of us to just focus on them as GOD, and just listen to them, but they see that our lives are focused on GOD and no one will ever be able to destroy that, because GOD won't allow it to happen. Evil devours itself. I have an atheist friend that really liked the documentary.  He was interested in the history that was in it of nazis and the prosecution. He has seen few catholic movies with me and admires the way Catholics help everyone. He really enjoyed it.  That is why I say  it is for everyone.",1358294400,6,2218,4.336561743341404

3746799,2,B001PB5Q84,"Mechione is a well-intentioned woman whose thesis is that Pope Pius valiantly tried to prevent the holocaust. Relying upon items in Vatican files and the efforts of some church members to stem suffering, she argues Pius was misunderstood. Some Catholics saved Jews at tremendous risk to themselves and thousands of Italian Jews were spared due to the activity of the Vatican. Nonetheless, the well-intentioned author fails to address some tough points and glosses over others. Here are a few:

1. The Vatican executed an important concordance with Nazi Germany and later with fascist Italy. Religious Catholics could believe that participation in the Nazi regime did not offend Catholic traditions. Indeed the 1933 concordat between the Catholic Church and the new Nazi regime said essentially that. Would the Jews have suffered less if instead of signing an agreement with the Nazi ruling, Pius had spoken out against the excesses of Nazism. Few of the relatives of those that had died in the concentration camps, beaten on Krittalnacht, would agree with the concordat.

2. Clearly many Catholics were Nazis and the Holocaust could not have occurred without the active support of Catholic Nazis.

One can validly say the Catholic Church should not be singled out. Germans Lutherans and Eastern Orthodox likewise played an active role in identifying Jews, arresting them, torturing and starving, and then killing them, whether they were steroetypic 60 year old men with beards or 7 year old boys and girls crying to be saved at Auschwitz.

3. She notes a few sympathetic statements- ""This Christmas, more than ever, the Pope is a lonely voice crying out in the silence of a continent."" --New York Times editorial, Dec. 25, 1942. Yet even here they are misplaced. Generally the statements did not mention Jews as the victims or more importantly, Catholics, as the perpetrators. This was an immensely powerful man. Had he told the faithful not to persecute (or at least not torture, starve, or kill) the Jews, surely many, if not most would listen. The statements were never directed towards Catholics and maintained the fiction that people other than his faithful were committing these horrible acts.  Pius failed to excommunicate or even condemn Nazis.  The DVD and prior book failed to note Pius's enormous power and authority over his Catholic followers, many of whom would serve in the Nazi regime.

4. Christian Views on Treatment of Jews During Nazi Germany

Pius's legacy is one of failure,  To the extent he sought to provide limited help to the Jews, we can say that the great theologian Luther was far more successful in communicating and having his vision adopted. Most Germans could and did believe that anti-semitism was consistent with Christian religious tradition.  Martin Luther's poignant words of knowledge and insight were obviously followed by Germans:

""Therefore be on your guard against the Jews, knowing that wherever they have their synagogues, nothing is found but a den of devils in which sheer selfglory, conceit, lies, blasphemy, and defaming of God and men are practiced most maliciously and veheming his eyes on them.

Moreover, they are nothing but thieves and robbers who daily eat no morsel and wear no thread of clothing which they have not stolen and pilfered from us by means of their accursed usury. Thus they live from day to day, together with wife and child, by theft and robbery, as archthieves and robbers, in the most impenitent security. Over and above that we let them get rich on our sweat and blood, while we remain poor and they such the marrow from our bones.

Having set forth his views, Luther the great theologian proposed a solution,

""What shall we Christians do with this rejected and condemned people, the Jews?  First to set fire to their synagogues or schools and to bury and cover with dirt whatever will not burn, so that no man will ever again see a stone or cinder of them. This is to be done in honor of our Lord and of Christendom, so that God might see that we are Christians, and do not condone or knowingly tolerate such public lying, cursing, and blaspheming of his Son and of his Christians. For whatever we tolerated in the past unknowingly  and I myself was unaware of it  will be pardoned by God. But if we, now that we are informed, were to protect and shield such a house for the Jews, existing right before our very nose, in which they lie about, blaspheme, curse, vilify, and defame Christ and us (as was heard above), it would be the same as if we were doing all this and even worse ourselves, as we very well know.

Second, I advise that their houses also be razed and destroyed. For they pursue in them the same aims as in their synagogues. Instead they might be lodged under a roof or in a barn, like the gypsies. This will bring home to them that they are not masters in our country, as they boast, but that they are living in exile and in captivity, as they incessantly wail and lament about us before God.""  From the Jews and their Lies

This tract was adopted in large part by the Nazis based upon Christian thought.  To the extent it was wrong, it was incumbent of Pius to clearly and forecfully say do.  Pope Pius did not.  Luther's thoughts with the addition of murder formed the basis for much Christian theology during Nazi Germany.  In this way, Germans could be both Christians and Nazis attending church, and also arrange for torture, starvation, and murder, without there being any seeming contradiction.

5. The Bible and New Testament cannot be anti-semitic; it is a story about a Jew, Jesus and his vision for the world based upon love, compassion, forgiveness, and the Golden Rule.  Nonetheless, to the unschooled and followers of Luther, similarities between Nazi teachings could be seen.

A. The New Testament at times portrays Jews as a money-obsessed sect (remember Jesus ejecting the money-lenders) with one, Judas, betraying Jesus for gold. Nazi doctrine taught the Jews were equally obsessed with money and had betrayed Germany.
Clarifying that Church doctrine could not support or permit the horrible acts that were being perpetrated was a point Pope Pius should have made. Instead the various concordats between the church and the Nazi regime allowed German Catholics to believe that their religion need not conflict with their patriotism.

The biblical statement by Jewish temple leaders that his blood will be upon us provided some misguided Germans with the religious justification for continued Jewish suffering and death; a clarificaiton could have helped.

6. The torture and murder of Converted Christians

Indeed, many of the Jews who were killed were not really Jews at all. Many had converted to Catholicism or other Christian religions. They may have gone to Church on Sunday, accepted communion, followed Catholic law, but when Hitler came to power, they were still Jews. Clarifying that converted Catholics were Catholics would have placed a barrer in front of Hilter's racial classifications.

Pius had the opportunity to clarify this, to explain that Joseph and Mary were Jewish, to discuss the Jewish roots of the church, to explain that anti-semitism is condemning a part of one's own religion, and to speak out clearly and forcefully. Indeed, many of the Jews who would die were Catholic or Christian having converted. They may have taken communion, had their children baptized, helped with church functions, but when things got tough, for the Nazi party and the average German, they were dirty stinking Jews.

7. Moral Failure Did Pius convince the many Germans of his message.  Of course not.  German and Polish Catholics killed large numbers of Jewish women and children.  Later other nationalities would die and Germans themselves.  In 1945, as the war was undisputably loss, Nazi leaders said, take 10 and 11 year old children were no training and put them in combat so they can die.  As German Christians, we have been taught to have no respect for life, no morality, to be evil, and this can complete our passage.

8. Temples were looted and burned in Crytallnacht. One priest stood by the temple and said stop do not do this. But 1, only
1. Others stood silent as Jews were terrorized and their places of worship burned. Had Pius vigorously intervened here, the holocaust could have been prevented, at least Catholic participation limited.

One million Jews could not have been located in Poland without the active support and participation of Polish Catholics.

Again clarification is fair. Eastern Orthodox congregants and those of other Christian faiths seemed equally happy to provide names of Jewish men, women, and children to the Nazis so that they could be imprisoned and killed. There were the courageioius fews, but too little.

9. Catholics arrested and killed Jews, at the same time they attended communion, and refrained from divorce and abortion. They followed, or at least believe they were following church teachings as in 1940, one could be both a Nazi murderer and a Catholic or Lutheran.  Herr Schmidt arranged to murder 5,000 Jewish women and children, but why should he be excommunicated what has he done wrong.

10. Did a few Israeli officials say some nice words about Pius. Sure. The new state had been attacked by four separate countries. Aside from the US there were few places for Jews to go. They had been murdered in Germany, France, Poland, Ukraine, and elsewhere. This was a time no offend people.

We can recognize recently deceased John Paul as a great man who helped bring people together. We do not seek to level current church members with the sins of the past. However, if the purpose of the book is to set down an accurate record, it fails. Many Catholics seek a defense of Pope Pius just like Capernicus's foes sought to show the planets revolved around the earth.

The best that can be said is that this was a modest man whose true beliefs remained unclear. He or at least his staff did provide tremendous help to Italian Jews. As to the many others, too little was said, and too much was agreed. We can only speculate of what would have occurred had he told his faithful not to assist the Nazis or participate in acts against the Jews.

The task of discussing what should have been done is important because we all face moral quandries. Broad Catholic bashing is misplaced; for Catholic charities probably have done as much to prevent hunger and combat starvation in the last 30 years as any religion. Pope John Paul brought people together before his untimely death. Ultimately confronted with some tough choices, Pope Pius failed and many died. A more complete and balanced discussion could have made this a better DVD, though combining this with books like Hitler's Pope can provide a somewhat balanced view.",1273881600,13,10785,4.897858319604613

Did you know that your review is supposed to be about the movie, not the other reviewers - no matter WHOM they are..)
I am grateful to all those involved in producing this excellent documentary after the long proliferation of the black legend of Pope Pius XII's supposed silence during World War II. I have researched Pius XII and found reams of evidence concerning his heroism and the world wide acclamation for this gentle man of peace. Pius XII spent his life and his papacy fighting against ideologies he recognized as harmful and destructive - Nazism and communism. Only after the release of the play ""The Deputy"" did the smear against Pius begin in earnest, then was picked up by other authors, until today many blindly believe the lies about Pope Pius XII without ever looking into the facts.
In January 2007, the National Review Online carried a story by Ian Pacepa, a former senior Soviet spy who defected to the US in 1979. Pacepa states that the KGB recognized the threat the Catholic Church represented to its control over the Eastern Bloc countries, and mounted a campaign to undermine its moral authority. Since Pius XII died in 1958, he could no longer defend himself, and the KGB choose to target him. ""The Deputy"" was written by the KGB and Rolf Hochhuth was a communist. This was reported again in the National Catholic Register on page 2 of the May 24, 2009 edition. Not surprisingly, in a world that like nothing better than to see the largest Christian Church on earth defamed, this was not reported by any secular news agencies - unless I missed it.
Margherita Marchione has done an amazing job of documenting the truth about Pius XII. I highly recommend her books and this wonderful documentary, in which she appears. I also urge you to do your own research, honestly investigate the basis behind the conflicting claims about Pope Pius XII and reach your own conclusions. This movie is an excellent place to start.",1262390400,28,2112,4.7574931880108995

Provided more material on this would better explain all of the words of appreciation by Jews for Pius XII after the war was over, to which the documentary provides considerable attention.

2.)  I saw this same documentary several years ago and remembered other material that was good but seems to have been edited out of the current version.

3.) There is a nearly ten minute verbose and undramatic redaction at the end, of a priest giving a synopsis of the documentary plus other information on Pius XII.
