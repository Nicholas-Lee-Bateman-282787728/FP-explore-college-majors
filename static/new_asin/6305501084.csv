7890936,3,6305501084,some scence were funny not what i was expecting you can tell this is a very low budget shot film cause i don't know any of the actors in the movie overall i will give it 3 half stars,1395792000,,182,3.6923076923076925
7890937,3,6305501084,"Obviously, low budget projects usually lack the polish a blockbuster film has. Forget any special effects. But, what this film lacks in ""quality"", it makes up in simple, silly, fun, laughs.

Rod Z plays a lovable character you can't help but fall in love with,

Pretty much all the  characters are played ""from the gut"" and are just an ensemble of fun, funny, and lovables you'll enjoy. And se of the eye candy is pretty nice too!",1373241600,,430,4.558441558441558

Essentially, this is the crude ""story"" of a college football player who goes down to Daytona with his friends for Black Spring break and hopes to sing with the pros. Problem is: outrageously bad acting, corny ""humor,"" strong and unecessary reverse racism (the lone geeky White character is constantly referred to as a ""cracker,"") vile sexism, unappealing characters. etc. etc.
Get this video only if your fireplace runs low this winter.",1030752000,2,505,5.023809523809524
7890939,1,6305501084,"I must admit, it was terrible.  I hate to admit i liked it.  I guess it was so STUPID, you couldn't help it.",1009497600,,108,3.652173913043478
7890940,3,6305501084,"I found it to be a cool movie.  The budget was totally micro and some of the comedy was a bit too over the top... downright silly, and the story got a bit predictable.  Nonetheless, I found myself liking it a bit.",952819200,7,213,4.0476190476190474
