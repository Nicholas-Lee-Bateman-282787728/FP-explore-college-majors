8556592,5,B00AQQGW96,This is great DVD it covers everything with regards to the proportion of the body. The only criticism I have against it is that it covers the male body in detail but there is hardly anything on the female body. Charles Hu is a fantastic lecturer and gives clear and concise explanations about what he is drawing.,1385251200,,312,4.491228070175438
8556593,5,B00AQQGW96,"I have tried a number of instructional DVDs on drawing the figure and have been disappointed by the lack of structure, poor delivery of information, and lack of information in the videos. This video, however, is structured and provides a wealth of knowledge about the proportions of the figure and landmarks on the body and head in a small period of time. Charles Hu is an excellent instructor, and, unlike most art instructors, he is able to focus on his lecture while drawing instead of pausing and getting side-tracked from trying to do two tasks at the same time. The amount my drawing has improved from watching this video far exceeds the improvement I received from hours of watching other videos. I look forward to trying the other four DVDs in this series.",1370736000,2,764,4.7518796992481205
