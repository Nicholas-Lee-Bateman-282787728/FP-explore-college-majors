8192224,5,B000PKG7LG,"I have always been fascinated with Morocco and have lived there now for nearly eight years. Bowles provides us in his writing and in this documentary of his life an insight into what Morocco was like in days gone by. It must have been a fascinating place! I realize that the country has made tremendous steps forward over the past 42 years since I first set foot in Morocco, but you have to wonder if something has not been lost over the years. As countries become more modern there is a certain quality and uniqueness captured in Bowles' writings and experiences that seems to go by the wayside. I'm sure it's all progress and I doubt many Moroccans would want to go back to the past of their grandparents, but I thoroughly enjoy reading those experiences of people who lived in Morocco in days gone by and who chronicled their lives and thoughts for everyone to share in and learn from.",1307836800,,888,4.521739130434782

8192226,5,B000PKG7LG,"I don't think any writer has ever been served as well by a documentary as Paul Bowles is in this excellent film. There are stimulating interviews with Bowles and his critics and friends, and the differces and contradictions in their views are thoroughly explored. Allen Ginsberg gives a remarkable, lucid explication of Bowles' world-view, and others give honest glimpses into his fascinating life. The filmakers pull off the impossible trick of being severely objective and sympathetic at the same time; their approach is the journalistic equal of Bowles prose style. Includes excerpts from Bowles' lively musical compositions. Bowles was a terrifying, implacable writer but he had something important so say, and fans of ""The Sheltering Sky"", ""A Distant Episode"" and his other work should not miss this.",991785600,13,805,5.346456692913386
