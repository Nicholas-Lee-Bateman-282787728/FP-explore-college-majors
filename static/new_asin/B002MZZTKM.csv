8374412,5,B002MZZTKM,"Well paced, early super-spy, high-tech (for the 1930s!) thriller. Don't think the genre started with 007 in the 1960s! Secret cabal of criminal arms traders and financiers out to profit by starting a world-war with a ""false-flag"" bomb attack - opposed by a handful of covert agents who risk death at every turn!",1419897600,,311,4.886792452830188
8374413,5,B002MZZTKM,A good peek into what the public was worried about before World War II.  A nice thriller. Sinister Cinema continues to provide rare material at a fair price.,1368230400,,157,4.607142857142857
