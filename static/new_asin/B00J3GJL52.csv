6330207,5,B00J3GJL52,a very good short documentary. I've seen it a couple times and i was also a kickstarter backer.,1410652800,,95,4.333333333333333
6330208,5,B00J3GJL52,Found it very interesting and it was well made. If you love Sriracha then I would recommend this movie. You will be impressed by the story of how Sriracha was made.,1410307200,,164,4.32258064516129
6330209,3,B00J3GJL52,This felt more like a commercial than a documentary.,1408838400,,52,4.888888888888889

6330211,5,B00J3GJL52,"This documentary would have been good rather it was about Sriracha, or trees. It's plainly how Griffin displays his interest in whatever he is documenting, and I hope Griffin continues to make more films and documentaries. Some of the shots in this documentary were cinema like, just outstanding and beautiful.",1401580800,4,310,5.22
6330212,5,B00J3GJL52,"I am sure that most folks are familiar by the odd shape hot sauce that you find at almost any restaurant named Sriracha.  It has become a favorite for the foodie set and some folks swear by it.
Griffin Hammond in his documentary, Sriracha has created in a 30 minute film, a concise history and the story behind the story.  Founded by Chinese native David Tran after he fled Vietnam, Sriracha was a product created as a taste of home on the Vietnamese dish Pho.
A mix of peppers, water, bit of garlic, and lots of love, Sriracha has had a steady growth and has been found as far as on the Space Station and used all over the world.  An American product, Sriracha is a truly entrepreneur success story.
Check out this spicy tale of an iconic hot sauce in a witty and fun style that celebrates the wonder of Sriracha.  I saw this film as part of the Atlanta Film Festival.  I highly recommend and will have you craving some Sriracha!",1397001600,17,930,4.3526011560693645
6330213,4,B00J3GJL52,"What a great story this is! David Tran, unwelcome in the country where he was born, comes to the USA...a nation whose huge majority of people are descended from very recent immigrants...with nothing, creates something tasty and new, and by dint of hard work and canny sales technique, creates an entire market for his product.

Take that, anti-immigrant bigots. Bet most of you have a bottle of sriracha in your house.",1488672000,,418,4.887323943661972

6330275,5,B00J3GJL52,"From Sriracha's recent American popular uprising in California, to its actual birthplace in Thailand, even visiting the city of Si Racha, this 33 minute documentary is fun filled, action packed, and heartfelt.

Many different narratives are presented about the love of the sauce, its history, and in particular the story of David Tran, who brought Sriracha sauce to California and, without any paid advertising by the company itself, has grown into one of the most insane football-fields-of-sauce businesses ever.

Take a spin into the world of mouthwatering spicy sauce of Sriracha!

5 thumbs up - erm stars; where'd i get these 3 extra hands...

Bonus: There is a full Director's Commentary uploaded by the filmmaker Griffin Hammond himself, on Youtube.

And, if you want a DRM-Free HD copy for about the same price as a medium size bottle of sauce itself, Griffin is selling it from the film's official website.  Amazon's HDCP requirement put in place for this title has forced 480p on Linux in Chrome. HDCP doesn't exactly exist on Linux.)",1467590400,,1043,5.034883720930233

6330478,5,B00J3GJL52,"This movie is more than about the now iconic American/Thai/Vietnamese/Chinese hot sauce that anyone who understands the flavor benefits of spicy knows. Before watching this movie I had researched Sriracha because I am fascinated by the rise of spicy in American Culture's food. If you took Mr. Tran's business model to any IV League College's Business Department, Corporate Business, or Investor they would likely treat you like an annoyingly optimistic mosquito and wouldn't let you get through the elevator speech, never mind a business plan presentation. You won't increase the price as demand grows? You want to single source the ingredients? You have basically no budget or staff for advertising? You are not going to patent the flavor or even trademark the name!?! I can see the veins pumping in the lawyer's and MBA professional's heads and them losing all bowel control due to confusion when they find out that this was Rooster Sriracha Sauce's history. And I think I know why. Because Mr. Tran's business model was based on his belief in the integrity of his product and being able to share his gift with the entire without shoving it down your throat through advertising or pricing you out of the experience by jacking up the price. He saw as his sauce's popularity grew that he was making the world a better place for his ""Chili Friends"".

The movie conveys these points in a concise and clear way but what is awesome is that the archetypes established are in fact true! Mr. Tran shows that the core of capitalism is essentially good. He also is a case in point of how many of the trappings of modern capitalism (advertising, price gouging for profit, using the law to remove competitors, not paying a fair price for your source materials) are not necessary if you make a quality product. The effort put towards the above gets in the way of or becomes more important than actually making a quality product that can stand alongside any competitor that arises.",1454284800,,1969,4.84272997032641

6330553,3,B00J3GJL52,"At 30 mins it's not a huge investment to watch, but really there is a lot more that could be told about product or people to make this a more engaging documentary. For instance, it seemed that filmmakers spent as much film time on testimonials from 'people on the street' -""blah I love it!""  ""OMG it's soooo good!"", as they did sharing story about David Tran, let alone the other characters for whom this product has likely changed their lives e.g. the son-in-law, the chile farmer (sole source supplier), the chiles (why these ones? special flavor special location?), the people who work in factory,etc etc. Or rather than other people how more about Mr. Tran's journey. For example, what fortunate circumstances or sacrifices were involved to take the product from 'guy with Blue truck' to million? dollar business?

Before watching this film I knew I loved Sriracha on everything. After watching I know a little about where it came from, that there are other Srirachas, which I would like to try, and that loads of other people love this sauce too.

watch it if you like the sauce, otherwise just try the sauce.... on everything! OMG it's soooo good!!!",1451433600,,1155,4.793969849246231
6330554,5,B00J3GJL52,"This is a great story of cultural blending. The sauce most Americans know and love has Thai origins but was brought over and altered by David Tran. His story and the story of Sriracha is testament to the strengths of capitalism: if a law abiding person sells a good product, he will do well. However, the film is mostly about the sauce, the man, and the phenomenon of sriracha hot sauce. Good fun.",1450051200,,397,4.4520547945205475

This film gives the history of Sriracha and its current story with interviews of past and present.  I've seen Sriracha in stores, tasted it at friend's place, but never knew its background.  I thought it was a spice that came from Hong Kong because I often see it in Chinese restaurants in Chinatowns, but instead, it is a made-in-America spice from a guy who is Chinese in Vietnam who went to Hong Kong, but ended up in America.  It's an inspiring film about a man who came from everything, who had nothing, but became something.  This can also be considered a great business film that should inspire everyone.  I also enjoyed that the film-makers went beyond Sriracha and included further history of other varieties and its origin.",1446681600,,871,4.690789473684211

6330765,5,B00J3GJL52,"Well,.. I used to live in that area and have enjoyed  Huy Fong foods/Sriracha for over ~20-25 years, it's about time someone did a food show on them. I would have liked to have seen a 1hr long version with a bit more about their unique farming and production process.
To me that's what makes Huy Fong foods a really unique product,.. the fact that it's red jalapeos farmed by one farmer in one location and processed very quickly into their 3 products. It's a  food done cheaply and cleanly for everyone to enjoy I think the reason Huy Fong foods are used so much in cooking is that they are really simply produced and with only 3 products containing 1, 2 or 3 ingredients. It is consistent and simple enough to use as a ""standard ingredient"". The whole thing just makes me proud of the southland and their family, best wishes on your new plant in Irwindale.",1445904000,,858,4.424050632911392

I'd come to like Sriracha more than other hot sauces that had too much vinegar for using with most foods (just my opinion).

I have been bringing it home for a long time, but had no idea about the man, and it's history. Short movie and worth the watch while you are enjoying a meal with Sriracha.

It's just a very, very long commercial for Sriracha with absolutely no substance whatsoever. It's an endless stream of hipsters saying how much they like the sauce and not even a single reason why they like it. Peppered in are some moments with the owner and his story, but that essentially is 5 minutes worth in between man on the street interviews of dopey people saying 'it's awesome'.",1444348800,,535,4.702127659574468

They worked it out, but this guy started making sauce in 5 gallon buckets, by hand, and look what he has built.  I think he is more of a hero than the documentary made him out to be, and very astute politically.

6330956,5,B00J3GJL52,"Though only 33 minutes long, Griffin Hammond's little documentary about the ever-popular hot sauce is entertaining throughout and worth the look. Sriracha sauce has grown by leaps and bounds in popularity until now (2015) it has entered the mass culture and inspired sriracha mayonnaise and even potato chips. Talk about coming out of left field, who would have expected a Southeast Asian condiment like this to ever capture America's palate? I first encountered it in Vietnamese restaurants in San Francisco in the late 70's and early 80's and never thought it would migrate out of those places.

I won't be giving too much away to say that Huy Fong Sriracha sauce, the one with the rooster on the bottle is the ubiquitous brand of choice, and is made in one factory in Southern California. All the red jalapeno peppers used in it come from a single farm just an hour or so away from the factory. So despite the many foreign languages on the bottle, it's made right here in the U.S.A. We even get to meet the man who created this particular recipe and who runs the Huy Fong company, David Tran. He was a Chinese man living in Vietnam and was forced to emigrate with all other Chinese when the formerly North Vietnamese government took over. He's a friendly, unassuming man who is obviously really into his product.

During the quickly-passing half hour you will learn far more that you ever thought you would learn about the popular hot sauce. Totally fun when you have a little spare time.",1442707200,,1491,4.708812260536399
6330957,5,B00J3GJL52,"Sooooooo terrific to learn more about the world's best food (even how to say it!) Short viewing, and worth every minute.

6330972,5,B00J3GJL52,"The review here is supposed to be about the film itself, but it is hard to separate it from the sauce, isn't it?  I had never tried Sriracha before I saw this documentary.  After I saw the film I just had to try it and I must admit I am hooked!  The funny thing about that is I have never really liked hot food.  But the sweetness of Sriracha takes away the bite.  Oops!  See, it is hard to separate the sauce from the documentary.  LOL!  Obviously, it is well done if it inspires someone like me to try something I ordinarily would have never bought.  This film is so colorful.  It is fun hearing peoples' stories and seeing all the great foods that Sriracha is used on.  I am so impressed with David Tran's story.  He is such a humble guy and so dedicated to his creation and his consumers.  I can't help but think that it is what America is all about....people coming from other places, working hard and becoming a success.  This is what made us such a unique country of so many mixed cultures that have enriched us and encouraged us to try something new.  Now, I think I'll go have some Sriracha popcorn.  By the way, if you eat some applesauce with whatever you put Sriracha on, it takes the sting out of it.",1442275200,,1213,4.2314410480349345

6331090,2,B00J3GJL52,"This documentary appears to be aimed at A): 13-year-olds who are trying to determine if Sriracha sauce is cool (spoiler: It is), and B). hipster doofuses who have never heard of Sriracha sauce (spoiler: It is wacky, wild, and definitely appropriate for hipsters).

Considering the access this filmmaker had to the Huy Fong plant, the owner, key personnel and suppliers, this is a pretty dumb and disappointing piece of work.

Clocking in at barely 35 minutes, the documentary consists mainly of teenagers and young adults giving testimonials which are extraordinarily uninteresting. Sample snippet of audio - of three interviewees:
""I put it on eggs.""
""I put it on eggs.""
""I put it on eggs.""

The brief sections with the company founder and suppliers are very interesting. There is a classic business case study here. There is a fantastic technical story. It would have been interesting to hear more about the farms or the machines or anything related to the company.

Instead, we get teenagers raving about this crazy hot sauce cause you can put it on anything and I never heard of it and then I tried it and wow it is so hot and so good and ohmigod I have it in my backpack cause I can't live without it.

Full disclosure: About 23 minutes in, as the auteur is showing us clips from crazy, wacky YouTube videos of teenagers and hipsters doing radical stuff like drinking Sriracha from the bottle and putting Sriracha in their beards, I have to admit, I turned off the documentary. At that point it was about 15 minutes of sheer stupidity, and counting, and 8 minutes of worthwhile information. For all I know, the final quarter of the documentary might be riveting, and may be why other people have given it more stars. For me, my quota of dumb for the day had been filled.",1440460800,2,1775,4.676282051282051

6331157,4,B00J3GJL52,"This is a documentary that is more of a hugely entertaining rags-to-riches upbeat biography of the immigrant who founded the Sriracha manufacturing facility and how he has expanded it into an incredible world-wide operation. As an engineer I enjoyed seeing how the factory produces and bottles this pepper-garlic sauce and the California farmer who struggles to grow the peppers in large-enough quantities to fulfill the factory's huge demands. The film indicates this brand of sauce has a ""cult-like"" following. I never tasted it, but after seeing this fascinating film I put this ""rooster-branded"" Sriracha sauce on my shopping list and picked up a couple bottles at Walmart. They cost about $1.60 (quite inexpensive). Guess what. For me, the sauce lives up to the hype. It's hot stuff and really good. By the way, the first ""r"" in Sriracha is silent.",1439251200,,853,5.1

It's also great to finally put a face to the Sriracha hot sauce boss in America, Mr. Tran.

6331257,4,B00J3GJL52,"This was very fun to watch, and very informative! However, my wife and I felt it was just a long commercial for Sriracha. We lived in CA for years and knew that the City of Irwindale had filed a lawsuit against Huy Fong Foods because residents of the city complained about the spiciness in the air burning their eyes, throats, etc. We were surprised this was not mentioned at all in the film, and led us to think of this more as a commercial than a serious documentary. If they are leaving out something like that lawsuit, what else are they not bringing up? This film was funded in part on Kickstarter, and we enjoyed scanning the names of all those who donated at the end.

Also, Mr. Tran is incredibly likable, and ethical as he never felt he could trademark the name sriracha because he didn't invent the idea, just one of the most popular recipes. We love seeing those types on ethics in business people! Overall, the film is bright, colorful, well-edited, well-scored, and uplifting, so what's not to love in the end?

My wife had watched the film while I was at work, and texted asking me to pick up a bottle as she had never tried it since she isn't a fan of spicy stuff. When I got home, we had black bean burgers with sriracha on them while we watched the documentary again together, so the commercial worked for us! The spiciness was a little too hot for my wife, but she cooled it down by munching on some avocado between bites. I've always enjoyed the sauce, though I'm not as fanatical as some of the people in the film.",1437868800,,1534,4.378947368421053

6331476,5,B00J3GJL52,"This was a very informative documentary.  I thought it was going to be a propaganda documentary trying to promote the Sriracha sauce.  But instead it was enjoyable because you learn something in this documentary.

I always thought Tran was a Vietnamese name and that David Tran was a Vietnamese.  And even the ""Vietnamese online"" website stated that Tran is the 2nd largest surname in Vietnam at 11%.  However the documentary tells that David Tran was a Chinese in Vietnam, which came directly from David Tran mouth in the documentary so I have no reason to doubt him. But taken into account that the Vietnamese alphabet is created by the French, thus similar to the French, there could be many variation of the written name Tran with different inflection signs that distinguish them from each other and how it is pronounce, the truth can only be explain in detail by David Tran himself in regard to his statement that he is a Chinese in Vietnam.  And because David Tran is a Chinese, the Communist Vietnamese that won the war over the Democratic Vietnamese at the time did not like the Chineses in Vietnam and kick David Tran out.

Instead of dying at sea as the Communist Vietnamese thought, he made to America and become successful.  I bet the Communist Vietnamese probably say now that David Tran is really Vietnamese and that David Tran is one of them. And if David Tran refutes it, then a 33rd degree Master Communist would counter by saying that David Tran grew up in Vietnam and now he is a traitor because he denies that he is Vietnamese, so watch out as he will betray you too.  Of course David Tran would have to be pretty stupid to be manipulated into buying that crap, especially taken into consideration he could have died at sea instead of being sucessful in America.

In addition, I was not aware that Sriracha sauce was originally created in Thailand and they just imitate it in America.  But I guess that now that Huy Fong Foods has dominated the American market, it would be impossible for the Thailand originator to try to muscle into the American market.

These are just some of the few things that is in this documentary that you will learn about the Sriracha sauce.

If you have time to kill, then watch this over any other video you have on your Netflix or Amazon Prime video list.  You won't regret it.",1436140800,,2327,4.602905569007264

6331619,3,B00J3GJL52,"It's not bad for a 30 min long documentary. It wasn't quite was I was hoping for either, though. It took a full 2/3 of the video before the director gets into the real history of the sauce. For most of the film he furthers the confusion that many people have that Sriracha is a brand, like Tabasco, and not a type of pepper sauce. Sure, maybe this is nit-picking but when you watch a documentary to learn about something you'd like to learn the correct and clear history of that thing. It would have been one thing if Mr. Hammond had named the film ""Sriracha, the Huy Fong foods story"" instead of the all-encompassing ""Sriracha"". It would have also been interesting in his Huy Fong focus to learn more about the troubles David Tran's company had after moving into the new factory with the surrounding neighbors trying to shut down the production of the spicy sauce at that location. I remember rumors of a Sriracha shortage! Not a bad introduction to the sauce for someone with no prior knowledge.",1434153600,,997,4.544444444444444

Then one day I couldn't believe I saw it in a local, american grocery store and that's when I know it was going to go wild.  All that's great but there's a part of me that loved being one of the few eggs that know about this tasty ""secret"".

6331880,5,B00J3GJL52,"I first encountered Sriracha [the rooster version] on Guam in a little Vietnamese place right off the water in Tamuning.  I think it was the first Vietnamese restaurant to open up there after the fall of Saigon.  A good buddy of mine from college took me there and we had pho.  I was hooked on the stuff from the start.  When I came back to the mainland and started to eat in Vietnamese joints here in the Bay Area I was delighted to see the stuff on every table.  The local Asian grocery started it and I took it home and introduced it to everyone I knew.  I had always known a little about the founder of the company and how he had come to the USA and ended up making the stuff down in LA but I had never heard the entire story.  I was delighted to watch this short and turn some of my friends on to it as well.

So if you have fallen in love with Sriracha sauce then watch and learn.  And if you want to explore the other varieties then head to your local Asian supermarket and if it is like Manila Mart near my house there will be 20 or 30 different types.  But Rooster sauce is my mainstay for almost everything.  I mix it in ketchup and use it.  I mix it in mayo and use it.  I use it anywhere I would have used tabasco in a sauce, stew, fried eggs or whatever.",1431820800,,1267,3.9801587301587302

6331882,4,B00J3GJL52,"Remarkable documentary about the 'best hot sauce in the U.S.'. As most people who were interviewed in this documentary, I had no idea how it was made. I knew it was a U.S. Product and made in California.

David Tran, an immigrant from Vietnam, arrived in the U.S., and settled in California. He lived with many other Vietnamese families, and what they missed was their hot sauce. Hot sauce, Sriracha, is a staple in Vietnam. David went about making his own Chile sauce and selling it to Vietnamese neighbors. He would hand pick the chiles and make the sauce by himself. Soon the Sriracha was selling like hot cakes, and to this day he cannot keep up with the demand. There are more orders than he can make. He has several large factories in California and puts out 18,000 bottles a day, 24/7. He is a man without an ego, and he must be worth a fortune, but he works everyday at the factory, supervising. His family works with him. A wonderful man who keeps the price low, and will only stop making Sriracha when people do not want it any longer.

We also travel to Thailand, where Sriracha came from originally. A woman in the seaside town of Sracha made the hot sauce. It has a little different taste. There are many many different types of Sriracha. David Tron has no patent, and I gather has no plans to get one.

We meet many people in the documentary who love Sriracha, we hear phone calls and see emails sent by fans to the Sriracha plant. This hot sauce has taken over the world, and most chefs agree there is always one bottle in their kitchens.

Who knew that the popular Sriracha sauce was a Korean sauce created in the United States by an ethnic Chinese forced out of Vietnam?  OK, probably lots of people, but before this documentary all I knew was that David Tran had lived in Vietnam.  Now I know, and knowing is half the battle (adding Sriracha to your food is the other half).  David Tran's story alone was worth the watch, and I wish the filmmaker had delved more into that, but from his interviews, my guess is that David Tran wants his sauce to speak for him.

And by the way, almost everyone pronounces Sriracha wrong. As you know from this documentary, Sriracha is the name of a village southeast on Thailand's gulf of Siam... it is properly pronounced 'see rat jaa' with the first syllable in a low tone, the 2nd syllable is enunciated quickly and abruptly, then the last part is drawn out. For some reason, it bugs me when people pronounce it 'suh ratcha'  listen to how the Thai people pronounce it in this show! No matter what you call it or how you say it, it's THE best hot stuff ever!!!",1431388800,,743,4.345323741007194

In a pho shop, I spied a guy squirt the stuff liberally on to his pho like we season dishes with salt and pepper.  The only complaint I have is that the stuff oozes out under the cap and makes the whole bottle sticky.

I was surprised to find this product was made here in the US.  The origins of the hot sauce is not known but this story was made unique in that this product was invented by a Chinese man who immigrated from Vietnam to the US.  He saw a need for a sauce and ran with it.  You could say an American success story!",1430784000,,648,4.103174603174603

Mr. Tran: You don't need advertising with Sriracha Sauce. Every Sriracha ""addict"" in America will do it for you. They even make it in one gallon size.
