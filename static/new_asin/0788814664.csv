There are some genius's that slip through the cracks. Also, it is more important  to fulfill one's personal goals and aspirations than to fulfill someone  else's goals for you.

It was very deep and extremely touching -- not to  mention, full of BEAUTIFUL actors who are excellent at their trade.

I thought the movie was great, but what fascinated me (and my friends) was  the ELEVEN deleted scenes that were added as bonus materials.  I personally  think Affleck is a better actor than Damon, and Affleck had about twenty  minutes of footage taken out.  Luckily for his fans, you can see it all in  this Collector's Version of the DVD.  Enjoy!",912988800,2,495,4.293478260869565

83449,5,0788814664,"Can a movie still be a phenomenal experience with no special effects, no sex-n-violence, no zillion dollar sets, and no cliched heroics? You bet. The script of this movie should go down in history as one of the best ever  written. Every line is perfect, every plot twist at once surprising and  poetically inevitable. Anyone who grew up being ""too smart""--or  who loves Boston and Cambridge--will find this film especially appealing,  but anyone who sees this movie will feel deeply for the characters and see  life a little differently when it's over.",911520000,,552,4.956521739130435

83612,2,0788814664,"Did not enjoy this one. I found it tepid and predictable. Matt Damon's character lacked sympathy. After all, he was a genius working as a janitor, who could turn around his life in a moment's notice if he wanted to. And let's face it...everyone knew he would do that, right? So why did I feel trapped into listening to every major cast member deliver a overlong monologue (or two)? It was as if I was sitting in an acting school on casting agent night. Nope. Didn't work for me and I felt that this movie could have ended in fifteen minutes if Robin Williams, Minnie Driver, and Ben Affleck had simply pounced on Damon and throttled him for a few seconds while yelling, ""Are you out of your friggin' mind?""",1510358400,,706,4.438461538461539

It turns out I haven't seen it.  Very good movie, great story-line and superb acting by Matt Damon and Robin Williams.  Robin Williams nails every movie that he ever made with believable acting abilities.  And of course I love the Affleck brothers...Ben and Casey.  This movie really made me think about my own life and how a person can avoid relationships, love and opportunities because of painful memories from the past.  It is only through reaching for help, compassionate people who care and taking a chance that one can truly step out of the past and into the future and its possibilities.  This truly spoke to me on many levels.  One of the best movies that I have seen in awhile..

Wether it be a story that is well written or as a movie that I, personally, LOVE.  This movie touches on the ""diamond in the rough"", inner demons of genius and the need for perspective, in either case.

-Congrats to Ben Affleck and Matt Damon for... what was clearly a labor of love and true collaboration.
-Add in the best whimsically gritty director, Gus Van Sant.
- Plus what is THE best (and this is saying something!) performance by  Robin Williams.

The result, this movie that has and will stand the test of time.

***In further detail***
  -The writing of this film script is near perfection.
It touches on visceral topics, like Love, Anger, Loyalty, Genius and even the seemingly side-character-trait of joking to offset the seriousness (i.e. defense mechanism)... All of this without ever glorifying one or any as being ""the right way"".
  -(The last point was probably equally, if not more, Van Sant,as the director.)
  -My mother has said often, ""It's comedians that really know how to do drama"".  This is proof.  It's funny, when you look at Williams history, the man knew drama, but I digress.
THE SCENE OF HIS SECOND MEETING WITH WILL IN THE PARK is one of the best scenes ever designed.

83714,5,0788814664,"His floor waxer/buffer by his side, Will (Matt Damon), a young janitor at MIT,  pauses at a hallway blackboard to solve an elaborate mathematical problem. This 20-year-old self-taught, exceedingly literate prodigy, with a thug's extensive rap sheet, becomes the singular focus of a wonderstruck award-winning professor, combinatorial (new one for me) mathematician (Stellan Skarsgard). But just as he's discovered, Will's back in jail for street brawling. His terms of release are that he agree to work with Prof. Lambeau and simultaneously enter psychotherapy. After mocking and traumatizing the first 5 clinicians, he ends up with an amazingly good fit for him, Sean McGuire ( Robin Williams). I don't want to reveal more of the storyline.  This is an exceptional film, cowritten by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who also provide first-rate performances. Robin Williams' acting is stunning. All the cast is excellent, as are all the filmmaking disciplines. The piece is authentic, smart, insightful, full of Will's Boston neighborhood atmosphere. It's wonderfully paced, the dramatic story unfolding and building powerfully and successfully. Directing (Van Sant), cinematography (Escoffier), editing (Scalia), music (Elliott Smith and Dan Elfman) et al., are top-notch. This is a film that invites more than one viewing, holding its value across time. Highly recommend.",1488585600,2,1369,5.640776699029126

84008,5,0788814664,"My 2017 New Years resolution is to watch movies I missed in the theater but still wanted to see years later.  This was second on the list, and needs to be on everyones list.  The plot line of a minimally educated young janitor (Will Hunting played by Matt Damon) solving advanced linear algebra problems on Harvard chalkboards may not sound appealing, but rest assured that you can relate to this movie.  We all sat next to that high school classmate who aced exams after barely studying.  Although we hated that guy, we cant hate Will Hunting because of his tortured past that you cant fully understand until the end of the movie.

Robin Williams appears in the movie later than expected, and his role is understated but critically important.  Knowing that we can no longer see new movies from this brilliant actor, its even more important not to miss his surprising and heartbreaking role.

Its easy to take Ben Affleck for granted because of his role as Will Huntings smart-Alec friend.  But one of the best scenes in the movie is initiated by Affleck when he angrily tells Will to make something of himself because so few people have the opportunities invited by Wills rare gift.  This prompts the sad-but-happy scene at the end of the movie when Will decides to change.

Minnie Driver makes the most of her script, but her character is a caricaturized female mess when Will refuses to move with her to California.  The screenwriters could have done better by presenting a believable female Harvard scholar with her own complicated dimensions.

Classic movie that you will appreciate for different reasons at different times in your life.",1483488000,12,1642,4.825

A little heavy on the South Boston stereotypes and a little light on the multi ethnic character of Boston and especially MIT but perhaps they weren't trying for realism.  Take a walk down Vassar St. or wander into the MIT Coop and tell me if you think the ethnicity of the students was properly represented.  Haley Joel Osment may see only dead people but clearly Matt Damon only sees white people.,1476403200,,515,4.908045977011494

84477,5,0788814664,One of the best movie I love to watch...I have many of them. I loved it from very first time I watched. I repeat regularly... anytime and anywhere...very entertaining!,1475884800,,167,4.793103448275862
84478,3,0788814664,"3STARS...NOT BECAUSE IT ISN'T A GOOD MOVIE BECAUSE IT IS BUT I fell asleep on this movie five times before I just got determined to see it through but I fell asleep and had to rewound it many times to see the end with clarity.  I doubt if I will ever watch it again because I am sure I would fall asleep but not from boredom... because IT IS NOT BORING but the context gets too comfortable and it does get too predictable.  A movie like this... you want it to end the way it ends; you don't want WILL to lose his chance to have a good American life especially when he's born with special talents and traits: he's a """"""mathematical artist"""""""".
He's a 'math artist' until he proves that he is a ''''mathematical master''''.
That's the way I like to view it.  He has to do the work.  He has to do it for his country and do it for himself because he's not there.  He doesn't feel ''privileged''... he doesn't want to embrace such a life.  He's been beaten down; he wants to stay there and wallow in self-pity while yearning to get up and do something that he knows he can do but then that's the part about himself he wants to hate but he can't.  He needs a bit convincing.  And  Will Hunting understands that but what he doesn't like about it is this: he feels owned and manipulated and pushed into something when he isn't ready for.  He isn't clear about himself and who he is (at that age; we all suffer some of that).  Will wants to escape yet stay the same...like his buddies declared upon themselves.

I do love Robin Williams and I do like Matt Damon but these are the same performances they do in the future in other movies.  I'm just now seeing ""Hunting"" in 2016.  I have seen other productions, which ends up being ''''in the future''''while watching this movie now is looking into the past.  NO MATTER.  These guys are great on the screen past, present and will be in the future.  THAT CHEMISTRY IS THERE.  In fact, that's what this film is: ""good chemistry"" and that may be the reason I can't stay awake to watch it because ""it didn't have me holding on to my seat"";  ""I was very comfortable'' and cozy knowing there was nothing to fear ...and WILL would get all the perks and the girl too.  ALL THAT HELP.  WILL HUNTING GOT A LOT OF HELP.  THAT WAS IN 1997, or so.

Our country is better  when we get our young people launched with our help.

I say this in October, 2016... just before a most HAZARDOUS election.  We don't know where our country is headed and we have lots of ""rogue cops"" across the country..  People are being killed for no reason at all.  It's very scary times; very intense; America has cells of terrorism.
AND THAT'S REAL, REALLY, REALLY REAL.  ""GOOD WILL HUNTING"" IS IDEAL, REALLY, REALLY IDEAL.
So now I see WHY I can't set-in with this movie.  In this day and times: GOOD WILL -IS NOT-  HUNTING!!!",1475884800,,2829,4.301136363636363

84579,3,0788814664,"This movie is about 20 years old and was made when the lead actor (Matt Damon) was quite young. He plays the role of a genius who happens to be working as a janitor but somehow can figure out problems that no trained scientist could figure out. Though the movie has a solid story-line and good acting, I did not feel it deserves more than three stars due to the following weaknesses:
1) the supporting acting role was miscast to Ben Affleck whose acting appeared superficial and wooden
2) Matt Damon also does not come across as a typical janitor by appearance and upkeep of himself but later in the movie seems to be molding into his genius persona a bit better
3) Too many use of f-word in every sentence and loud yelling does not make up for deficiency in acting

But generally, it is a respectable movie with a nice story though the ending is a bit stupid. It is fun to watch and to my liking where nobody gets killed. It seems to me the supporting role actors in the film outperform the lead characters, namely: Stellan Skarsgrd (as Professor Lambeau) and Minnie Driver (as Skylar).",1475020800,,1087,4.4623115577889445

84714,4,0788814664,"I purchased this movie for one reason, the park scene.  When Robin Williams expresses the love he has for his deceased wife, I sob.  I feel in my heart  the very words he shares with Matt Damon. When Robin Williams turns to Matt Damon and tells him that he doesn't know what it's like to stay up half the  night holding your wife's hand and having the doctors see in your eyes that the term visiting hours doesn't apply to you, I WEEP.  The discussion between those two men on that park bench was a true teachable moment. It also reminds me that there are men who sincerely love their wives and you can't beat that with a silver spoon.",1470700800,,635,4.258333333333334

Camera angles were fine, the way the story was told was fine, but I could not get into the story and I could not believe in the characters, nor could I care for them. I mean I like the premise of their being this kid with a troubled history, who just so happens to have a brilliant mind, but as fate would have it Mr. Damon never really struck me as exceptionally intelligent, in character or in real life. I mean he's no Neil Postman you know?

As for the dialog and the plot surrounding this kid... well I could give a crap less, it was cliche' and utterly boring. I gave up, obviously.",1466726400,2,720,4.063380281690141

84796,1,0788814664,"Derivative, predictable crap. Possibly the worst ever best screenplay oscar winner. We are expected to believe that this creature formed close personal relationships that were unbreakable bonds (bonds alarmingly quickly discarded at the end when he runs off into the sunset with his best girl by his side) while learning more about the law than the lawyers, more about history than the history students, more about physics than the physics students, more about life than pretty much everyone. It really doesn't add up. Watch any biopic about any celebrated genius. It isn't that easy for any of them, even Mozart. Will Hunting is apparently superhuman. Not very witty though. That would tend to rely on his writers. Dull morons enjoying celebrity status and priveleged upbringings. I read an early draft of this rubbish which included an exchange between the main male characters which was, in fact, an old joke. This obviously didn't appear in the film  but was clearly a pathetic attempt to emulate the sort of brilliant dialogue which characterised the then, justifiably, very popular Quentin Tarantino films. This is formulaic, adolescent s*** and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.",1459468800,5,1188,5.219895287958115

85385,5,0788814664,"This was a fantastic movie with a lot of great lessons taught in the movie. Some of the great lessons were go big even if you don't have much, follow your dreams, and let other people help you be better than you already are in life. This was a great movie for teachers to watch and it shows how much teachers and or a counselor has a huge effect on students. This movie shows how teachers actions and words influence children so much because children look up to older people. Also it shows teachers how much they should push their students, because they should push their students but not too much. Just like Shawn pushed Will into being his own man and doing his own stuff but he didn't push him to much. It also shows that friends should push each other so they can be the best they can be, for example when Wills friend told him to go out and get a job and leave his crappy job. I recommend teachers to watch this movie 100% because it has some amazing strategies and and really gets down to the point which is go out and do the best you can and live for the things that make you happy. This movie was also very entertaining and a great movie all around.",1444089600,,1157,4.192825112107624

85483,5,0788814664,"Good Will Hunting really connected with me on a deep personal level. While I am not a Will Hunting level genius, because of my physical disability I can definitely relate to many of the feelings of being let down by people and trust issues that the Will character faces. Somewhat sadly, I also know what its like to have all this potential and yet not living up to the abilities I have.

I thought everybody was terrific and played their role perfectly. I especially liked the contrast between the university professor and the psychologist where one pushes Will towards a life of academics and knowledge, while the psychologist pushes him to find who he is. That is the way it so often goes in life with parents and friends pushing people in one direction, while you want to travel in another. The level of realism here was amazing.

Good Will Hunting is a film that really speaks to anyone who has ever gone searching for something or who questions whether there is more to life.",1441238400,,980,4.594285714285714

85503,4,0788814664,"Will Hunting (Matt Damon) was blessed with a photographic memory or an off-the-charts I.Q. However, a neglectful childhood threatened to derail him. Growing up, he had been to several foster homes, and the state removed him from three because of serious physical abuse. His lengthy criminal rap sheet listed: assault twice, grand theft auto, impersonating an officer, mayhem, theft, and resisting. In court, he acted as his own lawyer, without peripheral legal counsel or representation. In each of his trials, he argued so convincingly on his behalf before the judge that the case was thrown out, all were overturned. His past was prologue to a script that repeated itself. His early youth was a template so embedded in his psyche. Fear of abandonment caused him to subconsciously sabotage forming relationships to eschew being hurt. A natural defense mechanism that was beyond his control and no fault of his own. To reprogram his dysfunctional thought processes and learned responses, hortatory psychotherapy sessions with the illustrious and preeminent, Sigmund Freud protege (Robin Williams) were arranged.",1440892800,,1111,5.427745664739884

Overall the Prime streaming service works like a charm, but about every 15 minutes or so the video distorts just a bit (with everything we stream through Amazon, not just Good Will Hunting), with this single white line flickering across the screen out of nowhere. We also have Netflix and Crunchyroll, and rent an occasional movie off of Sony's PlayStation Network, and never have issues with the quality of the stream. Thought it was worth mentioning.

85589,5,0788814664,"I think this is a great movie to watch if you're looking for something to lift your spirits. This is a great movie about friendship, overcoming hardship, living up to your potential, and knowing that love is more important than all of the above. Matt Damon plays a troubled but brilliant youth. He is noticed by a university professor who takes him under his wing to teach him everything he could be capable of. Unfortunately, Damon has a history of violence and in order for the university professor (played by Skarsgard) to get him out of the system, Damon must consent to receiving counselling. Most counselors are scared away by Damon, as he seems to have the ability to turn the tables on all of his psychiatrists. That is until he meets Dr. Maguire, who has been through hardships of his own. Maguire won't give up on the kid (Damon) and the two become friends. Dr. Maguire helps Damon see what is important in life and to move on from his troubled past. A great and inspirational movie.",1438387200,2,993,4.584269662921348

85608,5,0788814664,"I LIKE DEM APPLES

This is absolutely one of the best movies ever made. Is it a stretch to think that any kid in his early 20's without formal training could easily understand applied mathematics at a Harvard level? Yes. It's also a movie. It's also totally unrealistic that a couple kids in their early 20's without formal training as writers could win an Oscar for best original screen play.....oh...wait.

As for the story, it's a great story about living up to one's potential. But more importantly it's about being true to yourself and doing what's right by yourself, not what's right for other people. That's why Robin Williams and Matt Damon match up so well because both of their characters have achieved less than they are capable of professionally. The difference being that Robin Williams did so by choice and Matt Damon does so out of fear.

It's a brilliant movie. It's one of the all time classics that you just have to see.",1438214400,2,938,4.672727272727273

85620,3,0788814664,"A formulaic and predictable movie based on the implausible genius of a a young man from south Boston (Matt Damon) who suppresses his unbounded intelligence and stays in the hood out of loyalty to his friends and because he was an orphan. Got it so far?  Such a genius, he can use some variant of f*** three times in every sentence as noun, verb, adjective, and/or adverb.  So clever, a smart, pretty, pre-med student falls in love with him.  As luck would have it, Robin Williams is also an unfulfilled genius from south Boston, who becomes Matt Damon's psychologist and who cures him by repeating the magic phrase five times, ""it's not your fault, it's not your fault, it's not your fault...""  With this break-through therapy Matt is able to leave the hood, quit saying f***, and live happily ever after, presumably with the hot, pre-med student, who will presumably become a rich and famous physician.  You get the point.  Three stars for choice of songs in soundtrack and Robin William's performance.",1437436800,,1003,4.8023255813953485

85774,5,0788814664,"One of my all-time favorite movies on so many levels, and the soundtrack music is splendid.  This is a powerful story of a troubled young, lower-working class man (Matt Damon) who is a natural math ""savant"" and a voracious reader, without ever having gone to college.  At one point, well into the movie, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) compares Matt Damon's character (named ""Will"") to the extraordinary Srinivasa Ramanujan--historically known as ""The Man Who Knew Infinity."" Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician who made great leaps of contributions in the field of math, without any formal training.  The professor who made this comparison, played by Stellan Skarsgard, becomes the ""Salieri"" to Matt Damon's ""Mozart.""

  In this movie, ""Good Will Hunting,"" Will works as a janitor, pushing a broom through the halls of MIT, where all around him, young people of greater economic means are getting a top-knotch education.  Will is ""discovered"" by the MIT professor, soon after the professor puts a difficult math problem on a chalkboard in the hallway, which he hopes one of his students will be smart enough to solve by the end of the semester.  I don't want to spoil the fun by telling you what happens next, but let's skip to the fact that Will--due to his ""wrong side of the tracks"" roots, is not ""ready"" to participate in society the way we wish we could bring the poor into better economic circumstances.  He is on parole for assault and battery, he has the attention span of a hummingbird, and he abhors authority and decorum.  Enter Robin Williams, as the ""last-chance"" psychotherapist brought in to try to help young Will, after a bevy of more ""high class"" psychotherapists fail to make headway and wind up bruised. The interactions between Williams and Damon will have you, by turns, laughing out loud and then crying and then laughing again: very compelling cinema.  Add to all of this the beautiful ""pre-Med,"" highly-educated coed, played delightfully by Minnie Driver, whom Will falls in love with, but tries to push away like everything else in his mixed-up life; and Will's best friend, played by Ben Affleck, who turns out to be the surprise ""pivot"" around which Will makes his most important decision of the movie.  The soundtrack to this movie is haunting -- I bought the CD after seeing this movie for the first time when it first came out.  I am reviewing it now, after watching it a third time, years and years later.  My love for the film held up, and I noticed new subtleties this time around.  Let me list three compelling reasons to see this movie:

  1.  Watch it for the story:  This is character development at its finest, and the story is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally heart-rending and heart-warming. The movie does not stoop to cliche developments, like ""poor boy makes it big.""  The characters will each surprise you in their own way.
  2.  Watch it for the science:  This movie will awaken you to the truly fascinating minds of natural ""savants,"" and how they are not determined by anything related to ""nurture.""  Will had a childhood that could have left him mentally incapacitated.  There are other movies about savants:  Think ""Rain Man,"" or ""Little Man Tate,"" but neither of those movies treat this issue as seriously as this one does.  This movie is on a much more sophisticated level -- more like the movie, ""A Beautiful Mind,"" about the inimitable and recently-deceased Princeton mathematician John Forbes Nash, Jr.
  3.  Watch it for the social philosophy:  With no partisan leanings whatsoever, this movie will leave you convinced of the need to increase educational opportunity in this country, while reminding the viewer that ""giving a man a fish"" (to ""eat"" for one day) is not the answer.  Unless you can teach a man how to fish for a lifetime, any ""charity"" is essentially wasted on him, like the professor's early attempts to ""provide"" for ""poor Will"" shows us, in sharp delineation.  At the end of this movie, you will find yourself asking how many others like Will might be out there, but will wind up in jail, instead of in college, because they did not pass a chalkboard in the hallway, while pushing their broom.  The movie makes clear that throwing money at the problem is a disaster.  The world, and the people in it, are more complex than that.  You will still be thinking about this movie, LONG after you watch it.

  Oh, one caveat:  My socially-reserved neighbors tell me they could not watch this movie through to the end because of the liberally-sprinkled cuss words in it.  So alert-alert that some of the very real characters in this movie speak just as they would in South Boston.

That distracted me to the point that I missed ""the point"" of the movie. I won't describe the movie as that is provided in the synopsis. Now it's about 18 years later, I'm desensitized to the F word, and I just watched this movie again three days ago. It is an f'ing (how's that for desensitized?) great movie.  Matt Damon and Robin Williams, specifically, are incredible. I laughed, I cried, and I watched the ending with a smile and kept smiling through the credits. This movie launched the careers of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Deservedly so.",1433376000,,703,4.449612403100775

85906,2,0788814664,"This is NOT a review of the film itself! It is a masterpiece I would be giving it 5/5 right now if it weren't for the horrible job Miramax did with the DVD release.
The box says that it is in proper 16:9 Widescreen format. The box lies. This is clearly a transfer from back in the days before HD TVs were common. Which is fine, that happens. But it should not still be on shelves!
The problem lies in the fact that the picture plays in a tiny box in the middle of the screen between thick black bars on the top, bottom, left and right.
I unfortunately can't get my money back. But I just wanted to warn anyone else who is a stickler for quality that they should pass on this release.",1431043200,,683,4.066666666666666

86029,5,0788814664,"I enjoyed every second of this spectacular movie and I really connected with the characters because of the film containing such an amazing script that has great character descriptions with the two main ideas being there: attitudes (like their: past, intentions, dreams, nightmares, and more), this explains why they act/do the certain ways/things that they do; and finally their relationships (romantic and platonic), something you watch them either create or destroy. The script also has great, well-known lines. The most iconic one, which was spoken by Robin Williams (as Sean Maguire) to Matt Damon (as Will Hunting), being, you don't know real loss because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself.
 The cinematography of this film has amazing aspects like extraordinarily clear pictures, beautiful sceneries, great camera placement/angles, and more, however, if they did not cast the same series of extremely talented actors/actresses like the original then this movie would not be nearly as good. I am however, not particularly fond of Matt Damon, but he did an amazing job as Will Hunting, yet, even with that being said, I still believe that Robin Williams is the best actor in the film and also one of the greatest actors of all time.
 Good Will Hunting is about Will Huntings life and how because unfortunately he grew up in the wrong (a poor) neighborhood he was unable to afford college. Even though Will never go the luxury of a college education hes still extremely smart (especially mathematics). Since Will never attended college though, his full potential and talents are wasted on his job as a janitor at MIT. At MIT he accidentally draws attention to himself by solving an equation which none of Professor Gerald Lambeaus students were able to answer. Eventually Professor Lambeau discovers its Will Hunting after he catches him solving equations and then he takes him under his wing.
 Professor Lambeau helps Will out of jail because of Wills immense knowledge, however, in exchange for his freedom Will is required to meet with a therapist, which does not go very well. Will continually and purposely annoys/angers all of his therapist which makes it impossible for a therapist to want to stay and they all end up deciding to discontinue their treatment plans. After the many failed therapists, Professor Lambeau calls Sean Maguire to ask him to become Wills new therapist, but Sean immediately says no and denies the offer to become a therapist again and instead stays at his current job as a college professor. Although, Sean eventually changes his mind says yes and agrees to meet with Will for a therapy session, and this is the moment, in my personal opinion, when the movie really starts getting interesting and entertaining.",1428451200,,2780,5.065502183406114

I'm the guy you should be feeling sorry for, I knew half way through it sucked, but I watched it to the end so I could write a review.  Robin Williams takes himself too serious, in this movie and in real life.  Robin Williams is that way in several of his movies, ""Dead Poet's Society"", ""Mrs. Doubtfire"".  Too bad he suffered from depression and killed himself.  It seems he was just playing himself in this movie.  With all the great reviews I thought it might be good.  The story is pretty much just a fantasy, not how anything actually happens in real life.  The amazing thing is how many people think this is a good movie.",1427760000,3,775,4.326388888888889

86345,3,0788814664,"I was quite interested in the movie for awhile.  One of the main charachers was a janitor who solved a difficult mathematical problem.  He ran with a group of young people who went to bars a gang, hurt people physically a lot and had a rap sheet a mile long for assault.. Meanwhile a math professor at MIT looked up the person and took him under his wing.  However he continued to hurt people and wound up in jail.  The professor bailed him out and one of the conditions of his parole was that he sees a therapist.  He saw several and nothing good happened as they could not reach him.  Finally a friend of the professor who is a therapist reached him and got down to his core problem.  Now what I can't understand was that the professor gave him a list of jobs. He applied for one and was going to take it. Now this is silly.  His gang bought him a car to drive to his new job.  He declined the job and went to see a girl.  That is the big wonderful thing?  I thought he would do more with his mathematical skill. He no longer associated with his gang.  I found the ending quite puzzling and the movie although good for awhile to me became not good as I had thought it would be.  The big thing is he went to see a girl and drove off to see her.
Acting was quite good, the script not too good all around.",1423440000,,1304,4.046875

The tears streaming from your eyes can as easily come from his humor as from the gut wrenching exploration of Will's soul. Which brings us to Matt Damon who is no slouch. He was a newcomer when he both wrote and starred in this film but his promise was already evident. This film has stood the test of time and, now, after Robin's death, it is a comforting but of nostalgia that does the actor honor.",1421366400,,567,4.3584905660377355

86384,5,0788814664,"I don't know how to review a movie in such a way that interests others, especially one that's been out quite a while like this one.  If you haven't seen this film, rent it before buying it.  Many of my friends said it was boring to them, and I think it didn't do very well at the theaters when it was newly released.  However, as you can see by my rating, like this movie a lot.  The story is emotional, realistic and well written in my opinion.  And I think that all the actors did a great job.  It's probably my favorite Robin Williams movie, and one of my favorite Matt Damon flicks.  I like the subtle messages, the things NOT said and the lack of over-the-top production that is 99% of movies these days.  There are times when I'm in the mood for those too, but it's refreshing to watch a movie with human beings doing human things and having realistic conversations.  I thought Minnie Driver was an odd casting choice, but she makes it work so well.  She definitely plays the character well.  She was like people I actually know and like.

If you've seen this and are just looking to own an HD version as I did, this is a great disc.  I haven't checked out any of the extras, but I'm not usually very interested in those.  This isn't a movie with a lot of scenic value like mountain vistas etc, but it still is much more enjoyable to me in HD and filling the display area of my TV better than the DVD or standard definition versions.",1421020800,,1439,4.242647058823529

86462,1,0788814664,"This could be a good movie with very sophisticated depictions on subtle psychological moves. However, I am almost sure that most people who know how a genius piece of work has been produced in the history will find the plot artificial and boring. The contrast between bright genius and a blue-color juvenile delinquent having physically abused childhood might be a good material to use, but they could have treated it much more carefully.

You should refer to the story of Dr. Srinivasa Ramanujan, which was talked in the conversation between Professor Lambeau and Sean.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan
Instead of spending most of his free time drinking and fighting, Ramanujan was simply doing mathematics. This is how a genius piece of work is done. Unlike paintings, novels, etc., mathematical work cannot be done instantly. The nature of art is very different.

86668,4,0788814664,"Who even cares except professional therapists, at least in so far as to how the treatment was carried out. Not Freudian. Not Jungian. Not Cognitive Behavioral either. It looked to me like a Rankian treatment (Otto Rank) with some Adlerian (Alfred Adler) added for social development. Or as I would call it, it seem a variation of what modern psychoanalysts call Relational psychotherapy. Fun story.  Emotionally gripping (at times), too often banal and appropriately heartwarming. Way interesting in light of Williams's self-selected means of ending his own life and the psychological battles he waged all his life",1417996800,,614,5.329896907216495
86669,1,0788814664,"It certainly is a movie of quality, except in quality of speech (see next paragraph).  The camerawork and acting are very capably done.  Matt Damon and Robin Williams have excellent chemistry together as a defensive young man named Will who has been a juvenile delinquent after growing up an orphan, and a therapist who is finally able to break through to his heart and help him heal and mature.  There are sections of the movie where the way in which Williams reveals details of his life feels so natural and fascinating, like how real conversations would develop.  I love how well written those parts were.  There are also a few clever parallel things toward the end involving Will's friend and Robin Williams both discovering signs at the same time about Will making his life's choice, and Will adopting his therapist's motto as his own at the end.  (I gave away no spoilers.)  The emotional journey of the characters is very well done, and the emotional healing of Will very rewarding.  The only extensive dialogue that I thought was poorly conceived was when Will explains why he won't take on a national security job, because he doesn't want to be indirectly responsible for later crimes done by the US government and other people.  He says it way too quickly, as if he'd already thought through his whole roundabout logic, but because he says it TOO quickly, without a single pause, it sounds like he just memorized lines and recited 'em, the opposite effect of what was intended.

I would have loved the movie without the language and sex, which of course went together.  Much of the movie takes place in distasteful scenes where Will and his buddies have sexual talk, and Will gets sexually active before marriage and is unkind to his girlfriend.  So what if a lot of people are unpleasant like this group?  It doesn't mean a movie has to be filled with their awful discussions and wanton lifestyles.  However, it's the cussing more than the sexual content which really drove me crazy.  I am baffled as to why the ratings system means directors and writers feel compelled to insert f words before a lot of nouns, and sh words in place of the word ""stuff"".  Even having cussing whenever they want characters to be mean to each other is something they THINK they need but don't actually need.  Humphrey Bogart's movies in the 1940s were filled with moments where he could be a jerk to someone and say the f and sh words to 'em, but because of censorship, his characters didn't cuss.  Yet no one is claiming Bogart's characters would have seemed tougher by adding a bunch of cussing.

We should be celebrating characters in films who don't cuss freely, who choose their words carefully rather than recklessly.  Instead, even the Robin Williams character who's the hero cusses so frequently, and he's not even mad most of the time, just talking that way habitually.  It's like the Martin Scorsese effect has permeated the entire movie industry, so that whenever a movie is intended as an R-rated one, they feel like they have to include as many cuss words as will flow in a sentence.  I would think the power of such words would actually be diminished rather than increased by the liberal use of cuss words.  It's really really pitiful that actors as great as these would choose to write and play in movies with such cussing.  Even if cussing were for the purpose of adding ""flavorful"" dialogue, why do so much of it, like adding an extreme amount of some spice/herb/garlic?  Imdb's Parental Guide for the movie says it has 154 f words and 29 sh words!  I don't even think most people would in reality cuss as much as they do in this movie:  I don't think a single conversation lacks cussing, and it's always gotta be the f word.  What a sad way to live, dependent on disrespectful words to engage in even normal conversation.  I thought of giving this 2 stars, but the cussing is so irritating to listen to that it deserves only 1, and I wish the Academy Awards wouldn't even be considered for movies that go this overboard.",1417996800,3,4030,4.6525423728813555

The story line is one which has been explored before with Charlie / Flower for Algernon - but the key difference is that the brilliant person portrayed here was not made via chemicals, but was always there deep inside this very coarse individual who could really help make a difference in the world, but for the most part just didn't give a flying F-Bomb...  He evolved, much like Charlie, over the course of the story, fell in love and things started changing for him - he actually started to develop core values which could lead to far greater things.  We are left wondering at the end of the story.  A not so thinly veiled attempt to leave the story open for a sequel..

I am glad I rented it.

This movie was very touching, inspirational, and overall moving. Not to mention poignant. I am going to school for Psychology and seeing Robin Williams play the role of a psychologist really backed up my decision to pursue that career path. It inspired me to be the very best therapist I can in order to help everyone, even the most difficult and trying patients.

Their excessive use foul language was also destructive to their point. Narratively you want each character to have their own voice, thus each character having different types of speech patterns which helps to round their characters and show that there is a different mind in each person. Sadly the use of so many uses of the F-word that the characters seemed to all be created by one man rather than being actual separate individuals.

Robin Williams had also performed amicably well in this movie. While this is no real comedy but there is plenty of laughs and chuckles. Yes just like most movies there is a girl, but this is not a romantic movie of any common sorts but without adding any spoilers I can tell you that both Matt and Robin Williams preform superbly from both a comedic and theatrical perspective.

Misunderstood and constantly berated he weathers a steady stream of abuses daily, never breaking. Through it all he prevails and ends up no longer stuck riding in the back of the car, but in the climactic concluding scenes ascends to the shotgun position in the car.

Great movie, was intrigued by the choice of such focus on support characters as opposed to the main star but it works in this instance.",1415664000,,502,4.704545454545454

This movie and Dead Poets Society are my two favorite Robin Williams' films. Highly recommend the film to his fans and people who enjoy movies that show character growth and transformation.

86980,1,0788814664,"Call me an old fuddy-duddy if you wish, but this video was a great story that was ruined by far too excessive use of foul language. There were probably at least two uses of the f word every minute, which added nothing to the story, but made me feel more slimy each time. And the scene where 5 boys loudly spewing foul language in a restaurant were joined by this smart young lady who planned to become a doctor, and who was admired by Will, then told the most ridiculous joke about oral sex, and they all laughed histerically.

And we were supposed to have respect for this intelligent lady? A pastor I knew once said that in any society that fails, the first thing to go is the language. Talk to any teacher today about the language at school, and perhaps you might be concerned.

Perhaps this is not the place to rant about this, but so be it.",1415577600,14,845,4.275

Matt Damon plays the role of a genius, who doesn't attend the top university, but he's the guy who cleans the floors. He's extremely smart, and the person who realizes his talent is Robin Williams, who plays the role of a psychology professor.

The professor finds out that the janitor was the only one to be able to figure out a formula he wrote on a blackboard, and develops an interest in the young janitor. As they become friends, the professor realizes the young janitor needs help to stay out of trouble, and away from the courts.

They share their personal lives together, and the professor attempts to help the young man, who has great potential. The Acting was incredible. The story was engaging, and inspiring. Brilliant, and entertaining throughout. Highly recommended!",1413417600,2,923,4.987012987012987

87177,5,0788814664,"THE FILM: GOOD WILL HUNTING, even though there really aren't any narrative surprises, is filled with wonderful dialogue and bolstered by strong performances. The story is about Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who is a bit of a hard case when it comes to his personal life, but is also a mathematical genius. Together with the help of an MIT professor (Stellan Skarsgard) and a psychologist (Robin Williams) he comes to understand his true potential. The best parts of the film are the many dialogue scenes, some emotionally deep and others biting, that add so much depth to the characters. This was a passion project for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and it shows. The dialogue felt natural and true to life, which adds to the authenticity of the overall experience. Though everyone (including Ben Affleck) turns in an excellent performance, Matt Damon and Robin Williams are especially good. Matt Damon is the hard-headed young adult who is afraid to let people in, and Robin Williams is a professor with experience and insight that he uses to get to Will. Even though the narrative structure wasn't the tightest, there was something to enjoy about every scene, and all of them added something to the overall picture. I should also mention that Minnie Driver does a great job as Will's girlfriend, and Casey Affleck has a few of the best lines. As far as other aspects go I enjoyed the score, which was never intrusive or told the audience how to feel. There was also a rather eclectic soundtrack which fit the moods of various scenes perfectly. Overall, it was a superbly written film with equally good performances.

THE DISC: The audiovisual quality is spectacular, as would be expected from a Blu-ray. What sets this apart from other titles is, befitting the many awards it won, a plethora of extra material which enrich the overall experience. The two best extras are a feature-length commentary with Gus Van Sant, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and an hour-long, multi-part retrospective feature on the making of the film. There were a number of anecdotes which were interesting and insightful, probably most of all by Kevin Smith (yes, that Kevin Smith) who was a co-producer. Among the other extras are 11 deleted scenes with audio commentary, a production featurette, and a music video.

OVERALL: Highly deserving of all the awards it received, the writing and acting is spectacular, and it gets the royal treatment on Blu-ray. While a lot of Oscar-winning films don't stand the test of time, this one deals with universal themes in an honest and realistic way. If you haven't seen it (or bought it), you owe it to yourself to get this definitive edition.",1410652800,3,2655,4.871681415929204

87204,5,0788814664,"It's been a while since I watched Robin Williams act, and Good Will Hunting is the first time I have seen one of his performances since he died. Although I am a fan of his comedy, I much prefer his serious roles. Movies such as Dead Poets Society, One Hour Photo and Insomnia proved that Williams was more than a comedian. In Good Morning Vietnam, he was able to blend comedy with drama to good effect. It's fair to say that Good Will Hunting would be far less effective without Williams in one of his two best performances (Dead Poets Society).

The story consists of several important elements that are present in all or most of our lives, and one that is far less common:

Will Hunting (Damon) is a genius, but he spends his life hanging out with his buddies from Southie. To him, friendship is far more important than his potential. He works in construction, spends his free time in bars, and isn't afraid to pick fights without any real reason to do so. He's the central character in the film, as you might suspect after reading the title. As the story unfolds, we learn more about his past, his motivations, and his possible future.

Ben Affleck is convincing as Hunting's most loyal friend, and it's obviously a friendship that exists outside the confines of the movie.

Gerald Lambeau is a professor at MIT, and recognizes that Hunting has an exceptional mind, even though he's a janitor and not a student at the institution. Lambeau tries to get Hunting psychological help, while developing and exploiting his genius as a mathematician.

The final key element is romance. Hunting spots Skylar at a bar and manages to win her attention. His upbringing makes him a difficult romantic partner, but I won't ruin the story for you.

As I sat watching the movie, I found that I connected with it on several levels. The writing is superb, and thoroughly deserved the Oscar for best screenplay. The interactions between these very real characters was authentic and easy to imagine. Everything just fits together perfectly. I was reminded why drama is my favorite genre by far. This story is about something important. While few of us understand true genius, we can certainly identify with the problems and obstacles that life throws at us from time to time.

Imagine that you have a similar level of intelligence to that of Will Hunting. Perhaps you do? What would you choose to do with it? Is money your definition of success? If so, you would have numerous paths to pursue to reach that rather easy goal. Would you prefer to make a real difference in the world in your chosen field? Would you take a step back and figure out what truly makes you happy, even if it meant that your genius would be rarely utilized? Would you give it all up for the right romantic partner?

I like movies that reach me emotionally and make me think, and Good Will Hunting does all that and more. The script is insightful when you consider that it was written by two men in their mid-20s. Williams gives a memorable performance and Damon is right up there with him. Minnie Driver is believable as the interesting romantic interest, and the story is well-paced and intelligent. Good Will Hunting will appeal to anyone who enjoys drama, the psychological reasons that drive our choices, and human behavior in general.

87216,2,0788814664,"That is the only reason I can think of why he is not just the smartest mathemetician at MIT (including the professors) but one of the few greatest in all of world history.  This mathematical ability, combined with his built-in-wikiedia mind, fully loaded with verbatim, unabridged texts committed to memory.  He also is a kick-ass street fighter, and no slouch with the ladies.  Indeed, his girlfriend is not just beautiful.. she is from London, and she attends Harvard, and is bound to attend medical school - at Stanford!  How can someone with all of this talent be a janitor?  Easy. He's an alien.

This explains why he was an orphan.  Hatched from a space egg buried in the desert outside area 51.

This also explains the presence of Mork as his therapist.  They're from the same planet.",1409616000,7,791,4.7153284671532845
87217,2,0788814664,"After watching this movie I am stunned that it won so many awards and is on so many ""best of"" lists.  I don't even know where to begin listing the problems in this film.  One of the most severe problems is with characterization of Will Hunting - I could buy someone as a math prodigy from blue-collar roots who loves to hang with his buds, and if the movie had stopped there I might have enjoyed it more.  But this takes it many times farther than that - Hunting is also an expert at chemistry, psychology, biology, history - you name it he is an ""expert"" in the subject.  Also, he isn't just mathematically gifted, he is supernaturally endowed with mathematics acumen, being able to produce proofs that Fields Medal winners are unable to do while truthfully claiming it is ""so easy"" for him.  I know Hollywood likes to exaggerate skillsets, but this is insane: Even a math prodigy would have to study previous work for a long period of time to solve these problems.  But the real problem is that it is unclear how he practiced his skills and attained all this knowledge - even for a prodigy this would require some interest or enthusiasm for the subject, which he most certainly does not have. And of course he looks incredibly handsome, knows how to attract women, is funny, and more.

But ok, let's take a major leap of faith, suspend disbelief, and assume we somehow have this godlike individual walking the face of the earth.  Then it is mind-boggling that he sees just as much value in laying bricks for a living and in doing something that fully uses his talents.  This is a central theme in the movie, trying to justify his life choices, but it didn't convince me.  The movie seemed to think that the only reason he would use his talents would be to gain fame, fortune, and ""success"" for himself, which Hunting doesn't see as worthwhile.  Yet the movie never stops to consider that he could bring so much good to the world: a genius like his could cure cancer, end world hunger, etc. But no, I guess he is content to selfishly drink, party, and chase girls, without ever stopping to consider how he can best help the world around him.  Because of this I spent the movie hating Hunting's character.

So far I've been talking in very general terms so let's go into detail for a minute.  There is one scene in the movie where Hunting hands Prof. Lambeau a proof for a problem Lambeau has been working on without success.  Lambeau looks at the first page and immediately asks Hunting to explain why one line follows from the previous one.  Hunting scoffs, says he doesn't have time for this, and launches into a tirade about how he doesn't want to spend his life explaining stuff to stupid people.  There are two problems with this scene.  First, it makes Hunting an intensely unlikable character, he is too arrogant to share his knowledge with others, instead he wants to hoard it for himself.  This character flaw occurs over and over (such as not helping his girlfriend with her assignment, rather giving her the solution and asking her to come have fun with him) but is never examined or dealt with, causing Hunting to remain unlikeable throughout the movie.  The second (and more important) problem is that despite the movie's claims that Hunting is great at math, this scene shows that he is in fact a very poor mathematician.  Proving theorems is not about getting the right answer, it is about explaining why something is true in a rigorous way.  A good proof should be understandable by anyone with some expertise the the field, but difficult to generate.  It is not Lambeau's job to ""take it home"" to fill in that gaps as Hunting instructs him, it is Hunting's job and he failed at it.  It doesn't take a genius to create a proof where the interesting parts are left ""as an exercise to the reader"".  So this scene shows us that Hunting is a horrible mathematician, yet the movie continues to act as if he is a really good one, which is very confusing and shatters my suspension of disbelief.  I wonder if the screenwriters had any experience working in advanced math or if they were just throwing terms around.

I've ranted enough so I won't go into the total lack of chemistry between Hunting and his girlfriend, or the horrible pacing of the film, nor the lack of even a hint to the resolution of the film's central dilemma (what will Hunting do with his talent?).

The only good part was Robin Williams' amazing acting, which is why I gave it two stars. If only he had been the star instead of a supporting character.  I can't believe I wasted $11 and two hours of my time watching this.",1409616000,3,4604,4.5332527206771465

87336,5,0788814664,"I'm stunned at how good this 1997 starter movie for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck looks on this 2012 American Miramax/Lionsgate BLU RAY (which is now cheap as chip). It's beautifully clean and a revelation after all these years of so-so DVDs.

There's barely a hair on any scene - no glitches - no wobbles - the colour is beautiful - and as it's defaulted to 'Widescreen' so it fills the entire screen naturally (without bars top or bottom). There's English and German 5.1 DTS-HD Audio, French 5.1 Dolby Digital with English, English SDH - and English, Spanish, French and German subtitles.

It's also REGION A and 'B' - which means the States, the 'UK and Europe'. So British and European film fans can buy this great movie with confidence that it won't give them compatibility issues.

You also forget how good a film ""Good Will Hunting"" is and was (9 nominations) - a really great script by the boys full of life observations from the real Boston (won for best original screenplay), Stellan Skarsgard as the snotty obsessed Maths teacher and Robin Williams as the hurt but earthy shrink (both shining like diamonds - especially Williams who is a wow and rightly won his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor) and the lovely Minnie Driver with such a lightness of touch. Younger brother Casey Affleck as one of the boys while Matt and Ben took the world by storm - so brilliant for such a young age.

87368,3,0788814664,"I don't usually talk like that; I'm just poking fun at the characters in the film. If you find that blurb offensive you'd better skip this movie.

""Good Will Hunting"" (1997) tells the story of a young genius, Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who comes from a tough neighborhood in South Boston and works as a janitor at MIT. A Math professor, Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgrd), posts a difficult problem on the board and is amazed to discover that Will solves it. Will gets in trouble with the law but Lambeau gives succor and enlists the help of psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to get him on the right path. Meanwhile Will is falling for a Harvard girl (Minnie Driver).

The plot of a genius janitor is great and I thought I'd like the film more than I did, but a couple of things really bog it down.

For one, Will Hunting is not a ""good"" person, as the title suggests (I'm sure they were being ironic). In fact, he's so smart he's stupid. Doesn't he know that smoking will destroy his body and send him to an early grave? But that's the least of Will's shortcomings. He's arrogant and unnecessarily mean. For instance, Professor Lambeau visits him in jail and Will's first words are, ""What the f*** do you want?"" Could anyone be that stupid? How about, ""Hi, I'm Will. Who are you, Sir?"" I get it -- he's from a tough neighborhood and was abused as a kid, but 99% of guys from tough neighborhoods who were abused as kids don't talk unnecessary sheet like Will does in this film.

In fact, too much of the cussing rings untrue. Will and his three friends from South Boston (including Ben Affleck) use the f-word practically every other word and it strikes an inauthentic chord. Yes, I get it -- they're trying to act like hooligans from a rough neighborhood -- but they try too hard and it comes off contrived.

I should add that I hail from a hooligan-oriented neighborhood where the gang cussed, drank & smoked like sailors, but even we could construe eight words together without throwing in the f-word. I have no problem with realistic cussing in films; in fact, I prefer it. But when it's so over-the-top that it seems artificial it detracts from the drama.

Furthermore, Damon doesn't LOOK like a tough guy from the wrong side of the tracks (neither does Ben, but he's a little better). Matt's miscast because he just looks too soft with his baby-face. I think he knew this because he tries too hard to be a tough punk, and it shows.

The fact that the main protagonist is thoroughly unlikable takes away from the story. Who cares about some disrespectful punk who doesn't care to better himself, genius or not? As a result, the drama isn't nearly as compelling as it could've been. When Sean (Williams) finally gets Will to break at the end, I wasn't much interested.

Still, if you can handle the trying-too-hard-to-appear-tough acting and dialog, ""Good Will Hunting"" is worth catching if you like dramas. For one, Robin Williams is great in an atypical role as a serious psycho-therapist who is able to handle Will and overcome his (genius) defense mechanisms. Skarsgrd is also excellent. And please don't take my criticisms the wrong way because there IS some good drama in this film, but it's buried underneath contrived writing and the corresponding performances (mainly Matt and Ben).

Incidentally, Minnie and Matt hooked up after this movie, so the romantic sparks are real.

The film runs 126 minutes and was shot on location in Massachusetts and Toronto.

It is a heart warming movie that shows different sides of men and how everyone has a different motivation for life.

This is a great movie for the family, someone having trouble moving through life or just dealing with personal issues. It could also serve as a great Men's Bible Study of how, eventually you have to deal with the issues of life.",1378166400,,689,4.468253968253968

87379,5,0788814664,"As you can probably guess, Robin Williams's performance as Matt Daman's therapist is my personal highlight of this great film.  Well, you'd be right about that.  But Robin Williams's performance is merely the top of my list.  Few people know that the original script for this film focused on a math genius going to work for the government.  Well, some brilliant Hollywood type told Matt Daman and Ben Affleck to rework the story so that it focuses on the character of Will Hunting and his life in South Boston...""brilliant"" is an understatement.  This idea is what made this movie great.  No, if there had been just a little less swearing (maybe skip a sentence or so when you spew out that stuff during the conversations) and I'd give it a perfect score...right now, it's a 4.9.  But despite the constant foul-mouthed attitudes, I give it two thumbs up and it makes my Top 10 list at #4.  So, go out and get it and enjoy it over and over again.

The reason is because all he does is WORK and STUDY.  He has a natural ability to learn.  It is so motivational that it makes you want to study something and learn something.

I  was drawn into story again that I didn't even feel the minutes going by on my exercise (sometimes a problem).  I enjyed Matt Damon and Robin Williams especially. They list Ben affleck as lead in the credits but he was OK and the other two stars I mentioned along with Minnie Driver gave far better performances and surprised that Amazon singled out Ben for mention on the only credit listed!  Great film supposed to be in Boston and on MIT campus. I think I read in credits that a lot of it was actually filmed in Canada.

But Will has a dark, well concealed past and it inhibits his ability to fulfill his potential without professional help. Enter Robin Williams as the psychiatrist (and former classmate of the professor), whose tough but sensitive demeanor is just the combination needed to get into the mind of a vulnerable boy who can no longer hide his anger or his pain.

87508,5,0788814664,"There are so many things that just went so right about this movie: The great screenplay written by the film's stars Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, the recruitment of Gus van Sant as the film's director, and most of all Robin Williams in a role that one him the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. It's a near pitch-perfect film about believing in yourself and forgiving yourself.

What's so great about this movie is that it ignores a lot of the conventions of American filmmaking at the time and focuses more on its characters, who are more introspective and thoughtful than they initially appear, in particular Affleck's Chucky, who's friendship with the title character is both loyal and unquestionable. What's also so wonderful about this film is that it isn't afraid to go where most movies don't, often having its characters say and do things that we all think yet don't act on. It's the smallest details that make this film so much fun to watch.

The DVD itself is a great package, with feature length commentaries with the cast and crew, including director Gus van Sant and writer/stars Affleck and Damon (who won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for the film's script). The picture is focused and crisp, and does a great job of representing the beautiful cinematography of the van Sant's film.

Overall, a great package suitable for an incredible and inspiring film. Enjoy!",1371513600,,1400,4.825

87533,5,0788814664,"I saw this movie on DVD last month and I must say that I was taken by this warm-hearted picture. It is the film that established Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as the mega stars they would one day become.

Damon plays Will Hunting, a blue collar kid who was an orphan. He came up hard in Boston and has to struggle to make it in life. He only has his friends and when they get in a scrape with local Italian-American toughs, he finds himself in prison for beating up a cop. A local professor sees Hunting's potential and intercedes with the judge who grudgingly allows for Hunting's parole. However, in order for Hunting to get that parole he must meet with a shrink for therapy. That is where Robin William's character comes in. This was his Oscar winning role.

I won't go into any more detail on the plot suffice it to say that this is a picture everyone in the family can and will enjoy. I loved the DVD extras too. Get this dVD and you won't be disappointed. I have made the 349th Five-Star review and it is the 536th overall.

87552,5,0788814664,"Yes, GOOD WILL HUNTING is a beloved film very much ingrained in our cinematic lexicon.  And yes, GOOD WILL HUNTING made Matt Damon and Ben Affleck instant mega-stars (and a much-deserved Oscar for best original screenplay).  And finally, we all know the basic story of GOOD WILL HUNTING:  A Boston bad boy who happens to be a closet genius finally accepts his problematic self only after a series of intense sessions with a damaged therapist who's been through his own inner hell.  Yet as familiar as I am with this incredible movie, I always look forward to watching it again; when you see such a superbly acted, beautifully crafted film (kudos to director Gus Van Sant) that touches so many core emotions as GOOD WILL HUNTING, you can never watch such a film enough.

What a cast.  Damon.  Affleck.  Minnie Driver.  Ben's kid brother Casey.  Stellan Skarsgard as the MIT prof who (tries) to mentor young Will Hunting.  Cole Hauser (who rounds out the gang of four Boston rowdies).  And Robin Williams (another much-deserved Oscar).  Playing therapist Sean Maguire, a burned out junior college professor who is Will's last resort to obtain therapy and avoid jail, Williams gives the performance of his career, in my humble opine.  (He's also one hairy beast, but I digress.)  We're used to seeing Williams as an ADD madcap bouncing out of control, but here we see the constant pain of a man in his own turmoil as Williams portrays a very damaged Maguire who has the instinct and recognition to touch the right buttons that finally draw Will out of his facade and talk about what's been a most difficult, painful life.  The ""breakthrough"" moment is spellbinding, culminating in Will's final decision about what to do with his life that will leave a warm smile on your face.  Yes, we're all familiar with the story, yet GOOD WILL HUNTING is so good it deserves to be savored, over and over.

Personally, I have nothing against swearing in films, except when it becomes a distraction, as it does here.  When I start thinking things like ""Can't these people say a single sentence without the F-word,"" or ""Who the heck wrote this stupid script,"" then the magic of the movie experience is lost on me.

I personally enjoy the movie from start to finish because of the storyline, the good acting by Damon, and Williams.  The supporting cast added to the emtions of the film and characters, but even as smart of the charcter Damon did for the movie, the character realize and learned even in life you don't know everything and there are things worth going after, and he choose to go after the woman he loves but was afraid to say it to her.  Though in life it doesn't matter how smart you are, what job you have, how much money you make, almost all of us would give it all up for that one chance at love.

87586,4,0788814664,"This movie has been around for a long time, but I've always wanted to own it because it's one I can watch several times a year. Like ""Little Man Tate"", it's about a highly gifted young man who needs access to resources that  challenge and inspire him and guidance in making good decisions on how to best use those resources. This film combines harsh reality with a slight essence of fairy tale. What amazes me most about the film is that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote the screenplay in addition to acting in the film. It is also one of Robin Williams' best serious roles, as impressive as his performance in ""Awakenings.""  As a native of the Boston area, I can assure the viewers that the South Boston accents are genuine, not surprising since Damon and Affleck both grew up in South Boston. The only reason I gave the film 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is highly unlikely that the serious issues in the main character's life could ever be resolved as neatly as the film portrays. But one must wrap up a story somehow, and the ending is satisfying. This is a classic film, nominated for several Academy Awards and winning Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (for Williams).",1353801600,2,1193,4.544186046511628

87604,4,0788814664,"Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, a decidedly unambitious South Boston youngster. He works as a janitor at MIT, and when a math professor puts a major brain-buster math problem on the blackboard outside his classroom, Will supplies the answer anonymously. Nobody in the professor's classroom claims credit for it, so he puts another one on the board and Will solves that one, too. But this time the professor catches him at it.

Turns out Will has a long juvenile delinquency record, and is only on that job because his probation officer got it for him. The professor tracks him down and manages to get him released in exchange for two promises: he will do some high-level math work with the professor, and he will see a therapist. After several false starts, the professor's old friend Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) undertakes to be Will's therapist. That's what most of the story is about.

Will is a genuine genius, but he tends to see it as more of a burden than a blessing. He is completely self-educated by hanging out in the public library, and apparently has a nearly photographic memory. He's also very awkward with women, hangs out with some very (ahem) working class losers, and seems to have no more ambition than outsmarting anyone who would pin him down. My own diagnosis for him is Asperger's syndrome. But then that's also my own unprofessional diagnosis of myself. And after all, he does have the terrific face and body of Matt Damon.

Good movie. Really, very good. Why not five stars? Because I grew very tired of the beer in the local bar scenes and his loser friends.",1336694400,2,1585,4.714801444043322

I needed it with subtitles.
Now this Blu-ray version comes with many nice features, including subtitles. Unfortunately they're only for the movie, not for the special features. There are some nice extras, including the audio commentary and deleted scenes. I would have loved to see even more extras, but it's Ok.  On the good side, the image is crisp and clean.

87610,5,0788814664,"There are so few movies, in my opinion, that deserve Academy Award nominations.  Good Will Hunting is certainly one that deserved all 9 nominations.  Yes, all NINE of them.  Why?  Well, if you haven't seen the film, it was a combination of superb writing, top notch acting, and a story line that took you on Will's journey.

A great engaging story, like this one, gets you engaged, helps develop an attachment to the protagonist, and inserts you as a caring observer of the story.  I can say that at moments during the film you can laugh as heartily as Will's friends in the bar, or share your tears of pain from Will's unfortunate past.  This is what films should do, encourage an emotional response, and this one surely delivers.

Bottom line here is that if you haven't seen it, you should.

12/06: No doubt, Good Will Hunting is a brilliantly made film.

Because of his experience directing juvenile delinquent films such as Drugstore Cowboy and My Own Private Idaho, Gus Van Sant is the perfect choice for Good Will Hunting.

In the past, he tried to make the best movie possible to represent the genre, and he finally gets it right with Good Will Hunting.

Matt Damon and Ben Affleck turn in the best performances of their overrated careers, and it's maybe the best they will have ever done because they believed in the story and put everything into it.

Robin Williams proves once again that he is one of the best drama actors in the business and deserves the Oscar. Stellan Skarsgrd is also very good. Minnie Driver is okay.

I have lived through the experiences of Will Hunting and understand his character completely. Psychologically, many of the emotions are right on the mark. The dialogues are an accurate representation of who the characters are.

All in all, Good Will Hunting is one of my favorite pictures.

2/12: When I saw Good Will Hunting the first time, I felt like I was seeing myself in it.

Since then, I have seen the movie repeatedly, and it still has withstood the test of time.

87618,5,0788814664,"Good Will Hunting is my #1 favorite movie.  I have seen it 20+ times over the years.  The trailer and ""back of the box"" describe what the story is about on the surface, but the real genius of the film, that most people miss, is how it dares you to define what comes naturally to you.  What you can do with absolutely no effort.  A simple yet profoundly difficult question.  This film actually helped me answer it.

MY FAVORITE SCENE & WHY:  The entire point of this movie is encapsulated in the outdoor cafe scene, where Will and Skyler are having coffee while she is trying to study for her Organic Chemistry class.  Will wants to ""hurry up"" and give her the answers so they can run off and have some fun, and she tries to explain to him that it is important that she learn it on her own.  A Harvard student herself, she is mesmerized (and rightfully so) by Will's genuis and cannot understand how he knows everything that he knows without a formal education. This leads her to ask him (oh so gently) how his brain actually works.  The only thing more beautiful than her question is his answer.  If for no other reason, watch this movie to find out EXACTLY what he says.

TOP TAKE AWAY:  Some quiet day ask yourself, ""What is it that I can just play?""  Whatever that is...go do it.",1324598400,5,1282,4.331932773109243

87636,5,0788814664,"Begin with the name ""Good Will Hunting"" and you find there are a number of ways it can be unpacked, producing different meaning--all of which can describe the plot of this movie from a different angle. There is certainly ""hunting"" taking place. Matt Damon does the hunting as: Will Hunting. He's the genius who cannot be genius because his inner world needs more basic and primitive securities than this before that aspect of his life can be put into perspective. He therefore remains with what he sees as the ""safe life"" of janitor (at MIT), beer-swiller, and thug--a step from prison--which feed off this inner-storm of rage left to him from childhood. Robin Williams (the psychoanalyst), Ben Affleck (his South Boston best friend) and Minnie Driver (true love--sorely needed & found) each do their part in participating ""in the hunt!""

We must start with the given: that we are all looking for happiness. Many times, we are looking in all the wrong places. The condition and struggle we see in Will is something I have not seen described better, and more concisely, than Thomas Keating in his work,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Human-Condition-Contemplation-and-Transformation-Wit-Lectures-Harvard-Divinity-School/dp/0809138824/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Human Condition: Contemplation and Transformation (Wit Lectures-Harvard Divinity School)</a>, excerpted below from pp. 13-14. In these days of sweeping dysfunction in families, this is not uncommon, nor is it hard to recognize:

""All of us have been through the process of being born and entering this world with three essential biological needs: security and survival, power and control, affection and esteem. ...these three instinctual needs are all we have with which to build a program for happiness. ... As a result, any object entering into our universe--another person or event--is judged on the basis of whether it can provide us with what we believe or demand happiness to be.

""Children who are deprived of security, affection, and control needs develop a desperate drive to find more and more symbols of these basic human needs in their culture. This is called compensation. It can also happen that when experiences in early childhood are unbearable, they are repressed into the unconscious. The body seems to be a kind of warehouse in which all our experiences--the whole of our lives--are recorded....

""Here, then, is the beginning of what might be called the addictive process, the need to hide the pain that we suffered in early life and cannot face. We repress it into the unconscious to provide an apparent freedom from the pain or develop compensatory processes to access forms of pleasure that offset the pain we are not yet prepared to face. We are thrust because of circumstances into the position of developing a homemade self that does not conform to reality. Everything entering into the world that makes survival and security, affection and esteem, and power and control our chief pursuits of happiness has to be judged on the basis of one question: Is it good for me? Hence, good and evil are judged not by their objective reality, but by the way we perceive them as fitting into our private universe or not.""

We must be able to comprehend Will's universe, how it got constructed, and why. What keeps this universe together, working, and why? If unrecognizable, try to grasp Keating's sketch above as something incredibly real that paralyzes the lives of countless individuals. To see this come alive in a screenplay is quite remarkable. No doubt, Gus Van Sant must be given the credit for his directing the incredible performances we see by the cast. Sit and enter into the anguish and the difficulty facing Will at each step towards discovery and healing. It might take several viewings to achieve the full impact.

Lastly, I really hate vulgarity in movies. I find it rarely adds anything. Contrariwise, although the language and some situations may strike as being too offensive, I think in this case, it's a real part of the movie. Bear with it and you will not regret it. See it as part of that for which Will is hunting. Of course, parental discretion is strongly advised and takes precedence over any recommendation of mine.",1287964800,2,4272,5.2020348837209305
87637,2,0788814664,"This movie is okay to watch the first time around--but too annoying to watch a second time--or to even reflect on it afterwords.  Anybody who has even the vaguest understanding of what it means to do original work involving higher mathematics will find this film ridiculous.  Yeah, some people are indeed brilliant, but they apply their brilliance to incredibly difficult problems that had frustrated other brilliant minds before them.  Einstein had to let all other duties and family responsibilities slide while developing general relativity.  Brilliant and ground-breaking theoretical work is hardly possible as a part time hobby.  Nor do professors at big name schools like MIT fawn over the work of even their most brilliant graduate students or post-docs--let alone the facile scribbles of self-educated janitors.",1287532800,3,819,5.468253968253968
87638,4,0788814664,"I saw this film over thirteen years ago and it took me this long to write a review. Maybe Robin Williams' character could analyze that. Anyway, upon re-watching the film, I still think it is good. Matt Damon does an outstanding job, as do Robin Williams, Stellan Skarsgard, Ben Affleck and Minnie Driver.

The film presents the classic troubled protagonist. Trust me, I've been there, so I appreciate Damon's character. I think the scene near the end of the film where Affleck finally challenges Damon to use his genius it great. Finally, his own brethren lay it on the line, and Damon finally realizes his potential. That's what it's all about.

My only complaint is the slightly political undercurrent which lurks throughout the film. The scene where Damon rebuffs the NSA is especially irritating, as though the NSA is just a bunch of mathematicians seeking to screw over African villagers. Trust me, it goes far deeper than that. You all sleep comfortably at night thanks in no small part to the NSA. So unprokovoked attacks on the NSA rub me the wrong way.

That aside, the film is still quite good. It is deep, meaningful and attempts to make a statement on our society. For that I give it credit, and I say it is an excellent film.",1285027200,3,1238,4.669724770642202
87639,3,0788814664,"In Good Will Hunting (the 1997 movie starring Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Robin Williams) we see a juxtaposition of the academic and institutionally revered with 'street-level' forms of the trivial and repulsive. Maths discussions filled with heavy-weight theories and formulae share center-stage with sleazy sex conversations and crap-talk of the most juvenile level.

This reaches a zenith at a Harvard bar when Will Hunting's (the genius abused and abandoned by his parents who's also the pro-an-tagonist of the show, played well by then first-timer Matt Damon) friend, Chuckie (played to perfection by a then similarly unknown Ben Affleck), tried to pass himself off as a Harvard student to chat up girls but got into trouble when a real Harvard boy challenged him. At the very moment when Chuckie would've had to slink away in intellectual humiliation, Will comes in and stunningly blows the other guy away with his page-precise citations of American history, exposing his opponent as a plagiarist who had a long way to go in terms of academic robustness. Will, of course, can't resist slamming the entire American college education system when he mocked the Harvard student for having ""dropped a 150 grand on an education which he could've gotten for 1.50 in late-charges at the public library.""

And that's the turning point in the movie. It's not just the place where ""street"" meets ""smart"", it's also where Will meets Skylar, his future girlfriend whose love yet frailty and very human demands force Will to either radically reconsider (with the help of his psychologist, Sean, sensitively portrayed by crazyman Robin Williams) his whole I-don't-give-a-damn philosophy or lose the one person who loves him and desperately wants him to love her.

Assuming the movie isn't just about the personal redemption of an orphan who also happens to be a genius, what else is it about? Is the film showing us the kinds of worlds we live in, one reflective of society's best values, another nonsensical and ultimately self-destructive? Or are we being presented with two kinds of serious? Or does the movie claim that human betterment can only be achieved via an immersion in and familiarity with the 'scum' and dregs of society?

This last theme - that the mind-blindingly brilliant is often not only indistinguishable from the unhygienically banal but often requires it - has many expressions in the movie. E.g. Will's counselor, Sean, came from a rough neighbourhood and was the only one who could 'reach' Will, with at least three other 'academic' types failing miserably; Gerry, the Maths professor looking for Will, couldn't find him without the help of two janitors; Sean talks about how Will's friends, despite their socio-economic situation, has unflinching loyalty for Will, implying that this virtue is somehow alien to the likes of Gerry; Part of Sean's brilliant monologue to Will in the park includes explaining how the simple act of sitting next to a dying wife makes the difference between knowing about love and knowing what love truly is i.e. Sean's being there trumps all the books Will has and will ever read.

The title of the movie itself, 'Good Will Hunting', gives us a paradox in the form of a question, ""What's so good about Will?"" His intellect, whilst undeniably supreme, has served not much use apart from giving him an edge in assault-and-battery cases (in which he defends himself by using cases over a hundred years old). All his reading and arguments have entrenched him even deeper in his social defiance, deep yet hidden self-pity and more than occasional explosions of violence. One could even say that because he was so smart, he could never fail to see why he didn't have to change his life. A critical point of the movie is when Chuckie, completely against expectations, rebukes Will for wasting his talent. Chuckie, despite being far less gifted than Will, profoundly recognises his limits and because of that chides Will for NOT seeing how he has no limits, and how his continued refusal to seek out success represents an insult to people like Chuckie.

Of course, one could also see the title 'Good Will Hunting' as the search for goodwill in people's lives and our own. This not only exemplifies Will's (unacknowledged?) quest in the movie, it also points out the surprising places and persons where goodwill can be found: in a grieving psychologist, in foul-mouthed dirt-poor friends and from students nowhere near one's intellectual standards but who love with aching passion.

In a word, 'good' was bad, and the 'bad' contains much which can be called good and if we can't see that, then too bad.",1275436800,3,4639,5.009079118028534
87640,5,0788814664,"I love this movie--have watched it several times. Great performances by all. My favorite scene is in the college bar where Will puts a cocky, know-it-all-wannabe student in his place. Robin Williams does indeed deliver an Oscar-winning performance. Until recently I couldn't figure out why Will never applied himself in school and go on to college and all, since he's so obviously interested in learning, studying in his spare time as a hobby. Another reviewer wisely pointed out after reading my old review of this flick that Will never outwardly pursued academics because he probably was afraid of being alienated by his circle of friends, none of whom were gifted at all like he was. Since he had a terrible childhood, this circle of friends was certainly the only source of ""belonging"" that he had in his life, hence his doing all of his studying in secret.

87642,1,0788814664,"The reliance on technical subject matter in order to create an air of whimsy or intrigue feels a bit synthetic to me. The psychological aspect of the movie seemed to be too weak to stand alone, and required a supplement of fantasy. The fantastic aspects were not particularly well crafted, and felt a bit clunky at times. In some ways it seems that the psychological core of the piece is co-opted by the requirement of suspension of disbelief in the sense that by incorporating the abilities of Will the writers seek to enhance the effect of the psychological encounters by disarming the viewer. It is fairly obvious to me (though maybe I'm just a nut case) that they build Will up as an exceptional character and then show him to be human in a fairly cliche way, while dodging any real psychological insight.

Another minor point, which I see has been brought up here before: They clearly did not try to carefully integrate the actualities of the sort of environments (academic or otherwise) that Will finds himself interacting with. It seems painfully obvious that the writers were not genuinely grounded in what they were attempting to show.

 Considering that in theory I have to put this movie up to the test against those of Kurosawa, Fellini, Bergman, and any of the other great expositors of the human condition (arguably including Dostoevsky, Sartre and Camus and other writers at least as far as the adeptness of the writers to expose the human condition); as a psychological drama it seems to fall flat.

87656,5,0788814664,"Matt Damon and Ben Affleck won an Oscar for Best Screenplay, and Robin Williams won another for Best Supporting Actor, for ""Good Will Hunting,"" and if you watch this film, it's really not hard to see why.

Damon plays Will Hunting, a gifted but troubled young man who's worked many a low-wage job and been in one too many scrapes with the Boston Police.  Affleck plays his best friend, Chuck, an average working joe who, along with two other friends, accompanies Will in all his (mis)adventures in life.  Their Boston accents are absolutely flawless in this film.  Will, working as a janitor at MIT, spots an incredibly difficult problem on a blackboard outside one of the lecture halls and solves it inside of a minute without breaking a sweat--he's a genius, possibly a super-genius, and we see him able to match wits even with arrogant Harvard students (as in one very amusing scene in a Cambridge bar/Harvard hangout spot) quite easily.  He is spotted by Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stelland Skaarsgard), who agrees to bail Will out of jail after his most recent scrape with the law if he'll 1) work with the professor on solving some very difficult math problems and 2) see a psychiatrist to work out his problems.

Will, who grew up an orphan in and out of various foster homes, often being horribly abused, has developed a tough outer shell that makes him push everyone away who tries to get too close--he tears down each of the professor's suggested shrinks until Lambeau matches him up with Sean Kelly (Robin Williams, in the best piece of acting he's ever done), who turns out to be, in many ways, Will's soul-brother (another Southie native who had a hard childhood).  He even keeps Schuyler (Minnie Driver), his girlfriend, at a distance with a tall tale about his 12 Irish Catholic brothers, even though it's clear he's quite fond of her, and she's in love with him.

The story that unfolds, while it may be somewhat cliche, is also one we can all easily recognise, having some element of our lives--the climactic scene, in which Sean finally breaks through to Will by gently reminding him that all the trouble that's befallen him in his life is not his fault never fails to get me choked up and teary-eyed.  Will's story is that of a misunderstood soul trying to get through life the only way he knows how--the hard way.  It takes a kindred spirit to get him to see that it doesn't have to be like that, and that he can do much better for himself.  Even his blue-collar friends, none of whom has more than middling prospects in life, know he's special and want to see him succeed.

It's a great movie, and if you have a soft spot for Boston, you'll have another reason to enjoy this gem.  Definitely recommended.",1228176000,3,2724,4.638253638253638

87660,3,0788814664,"Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is an MIT janitor and mathematical genius with major attachment and abuse reactive disorders (though the film doesn't identify the latter). After Will solves an ""impossible"" math problem Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) chalked on the board outside his classroom, the goodly pedant attends Hunting's latest arraignment for fighting, and convinces a skeptical judge that he can salvage the boy's otherwise futile life.

After false starts with several ""master"" psychologists whom Hunting easily outwits, Lambeau approaches Sean McGuire (Robin Williams). Lambeau figures, who better to help the boy than his eclectic former college roommate, like Hunting a tough-skinned ""Southie"" (South Boston native)?

Thus begins Hunting's frequent forays into Cambridge to ""study"" with Lambeau and his mathematical colleagues, whom he usually humiliates by solving their toughest problems in the blink of an eye.

In one clever scene, Hunting takes his best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck) and two other Southie sidekicks to a Cambridge bar. Chuckie tries to impress Harvard student Skylar (Minnie Driver). A self-satisfied graduate student prig interrupts, and tries embarrassing Chuck to captivate Skylar. That backfires when Hunting steps in. He has also apparently read and memorized every book ever written. The prig slinks away in shame. As Hunting and friends depart, Skylar approaches and hands him her number.

As another reviewer notes, Good Will Hunting is good and original--but where good, is not original and where original, is not good. I'd agree that the film nicely portrays lower class Boston Irish life, and the strange match between a high class orphan (and upper-class) Harvard woman and a brilliant street tough, whose early life was marred by constant physical abuse. The acting in general is very strong, with Robin Williams (as always) at the head of the class.

But the Matt Damon and Ben Affleck screenplay, while often fine and riveting, is also at times completely nave. As young actors, before this film gave them their first break, Damon and Affleck bought into ahistorical propaganda and never let go. Thus in one session with McGuire, Hunting again spews forth his mastery of great literature and science, but like an otherwise unread cultist ranks Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky with Shakespeare. Utterly ballsy---and too stupid.

If the math is inaccurate, so what. That's not a key point of this film.

But it is extremely unfortunate that the movie portrays a sudden breakthrough when Hunting finally gets down to talking to McGuire about the serial beatings he suffered as a child. Everyone even slightly familiar with psychological therapy knows this is genuinely incredible (as in not believable). Genius or not, no patient who experienced such major early life traumas could achieve such complete healing after only a few months of counseling. This might make pleasant fiction. But given the seriousness of the film's central theme, it dangerously suggests the impossible is possible and could give some viewers false hope.

87661,5,0788814664,"Where do you start with such a wonderfully crafted story with an amazing cast.

A janitor (Matt Damon) at a college is discovered to be mathematically gifted by a highly acclaimed mathmetician at the college and is pressed to use his talent.

But Matt fights the approach because he's afraid of the unknown and doesn't want to leave his comfort zone of his friends, and unchallenging job. After fighting and kicking he finally gives in and slowly begins to break down his walls to experience the gift he has never used.

No one could have been better than Matt Damon. He takes the role on as if he truly was the character who was brought up in abusive foster homes and has built walls around his insecurities.

 I loved to watch him. I believed him. And Minnie Driver as his girlfriend is captivating.

It's refreshing to see the very talented Robin Williams in a more serious role.",1216944000,,882,4.585987261146497
87662,4,0788814664,"There is an air of clich&eacute;d familiarity that runs through the veins of `Good Will Hunting', but that familiarity never reaches a point of exhaustion.  What I mean to say is that there is enough going for the film that makes up for the lack of original (or even at times `realistic') spark.  The plot is formulistic.  You have a poor orphan who grew up in a rough neighborhood and never committed himself to education, yet he works as a janitor for a prestigious college so that he can listen and learn and when his impressive math IQ is discovered he is immediately pulled at from all angles in a struggle to dominate his genius.  What takes this script to another level though are the marvelous performances that embody the film.  I was really taken aback by everyone in the cast; the emotion and dedication and attention they gave to the spirit and soul of their characters.

To me, this film is above all else an acting showcase and I will review it as such.

First of all we have Matt Damon.  For a long time I considered Matt to be just another pretty face; an actor who was there because of his chiseled abs and his charming demeanor, but then I saw `The Talented Mr. Ripley' and I realized that this guy is a very talented actor.  Matt has proven again and again that he deserves his garnered fame.  This performance was probably the first real confirmation of his talent.  First of all he co-wrote the script; but that is not is forte.  The script, like I mentioned, is formulistic and clich&eacute;d and really is the weakest facet of the finished product.  Damon's performance on the other hand is one of the strongest.  As Will he really fleshes himself out to the audience.  We see the breakdown of his soul and understand who he is on the inside; the man he is striving to become, fighting to become, but most importantly we see the parts of himself he is afraid he'll lose.  This is such a marvelous performance, one that is truly deserving of the praise and accolades it garnered (bravo to the Oscar nomination) and one that you truly won't forget.

Next we have Robin Williams.  I love Robin.  I think that he is one of our greatest comedians working today and he never fails to attack my funny bone.  As a serious actor he is hit or miss with me.  I loved his calm and restrained insanity demonstrated in `One Hour Photo' and `Insomnia'.  On the other hand I loathed the failed attempt at the same he exhibited in `The Final Cut'.  I thought that he was dull and boring in `The Dead Poets Society' yet loved his comforting tone in `Awakenings' (albeit he stood no chance against the force that was DeNiro).  Here I am pleased yet not overwhelmed.  I thought that Williams' performance was touching and sincere, yet it is not outstanding, thus I feel that his Oscar win was a bit of a stretch (personally I felt both Kinnear & Reynolds were more deserving).  As Doctor Sean Maguire he does what he can to make his clich&eacute;d character real and understandable, and there are moments where he really grabs me (one such moment is his adlibbed spiel about his wife's flatulence which I found hilarious yet emotionally resonant to his characters warmth) yet his performance to me is not nearly as memorable as those provided by the remaining cast members.

Which brings me to Ben Affleck.  I am not one who believes Affleck is a good actor.  I enjoyed him in a few things, very few things, but here he really reached me.  His character was so natural and believable and even moving.  Maybe that's because he wrote the character for himself, I don't know, but he really nailed this one.  Throughout the film his character takes a backseat to Damon, but he never allows himself to drift into the background completely, and there are moments where he really steals the limelight and shines the brightest.  One scene in particular comes near the end of the film, when he character Chuckie is having his `heart to heart' with Will.  Affleck expresses so much emotional depth here, so much natural and heartfelt warmth and understanding that it serves as one of the most fundamental scenes in the film.  Affleck may never be this good again, but at least he was this good once.

Now I am a huge fan of Stellan Skarsgard.  I just love the majority of his work.  His performances in the films of Lars von Treir are what initially grabbed me (I just adored his devilish qualities in both `Dogville' and `Breaking the Waves') but time and time again he manages to grip me completely.  Here is no exception.  Skarsgard (who just has the coolest name) has a very limited role as Professor Gerald Lambeau, but his presence is felt throughout the film.  His misplaced arrogance and false sense of concern is prominent and effective and is displayed on the faces of all who come in contact with him.  I just love his methods of delivery and am always compelled to adore him even when his character isn't deserving of adoration (which is more often than not).

I'll make a quick note before moving forward that both Casey Affleck and Cole Hauser are effective in their small roles as friends of Will and Chuckie.  Both actors have little to do but both actors have shaped decent careers for themselves since; most notably Affleck who garnered an Oscar nomination last year for his riveting performance as the cowardly killer of one Jesse James.  I have mentioned before that I think Cole Hauser is a better actor than his poor film choices allow, so I'll just leave it at that.  Give him a decent movie already.

So the last actor (or should I say actress) that I want to discuss here is Minnie Driver.  Her performance, for me at least, is best in show.  I will say first and foremost that I adore Minnie Driver.  I think that she is an extremely talented actress who just soars in both charm and beauty and charisma and natural grace.  Here is no exception.  As Skylar, Will's love interest, she is a dynamic force, a joyous and lovable portrayal of honest emotion.  I love the way that her character feels real; just watching her interact with Will in childish ways add layers of believability to her character.  She is relatable.  Her final scene with Will breaks my heart into a million pieces every time I see it.  She moves me to action and I think that's why I just can't help but laud this performance above all else in the film.

""I love you Skylar.""

Every time I watch this movie, especially during that climatic scene, I am compelled to utter those words aloud.

""I love you Skylar.""

So there you have it; my thoughts on the movie that is `Good Will Hunting'.  As a film itself (that is script wise) it is nothing spectacular, but the many moving performances make this a must see film.  I can somewhat agree with the sentiments that this is an overrated film for it is not as impressive as many films released that same year, but acting wise it is close to the front of the pack (it's hard because 1997 also brought us `L.A. Confidential' which sports some of the best performances of the year as well).  I'll watch this movie again and again just for the brilliance that is Minnie Driver (not to mention Damon) and I'm sure that even if you don't `adore' this film you will find the satisfaction needed within in order for you to justify multiple watches.  One cannot forsake the importance of a solid director, and while Gus Van Sant is somewhat hit or miss with me his direction here is a definite hit, for he drew from his actors exactly what was needed in order to make a simple script shine through its muddled clich&eacute;s.",1212105600,3,7552,4.535107169253511

87665,2,0788814664,"Honestly, what was good about him?  Not to make an issue on the title, but Hunting was far from an honest citizen.  Genius?  Yes.  Honest citizen?  No.

I'm surprised this movie is rated so high by film critics and by viewers nationwide despite the amount of holes this movie has in its story.  Not to mention lackluster performances by some of its main characters and the overall story's believability.

So we're presented with Will Hunting who is the cleanest cut dropout reject to ever step foot on the streets of Boston I have ever seen.  Umm yeah right.  The hole with Hunting's character is the obvious lack of his childhood background throughout the movie.  He's a genius, but he's had a tough childhood.  There are rarely any references to his childhood and certainly no flashbacks to help the viewer understand him a little better as the movie goes on.  What happened to him?  How did he become a genius?  Robin Williams does a great job of ""guessing"" what happened to Will, but how about going into depth?  Two words:  Character development.  We hardly even know how old he is throughout the movie until his best friend, played by Ben Affleck just miraculously gets a car for him for his 21st birthday.  So where did Ben get this car?  Hmmm.

Also, what is the rival between both professors all about?  Vague descriptions of their past, but Williams depicts a down on his luck professor who if you think about closely is pretty much in the same boat as Hunting.  Struggling to cope with a troubled past.....which is??  Yes his wife has passed, but there's more to the professor's psyche.

The biggest hole I have a problem with as I mentioned earlier is the genius of Will Hunting.  What makes him this way?  Why can he solve complicated math equations, but is lacking common sense skills and a decent living for himself?  Who taught him as a youth?  Einstein started somewhere, where did Hunting start?

Overall, it's a good concept for a film and a great personal story of perseverance through several hardships and society around you.  However, you are required to suspend reality a bit and actually believe that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are Bostonian street toughs.  Who are they kidding??",1207872000,11,2205,4.706036745406824

87668,5,0788814664,"Good Will Hunting is a movie that touches on a number of particularly interesting themes in education and learning, and makes a profound statement about what it means to be accomplished.

Robin Williams' character eschewed the path of ivory-tower academic achievement at MIT to live out his life to the fullest - experiencing both great love and great loss, while his college roommate goes on to win some of the most prestigious awards in mathematics and become a full professor at MIT.

This contrast is a recurring theme in the movie, and of particular interest to me, because it is clear that Williams' character has learned deep truths about life by taking chances his roommate refused to take.  This life-affirming movie leaves us with a new understanding of the difference between being academically trained, and the perspectives that can only be gained from authentic experience.",1195603200,,886,5.096551724137931

87670,3,0788814664,"We survive performances by lead actors who do great imitations of telegraph poles, largely because, if the film is good enough, there's another unquestionably excellent lead who offsets disaster.  Thus, for every Greta Scacchi (""White Mischief""), there's a Charles Dance; for every Daniel Day-Lewis (""The Crucible""), there's a Winona Ryder; for every Hilary Swank (""Boys Don't Cry""), there's a Chloe Sevigny.  The first two suffer other minor flaws as well (novelized documentaries don't work; stylization and naturalism in the same film yield a bit of a mishmash), the third is a mess thanks to a major one (lousy script); but ""Good Will Hunting"" almost flopped thanks, and thanks only, to Matt Damon's inability to show emotion.

The film should be an unquestionable success.  We have THREE wonderful major supporting actors (Robin Williams stands out, but also Minnie Driver and Stellan Skarsgard); we have Gus van Sant's most credible scenario by a long chalk; and we have a splendid setting, even if much of ""Boston"" is recognizably Toronto.  And there are only two other faults I caught, both small: the fight scene is too choreographed; and what Harvard pre-med student would have sex without a condom with a janitor with a prison record?  In all, the auguries are good - and then Matt Damon ...

I think my assessment of ""Good Will Hunting"" is that there's too much ""almost"" and ""if only"".  Two scenes (the final clicking of therapist/patient, and the incomparable apples/'phone number) would have been quite wonderful if Williams had played it with even almost as good an actor, or if someone could have done van Sant's dialogue justice; as it is, we see near-misses, and at least know what a better actor would have done with them.  But who knows what we've lost in the Will/Lambeau relationship (the two should be visibly like oil and water), and who knows what bait Williams, a notorious ad-libber, dangled that wasn't taken up?  Damon is best where little is asked for him (Will sweeping floors, Will on the building site); and worst when he really has to emote.  None of the scenes with Minnie Driver is credible - could she really fall for such a self-centred idiot? - and there's so much of the Damon/Williams interplay that's only implicit and shouldn't have been.  And on, and on, and on.

By all means, see what van Sant can do at his best.  By all means, glory in Robin Williams' most winning performance.  Treat yourself to some really good cinematography.  But, unless you like beefcake, write off Matt Damon right now.",1190764800,4,2541,4.901869158878505
87671,5,0788814664,"With Good Will Hunting, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (Oscar, best writing, best screenplay) assert that their knowledge and maturity as filmmakers may even supersede their acting skills.  The co-written 1997 character study hits the viewer's heart and mind more fervently than the fists of its pugnacious main character.

Damon stars as Will Hunting, a cocky and confrontational twenty year old from south Boston who works construction by day and is a janitor at MIT by night.  Hunting, who was abused as a child, spends the majority of his time carousing at bars, picking fights, and charming women with his wit and charisma.  Affleck balances Damon's role fittingly as his simple minded best friend Chuckie, who also works construction and sees his fair share of courtrooms.

The best friends, however, share one distinct difference; Hunting is a self-taught genius, a mathematical savant capable of using his photographic memory to solve the academic world's most complex problems.  Damon's gift is discovered as he is casually solving an equation that renowned MIT math professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) has posted to challenge his best students.

After being arrested again on assault charges, Lambeau arranges the release of Hunting on the condition that he will agree to work with him on a weekly basis doing math problems and that he will see a therapist.  Hunting is unwillingly thrust into a journey to apply his potential and ability to a world that has perpetually rejected him throughout his adolescence.  After making fools of the first five therapists he is assigned, Hunting meets his match in Lambeau's old college roommate, Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), a similarly distraught man who gains as much from Will as Will from him.

Good Will Hunting could easily have been your typical ""intellectual prodigy, overcome odds to rise to the top"" inspirational story - and it almost is.  But the character development provided by the careful writing and exceptional directing by Gus Van Sant, along with an extraordinary cast and occasionally brilliant monologues by Damon and Williams - give the south Boston flick an edge and individuality that helped it earn nine Oscar nominations and two wins.

Williams (Oscar, best supporting actor) gives a typically impressive performance in a less characteristic fashion.  Though McGuire is introduced as a clever and dryly-humorous professor of psychology, his role as a troubled widower and passionate teacher is as intricate a character as he has ever played.  The first day of their meetings, Hunting rips through the core of McGuire's marital and psychological problems with the hasty examination of a painting hanging in his office, and McGuire becomes zealously determined to break through Hunting's tough exterior.

Affleck, Damon and Van Sant are able to avoid many of the popular stereotypes and film mechanisms typical of popular Hollywood blockbusters through cleverly simple filmography and deliberate writing.  The more dramatic scenes are not overwritten, nor are the violent scenes marked by fantastic action.  The attractiveness of the film comes from the development and dialogue of the characters, and from the personal, human characteristics that they possess.",1190332800,,3243,5.327450980392157

87684,5,0788814664,"When I first heard the name of this movie many years ago, I was wondering who Will was hunting?  Talk about your double-entendres for a title?  Now I know better; for the title tells us Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, is a good man; but a broken one like we all are who live in this imperfect world.

Anyway, I wasn't sure whether to see this film when it came out, but having come from a broken home myself, I loved the film once I saw it. Both Damon and Williams carry the plot line well while using their own natural charisma to draw you into their characters.  The camera work in this is also well done. Jean Escoffier did a marvelous job with all the shots.

It's a simple plot of a young man, orphaned; brilliant, who is disconnected in some ways from the world, well in need of love and understanding and who keeps himself protected via his brilliant mind.  He's a master wiz with math and is in need of a brilliant intercessor, played by Robin Williams, to help him find his place in the world: Enter in Robin Williams as the psychiatrist.  It's a great film dedicated to character development which I've always been big on, even when I was in my teens and twenties; which I must say is a nice walk away at times from the roller coaster ride thrillers Hollywood likes to put out these days.  So if you love good character development and a good delivery of the human condition; I'd watch this film.

Both Matt Damon and Robin Williams do a great job with the acting in this.  In the scene when Matt breaks down and starts to cry, once Williams brings his character to full term and the gestalt takes place between them in terms of Will Huntings greatest fear, tears started to come down my eyes as well when I think back of the broken home I came out of.  Great film: Not boring at all.  Well worth the price of admission!

The main character paints the NSA out to be some omnipotent, sinister organization which is out to drop bombs on harmless people in Africa. It's part of Hollywood's enormous campaign to brainwash the American people to agree with their line of thought, which is liberalism. In Hollywood land, every intelligent person is a liberal and of course the most intelligent person on the planet (who is played by Matt Damon in this movie) has come to the conclusion that the NSA is evil.

The NSA actually protects Americans from terrorism. It is simply an information-gathering organization and it is a vital part of our national defense. Don't let the Hollywood writers fool you. They are not as intellectually superior as they think they are. Steer clear of this film if you want to avoid being brainwashed, but I doubt if you'll be able to, as it is a favorite movie for cable companies.

I've lived in Boston, and people with that accent, bordering on speech impediment, do not become judges.  They become, well, teamsters and the like.

""Goodwill Hunting"" is a classic guy movie about guys who do guy things. Above all other story elements, this is a movie about boyhood friends and the uncompromising loyalty of those friendships. There are scenes here that should make you miss the buddies you turned of age with, those great friends who were there when you had your first drink, chased your first skirt and got into your first bar brawl.
Will Hunting is a genius and that becomes the crux of the film. He is a genius, yes. But mostly, he is a young man with the typical frustrations and misgivings that come with the age. He has issues with girls, issues with the law, and issues with his own place in the world.
This quickly became one of my all-time favorites because it is a movie with endless depth and substance. The story of the young punk with a criminal record outshining the rest of mathematical minds is compelling from the start. So is the attempt by the bedraggled but committed psychiatrist to reach the boy and the weird friendship that forms between them.
South Boston serves as a beautiful and shabby backdrop as Hunting feels himself drifting away from his buddies as his genius gets more attention from the world of universities and prestige he is unfamiliar with. He wants to continue working construction and hanging out in the seedy bars with his friends, rather than have his fluke ability exploited by men with greedy ambitions and concerns over petty things like tenure.
Matt Damon is stellar as the streetwise Hunting, an orphan with an attitude. Robin Williams leaves his goofiness behind and plays the aging psychiatrist who was once a tough young man just like the kid he is trying to help. While praising that pair, no one should overlook the talents of Ben Affleck, who was a credible actor before he started landing on the tabloid covers.
The relationship between Damon and Affleck is powerful. The latter knows his childhood friend is bound for great things and prods him to achieve in that silent, macho way good friends have.
""If you're still here in ten years, I'll kill you. That's not a threat, it's a fact. I'll freakin' kill you,"" Affleck says, as the two take time for a beer during lunch break at work. Because that is how good friends talk to each other when crucial matters are at hand.
Watching as Hunting battle with himself as he ponders the idea of flying away from the tough but familiar streets he grew up on is only half the allure of this film. Each character that comes into Hunting's world is rich and dynamic, and somehow vital to the decisions the young genius needs to make.
This one is never far off my top five list of all-time movie greats. And not just because it's great to see a tough southy intellectually thrashing a silver spoon college kid, either.",1146182400,4,2985,4.591760299625468
87693,5,0788814664,"'Good Will Hunting' will always remain one of my favorite movies. It has an engaging storyline, great acting, and enormous emotional depth. It's hard to believe Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were young college students when they concieved of this complex story.

The story is about Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a troubled young man who is working as a night janitor at Harvard University. He also happens to be a one-of-a-kind math genius, and catches the attention of award-winning math professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) as he begins solving difficult math problems left on the blackboard.

Will, however, has no interest in pursuing a prestigious career in mathematics. He only reluctantly agrees to hold private lessons with the proffesor, being the only way to get out of jail after a spate of violence lands him there. Part of his parole deal, however, is to meet with a therapist twice a week. After getting a couple of shrinks to give up on him, Will finally lands with psychology teacher Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) who has a similar background as Wills', hailing from the same tough neigborhood in south Boston.

As Sean tries to get through to Will emotionally, the professor tries to train Will's mind in advanced mathematics. All the while, Will, who has had trouble maintaining a loving relationships due to his troubled past, begins to get seriously involved with a girl named Skylar (Minnie Driver). Meanwhile, the professor and the psychiatrist, who've had a rivalry of sorts back in their day, begin to quibble over what's best for Will's future.

Filled with great profound dialouges and intense emotional scenes, it's an immense emotinal experience. It obviously has very 'heavy' subject-matter, and thus not an easy light watch, but it is very rewarding and entertaints throughout.

This movie is based on the idea that people who might be considered geniuses are around us but because of such things as poor health, not enough money, not knowing the ""right"" people, coming from ""the wrong side of the tracks,"" circumstances beyond their control, or just plain bad luck, these people cannot reach their true potential.  The screenplay was written by Matt Damon and Ben Afflick.  (Damon and Afflick won an Academy Award for best screenplay.)

This movie begins when somewhat snobbish MIT Mathematics Professor Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) decides to put an advanced mathematics problem (in Fourier Analyses) on a hallway chalk board and challenges anyone in his classes to solve it.  The next day the problem is solved but the person who did so does not reveal himself/herself.

So the professor decides to post another advanced math problem and this time, the person who solves it is caught in the act.  Who is this math wiz?  It turns out to be the lowly janitor named Will Hunting (Matt Damon) whom the professor learns is from ""the wrong side of the tracks.""  In fact, Will may be going to jail for a crime he committed but the math professor sees to it that this janitor is released into his custody but on the condition that he see a psychotherapist.

After going through five therapists, Will meets a therapist named Sean (Robin Williams) that wants to help him even though he does not want to be helped.  Will also meets a university student named Skylar (Minnie Driver) whom he has a relationship with.

The movie proceeds by revolving around four components of Will's life:

(1) His menial work and his group of friends.  Note that Ben Afflick plays one of his closest friends, Chuckie.
(2) His mathematical work with the math professor.
(3) His therapy work with the psychotherapist.
(4) His relationship with the university student.

I thought this movie was going to be boring and predictable.  Surprisingly, it drew me in.  One reason for this is that it's very realistic.  There's talk of such things as Rumanujam (a math genius who died young), Albert Einstein, and the Fields Medal (kind of like the Nobel Prize in mathematics).

Beware that there is much profanity in this movie.  I found that it added to the movie's realism.  The movie is also humorous in places.  As well, the background music adds to each scene.

I found all the acting superb.  Special kudos must go to Robin Williams who gives an incredibly restrained performance as the psychotherapist.  (Williams won an Academy Award for best supporting actor.)

Finally, the DVD (the one released in Dec. 1998) itself is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has several extras all of which I found interesting.

In conclusion, if you want to see a good movie that concentrates on relationships & feelings and deals with an interesting subject, then this movie is a must!!

87698,5,0788814664,"Well, this is a very good movie and it seemed to me then and now that a lot of it is because of the script. It is tight, farly seamless and flows nicely.

One repeated criticism is that the movie bends credibility to believe that a genius could be a janitor. Tut tut. Your arrogance is showing.

Everyone knows the plot by now so I don't feel I can add anything to the numerous details. What I recall as powerful was that I had never seen Matt Damon before, had never seen Robin Williams straight . . . .  errrrrrr in a straight role, and ditto Ben Afleck.

Now I have to jump ahead for a second. I really got into Robert Ludlum and the wonderful tales he wrote in the 70's and 80's. ""Parsifal Mosaic"" has got to be the all-time, best romantic non-stop suspense book I ever read. And sandwiched on either side of books like PM, is the 'Bourne Trilogy.' And I have to tell you, as Jason, I always imagined someone like Damon. For this reviewer, Matt Damon is the perfect lead of the haunted multi lingual, amnesiac-assassin.

So I recognize that at a minimum, Gus Van Sant, granted, an exceptional director, knew he had the real thing with Matt Damon and let him 'strut and fret his hour upon the stage.'

Credit must also be given for calming Robin Williams down. Someone ought to tell Mr. Williams that by now he's a pretty good actor when he's not doing Henny Youngman.

One of the top math professors at the university puts up a math problem that he suspects maybe by the end of the semester, one student can solve.  He is surprised that it is immediately solved by an unknown ""student.""  To try to flush the student out, he and his collegues put together a problem that took them two years to solve.  He then sees the janitor scribbling on the board.  When he yells at the janitor and frightens him away, he is surprised to see that the ""scribble"" is in fact the answer to the problem.  This leads him on a search to find the mysterious janitor.  When he does find him, he sees a super genious that needs to be tamed.

Cast:  Robin Williams, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, Stellan Skarsgard, Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser, John Mighton, Rachel Majorowski.

Running Time:  126 minutes

Rated R for strong language, including some sex-related dialogue.

The script for ""Good Will Hunting"" is the antithesis to the Hollywood system as we know it: two talented young actors (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck), yet to make their big break, come up with a polished, original, and personal script, rather than the screenplay-by-committee published by the major studios for the sole purpose of commercial gain. Every line of dialog, rather than succumbing to the pit of tired cliches, comes off original and with personality. Every scene, the characters relate to each other believably, while remaining completely engaging. Outside of maybe ""Pulp Fiction"", there had not been script this original and absorbing in some time.

Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is an orphan who has been to a number of abusive foster homes. At twenty, he starts working at the prestigious MIT as a caretaker on parole, since he's been involved in several assaults. One day the tough maths question on the board is found solved and the searching of the mystery genius begins. When Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) realises it is Will who has solved the difficult tasks, he decides to help him by offering him working on further maths studies and seeing a psychotherapist. Talented and yet highly defensive, Will manages to scare all the shrinks away and eventually Professor Lambeau has to turn to psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), his university roommate for help.  Sean's unique approach finally touches the deep inside of Will's complex and it gradually dilutes Will's insecurity and distrust of people. Meanwhile, Will falls in love with Harvard med student Skylar (Minnie Driver) but later has to confront his inner uncertainty. In the end, Sean and Will helps each other to deal with their own issues.

Robin Williams gives the performance of his career here, even topping his great work in ""Dead Poets Society"". Here, he's not the schmaltzy, kindhearted savior he's been in his last couple of movies, rather he's a good, intelligent, but flawed man who is there originally just to guide Will, but ultimately his experiences with will help him confront his own issues. His performance is not superficial, but nuanced--knowing about life, but at the same time, not knowing, and learning along with Will. Similarly, Matt Damon did a great job giving us the outwardly cocky genius-with-an-attitude that is deeply hurt inside and grows to show us that he doesn't know everything, but is willing to learn. Ben Affleck is amusing and honest as his friend Chuckie, and Stellan Skarsgard and Minnie Driver do great jobs in their respective roles as well.  The work of everyone involved in the film, particularly Damon, Affleck, and Williams, raises what could have been a complete cliche to cinematic excellence. Director Gus Van Sant, who derailed his career with the unwarranted remake of ""Psycho"", uses all the outstanding members of the cast to create an extremely heartwarming, effective drama.

87705,4,0788814664,"In case you haven't seen Good Will Hunting (it's OK...I hadn't seen it until 3 weeks ago), it tells the story of a poor Bostonian young man named Will, played by Matt Damon, who has had an incredibly turbulent life and whose social status prevents him from achieving something. Though Will is brilliant and should be attending a school like MIT, he mops its floors instead. After getting into some trouble with the law, a MIT professor who needs Will's help to solve a perplexing mathematical equation takes the young man under his wing and helps Will receive a lighter sentence, providing he goes to a therapist. After seeing many shrinks, Will finally meets with Sean, played by Robin Williams, who eventually guides and befriends the reluctant Will.

Good Will Hunting is by far one of the most intelligent, well written films I've seen in a long time and it's quite deserving of its Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Moreover, Robin Williams shines as the psychologist who is struggling to battle his own feelings of loneliness and worthlessness after the passing of his wife, and Damon is incredible as the hard-edged genius at the core of the film. Minnie Driver is also very likable as Will's girlfriend who constantly tries to get him to open up without angering him in the process.

Unfortunately, Ben Affleck as Will's best friend Chuckie is downright annoying. He tries to steal each scene he's in by screaming in his thick Boston accent or by stepping on the lines of other actors, but he fails to be compelling or interesting. I think I actually groaned every time he appeared on the screen. Still, overall Good Will Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable film.",1133308800,2,1671,4.818815331010453
87706,5,0788814664,"When searching for intellectual success and humanistic relationships between life and career, there is a simple formula which works for a few people. It is an equation which reads, Superior intellectual equals power, but results in pain and isolation. Such is the story of Will Hunting, superbly played by Matt Damon. Born with an I. Q. Genius, the young man seeks friends and mathematical challenges alike. Consequencly, when he finds either, he attacks one and embraces the other. As a result, he lives in a world of turmoil and volatile possibilities. Unable to tolerate authoritative or academic hypocrisy, he armors himself with the sword and shield of intellectual arrogance and gives battle to anyone and everything around him. What troubles him the most is the dark pain of abuse in his youth and it is here he is most vulnerable. Robin Williams who portrays Dr. Sean Maguire give one of his most stirring performances as a sensitive and compassionate psychiatrist. Equally matched as they are adroit, the two battle in an emotional arena, each seeking to fathom the other. The result? The creation of a truly remarkable film. ****",1131580800,2,1139,5.031746031746032
87707,4,0788814664,"Enjoyable and captivating.

It's the story of how a group of roughian Boston South-side-of-towners (""Southies"") live, and how one of the group (Matt Damon) seems to have a supernatural ability to solve math problems, absorb information from text books and interpret the info his own way. This ability is noticed by a math professor who attempts to cultivate Damon's character into a professional that uses the ability to succeed in government or business.

A psychiatrist is brought in to help tailor Damon into a more personable character, and a struggle ensues between the professor, the psychiatrist and Damon himself on what direction Damon's life should go in.

Ultimately very well done, and definitely NOT A CHICK-FLICK.

Not my kind of purchase, but definitely worth renting.

87708,5,0788814664,"I love this movie; I have it on VHS and DVD. I've seen it about ten times, and sadly, can basically quote the whole thing word for word.

I first saw it in 1998 or so, when I was 11, and loved it. Since then, I picked it up again and watched it- needless to say, there's a good bit more of it that I actually understand...

One thing I do not understand, however, is why some reviewers referring to Ben Affleck's character- Chuckie- as Will's ""dumb sidekick."" While next to Will, sure, he would look like a ""retarded gorilla"" (wouldn't anyone?),he came off as quite smart- just uneducated. To be sure he's no genius, but he was plenty intelligent.

Ben's line near the end about Will getting the hell out of Southie (South Boston), and making something of himself are powerful. ""You know, you're my best friend so don't take this the wrong way, but if you're still here in twenty years... I'll kill you.""

87709,5,0788814664,"A mathematics professor was forced to track down the mysterious man who solved a mathematics problem that took professionals years to solve. That man turned out to be Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who incidentally works as a janitor in that said university. After being incarcerated for a series of assault charges, professor Lambeau (Stellen Skarsgard) took Will under his wing provided that he would work on some mathematics related exercises and that he would undergo therapy every week.

Will, the genius that he is, knows how to push the buttons of the therapists assigned to him. He made them all quit until Sean (Robin Williams) came along who knows exactly what Will was doing. Their sessions together gave Will the ability to emotionally articulate the painful past he had that affected his relationship with people.

Chuckie (Ben Affleck) is Will's loyal friend, the only person whom he can share at least a little part of what he feels. Skylar (Minnie Driver) is the love interest  significant to Will's ""emotional"" opening up. Will's relationship with the two characters was resonant and poignant. Will and Sean's relationship was the heart of the movie, but the soul lies in the relationship of Will to those two characters.

The movie's got an involving and affecting story that is beautifully put into screen by Damon and Affleck's screenplay. It is beautifully paced and shot and all the characters were able to assert their significance in the movie by allowing them to have character defining scenes. Performances were all great. Robin Williams in an understated performance was effective in capturing the ""quiet spunk"" of the character. Minnie Driver was heartbreaking and transcended the `love interest"" label. Stellan Skarsgard also struck some chord as he trains a genius who was intellectually ahead of him. Ben Affleck also provides an effective support that is both showy and honest. Last but not the least, Matt Damon in a career making performance, solidified his way into major star status. He gave the right combination of charm, humor, restrained emoting, and ultimately allowing himself to be vulnerable. Good Will Hunting to Matt Damon is what The Fabulous Baker Boys is to Michelle Pfeiffer and Saturday Night Fever is to John Travolta

Two beautiful scenes were instrumental to the ending. One was when Chuckie told Will that every time he picks him up in his house he secretly wishes that he'd be gone without any goodbye whatsoever because he hates seeing him wasting his life. Another one was when Sean in one of their sessions told Will the day he realized that he wanted to spend the rest of his life to his now deceased wife. The sentiments of those two scenes were used beautifully in the ending.  The movie wraps up as the end credits rolls with the shot of Will's car in the free way heading somewhere. The ending was understated, powerful, classy, and memorable. A perfect ending to one gem of a movie.

And the one scene that I really liked was when Matt Damon has his breakthrough with the ""It's not your fault"" scene.  The movie should've ended then and there.

Perhaps I am a little prejudiced, I can admit it.  I thought this movie was hyped up to be something it couldn't live up to, and it was to me.  This was before Bennifer, the Academy Awards, and all the who-dumped-who gossip.  All those things shaped my opinion at a later date.  Matt Damon is clearly the brains behind the operation, and he got the recognition he deserves, but Ben Affleck is a dingbat who just likes to party.

87715,2,0788814664,"Good Will Hunting by Gus Van Sant was hugely sucessful when it came out. It portrayes the life of a poor janitor who is exceptionally talented in mathematics. Matt Damon is emotionally disturbed and tries to push off people coming too close to him. While parts of the movie are OK, there is too much cheesiness in this movie. There are enough mathematicians and logicians lives that are confusing enough as it is. Take the life of Kurt Godel, the Austrian logician. Robin Williams role as the Psychiatryst bringing out Matt Damon was over done. There was no professionalism in the roles. The amount of bad language is also too much for someone connected with such a movie.

As I have seen multiple times, Hollywood is terrible at portraying science and scientists. It shows Matt Damon good at Chemistry, Mathematics, History and Economics. Areas nowadays are so advanced that people have trouble keeping up with parts of one area, there is no way anyone can be a novice at multiple areas let alone an expert. As the mathematician Hardy said after seeing Ramanujan's papers, that he was able to spend considerable time only on Hypergeometric series, as it was close to his heart. Also, it shows the lack of understanding of Mathematics too, the great days of theorem proving are gone, nowadays most mathematical research is spent on developing new areas of math or in connecting seemingly unconnected areas of math. One mathematician, Polya, refused to prove existing areas as he wanted to develop his own areas. I would sincerely hope that directors would take more trouble with their research before starting on such movies. The movie shows something about Fields medals but has no clue of the kind of people who win them, which shows how simplistic it is. Overall, I hope that people who makes movies like this and Beautiful Mind do more work before doing such a silly job.",1123632000,10,1875,4.8229813664596275

Will needed a hug, validation and reassurance after so many years of maintaining a veneer of emotional callousness and aloofness, brought on by so many years of abuse from his father putting out cigarettes butts on his skin and then being shipped off to many different foster homes. It was a release for him to cry. Shedding tears does not make a man ""gay."" I've never heard a used car described as ""an orange disgrace of a pumpkin."" Never.

It doesn't even take place in the wilderness with the exception of the scene where Sean is calling out Damon on a park bench. There are a few swans swimming in the pond but they can't be hunting those because it is illegal to hunt swans to begin with.  This movie tries to portay Will as some kind of Pimp Daddy by showing his smooth skills while wheeling and dealing Skylar (Mimi Rogers) which for starters doesn't seem like much of a challenge considering I think something was going on with her and the Michael Bolton clone and secondly, I think Will and Sean were gay for each other.  If there was a sequel, it would most likely show Will driving back to Boston in that orange disgrace of a pumpkin (car) in search of his true love Sean.

87724,5,0788814664,"I avoided seeing ""Good Will Hunting"" for years due to its reputation as a ""bad pic disguised as an Indie flick"".  Then, one night, I decided to try it.  How bad could it be?  If it was awful, I figured, at least with Affleck it oughta be funny (in an unintentional way).

But guess what?  It wasn't funny.  It wasn't bad.  In fact, it was pretty near great.

The story has been done before, albeit in slightly different form, so don't look for anything too special here.  Young Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is, secretly, a mathematical genius, who puts out a rebellious attitudeto disguise this.  While working as a janitor, his talent is discovered by a college professor (Stellan Skarsgard), and from there Will's life is changed forever.  He meets his dream girl (Minnie Driver) and undergoes psychological therapy in an attempt to fix up his attitude.  The only shrink who has any chance with Will, however, is another college professor: Sean Maguire, played by Robin Williams.  Along with his best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck), Will embarks on a journey that will change his life forever.

Damon and Affleck, at the time relatively new to filmmaking, grabbed an Academy Award for ""Best Original Screenplay"" for writing the tale of ""Good Will Hunting"".  Williams also received an Academy Award for ""Best Supporting Actor"", and the film was nominated for seven other awards including ""Best Picture"".  The cast is terrific here - even Affleck isn't horrible - but it's Damon and Williams whose performances really reach out and grab you.

Someone who should have won an Oscar was director Gus Van Sant.  His unique directing style gets moving performances from the entire cast and really brings to life Damon and Affleck's otherwise ordinary script.  There's also a not-so-remarkable score by Danny Elfman.

I find this film to be severely underrated.  If you give it a small chance, it will really have an effect on you.

We were all in agreement that the movie was competent but forgettable -- an unexceptional Hollywood fare, complete with utterly predictable ending, posing as an ""indie.""

There is little here you haven't seen before.  Sure, the ""boy math genius"" angle adds a slightly different twist to the ""downtown boy meets uptown girl"" formula, but it isn't anything like enough to sustain this movie for the 2 hour running time.  At first one is amazed to see Robin Williams showing actual restraint from his usually highly annoying over the top shtick until you realize that the whole thing was for him to show ""sensitivity"" to get him an Oscar.  Ca-ching.  It worked.

If you have managed to get thorough the past 7 years without seeing this movie there is no reason to take the time to correct it.  If you have already seen it, it is difficult to think of a scenario under which you might feel even remotely compelled to see it again.  If, for reasons known only to you, you STILL feel like this is a must see, tape it from one of the 4 billion times a year it is shown on Bravo and then fast forward through the commercials.

87726,5,0788814664,"Believe it or not, there was actually a time when the now famed ""Good Will Hunting"" was just the little-movie-that-could.  When it was released in the late 90s, America was under the mighty ""Titanic"" spell, and any actors who weren't named Leonardo or Winslett basically got ignored.  In fact, for what it's worth, the film was not a major blockbuster by anyone's standards.  The director, Gus Van Sant, had somewhat of a cult following (thanks to previous movies such as ""My Own Private Idaho"") but little else. Matt Damon (who plays the lead) and Ben Affleck (who plays his friend) were still Hollywood mid-carders. The only thing the film had going for it on a marketing level was Robin Williams.

But low and behold, audiences began to click with it.  Damon and Williams had an on-screen chemistry that rivaled Leo's and Kate's, and the screenplay (written by Damon and Affleck in college) was...well, brilliant (it eventually won an oscar).

In case you don't know, the film is about a troubled Boston youth (Damon) who is from the wrong side of town but posesses  a brilliant photographic academic mind.  Damon eventually begins seeing Williams, a therapist, and the story goes from there.  The tone and theme are very academic and carpe-diem, similar to another Robin Williams film, ""Dead Poets Society,"" but with a more gritty edge. It also seems influenced by the classic Peter Schaffer play, Equus (probably a mere coincidence, though) in that the film straddles the theme of the therapist ultimately becoming the patient, and vice versa.

The film has achieved somewhat legendary status among college students over the years as THE inspiring story about love, friendship, loyalty, and plunging into the real world. Whatever the case, if it wasn't for this movie, Damon and Affleck would most likely not be where they are today.  It was the oscar that they received that truly made Hollywood open its eyes to the duo.  It's a shame that they both seemed to have possibly peaked as far as creative energy is concerned.

87727,5,0788814664,"Good Will Hunting is one of the best movie I've ever seen and I just can't forget how terrific it is. The story of this movie is extremely well-written and the movie itself is very well-acted by great actors such as Robin William, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and many more. I can really feel the emotions when I was watching the movie because the actors, especially William and Damon have shown remarkable efforts to make their character more appealing through their outstanding performence in the role each of them played.

The story relates about an orphan kid, Will Hunting(Matt Damon) who was brought up in foster families and had bitter experience of abusement by his foster fathers during his childhood age. He grew up in a state of being abandoned and therefore, he's always afraid of being rejected by other people. Now, he has grown up with terrible characteristics. He's been charged several times for assault and other crimes. He often goofs around with his friends who happen to be pricks and this made his life looks pathetic.

BUT, he's very gifted in academic. This is because he prefers to read in the library. He rather to read on his own  than studying in some unecessary overspending bucks universities(that's what he thinks). His talent in mathematic is noticed by a professor(Prof. Lambeau) in the university where he's working as a janitor. Will managed to solve a mathematical teorem about calculus on a board written by Lambeau where no any other brilliant student could in that university.

Lambeau is having hard time finding who's the mystery guy who solved the teorem. He bailed Will from jail(charged on assault) when he finds out that Will is the person. Lambeau wishes to lead Will to the correct path and brighter future of his life and so, he brings Will to meet a few shrinks to give him counselling sessions. Unfortunately, no one managed to handle the wild-charactered Will till he brings him to meet his college friend, Dr. Sean (Robin William)who happen to be a counsellor. Although Will is wild, but Sean be very patient with him because he knows that he will eventually reaches Will's heart of hearts. Finally, he did. Because both of them have quite a similar childhood experience, they managed to communicate with each other and get to talk about their own feeling. At the end, Sean succeeded to enlighten Will's mind and he has changed from a spoiled brat to a rational thinker. He then realized what's important for his life.

The ending is sweet where Will is after his love life where he  rejected at first and heading to find his girlfriend. Meanwhile, the relation between Lambeau and Sean which is bitter at first turned out to be better at the end. The ending is very nice and complete for such a movie. If anyone watches this movie carefully and attentionly, they will find a few messages that this movie brings is very EDUCATIONAL and could be taken as lessons for us nowadays.

After watching this movie, I feel that Robin William truly deserves his Oscar for BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR and Damon and Affleck indeed deserve their Oscar for BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY for the movie in 1998. The other elements in this movie such as sounds, musics, cinematography and a few more are also very wonderful. I feel that it's just very very unlucky for this movie to be competing against Titanic(1997) in that year for several Oscar's categories nomination for the winner. I bet this magnificent movie could've won a few more Oscars back then if it's not released in the same year as the luminious Oscars winning movie, Titanic.

Still, this movie is a GREAT MASTERPIECE written by Damon and Affleck and directed by Gus Van Sant. It WILL be remebered for years. Watch it yourself to realize how magnificent it is! EXCELLENT!",1099612800,7,3759,4.790123456790123
87728,4,0788814664,"Good Will Hunting is a movie drama that was released in 1997 and has a running time of 126 mimutes. The director Gus Van Zant and Miramax Home Entertainment absolutely came through together in making a very enjoyable film that still has not lost its luster, even after 7 years. However, Gus had a pretty amazing cast to work with including such actors as Robin Williams, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Mini Driver. Robin Williams won Best Supporting Actor, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck won Best Original Screenplay, which was quite an honor for them being as young and underexperienced as they were at the time.

The movie was set in 1997 in the South Boston suburbs or Southy as they referred to several times throughout the movie. It is more or less the lower income side of Boston in which Matt Damon (Will Hunting) and Ben Affleck (Chuckie Sullivan)and a few of the other supporting actors were from. The major theme of the movie was to watch Matt (Will Hunting) going through his life with history of parental abuse and living in several different homes while growing up and learning to deal with it by talking to Robin (Sean Maguire) a community college counselor who was also originally from Southy.

Will Hunting is a janitor at MIT one the most prestigous colleges in the world. During his late night shifts Will would solve very complicated math problems left on the board for other students to solve. For the longest time the professor and other students could not figure out who was solving them until one night when Stellan Skarsgard (Proffessor Lambeau) caught Will solving his prolems. Eventually Professor Lambeau ended up finding were Will was and actually ended up bailing him out of jail for a fight that Will had gotten in to. Will (who has a genuis IQ) had to promise to spend time with the professor solving problems and also had to agree to go to counseling to for his anger.

After going through several shrinks Professor Lambeau gives one last chance with an old college buddy that he had a fallen out with years ago, which was Robin (Sean). Sean and Will battle it out several times, but Will stays with Sean because he knows he grew up the same way he did and he respects that. One my favorite parts of the movie is when Will and Sean are sitting on a park bench and Sean who had been getting reemed by Will on an emotional level the last few times they had met, starts asking Will if he had ever done anything or been anywhere that he had read in a book, even though Will never spoke during this scene it was a breaking point for Will, becasue this is one the first times anyone had ever challenged him and he didn't know how to respond.

So eventually Will meets a girl Skylar (Mini Driver) and he likes her alot but he can't seem to get to emotionally into her, because of his past and everybody usually leaving him. Just when he started getting attached to them they seemed to always take off, except for his friends (Chuckie, Morgan, and Tom)which was the only family he had left. By now Will and Sean are doing pretty good in their talks and the professor is trying to get Will a job, but Will doesn't want any of these jobs. Then he learns that Skylar is going to another school and wants Will to go with her, but he declines because of his attachment issues.

The final scenes has Will going into Sean's office and they begin talking about the past abuse some more and Will begins to cry and you can tell that Will has finally broken through his past history of abuse and abandonment and feels like now he can be more open and emotionally attached to people. The final scene has Will driving to find Skylar.

This is by far one of my favorite movies and the best part about this drama is that there was comedy in and out of it that allowed you to be closer with the actors. I ranked this film with four stars because everytime I watch it I get the same reaction and not to many movies can do that over and over.",1099094400,5,3942,4.422865013774104

The characters are always interesting and you are always trying to guess what they will do next.  I would agree with one review who said ""Ordinary People"" was a better film, but this is a keeper.

87731,2,0788814664,"In GOOD WILL HUNTING, the film was intriguing when Will Hunting, (Matt Damon), a night custodian, solves the math equation on the hallway chalkboard at the University and the Math Professor, Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgrd-EXCORCIST: THE BEGINNING) trying to figure out who did it.  This reviewer thought that this was going to be the main focus of the film in which Will Hunting was going to be put to the test on his math genius.  However, that's not the case.  The audience finds out Will Hunting has a chip on his shoulder, a bad attitude, a criminal record, and needs psychological analysis. Once the film establishes the fact that we know of Will Hunting's high inteligence, it shifts to trying to find out why he's such an angry young man. The character of  Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) comes into play as the therapist to dig into Hunting's psyche and then a side-plot of a romance with Skylar (Minnie Driver- RETURN TO ME)is added to complicate matters. These two aspects of the film overtakes the rest of the film and it becomes maudlin and unfocused. We see a mutual respect develop between Hunting and McGuire, but the romance between Hunting and Skylar is a distraction especially when it becomes the basis of the ending of the film when Will Hunting has to make a decision on his future. In conclusion, the film's initial set-up or first quarter of the film was great when showing Will Hunting's genius behind the working class exterior, but the film shifts to trying to psychoanalyze him along with his stormy relationship with Skylar and it becomes uninteresting and unwatchable.",1096848000,3,1590,4.834558823529412

87733,5,0788814664,"The screenplay,direction & performances form the essence of any movie. And surely this essence is present in this movie in form of a beautiful screenplay by Matt Damon & Ben Affleck, the precise & very sensitive direction by Gus Van Sant. And last but not the least to mention the heartfelt performances by Matt Damon & Robin Williams.

'Good Will Hunting' is about a boy who knows himself much better than anyone else could possibly know,who is a whiz kid in mathematics;but works as a caretaker at MIT often solving  the most complicated problems on the walls of the university. To do so he has his own reasons of not to be away from his friends and of a painful childhood that he has left far behind somewhere but still its presence is not completely washed off. Will's(Matt Damon) genius is discovered by professor Gerald(Stellan Skarsgard)who takes charge of rescuing him from the inhibitions he has built up within himself, with the help of a fellow friend psychiatrist Sean(Robin Williams). This was not at all easy, but with time ticking the reluctance grows into a respect & understanding of a very high stature which doesn't necessarily comprise of big actions, but of little & soft moments. Best friend Chuckie(Ben Affleck) & lover Skylar(Minnie Driver) also play a major role in pushing Will to realise something he already knows and which is well deserved by him.

The therapy sessions shown are humorous as well as very touching. The most heart-rending one was when Will finally breaks in front of Sean by repeatedly saying 'Don't mess with me Sean'. This scene will naturally have tears rolling down ur cheeks and a gush of feelings hard to handle.

This movie becomes special & different in presenting the statement 'there is nothing wrong in men crying..'. Emotions cannot be a domain of any particular sex.

Every once in a while you come across something that you don't want to forget or can't forget. This HUNTING WILL defintely leave a GOOD impression to last a lifetime!",1095984000,8,1992,4.829912023460411
87734,4,0788814664,"Good Will Hunting was a good story about a boy genius, named Will hunting.  Will, played by Matt Damon, knows he's smarter than almost anyone, book smart that is.  Yet when a college professor at Harvard discovers his genius, Will is offish and unwilling to cooperate with others, preferring the simple life with his friends.  After one of many crimes, Will is, under the teacher's supervision, allowed his freedom if he practices math and goes to therapy.  Although the math aspect of the movie is the binding aspect, it is Will's volatile personality that is the true core of the film.  Robin Williams' character, for which he won an Oscar, is one of many psychiatrists.  Yet his tough love helps us see the deeper side of Will Hunting.

 This entire beautiful tale is part of the superb screenplay.  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote it, and because of it they won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.  This is because the story, along with the richness of the acting, truly enables us to understand Will's character.  We get a glimpse of what it might be like struggling with domestic problems, or growing up a poor kid in south Boston, or just how much deep hurt and aguish can a person have balled up inside them.  The movie is very good, with only the seeming question as when does Robin William's come in, because his part is fairly late in the film.  Yet that is not an issue because the acting throughout this movie is great.  I would give it a 4.5 if I could but since I cannot, and I only round down, it easily achieves a four star rating.",1094342400,4,1552,4.496428571428571
87735,5,0788814664,"""Good Will Hunting"" is a non-musical version of ""Amadeus"" with Will Hunting as Mozart and the Professor as Salieri.  The difference is that in ""Amadeus"" you can hear the genius of Mozart, but in ""Good Will Hunting"" Matt Damon projects intelligence and there are suggestions, but no demonstrations, of Will's genius.  It is an excellent movie, expecially when cleaned up for TV.  It is probably Robin Williams' best role.
There are comic moments that bring out the absence of demonstration of Will's genius.  One is when he goes to the girl's dorm and she tells him she has to get the ""proton spectrum"" of ebolamine.  I never heard of a proton spectrum, and what Will presents to her is not any kind of spectrum, rather it is a structual formula for what appears to be a complex ringed alaphatic molecule.",1093564800,3,804,4.714285714285714
87736,1,0788814664,"When juvenile delinquent janitor Will Hunting (Damon) is not busy changing the sanitary cakes in the urinals or cleaning up vomit, he solves complex multinomial equations in his head and reads unabridged history books.  He can stand head-to-head in intellectual debates with Harvard graduate students, and then booze it up and street fight with his low-life Southy buddies.  Then, when there's crime occuring nearby, he goes into a telephone booth and...ooh...wait...wrong guy...

This movie should have been labeled as a comedy, as there is very little here that will fail to make you laugh.  Or better yet, science fiction, because it pushes the outer limits of absurdity with an ill-concieved plotline that involves a college janitor who is intellectually gifted (?), but has never realized his potential. A college professor discovers Hunting's talent for solving complex equations and tries to reform him through psychoanalysis.

Good Will Hunting fails to impress on three levels.  First, the plot is utterly unbelieveable.  Second, the dialogue is very abrasive to anyone with a post-secondary degree.  And finally, the two main characters (Williams and Damon)in the movie are unlikable.  No big bash here on Affleck or Damon, I think they're both good actors (especially Damon), but as screenwriters, the two are a joke.

With regard to the first and second points (on the plot and dialouge that is), I am sure that there are possibly a few people out there in the real world gifted with exceptionally high IQs and, because of circumstances beyond thier control, are relgated to doing menial labor.  On a similar note, there are probably a few people out there with low IQs who are fortunate enough to hold high ranking positions in society, such as some political officals (ahem).

However, it is inconcievable for any human being to *naturally* grasp concepts in subjects such as History, Economics, Statistics, Psychology and Organic Chemistry without the benefit of caring tutilidge.  It is hard enough to master any one of these subjects, let alone all, as Hunting seemingly does.  This aspect of the plot will cause anyone with a Bachelor's Degree or higher to want to hurl rubber bricks at the television set.  I believe that it was Einstien who said that: ""genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration"" (or was that Weird Al Yankovic?).  No matter.

And herein lies the difference between good screenwriting and bad.  Any story about a downtrodden and orphaned janitor trying to educate himself against all odds could have been a winner, if it were played out as a realistic production.  Why did Affleck and Damon *need* to play upon adolescent fantasy and make Hunting the second coming of the Messiah?  Good drama does not require such sensationalism.

With regard to the third point, both Hunting and the Williams' characters are unlikable.  Hunting, is a pariah ""know-it-all"" with a chip on his shoulder who delights in showing up psychologists up for his own amusement.  While Damon does a good job of acting the part, I had no feeling or sympathy for his character.  Specifically, I think that it would be very unlikely that anyone with such a high level of intellectual and cultural awareness would be such a callous social retard.  (For Pete's Sake buddy, what part of: ""You're going to jail if you don't humor the shrinks!"" does this supposed genius not understand?!) Even Forrest Gump would probably agree that a protagonist in any movie should have some redeeming qualities.

Williams, on the other hand, sucks eggs and is one-dimensional.  He plays the same damn character in every movie he's been in since Good Morning Vietnam.  He's become a fixture as the ""lovable, sensitive and funny"" guy and it's getting old.  They always give him the role that is supposed to make you feel sorry for him and cry.  In this movie, he's the widower psychologist and the only guy who can relate to Will Hunting because he's from the same upbringing.  How utterly cliche!  Can I have an Oscar too?",1091923200,25,4012,4.995481927710843
87737,5,0788814664,"This movie is either perfect, or as close as it's possible for a movie to be. The acting is outstanding. The direction is terrific. The script is heartfelt and real. The soundtrack, featuring Elliot Smith, is perfectly suited to the movie. All in all, it's one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, and it's my personal favorite.
Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a janitor at MIT who harbors a secret genius for mathematics. Rather than bank on his intelligence, he spends most of his time riding around and drinking with his buddies (Ben Affleck, Cole Hauser, and a particularly funny and excellent Casey Affleck). However, his gift is discovered by a professor at the university (Stellan Skarsgard) who bails Will out of jail (in on a count of assault) on the conditions that he start doing math regularly with the professor and that he see a psychiatrist. Enter the psychiatrist, Sean (Robin Williams). To add to the mix, Will meets a Harvard student, Skylar (Minnie Driver) who is possibly the first woman for whom he's ever had real feelings. Over the course of the movie, all of these characters in their own way try to make Will live up to his potential.
The movie doesn't have much of a plot other than this -- however, that's fine, because it's meant to be more of a character study and it's a great one. Pretty much every scene is two people sitting down talking to each other -- yet it holds the viewer's interest because the characters are so captivating. Sean and Will's scenes in particular are terrific. Matt Damon and Robin Williams, besides both being fine actors, have a natural chemistry that you just can't fake. Damon and Minnie Driver are also great together (of course, as it's widely known, the two dated during the filming of the movie) and it's my opinion that both were robbed of their Oscars.
Ben Affleck shows that spark in this movie which he showed in most of his '90s movies, and he's great in his role -- but even better is his brother Casey. Watch the movie with the audio commentary, and you'll gain so much more appreciation for both the role of Morgan and the actor Casey. The same goes for Stellan Skarsgard. Cole Hauser is good with the few lines he has.
All in all, this is a great movie -- beautifully shot, well-written . . . well, I've said it all before. If you're not offended by excessive use of the word ""f***"" (and yes, some people really do talk like that) you should love it. Forget the naysayers -- ""Good Will Hunting"" is one of the most heartfelt, poignant movies in recent history. Too bad all the awards that year automatically went to the movie with the grandest special effects instead of the one with better dialogue and better characters.",1089590400,5,2693,4.600831600831601
87738,4,0788814664,"This quiet drama about what genius means was the surprise hit of 1997, with friends Matt Damon and Ben Affleck both collaborating on the screenplay and acting.  Damon plays Will Hunting, a troubled, gruff young man who works as a janitor at MIT despite his incredible self-education and intelligence.  When a mathematics professor discovers that Will has solved a complicated problem left on the blackboard, he pursues Will as a potential prot&eacute;g&eacute;.  But Will is not good with authority figures, as his past includes abuse at the hands of his father. When Will lands in jail, however, and the professor manages to obtain his release with the stipulation that Will work on mathematics with him and see a counselor, Will's whole life begins to open up.  As a patient of psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), Will forges a relationship that acts as a catalyst for a new future.
Matt Damon does a wonderful job with the title role, although at times he seems a little wooden.  As the therapist with a painful history that Will eventually connects with, Robin Williams turns in one of his less flamboyant performances.  His suffering is palpable, and his need to save Will from himself lends real passion to the film.  Affleck provides solid balance as Will's friend Chuckie, although his performance is less memorable than the other two, more of a function of the role than the actor.  Minnie Driver is charming and believable as Will's new girlfriend Skylar.
The screenplay is intelligent and skillfully developed despite some unbelievable facets of the premise, most notably that such a wounded individual, no matter how bright, would have the discipline to teach himself as much as Will knows.  Still, this movie only gets better as it progresses.  The relationship between Will and his therapist is dynamic, poignant, and meaningful.
This is a good film to own, as it uncovers additional subtleties on second viewing, as long as you don't mind revisiting emotional angst.  Its feel-good story arc is somewhat predictable, but the dialogue and interactions are not, making this flick surprisingly complex given the young ages of Damon and Affleck when it was made.",1087516800,36,2181,5.064245810055866
87739,5,0788814664,"This film, which was the first time for Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, in writing a screenplay, turned into a movie, is an impressive piece of work.  About a shy, yet with an attitude, young man (who as we find out later was abused) who demonstrates his brilliance, but who will not let people get too close.  Ben Affleck (before all of this ""Bennifer"" nonsense) is good as his buddy, who really wants him to use his ""gift"".  With an outstanding performance by Robin Williams (who deserved his award) and Minnie Driver, the lads have put together a funny, poignant, movie; which wasn't ""overdone"" as some movies might be.  Williams and Damon interact with each other with the right amount of ""attitude"" as they help each other overcome their fears, hopes, missed opportunities, and dreams.  A better film than I thought it would be.  I'd recommend it.  The downside (for peope offended by language, i.e., profanity, is that there is a lot of it, especially the ""F"" word).  If one can overlook that, if one's offended [I'm not overly so]; then, this movie speaks to the person inside all of us, as we ask ourselves some basic questions; what do we want out of life, do we have regrets, did we try hard enough to succeed, what does success mean, and so on. Damon's character refused to be ""manipulated"" by anyone, including the professor who had his own issues.  Definitely worth seeing.

I had seen the trailer a long time ago and thought that the trailer had said it all.  I was wrong.  This film is a lot more than the plot.  It is the story of a brilliant rough working class young man in from South Boston (Matt Damon) who retains everything he reads.  He's a janitor at MIT and solves mathematical problems on the blackboard after class.  He gets into a lot of fights and when he is arrested the mathematics professor who realizes what a genius he is, puts up bail on the proviso he get counseling with psychologist Robin Williams. What follows is a original, tight, and deeply moving movie.  There is more wisdom in this one movie than I have ever seen on the screen before, and it is totally involving.
I understand that before Matt Damon was an actor, he wrote this story as a 50 page assignment for a creative writing class at Harvard.  The story haunted him, however, and with his friend, fellow actor Ben Affleck, they created the screenplay by improvising each scene together.  What resulted was this work of art.

87741,5,0788814664,"Many reviewers have focused on the acting and the story as the basis for their positive reviews, but there are two scenes that really make this movie, although I think the subtlety of their connection sometimes escapes people.  Even Amazon's reviewer called the script ""clunky"" or some such condescending insult, making me think he missed this too.
SPOILER
The first scene occurs when Will Hunting and his posse go out on the town one night, and instead of going to their regular Southie hangouts, they hit a ""Hahvahd bah"".  After a series of amusing events, there is a confrontation between Will and an arrogant Harvard undergrad, Clark.  Clark, assuming Will is just some uneducated Southie scum, starts quoting from one of his history/economics textbooks, passing it off as his own thoughts, assuming that no one will recognize the true source of his words, in an attempt to impress some nearby girls.  Will, having read the same book in his free time, recognizes the passage, interrupts, and finishes it for Clark, even quoting the book title, author, and page number, and thoroughly embarrassing Clark.  Will asks, ""are you going to plagiarize the entire book for me, or do you have an original thought of your own?""  The humiliated student resorts to the lame comeback that at least he'll ""have a degree, and Will will one day be serving his kids fries at the drive-through.""  Will responds, ""at least I won't be unoriginal,"" and invites Clark to step outside to further ""discuss"" it.  Clark meekly declines, ending the scene.
The second scene occurs after Will has been recognized and bailed out from jail by an MIT professor, Lambeau.  Lambeau's two conditions for bailing out Will were that Will spend several days a week working on mathematics with Lambeau, and working in therapy with a psychologist.  However, Will inevitably proves smarter than all the psychologists Lambeau enlists, finding various ways to turn the tables and expose their own shortcomings and insecurities, rather than opening up about and dealing with his own, offending them and humiliating them to the point where they refuse to continue working with Will.  Finally, Lambeau enlists the aid of Sean (Robin Williams), his old MIT undergrad roomate with whom he has fallen out of touch over the years.  Sean, a Southie native like Will, is psychology prof at a local Boston college, and is a man living an empty, dead life, still grieving over the death of his beloved wife to cancer two years ago.  In short order, Will cruelly exposes Sean's pain, and believing himself to be the victor once again, exits the session.  But Sean is no quitter, and tells Lambeau to schedule the next session anyway.  At this session, Sean turns the tables, by telling Will essentially what Will told the arrogant Harvard student at the bar, but on a deeper level.  Sean tells Will that he's just boy, whose only experience in life comes from reading books.  Sean points out that while Will may be able to talk all about art, war, love, grief, and other aspects of life, he's never actually experienced any of it.  He doesn't know what it ""smells like inside the Sistine Chapel"", or what it's like to be in a war and to hold ""your best friend's head in your lap and watch him draw his last breath, looking to you for help.""  Will doesn't know what it's like to truly love, nor to grieve for the death that of love.  This revelation has the effect of instilling in Will a respect for Sean's intelligence and character, allowing him to finally start opening up to someone, and marking a turning point in the movie.
Robin William's monologue in this scene is probably one of the best pieces of writing Hollywood has come up with in recent years, not for its sappiness, but for its depth, truth, and honesty, and for the clever way that it turns Will's own thoughts against him.
So, for these two scenes alone I give this movie 5 stars.  There are plenty of other funny and clever scenes that fill the gaps and complete the movie, but these are the most important two, and the ones that make it a must-see.",1085616000,15,4068,4.741843971631206
87742,5,0788814664,"""Good Will Hunting"", starring Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Robin Williams, and Minnie Driver, is one of the top ten greatest films of 1997.  It was nominated for nine Oscars, including Best Picture, going on to win two: Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (Williams).  The plot, written by Damon and Affleck, is brilliant.  It wonderfully despicts the dramatic side of recovery while adding some interesting wit in the perfect scenes.  However, the wit never interrupts or overlaps the dramatic events.  Director Gus Van Zant leads the cast and crew to accomplish this masterpiece beautifully.  The chain of events always contain the perfect emotional background that keeps audiences watching closely.  It later becomes more than just a secret math genius recovering from a painful childhood.  The other plots combined with it offers a deeper understanding behind the main plots, namely the therapist's reflecting his wife's death and Will Hunting falling in love.  Such level of drama keeps the intensity intact in the raging scenes.  Unfortunately, Damon and Affleck have yet to release their follow-up screenplay.
Matt Damon and Minnie Driver earned an Oscar nomination for their performances (Best Actor/ Best Supporting Actress).  Damon seemed made for that role.  As with Robin Williams, they desplict their character's emotions and turbulances to the fullest, offering audiences a more emotional feel.  Williams proves that he's capable of performing dramatic films as well as his signature comedy.  All other actors also desplict their presence wonderfully.

87743,5,0788814664,"As close as a film comes to thrilling, moving, complete entertainment.
The taut screenplay keeps you riveted as events unfold. Despite it's straightforward thematic backbone, Good Will Hunting does an impressive job playing out complex emotional negotiations between lover and friend, eager professional mentor and unwilling father figure, with the bitterness any hardworking career academic like the professor must inevitably feel in the face of a genetic miracle who'd rather chase girls than gunk around with theorems and formulas.
On the negative side, some characters may come across as cardboard (an arrogant MIT professor; a humble-by-choice psychologist who turns out to be The Most Effective; an unsung math prodigy from the wrong side of Boston who never really saw the face of school but can recite page numbers from economics books; etc) but all of it is executed with such magnificent grace, style and heartfelt emotional realism that it has moved me every single time I have watched it (5 times).
Special mention for the fabulous cameos from Robin Williams in a rare subdued but effective performance sans his usual comedic histrionics, and Minnie Driver, who is simply stunning in her role as Mr. Precocious' love interest.

87744,4,0788814664,"It's hard to view ""Good Will Hunting"" without a certain detachment. After all, two young actor punks won Oscars for their screenplay - and considering this is a vanity project in the purest sense (they wrote it to give themselves some great roles), there's a strong urge to analyze the film rather than just watch it.
But try to watch it and you'll see how strong it really is. Affleck and Damon have written an intelligent and engaging movie with some exceptionally moving and real moments. Williams is outstanding - few actors could deliver his key lines (and key silences) with the understated conviction he brings. Damon and Affleck, and their buddies, transcend the vanity project tag and really embody their characters. You're with them. You care about them. And so when the movie completes its rather conventional arc, you're happy that everything went pretty much the way you thought it would.
Directed with an extremely perceptive and sensitive touch by Gus Van Sant, ""Good Will Hunting"" breaks no new ground, but it's not supposed to. It's an effective, simple, engaging character study with sharp performances. To add ""and nothing more"" to that sentence would be a travesty, since it's a rare movie that offers even that much.

Matt Damon is good as Will Hunting, a mathematical-genius janitor, but Robin Williams gives the all-star performance as Sean McGuire, the psychologist who helps him. While there is a lot of bad language and sexual dialogue, the meat of the plot is absolutely superb, shown by the Academy Award given to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck for writing the screenplay.

The movies is about a boy named Will (Matt Damon) who with his friends, drinks, goes in and out of jobs, and tends to get in a fair amount of trouble. After he goes to jail he is let out on two conditions: he continues to educate himself and he sees a psychiatrist (Robim Williams). From there the movie takes off as both Williams and Damon begin to hatch away at the parts of their lives that have deeply affected them both.
The acting is superb and the overall feeling by the time the movie is over is just amazing. Like I said I'm not one to get emotional over a movie but by the time this one is over you can't help but to crack a smile.",1081468800,2,918,4.021857923497268
87747,3,0788814664,"In a way, this is the typical, cliched, conventional awe-inspiring movie that the Oscar Academy loves so much. It has most of its elements, indeed, still director Gus Van Sant is able to make it work without falling into some easy traps and melodramatic common-places.
Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, apparently a young loser who hasn`t a bright future ahead of him. Yet, as he soon discovers, Will is in fact a bright, highly gifted youngster with an uncommon talent to maths. The plot is rich enough to showcase his growing process and further development, even if occasional predictable scenes unfold.
Van Sant suceeds in delivering an enticing and poignant story about self-discovery, isolation, friendship and communication, yet it seems to gets dangerously close to Hollywood fluff in a couple of moments (just close, as it never becomes truly cutesy or embarassing).
The acting also helps a little to make the effort work, since besides Damon it includes convincing performances from Robbin Williams, Minnie Driver and Ben and Casey Affleck. The soundtrack is a plus, too, including Danny Elfman and indie talents like Elliot Smith, the Dandy Warhols or Luscious Jackson.
""Good Will Hunting"" is a solid, consistent movie worth watching, yet it is far from being a milestone or a work of genius. It`s basically a good, well-told story with engaging elements.

87748,5,0788814664,"First things first - this must be one of the greatest movies in recent Hollywood history. Like all truly great movies, this one is built multi-dimensionally, with an intelligent large-scale development (global movie structure, several parallel stories between main characters, excellent dialogs in major scenes), while at the same time realizing that beauty lies in the detail (shading of supporting characters and interactions between them, witty dialogs in 'smaller' scenes which are not directly related to the main plot, music which beautifully underlines the plot and the characters). With respect to supporting roles, I can only think of one other movie where they are portrayed with more texture and depth, Heat by M. Mann. In Good Will Hunting there are several different, but connected plots developing at the same time on multiple levels, and it feels like every single one of those plots could make a solid movie on its own. On the highest level there are relationships between Will and his girlfriend, between Will and his best buddy, and Will and his tutor No. 1 (Sean). Then, on the next lower level, we have parallel stories between Will and his tutor No. 2 (Math Prof Gerald), and between Sean and Gerald (actually this one is my favorite sub-plot in the whole movie). Going even further down, you can find small pearls, for example those beautiful sketch roles of Will's two other buddies, Billy and Morgan, or the stereotypical pairing of extrovert math professor with his introvert Russian assistant.
What I absolutely love about this movie are the dialogs. There are some heavy artillery dialog scenes: Sean telling Will he doesn't know a first thing about his life as an orphan just because he read Oliver Twist, Sean telling Will it's not about his girlfriend being perfect or him being perfect but it's about being perfect for each other, Skylar asking Will why is he afraid to come with her to California, Chuckie telling Will 'you don't owe it to yourself - you owe it to me', Sean asking Gerald why he's still so f...g afraid of failure, Sean telling Will it's not his fault... And then there are those beautiful 'side-dish' dialogs: Prof. Gerald trying to find Will in the workshop and talking to those two men who basically tell him to piss off, funny 'pickled' kiss between Will and Skylar on their first date, Gerald asking Sean to become a counselor for Will and Sean replying with 'How many shrinks did you go to before me? Barry? Henry? Not Rick!'
For lot of people the story is not realistic enough (kid with mind of a genius, knowing everything about everything) and/or too stereotypical (poor kid making it big by listening to his heart). All I can say is: a) the story is not trying to be very realistic, it is also symbolic and abstract, and b) every novel, poem, movie or song in the last five thousand years is basically about same things: love and money. But we still like them because the same old story is (almost) always presented in a different way, there's always a new angle. I mean, the story is ancient, so it's not so much about what the story is about, it's much more about how the story is told. And this story is told in a way that every young person out there, no matter how intelligent or how talented he or she might be, can get inspired to go Good Will Hunting!
As I already said - this is a very, very good movie. But it's not 100 percent perfect. And that's a good thing. There's a line near the end of the movie, when Sean is telling Will his counseling is finished and asks him if he would like to see his file. Will asks Sean if he's had any personal experience with child abuse and Sean replies 'yes, my father was an alcoholic, mean f...g drunk.' I think that's a bit too much, I mean, it makes Sean a perfect counselor (his wife dying of cancer, holding his dying friend in Vietnam, smelling the paint in the Sistine Chapel, etc). That's the only real misperfection I can find in the movie... and that makes it perfect. Look at us, we're all imperfect, we all have our own little peccadilloes. And that's exactly why we're perfect for each other. And that's probably why this movie is perfect for myself.",1077926400,5,4169,4.64276048714479

Dr. Lambeau discovers Will Hunting (Matt Damon), the janitor, solving a second more difficult problem, which leads Dr. Lambeau to pursue the unique talent of Will.  Will has unmatched intellectual aptitude and a severe cynical view of the world that leads him to escape the world with his friends while breaking the law.

As Will begins to see Dr. Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), Sean faces a his own troubles through Will.

87751,5,0788814664,"Good Will Hunting may be the best movie I have ever seen. I have said that for years, and I mean it. It has a great script, brilliant acting (even though Ben Affleck is in it), and great direction. There are few movies that can get by on mostly dialogue alone. Kevin Smith's movies can do that. He was a producer on this movie, by the way. But, most movies that make 100 million are special effects flicks that cost almost that much to make. This movie is different.
This is a story about Will Hunting (Matt Damon). He is a genius. In every sense of the word. He knows more about math than most people can imagine. He is only 20 and spends most of his time getting drunk with his buddies and getting into trouble. One day while working as a janitor at a prestigous college, he solves a math problem that the profressor (Stellen Skarsgard) has put on a chalk board in the hallway & is hoping that one of his students can solve it by the end of the semester. Will then solves it while he mopping the hallway. Then the profressor puts up another problem, and while Will is in the middle of solving it, he gets caught. Then he runs off, quits the job, goes & gets drunk with his buddies, gets into a fight, & assaults an officer. That math professor then comes to bail him out, but only on one condition. Will has to work with him on math & he wants will to be his prodigy, in a way. By court order, Will also has to see a pychology professor. And this is where the movie really kicks in.
Robin Williams plays the psychology professor. He and Will don't really get along at first, but Will likes him. They eventually end up trusting each other and form a very good friendship. This is where the core of the movie lies. The dialogue between the two is amazing. They bounce & play of each other perfectly. The professor is trying to get Will to open up about his problems he has had and make him a better person. All the while trying to hold the math professor at bay and let Will make up his own mind. Will is a troubled youth. He is a genius and he knows it, but he wastes it and hides behind it. He evetually meets a nice girl (Minnie Driver), but he pushes her away eventually, as well. The only people he doesn't try to push away are his three best friends (Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck & Cole Hauser). They don't challenge him, but he likes them around.
I was shocked when I watched this and then thought about the fact that Damon & Affleck wrote this movie. I couldn't believe it. And it's clear who is the better actor of the two, as well. Damon shines in his first lead role & this is the movie that got him noticed. Affleck was a no-name at the time and between this & 'Chasing Amy'(Kevin Smith movie) he is now who he is today. Robin Williams recieved a much deserved 'Best Supporting Actor' award for this. He is abosolutely amazing. Basically, when this came out, I wasn't too hyped to go see it. After I saw it the first time, my jaw was on the floor. This is an amazing movie that everyone should take the time to see. It's worth every penny you pay for it and it's a movie you and your girlfriend (or even buddies) can watch.
The special features are pretty decent. Most of it came from the laserdisc. You get a commentary track from director Gus Van Sant, Matt Damon, & Ben Affleck. There are 11 deleted scenes, a production featurette, trailer, tv commercials, a music video, & some behind the scenes footage. Not bad, but I would have liked a better featurette. Basically if not for the commentary & the deleted scenes, the supplements wouldn't be very good.",1075248000,2,3569,4.273264401772526

Robin Williams, who plays his shrink, is beautiful in this role. He does not just play the listener but has got under the skin of the character and given him more depth. With the death of his wife and rivalry with the college mate, he has done well to create a much more challenging role.
Ben Affleck is not really my favourite person, and I don't think we can say he is a good actor, but he has his moments. Going hand in hand with Matt in writing this was his best decision. He has a moment, lets admit it, when he puts Matt in his place over the job opportunities he is given.

It really captured the essence of what it is to be a human being, something that many films that followed its formula did not quite get.  Matt Damon's acting here is so natural, one really feels that he lived the role through his imagination many times.  His and Afleck's creativity, therefore, not rendered through a director's mindset, simply shines in its authenticity.  Williams, free from the comic constraints, gives a memorable performance of a learning mentor, who does not have all the answers, but sincerely tries.  Minnie Driver is, as usual, just excellent.

87759,5,0788814664,"This film was better than Titanic and better than As Good As It Gets, all three nominated for Best Picture in 1997.  I am incredibly glad that it did win for Best Original Screenplay.  A monologue performed by Robin Williams' character is probably the best monologues in a film ever written.  I was amazed.  It was so touching and so real.  After watching this movie just once, it has already proved itself to be one of my favorite movies of all time.
Surprisingly, I do have one disclaimer for all of those families looking for movies like this one to watch with their families.  You know, movies that sort of have a theme like ""life is tough but somehow, you'll make it through.""  This is similar, but trust me, it is not a family film.  It has language every five seconds and a lot of sex-related dialogue and humor.  This does not obstruct, however, the amazing script all together.  If you're looking for a powerhouse film without being over the top, this one's it.
The acting in this movie is also superior, namely Matt Damon.  This is his first movie to really get people's attention.  He even received an Oscar nomination for his leading  role, and deservadly so.  It really amazed me how he seemed so perfect (he is a genius after all) but on the inside, he was struggling.  And slowly, as these defense mechanisms start coming into play, he unravels and to have someone reveal their inner being like this so perfectly really establishes them as an amazing actor.  Robin Williams was also in this film and he also did very well, receiving his first Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor.  Also nominated was Minnie Driver, playing Damon's girlfriend in the movie.  She had this arguement with Damon towards the end of the film and it allowed her to shine.  She was so raw, so real.  She blew me away.  Before Good Will Hunting I had never seen her in anything very high quality.  Thankgoodness for this movie!
Bottom Line: Although not a family film (trust me), this movie establishes itself to be one of the best all around movies of recent years.  (I give it an A+ and it is number one on my all time favorite movies list)",1064620800,4,2131,4.520942408376963

My favorite scene is when Robin Williams-Will's therapist- breaks through to Will's vulnerable emotions.  ""It's not your fault"", he says.  A very hard scene to do, for he had to say that line about seven times in a row-and yet he had to be believable.  And he was!
Great acting!
Damon and Affleck are great actors in it-and bravo to their hidden writing talents.  Minnie Driver was charming, all good roles in this film

87761,5,0788814664,"Like everybody else, I appreciate knowing in advance if a film is poor so I can avoid it. However, I prefer to ""discover"" an especially enjoyable film rather than know much about it in advance. That was true of this film as well as of two others, My Big Fat Greek Wedding and Bend It Like Beckham. Although I consider none of them a ""great"" film, I thoroughly enjoyed all three but for different reasons.
Directed by Gus Van Sant and co-starring Matt Damon (Will Hunting) and Minnie Driver (Skylar), with Robin Williams (Sean McGuire) and Stellan Skarsgard (Professor Lambeau) cast in important supporting roles, Good Will Hunting has three separate but related plot lines which involve Will Hunting's emergence as a genius in the field of mathematics, his romantic relationship with Skylar, and his patient-therapist relationship with McGuire. The most dramatic moments in the film occur when ""baggage"" from Hunting's or McGuire's past is opened up in the present as decisions must be made about the future. The exteriors in and around Boston are lovely, an area in which I lived for many years. There is also a great deal of humor in the script, co-authored by Damon and Ben Affleck who plays Will's closest friend, Chuckie. (They received an Academy Award for best original screenplay.) This film offers several ""feel better"" benefits but for me, its ultimate appeal is based on Damon's performance as a troubled young man who, ""with a little help from his friends,"" can eventually chart a new course for his life. More often than not, Robin Williams is either miscast or out of control. His contributions in this film, however, are substantial and impressive.

87763,4,0788814664,"Anyone who remembers Drugstore Cowboy, My Own Private Idaho or To Die For will remember when Gus Van Sant was hailed as the next big thing on the indie scene.  So is it any surprise that when his first big commercial success met with equal amounts of derision as with praise?  In many ways you can see it from both sides.  Good Will Hunting, scripted by best pals in real life as well as on screen Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, is the story of a mathematical genius orphaned caretaker who needs a little professional guidance (or Robin Williams) to put him on the straight path towards happiness.
Admitedly the story may make fans of Van Sant's more original work cringe, but there really is something uplifting here.  Matt Damon is perfectly cast as Will Hunting, proving as he did in The Talented Mr. Ripley, that he's much more than just a pretty face.  Robin Williams is good also, being much better in serious roles such as this than in something like Patch Adams.  Minnie Driver is fine, although it's the obvious chemistry between her and her co-star that really interests.  Ben Affleck plays the knockaround good guy of Chasing Amy, the only kind of role in which he seems really comfortable in.
What's most surprising about the movie though is that aside from it's sweet and sickly message of 'follow your heart' there is more to it.  One scene in particular, where Williams and Damon face it off in a discussion of real life versus intellectualism is not only well observed but also well acted by both parties.  On top of this, the romance between Damon and Driver is sparky and believable (for obvious reasons), ensuring that you really care when Will's personal demons start impinging on the relationship.  Of course, this is the kind of movie that a lot of people will feel compelled to say that they don't like because on many levels it is a little obvious.  However, that certainly isn't to say that it isn't affecting in its way, and if parts come across as clichd then it's a small price to pay for one of the better Hollywood melodramas to come from the 90's.  Unfortunately, Gus Van Sant then managed to go downhill with his pointless remake of Psycho and then his virtual replication of Good Will Hunting, Finding Forrester.  In this way maybe we should view Good Will Hunting as his last standout film.",1053216000,2,2321,4.618004866180049

He really got into his role, as well as the rest of them. Good Will Hunting is a very memorable film about a troubled young man with recognizable great potential, with strong friendships that inspire him to be better. This was a great role for all characters. However, if you happen to be someone who takes offense to foul language, you'll want to be prepared to hear a lot of it. Its R rating was well deserved, due to pervasive strong language, some sexual dialogue, and a scene of violence.

87766,5,0788814664,"Rather than restate the plot, I'll counter some arguments about why people didn't like the movie... adding in a few comments why I thought the film was valuable.
First, I give the film points for having characters which praised intelligence.  That includes all Will Huntings hoodlum friends.  I'm sick of these low grade ghetto movies, where the poor inner city kid shuns book learnin' cuz' their going to sell ""crack"" for a living and drive a jacked up BMW.  Example: The scene where Chucky (Will's best friend) tells him ""No offense, but if your still hanging out with me in 20 years, I'm gonna kill ya.... You have something all these guys (construction workers)here would kill for (Wills great intellect).""
Secondly, the film gave great exposure to the field of mathematics, which was the subtle background plot of the movie. You'll note that no mathemeticians publicly decried the movie; so you shouldn't either.  It amounts to good exposure, and implied that you can be ""cool"", but still be smart.  The recent film, ""A Beautiful Mind"" gave even better exposure to the field of mathematics, but unfortunately the characters mental nature sort of took a little bit away from that :-)
Thirdly, criticism is people say that nobody can possibly know so much about so many things (math, chemistry, history).  Nonesense.  It is not at all uncommon for geniuses to have an affinity for books and subjects of all types.  The comment that nobody could be that smart without it being noticed is totally 100 percent bogus.  First off.... everyone noticed.  Who didn't?  All Will's friends knew it.  Also, we live in a world where many people ""slip through the cracks.""  This works both ways.  Usually it means that dumb people manage to make it through classes because teachers cut them some slack... but on not so rare occasions, it works the other way.  There are alot of very smart people in this world who end up being janitors for a living.  Just look into the statistics of the MENSA organizations.  Geniuses come from all backgrounds.  Scholarships to MIT or Caltech aren't just handed to people on a silver platter.  The scholarship fairy doesn't magically show up at your door.... and clearly, as was the whole plot of the movie... will obviously wasn't going out of his way to bring his talent to the right peoples attention.

87767,5,0788814664,"""Good Will Hunting"" was one of the best films in 1997 thanks to a combination of excellent direction, brilliant writing and superb acting to create an engaging drama for the audience to embrace.  Being the first film ever written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, director Gus Van Sant (who also directed ""My Own Private Idaho"" in 1991 and ""To Die For"" in 1995), created a very plausible atmosphere for the unusual story to unfold:
A young genius named Will Hunting (Matt Damon) never attended college, but read mathematical, scientific and literary books on his own for many years.  Severely abused as a child in an adoptive home, Will now prefers to exist as a manual laborer living in a condemned house in a dilapidated Boston neighborhood.  While working as a janitor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) one night, he solves a heretofore unsolvable mathematical problem written on a classroom chalkboard.  The professor who originally transcribed the problem, Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgrd), is shocked to find the problem solved but doesn't know who solved it.  He eventually finds Will, but Will was arrested and jailed for his involvement in a beating while on a night out with his best friend Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck), who is a true manual laborer.  Determined to save Will from himself, Gerald enlists the aid of a former friend & college roommate, Sean Maquire (Robin Williams), who now works as a community college psychology teacher, to provide psychological therapy for Will.  To be released from jail, Will agrees to regular counseling sessions with Sean and to work for Gerald.  The initial therapy sessions between Will and Sean are very intense (more so for Sean than for Will, as Will uses his genius to tear into Sean's core and has had a lot of previous psychotherapy experience), but Sean finds ways to work with him.  Complicating matters, a mutual attraction develops between Will and a female MIT student, Skylar (Minnie Driver).
Though some that watch this film may be disturbed by the violence depicted when Will relentlessly beats a man, it helps to demonstrate how deeply troubled the character is. Other well acted supporting characters in the film include Morgan O'Mally (played by Casey Affleck, Ben Affleck's younger brother) and Billy McBride (played by Cole Hauser).  Ben Affleck did a good job with his portrayal of Will's friend Chuckie.
""Good Will Hunting"" earned Matt Damon and Ben Affleck the Oscar for Best Writing for a Screenplay and Robin Williams won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  Other Oscar nominations received include Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Original Music, Best Song, Matt Damon for Best Actor, Minnie Driver for Best Supporting Actress and Gus Van Sant for Best Director.  Overall, I give ""Good Will Hunting"" a rating of 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys a well-acted, gripping, psychological drama.",1046131200,43,2916,5.039501039501039

Robin Williams, the therapist, while helping Will, also takes a long hard look at his own life and while the movie focuses mainly on developing the relationship between Damon and Williams, there are also other interesting interactions. Minnie Driver (the girlfriend) and Ben Affleck (the best friend) deliver magnificent back-up performances.  This movie is thought provoking and sometimes disturbing, but very real.

What is so amazing and so remarkable about the film is that it was the handywork and dreamchild of two relatively unknown (at least up until then) actors and screenwriters in the persons of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, boyhood friends and denizens of the greater Boston area.
Add to this superb screenplay the support of wonderful actors like Robin Williams, who won a best supporting actor oscar for his role as the psychiatrist who unlocks the secrets to the protagonist (Will Hunting)and allows him to grow and mature. Minnie Driver is also excellent as the love interest drawing Will Hunting toward his beckoning adulthood. She is also the occasion for the single best line in the film; ""You like apples? I got her phone number! How do you like them apples?"" This film works so well on so many levels that it is really a shame that it lost the Oscar for best picture to ""Shakespeare In Love"", for this is a far more powerful, enduring, and worthwhile film experience. if you haven't seen it, I recommend you RUN to the nearest video store and rent it.

87777,5,0788814664,"""GOOD WILL HUNTING"" is a brilliant uplifting movie about a guy, Will Hunting(Matt Damon), who is smarter than anyone in the nearby college and could easily get a diploma. Two problems, he doesn't like to show his intellegence, and he doesn't attend the college, he cleans its floors.
But soon, Will is seeked out by a college professer, who bails him out of assault charges on two conditions: 1. Will must have math sessions with the professer 2. He must see a sichiatrist once a week.
Will goes through 5 of the sichiatrists before he meets Sean(Robin Williams). After 3 or 4 sessions they become close and share thier pasts and thoughts.
Then suddenly, Sean and the professer have a violent argument. The professer thinks Will should seek a career in Math, but Sean thinks they should let him choose.
All the meanwhile, you're informed of his life outside these happenings. What's great is that everytime he goes out with his friends(Ben Affleck is one of them)or his girlfriend(Minnie Driver), the scenes are fairly well-written, because in other movies, these scenes get to the point as fast as they, this movie is NOT slow, but it does an amazing job in taking its own sweet time.
I think that ""GOOD WILL HUNTING"" is a beautifully made drama with 5 star acting(I still think Matt Damon and Minnie Driver deserved Oscars)and plot. An excellent buy. I would reccomend this to anyone.",1023580800,3,1386,4.779166666666667

87779,4,0788814664,"Gus van Sant does a very nice job keeping this movie moving along briskly, something that might not be especially easy given the subject matter. Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, a natural genius with close to perfect recall, who has various relationship issues, and an unpleasant family history. Robin Williams plays Hunting's somewhat unwilling therapist with issues of his own, which Hunting expertly locates and triggers.
The chemistry between Williams and Damon *works* - the various power plays and tests seem very real, and felt deeply by both actors. The friendship between Ben Afleck and Damon is easy and familiar, which isn't surprising given that they grew up together. Damon and Minnie Driver don't have quite the right electricity between them, but Driver does an excellent job of portraying the slightly eccentric Skylar.
Van Sant's direction is outstanding, and resembles his work in ""My Own Private Idaho"" in bits, but has a maturity not as well-developed ten years ago.

Surrounded by opportunities, Will feels unable to take any of them for one reason or another and gets 'stuck' as a janitor in a prestigious American college.
Everyone ducks when they see Robin Williams with a beard - he's going to be 'sensitive' is he? Well you will be pleased to know he only goes over the top once or twice here and the rest is a fine performance. Top marks to director Gus Van Sant for that.
The film scores where it dares to be different, and conversely, its weakness is where it has to be like other films. There was no need to give Will a girlfriend, except perhaps to give a contrast to his male relationships. It seems unlikely that Minnie Driver's character would have been attracted to him, she would be more likely to tell him off for using long words. But this is a minor niggle, and Driver herself is a good ingredient in the film, even if her character is superfluous to the film's story.
All in all, this is worth watching because Damon and Affleck are doing something different, and, 90% of the time, they achieve it admirably.",1009584000,2,1219,4.398230088495575

I'm not trying to ruin my ""JiggamanSpence-ism"" or anything, but this was the first time since I was a kid that I began to cry during a movie.

He thinks he can help Will Hunting, but there are many scenes where they just sit there and nothing happens. Even in the scenes where they do talk, its a bunch of nonsense anyway. To me, the character played by Matt Deamon was really implausable.  He seems to be genius in many different areas; not only is he a math genius, he can read books with stunning speed and accuracy.  He can read entire pages just in a manner of seconds.  He is also a master psychologist, he can figure out people's psychological dispositions just by having one converstion with them.  He is also a expert historian.  Did I mention that his character can levitate in the air?  Oh, I'm sorry, he can't do that.

Considering the brouhaha this film earned from the critics and awards circles, nevermind all the attention young authors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck earned over the saga they underwent to see the film get made, you would think this DVD would be packed with some of that behind-the-scenes stuff.  Not to say the DVD is bare--by no means.  A rare, telling video of Oscar-nominated songwriter, Elliot Smith, singing ""Miss Misery"" was worth the extra money for the edition.  However, to be a ""collector's"" incentive item, it doesn't have much more to it.
The film itself is clearly transfered, though I would have liked the sound to have been cleaned up a bit.  Some of the bar scenes have just never sounded clear no matter what, and the dialogue gets muddled in the mix.
Storywise, if you don't know the tale of the M.I.T. janitor genius wonderboy and his gang of average joe hooligans, then you've had your head in the sand since 1997.  Without getting into it further, I will tell you the story is a moving one, and though heavily peppered with foul language, even younger teens will benefit from seeing the struggle of someone so bright yet so crippled.  Universal truths will be seen widely by all who see the story.
This Oscar winning film deserved more on its disc.  A commentary with director Gus Van Zant and the writing duo is included, which sounds like three guys hanging out with a pizza and a six pack--laid back--just like the story.
This edition isn't much costlier than the other ""regular"" version.  This is a good enough film which you can easily tell yourself it is worth the extra cash, but don't expect to be too fulfilled by the extras.",999216000,5,1709,4.67
87788,4,0788814664,"It is a set of circumstances I'm sure that makes this movie click for me; hit me very deeply, softly. I've run into many people who I respect who find this film cheesy or manipulative, which just goes to show that so much of our tastes and likes and loves are so particular. One detail here or there can send us in opposite directions.
The first time I saw it I thought I loved it because of Minnie Driver, I've always had a warm crush on her. And her character is so appealing, so likable, lovable, the kind of woman you hope to meet in college and start the second chapter of your life with and you hope it'll be a long, lush chapter two.
The second time I watched it was several years later and I watched it just before I moved to San Francisco and I thought, ""A-ha! really i am so touched by this movie because I identify with Will Hunting: his quickness, his alienation and stretch between different worlds and just like me he's heading west.""
But, by the time I was done watching it I realized why I had loved it all along, because Robin Williams is a father and mentor that I've never had but so desperately, dearly want. ""it's not your fault, it's not your fault, it's not your fault"" they don't seem alive on the page, they seem like they might even be cheesy or maudlin, but when they come out of Robin's mouth in his room there...well, they work, they are real and good and right and any flaws this film has don't much matter to me, I can take that moment and tuck it away in me for later and it burns as hot and strong as the first time I felt it.",997574400,2,1559,4.148514851485149

Now I know, I know people are saying that if they use all of the profanity, they certainly are not showing their intellect level.

87792,5,0788814664,"This is a great movie featuring a young up-and-coming star in Matt Damon.  Damon is one of those very few good-looking, youthful male actors who has a credible screen presence and can actually act!  In that way, he might be the antithesis of Keanu Reeves.  Anyway, aside from Damon, we also get Robin Williams in perhaps his greatest mentor role since ""Dead Poets Society.""
Damon plays a precocious (to say the least) adolescent, Will, who possesses an intellect that is advanced far beyond his modest age.  Williams portrays a psychologist who is trying to steer Damon in the right direction.  As intelligent as our Good Will is, it becomes readily apparent that his emotional state needs help to catch up to his mental prowess.
In the meantime, there is an MIT mathematics professor (played by Stellan Skarsgrd) who is a kind of  counter-balance to Williams' character.  Here is a brilliant, accomplished pedagogue who teaches at one of the most prestigious academic institutions on the planet.  He's a man who has earned the Fields Medal (Mathematicians version of the Nobel Prize) and is used to looking at people with an aloof air of superiority.  Enter Will, and all of a sudden he is humbled, realizing that his cerebral aptitude is dwarfed by this youth who seems to have come out of nowhere.  Throughout the movie, the mathematician & the psychologist play this game of tug-of-war, attempting to pull poor Will in two different directions.
The scene in the bar where Will shows-up the snobby Harvard sociology student is an absolute all-time classic.  And I mean a classic of ALL movie history.  It is especially hilarious & poignant as all of us have known people like the Harvard snob.  Although the rest of the movie is well-worth seeing, this scene by itself is worth the price of renting (or even buying) this DVD.
The one flaw in this movie is that the script is a bit weak @ times.  They seem to rely on the ""F"" word too much for dramatic effect.  Now, I have no problem with them using the ""F"" word.  It's just that it gets a bit redundant after the 500th time.  However, as flaws of movies go, this is very mild.

Either they don't believe lowbrow individuals such as the Southies exist, or they wish they keep the hell away from them.  I like movies/art that creates controversy and forces viewers to deal with unresolved personal issues.  GWH is one of these films. Profanity is used to define the world they live in manifesting frustration felt knowing they will be in the ""same"" place 50 years from now!?  Profanity is common among poor people, especially males needing to ""prove something.""  Who doesn't know this?  However, I did not like GWH for the first 1-hour 45-minutes because I couldn't relate to any of the characters.  But the last meeting between Williams and Damon found relevance within me.  To quote the Bible: Iron sharpeneth iron, so does a man the countenance of his friend.  This metaphor uses the analogy of metals rubbing against one another to achieve sharpness like the awakenings in the professor/therapist/patient/best friend. Even viewers are sharpened by GWH, especially those who hated everything about this film.  You can say they were ""rubbed the wrong way,"" and now have to resolve whatever inside them that bristled against this movie, or allow it to fester and continuously cloud objectivity necessary to really enjoy any art. GWH redeems itself by ending predictably by way of a very interesting screenplay associating memorable interpersonal communications that anyone able to finish the movie should find enlightening.  Williams telling Damon ""It's not your fault,"" is appropriate as the key that unlocks the pain that has come to the surface.  Some viewers are bothered by this seemingly trivial approach to psychoanalysis.  But this is the point: after hours/days/months/years of analysis, it is always just one thing (that repetitive clause) among everything else that works finally as a catalyst and constitutes the bridge that allows the patient to cross over into wellness.

Given the benefit of hindsight, it would seem like a no-brainer to let Ben and Matt try their hands at writing a buddy movie with lots of male bonding and weepy emotion.  But coming from two unknown commodities, it really is a startling achievement.
Their script goes down several paths that seasoned scriptwriters don't dare tread, for if they are not done perfectly they tend to collapse like a house of cards on a waterbed.
First, we get the working class buddies.  Affleck, his brother Casey, Cole Hauser, and Damon have wonderful and believable chemistry together as a bunch of South Boston wiseguys.  We see them cruising for burgers and chicks, picking fights, and going to work, with a habit of ease obviously built over years and years.  Later on, someone says of Affleck's character's relationship with Damon's: ""Chuckie's family, he'd lie down in...traffic for you.""  The line becomes superfluous, a validation of things we've already seen for ourselves.
Second, we get the tortured genius/prodigy.  The credit here must be split in two places.  First, the script takes great pains in its authenticity.  Apparently the theorems that Will solves are as complex as portrayed, and are solved in the appropriate manner.  Most movie portrayals of genius tend to fudge that part of the equation, hoping that the audience is dumb enough to not recognize that the guitar virtuoso is not really playing the song (a problem that I found distracting in Woody Allen's ""Sweet and Lowdown"") or that the great writer's words are not up to snuff (as is the problem in director Van Sant's later film ""Finding Forrester"").  Second, Damon himself does a wonderful job in showing both the ease at which this math comes to him, and the coiled frustration that it burdens him with.
Third, we get the mentors.  Stellan Skarsgard, as the mathematician who discovers Will, could have easily settled for being a two-dimensional villain.  But his Prof. Lambeau is believably flawed, and his displaced ambition never becomes cartoonish or unredeemably destructive.  Robin Williams, as the psychologist Will is court-ordered to see, manages nary a moment of his patented over-the-top showmanship.  Rather, his Sean is reserved, anguished, and powerful, but always in very subtle ways.  Williams does his best work portraying Sean's grief, calling it up in a matter-of-fact way until it needs to boil over and lash out to protect itself, as it does in his first scene with Will.  Their relationship ends up strengthening over time, culminating in one final scene of catharsis that if portrayed by lesser actors with a lesser script, would come across as schmaltzy, but here is very real and very moving.
Fourth, we get the girl.  I remember when this movie first came out, Minnie Driver's character took a lot of flak for throwing herself so shamelessly at Will, who obviously wasn't capable at giving her anything back.  On looking at the movie again, it is astounding to me that this act of courage could be criticized so.  Her Skylar -- Driver does a wonderful job at portraying her joie de vivre, as well as her self-consciousness -- is set up for life, both in her education and in her finances, so she doesn't really need a hardship case like Will.  And yet she loves him, and repeatedly tells him so, knowing full well that he's not going to say it back.  Sure, for the most part it's borderline masochistic, and she puts herself through a needless amount of torture, but wouldn't an easier road be less satisfying?  And wouldn't a less complex character for boy genius Will to be confronted with just become easy prey?  Yes and yes, I say.
These four items, combined with its flair for solid and sometimes flashy dialogue (""How do you like them apples?""), make up a wonderful film.  It makes good on all its promises, and manages to be entertaining, emotional, and assuredly worthwhile.",982627200,14,3949,4.902255639097745

The movie they wrote is one of the most original to come along in a while.  The movie takes place in Boston and focuses on relationships in the life of Will Hunting (Matt Damon).  Will is a janitor at MIT, but he isn't your ordinary janitor.  Will is actually a math genius.  When a Professor Lambeau (Stellan Stalksgaard) puts an virtual impossible problem on a board in the hallway for his students to work on during the year.  Will figures the problem in a matter of days, Lambeau catches him working on it and finds out who he is.  Will spends his spare time drinking with his buddies including his best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck).  They get into a brawl on a basketball court and Will gets thrown in jail.  He has a prior record and is facing time, but Lambeau offers him a chance out if he works with him on math theories.  Will reluctantly agrees, but as part of his probation, he must see a psychiatrist.  Lambeau sends him to his college roommate, Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), who teaches at small Bunker Hill College.  Will is at first distant and dismisses Sean.  He meets a college student, Sklyer (Minnie Driver), in a bar and they start a romance.  Eventual Sean starts to break through to Will as they both have alot in common and Sean isn't after Will's genius.  Will eventually confronts his demons and the movie ends on an interesting note.  All the actors in the film give first rate performances.  Mr. Williams gives the performance of his career and he won the 1997 Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Director Gus Van Zant does a great job of capturing the atmosphere of South Boston. Mr. Damon & Mr. Affleck took home the Oscar for best original screenplay.

Luckily this movie has great bonus features including my favorite, audio commentary with Gus Van Sant, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.  Also included are 11 deleted scenes with audio commentary, production featurette, and ""Miss Misery"" music video.  In other words this DVD is loaded.

The film is very slow and drawn out, trying to make the small plot seem bigger. The script is so poor. The dialoge sounds written, it feels worked out. It rarely sounds natural. Which is a huge pity, because the idea is very interesting.  A lower class boy genius and only one man that can really seem to help him. There was so much room to develope and expand the idea. Yet it never really does so.  Robin Williams was brilliant, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had moments of brilliance. Affleck moreso.  There are some moments where real emotion is shown and it draws us in. But the movie always seem to lose that connection. Not all the characters were expanded like they could have been.

And in the back of his mind lies the memories of being beaten by numerous foster fathers. The therapist Sean (Williams), who has a similar background, manages to reach out to him and their one hour conversations turn out to be a very valuable experience to both of them.
The movie is great and all the actors are good, it's great to see Robin Williams is a more serious role again. He's made some great roles before but also many odd ones in not so very good movies.

87810,5,0788814664,"This is a very intelligent film about Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a young genius, who because of his disadvantaged and abusive childhood, ends up as  a janitor at MIT when he could easily be the head of the Mathematics  department.  Though the story is a bit far fetched (it is hard to believe a  kid this bright wouldn't have been noticed by someone who would have guided  him towards higher education), once you put that aside, it is a fascinating  character study of a very complex and dynamic young man.
Will is  discovered after solving a math challenge left on a blackboard by the head  of the math department at MIT.  This throws his life into turmoil, as the  mathematicians want to make him into a prodigy.  He also begins seeing a  therapist (Robin Williams) who forces him to confront many deep emotions  and experiences he had been repressing.  The effect this has on him, and  his relationship with his friends is powerful and makes for an engrossing  tale.
The screenplay was written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon for  which they won an Academy Award (the film was nominated for nine).  Both  were considered promising young actors before this film, but this tied a  rocket pack to their backs and lit the fuse.  Damon was outstanding in the  lead.  He had a very complex character to play and his emotional range was  phenomenal.  Not only was he quick witted, charming and vibrant, but he  also had to be hot headed, arrogant, confused and despondent.  He was able  to switch emotions with ease and was always intense and believable.  Robin  Williams also gave one of his better performances and received a best  supporting Oscar.
It is hard not to like this film.  Most of the  challenges that Will faced were inside him, and watching him struggle to  overcome the limitations from his past was very uplifting.  I rated this  film a 9/10.  We need more scripts like this.  Perhaps if we are lucky,  Damon and Affleck will take time from their successful acting careers and  collaborate again.",967939200,9,2007,4.671469740634006

This is the movie that finally gave Robin Williams a  well-deserved Oscar.  This movie also introduced American audiences to the  beautiful and talented Minnie Driver.  Now for the bad.  This movie paved  the way for Affleck to make Armaggedon and Forces of Nature.  Williams gave  a boring performance in the movie (watch his small role in Dead Again with  Kenneth Brannagh, it's the best of his career, plus his Oscar should have  been for What Dreams May Come.)  Also, Driver appears to have dropped off  the radar after this movie.
Ok, the plot of a genius janitor at one of  the most prestigious universities in America but who doesn't truly have the  ambition is most definitely unique.  However, the movie is too long, too  boring and too profane.  I can watch almost anything without being bothered  by the mere f-word and this movie was too much even for me.  All this movie  is is Damon getting mad at people for pushing his intellect, Damon and  Affleck fighting everyone they run into, and Damon and Driver fighting  before they realize they're in love.

87820,5,0788814664,"This film from director Gus Van Sant is more to die for than was his previous film, To Die For. I'm speaking of course about the one and only Good Will Hunting.  Matt Damon is Will Hunting. A janitor at MIT, he is a  man of brains, brawn and misdirection. One day while mopping the floors of  this ""bastion of knowledge"", he discovers a contest in which a  student is required to proof a formula of finite mathematics. The story  takes a serious turn when this well- kept- secret of a genius is discovered  by one of the top professors in the university. The trouble with Will, is  that he has no desire to go around boasting  genius as do many of his  counterparts at the university. One day however, Hunting is forced to face  himself, for as he is thrown in jail, his only way out is through the  caring of the professor who discovered him. Now, Will has to make decisions  and think about painful subjects he never dared to face. As a condition of  his release, he must attend therapy in order to satisfy the requests of the  state. This would in the most unlikely way, change his life forever. Meet  Dr. Sean Maguire, a congenial but very direct shrink whom Will is assigned  to fulfill his therapy requirements with. But beyond the psychobabble and  bureaucratic intricacies of the state, the relationship between Hunting and  Maguire is one of pivotal proportions. It turns out Will Hunting and Sean  Maguire are both men holding back many a bottles full of anger and fistfuls  of pain. As the film progresses, the messages of life's challenges and  hurtles become crystal clear. There are more important things in life than  the everyday jumbles of feelings we get caught up in. And the only way to  discover them is to let go and take a chance. This is a genuine film about  release from our personal demons. In the end, Dr. Maguire and Mr. Hunting  help each other tear the other's walls of fear. Take it from me folks,  there is nothing more refreshing than seeing a film about battle-scarred  individuals venting their frustrations on one another in order to rise to a  higher lever of peace. This is a penetrating and lighthearted film which  surprises the viewer with its hilariously touching humor around every  corner. With a script that sounds so naturally spoken by the characters,  you would think this film was more about two ordinary people just sitting  around talking rather than delivering a written and rehearsed dialogue.  With its buffoonery, sensitivity and healing of the mind, Good Will Hunting  reinforces the idea that an uncommon story about an everyday hero is the  best way to evoke an audience response. This film is not only one of the  most effective I have ever seen, but it is one that should let us all know  that the things that are most common among the educated and uneducated  classes is,  we are all people with great capacities and with geniuses  hidden in both of our societies. Matt Damon is no doubt another addition to  the short but illustrious list of actors who are not just pretty faces, but  can also render a character at awe-inspiring levels. Robin Williams  delivers his greatest serious role since Awakenings.

87823,5,0788814664,"There were few films in 1997 that enjoyed more publicity than Good Will Hunting. Most of the hype centered on the two tyro actors who penned the screenplay. It seems that they had been friends for years and in between  college obligations, drinking and socialising, they had been toying with a  script on the side. What started out as a rather average comedy, soon  evolved into a sophisticated drama. In fact, it could hardly  avoid getting  better as Matt Damon and Ben Affleck must have received a ton of brutal  criticism from every Hollywood executive that they approached.

The  true miracle is not that two actors, unknown for writing, could get a  script accepted in Hollywood but that the script was so good that it put  every other effort for the year in the shade. In my opinion, the motion  picture academy was correct in awarding the Oscar for best screenplay to  Good Will Hunting. Everything about the script suggested writers with a  profound understanding of the human condition; even now I half suspect  there was an element of that old saying about an infinite number of monkeys  on typewriters.

For those interested in this Cinderella story  within a movie, you should listen to the director's track on the DVD. It  offers a unique insight into the background of the writing and filming of  Good Will Hunting. It becomes clear from Ben and Matt's reminiscences that  they had a ball during every part of the process. Not only that, they took  advantage of their opportunity, to offer support roles to friends and  family; a situation that rarely occurs outside of independent film.  Surprisingly, one of the best support performances was produced by Casey  Affleck, who is Ben's cousin, (I think).

The script took a bit of  a risk by making the main character a super-genius. Not only is it  difficult to portray a person with such talents but it is nearly impossible  to do so while making him likeable. After all, the tall  poppy syndrome is  strongest when it comes to intellect. We can all aspire to wealth and with  plastic surgery, even beauty is not unattainable but the brains you are  born with is the most you're ever going to have. However, Matt Damon proved  me wrong on both counts.

Will Hunting was undeniably bright. The  scene in the Harvard bar were he takes on an educational supremacist is  worth watching again and again just for the superb timing that was  employed. Will also manages to win our sympathy despite his I.Q. Not so  much because he acts like ""one of the boys"" but because we  discover early on that for every blessing he received in the brain  department, he was given a matching curse in his life. An orphan who was  raised by a series of abusing foster parents is unlikely to have much room  left for pride.

The catalyst which helps Will break out of his  life is Gerald Lambeau, (Stellan Skarsgrd). He is an award winning  mathematician and professor at MIT where Will works as a janitor. Their  paths cross when Will off-handedly solves a difficult maths problem which  Lambeau had set for his post graduate class. But whilst there relationship  is important, it is little more than a subplot; a segue toward Will's  eventual meeting with Sean Maguire, a psychiatrist played by Robin  Williams.

Sean is invited by Lambeau to work with Will. The two  are old friends but even so, Sean was only approached after four other  therapists had been run off by Will's destructive insights and bitter  insults. Sean is a bird of a different feather however. He shares a common  background with Will, and if anything, he has had more pain in his life  than Will may ever see. In a strange way, Sean becomes Will's mother to  Lambeau's role as ambitious father.

The film is rich with detail  and is a wonderful medium for the support actors. Ben Affleck's role as  Will's best friend is not as visible as Matt Damon's but he carries it off  with just the right amount of fatalism and aggression. Will's Lady friend  Skylar, is also worth special mention. Minnie Driver takes a seemingly  token ""love interest"" role and breaths real depth into it.  Without her efforts, Will's final choice would not have rung true and might  have marred the whole film.

Good Will Hunting is a tribute to the  dreams of American youth. Both because two young men managed to reach the  pinnacle of their craft on their first outing but more importantly, because  it deals with one young man's struggle to overcome his troublesome past  while reaching out to grasp life, love and happiness. It's touching,  entertaining and at the same time inspirational.",957657600,248,4590,4.728770595690748

87825,5,0788814664,"_Good Will Hunting_ has much to recommend it, not least of which is its redemptive story of renewal and growth.  The notions that psychotherapy actually produces real results and that men have genuine emotions are  antithetical to most Hollywood films-aside, perhaps, from _The Prince of  Tides_.  This film not only celebrates these unexplored realities, it  manages to do so with style.  This is made possible only by the control  the director exercises over his actors, and the film's  excellent script.  Robin Williams, in particular, is kept wholly within the bounds of his  tightly drawn character-and we are very much enriched by his performance.  And while it might be true that the script might be self-indulgent on the  part of its writers, but the selves that are indulging are fascinating.  The same story told by different writers with a different set of real life  experiences might well have been unlovable, but Affleck and Damon's lives  produced experiences we actually *want* to see.  For me, though, it is the  story of exceeding to the full measure of one's potentials, both  emotionally and professionally, that makes _Good Will Hunting_ a movie to  own.
There are two DVD versions, and their price differential is  minimal enough to make buying the regular version a waste.  No, you should  definitely go for the Collector's Edition, as the bonus materials are  significant and worthwhile.

First,  each one looked at the child genius with sensitivity, doing an excellent  job of focusing on the tenuous aspects of childhood, while attempting to  fathom and apprehend the child's genius.  Two, the films show that these  geniuses are, foremost, human beings who have the same basic, fundamental  needs all humans have--the need for love, contact, undertanding,  friendship, and intimacy.  And three, they show that ultimately, what makes  a human being special is not how smart, talented, or exceptional he is, but  how he conducts his life in relation to his fellow human beings and how  compassionate and caring he is.  Needless to say, these films are exemplars  of their genre.  And Goodwill Hunting is their peer.
Will Hunting is a  genius, not on the order of an MIT student, but on the order of Einstein,  Mozart, Shakespeare.  On the surface, Will comes off as tough, rough, cool.  He is good looking, fast-talking, and seemingly brimming with confidence.  When forced into therapy by court order, Will aviscerates his therapists  with a mixture of brashness, brilliance, and utter lack of respect.  While  being a genius, he is also a miscreant who commits petty thefts and  assaults in his spare time.  He is a strange mix of savant and savage.  Underneath the outward manifestation of his genius, underneath his  rebellious nature and irreverence is a scared kid in need of compassion and  human connection. And that is what Goodwill Hunting is essentially  about--one boy's attempt to make human contact after bearing years of  mental, emotional, and physical abuse.
The genius aspect of Will is  almost ancillary, but is important because it allows another important  message to be sent--great intelligence does not designate a person as  great.  This message is sent home in many ways throughout the movie, but is  most aptly illustrated when Will embarrasses a pompous Harvard boy in a  debate. This scene was definitely one of the most gratifying scenes on  film.
In sum, Goodwill Hunting is a very good film.  It is funny,  humane, uplifting, and touching.  The acting is very strong, the writing is  very good, and the character of Will is complex, smart, snide, vulnerable,  and highly likable.  If you like films that make you feel excited about  being human, then watch this film.  If you want something a bit more  commercial, watch Titanic.",955324800,7,2585,5.016587677725118
87829,5,0788814664,"The angry one star reviews for Good Will Hunting demean the legitimacy of the angry one star reviews for films such as Titanic, which are truly terrible.  Good Will Hunting is not a lavish hollywood blockbuster that  cost 70 million to make and trippled that at the box office.  It did well  and garnered critical praise but it's still a (relatively) art house film  handled well by Van Sant who has constructed good, small, location and  lifestyle specific American movies.
This movie is the same.  I actually  agree with some of the legitimate criticism that this movie is predictable  and over wound up at the end.  The other criticism about how Will shouldn't  be a genius and that the film is generally ""trite"" seems like  silly prejudice.
Take my perspective... I'm a young writer of screenplays  and saw the silly looking trailers for this movie written by two young  guys.  I was sort of furious on the inside that these two were being lauded  as great and I've never seen a Robin Williams movie that wasn't over  sentimental trash.  Then I go to the Angelica in New York, fuming and  ready to hate this movie.  But I couldn't... it was too well done, well  acted by all three of my nemesis and genuinely funny and emotional.  Those  below who say that Matt Damon's performance is bad are one of two things -  without any clue about acting or jealous (and stupid because honestly I'm  jealous yet I think he was great).
In addition, the features here are  definately good for a couple of days watching and paint a vivid picture of  how this film came to be.",954374400,76,1565,4.555956678700361
87830,5,0788814664,"""Good Will Hunting"" is my favourite film of all time.  After seeing this movie while in my final year of high school I was amazed how well it captured adolescencse life.  Many film-makers seem to rely on  hindsight to make a coming of age story.  Damon and Affleck wrote this  script over a period of almost ten years.  As a young man myself I can  honestly say that any parent who is wondering what is going on in their  kids head, watch this movie.  It captures the struggles that all young men  go through.  The collector's DVD is also the best I've seen.  The  commentary by Damon and Affleck is quite intersting to hear.  A classic  film.",954115200,,643,4.3760683760683765
87831,5,0788814664,"It's pleasing to know that every now and then, in a mess ofsuperficiality and mediocrity, we have movies that surprise us and actas stepping stones above the waters of sensationalism, and pointless and generic storylines.
""Good Will Hunting"" was not only a movie that provided you with a well-written script, but also provided you with enough room for imagination to explore your own interpretations of what the writer was saying.  Like a good book that always seemed to be better than the movie, in this case, seeing the movie was like reading a book.  I allowed myself to get to know each and every character, and fortunately enough, I have all of these characters within my peer group.  So to understand the characters was a relatively easy task.
It's a foregone conclusion that the main character's brilliance for mathematics was unparalleled since Ramanujan, according to the ""lowly M.I.T. professor"".  But, I believe Will's brilliance not to be in any particular subject, rather in his ability to attain knowledge from the interpretations of impressionistic paintings to organic chemistry to the analytical diagnostic procedures of the most successful psychiatrists, etc, etc.
At the risk of sounding self-ingratiating, I've never related with a character more than Will Hunting.  And it's not because of the heightened brilliance, but the capacity to appreciate all knowledge, and experiences that I've learned, without having to drop $150,000 on an education.  I, too, enjoy my peer group that may fall in to the interpretation of the ""good, lowly"" professor's judgemental, dehumanizing interpretation; I believe the term he might have used was ""monkees"".
These people provide you with consistent loyalty, never threatening you with bitter insecurities - so that you can go about your business, and socialize with a peer group that you can truly enjoy - for there's nothing to Prove, and there's no necessity to constantly re-establish your friendship with these people.  How many times have you gone into great discussions about art, philosophy, mathematics, and even organic chemistry, and have it turn in to a disorganized quarrel over who can sound more intellectual than the others.
These pursuits that sound noble and productive have proven to be nothing more than intellectual masterbation.  It's only when intellectually-stimulated, can a mind truly grow, regardless of tuition, age, or any other social status.  This movie truly brought out that it's not by your materialistic achievements that one can measure knowledge, but it's by how you could use it to communicate and express yourself.
Like the ""Michael Bolton clone"" in the bar that attempted to intellectually dehumanize and humiliate Chucky with his newfound, overpriced education, the real crime is that he used his knowledge to attempt to hurt somebody, the way a bully in the school yard would use his size to gain power (a pursuit that only bears inevitable loneliness).  In all walks of life, you could employ great things about you, and choose a positive or negative outcome; it's the wise man who will choose the positive.
Even in retaliation, Will Hunting made the ""Michael Bolton clone"" think about the pointless tyrannical attempt that only resulted in a futile attempt at power.  The true objective was not to show how intellectual you were, but to express yourself to that girl (Minnie Driver).  He may have realized that we're all the same, and you don't use knowledge to make somebody smaller.  (I hope this gives him something to think about on his way to the ski trip.)
""Good Will Hunting"" truly reiterated the fact that two friends sitting at a park bench, one with no education, and another with various degrees and achievement, can have a conversation and enjoy any kind of that with each other, without having to show each others' resumes. Conversations about life, love, or the pursuit of intellectuality, to the simplest conversations like ""How am I gonna pay back my student loan?"" are just as enjoyable and fulfilling.
""Everybody has their favorite fruit, whether it be a mango, orange, or apple, and they have their reasons why that's their favorite fruit; and not one person will ever give a damn about the condition of the tree.""",953942400,4,4232,5.107091172214182

87833,5,0788814664,"Absolutely one of the best films I've seen.  ""Good Will
Hunting"" debunks a commonly held myth of the link of formal
education with intelligence.  In fact, so many ""brains"" have
been so ""different"", that running with the herd in a regular
job can be difficult.  Will is a mathematical genius who does not need
to pursue it publicly.  However, others see this as a golden
opportunity for society and Will.
Given the often believed
psychological premise that people want what they cannot have, Will
does not find challenging that which is most people who have worked
very hard to accomplish some of the extremely advanced mathematic
skills that come all to natural to Will, deeply feel he must pursue
this, because they know what potential he has - and they would die to
have that ability. Will, on the other hand, really could care less!
He exhibits his passionate loyalty to his blue collar roots, and no
degree of academic prestige is going to diminish this deeply ingrained
part of Will.
This brings us back to identity studies, and
following a vocation and/or lifestyle based on inner self, as
Neo-Freudian, Erik Erikson, and further identity researchers of the
20th century, honed in on.  Why should Will fool himself?  ""To
thine own self be true.""
Robin Williams, who ultimately
counsels Will, once again, is excellent, as he emphasizes the
""important"" things in life.  Given that, he and Will strike
a common thread - one that changed both of their lives.  He brought
out a realization in Will that no one had ""pulled out"".  And
this experience has powerfully affected the counselor as well.  Thus,
this is more internally rewarding than any fields medal, which the
professor who encouraged Will to pursue his mathematical genius, had.

Will, having read extensively, but is a also a perceptual genius,
interprets a painting in Robin's room, which elicts such incredible
upsetting emotions in Robin; however, Robin comes back to teach Will
that, yes, you can speak in books, but I can in experience - and he
then opens Will up to some of the finest pursuits in life.
Robin
""touches"" Will in a way which ultimately brings Will to
decide things he would not have.  He brought him to see a part of
himself he didn't know he had, and knowing it came from this
counselor, who has also been through so much pain, Will can himself
trust and validate his words.

Video quality: I thought it was excellent but what I liked most about this dvd was the anamorphic view. This means a wider than usual  widescreen which means a bigger picture for most of us.

Features: I made the mistake in buying the regular  version of this dvd. Features-wise it only has a music video as an added  extra. A little poor on the features but thats why they have the collectors  edition.
Movie: The movie itself is a great movie. Set in Boston, the  movie caught me by suprise because I usually like action movies and not  drama.

""Good Will Hunting"" is driven by its both warm and cold moments...the character interaction is not  what you would expect--maybe that's why it's so fresh. On that last lengthy  review, you probably noticed how nitpicky the reviewer was about  unimportant details in the movie. And since the movie didn't show EVERY  date Will went on with his girlfriend, I can only assume it was more than  two, hence they fell in love. All this said, I would recommend this film if  you're an AVERAGE movie viewer who can willingly suspend disbelief for  awhile. Also it helps if you love movies with great acting (Williams  especially shines), humor, drama, and the ability to prove that young,  aspiring screenwriters have something to offer to the film industry.",945043200,,859,4.86896551724138

It IS a  feel good movie, but along the way you get treated to great acting from  Robin Williams, good acting from Matt Damon, Minnie Driver and Ben Afflect,  and a genuinely funny script. If there is a weakness in the plot it is that  boy genius/floor scrubber is a little hard to swallow.  But this is ,after  all, the movies and I contend that a little artistic liscence should be  granted in such matters.

87843,1,0788814664,"I've recently struck up a mini-conversation with friends about the crummy director Gus Van Sant.  Well, tonight I did something I almost never do: I walked out of a movie that was still playing. I sat through 75 minutes of  _Good Will Hunting_, my suffering steadily increasing, till I found I could  take no more, and left.  I already had a VERY bad premonition when the  opening credits included the following: WRITTEN BY MATT DAMON AND BEN  AFFLECK As I read this, I swore under my breath.  What can you expect of a  movie written by two so-called handsome young actors, and directed by the  inept Van Sant?  A disaster.  And disaster we got. I don't think _Good Will  Hunting_ manages to depict truthfully, or entertainingly, ANYthing that it  has made its subject.  Nevertheless, I'd like to remark that *IF* the  atmosphere at M. I. T. and Harvard is in any way similar to what we got to  see in this movie, I pray I'll never get to visit those and similar places,  and will never have to deal with people educated in those and similar  establishments.  8-) The biggest shortcoming of _Good Will Hunting_ is its  total LACK OF BEAUTY.  But there's no art without beauty. Last night I saw  another recent American movie that has been enjoying the reputation of a  masterpiece here in Europe: Tony Kaye's _American History X_.  It IS a  masterpiece -- gripping, affecting from the first minute to the last.  (The  cast, including Hollywood legends in supporting roles, is uniformly superb,  but Edward Norton tops them all.)  Kaye's is a BRUTAL, VIOLENT, OBSCENE  movie -- but, at the same time, it manages to be BEAUTIFUL, not only in  certain moments but consistently. By contrast, in the supposedly feel-good  movie _Good Will Hunting_ what we get in place of beauty are daft cliches  spoken by an absurdly solemn-faced Robin Williams; these shots alternate  with close-ups of Matt Damon's mug, who pretends to be affected to tears by  what Williams has to say -- after all, Damon CO-WROTE Williams' lines (and  this shows unfavorably throughout).  Just as the authors of the movie  wanted to make us believe that Will Hunting was a genius, it must have been  immediately obvious to the viewers that the SCREENWRITERS of this movie  were the opposites of geniuses: blundering dilettantes of the worst sort.  I'm no Robin Williams fan, but I thought he was considered to be one of the  greatest American actors of his generation.  Why does he DEBASE HIMSELF  like this?  Is he *that* short of money?  How could he ever say yes to a  trite screenplay written by a pair of obviously immature, dabbling,  amateurish screenwriters and fellow actors who could have been his sons?  I've no idea who Matt Damon is and I don't care.  But it was pitiful to see  Ben Affleck in this disaster and, above all, to learn that he co-wrote it.  Don't know about you guys, but has any of you ever seen a MERCUTIO that was  as PERFECT, thrilling to watch, as Ben Affleck was in _Shakespeare in  Love_?

87853,2,0788814664,"This is a carefully constructed film which has received extensive critical acclaim. The story line is centred on Goodwill, played by Matt Daemon, a delinquent youth who is frequently in  trouble with the authorities. As a  child, everything which was bad happened to Goodwill,  abused by his  father, abandoned by his mother, brutalised and nowhere encouraged, he took  to  reading books to escape this hell. We join Goodwill as a young man and  a member of loyal,  courageous and jokey all-white, manual working class  peer group whom we are invited to become familiar with.
By chance  Goodwill has a photographic memory which combined with inate genius enables  him to solve phenomenally difficult mathematical problems. Working as a  janitor in a prestigious University , Goodwill is talent spotted by an  ambitious mathematics professor and soars to preeminence with the  assistance of a therapist played by Robin Williams.
So far, so  good...well not quite, there is something which does not ring true; the  film is set in Boston which has a high Black population and yet blacks are  invisible throughout. Indeed, the film's artificial social landscape is  consistently white and male, the only way in which women are inserted is  through the cipher of a confident middle-to-upper class English medical  student who is impressed by Goodwill`s display of rugged combativity  combined with a razor sharp  intellect.
Goodwill's knock-about peer group  present a seductive image, with echoes from the film Good Fellahs, since  they appear to be devoid of anything unpleasant such as homophobia or  sexism and most especially the racism which is so virulent in U.S. society.  Maybe this group have reached a more advanced political level than the  majority part of white US society or perhaps they have learnt to disguise  their attitudes behind politeness in the same way as the ""professional  classes"". A more probable explanation is that this film is yet another  manifestation of the great New Right lie, namely that there is nothing  fundamentally wrong with society other than a dependency creating nanny  state and man-hating, pinko-liberal, affirmative action junkies. This  ideological offensive is given ""theoretical"" underpinning by the  rehabilitation of genetic explanations for criminality, deviant behaviour  and, of course, genius, which brings us back to the film...
The dialogue  is peppered with willfully misleading statements, eg. we are  authoritatively  informed that ""Einstein was a mere patents clerk"" and that  ""Beethoven and Mozart simply sat down and played the piano"". In other words  these skills were already imprinted on their genes.  The truth is quite  different; Einstein grew up in an emotionally affirmative family where  parents  and relatives encouraged puzzle solving and intellectual  exploration, he went on to become a  patents analyst which, of course,  requires substantial scientific insight. Beethoven and Mozart were brought  up in families of professional musicians.
Moreover, even if we accept  that some people have a photographic memory, which is moot, then this does  not mean they will have exceptional analytical powers. It is one thing to  regurgitate and another to understand and innovate. To have both plus an  upbringing which would make Oliver Twist an object of envy can only mean  one thing of course, it's all in Goodwill's genes!
Indeed, the film is  an attack on the social model of humanity, to quote the venerated Richard  Feynmann ""If you can't explain something you don't understand  it"", or put another way, the  process of collective human engagment  develops a more rounded understanding of a particular  problem. For a  conceptual breakthrough to take place there needs to be both individual and  collective deliberation with a flux and reflux of thinking between the  two. The former without  the latter tends to lead to a narrow intellectual  focus, the latter without the former produces  unlimited horizons with no  content eg. New Labour Blair speak.
The therapist relentlessly breaks  down Goodwill's emotional armoured plating as he matches  Goodwill trauma  for trauma as well as outwitting, out-silencing and outlifting him on the  bench  press. But this therapist is special in the American way; he had his  coming of age experience of through the Vietnam War . As the relationship  between the pair grows and reaches it's inevitable climax the only thing  missing in this modern day reaffirmation of traditional maleness  is the  camp fires and drum-playing.

An interesting premise and some talented actors get lost in the morbid facination with cursing and shallowness of character.  The accolades given  this film are simply misplaced.  Don't waste your time.  Get a real film  like Brother Sun, Sister Moon to be inspired.",918691200,4,330,5.018518518518518
87855,1,0788814664,"I swear I must've heard the word F-U-*-*. (You know what comes next) 20 times in ten minutes!  Not only does this movie degrade itself with excessive strong language, but sorrily degrades mathematicians too! Those  people work their whole lives at becoming what they are, then a  non-educated little janitor comes and put them to shame!!! Yea, right!?  How on earth could Damon and Afleck have possibly won an Academy award for  bst Screenplay?  IT SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!  Don't even rent this to satisfy your  curiosity.  STAY AWAY FROM GOOD WILL HUNTING!! Or you won't be so GOOD!",917913600,4,576,4.916666666666667
87856,4,0788814664,"This film deserves all of it's accolades. The acting talent in this one film is astounding. Performances by Williams, and Damon are sensational. There are many extra featues available on this DVD, but to be honest, they  aren't worth watching. You can only watch the trailer a few timnes before  becoming tired of it. The ' making of ' feature was pretty shallow, with no  real insite into the movie. Otherwise, you must buy this DVD!!",917913600,,435,4.697368421052632

87858,5,0788814664,"What is truly amazing about this film is that it was Matt Damon's and Ben Affleck's first attempt at doing a film of their own.  Everything about this movie was great - the storyline, the acting, the way it pulls you in.  From the quick-witted comebacks to the psychological duel between Damon and  Robin Williams, this film exhibits many aspects of movie-making genius.  I  would recommend this movie to anyone... with out a doubt, my favorite!",916012800,,445,4.802631578947368
87859,5,0788814664,"Good Will Hunting is one of the most moving and intellectual movies I've seen in a while, while still having plenty of comedy and some romance.  It definately deserved more awards than it received.  It is also enspiring to  know that Matt Damon and Ben Afleck wrote this movie when they were my age.  Amazing.",915494400,,309,4.5636363636363635
