8721797,2,B010CG2CWA,"I never thought I'd ever write an Oasis review less than 4* (usually 5!)  It's clear to see why this isn't ""sanctioned"" by the Gallagher brothers.  First, it's not a 3-CD Set; it's 2.  The ""Morning Glory"" An Album in Review, I had thought it would be similar to the ""Definitely, Maybe"" DVD (which is a 2-DVD set with an interactive menu that's easy to navigate, that you can toggle back & forth among live performances, interviews and music videos).  This is nothing like that!  It consists of interviews with extremely short concert footage clips (maybe 20 seconds each, here & there) from the DVD ""There and Then"", which, if you don't already own it, your money is better spent on that!  The other DVD, Brothers in Arms does Not contain interviews from 1994 to current day.  They're all from the time Oasis split.  I have read in British tabloids online that the brothers have relented to put together a Documentary.  THAT should be worth spending money on; wait for that.. not this.  I wouldn't even recommend this to staunch Oasis fans.",1455235200,,1040,4.664835164835165
