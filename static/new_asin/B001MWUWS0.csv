3702499,5,B001MWUWS0,"I used to watch this show on the Discovery Channel all the time.  I personally think it's the best forensic science/detective show ever on TV, even better than Forensic Files on Court TV (narrated by Peter Thomas).  The New Detectives is narrated by the late Gene Galusha.  His low key voice is perfect for the show.  This show focuses on the techniques that are used by detectives and forensic scientists to solve murder cases.  Crimes are reenacted.  File footage is used occasionally.  Interviews are conducted with detectives and forensic scientists.  The acting is pretty good.  The background music is pretty subtle and rather eerie.

If you're into solving mysteries and chasing down clues, then this show will give you your fix.  Overall, a great show that I highly recommend.  Not all nine seasons have been released on DVD yet, but any season will satisfy you.",1298764800,11,870,4.924137931034482
3702500,5,B001MWUWS0,"The New Dectectives is a tool that teaches a person about the ways that inspire law enforcement. Whether that means something new, like DNZ (touch DNA as well as the older styles of DNA testing), blood spatter, insects and their impacts, things on fire and other forces that can be manmade or ""acts of god, or old cases that teach lessons to be applied, this utilizes them. It reminds me of being in Science Class and learning lessons from the labs there, only these labs are not about the ways that butterflies morph. These are about people and the things that horrifically apply to some human conditions, and the things that apprehend them.

Instead of feeling forced or made for a quick buck, these lessons have a quality to them. I personally like the way it is filmed and the way the episodes flow, giving it a quality that you normally wouldn't find. Even if you see it on TV you don't SEE it either, because TV bleeps out the horrific stuff. Here you have case files come on, and some of those are really gruesome illustrations that teach you what they want you to see. It doesn't pull punches - it truly tells a story of life and death.

I boughtt his and I thought it would be good. I learned it was better, much better, and said a lot. It shows the way that people falla nd the way that technology can catch people and find a way to bring them in, even if the file seems really out-of-ddate. Its worth having, worth seeing, and worth revisiting.
5/5

Thank you.",1296864000,7,1471,4.400735294117647

3702502,5,B001MWUWS0,"My favourite true crime and forensic tv shows are 'The Real CSI: The New Detectives', 'The FBI Files', and 'Arrest & Trial'.

The Real CSI is a hell of a lot less dramatized than 'The FBI Files', but ironically, the lack of dramatic acting, the narrator, the background music, and atmosphere actually make it a more hitting, stunning, and real. Most of the shows involve local police and sheriff's office, and very rarely the FBI. This seems to make the crimes feel more real and understandable in laymens terms.

I am now of the opinion that this is actually a superior program to all it's competitors. My idea of fun is to watch this late at night, lights dimmed or off, on a huge Philips LCD tv (42-52 inch), with a logitech z-5500 surround sound system, and scare the living crap out of myself. Forget horror movies, there is nothing more scary than real life, real stories, and the psychology between human beings hurting each other.

3702503,5,B001MWUWS0,"This DVD set is well worth the money. I had seen some of the episodes on TV, but many I had not seen were on here. The episodes cover an array of events, from young to old, and how the crimes were solved. Don't miss out on this set!",1244678400,7,232,3.7551020408163267
3702504,5,B001MWUWS0,"This is a great series.  The current trend in Discovery/History Channel shows is ridiculous: some bombastic narrator is walking briskly down the street, blabbering away, as jump-cuts and overblown sound effects drown out the content.  Or the other kind: shaky-camera, Blair-Witch-Project style, as usually idiotic people try to sound incredibly excited or scared of the material they are trying to tell viewers about, trying to jack up the mood and tension level, obscuring the source material, whether that source material is actually interesting or not.  In both of these approaches, crazed sound effects, an altogether inappropriate level of false excitement and frequent commercial interruptions touting other, similar, series are all key ingredients.

The New Detectives is the opposite: a mellow narrator, moody yet very light musical score, and a focused, methodical development of the subject matter.  Episodes go in depth, showing forensic methods used to solve actual crimes, many of which are well known cases.  There is lots of science, and plenty of interviews with serious professionals.  That being said, there is a mood and tone set here- and it is a creepy one, as this series deals mostly with terrible crimes.  The music, narration, and some reenactments add to the atmosphere of quiet dread.

The steady pace and lack of grating sound effects and other nonsense fits the grim and frequently gruesome subject matter.  This series is not for the squeamish or easily frightened, as it goes into pretty serious details of murders, serial killings, abductions, rapes, etc.

I love this series- the serious treatment of the subject, the mellow, yet still moody style, and the very in-depth documentation of real cases in which forensic science was employed to solve crimes, plus the great price point, make this an excellent DVD set.",1240790400,35,1847,5.26962457337884

8322296,2,B001MWUWS0,"While the show is interesting and not over dramatized, so far the majority of episodes I've watched (season 1) have had a person of color be the culprit or in on the crime in some way. There are obviously way more cases out there that don't have to perpetuate at every turn the racist stereotypes already alive and well in our society. I'm not advocating for sensoring all of those cases out, but when it gets to the point that an episode starts and a person of color is a side character and I already know they will become the perpetrator based on the previous episodes, that is not okay. Whether this was deliberate or due to implicit bias, I cant stand to watch any more episodes.",1478563200,,683,4.3858267716535435
8322297,5,B001MWUWS0,"In these crime documentaries, I love to see the perps get caught.  Of course, what's fascinating is how the perps get caught.  Especially since this is an older show, it gives you some history of forensic science.

I do have one issue with the Prime version of The New Detectives:  During season 4 and continuing into season 5 (that's what I'm watching now), the narrator's volume is so low I can hardly hear him.  If I turn the sound up, the volume on interviews, etc., is up way to high.  I'm watching it with the sound down very low and with the subtitles turned on.  When the show runs on TV, I don't have this problem.",1472169600,2,623,4.318965517241379
8322298,5,B001MWUWS0,"The program ""Trail of the Century"" examines the double homicide trial of O.J. Simpson. There were no eye witnesses to the murders of Nicole Brown-Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in the Brentwood suburb of Los Angeles in the early morning of June 13, 1994. Evidence found at Nicole's condominium was a pullover ski cap containing hairs consistent with an African-American, a blood-soaked glove (the matching pair found at O.J. Simpson's Rockingham Drive estate), and blood impressions left from expensive size 12 Bruno Magli shoes (this wasn't presented as evidence until the civil case). A cut finger on O.J. Simpson's hand provided a plausible explanation for his blood (DNA) left at the crime scene. The odds that the blood came from someone other than O.J. was calculated at one in 170 million. Unfortunately, it was suggested that police detective Mark Fuhrman was a racists and had a motive for planting evidence to frame O.J.",1471305600,,937,5.090909090909091
