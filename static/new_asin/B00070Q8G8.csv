I would have called it the history of, but nonetheless, it was wonderful. Some said it was boring, but if you take out the bells and whistles of the common infomercial, it is a solid block of so much information. I will be able to use a substantial amount of this for my paper. I HIGHly recommend this to anyone!",1354665600,2,467,4.379310344827586

8044491,1,B00070Q8G8,"This is by far the most boring, unprofessional piece of garbage on the subject that I've ever had the misfortune to be suckered into buying.  There isn't 1 feature on the DVD that is worth a cuss.  The main feature is a nauseatingly boring history of cannabis' use across the planet.  It looks like it was made with the hope of getting it on PBS but the poor quality and the boredom factor likely kept it from ever seeing a second of air.  The worst and most insulting inclusion by far is what is supposed to be an up-close look at the annual Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam.  It's a guy ambling around with his camcorder on- utterly insulting to ask a consumer to shell out any money for this half-baked schlock.  The most intriguing thing about this DVD is the title.  If you want good dope on dope, see ""Grass"" with Woody Harrelson or buy the book ""The Emperor Wears No Clothes"" by Jack Herer.  Avoid this one like the plague.",1200182400,31,923,4.356725146198831
