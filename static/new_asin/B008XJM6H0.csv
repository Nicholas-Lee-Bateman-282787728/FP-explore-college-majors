5189502,3,B008XJM6H0,"First off, I have not bought this.

I was contemplating buying this as a gift.

Secondly, I already own the Complete Series of each of the three He-Man cartoons as released by former distributor BCI.

I have nothing against Mill Creek mind you, they're great and this set is an outstanding effort on their part.

Yet if you read the description closely, and look at the magnified ad, YOU DO NOT GET the complete series of the ""New Adventures Of He-Man"" from the 1990s. You only get the top 20 fan favorite episodes.

Otherwise, this set is awesome. You get the complete original series, the complete remake series, and some awesome exclusive bonuses.

Now, mind you the 1990s series doesn't hold up as well today not even for nostalgia, but if you're a completist then you're still going to want it.

Will I still buy this as a gift? Sure. Would I buy it for myself? Maybe.

Sincerely,
Exchronos",1353456000,12,895,4.584905660377358

5189520,1,B008XJM6H0,"TooSo, let's skip the pleasentries. You are a He-Man fan or want an ideal gift for someone in your family, so you pick the The Masters of the Universe 30th Anniversery Limited Edition DVD boxed set. Well as some of you may know from my previous reviews, I attempt to give you, the consumer, the rundown on the product that you are looking into. I will be brief, going into content and packaging as these are extremely important, especially for a limited edition set.

Content: What isn't to like? You get the original He-Man 1980's animated series, the more recent He-Man animated series and the most popular episodes of the New Adventures of He-Man. But, going through each of those episodes, had noticed one disc that would not play the last three episodes. As far as I could tell, the disc was in top condition, which means there is a severe encoding error. While I have yet to finih going through the content, I would either buy each of the series in parts or as another joint collection. But I would advise not buying this set unless it was the purpose of adding to your collection. The other contents of the package were a toy power sword and  soundtrack of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe.

Packaging: I didn't like the packaging either, to be honest. I thought that an excellent example of a better assembled DVD set was Robotech: the 20-disc collection. What I mean is that the discs are in individual sleeves and stacked ontop of one another instead of being housed in a binder of sorts. Overall, the packaging looks utterly cheap to me, the kind of set that only someone who is into collecting would desire.

Conclusion: If you are a He-Man fan, don't buy it. There are better ways to own every episode and this isn't one of them. I was utterly shocked and very disappointed when I opened this. I mean, why couldn't it have been alot like the She-Ra boxed set? That, to me, would have been more ideal. It is just too big and clunky, taking up way too much room in the process. cheaply packaged, don't buy.",1411516800,,2023,4.5040871934604905

The soundtrack was a joke, and not a funny one.  If you find this on a great sale it is worth it.

Though (as far as I can tell) it contains all of the original and 200X series, it only has the top-20 fan favourites of the New Adventures of He-Man (out of 65 total).

Contrasting the three series included here, there is a significant difference between the 200X series and the predecessors. I would let a younger audience watch the original series and the New Adventures. As an adult, however, the newly remade series is a lot more interesting. Maybe that's just what children expect these days.",1404345600,,615,4.6422018348623855

5189548,4,B008XJM6H0,"I enjoyed watching some of these old cartoons again, and season 3 was very good, season 2 is an embarrassment to the MOTU title so that's the last I'll mention it. Of the first season there are many episodes I have never seen which was a surprise to me, I have noticed this in other cartoon series, Transformers for example, I am convinced that they showed certain shows in different regions, kinda cool because I tend to remember most of what I had seen, so new stuff is, well new stuff. Season Three is an amazing adaptation to the series that explains much that had been asked about MOTU mythos and richens the universe, all with a cool booklet and the container it comes in shaped like castle Grey Skull good buy.",1395878400,,717,4.4393939393939394

5189559,5,B008XJM6H0,". This set is worth its original asking price just for the effort on the original FILMATION series being arranged in continuity order, and in one complete set. Including the Cartoon Network series as well as a top ten of the lesser-known NEW ADVENTURES of HE-MAN is pure gravy. Throw in a Soundtrack CD complete in jewel case, Documentary DVDs and an exclusive GOLD power sword accessory from MATTEL, (for your cobweb-covered original HE-MAN figure) you have an impressive value sitting in your lap.

 The only drawbacks for this set (aside from being a limited, numbered edition) is that all the DVD discs are packed tightly in the box in individual cardboard sleeves, which may be a turnoff for some; and does not contain the ENTIRETY of the NEW adventures series.",1382572800,2,766,4.8396946564885495

5189583,4,B008XJM6H0,"I grew up with the Masters of the Universe figures and the cartoons.  I love the tv series from the 80s.  I watched them in the mornings before catching the bus to school.  I collected all the figures. I did buy the previous BCI set and loved it so I had to buy this one.  Honestly, I didn't know there was a tv series in the 90s for He-Man.  I knew about some figures but never really got into them.  I have to say they aren't that bad.  Would have been nice to have all the episodes though instead of the 20 best.  I also started collecting the figures starting in 2001 but never was able to catch the new series.  I started watching those too from this set and really liked them.

Overall this set is awesome.  The sleeves for the DVDs could have been better though.  I made backups onto my computer so if they become scratched from the paper sleeves, I can just burn them again so I can watch them.",1360540800,3,902,4.120689655172414

It leaves me missing episodes which is very disappointing.

5189594,5,B008XJM6H0,"As many people have already stated, this set is nothing new to the fans of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. The previously released DVD sets produced by BCI/Eclipse are fantastic and chalk-full of extras with wonderful artwork and beautiful packaging. With that said, I still find this 30th Anniversary set to be worthy of anyone's DVD collection.

-The entire 80's Masters of the Universe television series is included; all with the same transfer quality and audio that the original sets have. I have the earlier releases, and I know that Season 2, volume 1 is extremely hard to come by - and expensive. This set is a great way to own the episodes included in season two at a much cheaper price. Also includes Six Documentary Featurettes, 100 Character Profiles, and English & Spanish Audio Tracks.

-The entire 2002 Masters of the Universe series is also included in this set. It features an awesome digital transfer and extremely clear audio throughout the whole run. Also, some of the extras included for this series include episode scripts, audio commentary from the producers, interviews with toy-line artists from Mattel and the Four Horsemen and, and a PDF comic for the unreleased final episode. This is a great way to experience the 2002 He-Man series if you happened to have missed it. It gives the cast of the original series some surprisingly cool new designs and updates many of the beloved stories found in the 80's series.

-Unfortunately this set only features 20 episodes of the New Adventures of He-Man television series that aired in the 90's. Contrary to popular belief, this new take on He-Man was quite satisfying and thoroughly enjoyable. However, the episodes that are included are some of the best in the whole run. We get to see familiar faces like King Randor, Queen Marlena, the Sorceress, and Teela along with an entire cast of new heroes and villains! Many people refer to this version of the mythos as ""He-Man in space,"" and that is a fair (although not entirely accurate) assessment. I wish the entire series was included, but I am glad that we get to see these awesome 'fan's choice' episodes, and many customers may not even know that this series existed until now. Also has an added Bonus Documentary Featurette.

Now, many people may already own everything listed above, so here are some of the extras that are included in this Anniversary set:

-A bonus ""FANS OF MOTU"" DVD containing a brand new documentary in addition to ten previously unreleased documentary programs.

As far as documentaries are concerned, this 30th Anniversary featurette has some new and not-so-new information about the Filmation series, action figures, and fan's insights and thoughts. Definitely worth watching for the true MOTU fans.

-An 11-Track CD Sountrack featuring selections from the Filmation He-Man and the Masters of the Universe series by Shuki Levy.

Although there is A LOT of missing music (I'm looking at you 2002 and New Adventures...) what we have here is rather satisfying. All of the tracks come from the 80's series and are represented in crisp, clear transfers. The music is extremely nostalgic and well worth listening to. I am very happy to have these tracks in my music collection.

-An exclusive Masters of the Universe Classics Power Sword in an Eternian Gold color scheme made just for this commemorative anniversary edition.

If you are a collector of the MOTUC figures, then this is a real treat! Made by Mattel and only available in this set, He-Man's power sword looks amazing in this new gold color. Even if you are not a collector of action figures, this would make a nice pendant or an hors d'oeuvre skewer :)

-An episode guide in the form of a 48-page commemorative booklet for all 189 episodes.

This is self-explanatory, but I should note that some of the screen captures are mistakenly re-used in the Filmation section of the booklet. Otherwise, this is an awesome little book that summarizes EVERY episode in this collection, including: 130 episodes of MotU, 39 episodes of 2002 MotU, and all 20 episodes of NA He-Man.

This collection comes in a fantastic collectors box featuring wonderful artwork by Alvin Lee and a sweet three-dimensional relief of Castle Grayskull! Each disc is individually inserted into its own sleeve and stacked on top of one another in a velvet-like encasement. The entire box is set inside a cool looking clear box that displays wonderfully should you choose to keep it inside when not in use.

All in all I am impressed with Mill Creek. I had no reason to purchase this set seeing as how I already have every episode contained herein. But the extras are what piqued my interest, and the awesome box sealed the deal. True that there is nothing really new here for the die-hard fans save for the extras, but taken on its own merit this is a wonderful set at a great price (even though I paid $90 for it back in December, grrrrr...) and if you should happen to be missing any episode from any one of these series, this is a great way to get it with extras attached! Long live He-Man and the Masters of the Universe!",1358294400,10,5103,4.803876852907639
5189595,5,B008XJM6H0,"This is a must have for any MOTU collector. The fact that you can now own the full experience combined in one box set is amazing.

I might have wanted the full NA series included as well but this is more than I could hope for so thumbs up on this one!!!!!",1358294400,,437,3.9213483146067416

It  skipped and eventually stopped on me several times while playing it on my PS3 ( which is huge, because the PS3 player is one of the best out there in terms of  playing sensitive/faulty discs).

You would think that they would have had  someone check all the discs before shipping them out, but I guess that was too much trouble on their part.

So if you buy this set, be warned,  for it isn't perfect.

I will contact Mill Creek on getting this disc replaced.",1358121600,,558,4.349514563106796
5189597,4,B008XJM6H0,"UPDATE*** January 15th 2013 ****

I receive the replacement disc and it works just fine.

The only problem (minor) that I have is that this disc is from the separate complete season 2 set that was made available in 2011. Tha artwork on the disc is not the same as the disc from the 30th anniversary collection. On the artwork of the disc it is printed 2011 contrary to the collection being written 2012, Also, the small writing on the back of the disc does not say 30th anniversary collection. All of this are minor setback because I'm happy to have all the episodes working correctly. However it does confirm, at least to me, that the disc 3 of season 2 in the 30th anniversary edition as an encoding problem and that as not been recognize or really resolve. But again they gave me a working replacement disc. So I'm happy.

END of UPDATE ***

I don't give a perfect score for htis release because it has a defective disc that is in all the sets and Mill Creek Entertainment needs to offer a replacement disc. Otherwise the set is perfect.

The problem is found on Disc 3 of season 2 (so the 11th disc out of 22).

When I buy a big dvd set, I always fastfoward all the disc to verify that they all work properly. If there is a problem (encoding or big scratch) the disc will stop playing even if it's in fastfoward mode.

Now I have 2 different blu-ray players: LG and Panasonic.

1) Here's what happens in my LG player:
- The episode ""Three on a dare"" stops playing around the middle of the episode (where the commercial should appear). I cannot get it to start again. Also, it,s not possible to play the 2 following episodes ""Just a little lie"" and ""One for all"". So I'm only capable of watching 7 of the 10 episodes on the disc.

2) Here's what happens in my Panasonic player
- The episode ""Three on a dare"" stops playing for a couple of seconds (where the commercial should appear) then resume the program. What is strange is if I fastfoward the episode from the start of it, it will not finish playing (in fastfoward) the episode. When the fastfoward it's the commercial mark, it will skip the rest of the episode and the other 2 following episodes ""Just a little lie"" and ""One for all"". The player takes me directly to the episode ""Jacob and the Widgets"". So I can work around the problem on my panasonic player but it is an encoding problem.

3) Here's what happens in my computer:
- The episode ""Three on a dare"" stops playing around the middle of the episode (where the commercial should appear). I cannot get it to start again. Also, it,s not possible to play the 2 following episodes ""Just a little lie"" and ""One for all"". So I'm only capable of watching 7 of the 10 episodes on the disc.

4) Here's what happened in the 3D player (I don't know the brand) at my futureshop store:
- The episode ""Three on a dare"" stops playing for a couple of seconds (where the commercial should appear) then resume the program. What is strange is if I fastfoward the episode from the start of it, it will not finish playing (in fastfoward) the episode. When the fastfoward it's the commercial mark, it will skip the rest of the episode and the other 2 following episodes ""Just a little lie"" and ""One for all"". The player takes me directly to the episode ""Jacob and the Widgets"". So I can work around the problem on my panasonic player but it is an encoding problem.

 I exchange my disc at my shop at Futurshop. But the new copy has the same problem. So I wrote directly to Mill Creek Enetertainment and someone named ""Lyle Goff"" will send me a replacement copy. However I do not think that they verified if the problem is in the encoding of the disc. I think it is because 2 different set with the same problem is not a coincidence. I think they should verify the disc. But I don't think the company has done that.

 If everybody would write to Mill Creek Entertainment concerning this issue, it would put pressure on them to adress the issue, correct the problem by re-pressing the disc and offering a correctedg disc as replacement. It's been done before for other sets and other companies. We just have to convince the companies and the websites like tvshowsondvd.com and digitalbits.com that the problem is real and that we need a corrected replacement disc. If I'm the only one who writes about this and complain, it's not enough. One guy is not enough. We need to be vocal. So could you please write to the Mill Creek Entertainment, tvshowsondvd.com and digitalbits.com? Then the news could be made public and everybody who buys this limited set could get a good replacement copy. Don't do it only for you but for everybody else. Thank you.",1357603200,34,4643,4.439482961222092
5189598,2,B008XJM6H0,"Well I have say this set is really good. If you have the BCI releases that came out several years ago, then don't get this. I got it thinking it was gonna contain new material on it. But No it contains the exact same extras as BCI. The only new things in this set are The 30th Celebration of He-Man. They all talked about the toys and thier Memories. But they do have a soundtrack, it's very short. It doesn't contain half of the music that was used in the 80s Cartoon. There was ALOT more music in the cartoon that wasn't on the CD. I'd say the entire CD is about 15 minutes long. So, I'd suggest if you already own the BCI sets, then don't get this, save your money. But if you missed out on the BCI releases, then GO FOR IT! It's an AWSOME SET!

5189599,5,B008XJM6H0,I was waiting for something like this. The classic cartoon with a lot of extras . and a beautiful box!,1356134400,,102,4.15
5189600,4,B008XJM6H0,"UPDATE:

As many may have noticed, DISC 3 of SEASON 2 in the collections that were sent out does not play properly. Many disatisfied customers have contacted MillCreekEntertainment and received replacement discs (the replacement disc does resemble DISC 7 of SEASON 1 but it is, in fact, the defective disc, just from its individual release). The replacement disc does play perfectly but the fact that so many collections have the same defective disc suggests a major oversight on Mill Creek's part that could have been avoided with attention to detail. Hopefully, Mill Creek understands the problem in future releases and will correct it. Anyway, on to the original review...

I bought this in honor of the 30th Anniversary of Filmation's most successful project (and because my BTC-BCI discs are starting to show signs of scratching).
Anyway, the film and sound on these discs are CRISP and CLEAR! Weighed against my BTC/BCI sets , these seem to be IMPROVEMENTS on what was already pretty impressive several years ago (believe me; this is saying something since these discs cram more material on a single disc than the original company did. Therefore, of importance to note is that the episodes are in widescreen format). True, the BTC/BCI sets contain twice as many of those entertaining Character Profiles on their discs as these do (four separate sets with 50 Profiles per rather than two to complete the original series).

Anyway, there are a few minor drawbacks even to the collection honoring the Thirtieth Anniversary of MOTU. About a minute of the ""Diamond Ray of Disappearance"" is missing from these and the original sets and is, therefore, probably gone forever (it has been rumored that the master film for the ""Diamond Ray..."" episode was damaged). It's not missing much but it creates an awkward transition in the episode (watch carefully and you'll know what I mean). Also, the ""New Adventures..."" is in ""fan favorite"" format here and the complete sets have been out of print for long enough that a working copy now would cost quite a bit of money for two sets of 32-33 episodes. This collection's treatment of the ""New Adventures..."" is, unfortunately, reflexive of how MOTU fans treated the ""New Adventures..."" back when they were first run.

Of additional note is the fact that Disc 3 of Season 2 (the 11th of 22 Discs I think) has a glaring issue in which only seven of ten episodes will play properly (the problem begins around midway through ""Three on a Dare"" for a lot of people and is pervasive through ""Just a Little Lie"" and ""One For All."") In a collection of 189 episodes, this costs us at least three but, since the problem has occurred on many peoples' discs, it is a problem with how the discs were pressed and, therefore, should be addressed. Until such a time, I have deducted one star since I originally typed this.

Anyway, in terms of the original ""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"" and the 2002 series, this collection is great for those who didn't invest in the BTC/BCI sets. For those who still have working copies of the original sets, if you wish to purchase at all (there is no REAL new material here), I would recommend purchasing this collection at a reasonable price (it is available NEW for $55.00 just twenty-four hours after its release) and once Mill Creek has had time to address the problems in these sets. While the BTC-BCI sets retain the advantage of including a more impressive library of CHARACTER PROFILES, again I say, the production value of the episodes appear to be slightly improved on this collection.",1355875200,22,3568,4.842622950819672
5189601,5,B008XJM6H0,"At last this is what we were waiting for. A massive 189 episodes plus new and exclusive extras which are a must have for the fans.
 True ""the new adventures..."" series are presented here with a top 20 best episodes but that is not a problem as that series were not regarded as high as the rest were by the fans.
 What's important is we get the first and best of the series complete as we also get the complete remake series and the 20 best episodes we get from the ""new adventures series"" are a nice addition plus we get extras like a cd soundtrack score with a booklet and new documenteries.
 ALL IN ALL IF U DON'T HAVE THE PREVIOUS RELEASES BUT EVEN IF U DO THIS IS A MUST HAVE PRODUCT TO BUY COMBINED WITH THE GREAT DVD BOX SET ARTWORK U GET.
