8251330,4,B0013JKGLA,"I am assuming anyone who is considering purchasing the spanish version of the film already knows and loves this movie. This review will focus on the disc itself.

I will say that Photographing Fairies is a sleeper. When I first saw this film, I was compelled to seek out the novel on which it is based and was surprised to find the film makers achieved a level of meaning and spiritual depth that was not to be found within the pages of Szilagy's book. The movie seems to focus in on the deeper issues of faith versus Gnosis, science versus religion, and monotheism versus a pantheism . In contrast the novel seemed like a gothic romance that only flirted with these darker more profound considerations. The film explores these issues as it beguiles, entertains and puzzles the viewer. It is a love story that focuses on existential questions for which no answer is given. It is a film I find myself returning to, each time coming away with new insights. Ben Kingsley gives a finely honed performance as the no nonsense country vicar whose wife has opened the doors of perception and has discovered the Magical World. Once she and her children open that doorway, both tragedy and wonder wait within. And something even more dangerous and beautiful awaits protagonist Charles Castle, a man unwilling to let go of the past, tragically blind to the possibility of the new love life offers him.

The disc is an improvement over the VHS, but only just by a bit. It is still full screen which is a great disappointment to this viewer. Also at the beginning the soundtrack wavers, as though this were a pan and scan of a video tape. How else could this be? This is puzzling as the picture is improved over the VHS, being markedly clearer. The sound too after the initial glitch is somewhat improved over the VHS version, presented here only in Dolby 2.0, probably its original audio format. As such the rear speakers carry little else than general ambience. It is a shame it's not in Dolby Digital 5.1 as the memorable orchestral score is quite grand. There are no extras included on this disc.

I am hoping someone will take this film and give it the widescreen treatment it so deserves. It is a beautiful film that deserves much better than this offhand presentation. I only bought it because my VHS player died. For those considering purchasing this version, I would recommend holding out for a better release.

Incidentally this is a region 2 DVD and will only play on  DVD players that are equipped to read region 2 discs.",1254528000,3,2520,4.641255605381166
8251331,5,B0013JKGLA,"I bought this DVD on Ebay a few years ago and even though I am in dire financial straits, I would never sell it.  Why isn't this movie available in US format instead of the tons of trashy films being ground out by Hollywood?  The story is strangely simple but told beautifully.  I was caught up in the tale of a man who is searching for proof of the after life in a world full of death and finds it in a most unexpected place.",1239753600,2,426,3.988235294117647
8251332,5,B0013JKGLA,"What a wonderful movie with a good cast Ben Kingsley, Emily Woof and the most underrated young actor, Toby Stephens.  I have seen many of his movies starting with the  Twelfth Night to Jane Eyre.  He can play many roles, heroes and villains and I feel he is extremely talented. Don't worry, not a stalker, in fact turned 65 this year but we seniors can still dream.  I loved how this movie followed him through the emotional torment of losing his wife the day after their wedding which put him on a quest for truth of discovering heaven or proof of an after life.  I wish this movie had been marketed here in the U.S. and wish it were available on DVD for our region.  I purchased it from Amazon but in the VHS form.  Please let me know if it ever becomes available in Region 1.",1212796800,2,778,4.2517006802721085
