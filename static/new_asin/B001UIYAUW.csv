8343876,5,B001UIYAUW,"A great deal......Thomas DVD and a wooden train. For the price of just a train, you get both that and a movie. The movie is the newer, more animated version of Thomas The Train and is much more animated and updated than the older movies. But, my son loves both the old and new versions! The train that we received was NOT the actual Thomas train in the picture, but instead ""Duck"", an older train (that might be retired now, not sure) that isn't as popular, but still one of the Thomas the Train characters. It was actually nice to not get Thomas, since we already have multiple wooden Thomas', but if you are looking to specifically buy the DVD and Thomas train together, be aware that you might not get an actual Thomas. Great buy overall!",1300147200,,741,4.416058394160584
