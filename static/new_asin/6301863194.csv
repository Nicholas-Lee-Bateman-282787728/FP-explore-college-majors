373848,4,6301863194,"Henry Hathaway's 1947 noir drama Kiss of Death is one of the first films to deal with the subject of criminal informing.  An informer, commonly referred among criminals as a squealer, stoolie, rat, or pigeon is often  trapped in an earthy purgatory.  Shunned by the underworld and suspectly  viewed by law enforcement, an informer's life becomes shrouded in self  doubt concerning the principles of right and wrong. In Kiss of Death, Nick  Bianco's ( Victor Mature) decision to turn informer against a demented,  murdering gangster named Tommy Udo (Richard Widmark) is justified by his  duty as a father to provide security for his two young daughters. When Nick  Bianco's testimony fails to convict Udo, Bianco's safe environment becomes  disrupted and threatened by the violence that was once part of his criminal  past.  Widmark making his screen debut as the cackling Udo is memorable  with shaven eyebrows,intimidating drawl, and dark gangster suits.  Mature's  performance is first rate as the ex-hood who showers his new wife (Coleen  Gray ) and children with the bliss of blue collar euphoria.  Hathaway's New  York filming locations add to the realism of Bianco's plight.  Legendary  Sing Sing prison in Ossining, ""The Tombs"" prison cells in NYC,  St. Nicholas Boxing Arena in the Bronx, and the gray streets of Greenpoint  Brooklyn provide ample imagery to the noir motif. Hathaway deftly and  subtlely escorts Udo and Bianco into a private bordello.  Most viewers are  not aware that the double entry doors manned by the tall, dark figure is a  whorehouse. ( Bianco- ""What's that smell?"" Udo-  ""Perfume""-camera fades out).  The one major flaw is Coleen Gray's  fairy tale voice over ending.  After being shot at close range, four times  with a 45. automatic, why did Hathaway allow Bianco to survive?  Hathaway  succumbed to the false noble notion that squealers will enjoy long idyllic  lives.  Not so- has anyone checked on Sammy the Bull, Joe Valachi, or Henry  Hill lately?",960422400,17,1988,5.08411214953271
373849,4,6301863194,"Kiss of Death is a crime thriller that kept me more involved then I was expecting.  Perhaps it's the fact that the Victor Mature character is pretty sympathetic.  Mature (a better actor than he was given credit for)  plays the internal conflicts of his character with a lot of conviction.  The location filming and the straightforward direction help to add a lot of  realism to the film.  The supporting cast, with the exception of Colleen  Gray, contribute good performances.  But it's Richard Widmark, in his film  debut, that leaves the strongest impression.  His giggling, psychopathic  killer Tommy Udo is one of the most memorable characters you'll ever see,  and the wheelchair scene is justifiably famous.  Kiss of Death is a  gripping crime drama.",954547200,23,756,5.040650406504065

374335,4,6301863194,"For a film whose screenplay was in part the responsibility of the legendary Ben Hecht, this movie's story line fumbles the ball horribly. Victor Mature plays small-time but veteran hood Nick Bianco, who refuses to squeal on his partners until one of them, Rizzo, betrays him in a most terrible way. To get back at Rizzo, Bianco agrees to supply leads, but those leads don't lead to the arrest of Rizzo but rather create the impression that the squealer was in fact Rizzo, who is then sought out by other criminals to punish him for his cooperation with authorities -- however, it is Rizzo's mother who is dealt the punishment instead. Nonetheless, Bianco is granted parole and builds a new life for himself, but at the cost of continued cooperation with the District Attorney's office. That leads him to gather evidence against Tommy Udo, another former associate and in fact the one who did in Rizzo's mother. The jury acquits Udo, however, after Bianco testifies in court against him, setting up a climactic confrontation between the two. All this sounds like a great plot, and it is, except that there's not a lot of real conflict until the end. Moreover, several events occur off camera, the most notable one being Udo's trial, where one could imagine fabulous interaction between Bianco and Udo, as the latter first learns who is testifying against him. Other possible threads of interest are similarly not picked up -- for instance, Bianco seems to suffer little anguish over the fact that his cooperation with the D.A. led to the death of a presumably innocent person: Rizzo's mother. The appeal of this picture, however, lies both in Victor Mature's measured but powerful portrayal of Bianco and Richard Widmark's screen debut as Udo, a role that earned him stardom and an Oscar nomination. Those performances make this film a must watch despite the failure of the story to realize its potential, and they bump up my rating of the movie from three to four stars.",1357862400,2,1970,4.8486646884272995
374336,3,6301863194,"""Kiss of Death"" is a 1947 black and white crime drama from Henry Hathaway, starring Victor Mature, Brian Donlevy, and in his film debut Richard Widmark, who co-stars as a psychopathic killer.

Victor Mature (1913-99) made his film debut in 1940 in ""One Million BC"" and unfortunately this typecast him forever as ""beefcake"", despite some good performances in this film, ""My Darling Clementine"" (1947) and ""The Robe"" (1953). Here he plays a crook trying to go straight but unable to provide for his family.

Rugged Richard Widmark plays a giggling psychopath who befriends Mature, only to have Mature cut a deal with the DA to betray him. Widmark was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe for his debut here, and also nominated for an Emmy for ""Vanished"" (1971). He appeared in more than 50 films, initially as a villain but increasing as a hero.

Brian Donley (1901-72) plays the DA who takes an interest in Mature. Donlevy was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 1939's ""Beau Geste"" as the sadistic Sergeant Markoff. He appeared in almost 100 films between 1923 and 1969, but his busiest period was the 40s when he did more than 30 films including ""Command Decision"" (1948), ""The Virginian"" (1946), ""Two Years Before the Mast"" (1946), and ""Hangmen Also Die"" (1943).

Coleen Gray (1922) plays Mature's love interest. She may be best known for her role in ""Red River"" (1947) and in film noir - ""The Killing"", ""Nightmare Alley"", and ""The Sleeping City"".

Karl Malden (1912-2009) has a small role as a detective. He's probably best known as Lt. Mike Stone from TVs ""The Streets of San Francisco"" or as the guy from the American Express ads, but Malden's career was exceptional. He won an Oscar for ""Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951) and was nominated for ""On the Waterfront"" (1954). He won one Emmy and had 4 nominations, as well as 3 Golden Globe nominations. He could play a villain - Sheriff Longworth in ""One Eyed Jacks"" (1961), Tom Fitch in ""Nevada Smith"" (1966) - as well as a hero - General Bradley in ""Patton"" (1970).

Millard Mitchell (1903-53) plays Malden's sidekick. Mitchell won the Golden Globe in 1952 for ""My Six Convicts"". He made only 37 films but was always memorable. I liked him best in ""Twelve O'clock High"" (1949) as Gregory Peck's command officer.

The film was directed by Henry Hathaway (1898-1985), a director who specialized in westerns from his earliest films - ""Heritage of the Desert"" (1932), ""Wild Horse Mesa"" (1932) - to his later films - ""Shootout"" (1971), ""5 Card Stud"" (1968), yet curiously enough his only nomination for an Oscar was for ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935), and his best known films are non-Westerns (e.g., ""Of Human Bondage"", ""Call Northside 777"", ""The Desert Fox""). He once said ""To be a good director you've got to be a bastard. I'm a bastard and I know it.""

Norbert Brodine (1896-1970) is the cameraman. He was nominated for an Oscar 3 times, and won an Emmy for ""Letter to Loretta"" (1953). He filmed more than 100 films including James Mason as ""The Desert Fox"" (1951), Howard Hawks' ""I Was a Male War Bride"" (1949), Victor Mature's ""One Million BC"" (1940), and ""Of Mice and Men"" (1939).

The film is a typical crime drama from the 40s, often mis-labeled ""film noir"". Though it is shot on location in New York and does have some seedy characters, the basic happy ending and the absence of a femme fatale keep the film well outside the film noir range.

The acting is adequate, if not inspiring, and the photography is good. Richard Widmark's giggling psychopath had quite an impact at the time, though in retrospect it seems more like a Frank Gorshin impersonation. What's really unusual about this film is that it makes a ""stoolie"" heroic. In even the most cynical crime stories, being a ""rat"" is never glamorized. But in this film being a ""Judas"" seems to be a good thing.

FWIW - In the original story, Mature's wife was raped by one of Mature's gang, but this reference was cut in the film, making it a little harder to understand his bitter feelings.

1947 wasn't the best year for films. The Oscar winners were ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""Gentlemen's Agreement"" and the box office leaders included ""Unconquered"", ""The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer"", ""Mother Wore Tights"" and ""Life with Father."" Other notable films that year were ""Dark Passage"" (Bogart), ""The Lady From Shanghai"" (Orson Welles), and ""Possessed"" (Joan Crawford).

The NY Times called it ""a pip of a melodrama"" and said ""Henry Hathaway has squeezed every last drop of suspense out of the story through his carefully paced direction."" They called it ""Victor Mature's best character"" and said ""Mr. Widmark runs away with all the acting honors.""

Bottom line - an OK crime drama from the 40s.",1318550400,5,4723,4.7862407862407865
374337,4,6301863194,"Sure I am an aficionado of film noir, especially those 1940s detective epics like the film adaptations of Dashiell Hammet's Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon and Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowe in The Big Sleep. Nothing like that gritty black and white film, ominous musical background and shadowy moments to stir the imagination. Others in the genre like Gilda, The Lady From Shang-hai, and Out Of The Past rate a nod because, in addition to those attributes mentioned above, they have classic femme fatales to add a little off-hand spice to the plot line, and, oh ya, they look nice too. Beyond those classics this period (say, roughly from the mid-1940s to mid-1950s) produced many black and white film noir set pieces, some good, some not so good. For plot line, and plot interest, the film under review, Kiss of Death, is under that latter category.

But hold on though. Although the plot line is thin, mainly about a middle level career con gone wrong once again who, to save his kids from a fatherless and motherless future (mother having committed suicide), decides to play ball with the law. Thus, chump Nick Bianco (played pretty well by Victor Mature, given what he had to work with) turned stoolie, rat, fink, turncoat and the other ten thousand names for such a wrong gee and the rest of the plot hangs on that idea. Say idea being that it is not good business (and for all I know, maybe, unethical, unethical in the criminal code of conduct, although my own very small youthful experience is that it is ""every man for himself"") to turn stoolie, especially if the price of ""freedom"" is to tangle, tango, or whatever with one Tommy Udo. No way, no how, not for anything.

And that is what saves this thing as a crime noir classic, the performance of Richard Widmark as psycho-killer for hire Tommy Udo. Everything about him from minute one says wrong gee, don't mess. Although, needless to say, Nick will mess (Tommy has threatened his kids and his new honey after all). Yes, although I was only a babe then I will give a retroactive vote to Richard Widmark for that 1947 Oscar he won for best supporting actor. There have been a lot of scary psycho-killers that have come down the pike since then but I would not, and would not advise others, to tangle with this guy. And you would too. Kudos.",1298592000,,2307,4.624390243902439

Richard Widmark would have never gotten his Academy nomination if this were the film version shown in theaters in 1947.  The scene when he pushes Riso's mother down the stairs does not end with her landing at the bottom of the stair well, but it does in this chopped up TV version.

374341,5,6301863194,"KISS OF DEATH begins with a jewelry store robbery.  The robbery takes place in a skyscraper, and the thieves must escape down the main elevators.  That escape sequence has more tension in it than most suspense films do in their entirety.

This is a wonderfully directed ""docu-noir"" film, shot on location by veteran director Henry Hathaway.  The realistic tone, narrated by one of the female characters, is enhanced both by naturalistic sets and performances.  As a result, we are more sensitive to the characters and situations.  Had the film been made in an artificial, studio-bound environment, it is quite likely that Richard Widmark's role as ""Tommy Udo"" would not have had the impact it did.

Widmark's remarkable debut performance is one of the movie's highlights.  Not only is he truly frightening when involved in some sadistic activity, but he also causes a certain nervous excitement when he isn't doing much of anything, simply because you feel he could 'fly off the handle' at any moment.

The plot involves Nick Bianco (Victor Mature in one of his best roles), a basically decent fellow who has resorted to crime, because he can't find work.  Ultimately, the Assistant D.A. (Brian Donlevy) manages to convince Bianco to operate as a police informant, in order to obtain and maintain his parole.  Unfortunately, this involves informing on Tommy Udo....

A great film from beginning to end; KISS OF DEATH also boasts a Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer screenplay, and cinematography by Norbert Brodine.  Brodine also worked with Hathaway on THE HOUSE ON 92nd STREET (1945).

374343,5,6301863194,"Nick Bianco and his gang sweat through the first few minutes of this knockout noir as they pull off a jewelry heist on a high floor in a Manhattan skyscraper. The tension is superbly handled as the trio waits out a long elevator ride down, knowing that one of the tied up or unconscious jewelers could be alerting the police at any time, and the Christmas joy and cheer around them only heightens the anger and frustration that Bianco feels at having to resort to a life of crime, though we are told (by the interesting choice of a female narrator) that he's been trying to go straight. Alas, Bianco gets caught - though the rest of his gang gets away - and goes to prison, despite a sympathetic Assistant DA trying very hard to get him to save himself - and his wife and kids - by squealing.

Justly famed as the film that made Richard Widmark a star, and there's no question that he steals every scene he's in, smirking and snickering with one of the creepiest laughs and most obviously crazed faces you've ever seen. But Widmark's only a supporting character, and the picture more rightly belongs to Victor Mature as the small-time lifelong con trying to go straight - and Mature delivers in probably the best performance of his career, aching with a weariness that only prison could bring to a man still in his prime, with sad eyes and regret etched into every movement in his lumbering frame. Widmark was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but IMO Mature deserved a nod in the lead category just as much; it's really hard to imagine anybody - even the biggest of noir stars like Kirk Douglas, Robert Ryan or Humphrey Bogart - doing better in the role.

I won't spoil the rest of the plot - this one develops very organically and naturally for the most part, and the use of real locations in New York and the acting choices and fairly low-key music make this one of the more ""real""-seeming and natural of all films noir.  Director Henry Hathaway, best known for his westerns today, puts it all together with conviction and tautness, never a wasted moment.  An utter masterpiece.",1253491200,7,2084,4.564171122994653

In the story, he turns ""stoolie"" so he can earn that freedom and be that family man.

Among film noir buffs, however, this film is noted more for Richard Widmark's debut as the sadistic ""Tommy Udo."" One of the most famous noir scenes of all time is ""Udo"" throwing an old lady in a wheelchair down a flight of stairs! Widmark puts on a fake pair of choppers giving him an exaggerated overbite to go along with his insane little giggle. He also calls everyone a ""squirt."" His over- the-top performance puts a lot a spark into this film which, otherwise would have wound up more as a melodrama.

This is a classic old movie of great quality and I believe it was Mr. Widmarks debut and he played an awesome bad guy with the most wicked giggle you have ever heard.

The shock and anger over his wife's death and his childrens' plight change Bianco's mind about cooperating with the DA's office.  He gives them information about several cases that win him a parole.

This 1947 film noir is famous among film fans for the fantastic debut performance of Richard Widmark as the psychopathic killer Tommy Udo.  The unforgettable scene of his pushing a woman in a wheelchair down the stairs while braying his famous and inimitable snarling laugh has been shown countless times for its shock value.  It still shocks today, even in our violence-desensitized society.

Udo's nasal-toned ""big man"" contempt toward a better class of people, and Bianco in particular at the end of the movie, is another classic acting invention that Widmark created for his Oscar-nominated role.  After Bianco testifies against Udo, and Udo walks anyway, it is only a matter of time for the violent denouement that ends the picture.

I found Victor Mature's performance surprisingly solid and low-key.  It is a far cry from his later stereotype as the outsize overactor required in ""Samson and Delilah,"" ""Demetrius and the Gladiators,"" and ""Hannibal,"" which are wonderful viewing for the 8-12 year crowd. He is right for the Bianco part. His acting is controlled and subtle. He is convincing as a film noir hero; a basically good guy who cannot catch a break.  His redemption comes, of course, through righting a wrong.

Brian Donlevy does his usual solid acting job as the Assistant D.A.  Coleen Gray is sweetness and light as the babysitter who becomes his second wife and a key player in Bianco's rehabilitation.  She does a nice job of narration as well.  Karl Malden has a bit part as one of the detectives in one of his early performances.

Widmark's performance is classic, but the movie itself is well worth seeing for its suspense and fast-paced plot.  Ben Hecht was one of the screenplay writers.

Yes, I'm aware the term was one applied by the French to describe some American movies after WWII, but believe me, the average viewer didn't call them 'noir' back then. They were just movies, and we expected to see them whenever we went to see a 'detective' show. Generally, if you did not see a western at the local bijou, you saw a movie similar to this one. They rather proliferated back then, now they have come to define an age.

I know I have seen this one before, but recently on the movie channels I have had the chance to see both A KISS BEFORE DYING and now KISS OF DEATH and just want to say how good it is to see them again. The actors, the scriptwriters, and the producer/directors are no longer with us to ever make these type movies again.

374524,4,6301863194,"Shot on location in New York, which few films could claim back in 1947, Henry Hathaway's Kiss of Death is a sensationally thrilling film noir that features one of the most memorable movie villains. A typical hard-boiled gangster film, Kiss of Death sports the essential elements of classic noir, including a confused anti-hero, devious villains, gunplay and action, incompetent cops and sets that cast shadows on everything that steps past the screen.

Nick Bianco (Victor Mature) is a common mob criminal with a stirring sense of decency, hidden beneath his stone-like demeanor. Caught during a jewelry store heist, he refuses to rat out his accomplices and is sentenced to a harsh term in Ossining (that's Sing Sing for you gangsters). His silence comes from faith in his lawyer Howser, who regularly defends mobsters and assures him that he will get an early release and soon be reunited with his wife and kids. But as time passes and he hears nothing from his lawyer, he gets word from a fellow inmate that his wife has committed suicide and his kids were sent to an orphanage.

Distraught at his loss and his inability to help his children, he decides to aid the district attorney with nailing the other criminals involved in his organization, in return for a lightened sentence. When he is able to provide sufficient evidence against mob hitman Tommy Udo (Richard Widmark), a trial is set, but the jury finds Udo innocent. Realizing the dangers of a stoolie, Bianco sends his newfound girlfriend Nettie (Coleen Gray) away with his kids for safe keeping so that he can settle the score against the vengeful Udo.

Bianco is a classic noir anti-hero who is not an entirely bad guy but is caught in harsh times - he wants to go straight but is doomed to never be able to fully remove himself from the criminal lifestyle. Although he eventually breaks free from his sense of duty to the mob, the ilk that surrounds him returns to pull him back in. Seeing an anti-hero continually make mistakes despite his overall decency is nothing entirely new, but Bianco's gentle-giant temperament assists in defining a character that we can't help but admire and pity. In addition, the police incompetence forces the character to take on odds and stress that would shatter a man with less gumption.

However, nothing can outdo Richard Widmark's show-stealing performance as the unhinged Tommy Udo, a villain so sinister not even a mother could love. Slapping dames, antagonizing the innocent, cackling like a madman at every word and throwing wheelchair-bound old ladies down flights of stairs is just the beginning of Udo's vicious character development, which leaves the audience grinning with glee at how innovative this gangster from the 40's was. His unique design was a stepping stone for future criminals who all outperform the protagonists we're supposed to be rooting for. ""He's nuts and he's smarter than you are,"" quips Bianco to district attorney Louis D'Angelo (Brian Donlevy) after Udo weasels past the jury with charges of murder.

A luxurious noir score also presides over the events of the luckless Bianco, with thanks to composer David Buttolph who carefully submerges us in the moody atmosphere of this hard-boiled thriller. Nominated for two Academy Awards, one for Widmark's outstanding supporting performance, and one for the original screenplay (with Nettie's sultry voice to narrate), Kiss of Death is indispensable film noir.

374530,4,6301863194,"""Kiss of Death"" was directed by Henry Hathaway based on an unpublished story by Eleazar Lipsky, who had been a district attorney in New York city. Hathaway also made ""Call Northside 777"" and ""The House on 92nd Street"", both docudramas inspired by true stories, and he tried to accentuate the authenticity of this material as well. The film was shot on location in New York. Those really are the Criminal Courts and Chrysler buildings and The Tombs and Sing Sing prisons. In fact, Hathaway had the cast ""processed"" through Sing Sing to add a dose of realism to their performances. One could debate which of Hathaway's films, ""Kiss of Death"" or ""The Dark Corner"", is the more ""noir"". They both qualify but deviate considerably from noir themes at times. ""The Dark Corner""'s Bradford Galt is a quintessential noir protagonist, while ""Kiss of Death"" is best remembered for its villain, the sadistic Tommy Udo, who launched Richard Widmark into a series of unforgettable low-life roles.

Unemployed and unemployable due to his prison record, with a family to support, Nick Bianco (Victor Mature) returns to a life of crime. Briefly. He's caught robbing a jewelry store. Assistant D. A. D'Angelo (Brian Donlevy) offers Nick a reduced sentence if he squeals on his cohorts. Nick refuses, confident that his family will be cared for by his partner and his sleazy lawyer (Taylor Holmes) while he's in Sing Sing. Three years later, Nick learns that his wife has died and his daughters have been placed in an orphanage. When he receives a visit from Nettie (Coleen Gray), a young woman who used to babysit his girls and who harbors feelings for him, Nick realizes that his friends reneged on their promise to support his family. So Nick decides to take D'Angelo up on his offer. D'Angelo wants to get the goods on Tommy Udo (Richard Widmark), a bloodthirsty, sociopathic mob killer. But if all doesn't go precisely as planned, Nick will have the most ruthless, sadistic assassin in New York hunting him.

""Kiss of Death"" begins with an evocative title sequence in which a woman's hand reaches for a revolver, tantalizing the viewer with the implication of sex and violence to come. Curiously, the sequence has little to do with the movie. There are guns in ""Kiss of Death"", but none in a woman's hand. Yet the hand that clenches that gun is clearly that of a woman, with long, shaped nails. Maybe this is evidence of how strong and alluring the image of femme fatales had become in crime films as of 1947. A voice-over narration introduces us to Nick Bianco, also unusual because it is the voice of a woman. It's Nettie, telling us how Nick was forced into a life of crime by circumstances. Her voiceover will recur at several points during the film, always sowing sympathy for Nick. ""Kiss of Death""'s attempts to make Nick out to be a victim of poverty or social injustice have been interpreted by some critics as an element of social conscious -however muddled- in this hardened crime film. Honestly, I think it is a device to create sympathy for the protagonist and nothing more.

Nick Bianco is a good guy -if a little crooked- in a corrupt world, where doing the right thing is as risky and nearly as sleazy as being a hood. Nick remarks to D.A. D'Angelo, ""Your side of the fence is almost as dirty as mine."" Victor Mature could dazzle in everything from sleazebucket to persecuted nice guy roles. But the greatest star of ""Kiss of Death"" might be Norbert Brodine's camera. The film's best scene has the camera in an elevator, as Nick tries to make his escape while the elevator makes its way from the 23rd floor to the lobby. The anxiety is palpable. The silence is oppressive. It's brilliant. Our introduction to the villainous Tommy Udo is also daring. The first time we seen Udo, he is out of focus and taking about sticking his thumbs in someone's eyes. There's nothing vague about Tommy Udo, yet there he is: blurry. Richard Widmark gives a gleefully sadistic, rhythmic performance that earned him an Academy Award nomination. Udo is, indeed, a fine example of  Widmark's considerable talent, though not an example of his depth, as Udo is two-dimensional.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005): There is a theatrical trailer narrated by Walter Winchell (2 min), a Stills Gallery of 9 movie posters, and an audio commentary by film noir scholars Alain Silver and James Ursini. The commentary is consistently good. Silver and Ursini discuss ""docu-noir"" films, the visual and auditory implications of location shooting, themes, imagery, actors, analyze the ideas behind each scene, and relate some anecdotes about the notoriously tyrannical Henry Hathaway.

Udo is the psychopath played by Richard Widmark in Kiss of Death, and though he is (like Lecter) only on screen briefly, he dominates this movie.  Udo is a nasty character, even more so when you consider this movie was made in the 1940s when the Production Code softened most of the edges in Hollywood.  Though we only see him commit two real acts of violence in the movie, both are done with such gleeful brutality it is well understood why other characters fear him.

And none dread Udo more than Victor Mature's Nick Bianco, the main character in this movie.  Nick is a petty crook whose bad luck at the movie's beginning lands him in prison once again.  Given the opportunity to reduce his sentence by ratting out others, he chooses silence, impressing his jailmate, Udo.  Eventually, circumstances force Nick to barter for his freedom, and part of the cost is eventually testifying against Udo, an act that will bring peril to both Nick and his family.

This is classic film noir, with an antihero lead, plenty of crime and dark, seedy settings (all that's missing is a femme fatale).  In today's suspense films, we often get a happy ending, but there are no such guarantees in noir; we don't know Bianco's ultimate fate, and far be it from me to reveal it here.  If it's a little tame by today's standards, it still is a good, solid movie, maybe not perfect (Mature is a bit stiff as an actor, which just makes Widmark shine more), but clearly four-star material.  While some of the Fox Noir releases are borderline noir at best, this one is a worthwhile addition to the collection for fans of this genre.",1137024000,8,2006,4.569832402234637
374590,4,6301863194,"The special atmosphere of film noir often rests on darkness, imperfection, and crime, but also applies occasions with ambiguous situations where morality is not simply black and white.  In the beginning a narrating voice reveals that Nick Bianco (Victor Mature), a criminal, has continuously tried to exit the criminal career.  However, his past continues to haunt him, as negative biases towards criminals often affects peoples feelings, and it has kept him unemployed for a year.  The robbery was his only way back to financial redemption while providing the necessary means for his family and two daughters, but his escape is not successful as the police catch him.

Extremely striking is the escape scene in the beginning of Kiss of Death (1947) after Nick and his partners attempt to flee the crime scene.  Calmly they enter an elevator on the 24th floor where they robbed an upscale jewelry store.  However, the calm is a pretend cool, as the visuals of the scene suggest apprehension and panic in their faces while the elevator slowly descends.  The elevator induces a profound claustrophobic atmosphere with the large crowd entering and exiting the tight space.  In addition, the repeated stops on almost every floor on the downward journey augments the suspense, as the audience anticipates the long arm of the law to enter the elevator at any time.  The descent also possesses strong symbolic value in regards to film noir, as it sends a signal of looming tragedy.

The combination of the escape scene and the opening narration leaves the viewer sympathetic towards criminal Nick, even as he refuses to cooperate with the police in order to have his sentence reduced. His refusal to cooperate with the police rests within the criminal code by which he lives, as nobody snitches on anyone.  Warmly he welcomes the prison sentence, as he has been told that people will take care of his family. However, in jail he finds out that something wrong has happen to his family, and promises has not been kept.  This leaves Nick with no other option than to break the code of silence by approaching the Assistant District Attorney DeAngelo (Brian Donlevy) and offering him information on his old buddies.

A collision between Nick's old lifestyle and the new changed way is not an easy transition.  It is difficult on many different levels, but the circumstances do not offer him any luxury with multiple choices.  He also realizes that an old acquaintance Tommy Udo (Richard Widmark) has climbed high in the criminal hierarchy though his ruthlessness that displays neither guilt nor compassion.  Richard Widmark's brilliant performance seems to be a crossing between the Joker and Hannibal Lecter, and it helps to enhance the suspense in the film.  Through his connections Nick reunites with Tommy with the intention of entrapping him on the behalf of the law.  However, Nick is also conscious about the possible dangers that Tommy might pose, if the law does not succeed in convicting him.

Nick's situation portrays a sad story of social biases and the society's unforgiving approach to criminality without regard to the circumstances.  The film also presents a sense of meaninglessness in regards to criminal law when it cannot provide safety to the innocent.  In addition, the film allows the audience to reflect on how truly blind the law is in regards to who requires safety and who gets it, as it touches on the shadow of the American legal system.

Kiss of Death provides a thoughtful cinematic experience in the true spirit of film noir.  Richard Widmark's performance improves the quality of the film, as he brings out a truly sinister character that has no intention of doing good.  The contrast between Tommy and Nick, the changed man that Victor Mature plays, offers an honest and dark perspective on the imbalance of social injustice and the legal system's blindness.",1135209600,5,3882,5.001555209953343
374591,4,6301863194,"Richard Widmark's turn as the charming psychopath Tommy Udo ranks high in film annals.  The few instances that he is onscreen the wattage of the film multiplies tenfold.  Herein lies the problem.  Through no fault of his own, Widmark's performance runs counter to the tone of the film established by director Henry Hathaway and seems to belong in another picture.  Hathaway's film is a stark documentary style account of a con (Victor Mature) attempting to go straight by turning state's evidence on his former associates.  Mature is fine as is Brian Donlevy as a sympathetic D.A. and Coleen Gray as Mature's wife.  The performers other than Widmark play their character's realistically and seem to be compatible with Hathaway's style.  As much as I enjoyed Widmark, by contrast he seemed to be playing an exaggerated bad guy straight out of ""Batman"".  ""Kiss of Death"" is a fine film that just misses the mark in being considered a great film.",1134432000,2,943,4.924050632911392
374592,2,6301863194,"Does anyone at Fox bother to look at their DVDs before they are released to the public?

Just like with Fox's mediocre release of Mark of Zorro, starring Tyrone Power, in Kiss of Death there are compression artifacts -- check the bars on the holding cell when Brian Donlevy is talking to Victor Mature. Yet this is a dual-layer disc!

As well, the print is >bad<. Notice the walls when Richard Widmark climbs to the top of the stairs prior to the film's most famous scene, as well as the walls in the room before he ties up the old lady and pushes her down the stairs -- there are what look like water blotches on the print. Terrible!

The obnoxious ad for video piracy at the DVD's beginning accompanied by loud, ugly rock music also doesn't make a good impression.",1134172800,8,766,4.418439716312057
374593,5,6301863194,"I won't go into giving a synopsis of this movie, others have already done so quite well.  I'm a film noir buff and ""Kiss of Death"" is certainly among the film noir classics.  This film made Richard Widmark a star and is, without a doubt, the best role Victor Mature ever played in his career.  Brian Donlevy, is probably more well known for playing characters on the wrong side of the law, but does a fine job as the DA in this movie.  This is film noir at it's best.  Other highly recommended film noir classics:  ""Double Indemnity"", ""Laura"", ""Murder, My Sweet"", ""The Killers"" (Lancaster), ""The Big Sleep"", ""Out of the Past"", ""Kiss Me Deadly"", ""The Big Heat"", ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", ""The Killing"", and ""The Asphalt Jungle"".

374594,5,6301863194,"This is one of the MOST superb and enigmatic titles of the Noir Film in any age. After being twenty long years in prison, Victor Mature must infiltrate gang run by the psychopath Richard Widmark who simply ignites the screen with his mercurial performance This is the famous film that offers the brutal and merciless sequence in which gleefully pushes a wheelchair-bound. woman to her death downstairs.

This is to my mind the glorious contribution of Henry Hathaway in this genre.",1126742400,8,481,4.938271604938271
374595,5,6301863194,"Richard Widmark, always known for his wit, had a line like no other when it came to his highly successful transition from radio drama to film.  The slender blonde actor had secured a major niche as a radio performer in the early post-World War Two era, leading him to quip after being asked to transition his talents to film, ""I'm the only actor who gave up a home with a swimming pool to go to Hollywood.""

While others went to Hollywood in search of riches, including a swimming pool, standard fare for affluent performers in warm and sunny Southern California, Widmark left his posh Long Island home and swimming pool behind when he went to Hollywood.  The trip west proved worthwhile for him as well as moviegoers.

The irony was that, while he ultimately moved to Hollywood, his first cinema effort, which resulted in film immortality, the 1947 film noir gem ""Kiss of Death,""enabled him to commute to work from his Long Island home since director Henry Hathaway set it almost entirely in the authentic New York location settings embodied in the story, which was drawn in part from a true life account.  The film represented noir at its most convincing and Widmark at his most chilling.

Filmed in convincing black and white and including prison sequences shot at Sing Sing Penitentiary, Widmark as psychopathic killer Tommy Udo stamped an enduring presence on the cinema world with one of the most brutal and graphic scenes in history.  It comes  when he pushes Mildred Dunnock, cast as the mother of a mob partner that the criminal suspects of squealing on him, down a flight of stairs.  Equally notable was the fact that this film made Widmark's sadistic and sardonic laugh every bit as big a trade mark of cops and robbers suspense films as George Raft tossing his legendary coin.

As Widmark would be the first to acknowledge, for him to garner such accolades from his first role it took a great team effort, and delivering a consummate performance, as Udo's onetime friend and ultimate enemy, was Victor Mature.  As a handsome Twentieth Century-Fox contract player with a great physique Mature was frequently downplayed as beefcake.  His sensitive portrayal of a stickup artist seeking to go straight revealed that he was far more than a handsome leading man for the likes of Betty Grable in light studio musical fare.

Initially Mature spurns assistant district attorney Brian Donlevy's effort to extract information from him in exchange for a lesser prison sentence, sticking to the criminal code of refusing to cooperate with authorities.  Even after Donlevy appeals to Mature's family side as a husband and father of two young girls he is initially undeterred.

Mature changes his mind after spending some time at Sing Sing.  The glib mob attorney, played by veteran Broadway stage actor Taylor Holmes, fails to follow through with his promise to get Mature a pardon through pulling strings.  In the interim Mature's wife is beset by poverty, becomes depressed, and kills herself.  The young daughters he deeply loves are then placed in an orphanage.

His cooperation with Donlevy nets Mature an exit from Sing Sing.  He ultimately takes a regular job and marries Colleen Gray, who had been his children's former baby sitter.  Just when things appear to be going well and Mature has adjusted to the life of a lawful citizen the moment occurs that spin the story toward its ultimately suspenseful conclusion.

A previously confident Donlevy calls Mature with some bad news.  He had cooperated in a case to nail Widmark on a murder rap, but Taylor Holmes' skillful defense cast enough doubt in the minds of the jury to result in a not guilty plea, which set the psychopathic killer back on New York's streets.

Mature realizes that he has more than himself to be concerned about, fearing that the vengeance-minded criminal and his mob will target his wife and children as well.  The drama swings into high gear when Mature plots a strategy to confront Widmark and resolve their differences.  At one point he clashes directly with his old benefactor Donlevy, who asks him to accept police protection and let authorities nail Widmark.

Mature and Widmark hold a tense meeting near the film's conclusion that brilliantly contrasts their styles.  Mature exhibits a steely determination while Widmark waxes sarcasm and delivers his trademark laugh.  The action spins to a final conclusion amid much tension, leaving audiences spellbound and awaiting final resolution.

The crisp dialogue and fast-paced story can be credited to long-time pro Ben Hecht working in tandem with Charles Lederer.  Hecht wrote the script for one of Alfred Hitchcock's top suspense films, ""Notorious,"" with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, released one year before ""Kiss of Death.""",1119484800,15,4763,4.9835651074589125

7816345,5,6301863194,"""Kiss of Death""(1947) holds the distinction of not only marking the film debut of actor Richard Widmark but also contains one of the most vicious murder scenes in film history. That scene, the pushing of a wheelchair bound old woman(played by Mildred Dunnock) down a flight of stairs by gangster Tommy Udo, is not only still shocking but clearly defines the viciousness of the character that Widmark so memorably brings to life. Twilight Time has now brought this classic film noir title to Blu-ray for the first time and the results are once again outstanding. This is the second title from Fox's ""Film Noir"" DVD series that Twilight has upgraded to Blu-ray in the past year(following ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"") and the results should more than please fans of the film. There are no vertical lines, dirt, torn or damaged frames that were a problem with the standard DVD and this new Blu-ray presentation of ""Kiss of Death"" is superb from start to finish. Directed by Henry Hathaway, ""Kiss of Death"" is filmed almost as a semi-documentary that includes a voice over narration during parts of the film. Hathaway's real life depiction of characters and the tragic situations they find themselves in still hits home after nearly seventy years. The B & W cinematography by Norbert Brodine gives the film a gritty look that is even more impressive now on Blu-ray(Bitrate: 26.99). Both interiors and exteriors are very sharp especially during various New York locations used in the film including scenes filmed at Sing Sing prison. Close-ups are another delight and very detailed. You can clearly see the perspiration on the face of actor Victor Mature as his character is being grilled by the police following a jewelry heist. Costumes, vintage automobiles and individual props(guns, photographs, jewelry, etc.) are another standout. The acting is superb with Victor Mature, Brian Donlevy and Coleen Gray giving very believably performances. But as good as they are in their roles, the film belongs to Richard Widmark. His Oscar nominated performance is unforgettable and will stay with you long after the film reaches it's tragic conclusion. ""Kiss of Death"" is 99 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.33:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. The Audio(English 2.0 DTS-HD MA and English 1.0 DTS-HD MA) is crystal clear and contains no noise artifacts(hiss, pops, crackle etc.) Special features include an isolated music soundtrack; audio commentary by film historians Juile Kirgo, Nick Redman, James Urisini and Alain Silver and the Original Theatrical Trailer. There is an informative booklet by film historian Julie Kirgo also included with the Blu-ray. The Blu-ray disc itself is housed in a clear and solid Blu-ray case that is similar to the Criterion cases. ""Kiss of Death"" is one the best of the film noir titles released by 20th Century Fox and Twilight Time's new Blu-ray should be an essential addition to everyone's film collection. It comes very highly recommended.",1488067200,2,2979,5.144329896907217

Andrews Blu-ray Review: With the film KISS OF DEATH [1947] finds grinning gangster Tommy Udo was the role of a lifetime for Richard Widmark, however this is a typical of the characterisation now seems in the context of the late actor's long and distinguished career. As our film begins a narrator informs us over the opening shots of a bustling Manhattan that, Christmas eve in New York a happy time for some people; the lucky ones. Last minute shopping, presents for the kids, hurry home to light the tree and fill the stocking . . . for the lucky ones. Others aren't so lucky. Here we are introduced to Nick Bianco [Victor Mature] a former jail-bird, trying to fly the straight and narrow. After a year of his prison record impeding his efforts to get a legit job, we see Nick Bianco and a few cohorts enter a jewellers office and rob them because, this is how Nick Bianco goes Christmas shopping for his kids. Nick Bianco gets caught at the end of this tense scene where he is seconds away from eluding the police who have been tipped off to the burglary. As he is about to escape their grasp, into the streets of New York, when a cop shoots him in the leg, dropping him to the ground and ensuring his Christmas will be spent at the Graybar hotel. The narrator informs us that this event mirrors the fate of Nick Biancos father who died twenty years earlier with a policemans bullet in his back. He was escaping from a robbery he just committed when young Nick Bianco witnessed his fathers death and sadly enough it was one of his earliest memories. When the violins die down Nick Bianco is looking at plenty jail time but he has a way out.

Assistant D.A. Louis DAngelo [Brian Donlevy] is a family man who tells Nick Bianco that if he sings about the failed heist, he can get out of serving time in the big cage. But Nick Bianco is no canary and refuses to talk even when Assistant D.A. Louis DAngelo tries to push his guilt buttons about his two young daughters growing up without their dad. The Assistant D.A. Louis DAngelo believes that Nick Bianco is a good guy at heart and tries to give him a way to avoid incarceration. We see Nick Biancos wheels turn at the prospect and persuasion put forth by Assistant D.A. Louis DAngelo, but Nick Bianco is old school and decides to do his time with his mouth shut.

Three years into doing his bit in the joint, Nick Bianco finds out that his wife has committed suicide by sticking her head in a gas oven because of financial worries and her drinking too much. Upon hearing the news Nick Bianco wants to get out and take care of his kids who have landed in an orphanage. In prison Nick Bianco gets a visit from Nettie [Coleen Gray] a young woman who used to take care of his daughters and quit and moved away. Nettie and Nick Bianco have a connection and he asks her to keep tabs on his daughters.

Beside himself with guilt and concern for his daughters, Nick Bianco decides to cut a deal with Assistant D.A. Louis DAngelo and give up his crew. Unfortunately this is where Nick must cross paths again with Tommy Udo [Richard Widmark]. Tommy Udo and Nick Bianco had met before when Nick Bianco was being sentenced and they wind up in the same cell for little while. Tommy Udo expressed to Nick Bianco his surprise at being behind bars noting, Imagine me in here. Big man like me gettin picked up just for shoving a guys ears off his head. Traffic ticket stuff. With that statement we understand Tommy Udos idea of a moving violation differs drastically from yours and mine. Tommy Udo proves it later when he has to silence a potential informer and ends up lashing the stoolies mother to her wheelchair with an electrical cord and proceeds to push her tumbling down a flight of stairs. Cementing his dark disposition Tommy Udo gives his legendary creepy cackle at the sight of his maternal manhandling.

Under the guidance of Assistant D.A. Louis DAngelo, Nick Bianco purposely bumps into and pretends to be pals with Tommy Udo to get some dirt on him for the Assistant D.A. Louis DAngelo and the plan works and the D.A.s office is taking Tommy Udo to trial for murder, Nick Bianco testifies against him and everything seems rosy. Nick Bianco and Nettie have gotten married, and Nick Bianco has a regular job and a new identity. His daughters are finally out of the orphanage, living with the newlyweds and happily improving their roller-skating skills on a daily basis. The picture cant get any more perfect until the frame they try to hang on Tommy Udo doesnt take and his slick shyster manages to get Tommy Udo acquitted of the charges he faced. Now Nick Bianco has the psychopath Tommy Udo gunning for him and his family. While he wants to help Nick, the assistant D.A. can only wait for Tommy to violate his parole in order to get him off the streets. That may be too little too late for Nick, Nettie and the girls with a lunatic like Udo looking for payback. Nick sends Nettie and the girls packing to the country and decides to take care of Tommy Udo himself. At this point the cat and mouse game between Nick Bianco and Tommy Udo plays out with both parolees having to tread carefully under the watchful eye of Assistant D.A. Louis DAngelo.

Victor Mature is truly effective in his role as Nick Bianco as he can balance a believable hood with a genuine guy who is motivated by his kids to straighten up from his crooked ways. It could have been played very saccharine, especially in the scenes with the two sweet little girls, but Victor Mature nicely acts out the role and not the dramatic story. The result is a performance that elicits just the right mix of sympathy and compassion for his character. His wistful eyes also seal the deal when necessary too. Perfect casting and acting combined for the crucial role of our protagonist Nick Bianco.

Feature-length Audio Commentary with film historians James Ursini and Alain Silver: This is the same audio commentary that was featured on the inferior DVD release from 20th Century Fox. Here we are introduced to first of all Alain Silver who informs us that he has written and edited a number of books about film noir, including an Encyclopaedia, he is also a Silver graduated from UCLA with degrees in film production (B.A.) and critical studies (M.A. and PhD). Then James Ursini introduces himself and who has also worked on a number of books about film noir, who also has worked on books on the subject of film noir, who has also co-edited with Alain Silver. Also James Ursini is an American writer living in Los Angeles, and an educator. He received his master's degree in Theater Arts and a Doctorate in Film in 1975 from UCLA. Alain Silver and James Ursini really know their stuff, and this audio commentary track is absolutely superb. The pair reflects on the pictures production history and reception, discussing its relationship with other film noir films of that era, especially the semi documentary film noir, and the use of real locations during the shoot and some of the heavy Christian religious symbolism within the picture. They also reflect about the start of the film with the gun on the script, which they feel is a slightly unusual way to start of film, but also reflect it is a very powerful image of what we can expect from a film made in 1947. We also find out that Darryl F. Zanuck wanted to call the film Blind Date, because he felt the main character had a blind date with destiny. They comment on some of the wording printed on one of the pages of the script at the start of the film, where is says, All scenes in this motion picture, both exterior and interior, were photographed in the State of new York on the actual locale associated with the story. But we find out that this is not quite true, but only about 90% of the film was true, especially the outdoor location shoots, but of course some of the interior shots were shot on the 20th Century Fox film sets. We are also informed with a very interesting fact that this is one of the few film noir films that was narrated by a woman, who of course was Coleen Gray, and we are also informed that where the jewel robbery takes place at the start of the film, it was actually in The Chrysler Building, which is the Art Deco-style skyscraper located on the East Side of Midtown Manhattan in New York City and both feel it gave a greater ambience to the film, especially inside the building, instead of being filmed in a studio where they would have to move scenery about and gives a much more subtle lighting. They comment extensively about the actor Victor mature and who they feel in this film alone gave his best performance since his appearance in the film My Darling Clementine, and the critics also like his performance in this film noir film, and Darryl F. Zanuck really liked his performance, because he felt he looked like an Italian thug, especially feeling he resided in the American Italian community. They also talk extensively about Richard Widmarks performance in this film and how it was his landmark debut performance, but unfortunately it haunted this actor for about six or seven years of being typed cast in gangster type roles, until eventually he broke the mould and started to appear in other roles that were so totally different characters. When we get to around the 1 hour 24 minutes where we see Victor Mature has escaped from being arrested goes out to seek revenge on Tommy Udo for the last time, next we are at LUIGIs Sea Food and Cocktails restaurant, well find out with this significant scene is actually the backlot of 20th Century Fox and here we see Richard Widmark with his two goons turn up and where Victor mature sets up the final showdown for the demise of Tommy Udo. But at the same time we also find out that the original ending, which was actually filmed, was where they have a massive shootout on a bus on the streets of New York City and when they saw the rushes, they decided and felt it was not very realistic, because the director was seeking a much more realistic scenario and had to bring Richard Widmark back to Los Angeles from New York City to shoot this new ending and both the commentators that on the East Coast was the original location at the start of the film, and the scene in the restaurant has great tension and suspense set up, especially between Richard Widmark and Victor Mature, to the point at this moment in the film we do not know what the final outcome will be, that is why the director Henry Hathaway did a stunning brilliant job of keeping you on the edge of your set. As we get near to the final fatal shootout, the two commentators say for a 1947 film it was extremely violent, but of course very necessary for the scenario of people getting their comeuppance and the two commentators also comment on the final ending where the actress Coleen Gray [Nettie] makes her final comment on the outcome of life in general and what lies ahead for both Nick Bianco and Netties lives for the coming future and that Nettie has finally got her man and that life is sweet. And so ends quite an interesting audio commentary that is full of interesting facts about the film in general and lots of anecdotes on how they feel the film was portrayed for a film noir and how it deserved the nominations and awards it received and overall the audio commentary is a must for all fans of black-and-white films of the genre.

Special Feature: Interview with Richard Widmark [2006] [480i] [1.33:1] [18:25] The celebrated actor Richard Widmark discusses his acting career where the Hollywood actor was as much at home as the hero or villain in his 50-year acting career, including appearing in the film noir KISS OF DEATH, and talks about the famous scene in the film and the first famous words uttered on screen by Richard Widmark, which went as follows: 'You're Nick Bianco, aren't you? You're a big man. I'm Tommy Udo. Imagine me on this cheap rap  big man like me, picked up just for shoving a guy's ears off his head. Traffic ticket stuff."" Here we get a rare appearance of Richard Widmark in person in conversation on stage at the National Film Theatre in London on the South Bank and the occasion was recorded in July 2002, but only released in 2006 and was part of the Crimescene Festival and the interview was conducted by Adrian Wootton, where Richard Widmark discusses his career and especially his long and varied acting experiences in Hollywood, including the film KISS OF DEATH. This was an edited version of the full interview, and included questions from the audience. We also find out how Richard Widmark perfected that horrible real creepy type hyena laughter. Richard Widmark also offers some anecdotes about the film KISS OF DEATH and its production which will be familiar to many devotees of film noir. We find out that director Henry Hathaway insistence that Tommy Udo to be played by a non-actor, and his choice of a street face named Harry the Hipster, but which are fascinating to hear first-hand from Richard Widmark himself. Richard Widmark also talks about many of his other acting experiences in filmmaking, including his working relationship with the director John Ford. Richard Widmark also reflects on his approach to a certain style of acting. Richard Widmark, who sadly died on the 24th March, 2008 aged 93, was nominated for an Oscar for his first film, KISS OF DEATH. Despite quite a short interview, it certainly packed in lots of information about his acting career and also hearing some very funny anecdotes with working with fellow actors he admired and especially some of the Directors he admired and also had a good working relationship with, especially Jules Dassin, James B. Harris, Stanley Kramer, John Ford, Samuel Fuller, Henry Hathaway, Donald Siegel and some he found to be hard working task masters like John Wayne and Otto Preminger. This is a definite must watch.

Theatrical Trailer [1947] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:21] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film KISS OF DEATH. Here we get an announcement from Walter Winchell describing this dramatic film noir and informing us what Kiss of Death means in gangster lingo, and makes this trailer a very dramatic presentation. But what is very unusual with this trailer is the way they entitle the main actors in the film, by informing us the following way: VICTOR MATURE  The man Who Squeals; BRIAN DONLEVY  The man Whose Friendship Is Fatal and COLEEN GRAY  The Screens New Dramatic Personality.

Finally, if I had to choose one really good reason why I should recommend you watching this film noir film on this Blu-ray disc is definitely the screen debut of Richard Widmark as Tommy Udo and gives a performance that is outstanding, as Richard Widmark doesnt so much give you the  creeps, here he force-feeds them to you. Tommy Udo is a perfect storm of menace, sadist and a total sociopath to make you feel uncomfortable at the same time. Richard Widmark commands every scene in this brilliant film noir film in which Richard Widmark is such a forceful menacing presence and performance that as the film continues, you find yourself just waiting for him to appear. Richard Widmark also gets some brilliant well written classic lines such as telling a cop fishing for information that he wouldnt give him the skin off a grape. Without Victor Matures understated performance Richard Widmarks Tommy Udo may have lost some of his effectiveness by seeming too over the top or out of place contrasted by a less convincing Nick Bianco. The two portrayals, however, balance each other perfectly and create a solid foundation of tension and excitement for this brilliant film noir film that brings all elements together that also brings to the screen a highly charged finale and that is why the director Henry Hathaway was the ideal choice to direct this film to its final conclusion. Highly Recommended!
