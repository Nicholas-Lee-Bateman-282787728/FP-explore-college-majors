8516755,5,B007HNGKF2,Good anime. Although you can buy the whole series to watch off amazon with the amazon app and can stream it to play on your tv or whatevs for only 10 bucks! but if you want a physical copy 200 bucks is kinda steep for a 4 and a half hr runtime. The art seems kinda weird at first but it grows on ya.,1513900800,,299,3.6875
8516756,4,B007HNGKF2,"If you think you might like a historical anime (Edo period) that's rather slow-paced and quiet, character-driven, with beautiful art (in my mind - it is pretty atypical), you totally should try this. If you want plenty of action, though, this is not for you.

The story is about a ronin called Akitsu Masanosuke, who's a bit (or a lot) down on his luck. The problem is that he's very, very shy, and so he keeps on losing one job after another as a bodyguard (cause seriously, who wants a bodyguard who can't even look you into eyes?) Now, in truth he is not quite as undependable as he seems, but he just can't keep a job long enough to prove that.

Then, one day he meets Yaichi. Yaichi is looking for a bodyguard, but he doesn't want a strong one - on the contrary. He thinks he's found his man... well, he's into something of a surprise. Anyway, it turns out Yaichi is the leader of a kidnapping gang called Five Leaves, and unwillingly (but quite inescapably), Masa becomes involved with them.

More than of this gang's adventures as kidnappers, though, the storyline explores their (especially Yaichi's) pasts and their reasons for joining the gang. The art and tone mainly remind me of Mushishi, if anything. For once the back cover blurb hits the nail: ""House of Five Leaves is definitely not a flashy nor a trendy take on the samurai genre. But for true-to-life Japanese culture enthusiast this is like fine tea, best appreciated under the pale moon of a rainy night.""

The reason for four stars is simply that after I saw the anime, I read the manga, and... wow. I loved the anime, but the manga is even better. It's much longer, much more complicated, and reveals many things the anime leaves untold, and after finishing it I found myself a little disappointed with the anime - it could have been even greater! If you liked this anime, you must read the manga. The anime follows it only to the middle of the third part, and heads then to an ending that's quite different from the manga (which, btw, has eight volumes.)",1364256000,2,2028,4.532786885245901
8516757,5,B007HNGKF2,"I've wanted to add this series to my library ever since it came out in 2010. It's quirky nature, wonderful artstyle, and absolutely no plot whatsoever made me always spring with joy. So when I found out that it is finally coming out on DVD in America, I immediately preordered it.

And I have to say, I really have nothing even remotely bad to say against this release. The quality is felt in everything - from the texture of the case to the menu layouts - no details are overlooked or swept under the carpet. It really is absolutely wonderful.

The subtitles are very good also. The translation is accurate, and typesetting does not distract from the enjoyment at all - no need to deal with that ugly yellow font that is so often used. The opening and ending songs feature both translation and karaoke simultaneously.

A special comment must be said about the booklet - it really is beautiful and very well organized. It takes you behind the scenes and gives you a few storyboards which really do show an insight into the animation process.

To be nitpicky, it might have been a bit better if the outside case had the opening to get the disks out on the side instead of the top as it isn't particularly intuitive, but this is of no consequence.

Overall impression - it is definitely worth the money, no doubt about it.",1331856000,7,1320,4.506276150627615
8516758,5,B007HNGKF2,"Sometimes you find a series that you can't seem to praise enough, and this is one of those for me.  It hits an artistic and dramatic sweet spot that I have seen few other places.  All of its strengths give it a high re-watch value, and it's something I expect to enjoy for many years to come.

It is probably the only anime I have seen to so successfully capture a sense of place, and display artistic lighting, to the point that it seems on par with a live-action series.  This moody, slow-paced drama conveys a wonderfully realistic ambiance of old-time Edo (Tokyo), from the rainy nights and frosty mornings, thin-walled rooms with no electric lighting, dim and dank cellars and creaky wood stairs, and muted, natural colors.  The backgrounds are pieces of art in themselves.

The music also contributes to the theme, incorporating both traditional strings and wind instruments, as well as modern ones, to create an evocative and somewhat playful soundtrack.

But it's not just the presentation that's enjoyable.  From our main character, Masa, a big samurai who can't keep a job because he's so shy of people looking at him; to the ever-smirking yet dangerous Yaichi; just the interplay between the people alone makes the series interesting to watch.

The character designs are translated well from Natsume Ono's original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Five-Leaves/dp/1421532107/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Five Leaves</a>&nbsp;manga.  For those viewers who don't enjoy a-typical art, they might look a little weird.  (Though anyone familiar with her earlier works like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/not-simple/dp/1421532204/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">not simple</a>&nbsp;will recognize that her art style here is much more mainstream.)

If you haven't seen this yet and you want a preview, you may yet be able to catch this 12-episode series on Hulu.  I saw it through twice, and individual episodes multiple times, as I was waiting for it to get a US release.

WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU ORDER:
---------------------------------------
This is my first anime purchase from NIS America, so I can't compare it to their other releases.  But this is definitely a nice buy.  The 8""x11"" box is very hard and sturdy, with a nice textured paper covering it.  The front looks like the product picture, the back has another image of Yaichi and Masa.  The opening is at the top.  Inside are two thinpack DVD cases containing the two disks.  The disks and cases are very nicely illustrated, again with pictures of Masa and Yaichi.

Also sharing the box is the accompanying book.  (Its cover, like the box and its contents, is decorated in a busy, watercolor-like patterning.  It's similar to what's seen in the opening sequence, and tending to a pink tint--possibly an homage to Yaichi.)  It reads right to left, like most Japanese books, and has a page devoted to each of the five leaves, another to each episode, and a couple more at the back showing the steps done in animating certain scenes (which I found particularly interesting).

You can watch the series as either subbed or unsubbed (no dub); some honorifics and terms are kept in the subtitles, and are explained in the back of the book.  The DVD extras are minimal: clean OP and ED, and original Japanese trailer, and trailers for other series.  But the book is pretty much the ""extras"" for the series.

I think this is a series that can be appreciated by an audience beyond anime fans.  Anyone who enjoys art, artistic film, or foreign drama, also has as much a chance to enjoy it.",1331856000,14,3678,5.2714776632302405
