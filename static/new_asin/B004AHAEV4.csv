4309388,5,B004AHAEV4,"""A Marine Story"" was one of my favorite feature films at the Beaufort International Film Festival last week. The story line about Alexandra, a Marine who is nearing retirement age, gives the audience a view of a strong, determined and brave woman who also has some personal issues. Still, she agrees to help a resistant, troubled young woman from her hometown buck up and straighten out by training her as though she's already in boot camp.
Alexandra puts aside her own personal and professional issues to mentor someone else, giving her an opportunity to get her life on the right track. In the meantime, Alexandra is trying to do the same, but without much support from anyone else. Her struggles are her own to bear, but she's a Marine. She knows what to do.
The ending was satisfying and timely. You care about Alexandra and her future, wanting a happy ending for her. The film delivers.",1298332800,46,891,4.717948717948718
4309389,5,B004AHAEV4,"I saw this film at The Beaufort International Film Festival, where it won Best Feature Film.  Acting, directing, and editing were all superb.  Very realistic portrayal of the many dilemmas brought to the fore by the DADT policy in the military.  A tight, well-crafted work by all involved.",1298246400,23,289,4.979166666666667
4309390,4,B004AHAEV4,"I saw this at the Rehoboth Beach film festival this year and it was really very well done.  It took a serious, timely topic - that of getting discharged under the DADT policy - and gave it a face.  Both women were superb and the supporting staff was quite good as well.",1290384000,49,269,4.153846153846154

4309409,4,B004AHAEV4,"I was interested in this movie because of the storyline related to gays in the military and being discharged when being found out.  I watched the movie, and I found the subject matter to be treated respectably with no preaching, activism, or anything of the sort to detract from the message.  As a gay man, I wasn't sure if I would want to watch what could be perceived as a lesbian drama, but I was surprised to see the lesbian-themes were subtle with no overt sexual overtones or imagery.  If anything, I found this to be an interesting parallel to the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"" policy defining a central theme of the film.

The majority of the stars of the movie work in the entertainment industry in stunts or behind the scenes work, which explains why they may not be household names.  Dreya Webber has a charismatic charm about her that makes you sympathize with her, respect her, and feel her pain with her struggles.  The story flows at a natural pace with no real lulls.

I gave a 4-star rating because the scenery is beautiful, the scenes are not overdone, and no one really overacted (except maybe a tad for Paris Pickard, but considering her character is out of control, perhaps she was spot-on).  I didn't give 5-stars because a few things that happened were just a little predictable....but entertaining nonetheless.",1430956800,2,1329,4.698275862068965
4309410,5,B004AHAEV4,The movie based on a true story has all the larger than life qualities that that make it more than a memoriable movie worth seeing again and again. And that is exactly what my friends wanted to do. What a great testiment to a women who had to persevere through such adversity and appaling treatment by the country she served. But even more important was the fact that the total injustice done here was beyond disgusting.,1427241600,2,420,4.5394736842105265

4309427,4,B004AHAEV4,"This is an okay flick and if you like USMC-themed stories, you will likely enjoy this film. It is less about the heroine being outed as a lesbian (before the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy) and more about her trying to cope with life after the Corp. Overall, it is an engaging story with some nice twists.",1408838400,,305,4.368421052631579

4309431,5,B004AHAEV4,"It's a very good story. A 40 year old, i assume, marine gets booted from the military because of charges against her of her being gay. She travels home and gets into a fight with people and herself. While helping a young girl shape up and find herself she ends up finding herself along the way. You can get lost with the flash backs that she has and it kind of becomes hard to decipher which part of what she's going through is current and which is the flash back. It all adds up in the end. It's a good story and movie!",1408060800,,520,4.058252427184466

4309438,4,B004AHAEV4,"Very watchable film, although pretty much a B movie, as are most in this genre. Honestly, in the bigger scheme of movie making I would give it three stars. I'm giving it four partly because of Weber and partly because when compared to other gay themed films this one shines a bit brighter than average -- decent plot and dialog, and interesting enough to make it worthwhile. However, the film, again like many in its category, also had a bit of an irk factor for a movie lover like myself. Irk in the sense that I couldn't help thinking that with just a bit more oomph and slightly higher production values this film could have easily been a five star movie, perhaps even a crossover. As for Dreya Weber, she is a much under-appreciated actor. I hope that sooner or later she gets her due. Catch her in 'The Gymnast' if you haven't already.",1405123200,,840,4.461038961038961

4309444,4,B004AHAEV4,"The movie shows a reality that it is hard to come out as who you are as a person. In her case, she is a lesbian. This movie say that it is alright to be yourself. It is a wonderful movie, and I will recommend anybody to watch this.",1404691200,,231,3.7346938775510203
4309445,3,B004AHAEV4,A bit too much violent.,1404345600,,23,3.8
4309446,4,B004AHAEV4,Dreya Weber is absolutely perfect in this role portraying a tough as nails Marine forced out of the Corps. She returns to her small minded hometown to be harassed in the most vicious of ways. Highly recommended.,1403568000,,211,4.72972972972973
4309447,1,B004AHAEV4,"First off, one of the major gripe I have about his movie is giving a message to everyone who are not in the military that the United States Air Force, United States Army, and United States Navy are for sissies. The truth is each military branch has its own responsibilities and specialties.

From the movie cover, you won't even realize that this is a story of a female marine coming out as a lesbian. You might have thought this movie is about ""discrimination"" to women in the military but the movie is pretty much aims at the argument that the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy is discriminatory. In my opinion, that is pretty much far from the truth; but that is for another topic of discussion, not for this review.

Not much of plot and character development since one can pretty much know where the movie will be going based on the ""flags"" set as the scenes progresses.

Even with the aim of making the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy a bad one; the story don't know which way to go. I mean if the story will go the ""show"" and develop the character or if the story will stick to ""show"" that the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy is a bad one. In my opinion, the movie split into into two that did not hold water instead of focusing on one path.

For a movie run-time of an hour and thirty-six minutes (less the opening and closing credits), then it should have been enough to develop one path and make this a good movie.

While watching the movie , there are times where I don't know what is happening anymore or what am I watching. The story is scattered around that I think some scenes are just thrown in to make the movie longer.

Overlaying of music or soundtrack is okay; not too much and not too little.

Overall, this is like watching an afternoon or lunch drama where you can count the number of characters (main, minor, and extras) in the movie without getting lost in the count.",1402876800,3,1878,4.348571428571429
4309448,5,B004AHAEV4,"Didn't know what to expect, but this movie was a well done story about a female Marine released prior to ""don't ask don't tell"". Not the typical story, had a plot and was classy. Recommend it!",1402444800,,192,4.361111111111111
4309449,1,B004AHAEV4,"I am a fan of all films, low budget (like this one), big Hollywood blockbusters, indies, etc.  However, this film has all the elements of a bad movie - A weak script, poor acting, poor directing, poor editing.  Then then put a flattering photo of the female lead on the cover to entice viewers to watch the movie - Shame on the producer.",1402185600,2,337,4.333333333333333

4309455,5,B004AHAEV4,A story about a woman so dedicated and brave for her country. But commits the unforgivable sin of loving another womyn!  So she is thrown out of the Marines.  Such brave boys.  She comes home to the States to rebuild her life.  She helps a troubled teenager with very tough love approach.  She runs into some very tricky people but eventually finds what she's so good at.

It sure did grow on me and was not the typical ""I know what is going to happen next"" kind of film. Actually the way the film and story played out left plenty of surprises and discoveies along the way.

I think there will be a split down the middle as to the view points of the underlying subject matter of the story. However it is very fitting for our modern times and portrays a subject matter that is bound to have you thinking about this film for some time. That alone is rare indeed! Some factual data revealed in the film also made for a more intense contemplation over the whole story.

Watch it alone, watch it with a friend. Either way the experiance will not end when the movie is done playing. This is why I give ""A Marine Story"" a 5 star!",1389139200,,828,4.104938271604938

I sifted through a listing of a number of the free ones, and this one looked interesting. So, I skimmed over a bunch of the reviews..somewhat cringed at the lesbian aspect..but the reviews and movie story looked promising and worthy,and Ma'am - yes, ma'am - it was!
I agree with the other reviewers that the acting was superb; script and story very real, and emotional on many levels; and I was immediately taken in and experiencing them all.

""I wish ignorance HURT"" is a line I won't forget..and boy, ain't that the truth!? And from the top on down.
But 'failure isn't when you fall down..it's when you stay down' and this Marine doesn't stay down, nor does she let a young troubled girl bring herself down.

4309530,4,B004AHAEV4,"'A Marine Story' blends action and drama. The pervasiveness of either genre's tropes affords the story its familiar trajectory and predictable outcomes. Criticisms made of the movie along those lines are understandable. Still, my hunch is that Ned Farr intended to fashion a conventional narrative with a twist that, frankly, is more distracting plot device than a polemic talking point. In its own way, it reminded me of 'Traitor' where everything about the story was familiar save the religion of its hero. 'A Marine Story', like 'Traitor', is a clever and rewarding movie not because of what's obvious about its story elements, structure, etc. but what is not obvious about the subjectivities of its viewer.

Comparisons to 'Traitor' (or 'Billy Jack', or 'Walking Tall') are useful up to a point. However, the protagonists in those movies were, to varying degrees, idealists and their idealism was central to what motivated their actions. My take on the Major Alexandra Everett character is that she has little use for abstractions. She struck me as conforming, dutiful, and unnervingly authoritarian. The character is drawn as a hyper-stereotypical military officer that just happens to be gay. Put another way, this is, as the title pleads with us to realize, a Marine story that coincidentally is a ""lesbian story"" and that's precisely why it so effectively, and coincidentally, ""highlights the absurdity of the military (former) ban on gays"".

The Major is at peace with her homosexuality. True to life, not everyone else is, and she is the victim of institutional discrimination and peer group/community menace. A key element of the story is that her personal identity has nothing to do with her sexual orientation and everything to do with her being an officer in the Marine Corps (her place in family tradition is also eluded to). Problem number one for the Major is that, well, she is no longer a Major. The coerced separation of her self identity from its associated public role is most likely the demon at the heart of her relationship with tequila. Her reactions to institutional discrimination is a reflection of her being a process-oriented realist. She endlessly tries to control the situation (in every increasing self-depreciating contortions) up until the point where it become obvious that she has no control and then, just like a good soldier, she moves on.

Dreya Weber convincingly shines in all aspects of her character portrayal. There is a scene where she ""dresses down"" the Saffron character that would make Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (Full Metal Jacket) proud! She pulls off every ""physical"" scene with authority. Still, the Alexandra Everett character is not one dimensional. Expressions of friendship, warmth, vulnerability, sentimentality, lust, naivety, and joy are pervasive and richly portrayed. Still, for a person like me (i.e. my ""subjectivity"") that is passionately anti-nationalism, anti-war/violence (read anti-military), and anti-authoritarian, Alexandra is hard to ""like"". In fact, I never came around to liking her though I sure as hell would stand at attention and salute if she walked into the room! I'm sure the Major could work with that. As a stereotypical military officer, she would find my reaction of ""respect"" (as the Major puts it, ""submission"") deeply satisfying.

The Saffron character was a missed opportunity given that this story is as much about her as it is about the Major. Paris Pickard works the material skillfully, and she is not the problem here. The character study is just half-baked. The ""brat"" aspect of the character is sufficiently explored, but it's in Saffron's more down-tempo moments that we realize which of the two characters is the more dynamic and thoughtful. The variables that torment Saffron are internal and, therefore, insidious while the Major's are largely external and, therefore, obvious. Both characters are at watershed crossroads in their lives, but it's Saffron who has the most at stake and is the most at risk to implode entirely.

Saffron asked the question in the movie that was most important to me: Can I kill? The character's personal history (her parents were ""killed"", in a manner of speaking, and everyone views the outcomes of her life thus far dependent on that event) makes her the movie's most deserving person to ask that question. The Major's response was as character appropriate as it was lame: A matter of fact analogy involving a choice between drunk drivers and Saffron's family ""alive"" is made. To which I reply rhetorically: In our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, whose side is the ""drunk drivers"" and which side is the ""family""?

Writer and director Ned Farr works this exercise in action and drama deftly, and he seems well equipped for mainstream success if he wishes it. A final note; the car scene with Saffron and her mother was remarkable on about a dozen levels! If you're like me and appreciate hope conflated with melancholy and allegory, that scene will resonate for a very long time.",1337817600,2,5009,5.124847001223991

I recognized Dreya Weber from her appearance in the P90X DVDs, and I wasn't expecting much from her as an actress--you know, here we go with a female Jean Claude Van Damme or Dolph Lundgren.  Man, was I wrong!  Weber carried off this role with intelligence, sensitivity, compassion and (of course!) an amazing physical presence.  The story line is interesting and well crafted; the cinematography is California Inland Empire beautiful; and I especially liked Weber's rendition of the closing song.  The supporting cast was outstanding as well.  Some people may find the theme of don't ask don't tell in the military, and homosexuality in general offputting.  Well, folks, that's real life, and it's time to get used to it.  I have my own questions about the topic as well, but this movie proves yet again that there are no easy answers, either for the gays or the straights.  Come to this film with an open mind and you will be richly rewarded.",1327795200,10,1022,4.7942857142857145
4309542,5,B004AHAEV4,"A Marine Story is very well done.  I was drawn in from the moment the movie began.  It brought tears to my eyes (I can't help it, I'm very emotional). It's unbelievable that this really does happen.  Women and men are not allowed to acknowledge a part of themselves because someone making the rules says it is immoral or unethical to do so.  Not only do these women and men fight for our freedom, the also have to leave their families behind to do so.

All I can say is that I applaud the bravery in this story, I applaud those that brought this story to light.  Thank you. Thank you very much for telling a story that is so very important.",1325635200,2,640,4.204918032786885

This movie beautifully illustrates the biases that are in and out of the military regarding women and sexual minorities. If a man/woman is willing to die for our country who cares what their sexual orientation is. I believe that soldiers that have problem with gays in the military need to learn to control their hatred and realize that discontinuing ""Don't ask don't tell"" was a good thing because our military can recruit and retain talented soldiers who wouldn't otherwise have a chance to save THEIR life!",1325548800,,673,4.711864406779661

4309545,5,B004AHAEV4,"This was a quietly understated, beautiful movie. Really well written and superbly acted. What the end left you with was that justice would be a good thing if applied equally to all.

I thought the scene in the paint-ball was just terrific. Whoever put that together knows something about how paint-ball relates to real-life shooting.

As someone who is a 16 year immigrant to America, I really liked the imagery of the country. I wish more film makers showed more of this America.

As the movie credits close out, don't turn off, there's a wonderful song...sung by the lead actor, Dreya Weber, with some fine harmonies, and a couple of excellent side men (Craig Richey) playing instruments. It's an old traditional song from 1863, but following on from the movie, it has some real pathos. It is performed beautifully, so don't miss it.

I am so glad I watched this movie, it lifted me and filled me with optimism that film-makers are out there trying to tell great stories, without constant explosions, CGI and all the rest of the noisy fol-de-rol of today.

Watch, you won't be disappointed. This is what cinema is supposed to be about.

4309547,4,B004AHAEV4,"I am a huge move buff and somewhat jaded and I really enjoyed this film. Everything about it was very well done and I found it both very entertaining and thought provoking. Don't pay any attention to the reviewers who found it otherwise. This was the first time I had the pleasure of seeing Dreya Weber in a movie and I was thoroughly impressed. She was made for this type of role and did an outstanding and highly believable job. The supporting cast did a great job as well. The epitome of an attractive mature woman who is physically and mentally strong as well as a beautiful human being. It's sad that in reality, society as a whole still puts such a negative value to a person's sexual persuasion when it should be who the person is inside that matters. Though the character she played was atypical of most female marines I'm sure, if I were a marine and someone such as Alexandra Everett was watching my back in a combat situation, I would count myself lucky indeed!

4309549,3,B004AHAEV4,"A Marine Story is a story about a married lesbian enlisted in the Marines who faces adversity due to the choices she has made, namely the failure to conceal her sexual orientation. The film does draw you in, is well paced and holds your attention (3 stars for production), but I can't in good conscience recommend it.  Though it is Not Rated (NR), a more detailed breef summary needs to be included in the Amazon description so an informed decision can be made prior to its potential viewing, due to sexual content. This movie may be seen as offensive to people who hold to traditional marriage, lifestyle, and objective moral values which are based upon Biblical concepts.",1322438400,2,673,4.752136752136752
4309550,4,B004AHAEV4,"I really liked this movie. So far, the only bad things I've read in these reviews had to do with the gay theme or the storyline itself. If you don't like gay people or if you read the summary of the movie and don't find it interesting...don't watch it.

For not being a lesbian herself, Dreya Weber does a wonderful job at making the experience come to life. In this movie, her character was drummed out of the military on suspicion of being gay. So, for the first time in her life, she is learning how to live honestly with who and what she is. One way she comes to terms with herself is by training a troubled and lost teenager who has been court ordered to do jail time or join the military. The teenager is straight, so this isn't a romance. Though there is a lot of chemistry between these two actors. The town she comes back to is one that is in trouble. Being a female ex-marine, she is pulled into some fights that she would rather not be a part of. For anyone who has dealt with coming out or knows someone who has, this story will hit home. It was beautifully told, if a bit slow in the telling. Personally, I like slow movies that require you to sit back and soak it all up. This is more a character movie than an action flick, though the fight scenes are very good. It's fun to watch a strong woman kick a jerk's butt. Again, I stress that this is not a romance. It's difficult for our American minds to come to terms with this as we are used to romance being involved in everything. She does find love, of course, but it is a very small part of the movie. And the point of involving the other woman seems to be more about showing how difficult it can be for these soldiers who have lived in fear of being found out for so long to free themselves. The real story here is about the pain that Don't Ask Don't Tell and the narrow-minded views of homophobic people have caused in this country. However, it is not preachy. It's real.",1322438400,20,1940,4.18716577540107

4309561,2,B004AHAEV4,"I had high hopes for this one since I loved Dreya Weber in The Gymnast. But this one disappointed right from the start with a surprisingly poor script. The premise is about a soldier returning home after being discharged under Don't Ask Don't Tell, but the movie plays more like a dismal soldier returns from duty to a poor hick town and doesn't know what to do with her life so she trains a young delinquent girl to ready her to join the military. Add in a plot about a homophobe who loses an arm wrestling match to Dreya's character and you have one mess of a movie. (stalker, cops, meth lab explosion etc.) Also, the actress who portrayed the recruit was wooden in her acting. The pace of the movie was slow. A brief love scene between Dreya and a woman she meets at a bar was awkward. The only positive is that Dreya's acting rose above the material.",1306108800,13,854,4.34375

4309563,5,B004AHAEV4,"After many years of service in tough, overseas postings, a woman officer in the US Marine Corps - Alexandra Everett  - played by Dreya Weber,  is suddenly accused of being a lesbian, after some anonymous accusations.  She has not been sleeping around, so no one can confirm she is not gay.  She is advised to resign before an official investigation, so she can get an honorable discharge, but won't get her pension as she still has another year to go.  On the day of returning to her sleepy home town she helps arrest some teenagers stealing from a convenience store.  The judge gives the girl - Saffron - played by Paris P. Pickard, a choice between going to jail or joining the military.  Everett is asked by the sheriff to give her some basic training to get her through the first round of selection.  Saffron is very hostile to authority, but as the story progresses we see how things works out for both of them.

I saw this in London at a film festival and ordered the DVD when I got home.  Despite being a low budget movie, with little known actors, it has the look of a much bigger budget production.  The drama unfolds very well and unlike a movie with big stars (where we can usually figure out what the end will be) we have no idea how things are going to turn out, which makes it that much more enjoyable.  Dreya Weber is a professional acrobat and gymnast, so makes a convincing Marine in terms of physique, while still being very attractive.  When she puts on her Drill Sergent act she is really scary.  Paris P Pickard gives a first rate performance as the 'lost  girl' and so do all the other cast members. As well as a serious side to the movie, there is plenty of humor and, very important, one can identify with the characters and feel part of their life stories.

The military scenes had me do a de ja vue.  I hated the military since I was released with ""behavior unsuitable for the military"", meaning I was lesbian.  What was unsuitable was the way I was treated as a human being.

Dealing with life after suddenly being cast outside the military is hard enough without all the other issues of sexuality.
This movie tackled an array of day to day realities within society. Drugs and all the offences and conflicts associated with users and the community. The military and the stigma associated with serving your country. And one womans struggle with all of the issues to breaking point.

I loved the portrayal of Alex. You don't need endless dialogue to convey a strong message. Her body language and decision making processes reflected her strong feelings of dispair, isolation, patriotism loss and anger.
