8172608,4,B000MUVCZ0,Well what can you say about a video that's shows and explains Brain Surgery. It's kinda graphic (blood mostly and showing of a actual brain which to some can be strange). It's a pretty good video and deminstrates real (yes it's not fake and it's actually taken from a actual brain surgery which I guess was shown on TV which I think is kinda strange). But it's got plenty of info and would actually be beneficial to Medical people and anyone who wants to become a doctor or a brain surgen.,1314057600,,489,4.384615384615385
