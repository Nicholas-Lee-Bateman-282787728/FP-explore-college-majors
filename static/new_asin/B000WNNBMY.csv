8224381,5,B000WNNBMY,"This series has been in our family sine it first came out on VHS.  All our kids have enjoyed it and keep asking to play it.  They like the songs, the pictures, ""Spin""'s quirky humor, and they learn something while they are at it.  What more can one ask?  My family wholeheartedly recommends it.",1332028800,2,294,4.388888888888889
