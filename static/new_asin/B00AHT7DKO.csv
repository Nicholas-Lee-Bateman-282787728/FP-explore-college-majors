These movies and documentary clearly explains the concept of Peronismo (Justicialismo) which was neither fully capitalist nor communist but in the middle with preference for the urban workers ( not the peasants) . It explains why Argentina was the only country to help Spain when Franco was totally isolated.,1488672000,,324,5.372549019607843

8551778,4,B00AHT7DKO,"CARTA A EVA. In June of 1947 Eva Pern, Evita, wife of Juan Domingo Pern (elected president of Argentina en 1946) visited Spain. The country was governed by Generalissimo Francisco Franco, victor in the 1936-1938 Civil War against a constitutionally elected government. At the time, Franco's Spain was an international pariah, condemned by the United Nations as an ally of the Axis powers defeated in World War II. Argentina was the only country willing to sell food to Spain, thus Franco was eager to please the Perons. (Spain's postwar isolation was easily dealt with shortly after by opening the country to American bases and joining the anti-USSR coalition. Alliances with Fascism and Nazism during WW2 were forgotten).

Juana Doa was a communist militant, condemned to death for a victimless bomb attack on the Argentine Embassy in Madrid and awaiting execution. The letter of the title is one written by Juana's son Alexis to the Argentine Ambassador asking clemency for Juana on the grounds that the attack was perpetrated in Argentine soil (Argentina did not have the death penalty). The letter fell in Evita's hands who interceded for Juana before Franco and achieved the commutation of her sentence.

The main part of the miniseries is the complex and colorful interaction of Evita and Carmen Polo, Franco's wife. Polo lived in fear of the ""lower classes"" and considered communism a sickness of a perversion; her only positives were, her manners were impeccable and she was quick on the uptake. In contrast, Evita was born out of wedlock in the lower classes, had a genuine feeling for worker's rights and for social justice, a burning ambition to succeed on her own and her manners were not impeccable; her outbursts in lunfardo (Buenos Aires slang) were legendary. 

Production values for this miniseries are first rate. All actors are outstanding, in particular the principals; Ana Torrent as Carmen Polo and Julieta Cardinali as Evita. It was directed, excitingly and with unfailing sense of pacing by Agust Villaronga. The script by Villaronga, Roger Dans and Alfred Prez Fargas is nearly perfect.

LA SOMBRA DE EVITA - VOLVER Y SER MILLONES. The principal merit of this documentary is to give the details of the main plot point of Carta a Eva, the letter written by Alexis (son of Juana Doa) to Evita and her successful petition to Franco to commute Juana's death sentence (she was condemned instead to 30 years of ""hard prison"" but served 16). There is a moving interview with Alexis in his old age.

Unfortunately, the rest of the documentary is not at the same level. No new newsreel footage is offered, the old canard that Peron's campaign was financed with ""Nazi gold"" is resuscitated without any proof, and some of the people interviewed have neither personal knowledge of the Peronist regime or credentials as historians.

JUAN Y EVA. Covers the relation between Pern and Evita from their meeting during relief efforts for the victims of the 1944 devastating earthquake in the province of San Juan until their wedding on October 22 1945, shortly before he was elected by a large margin as President of Argentina in 1946.

Pern was part of a military junta that took power in 1944. As Secretary of Labor he introduced numerous social welfare benefits for unionized workers, established the first social insurance in Argentina and forced employers to provide decent working environments. He restricted conditions under which workers could be fired and established severance pay. Rural workers, until then at the mercy of their employers, were provided with minimum wage, maximum hours and vacations. Grievances were handled by labor courts that frequently ruled against employers.

Not unexpectedly, Peron's activities were seen as anathema by the ""have"" classes, especially landowners. A part of the armed forces required Pern to resign on October 9, 1945 and later arrested him; the pretext was his ""immoral"" association with Evita, who was born out of wedlock and was an actress to boot. On October 17, 1945 workers from Buenos Aires and the industrial belt marched in the millions into the square in front of the Government House and demanded Pern immediate freedom. Cowed, the military agreed and Pern was on his way to the presidency.

Director Paula de Luque moves the story forward with good pacing. Osmar Nez and Julieta Daz impersonate Juan and Eva to perfection, and the rest of the cast is equally good. There are, however, some questions as to the accuracy of the story; for instance, Evita a is shown mostly inactive during the prelude to the mass rally on October 17 1945; in reality, she had connections with labor leaders and had an important part in the organization of the workers. For a different, and perhaps more accurate portrait of the time you may watch also the excellent film Eva Pern: the True Story (1996) by Juan Carlos Desanzo, which chronicles all of Evita's life (she died in 1952).",1391299200,2,4935,5.0
