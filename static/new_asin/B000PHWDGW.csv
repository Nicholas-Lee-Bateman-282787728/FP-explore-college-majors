8218040,3,B000PHWDGW,"To truly appreciate this film one has to watch the hour-long documentary also included on the dvd. This explains how and why these people got together to make this film, how they filmed all of it inside a small house, and it also helps the viewer to understand the limited technology of the time and how different it was compared to today's standards.

For this dvd release the filmmakers decided to trim 30 minutes from the original 90 minute running time. Watching the film can be a bit difficult at times. The quality of the film will look familiar to those old enough to remember watching shows on vhs tapes that had been copied back and forth a coupla times (the movie was shot at the lowest quality setting of the vhs equipment and then copied twice during the editing process making the final version a 3rd generation). Today's young adults will probably have no patience for this poor quality and will most likely dismiss this movie after a few minutes. For those who do continue, what you'll see is a low-budget movie with silly dialogue and some bad acting - however there will be some out there (like myself) who will come away from this feeling a bit nostalgic for these people and for the time and place where this movie came from... A time and place long ago and far far away...",1342051200,,1292,4.521367521367521
8218041,1,B000PHWDGW,"This wasn't funny-in-a-bad-way. This was a few guys with too much money who tried to make a movie, who paid no attention to the script, acting, or anything and just rolled camera.

It is truly unwatchable, and I'm a B-Movie aficionado of sorts.

I'm sorry fellas, I'm sure it was fun to make (it seems like it to me) but the end product is on par with a wickedly embarrassing home movie that should be lost in the basement and never found.",1330646400,,439,4.341463414634147
8218042,3,B000PHWDGW,"The movie opens with an apology for the bad acting claiming they were drinking beer while making the film. It also claims they cut 90 minutes from the original 1983 production shot in super VHS. This movie was done after the McKenzie brother craze was over. Three people in a spaceship have a mission to deliver beer to Nebuli 7-11. They are Slosh, Tank, and Tipsy (who is gay). The spaceships are named similar to beers such as Lionbrau Dark.

The humor spoofs society as well as space movies and Star Trek. It makes fun of ""universal translators"" and ""gravity in space."" They are attacked by a race called ""Probes."" Captain Slosh tells us ""the Probes don't drink beer, but hate anyone who does. Their women are ugly and the never have any fun."" Tipsy responds, ""Sounds like Salt Lake City.""

The unspoken theme to this movie is that the viewer is required to drink a beer when they go to condition ""red.""  The plot is immaterial. The quality is on par with a college project or community TV. Don't bother to view unless you have about a 6 pack per person.

No swearing, no sex, no nudity. Some sexual references.",1312243200,,1114,4.527363184079602
