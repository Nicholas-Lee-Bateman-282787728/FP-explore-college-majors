much worth watching and very interesting to follow the  young peoples  life and  the children and the relatives",1326672000,,133,4.695652173913044
4466041,5,B004TTVS5E,"For anyone who loves the Teen Mom and 16 & Pregnant series, I highly recommend purchasing this season.  I have all of the DVDs, and I love just watching them whenever I feel like it - and WITHOUT commercials!",1325980800,,208,4.333333333333333
4466042,3,B004TTVS5E,"I enjoyed this season more than I did the first season. The only bad thing about this season is Jannelle. I have no idea why she is even on this show. She claims over and over how she is a ""good mom"" but when you watch this season you see just how much of an idiot she is. Her mom is pretty annoying also but I did feel sorry for her.

I really liked Chelsea. Yes she is lazy and mooches of her dad, but in my opinion she is one of the best moms. You can tell she really really loves Aubry and she is so sweet to her. I feel very sorry for her always getting caught up with Adam because he treats her like crap.",1325808000,,611,3.7734375
4466043,3,B004TTVS5E,i was watching the last episode and i cant find where cory and leahs wedding is it just went to the finale special with dr drew which was weird,1319932800,,143,3.9655172413793105
4466044,4,B004TTVS5E,"Wow.  I saw this on Netflix and can't believe that no one has reviewed this yet.  Generally speaking, the girls in Teen Mom 2 seem to be less mature and have even more drama going on in their lives than the ladies in Teen Mom 1.  It wasn't as entertaining as Teen Mom 1 because of all the drama.

For Leah, I thought that she manipulated Corey into getting back together with her.  She tried to use her daughter's disability to get him back.  She would've been better off letting him decide for himself if he wanted to marry her without making him feel guilty about it.

For Jenelle, I think that her mom, Barbara, should accept that she isn't ready to be Jace's mom.  She should give Jenelle a three month time frame to find another place to live and then kick her out for good.  And not allow her to visit Jace unless she has supervision.  Jenelle will eventually grow up, but she won't if Barbara doesn't get tough on her.

For Chelsea, it is great that she has goals and dreams in her life and the support of good friends and family.  She should focus on what she has in life instead of what she doesn't, which is a guy.  Let's face it, she picked the wrong guy to sleep with and get pregnant by.  I hope that she learns from this and moves on.

For Kailyn, she is the person who I most feel sorry for.  I admire her for working hard to support her kid, but I think that she should give up college.  Maybe start her own business or work her way up at her job.  I think that she made a dumb decision dating someone while she was living with Jo.  I think that it was wrong for his mom to get involved in his relationship with her.  I think towards the end especially in the last interview, Jo realizes that he treated her badly and feels some remorse for it.  I hope that he accepts that it is over between them and tries to be a good co-parent with Kailyn.  With Kailyn, I hope that she continues to work hard and makes better decisions for the guys she picks to be apart of her life.

I will never judge or be harsh with the families' who are not supportive of these teen moms-the fathers of their children or their parents.  Remember all of these girls never asked the other people who are now involved in financially supporting or baby-sitting these kids what they thought about them keeping their children.  I know if my daughter was a teen who had a baby, I would strongly encourage her to give the baby up for adoption because I know that I would end up taking care of the child while she was growing up-just like most of the grandparents are doing now.  I would also be a little bitter if I had to send a check every week to someone I barely knew because we had a child together.  I guess part of growing up is knowing that your choices have consequences and sleeping with someone who you are not willing to make a commitment to is not a good choice.",1314921600,2,2860,4.190476190476191

8440935,1,B004TTVS5E,"Teen Mom and Teen Mom 2 have a huge problem with their DVDs. Whenever an episode runs more than the standard one hour (about 40 minutes without commercials) the DVDs cut that episode short. The Teen Mom 2 Season 1 DVDs cut the episode where Leah and Corey marry, cutting out the entire wedding, which for many was the highlight of this season, if not all of Teen Mom 2! This continues to happen with Teen Mom/Teen Mom 2 DVDs. The final season of Teen Mom was recently released on DVD and the final episode of Teen Mom ""Wake Up"", which was an extra long episode, was cut. Only the first 40 or so minutes is shown on the DVD set, despite it being a 90 minute episode. MTV/Teen Mom really need to fix this issue with the DVDs. Majorly disappointed!",1353110400,12,745,4.290780141843972
8440936,4,B004TTVS5E,"The only problem I had with this product was that they cut the finale short. I saw it on TV,and the DVD leaves out all the endings. But other than that,I didn't have any problems. The DVDs work totally fine. I would say Teen Mom 2 has even more drama than Teen Mom. A lot of it comes from Jenelle,who can't seem to get her life together. I think she should have given her kid up for adoption,she's not fit to be a mom. It's hard to watch Chelsea constantly going back to Adam. I wish she could gain the self-respect and confidence to realize Adam does not treat her right. She is really good mom,though. Kailyn's story is also full of drama. You can see she had a rough life and Jo is definitely not the right guy for her. Lastly,there's Leah. I don't hold much respect for her,I don't see how you can cheat when you have two babies at home. That wedding was a huge mistake,I know the ending to that and they never should have gotten married. I can't wait to watch season 2.",1347667200,,974,4.1861702127659575
8440937,4,B004TTVS5E,"I love having the show on DVD, especially since I can't watch it on TV but the part I don't like is they cut off the finale. I saw a previous reviewer said something similar and I thought maybe it was a one time thing. Nope! They completely cut the finale. You never see the endings to any of the stories, especially Corey and Leah's wedding. It goes straight to ""On the reunion special"" previews. Totally Lame. Other than that it didn't have any problems.",1327536000,5,456,4.376470588235295
