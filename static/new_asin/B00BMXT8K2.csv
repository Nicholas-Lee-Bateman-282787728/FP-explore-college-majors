5656523,5,B00BMXT8K2,"I am a huge fan of groundbreaking comedian Andrew Dice Clay and am glad to see him back in action.  I just wish that the DVD had been packaged inside a standard DVD hard plastic case and not into a cheap cardboard sleeve.  Nevertheless, the Dice Man still rules!",1391817600,,262,4.326530612244898
5656524,5,B00BMXT8K2,does not disappoint.  has alittle repeat material but overall a pretty damn disgusting act.  nothing quite like good old fashion dice.,1389052800,,134,5.333333333333333
5656525,5,B00BMXT8K2,it was great andrew at his best i would say i have watched it a few times now and will watch it again,1388016000,,101,3.4347826086956523
5656526,5,B00BMXT8K2,Dice killed on the dvd like he was at Madison Square Garden all over again. Unless of course you are not a Dice fan like my wife. However it came in a cardboard case and that #!d me the h#/^ off! Who does that for $2.95 shipping and handling?,1385424000,,242,3.9591836734693877
5656527,4,B00BMXT8K2,"I wasn't a big fan when Dice was a big thing. I was busy with life and the only comic I continued to follow from childhood was George Carlin. I did note the fanatical following but also the equally fanatical backlash. I ended up meeting him one day and realized what a nice family man he was and also that he had to be clever to create such a popular and polarizing character so I investigated,picked up some old CDs and DVDs and was entertained. I did notice a big fall off in quality after his big MSG show however, the DVDs after that really were bad imitations of his earlier act and even his shtick was a bit laughable. Being a big fan of comics I decided to give him another try and as you can see bought this from Amazon.com.

I guess they plan on selling these at shows and through the mail only because it comes in a paper sleeve so thin you may not even believe a DVD is inside. the show is a bit slim as well coming in under 50 minutes ... with opening bits etc. BUT, it is a really funny funny show! Dice is very much like his better , younger self , but he's a bit self effacing throughout which is quite helpful and his treatment of his and in general men's aging is a fresh bit for him. While the Dice Rules DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dice-Rules-The-Andrew-Dice-Clay-Concert-Movie/dp/B00DQM028Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dice Rules: The Andrew Dice Clay Concert Movie</a>is a coronation at the height of his popularity, this is by far the first worthy follow up and it was about 20 years in the making.

If you were a fan I can recommend this without question. I can't give it 5 stars though .  It may be funny but it's short , there are no bonus features and the price isn't super cheap so its value for money ratio is very good not great. To compare, you can get Lawrence Of Arabia on Blu Ray with hours of bonus features for ten bucks and that is a stone cold 5 stars. It is well filmed and widescreen , definitely the best presentation he has had since his heyday of Madison Square Garden.

If you only remember the dismal follow up DVDs and are tentative... take a chance you will enjoy it.",1379030400,12,2163,4.468354430379747
5656528,3,B00BMXT8K2,"The Diceman is done. He needs to find another line of work. Comedians have to evolve, and with this show, it seems like ADC had devolved. 3 stars only because I remember when he was a guilty pleasure.",1378252800,5,200,4.2894736842105265
5656529,5,B00BMXT8K2,I just received this and just watched it. It is very entertaining. A bit raw and vulgar but he does do it in a fun way. Overall I found it worth the time just to hear some very funny things.,1377561600,,190,3.775
5656530,5,B00BMXT8K2,"Maybe I totally forgot... yeah, that must be it.  I remember watching Andrew Dice Clay back in 1996.  That was when I was becoming a teenager and my dad and his ex-girlfriend were debating if I was old enough to watch it.  I was 14.  They eventually gave in and let me see it... and I haven't been right since!  Now, 15 years later, he's back!  I had NO idea Andrew Dice Clay actually took time off from the big stage all these years.  I did often wonder what happened to him.  He had a sitcom I believe, and I'm pretty sure it never became much of a success.  Obviously he couldn't be himself on such a show, which means it was destined to fail.

Anyway, if you're worried that Andrew Dice Clay has mellowed out in his old age, you are 100% wrong!  Indestructible shows a man STILL extremely talented, still remarkably inappropriate (for *all* age groups, hehe!) and still obsessed with sexual-related humor.  As we all are... and don't lie!  The sexual stuff is why you're watching this in the first place!  It's alright to admit it.  It's the reason I'm watching it too!

Sex, the endless ways one can pleasure yourself, sperm in all its graphic gory details, all the private part interpretations and comparisons you can imagine... this is probably the best performance he's ever done.  It's *that* good.  It's INCREDIBLY offensive.  He picks on certain members of the audience which is always a good portion of any comedy routine, and he's pretty hard on them which means more laugh out loud moments for us.  Andrew touches on the subject of today's technology with emails, Anthony Weiner, and today's generation of excessively sex-hungry women.  The part about Twister (the board game) is a highlight, as is the viagra side effects if taken the wrong way (lol), but realistically the entire SHOW is a highlight!  You know what you're getting into with Andrew Dice Clay so there's no need for me to reiterate what you already know you sicko, hehe.

Oh yeah, and the nursery rhymes.  He does that segment too!  Can't remember if these are the same exact jokes from years ago or slightly altered jokes.  They do sound familiar so I'm inclined to think they're the same jokes.  Also, this performance takes a few minutes to get underway since apparently his children are adults now and play the drums.  Be prepared for a slow start.  Overall, VERY funny, offensive, drop-off-your-couch-in-tears style of laughter that only Andrew Dice Clay can perform without missing a beat.  He's absolutely the funniest comedian whenever I'm in the mood for such filth!  No doubt about it!",1372550400,4,2576,4.708520179372197
5656561,2,B00BMXT8K2,OK. Still don't think he's funny. I was hoping he was going to do a Bobcat Goldwait and lose the persona along with getting all new material.,1508457600,,141,4.2592592592592595

5656568,1,B00BMXT8K2,"It embarrassing frankly.  The grey sideburns and more gaunt appearance yet the same sort of college shtick like ""I went out with this Puerto Rican girl and I @*#% her so hard her #$&* popped out.""  Is this really what this 'comedian' believes people are clamoring for?  I watched approximately five minutes minutes, fast forwarded to the middle and it was as if the same joke was suddenly ending.  I am no prude, but the material is so dated and having this come from his mouth is tantamount to that older man at the end of a bar hitting on a twenty something group of women; uncomfortable and unfunny.  Sorry Dice, this was tacky and not my cup of tea.  For those die hard fans, maybe you will appreciate it.  I for one, had the chuckle leave me since it's 2017 outside.",1497916800,3,771,4.387323943661972

5656582,2,B00BMXT8K2,"Andrew Dice Clay: Indestructible is a slow, painful walk through ground that has not merely been trod before, but which has since fallen fallow. In this desolate expanse of humorless vulgarity stumbles an aging, balding Dice who, embarrassingly, has not changed one bit since I was a senior in high school. The achingly slo minutes from 0:00 to 7:35, with less than 50 minutes left in the special, are full of self-indulgent prattle informing us of how great Dice [still believes he] is. When he and his receding hairline finally take the stage in Elvis glasses, it is a relief... until he starts talking.

Two minutes into his routine and he's being unabashedly homophobic in what is a completely unfunny piece of almost-crowd-work from behind goggle-like glasses that would make Elton John proud. The subject matter isn't what pains me, as all topics are fair game for comedy. It is the fact that there is no comedy to be found until roughly 11 minutes in (when you could argue the stand-up routine finally starts).

Somehow wringing sitcom-like laughter from his audience, Dice -- now in his fifties -- inspires cringing self-pity. The corny outfit (which, like his routine, is unchanged from 25 years ago) looks like a costume, not like wardrobe. 15 minutes into the routine and I still hadn't laughed. Dice was doing a routine about what he'd say to God in Heaven -- foolishly assuming that he wouldn't be roasting in the deepest fires of Hell for inflicting this special on the world.

Nearly 23 minutes in, he's talking about cybersex, honest to God cybersex, in material that would have been cutting edge about two decades ago. It's almost like Dice is working off notes he jotted down the last time anybody cared in 1993. Dated references to Weebles and other pop-culture that no one under 40 will get only make you wish he'd go back to haranguing the crowd.

Speaking of crowd work, Dice's idea of working the audience looks a lot like sexually harassing the women in the first few rows. There's nothing wrong with this. You could argue that it's expected of him based on the brand he built in a less politically correct time. But it falls flat here. It isn't funny, yet it isn't offensive. You don't get the sense he believes it; it's more that he's doing a schtick that was tired when ""Brain Smasher: A Love Story"" first belly-flopped its way into theaters. His use of various epithets and put-downs feels calculated and even cynical, not earnest and raw.

""Only two kinds of people sit in the front of a Dice show,"" he says at one point in the special, careful to mention himself in the third person lest we forget who we're dealing with. ""People that never saw me before, and people maybe maybe want to end something that's gone on a little too f--ing long.""

I agree. I made it only half an hour into the special before realizing that it had, indeed, gone on a little to f--ing long.",1497139200,2,2898,4.6614481409001955
5656583,5,B00BMXT8K2,"As crude as ever firing off like a machine gun or some other well tuned oily machine. He came out of Vegas with one hell of a tight act.

5656584,1,B00BMXT8K2,"He is horribly disrespectful to women and talks disgusting just for the sake of being disgusting. I tried to give him a chance, hoping that he would start actually being funny. Then I realized something... in the video during one of his ""jokes"", he talks about having to hide and says ""... having to hide like Hellen Keller in the attic..."" If he is that dumb that he confuses Hellen Keller and Anne Frank, then why am I trying to understand his type of humor??? And what makes it even worse is the fact that HE is actually JEWISH!!! And doesn't know who Anne Frank is! SMH... I honestly don't understand how people can find him funny, except that maybe the people who relate to him are just like him. And if there are THAT MANY people in this world, it saddens me because we are doomed.",1495152000,4,787,4.360544217687075

He's never told a clean joke in his life; and we like him that way. You can never call this man a 'sell-out'.
