4372946,5,B004GHNG6I,"One of the most controversial documentaries of our time has been available for digital download for several months now, yet many in the mainstream are still unacquainted with the ideas, concepts, opportunities and challenges presented by the coming Technological Singularity. Perhaps this shouldn't  be too surprising, many of us live in the mundane, harsh reality of the now. Day to day life, war, debt, unemployment, death and  taxes are difficult enough to grapple with without taking time out to contemplate the vast implications of a Technological Singularity predicted to emerge sometime between 2029 to 2050.

4372948,4,B004GHNG6I,"The documentary was very nice and presented different sides of the issue. People who rate the film based on whether or not they agree with the guy (Ray Kurzweil) lack the ESSENTIAL ability of entertaining ideas that they presently disagree with. I enjoyed seeing and hearing what various people believe about the future of humanity and technology.

The main reason I am giving this review is because the film hardly mentioned the idea that the human mind might be the limit of controlled complexity that the universe can hold. Instead, it assumed that the exponential growth in information technology would go forever and would far surpass our mental abilities. In fact, the growth is logistic growth, which appears exponential in the beginning but levels off. The million-dollar question is: ""when will the growth level off?""

I couldn't help but think (especially when he was shown popping hundreds of pills), that the guy has some emotional issues, which seem very connected to his beliefs that were presented in this film. There certainly are no factual reasons for his CERTAINTY.",1308960000,4,1084,5.084269662921348

There was nothing concrete or usable. When it really got boring they would throw in a celebrity or two as Colin Powell or William Shatner to spice it up a tad. I know this presentation is really an attempted biography but still falls short of its purpose.

Basically it went from the possibility of improving man then machine then eventually building the ultimate man/machine as in the film ""Over Sexed Rugsuckers from Mars"" (1989).

I did like looking at the old-time computers and bygone personalities.",1306886400,,680,4.844827586206897
4372951,5,B004GHNG6I,"Transcendent Man is an Absolute Must See

If you care about the future, have any interest in the recent history of computing, invention, or Ray Kurzweil, you must see this film.  While some may disagree with particular themes, ideas, or points, the general discussion, the examination by other futurist, and the insight presented by Ray are compelling.

The presentation of reading machines, the endorsement by Stevie Wonder, and the progress documented over the last three decades show strongly the amount of improvements made in the lives of people.  It was uplifting to see the benefits.

The clear and graphic explanation of The Law of Accelerating Returns is the most important and profound part of the movie.  While the future is unknown, the impact of Ray's ideas and his powerful method of explaining it to others remains the most influential part of the work.

The director framed a difficult, controversial, and somewhat complex set of ideas in a thoughtful, moving, and clear way.  One cannot help but be impressed and moved at both the rate of change and the remaining complexity we must aggregate to over time.",1306108800,,1123,5.0
4372952,2,B004GHNG6I,"I'll edit this review with more thoughts in the future, but having just seen the documentary I wanted to make some observations. Transcendant Man seems lost and poorly organized. Its seems to flutter back and forth between being an argument for the singularity, a documentary about the singularity, and a documentary about Kurzweil himself. For the first third or so Ray is treated rather hagiographically. Thankfully that peters out, but more criticism of Ray and his ideas would have spiced things up and kept things fair. Disturbingly, some criticism of Ray seems to have been edited out dishonestly. There was a brief clip in the trailer where a man says something to the effect that Ray is a charlatan selling techno-optimism because doing so makes him a lot of money. Then he says ""That's wrong."" In Transcendant Man, the same guy appears, briefly talks about Ray setting himself up as a kind of prophet with the conversation obviously leading up to the accusation from the trailer. Then suddenly there's a very conspicuous jump to the guy saying ""That's wrong."" It seems the editor wanted to blunt that criticism of Ray by omitting the accusation of being in it for the money. Pretty much all of the singularitarians in the documentary come off as having a few screws loose. Ben Goertzel came a across as an eccentric hippy. In one scene he's wearing a cowboy hat with a cowspot pattern. His speech slurred. I could very well believe he was stoned during filming. Hugo de Garis came off as being somewhat obnoxious. Even Ray didn't seem as articulate as he typically does in his talks.

As an immortalist I want to live as close to forever as practical, and I hope science devises the means for me to achieve this. Whether its anti-aging research or mind uploading, whatever helps me live longer. I can say that my interest and optimism for these prospects is not motivated by fear of death, but just a desire to experience as much of the future as possible. I thought the same would naturally be true of Ray and have generally felt dismissively towards critics arguing that singularitarianism is rooted in the fear of death. After watching Transcendant Man I'm less inclined to be dismissive of the critics and more inclined to be suspicious of Ray. I can only speak of impressions, but he really does seem to have issues about death, especially that of his father. He seems really tore up about his father's death even beyond the difficult grief of having lost a close loved one.

Oh and some of the visual effects were obnoxious. Like when Ray would describe the singularity and white text on a dark background would repeat what he said, and the text would rotate and jumble up. That was pretty awful.",1301616000,16,2711,4.741525423728813
4372953,5,B004GHNG6I,"Sure there is the technical stuff and the robots and the idea of singularity, but more than that what struck me was the soft spoken Ray Kurzweil gently saying, 'No' to death. He intends to invent his way out of it. The documentary explains how all this might happen and I am not even going to pretend that I am being balanced here. I love this guy! It was a pleasure to see him speak at the Screening. I was sitting in the balcony and the normalness of this man astounded me. Someone who invented the flat bed scanner, helped the blind to read, made a robot create music, went to M.I.T, is really not an introverted geek. I was expecting a large headed man in a white labcoat. Instead there he was standing in a checkered jacket, telling us that how the computer that once occupied the whole room now sits in our pockets. How far are we from this pocket sized machine going into our blood cells? Just as we don't feel the earth moving around the sun at thousands of mile per hour, we are also perhaps unaware of how quickly things are changing. Ray also spoke about a pill that may allow us to eat all we want without gaining weight. These things are in play. And then he sat down to watch the Transcendent Man. It was weird watching the film and also being able to see Ray sitting in the same room. In one scene he wore the same jacket that he was wearing that evening. Anyway I will end this most balanced review now. Just watch it!

4372963,4,B004GHNG6I,"An insightful movie for all to watch.  If I didn't know there is a God Who has an eternal life in store for me...the movie's idea would make sense.  The problem is that mankind is trying to accomplish what only God will do -- and NOT by upgrading our bodies in the sense of Transcendent Man.

Nevertheless, I respect Ray Kurzweil. He believes that human and artificial intelligence will synthesize at some point in the future, blurring the line between man and machine, a transformation he terms ""The Singularity.""  Personally, I see a lot of flaws with this idea although I understand why Ray believes in it.  One flaw is that we must acknowledge that only a few will be able to pursue this dream: it's one more way to separate the wealthy elite from the middle and lower classes.  After all, who could afford to do anything that is being proposed but the elite?  And it will never change the heart of man which is ""deceitfully wicked.""

We have a choice to seek the God of the Bible OR to deny Him.  It's everyone's choice, just as it is a choice to  choose to be an Atheist OR not..

Still, I recommend to Christians especially to watch this documentary to understand what is presently going on in the world.  These sorts of things are never discussed in churches.  And if you mention it, people look at you like you have 2 heads.  We need more watchmen on the wall to educate most ""church Christians"" and to explain how and why it differs from what God has intended for those who believe in Jesus.  We also need to wake up to the way in which the world is headed.  It's NOT sci-fi; it's science NON-fiction.  The world is headed for a one-world government and this plays right into that plan

I can only give this film 4 stars because it does not promote my beliefs; however, it rates 5 stars to me because it makes for a good eye-opener and teaching tool.",1452816000,,1860,4.388888888888889

4372977,3,B004GHNG6I,"Transcendent Man is a documentary about the life and ideas of Ray Kurzweil, a successful American inventor and author of the book The Singularity is Near. The documentary shows him hobnobbing with both Colin Powell and William Shatner, later turning up at an event featuring Barack Obama. Stevie Wonder is another celebrity interviewed. Kurzweil's association with Shatner (Captain Kirk in Star Trek) is perhaps symbolic.

Kurzweil is a believer in the law of accelerating returns and exponential technological progress. He claims that a new evolutionary leap will take place around the year 2040, when a state he calls the singularity will be reached. At that point, machines will acquire super-human intelligence, and nothing will ever be the same. The documentary discusses both Artificial Intelligence, nanotechnology, the potential immortality of the physical body, genetic engineering, and the creation of new human bodies through computer-generated virtual reality. Kurzweil himself imbibes mysterious pills which supposedly reprograms the biochemistry of his body, thereby extending his life span. (This interests Shatner, who says he doesn't want to die.) When talking to Powell, Kurzweil claims that all our energy needs can be taken care of by highly advanced solar panels. If this sounds like science fiction, it probably should. Indeed, The Terminator is explicitly referenced in the documentary, and other ideas sound strikingly similar to those in The Matrix. This makes the pairing of Kurzweil and Captain Kirk look pregnant with meaning!

A couple of critics have been included in Transcendent Man, but most of them don't really question the idea of eternal technological progress. Rather, they believe that the machines may turn evil, or that immortality is much further away than 2040. Interestingly, the really serious criticism comes from a biologist and a Christian talk show host. The biologist, whose name escapes me as I write, argues that evolution always comes with both costs and benefits, so even if humans achieve longevity, some other traits will probably devolve or disappear. The Christian, none other than Chuck Missler, believes that Kurzweil's talk about the singularity is really a false, pantheistic religion. He's on to something there!

It's painfully obvious that Ray Kurzweil really has created a kind of false religion, pseudo-religion or new religion. I say painfully since Kurzweil freely admits his strong fear and loathing of death, especially his own impending death and that of his already deceased father. Apart from personal immortality through dietary supplements, Ray wants to bring his dead father back to life by making a computer program simulate the father's body and thoughts. I get the impression that Kurzweil is a hyper-intelligent person who simply can't stand the idea of his own physical mortality. I do think he is an idealist, who really believes he is doing humanity a favor. Yet, the pseudo-religious overtures are obvious. The singularity scheduled to take place in 2040 is Kurzweil's apocalypse or rapture. The immortal physical or virtual bodies of man are resurrection bodies (or perhaps Taoist immortal bodies, in the case of the dietary supplements). The enhanced Artificial Intelligence is, of course, God. Kurzweil seems well aware of the similarities between his ideas and those of Christianity, even speaking at a Christian conference. He even says that God doesn't existyet.

Even more obvious parallels can be drawn to Aurobindo's Gnostic Man or Teilhard's Omega. What can only be achieved by God's direct miraculous intervention or a spiritual evolution, Kurzweil hopes to achieve through enhanced technology. Here, he is similar to Nikolai Fyodorov, the first of the Russian Cosmists. What I find remarkable is that so many of Ray's colleagues accept his basic scenario, despite its obvious roots in religion, Cosmism or science fiction! Or perhaps not so remarkable: Kurzweil has simply taken the quasi-religious implications of the modern idea of Progress to their logical and fully conscious conclusions. Of course, the idea of Progress is in itself an immanentized version of both postmillennial and premillennial Christianity and Judaism, wedded to the 19th century progressive distortion of Darwin's evolutionary thought.

Here, somebody could argue: but it's true. Except, of course, that it isn't. The truth claims themselves are religious in the most negative sense of that term: blind faith. This is obvious throughout the documentary, where Kurzweil's admirers constantly resort to the argument from authority, genius or previous prediction when claiming that Kurzweil must be right about The Singularity, as well. Somebody even calls him a modern prophet A more dispassionate look at things shows that we are already on the brink of the abyss, and that Kurzweil's whole idea of humans breaking free from their physical constraints by technology is sheer illusion. On the positive side, this also means that the dystopian speculations about terminators or artilect wars are equally bogus. (Tribal wars are far more likely!) As for Kurzweil's idealism, well, AI developer Hugo de Garis says in the documentary that he *is* willing to destroy the human race in order to build an advanced machine-brain. I'm sure De Garis is a really N.I.C.E person

When juxtaposed against interviews with his critics Kurzweil seems a lot flakier here than he comes across in the book.

As with all good documentaries this one tries to present both sides of a debate and let the viewer decide for themselves.  However some of the ideas presented here are complex, take time to explain and were glossed over too quickly to resonate with viewers who might not have read the book.

4373001,5,B004GHNG6I,"This movie provides an intriguing introduction to Ray Kurzweil, who claims that humans will gradually merge with their technology and become, as the title indicates, transcendent man.  Kurzweil argues that our technology is advancing at an exponential pace, and we are reaching a point where the exponential curve will be more vertical than horizontal.  The problem for our expectations is our day to day existence: we generally experience tech growth linearly, and thus today don't realize how radically our lives will change over the coming decades.

Kurzweil (from the movie): ""When I went to MIT in 1965  I went there because MIT was so advanced in 1965 that it actually had its own computer.  It took up half the building, cost $11 million . . .  The computer in your cell phone today is a million times smaller, a million times cheaper, a thousand times more powerful  thats a billion-fold increase in price-performance that weve seen in computation in the last forty years.

""So we went from a building to something that fits in your pocket in 40 years.  In the next 25 years well go from something that fits in your pocket to something thats the size of a blood cell.

""The reason that information technology grows exponentially is that we use the latest technology to create the next.  Each new generation of technology grows exponentially in terms of capability, and the speed of that process accelerates over time.

""Even biological evolution, long before even humans evolved, shows the same phenomenon.  The very first paradigm of biological evolution was the evolution of DNA.  That took a billion years.  But then evolution adopted it and has used it ever since.  So the next stage, the evolution of the Cambrian explosion, when life and animals evolved, went 100 times faster.  That took 10 million years.  Then after a few more steps, the homo sapiens, the knowledge-creating species, took only a few hundred thousand years.

""Evolution then shifted from biological evolution to technological evolution.  It took tens of thousands of years to evolve stone tools, fire, the wheel.  Then we always use the latest technology to create the next technology.  So the whole pace of technology has accelerated.  Major paradigm shifts like search engines evolved in just 5 or 6 years.

""The reason we get to a Singularity, a point of astonishingly quick change, is because its going to go into very fast gear over the next several decades.""

Kurzweil, of course, has plenty of critics.  As Neil Gershenfeld, Director, The Center for Bits and Atoms at MIT, puts it: ""What Ray does consistently is take a whole bunch of steps everybody agrees on, and take principles for extrapolating that everyone agrees on, and show they lead to things that nobody agrees on.  And you shoot the messenger because the extrapolation leads to things that just seem crazy.""

I think most people will find this movie illuminating and highly recommend it.",1410393600,,2940,4.957055214723926

He follows his passions with the goal of ensuring every human being has the right to feel and express, experience and grow, evolve and embrace their physical and intellectual potential.  His inventions have inspired and assisted inventors to provide tools for those who have physical challenges.  His tenacious audacity to proclaim that transcendence is next step in evolution causes debates and unsettled predictions among mathematicians, physicists, and computer engineers. He has even challenged biologists and medical strategists to look at the concept of life and the human body differently.

He may be eccentric, he may be just a hair on the edge between brilliance and crazy, he might even be overly idealistic in how he perceives humans will use technology for the betterment of humankind, but he hasn't been wrong yet.  This documentary/movie shows him at his highs and his lows, it provides incite into his personal journey of life in death, and it provides the viewer inspiration to the possible.  What if exponential growth propels the technological development of artificial intelligence? Watching this movie play out raises concerns and questions of philosophy, ethics and spiritual understanding. Technology is moving faster than we (normal folk) are able to discern its consequences.

I have shown this DVD to 8th graders and watched their eyes widen with questions from; ""Is this real?"" to ""What does this mean and will it change my future?"" even near the end of the school year their views and perceptions of the implications in this movie brings fresh enthusiasm and guarded responses in their writings about literature, science, math and global conflicts.

I dearly hope people realize there are potentials in our own DNA that ARE godlike and infinitely intelligent, capable of traveling through the stars with the power of thought and belief, I hope this realization occurs before A.I. nanobots replace carbon based life with silicon based life, before synthetic humans are considered better because they have more physical strength.

4373027,3,B004GHNG6I,"The point of this movie is a sort of documentary about Ray Kurzweil and how he is good at predicting technology that will be present 10 or more years down the line.  It reminded me of the programs on Discovery Channel etc. that talk about advances in technology.  That is why unless you have a specific need to watch this program I don't think it is worth paying a rental fee.

That is not a negative thing. I did find it interesting, although I don't agree with all his predictions.  He talks of implants that will connect your mind directly to the internet, that being a cyborg will be the norm, and as suggested by the title our minds will able to be backed up to a point that we will live on even after we die, kinda like the Johnny Depp movie.  Those are just some of the things the program talks about.  I am more of a skeptic because real life doesn't work like that.  Technology doesn't work like it does in the commercials.  If it did tech support wouldn't have anything to do.  Then add in economic and business issues that adds up to a lot of people even in the USA not having access to things that other people have.

The program is well balanced.  They have other experts who disagree with his predictions stating that some are more in line with wishful thinking or a kind of naivety.  In short, it was interesting but not more interesting that what is on basic cable.",1398902400,,1381,4.310077519379845

It becomes very clear in the film that Ray is not in the pragmatic camp.  His viewpoints are visionary but he is fooling people to believe that his visions are based in science.

When has exponential growth ever been applied in reality?  Exponential growth is an easy topic for high school level or college mathematics.  Easy in theory.  In real application, exponential growth never runs to infinity.  Population growth... good example.  There are more humans on the planet than ever and you can find an exponential graph for population growth going back thousands of years, less some disturbances from major plagues.  We're past the tipping point. The last 5 years, no where near exponential population growth in the world, with negative growth rates in some industrial countries.
Point is, you can't be so sure that technology growth is going to explode despite what ever advances we have in cell phones and computer processors.  Even gravity doesn't accelerate objects to infinity before reaching a terminal velocity.

Stop pretending that a sentient species will act in such a non-sentient fashion.  Society may not now be sentient and that is why we have and might in the future act so unconsciously.  But why would the prerogative be to ignore the societal sentient imperative for the sake of seeing how smart a stupid machine could become?  We are not driven to invent. We are driven to connect.

He does not seem to be aware of or believe that suffering is inherent in all conscious existence, a teaching known as the First Noble Truth at the heart of early Buddhism.

4373074,3,B004GHNG6I,"I, now at 26 years of age, have read Kurzweil's work more than once. In many instances it was motivated by my own mad dash into another dimension in attempt to escape the realities that plague my own life, hiding between stardust particles within the Cosmos and hoping in time that all would be well in it's own time. According to the bare bones study of metaphysics, as long as I could envision it, believe it, and for all intents and purposes create it, then it was mine for the taking.

It is not a secrete that within this docurama (to call this a documentary is a stretch), there is an err (pun intended) of the notion that we will become as God. In several instances we see other brilliant minds shuddering at the idea of the evolution on the automaton as we choose to sally forth in this journey to create virtual existence. In essence, you are all like I have been: in a desperate attempt to escape the absolute fact of the matter: we cannot recreate what we do not ultimately understand. There is not a shadow of doubt that Kurzweil is perhaps the most innovative quiet voices behind the scenes (be honest, how many of you had actually heard of the man behind Kurzweil pianos?), but in moral standing we have not figured out what Truth is. And if we have not even come that far? Then we are dabbling into something that we need to pull back from and truly contemplate beofre galloping forth, with heady rush that we will Arrive.

I gave this three stars, because it deserves just that. It was very interesting and at times horrifying. My friends, we have almost succeeded in bioengineering  the first of these automatons. Real cadaver blood (that could have gone to the blood bank, but I digress...) coursing through an alarmingly close-to-nature circulatory system. This is happening faster than you think. Do yourself a favor: after watching this, develop a position on this subject. If you do not, you run the risk of letting something happen that you did not wish for.

If Kurzweil's father's spirit is in a heaven, then all that can be recreated is the idea of his father. And in that, it may push this genius into insanity from brute disappointment.",1390089600,,2164,4.569587628865979

The whole thing about wanting immortality, I mean. Life is about growth and exploration. When people get old these processes stop and life becomes meaningless so what would be the point? That's why nature ""invented"" procreation. Even the universe itself is mortal. Some things we just have to accept.

4373090,5,B004GHNG6I,"The kind of world Kurzweil envisions is, to me, inevitable.  I don't think the contents of what he describes are particularly unique to him - many futurists play around with similar components of future worlds in weaving their visions.  What is staggering about his claims though, is the timing for the these developments, in particular the claim that the ""singularity"" will occur in a timeframe that is within the bounds of most of our lifetimes.

But, what makes Kurzweil impossible (or at least silly) to ignore is what he's done on the court, so to speak.  He has been a successful inventor, in large part by predicting the timing of new technology and designing systems in advance of such developments, so that he's prepared to take advantage of them sooner than others.  He's gotten rich in the process, and as a side-effect has actually made several accurate predictions about the timing of new developments in technology many years in advance.

This documentary does an excellent job of contrasting this with Kurzweil's early loss of his father.  The film depicts a brilliant man longing for the return of an absentee father, and leaves open to the viewer the question of the impact of such a life event on the perspective of a visionary.

Since pre-history humanity has had to accept that with life comes death. Kurzweil dreams of a world where the natural cycle is hacked by technology and death overcome. The problem, as someone like Joseph Campbell might put it, is that in breaking the natural cycle of life and death, we murder our species, that we break our connection to nature and life as it has evolved over billions of years. There are other problems with Kurzweil's dream, such as where are we going to put all the people? And in a world where the old live more or less forever, can there be any room for the young?

All that said, the movie is well made and fascinating; and Kurzweil is probably more accurate in his predictions than his critics are willing to see or admit.  Something like ""the technological singularity"" is going to become reality. Like it or not. An alternative to Kurzweil's rather emotionally dysfunctional vision is needed. A vision that does a better job of harmonizing our cybernetic future to the natural world.

Nevertheless, I watched this again part to be entertained and part as just incredulousness and a need to be aware of Kurzweil's dangerous ideas. For Kurzweil, it is ok to live in virtual reality and to allow the human body to be reconstructed by biotech and genetic engineering which amounts to a Frankenstein model. Who would allow themselves to be genetically engineered to insert a flash drive into their head? More importantly, his popularity and constant talk show circuits with government and business leaders is disturbing. Prior to Kurzweil's alarming biotech immortality visions, there have been others since the 60s advocating turning humans into cybernetic or engineered monsters, able to swim like fish or endure the vacuum of space. Thankfully nothing like that has been made mainstream, but the real Kurzweil vision could be turned by governments to enslaving people with electronic biotech devices, like implanting identity chips which has been done as shown in this film , and actually tried out by corporations. Unfortunately despite his great innovations and genius in solid technical invention, Kurzweil's speculations for me will forever brand his name as Kurzweil=crackpot.",1374451200,,1570,5.434426229508197

4373108,4,B004GHNG6I,"I'm somewhat familiar with the work of futurist Ray Kurzweil having read and reviewed his book The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence (1999). He has since written several other books. He's won a lot of prizes and several honorary doctorates. He's a brilliant and original man.

As this documentary film makes clear, he is also a man afraid of dying and a man who very much misses his father and dreams of somehow bringing his father back to ""life."" Yes, quotation marks around ""life."" Kurzweil thinks that it will someday be possible to down load our brains onto some kind of software and in such form we will live forever.

I probably should read some more Kurzweil because I am sure he has an answer to my main critique of this fantastic idea, which can be illustrated by this consideration:

Suppose your brain is downloaded. Which of you is you? The one in the software whose experiences are virtual or the one in the flesh and blood whose experiences are very human-like with all the ups and downs? The lives that can be downloaded onto software will be interesting, incredible really, but only to other people.

Another thing to ask when thinking about this is ""How do you program a computer to feel pain? Or joy for that matter. Human beings are evolved beings that are subject to pleasure and pain. Software and AI machines not only don't feel any pain, they couldn't even if they wanted to. They can be programmed to act as though they feel pain but that is all. It is not even clear how animals came to develop the pleasure/pain reward/punishment system. What came first the mechanism to deliver pain or the ability to recognize the experience as pain? Nobody knows.

I wonder if Kurzweil realizes that death is part of life. Without death biological creatures such as us would experience an unbearable stasis and would of course die anyway eventually through accident, suicide, nearby supernova, etc. And as machines without biological urgings we would have no reason to go on living unless the urge is programmed into us by biological creatures. Machines don't care whether they are ""alive"" or dead. They are not afraid of the plug being pulled.

Naturally he has his critics other than me. And in this film director Robert Barry Ptolemy introduces a few and lets them have their say. The give and take is interesting. But what I think most people who are familiar with Kurzweil's work will find interesting is the portrait of the very human man himself.

The film begins with Kurzweil's appearance on TV's ""I've Got a Secret"" when he was 17-years-old and ends with his latest invention, a device that reads text aloud for the blind, and his ideas for new inventions using nanobots. In between we learn of his open heart surgery and his overriding idea that the singularity is near and that we will be able to comprehend the world of the singularity only if we are augmented with artificial intelligence. In other words we will become cyborgs, part biological creatures and part machine.

In this last prediction I think Kurzweil is right. We will meld with our machines--that is, if we don't send ourselves back to the Stone Age first.

Kurzweil gets the last say. He asks ""Does God exist?"" His very clever answer: ""I would say not yet.""

4373115,1,B004GHNG6I,"I read Kurzweil's book (""The Singularity Is Near"") and it was full of interesting ideas seemingly backed up with page after page of factoids.  The problem with this guy is his tendency to paint these unrealistic images of the future using a very broad brush.  In many ways, Kurzweil reminds me of the great Arthur C. Clarke.

In the final edition (1967) of his book ""Profiles of the Future"", Clarke presented his ""Chart Of The Future"" showing his expectations for various technological developments. Although the chart wasn't intended to be taken too seriously, it's a good illustration of how even the best thinkers can be completely wrong, here's a sample:

1980 -- efficient electrical storge, Cetacean languages (i.e., talking directly to dolphins).
1990 -- exobiology cyborgs
2000 -- fusion power, artificial intelligence, colonizing other planets
2030 -- space mining

As it turned out we aren't even close to doing ANY of these things. There's essentially no viable space program, fusion power is looking better but still decades away from practicality and we have nothing even remotely like true AI.  On the other hand, look at all the fantastic things that Clarke missed entirely or never thought of:

-- Personal computers
-- Mobil computing / integrated communication devices, cell phones, Skype, etc.
-- Mapping the human genome
-- Virtually every development in microbiology from the past 40 years.
-- Virtually every development in genetics from the past 40 years.
-- Virtually every major development in the energy industry from the past 40 years.
-- The Internet / world-wide-web, etc.
-- On-line shopping
-- Social media, blogs, personal publishing, the death of bookstores & hard-copy print, etc.
-- A Global Positioning System integrated into commercial applications (not just military)
-- High-res global imaging available to anyone with Internet access.

Clarke was pretty smart in his day and the go-to-guy on all things technological, especially in the field computers and space exploration. Yet, despite his knowledge and foresight, Mr. Clarke couldn't come close to predicting the future we now inhabit.  So why should we all worship the well-intentioned-but-misguided blatherings of Mr. Kurzweil?

Kurzweil, like Clarke, failed to understand that just because a thing CAN be done, it doesn't necessarily follow that it WILL be done.  For example:  I spent a great deal of time studying the area of nano-technology and can tell you there are very few experts currently working in the field who are willing to go on record in claiming that blood-cell-sized nanobots were even feasible let along something we'll see within the next 30-40 yrs; a more-likely development is the use of engineered proteins.  Once again, like Clarke, Kurzweil is caught wearing technological blinders which force him to focus on one specific technology as the magic bullet that will cure all of our ills.

Finally: Kurzweil is obsessed with this idea of exponential technological development -- the concept is absolute rubbish!  Technology develops in fits and starts; it's moderated largely by economics and other factors. Technology develops in layers, often times with older tech merging / mixing / integrating with newer tech.  But the one thing seldom considered is what drives technological development in the first place? Prior to the 1970's it was the military, since then its been the demand-driven consumer economy.  Our technology is developing at a far more rapid pace these days because of the growth of the global economy, i.e. the power of free-market capitalism on a global scale!

The computer I'm using right now is functionally far-superior to the one I had ten years ago; more importantly, I'm getting all this new functionality at about one fourth of the price I paid for the old machine.  Yeah, component density has gone way up, the batteries are better, better storage technology, etc.  But, fundamentally, the basic design and operation is still the same; we still have CPU's, memory, a keyboard, a mouse and a viewing screen.

True, the old Gateway was slower and clunky, but the new MacBook is still technologically the same device, just improved but not radically different.  I saw a radical IMPROVEMENT in technology but not an exponential CHANGE in technology -- a computer is still a computer.

That we will live longer because we will implant all kinds of technology into our bodies that will eventually make us so 'god like' that we will be as Gods. It's a very intriguing video even though he dismisses his creator. He shows a interesting history of how far we have come and gives quite a description of what things will be like in the future.

4373152,2,B004GHNG6I,"There is already a textbook refutation to the line of thinking proposed here. Did the makers of the Transcendant Man just decide to ignore that?

The refutation to the computational theory of the mind is pretty basic:

Computer programs (as defined by Alan Turing) are based on purely formal symbol manipulation (Syntax)
Minds have meaning, consciousness, intentionality (semantics)
Syntax by itself is not sufficient for or constitutive of semantics (As demonstrated by the Chinese Room and Lowenhiem-Skolem Theorems of Model Theory)
Thus, computer programs are not minds

If the mind is not a digital computer then there are seriously mistaken claims made in the documentary. For one, the Singularity could not happen because given even the most powerful computer program (whether that happens in 25 years or 25,000 years), it will have no way of getting from the pure formal symbol manipulation to the semantics of consciousness. Moreover, there will not be a point in time where one could upload the mind onto a computer because it isn't a computer program.

The other, and perhaps more fundamental refutation of Kurzweil's line of thinking is this: Computation is observer-relative. It only exists relative to our interpretation. In other words you can't ""discover"" the mind is a computer program in the manner which we've come to discover natural physical phenomenon like plate tectonics. Instead, we assign computational interpretations to various phenomena for our own purposes. For example, we literally calculate with a calculator even though all the calculator is actually doing is going through a series of otherwise meaningless electrical state transitions. So in the scene at the end where Kurzweil is looking at the ocean, we are meant to suppose that he is discovering the computational nature of the waves when in fact he is assigning a (rather arbitrary) computational interpretation to them. Anything can be interpreted computationally and it is not that big of a deal, at least if our goal is to understand how the brain biologically produces consciousness.

The complaint is not that the film makes these errors per se, but that it doesn't even acknowledge the common sense and well known refutations of its central premise. Do Kurzweil and the like really not know Searle's Chinese Room or even other competing intellectual conceptions of the mind? I find that hard to believe. Instead, we are left with a trichotomy. If your average joe disagrees with Kurzweil, the only dissenting opinions are that he ignores biology (this ""argument"" was used briefly as a vague one-liner), or the view point by the man at the end that he has a spirit. If God exists and we do have spirits that's cool.  Regardless, we need only to make a couple really basic distinctions to see Transcendant Man misses the mark.

Edit:
I just checked online and in fact there is a Kurzweil-Searle debate provided by the NYer. Some of it is behind a pay-wall but a lot of it is free. Definitely worth checking out.",1360195200,5,3005,5.058585858585858
4373153,3,B004GHNG6I,"Kurzweil is one of those wannabe prophets of technology that, in their own deluded way, sickly mirror religious prophets in their doom and/or wonder. In Kurzweil's case, his vision of tomorrow is all wonder, but a wonder based on information with no ability to process it. In short, Kurzweil is glaringly void of wisdom (after all, sans trials, intellect cannot advance). He bases this on what he claims (as well his acolytes) to be his near flawless prediction history. Being naturally wary of such claims, it took a less than 60 second Google search to find out that Kurzweil's predictive abilities were far less than perfect, and often so nebulous that one wonders if he secretly made much of his fortune as a carnival seer. Yes, he does solidly in technological predictions, but rather abysmally on softer predictions involving society ad things human centered.
  Yes, Kurzweil has invented many useful gadgets, but none of this qualifies him to speak with any authority on any subjects outside his narrow purview. However, Kurzweil is a multimillionaire, which in America means he is a `genius' of the highest order, even if his mind is almost painfully Functionary as it flails about in its own idees fixe. In one of the film's grand moments of irony, the hypochondriacal Kurzweil discourses about how he once had diabetes, and, through a regimen of taking over 200 pills a day, he has successfully `reprogrammed' his body into being a lean and healthy machine. Then we hear that the man suffered a heart attack, due to a faulty heart valve, during filming. Does this chasten the man? No. In fact, we get an even deeper delve into what can only be fairly described as the man's obsessive compulsion for his life's work- and that is cybernetically somehow resurrecting his father, who died when Kurzweil was young. Now, one might think such a revelation would add a patina of pathos to the film. It does not, for Kurzweil is just so stupid in his pursuit (as example, to get the most accurate simulacrum of daddy he has saved decades old receipts and financial notations from his father, as if these will, when worked into some magical future algorithm, have any bearing on making as HAL 9000 of his old man). Lunacy unfettered. Instead of praise for Kurzweil, the film actually engenders pity for his delusive pursuit.
  Balancing out the man's all too rosy optimism is a panel of gloomy counterparts who revel in their own sci fi fantasies and clichs of the bleak cyberpunk future that awaits us, replete with Terminators, human bondage, cyborgs, ultimate wars between AI true believers and fanatical Luddites, etc. It's all quite laughable, for predictions of the future almost always get some things right and most wrong. As example, in the 1960s of my youth, the 21st Century was to be a Jetsons-like propelled time of flying cars with no idea of the Internet. What these wannabe Nostradami miss is that, in twenty or ten thousand years, people will still be people (bitching of taxes or bad bosses or life's general futility), cybernetically enhanced or not, and technology has always served human needs, and adapted to them, not supplanted them, nor made us adapt to them. Like the two prior films, this one features stellar technical work by cinematographer Shawn Dufraine and editor Meg Decker, as well as one of the better film scores of his hit and miss career by Philip Glass.
  Naturally, Kurzweil's claim to fame rests on his idea of The Singularity- the time wherein humans and machines merge, thus allowing immortality to be achieved. Kurzweil claims this will occur before mid-century. One of the few non-extremist talking heads- a medical doctor, William B. Hurlbut, finds the claim absurd, given how little we currently know of the human genome, body, and, especially, the brain. Other than Kurzweil, the oddest of the talking heads is AI researcher Hugo de Garis. This man is so condescending in his views (which are of the gloomy sort) that, while warning of his future hell of billion slaughtered, in what he calls the impeding Artilect War, actually feels he needs to explain that Artilect is a portmanteau of the words artificial and intellect.
  At the center of all these would be pundits' predictions is a reality that they assiduously think that, by not mentioning, will be avoided, and that is The Law Of Unintended Consequences. A minor example: the rise of digital information, in the 1980s, was hailed with the claim of being a green technology that would virtually eliminate paper copies of information, thereby saving reckless deforestation. Instead, the near ubiquity of personal computers has seen a mind-boggling increase in paper production and consumption for information, as private citizens and business print up emails and documents as backups for the digital information. More paper is consumed than ever before.
  Nonetheless, Kurzweil is an oddly fascinating subject for a film- the ever scared little man wasting his brief time alive on chimeras that are best left for a later time, even if not for the adulatory reasons director Ptolemy intones in virtually every scene of Transcendent Man, for, far from being transcendent, Kurzweil comes off as an emotionally arrested naf, tilting at a Quixotic future he is wholly unprepared to wean himself from.",1359676800,2,5302,4.967305524239008

4373157,1,B004GHNG6I,"All the ideas and prophetic predictions made in this film are based on a few premises.  While Mr. Kurzweil appears to be an accomplished engineer, who is ingeneous and hard-working, and did well for himself for the last three dacades or so, I must say that I am very shocked by his simplicity in his fundamentally flawed reasoning.  Firstly, his premise is that knowledge, data, and intelligence will enable the humanity to solve ""all"" its problems, including all illnesses, diseases, and even death.  The second premise is that due to the exponential growth of our ability to ""reason""/ ""calculate""/ ""compute"" and ""process information,"" it will allow us to tackle and deal with any and all problems that we face as individuals and as a collective species.  Basically, he is preaching that technology will solve everything.  That's a very hopeful/wishful thinking.  His premises are fundamentally flawed.  He is making a prediction of human development and history based on a narrow analysis of how information technology and science have developed during the last century.  This shows that Mr. Kurzweil is neither a well-trained scientist, nor a well-versed history.  Mr. Kurzweil is, as he is known, just an inventor.  He is an inventor of many things, and now, Mr. Kurzweil is downright inventing a futuristic fiction.  The film reiterates the fact that how technology has progressed during the last century and how it has changed our lives for the better.  This shows Mr. Kurzweil's blindness and utter disconnection from the reality.  He is not reading real facts and real data about the condition of our earth, our environment, our health statistics.  In this film, Mr. Kurzweil repeats this wishful thinking that once we invent this new thing, whether it be AI, nano-robots, or new nano-computer, we will figure out a way to salvage our planet and our human existance.  But, hard data/ real data say something quite different.  Firstly, Mr. Kurzweil hardly takes into the account the fact that there might be physical/molecular limitations to what we can do with our body and with the nature.  He seems to believe that as we gain more knowledge about our world, that will directly translate into our ability to manipulate the nature and weild it in any way we want it.  Not so.  The history has shown that time and time again that even with our technology advancement, our ability to manipulate and wield the nature has its limits.  There are things that can not be done fundamentally due to the natural laws that are in place.  Also, the history shows that when we try to manipulate and weild the nature, we always fail to take into the account all the collateral conseqeunces.  What are the collateral consequences?  I highly recommand watching a documentary ""GasLand"" or ""Food, Inc.""  In this film, Mr. Kurzweil seems to be a big proponent of ""nano-technology"" and ""information processing nano computers.""  He seems to be completely certain that these new technologies will allow things to move in the right direction, and for the better.  Now, let's look at where our old ""new technologies"" brought us.  When we first had our detergents, we thought those were good things.  When we had first coal based power plants, we thought those will improve our lives.  McDonalds, auto-mobiles, nuclear plants, GNO's, detergents, chemicals, plastics, etc, etc, etc.  These are the men-made inventions that were at one point looked up to as improving our lives for better.  And, computers.  But, who will actually say that our lives are ""so-much better"" because of these things.  They are things of convenience.  Things that allow us to have more down time, to enjoy our lives.  Essentially, our humanity had lived hundreds years, if not thousands, without these novelties, and they were able to create and achieve many things.  Somehow, Mr. Kurzweil is suggesting that ""inventions"" are making things for the better.  Not necessarily, and not realistically.  Things have allowed us to have more free time and have more things to eat, and less chance of getting ill.  Those three potent combinations only resulted in increased obesity, increased mortality, and increased social problems.  Mr. Kurzweil's idea of nano-computers and nano-bodies are potentially very dangerous.  And throughout this movie, it was not once mentioned what kind of biological and environmental havoc these things can create, if these ""nano"" technology get out of the control.  These things can alter and terminate natural biological cycles, and these could ultimately detroy all bio-organisms.  Look at how much more cancer patients we have these days.  These are due to our increased use of chemicals and new materials.  Yes, plastics and kevlars are helpful, but on the other hand, those things do negatively impact our environment and they are disrupting the nature's biological cycles.  The same thing can be said about many other inventions.  Mr. Kurzweil does not seem to take any of these negative effects into the consideration.  What's even more troubling is that Mr. Kurzweil, at one point in the film, states that ""human beings could be reduced to data, since in fact, we are nothing more than biological existance with innumerable encoded data, such as DNA's and neurological impulses.""  This means Mr. Kurzweil's understanding of ""humanity"" is not only atheistic, but also completely ""de-humanizing.""  Mr. Kurzweil suggests that we are just collection of data, so if those data (memories, emotions, and ideas) can be stored, we could become immortal.  The idea might be very ""sci-fi"", but that's not scientific, and that certainly is not historical.  Mr. Kurzweil is reducing the significance of humanity, what makes us human beings, fundamentally different from other animals, into just free floating information.  Even from an atheistic point of view, this must be a very troubling idea.  Mr. Kurzweil envisions that our future is going to be ""Matrix (the movie)""-like existance.  We will exist virtually as a figment of ideas, as data, as information.  And, the most troubling thing is that Mr. Kurzweil appears to think that this is not only ok, but also inevitable and should be a great thing for the humanity, because it will make us ""immortal.""  Personally, that's the saddest view on human existance and the humanity's future I've ever heard of.  Mr. Kurzweil basically envisions our future to be like the movie ""Matrix"" and ""Terminator.""  He wants humans to become ""battery cells"" or ""slaves of super intelligent computers.""  To me, Mr. Kurzweil is a mad inventor, like Dr. Moreau, who is obsessed with the idea of changing human existance by new inventions.  I would not call him a scientist.  If he is a real scientist, he would know the bounds and limits of the natural laws.  It is very troubling that so many people are attending his conferences and talks, and that so many people feed into Mr. Kurzweil's vision of our humanity's future.  His vision is a doomsday scenario that is waiting to happen.  Look no further.  We already have our problems handful: environmental degradation, carbon-based economy, industrialized food production, increasing rate of human population, global warming, shortage of food, disappearing bees, etc.  These are the collateral, latent, un-foreseen consequences of our inventions.  Mr. Kurzweil appears to think that there would be no adverse, collateral consequences to the inventions that he is suggesting.  Mr. Kurzweil is a mad inventor, with a very flawed and narrow view.  Just because he invented something to aid people with hearing problem, don't think that he will save the humanity from all its problems.",1357948800,8,7648,5.121970920840065

I find everything he's done and says, to be extremely fascinating, and while I'm not offended by any means of his future visions, I just cannot bare myself to agree to them. They make a wonderfully stated point of how our human evolution has been conserved for the past X thousands of years, yet I also believe death to be a part of our conserved evolution. One way I can analogize this is, some trees can live up to hundreds, even thousands of years, which is a property that evolution has preserved for that species; I don't feel that this is a property that human life should conserve.

4373159,3,B004GHNG6I,"Documentaries are always informative, but often ""tell the tale"" of a filmmaker's prejudices rather than the facts of his or her subject. According to this movie, Kurzweil made his name and his fortune by inventing the optical scanner, but he began spinning his genius off into another direction when it became clear to him that by the year 2029 we will all be digital--'bots will keep us healthy, moderate our brain function, restrain our emotions, and we souls in this reality must evolve and prepare ourselves for this future. I wish the film had stuck to this premise because I wanted to know more. Instead, it focused on Kurzweil's early life with indulgent parents who divorced, and a father who wasn't around much.

Interesting to contemplate, yes, but by the end of the film, Kurzweil looks like a philosopher who hasn't really sorted out his ideas, or like a highly successful inventor who re-invents himself and fails to find his stride. So, while the film is interesting and enlightening, it is a movie that starts with a good idea that fails to develop fully within the story that's being told.",1355702400,4,1105,4.815789473684211

4373166,5,B004GHNG6I,"One part biography, one part brain food; as an appetizer to the thought path of noted futurist Ray Kurzweil, it can be difficult at times to separate fact from fragment over the course of this documentary. Kurzweil's favorite subject is one of increasing relevance, perhaps even by the minute: he seeks to pinpoint the moment of so-called ""singularity,"" when mankind's built-in body chemistry will finally cross the line into his rapidly-developing technological and biological know-how. In short - how soon will we be able to back up our thoughts and feelings to an external hard drive, what sort of moral and philosophical arguments will be made for and against the practice, and where will the ball of wax roll after that debate is behind us? Though its post-production effects can get a bit over-the-top at times, reminding viewers more than once of the over-ambitious ""world of tomorrow"" predictions popular in the 1950s, the film is largely successful at fostering a curious sort of fascination with the current point in history and the staggering number of possibilities present within our lifetime. Kurzweil himself is to thank for much of that, as his smooth, relaxed speaking gives the impression that anything is possible, even if (as some of his detractors point out during the film's apex) he completely overlooks humanity's tendency to use such moments for evil causes as well as good.

4373169,5,B004GHNG6I,"Earlier ('99) Kurzweil argued that the ever-accelerating rate of technological change would lead to computers rivaling the full range of human intelligence.  Now he considers the union of human brains with the vastly greater capacity and speed of computers.  That merging is the Singularity where there will be no clear distinction between human and machine, real and virtual reality - and occur around 2045.  Human aging and illness will be reversed, pollution stopped, and world hunger and poverty solved.

Kurzweil goes on to point out that the brain has massive parallelism (100 trillion interneuronal connections operating simultaneously to quickly  realize subtle patterns, but involving transactions several million times slower than current electronic circuits.  The result is an increasing mismatch vs. the exponential growth of our knowledge base.

Kurzweil then steps back to gain perspective on the accelerating rate of progress.  The 20th century's achievements represent about 20 years of progress at the rate accomplished in the year 2000; he projects that the next 20 years' of progress will be accomplished in about 14, followed by the next in only 7.  Thus, the 21st century will bring progress of about 1,000 times that of the 20th century.  We tend to overestimate what can be achieved in the short term (due to leaving out details), and underestimate the long term possibilities (assuming the future will simply represent a linear extrapolation of recent years, rather than what has recently become exponential growth).

Kurzweil sees effective software models of human intelligence by the mid-2020s.  This will allow ""intelligence"" to be applied to the billions of facts machines can precisely and instantly recalled.  Another benefit is that once a skill is mastered using artificial means it can be performed accurately and repeatedly at high speed, and shared at extremely high speed.  Thus, machines designing machines, aiding every-day decision-making and analysis of technological problems will result in incredible improvements in our ability to utilize artificial organs, digestion, blood, etc.

Clearly Kurzweil's basic premise - the rate of technological progress has become exponential - is a fascinating, well-documented, and uplifting one.  However, I am a bit more reserved about the future situation regarding resources such as water, energy, and living space, as well as how an economy would function when there is very little work left for humans.  I'm also left wondering what will happen with the current disputes among social classes, religions, nations etc. that so permeate today.

Nonetheless, ""Transcendent Man"" is a very thought-provoking and must-see DVD.",1316649600,6,2703,5.519417475728155

4373171,5,B004GHNG6I,"The frantic, juvenile search ""without"" oneself for the strength one lacks ""within"" is as eternal and laughable as death.

There have been eons of prophets professing the acceleration then the end of the world on their terms and oh the ever more fantastic ways in which we must flock like limping urban pigeons to the beta programs of GMO seeds that their companies, religions, dogmas, whatever hand out like hippies did with acid for the mass immortality/enlightenment of, well, just them.

Yet the prophets' own struggle towards this singularity point serves only to illuminate the black hole of their personas and ultimate inability to overcome internal ridicule (which are nothing more than internalized school yard bullies).

The culmination of a life of material aquisition rather than the truing of one's perspectives clarifies the actual underlying fear of their own natural selection and lack of progeny having already screwed themselves sterile by secretly, impatiently attempting masturbation with their 1st Gen cyborg arms. Yet how they promise the second Gen arms won't accidentally rip anything off.

And so evolutionary processes end omnipotence with impotence.

Another mathematical model encompassing exponential growth and ecology is the logistic curve.

The only effective antidote to the mutually assured aneurysm that singularity would be is, and always has been a coincident oral tradition that possesses an ever more pertinent contribution to try to lower our collective blood pressure. Luckily for the rest of us, all of our lessons of history are preserved whether or not the 2 year life span of our hard drives can remember them after another 2000.  The only things that can lengthen our exponentially declining attention spans are the quiet, whispering, patient discussions that root themselves around dinner tables and round tables alike - an ever enduring, wholesomely democratic, even artistic process that lies squarely in the middle of all these tirades and like it or not actually and inexorably ties us together: compromise. But how unremarkable it is to the prophet's culture to be inconvenienced, even slightly, yet how greedily consumed in pill form this organic fruit from the tallest and most disparate branches of human intellect that compromise represents - a tree that even the most ambitious prophet's fruit will never fall far from.

To choke on oneself's, one's father's mortality as too tough a pill to swallow without the chaser that is the aqueous nature of our beings - which can at a moments notice like big shiny soap bubbles containing all our precious memories tragically pop when touched by the fickle finger of fate - is the seed of almost all hubris in literature.

That Cyborgs will undoubtedly have Achilles' heels,  is the inherent disproof of the very notion that transcendent singularity can even happen.  Whatever the dreams shared for the future - all the while our feet get weaker just sitting in front of the computer all day.  So much of our bodies (and probably genetics?) are ""use it or loose it.""  And how! The Romans too got fat, over sexed, and poisoned with heavy metals.  But after the brief boiling over, even they survived.  Life just goes on, regardless of the level of quality and balance we choose in our time.

Its ironic still, how the few remaining classics after the burning of Alexandria yield so much perspective into the inhumane nature of those foolhardy enough to try to improve our entire species by first attempting to tip the equation in their favor.

And so the natural history of the world repeats itself generation after the next to trip these fools given enough rope of their own DNA.",1312502400,2,3677,5.091514143094842

His insights about the future, based on what he's learned about the speed of change, are remarkable. But the DVD doesn't capture that well at all. Instead of making his points, providing evidence and refuting key objections that people have raised over the years--which is what he did at the presentation--this video focuses on a few soundbites about his ideas, doesn't illustrate them, and doesn't show you the objections that commonly get raised and his answers to those objections. Instead, it spends a lot of time on irrelevant side trips, such as showing him talking about his father and how he'd love to ""recreate"" his father via computer technology; and it shows people giving their opinions about his ideas without giving him a chance to respond. Despite the awards this video has apparently won, it is a LOUSY representation of Kurzweil's ideas and his defense of them. Don't waste your time and money. Instead, try to see him talk live.

His singular focus on the human missus the development of other forms of matter and the interconnectedness of it all.  We did not develop in isolation and we cannot sigularly develop ourselves in isolation. The evolution of matter organizing has no preference for a particular form. Ray has also boxed himself into a belief system that sadly chooses to focus on the dying light.

Those already familiar with Kurzweil's ideas and predictions, as I was, will find little new material here, but others will come away well informed.

For myself, and perhaps others already relatively knowledgeable about Kurzweil's work, the most striking aspects of the doc were the too-infrequent glimpses into Kurzweil's psyche.  I found this both enlightening and problematic, as Kurzweil is a difficult man to relate to emotionally.  He seems constantly lost in the future, as one might expect from a futurist, but to an extreme degree, and at the expense of living in the flesh-and-blood present.  He lives in a large and spectacularly beautiful house situated amidst lush greenery in Queens, New York, filled with countless awards and objects of interest, but displays only a passing interest in all of this abundance made possible by his achievements.  He says he enjoys gardening - even a single shot of him doing that would have helped pull him back to earth.

All of Kurzweil's energies seem devoted to imagining and planning for the day in which he becomes an immortal bionic consciousness without an organic body.  That, and resurrecting his long-dead father via a digital avatar created from the numerous records of his father's life he has preserved and memories pulled from his own brain.  This last humanizes him in an odd way, as his love for his father comes through, but at the same time does little to assuage the worries of viewers like me for his emotional stability and even sanity.
