7972070,3,B00006LPGG,"I watched only cause of Yueh Hua and Chang Yi. There are neither Ninjas or Wolves in this movie.  Typical evil eunuch trying to run shady activities from the emperor type ""plot"", a side love story that was never fleshed out, double agents, rise of power, ethnocentrism. Honestly, i have no desire to write anything else about this rather mediocre movie. There really isn't anything memorable about this movie other than Yueh Hua's bad wigs and eyebrows.",1510358400,,453,4.883116883116883
7972071,5,B00006LPGG,not in original mandarin audio but still excellent!,1495929600,,51,5.5
7972072,3,B00006LPGG,"Horrendous VHS transfer to DVD. Has watermarks that appear throughout the movie. At at least one point a copyright 1985 warning comes up in the center of the screen. Has video \picture distortion on the bottom of the screen and crappy audio. No extras. The disk should be in the $1.00 bin. The description says widescreen , it's not, it's 4:3. I like the movie, hence the 3 stars, but the transfer gets zero.  For diehard fans only. Here is to hoping that this movie gets a decent transfer from a print in the future, but I would not hold my breath.",1425340800,2,549,4.382352941176471
7972073,3,B00006LPGG,Chang Yi plays a corrupt eunuch general who uses his personal body guards as a hit squad to anyone who apposes his views.  Yueh Hua and Chen Mu Chung are 2 japanese swordsmen who join the general's body guards and quickly rise up and cause deception in the ranks. This isn't one of my favorite movies but it is action packed and has a little surprise at the end.,1418860800,,362,4.246376811594203
7972074,3,B00006LPGG,"Product review: In reference to the Bonzi, Red Sun, PanMedia, Shaolin Collection or whatever it is DVD: NO! IT'S NOT WIDESCREEN! It's a VHS transfer from Ocean Shores in full screen and English dubbed. The picture is that of a VHS quality with a blurry line on the bottom of the screen throughout the movie. However I was satisfied enough with the product because it's a hard movie to acquire, the full-screen ratio doesn't ruin the fight scenes and it's not one of those lousy stinking German versions where they cut practically all the violence from the movie. So there.

The movie itself is great and is the last movie Jimmy Wang Yu directed before his career petered out into obscurity. The unfortunate thing about this whole endeavor is that, yes, I've seen Kung Pow: Enter The Fist and I just couldn't help myself quoting those Kung Pow lines to certain parts and it just ruins my whole experience with Savage Killers. DAMN YOU STEVE OEDEKERK!! I CAN'T PRONOUNS YOUR ****ING LAST NAME!!

In conclusion: I would dismember my arms for a legitimate Widescreen release for this movie and THESE PEOPLE KNOW WHERE THEY FIND IT!! OEDEKERK, PEOPLES!!! HELLO!! Anyways, 5 stars for the movie and 2 3/4 stars for the product.",1413590400,2,1221,4.754716981132075
7972075,5,B00006LPGG,"When I saw Steve Oederick's Kung Pow, I was curious as to what movie this was and after I found it, I watched it just the fun out of it. In the end, it was quite worth it!

I honestly thought the plot, acting and fighting would sum up to be ridiculous and unrealistic, but the directors honestly did a good job at it, compared to some, if not, most films from the ""Kung Fu Fighting"" years of the 70s. The fighting in the film also is really done well, especially the fact that Jimmy Wang Yu stars in this film and is pretty realistic (no flying, breaking walls with one punches or fists flying a hundred miles per hour). The english dubbing isn't all that bad either.

All I can say is if you're a Kung Pow fan like me, or a fan of martial arts films, then this should be something you should watch! You won't regret it!",1397347200,5,820,4.11875
7972076,3,B00006LPGG,"Fun for exactly 15 minutes.
Wheooowheeooow wheeeowwwweeeeee.
That's a lot of nuts!

7972077,5,B00006LPGG,A good old school kungfu movie that would be great for martial arts collectors. very entertaining with plenty of action.....,1347494400,,124,5.25
7972078,4,B00006LPGG,The main star in this movie is Chang Yi who always plays the villian well he's only in one fight scene which is the ending. Yue Hua a large Shaw Brothers star is the lead and he does well not a 5 star fight movie more a 3 star.,1282694400,,227,3.6530612244897958
