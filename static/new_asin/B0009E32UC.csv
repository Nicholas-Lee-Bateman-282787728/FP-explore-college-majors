2281621,3,B0009E32UC,"Although it takes place between the stories of the original 1979 Mobile Suit Gundam TV series and the first sequel, 1985's Zeta Gundam TV series, Gundam 0083 was created in the early '90s, which complicates story matters somewhat, particularly for the hard core Gundam fan who works hard to rationalize the minutae of this fictional universe.

But for everyone else, this is a great action show, most episodes having at least one decent-length combat sequence, and some having multiple.  The action is top-notch; not quite as flashy as can be found now, fifteen years after it Gundam 0083 began, but even so there is enough highly-detailed action to please nearly anyone.

The rest of the story, however, is more than a little cliche, even for anime.  The protagonist, Kou Uraki, is only marginally better at combat than he is at dealing with women, so it may seem odd that he is assigned the prototype Gundam GP-01 mobile suit rather than one of the more experienced pilots who enters the scene after the nuclear-armed Gundam GP-02A is stolen by hard-core Zeon holdouts who refuse to admit that Zeon lost the war depicted in the original Mobile Suit Gundam TV series.

The Earth Federation, meanwhile, is consistantly portrayed as small-minded, weak, and corrupt; so much so that the characters themselves wonder how the Federation managed to win the previous war. On the flip side, only the clean part of Zeon is represented in this show, despite the fact that the backstory of one of the characters presents her as a participant in Zeon's ethnic cleansing program which wiped out approximately half of the human race.  But, as I said, none of this is presented in the show, so don't worry too much about it.

Action is the centerpeice of this story, and all other considerations tend to be sacrificed in order to arrange combat between the major characters.  The action is good; the mechanical designs by industry giants Shoji Kawamori and Hajime Katoki are constantly in the spotlight, and the majority of the action scenes were lovingly detailed by the animation staff.  So, if you prefer a fast pace, lots of action, and a minimum of exposition, this is definitely a show you should consider.  If you prefer deep characters, a strong storyline, and well-considered plots, you'll probably want to look at the other Gundam OAVs, like Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket or Gundam: The 08th MS Team.",1144713600,11,2397,4.867321867321867
2281622,5,B0009E32UC,"I first saw Gundam Wing aired on CN, and thought that it was the PREMIERE Gundam series... I also thought it was the only Gundam series.  Then, I saw Tomino's original Gundam. There are no words capable of expressing his ability as a writer/ director.  Since then I have followed all the U.C. Gundam series, with that only in mind.  I have yet to see all of Zeta Gundam, or any of Formula 91, but I have seen all, and of recent, own all the short OVA series.  Stardust Memory is what I would call the rise to greatness.

2281625,5,B0009E32UC,"0083 is a must-have for Gundam fans, especially UC timeline fans. Not only 0083 features some of the best Gundam mecha designs and top notch animations by Shoji Kawamori, it is also the most epic of all the UC OVA's.

0083 is basically a story about 3 years after the One Year War when the Delaz Fleet emerges from hiding and gathers its strength and plans to steal a Gundam prototype that is armed with a nuclear warhead, the GP02A Physalis (this is one mean Gundam, see for yourself). Lt. Cdr. Anavel Gato, ""Nightmare of Solomon"", is the Zeon ace pilot in charge of the stealing mission. And the only thing that stands between the nuke-armed Gato and Earth is the Federation rookie pilot Ensign Kou Uraki.

While Kou Uraki is a test pilot with big potentials, Gato scoffs at Uraki's efforts to undermine the plans of the Delaz Fleet. Moreover, as Kou's obsession to get GP02A back grows, the rivalry between Uraki and Gato is obviously one-sided. Gato, and his veteran spacenoid pride, will never allow a rookie earthnoid spoil his path to glory.

The remnants of the Zeon forces plan to steal a new Federation Gundam armed with a nuclear warhead. The rookie pilot Kou Uraki and the battleship Albion are ordered to recover it before the Zeon can use the nuke.

This is one of my favorite Gundam series. What makes this series great is the character development. There are lots of cool characters and plenty of action.  There is also a pretty interesting love triangle going on during all the action too. There's a lot to love about this series. It's definitely one of the more satisfying Gundams.

2281740,5,B0009E32UC,IMHO One of the best in the entire UC Gundam saga.  Just wish the series was being put on Blu-ray....,1344988800,,101,4.05
2281741,4,B0009E32UC,"0083 is set in sort of a lull between the huge epic wars that make up the UC shows (it's a prequel to Zeta). Don't worry, though, as all-out action is replaced by some very compelling intrigue. A nuclear-capable mobile suit, illegally developed by Earth, is captured by Zeon loyalists, and the uneasy peace between the inner and outer colonies is threatened as the conspirators try (and succeed) to drive the war back into high gear. Conflict is plentiful, but unlike some other series in this franchise, it is made up mostly of sudden, small skirmishes that have surprisingly detailed, realistic consequences. We get into the heads not only of the good guys and the lead villain (who in good Gundam tradition is more of a misguided idealist) but even of some of the incidental pilots that the heroes must face. One memorable sequence sees the protagonist willingly help a disabled Zeon vet who takes him in repair his own mobile suit, with both of them knowing their bonding will end in one of their deaths.

Eventually all-out conflict erupts, and the storytelling goes off the rails a bit, but the final action sequences are hectic and brilliant- watching the whole show at once you get a great sense of escalating tension and violence until it errupts. And you can watch this show in one sitting, it's not even as long as Wing- although the short length allowed the team to pack in consistently smooth animation that maintains a near-theatrical quality the whole time. The soundtrack is perfect as well- outstanding 80s-90s anime theme music with great vocals and exciting guitar work to get you pumped for each episode, and tense, atmospheric music for conspirators meeting in shadow and gunfights erupting in the desert...

Overall, this series is a great bridging point between classic gundam shows and later fare, and its quality art, manageable length, and wonderful characterization make it a fantastic entry point for new fans as well.

PROS:
-Visually beautiful, with a great soundtrack
-Compelling and very human characters
-Very well thought-out action sequences
-A tight plot that seldom drags and is totally free of holes

CONS:
-The climax, while turbulent and exciting lacks the crazy one-on-one duel the series seems to build to (the ""ultimate"" mobile suit used by the Zeon forces is pretty much just a spaceship)
-In the context of the Gundam universe one mobile suit with nuclear weapons seems like a pretty tame threat (spoiler: what ""nuclear weapon"" means in the Gundamverse is a bit more extreme than what it means now)
-It's a bit of a downer to know that the good guy elite task force in this series will go on to be the jackbooted thugs in Zeta Gundam

COMMENTS:
-Disk 3 of this series gave me tons of problems. 3 different ones were lemons. Maybe that's not a problem with this set?
-Familiarity with past Gundam series is not necessary to enjoy this one, but it helps.",1342483200,,2897,4.832661290322581
2281742,4,B0009E32UC,"No sense beating around the proverbial bush on this one: I adore the Gundam franchise. I liked it immediately and made my way through 0079, Zeta, Wing, Seed and even the G-Gundams before venturing off into some of the smaller series.  Naturally I did them all out of order, but no matter, their charm endured.  I was enamored with 1989's Gundam 0080 War in the Pocket and eagerly awaited Bandai's decision to release 1990's 0083 Stardust Memory in a full ""Anime Legends"" collection here in the States.

On April 21, 2009, they did just that and I had it ordered immediately.  Yes I realize I'm a couple years late with the review but that has more to do with lack of time for getting into some rich anime than it does for lack of wanting.

Set in the year Universal Century 0083, Stardust Memory tells of what happens when Zeon Intelligence identifies a prototype Gundam designed for nuclear attack under development by Anaheim Electronics.

A former Zeon ace and a small band of Principality soldiers are dispatched to Earth to capture the Gundam as part of Operation Stardust. When the Zeon successfully make off with the prototype the Earth Federation assigns the mobile suit carrier Albion to locate and recover the missing nuclear unit.

We follow the exploits of the Albion's young crew including lead character, 19-year-old pilot Kou Uraki amd his love interest Nina Purpleton of Anaheim Electronics, as they track down the Zeons responsible for the theft.

A surprisingly great deal of character growth takes place among the span of only 13 (half-hour) episodes.  Much of this can be credited to absolutely flawless pacing despite the fact that the series is split between two different directors; Mitsuko Kase (Episodes 1-7) and Takashi Imanishi (8-13).

Using the remastered audio tracks that were created quite a few years ago both language presentations are very well done and we're given a full 5.1 mix of the Japanese track as well as a remix of the surprisingly moving English 5.1 track.

Produced back in 1990, Stardust Memory does things the old fashioned way with hand drawn/ shaded cells and it is absolutely amazing how well they hold up even today.  The modern generation used to computer generated texturing in shows like Seed/ Seed Destiny and Unicorn may be a bit disappointed by the slightly less color-popping pallet but making the transition is quite effortless and certainly worth the effort.

The attention to detail throughout is remarkable and the characters only add to the enjoyment of the tale rather than detract from it, as is so often the case with broody/ dark, overly moody personas of contemporary anime efforts.

The material is of course mecha-based but only in the absolute best sense of the term.  The character interaction, humor and rhythm are very reminiscent of Top Gun.  The robots themselves are absolutely practical; serving almost as what we would now consider fighter-jets but with the convenience of functioning appendages and interstellar flight capabilities.

Like with all Gundam entries, there is great attempted realism in the robotic design and weaponry; pilots can and do run out of fuel and ammunition and breakdowns requiring repair or reconstruction are common. The technology is practical and is either derived from true science or at the very least well-explained, feasible technology not unlike that which fans expect of Star Trek.

Of course what makes it all most interesting is that the realistic science/ physics, character development and love interests are all transpiring against the backdrop of a very realistic and feasible war setting.  There aren't good guys and bad guys here so much as there are two points of view, each valid from its own perspective.  As such characters you come to grow attached to don't always end up making it to the end and the side you can most easily relate with doesn't always come out on top.

In all, coming back to Gundam after a few years' hiatus was like coming home to a good friend.  There have been franchises that do things bigger, brighter, longer and with more hype but it is the perfect melding of character drama with realistic robots and sweeping political prose that keeps Gundam so popular even still in its third decade of existence.  Like me, you may wander on occasion but a few moments back in the Gundam universe and you'll simply be quite unable to remember why.",1307059200,4,4390,4.91869918699187

After watching(and enjoying)the original movie trilogy, I decided to watch this series before moving on to Zeta Gundam. This way I would be watching them in order of the timeline. Anyway, I found this series difficult to get through. Cheesy, one dimensional characters with a weak hero(He cries often), and juvenile story-telling. This series ranks FAR below the original Mobile Suit Gundam, and just as far below Zeta Gundam. The animation is better because it is newer, but that is about it. I could barely finish the last disc.

Personally I find myself rooting for the ""bad"" guys in this series, but one of the great things about this series is the moral ambiguity and lack of a real ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"". The only real criticism I have is the awful opening and closing music, and the sort of forced romantic story elements.

While the action is ok it is a far cry from top notch and the storyline I would call immature at best. I was generally bored watching this and basically watched the whole series out of sheer curiosity on whether it would get any better, I was seriously disappointed.

2281773,5,B0009E32UC,"I will keep this concise, because spoilers and summaries of Gundam seem to me more than just an excercise in redundancy- it's dull.
Set in the original Gundam universe, U.C. 0083. Rookie mobile suit pilot Kou, of the rapid-steady rotting Federation, seeks to, in what I gathered, redeem and prove himself in MS combat against One Year War veteran Gato of the Zeon forces. Gato has stolen a prototype Gundam capable of lunching nuclear assault, and left Kou watching with much to prove to both his enemies and allies. This is what I found interesting about the series. Despite the obvious threat Gato poses, the focus of the main character seems to be on himself, rather than Earth and its protecting of and yaddayadda. Excellent battle sequences and, I think, Kou develops as a character, quite nicely.

Definitely not as heart-wrenching as 0080. Nowhere near as brilliant as 08th Team. Notably, it is a very good tie in between the original series and Zeta. This series is definitely worth a watch. It is perhaps the most ""realistic"" of all the Gundam series, leaving Newtypes and (those new-fangled) Coordinators out of the picture and replacing these protagonists with very natural pilots with talent and developed ability. More thought and strategy than ESP going on, in 0083.

I've been a fan of Gundam since Wing premiered in the States. Not having enjoyed Turn A, Victory, or G Gundam, whomever is reading this can take that into account when deciding whether or not to delve into their wallets and purchasing this collection. It's worth it for the episodes, but don't expect much more. The day Bandai gives us our money's worth for being Gundam fans is the day we can die happy (after watching said DVDs, of course). That being said, keep in mind that the voice acting can either be bad, spotty, or just downright annoying at any given time(s) throughout this series.

It seems that just anyone can walk up to a gundam and start it up, you would think with all the advanced technlogy it would take to create the hugh destructive power behind one of these machines someone would be able develope an ignition key system for it or even might think to put a padlock on the door. They must really have faith in the honor system.

2281776,5,B0009E32UC,"The gap between Mobile Suit Gundam and Zeta Gundam was filled with the exciting release of Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory. In Japan it was very popular upon it's airing, when it came to America via Cartoon Network's Toonami: Midnight Run programming in 2002 it was met with quite a bit of fanfare as well. When I first watched it one night I thought it was amazing compared to the other series that I had already seen, mostly because I had only just seen Mobile Suit Gundam and Gundam Wing at that point.

Now, 4 years later, I can truly appreciate it more. I've seen all of Zeta Gundam, Char's Counterattack, 08th MS Team, Gundam F91, and some other Gundam series from different universes since then. When I bought this boxed set a few months back I then watched it with better knowledge. It gets very interesting in the final episodes because you can see how it's transitioning into Zeta Gundam. The plot twist at the end is an eye opener as well.

Kou Udaki and Anavel Gato are better protagonists than the newtypes in other series because they have the weaknesses that the newtypes don't; they have to make up for it with true grit.

I find Gato to be a very likeable character even though he fights for Zeon, he is honorable and isn't dirty in the way he does things unlike some other Zeon thugs. As for Kou, he's a pushover in the beginning of the series. However, he becomes quite impressive (and possibly comparable to a newtype) in skill as the series approaches its finale. That's why I like Kou and Gato so much more than Amuro and the various other newtypes, it's not a battle of who has the better psychic powers of perception. These guys have to rely on instincts and guts.

I think the viewer connects to them more because of that.
