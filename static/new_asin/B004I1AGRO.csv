4381574,1,B004I1AGRO,"Spoiler alert:
Being raised an all  American girl with parents who immigrated from India in the mid 1960's. I found the movie to be stereotypical of Indians in America. I thought the father and son were bit of a jerk.  The daughter had no voice and didn't even have the guts to stand up to her father.  Not all American Indians are that shallow, meek and traditional. I know that I am not.  The only character that seemed easygoing was the mother. I liked the clash of the American neighbors. I found the artist boy a bit of wimp. It's like you want to kick him and tell him to stand up to the idiot Indian father and tell the stupid girl to speak her mind. Most adults move out of their parents home.  This movie makes it sound as if all Indian Americans live with their parents and obey them which is Bullshit. Some people actually become their own person.  Story very predictable and unrealistic.  Watch it if you have nothing to do but don't watch it if you want to learn about American Indian families living in the U.S.

The outfits were pretty but the singing and dancing were tacky.  I couldn't stand the depressing Indian music.  My advice fast forward the music and the dancing. If you want to watch a good Indian movie with lively music and dancing I would recommend Monsoon Wedding. It's at least funny and entertaining.",1414800000,,1332,4.444444444444445

4381578,5,B004I1AGRO,"What a great story about love, family, tradition, spirituality, money, class, and art.

I kept thinking about the similarity in theme/tone to the movie Monsters' Ball - one of my favorites.

If you're into how our lives intertwine, how we are connected, how we can break negative cycles and overcome our love for the past, and give in to love for what may be, then you just might dig this movie.

Watch it on Amazon Instant Video (free for Prime) under the title ""Breaking the Chain"" with an incorrect description (maybe someone will fix this...? I sent the Amazon Gods feedback...).",1392768000,,583,4.752475247524752
4381579,4,B004I1AGRO,"Living somewhat near Vancouver, Canada, where there are whole sections of the city and suburbs with Indian (or Chinese) immigrants, I found this movie to be quite interesting.  We hear often about the struggles the kids have with blending into the American/Canadian culture and with their parents who want them to retain the old culture from their home countries.  This movie is really about just such a struggle with an Indian brother and sister, and with their childhood neighbor (and his boorish brother).  The reason I downgraded it one star is because it seemed that the American kids adopted the Indian culture more than the Indian kids adopted the American culture.  [I believe if one immigrates to a different culture, one should adopt that culture, not expect the `natives' to adapt to your foreign culture.]",1315699200,,817,5.029629629629629
