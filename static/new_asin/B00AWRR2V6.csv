8558535,5,B00AWRR2V6,"I'm a big fan of Cathe (I wish I had discovered her earlier and not in the past few months!) and love her XTrain series.  While this isn't my favorite (""Cardio Leg Blast"" is) it's a great workout that hits all muscle groups and there isn't any repetition so there's no boredom.  It requires quite a bit of equipment but modifications are easy; for example, while the gliding discs work the muscles more intensely and the firewalker loop adds a leg jolt you can still do the moves and feel the effects.  Lots of squats, kicks, lunges, and compound exercises such as squats with an overhead press are included to raise the metabolic rate and increase calorie burn.  I loved the music as it was composed of recent hits with different lyrics - songs are a big motivator for me so that was a plus.  I wasn't a fan of the last series of moves, however, as they were too fast and very advanced.  Eight sets of eight (or ten?) pushups rapidly followed by full sit-ups was too much and I was afraid I'd hurt something do the speed.  Other than that I'd highly recommend this DVD for its variety and of course Cathe, who's got a very upbeat and encouraging personality.",1461196800,,1159,4.438679245283019
8558536,4,B00AWRR2V6,"I usually always given Cathe's videos a 5 (high 5 at that), and while this is a great exercise tape, I give it a 4 only because of the equipment needs (a leg band, resistance bands, different weights, and floor discs. Now, I have all of these, but the average buyer may not, and that is the only negative I have about this video. Pros of it are extensive - (1) good, demanding exercise (you should not get this if you do not regularly exercise nor enjoy going hard and strong in a workout); (2) combines both strength training and cardio, so its a good time saver; (3) her instructions are clear and her voice is very nice to listen to; (4) her comments come at the right time and place for me to motivate me without her being so commentary crazy that I get tired of her voice. I have many of Cathe's videos and have not been disappointed, but I know what she provides (you can see condensed versions of what each tape requires on her website) and she is exactly what I am looking for.",1437523200,,985,4.24468085106383
8558537,5,B00AWRR2V6,Very good all body workout.  Low impact but does the job.  I like the firewalker loop part.  AMAZING!,1423440000,,101,4.5
8558538,4,B00AWRR2V6,"I would give this workout 4.5 stars if I could.  I like this workout, but I don't love it.  I love metabolic training and I love Cathe.  I even did this workout several times to see if I felt differently, but the love just isn't there.

This workout is part of Cathe's Xtrain series.  It is 46 minutes of low impact metabolic training.  Metabolic training uses compound exercises and dynamic movement to keep the heart rate elevated.  You can burn fat and tone your muscles with this type of training.

Let me start with the positive.  There were several things I really enjoyed about this workout.  The things I enjoyed:

* The low impact moves that got my heart rate elevated but didn't stress my joints.  I felt energized and not exhausted at the end of the workout.

* No repeating moves.  You will not get bored. There were a few moves that I didn't care for, so I was especially happy that I didn't have to do them again. (See my comments below.)

* The unique moves.  The row and arrow is fun and different.

* Cathe's form pointers.  She reminds us to touch elbows to knees during the squat lunges and that little change really makes a difference!

* The workout versatility.  I didn't find this workout all that intense, but then again I am just coming off of an Insanity rotation and compared to Insanity, everything is easy.  I was able to use the same weights as Cathe.  I also thought squat section with the firewalker was easy.  That being said, you can certainly make the moves more difficult by increasing your weight or by using a heavier band.

* Plenty of premixes, both longer and shorter.  Like all the Xtrains, there are also Challenges and Bonus Workouts.  The challenge:  hip thrusts.  The bonuses:  Core 1 and Core 2.

Now, on to my annoyances.  They are:

* Lots of equipment is needed.  You are constantly switching between dumbbells, tubing, firewalker bands and gliding discs.  I have all that equipment, but the workout felt rushed and I felt that I wasn't really working with any one piece that long to make a difference.

* There were 3 moves that I hated:  alternating sit out, sprint shoot and sit up/push up combo.  I really tweaked my back doing the alternating sit out.  I am not blaming Cathe for this; we are responsible for knowing our body's limits and modifying accordingly.  I am a fit and an advanced exerciser who can usually keep up with Cathe.  I may not use as heavy a weight or I may not go down as low, but I keep up.  Not so with these 3 exercises.  I view this as a learning experience that I need to be more careful.

* Cathe didn't always tell us what body part we were working with an exercise.  I find this very helpful, especially with exercises that are new to me.  It helps me focus on form and where I should feel it working.

* Cathe doesn't give a lot of form pointers.  The intensity of this workout is intermediate, but the lack of form pointers makes it advanced.  I would have appreciated just a few more pointers for some of the new moves.  Or even a separate tutorial on these moves would have helped.

In spite of these annoyances, I do recommend this workout to those who like metabolic type training.  It's fun and it's different.",1364083200,5,3201,4.432758620689655
8558539,5,B00AWRR2V6,"first let me say i am a big women. i am over weight,and should be in beginer exercises. well i found no challenge you need to step out of your confort zone if you want to achieve anything including weightloss. so i picked up cathe. first let me say this for me is in no way easy,but is so worth it. this video is tough yet you can taylor it to fit your needs. if you are like me use lighter weights,and do not bend as far. if you are more advanced up your weights and bend real far.the choice is yours. befor you make a decision look at the previews on her page [...] and watch the preview. or there is a preview on collage.com or totalfitnessvideo.watch the video and decide. i bought the 9 pack saved money and so worth it.... good luck.",1359072000,,739,4.103448275862069
