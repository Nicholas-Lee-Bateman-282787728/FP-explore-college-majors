2756996,4,B000N6KEHU,"This is a pretty good DVD, but I'd caution anyone considering it for ASL that it seems to creep into Signing Exact English.  I'm using this for refresher purposes since I don't use ASL every day and when I do, its not ""heavy"" use.  This is a good DVD for refreshing and basic instruction, but for ASL beginners, go somewhere else, learn real ASL first, and then use this for learning vocabulary or simply for refreshing your memory on vocabulary.",1306713600,22,446,4.5625
2756997,5,B000N6KEHU,"This inexpensive dvd is surprisingly fun and easy.  The camera quality is decent throughout and there are a few real world scenes.  Mostly it is the host/developer woman giving an intro then explaining (and thankfully re-showing sometimes) signs.  She teaches as though it were in a classroom almost and is very interested in teaching. Lots of real life situations are covered at a pleasant pace.  It is certainly not part of a signing course but she covers a good bit in the 45 minutes or so, including alphabet/numbers, greetings, emergencies, etc.  I found it very helpful, although I had a somewhat exposed background in ASL already.",1286755200,18,637,4.971698113207547
