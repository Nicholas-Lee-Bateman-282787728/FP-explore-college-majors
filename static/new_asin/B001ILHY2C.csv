3649006,5,B001ILHY2C,"Although there weren't any points for running over civilians, Frankenstine and more than a half-dozen armor-plated cars made this a fun film.

Jason Statham's character is set up for killing his wife and conveniently imprisioned on Terminal Island, where the Death Race takes place. Without spoiling the little bit of plot there is, it should come as no surprise that Jason ends up driving a Mustang that would make Mad Max envious.

Men will like this one for the cars and action. Women will go to see the scenes where Jason is in various stage of undress.

Check it out!",1219536000,2,572,4.7
3649007,4,B001ILHY2C,"I hate just about every Paul W.S. Anderson film, but he actually pulled this one off. The action scenes are intense, helped by the use of practical effects, rather than CGI overkill. Just wait until you see the tanker truck getting flipped in slow motion. Almost as cool as the semi truck flip in The Dark Knight. Jason Statham is the action star of this decade. The man has muscles everywhere and does the most with his limited acting range. Ian McShane of HBO's Deadwood is given some good lines and is one of the more memorable characters in the movie. I hope he gets more big screen parts in the future. Joan Allen turns in performance I could have never pictured her doing before today, and it worked.

Death race will likely give you a headache with it's shaky camera movements and some of the dialogue could have used some work, but I had a great time. If your of the male gender, the cars, guns, explosions and babes will keep you entertained.

3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",1219449600,21,977,4.392265193370166
3649008,2,B001ILHY2C,"""Death Race"" is an action-lover's dream, a film overloaded with shootouts and explosions and crashes and mangled bodies, all to the eye-popping backdrop of back-to-back car chases. The music and sound effects are loud and assaulting, pretty much to the point of drowning out thought. That's probably what the filmmakers wanted, because God knows if anyone actually stopped to think about this film, they would realize how aggravating it is, not just in terms of the overwhelming action, but also in terms of the story, which is about as inconsequential as they get in films these days. It kind of makes you wonder why writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson even bothered with a screenplay, since all he really wanted was to blind us with stunts and deafen us with tire squeals and fireballs. It would be a miracle if a theater's sound system survived this film.

I suppose this is a case of self-punishment, seeing as this is technically the second time I've seen this movie. I was invited to a special sneak preview back in April, and I accepted with the hope that I'd at least find it entertaining. Boy, was I in for a rude awakening. Still, it wasn't a completed version of the film, so I figured I'd give it another chance come general release. Who knows? Maybe Anderson and editor Niven Howie would use that four-month period to rework the film, to somehow make it tolerable for the rest of us. Unfortunately, not much has changed; it seems that Anderson wanted to make nothing more than an extended stunt montage, filled to the brim with high-speed race scenes and dangerous weapons and characters that die violent, bloody deaths. If this is the kind of movie you crave, then Anderson has delivered exactly as he promised. For this particular audience, ""Death Race"" is dedicated.

It has a story, but does anyone really care? And is it worth noting that it's based on the 1975 film ""Death Race 2000""? In both cases, probably not. But I'll describe the story anyway, just in case. By the year 2012, many of the world's economies have collapsed. In the United States alone, unemployment is dramatically rising, and worse yet, major corporations have taken over the prison systems. They've profited essentially by turning penitentiaries into arenas, forcing the inmates to become gladiators. One prison on Terminal Island hosts a regular event called Death Race, which broadcasts live on the Internet to massive ratings. For Death Race, competitors drive heavily armored vehicles through an obstacle course, and in the end, it's just as much about staying alive as it is about winning. To make things more interesting, all cars are allowed to use weapons, including machine guns, oil, smoke, napalm, missiles, and spikes. The incentive is freedom; whoever wins five races will be released from prison.

Here enters Jensen Ames (Jason Statham), imprisoned after being framed for murdering his wife. He was once a famous racecar driver, something the warden of Terminal Island--the icy Hennessy (Joan Allen)--quickly picks up on. She offers him a deal: If he wins the next installment of Death Race, she will set him free. There's one catch. He has to pose as the most popular driver, Frankenstein, so named because he wore a mask over his horribly disfigured face. Unbeknownst to viewers and most of the prisoners, the real Frankenstein died; Hennessy knows that ratings depend on keeping his legend alive. With this in mind, the soft-voiced Ames goes along with the plan, holding out hope that he will someday see his infant daughter again.

All this setup material passes before anything of value sinks in. The rest of the film is a wall-to-wall series of brutal race scenes, all of which are visually and aurally aggressive. Eyes and ears alike will throb in pain by the time this movie ends. How can we enjoy it if it doesn't allow us to take in what's happening? The filmmakers relied on editing so lightening-fast, we barely notice one shot transitioning to the next. The few shots that go in slow motion are reserved for the racecar navigators, who, of course, are young, sexy women. You know the kind of shots I'm talking about; as they exit a car or a building, a sluggish camera captures close-ups of hair flipping gracefully and well-proportioned breasts heaving ever so delicately. They supposedly come from a women's correctional facility. One wonders: Are all female prisoners this good-looking in real life?

The navigator assigned to Ames is Case (Natalie Martinez), who, with the exception of one small bruise, remains miraculously unharmed after each race. Ames' mechanic is a man named Coach (Ian McShane), and he's grown so accustomed to life on Terminal Island that he refuses to leave, even if he's eligible for parole. And then there's Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson), who has a score to settle with Frankenstein. One question that inevitably comes up is who framed Ames. If you've seen the trailer for ""Death Race,"" then you already know the answer. If you haven't, it still isn't all that surprising, given the intelligence of the screenplay. I know movies like this will find an audience, no matter how much curmudgeons like me may complain about it. But doesn't it make you wonder why? Does no one appreciate a good story anymore? Is death and destruction all we have left? Are mindless stunts on their way to replacing actual plots? It's frightening to think that films like ""Death Race"" may be the rule instead of the exception.",1219363200,2,5455,4.89935064935065

3649062,5,B001ILHY2C,"This is one of those movies movies that I made a decision to buy blindly due to my being a lover of great action also I enjoyed Jason Statham's Transporter trilogy so this felt like a possibly great blind purchase.  Well as it rarely plays out for me, this movie proved to to completely deliver on all that it promised, in spades.

The movie focus's on Jensen Ames(Jason Statham), an ordinary guy that had a job in which was just closing leaving Jensen and his co-workers jobless and collecting their last paychecks.  Things soon get worse for Jensen as 2 vicious people of whom's appearances are completely covered by their black outfits break into Jensen's home, physically assault Jensen, and murder his wife.  It isn't long before poor Jensen is sent to a prison on an island in which the prison is corporately funded to put on a webshow called, ""Death Race"".  It's a show online in which people watch imprisoned racers kill eachother while racing.  While there he meets Lists, a highly talkative young prisoner/mechanic that is up on stories and stats on everyone and everything.  Soon evil and sadistic Warden Hennessey(Joan Allen) along with her brutal guard Ulrich(Jason Clarke, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Terminator Genisys) offer Jensen a chance to join the Death Race as their presumed dead, mask-sporting icon Frankenstein.  Hennessy promises that if Jensen races and wins as many times as she says then he will get a full pardon.  At first Jensen refuses but soon he decides to do it.  He then meets Coach and his sexy Navigator Case as he races for his freedom and the prison looks for high ratings from the viewers.

This movie is Jason Statham just how we all love him; wild, tough, and kicking a** and taking names.  His character Jensen Ames is a character that you truly feel for as you really feel bad about what happened to his wife and you wish him the pleasure of justice for her death as well as his freedom.  The mechanics are really cool characters that are able to equip the race cars with all kinds of cool weapons as well as repair.  They're also very likable characters.

If you're into lots of awesome action including cars crashing, bullets flying, lots of explosions, a fast pace, and above all some really awesome equipped with all sorts of state-of-the-art weaponry then this movie is one that you have got to see and believe.

Also there are really hot women in this movie as well that come from a women's prison to be both the male prisoners navigators but also to help them with the usage of the weapons as well.

For those who want to see Jason Statham give his enemies a smackdown as well, there is one fun scene of that.

The script to this movie is a work of brilliance with only occasional awkward lines.

The music is very well composed music perfect for any action sequence.

The cinematography is beautiful, well framed, and never dull.

My only criticism of this movie is the extremely irritating shaky cam issue.",1502755200,,2965,4.64176245210728

3649082,3,B001ILHY2C,"The road race movie has evolved quite a long way. From Gran Prix or Le Mans through Death Race 2000, Mad Max and ""The Wraith"" to a new generation. Mildly Miffed Maxine was a big disappointment and so I had fairly low expectations of Death Race when I came across it on Amazon Prime Video. This was streamed and I can make n comments about DVD quality or packaging.
Jason Statham plays an ex-driver who is in prison and who is persuaded to race for his freedom. Since the race is deadly it is called the ""Deat Race"". This film attempts to resurrect some elements of Death Race 2000, Frankenstein, female co-pilot, etc but ultimately it is too modern and too Hollywood for that to go far enough. There's no political satire here. The special effects are good as are the action sequences. The cast copes well with a poor script and poorly drawn, stereotypical characters. Enjoy this as an action movie with cars in and you won't go too far wrong. This will never be the cult classic that Death Race 2000 became. A big budget and Hollywood conservatism made sure of that.",1486252800,,1067,4.505154639175258

this new version is definitely not the same storyline as the 1975 version
the only difference is the new version is set in a Prison where the Prison warden runs the Death race's
Driven by Prisoners from the Prison
Joan allen's performance as the prison warden is ridiculous and silly she over acts alot of her scenes

where is the 1975 version was set in the Future where Death race was an American Game ruled by the American Government
where Racing Drivers trying to compete against each other throughout different states across America
and no rules applied so ofcourse some pedestrians get hit and run off etc

But my girlfriend drug me to the movies to see it. In my opinion, this movie has all the makings of a good action movie. It has a plot, not much of a plot, but it is there, and its not like everything happens at the beginning and the rest of the movie is just pointless violence, the story actually unfolds between scenes of violence. A small twist here and there. Hot girls, good special effects. And the best part, no sex scene. I hate sex scenes in action movies, especially long drawn out ones, its a waste of time and is only put there because they wanted to make the movie longer so they inserted a scene that has no plot value whatsoever, but why have plot when you can have boobs? I'm sorry but i'm not going to pay $9 a person to watch someone else get laid.",1423526400,,942,4.097297297297297

3649279,4,B001ILHY2C,"Better than Death Race 2000, with good acting and some good plot twists, but basically borrowed unmercifully from previous SF road-war flicks, though did it well.  Audio and video were very good.",1422144000,,195,5.09375
3649280,4,B001ILHY2C,"I loved this action flick, though I'm not even much of an action movie fan. The filmmakers not only updated the orignal, but set it perfectly in our modern age of social media and reality TV. This is one action film I'd recommend, especially given the notably good acting and awesomely fun driving sequences. The original film was essentially based almost entirely on the road race itself, while this one takes a (hmmm... how to avoid a pun here...) different path and incorporates more of the non-driving storyline. Anyway, long story short, I'd absolutely recommend this one - I ended up buying it on Amazon, rather than just continuing to rent it. :)",1422057600,,653,4.787610619469026

A hard working family man wrongly accused of his wife's murder has to put all his strength in winning a DEATH RACE if he wants to get out of a cruel warden's prison and regain his freedom again. Also if you want to see JASON STATHAM in another thriller in which he is playing the bad guy, then don't miss out on CELLULAR co-starring KIM BASINGER.

3649339,1,B001ILHY2C,"Death Race consists of painful and unpleasant sensations, a nauseous movie for kids with a mental age of between - 8 and 12 years, obsessed with stupid video games like Twisted Death Metal and Road Smash. Only a 12 year old boy with an upper limit IQ of 10 could find this offensive, moronic, childish nonsense ""fun.""

Death Race had a lot of guns, gun eye candy, gun flames and gun blow up scenes, but nothing else. The writing was dull and the prison aspect took away from the original story. Death Race fails as sci-fi (a future world or society is not explored).

Overall this movie just gets boring after watching the same cars drive around in a small circle over and over again with no people dying.

I was incredibly let down by this film. This is a phenomenally unintelligent movie.",1383091200,,790,4.510489510489511

3649345,5,B001ILHY2C,"Statham is good at being the underdog for some reason. He's always playing someone who's been wronged or betrayed etc. He's good at the revenge face, though, and in this film it really works for him. Great action scenes, a cause you want him to fight for and awesome death scenes. It's graphic, but not too graphic, if that makes sense.

3649353,3,B001ILHY2C,I dedicate this three stars to all the actors in this movie; the story is not one of the best but it's different and worth watching. The genre is inevitably violent and bloody so keep the children away from it. If you like racing and driving dangerously then this is the movies to watch. Special effects were pretty good too. Yes I recommend it.,1374105600,,345,4.40625

We were surprised when it turned out to be a great movie. Jason Statham does a great job in this movie as he does in all his films (even the ones that are just okay). The entire cast performs quite well. The story is even pretty good. It's a limited concept so there's only so much story that can take place but I think the did a great job with it. It was never going to win any Oscars or anything but if you're in the mood for a good action movie this is a movie that you should see.,1373155200,,611,3.8188976377952755

3649360,4,B001ILHY2C,"""Death Race"" is great! This is how the story goes: Terminal Island, New York: 2012. Overcrowding in the U.S. penal system has reached a breaking point. Prisons have been turned over to a monolithic Weyland Corporation, which sees jails full of thugs as an opportunity for televised sport. Adrenalized inmates, a global audience hungry for violence and a spectacular, enclosed arena come together to form the 'Death Race', the world's biggest, most brutal sporting event. Five-time NASCAR champion Jensen Ames is a man who has become an expert at survival. After eight years of hard time, he has only six weeks before reuniting with his family. But when Weyland demands a driver to headline the big game, Ames is forced to submit. Donning the costume of mythical rider Frankenstein, the racer becomes an instant crowd favorite, an unequaled sporting superstar. His face hidden by a metallic black mask, one convict will be put through a brutal three day challenge, with the trophy being the ultimate prize: freedom. The only catch is that he must survive a gauntlet of the most vicious criminals in this post-industrial wasteland to claim it. Driving a monster car outfitted with machine guns, flamethrowers and grenade launchers, Ames must now kill or be killed to win the most treacherous spectator sport on Earth: 'Death Race'.

The cast led by Jason Statham (as Jensen Ames) and Tyrese Gibson (as Machine Gun Joe) is great!

3649364,3,B001ILHY2C,"Death Race Two is actually a prequel to Death Race One which starred popular action actor Jason Statham of Crank and The Transporter fame.
Synopsis : We meet the driver monster played by actor Luke Goss before he became monster and we learn how the Death Race game developed and evolved from a gladiator type of game into the game that utilizes cars instead.
In Death Race Two we also meet actor Fred Koehler, better known as , List, the quite yet highly intelligent young man who helps Monster become the legendary driver he becomes.
We also get to meet the rest of Monster race crew led by favorite character actor, Danny Trejo.
Bottom line ... A good action movie but actor Luke Goss does not have the presence actor Jason Statham has, but still a good movie to see how it all began.",1366156800,,786,4.465277777777778

This reimaging occurs when Jensen Ames and all his co-workers are laid off from their steel mill job which looks suspeciously like Terminal Island.

He goes home to his wife.  He showers and comes down stairs to find his wife murdered, the killer points his finger at him like it is a gun as he leaves.  The police show up and he is accused of killing his wife.

He begrudgingly agrees, the previous Frankenstien died and he wore a mask so nobody will know.  If a prisoner wins 5 races he can go free.  The racers get female navigators, as the movie goes along the amount of people watching increases. The races look like a video game and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road-Warrior/dp/0790729342/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road Warrior</a>.

This is an action movie pretty much from get go, driven by the star power of Jason Statham and a lot of very cool cars.

No plot spoilers from me; Set in the near future, the story follows Jensen Ames (Statham) as he enters a prison system that has commercialized the ""Death Race"" as a for-profit venture. Prisoners can earn their freedom by winning five races in their highly weaponized and armored cars, but actually stand a much better chance of being killed in an audience pleasing fireball. The acting is decent, the action is great, and the special effects are quite good. There are a lot of plot holes, but they can be overlooked for the enjoyment of the movie.

This isn't a deep movie, but it is a fun action flick.

Anderson does a brilliant job of creating his own unique storyline and scenery while still paying homage to the Roger Corman classic. I hate when remakes try to duplicate the original. Case in point: Psycho. Possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. First of all, why would anyone remake an Alfred Hitchcock film?

Death Race has all the excitement of a good slasher/action movie, all the while keeping it, for the most part, down-to-earth by creating a believable storyline, and not using CGI for the stunts. Also, Joan Allen is awesome!

3649390,4,B001ILHY2C,"That is the question. Can this Aug/08 release/remake of Death Race equal or surpass the 70s original? My findings confirm that this new version indeed equals or surpasses the original film. From the acting,the stunts and special effects,they all add up to a nicely updated and badder version of Corman's original. And who should be on hand to pilot this version?;none other than Corman himself. It is chock full of some great actors  backing up star Jason Statham,such as British veteran Ian McShane,Joan Allen,Tyrese Gibson and even David Carradine,who drops by to play the original Frankenstein under that frightful mask. However there is something I think quite important to tell you that the case of this DVD does NOT;at least I could not see it. When you are at the main menu on the DVD there is an asterisk beside the unrated version saying this version MIGHT affect the playability of the movie. What the....? I do not understand why it would or should. Thankfully my player had no perceptible problems at all,but I thought you should be pre-warned as to what possibly to expect,as Universal seems unwilling to be honest enough to be upfront about it on the case. I deducted an entire star for this faux paux/deception.
The plot finds Statham,a hard working steel worker being laid off from his job. He goes home to his wife and while he is upstairs tending to his unsettled baby,a break in occurs in the kitchen. When Statham returns his wife is dead on the floor and he and the intruder have a scuffle. Statham is knocked down and out,but just before he fades out the killer makes a motion with his hand in the form of a shooting pistol. The killer has planted the knife in Stathams hand,so when the police arrive,it is Statham of course who is deemed to be the killer.
Fast forward and Statham is being taken to and incarcerated in the penal facility on Terminal island. No one escapes from this facility and for entertainment the warden,Joan Allen,has set up a Death race,in which prisoners who drive in it,after five consecutive wins,can get paroled out. The warden propositions Statham to take the place of a popular driver called Frankenstein,who died in the last race;one win away from getting his freedom.
Statham agrees but something is not right. Statham was a former race driver in civilian life,so is it coincidence that he is there?During the first race,Statham sees a hand gesture from of the other drivers,the same one from the killer of his wife. On top of this some of his equipment has been mysteriously malfunctioning. It seems the warden has used one her own prisoners to knock off Stathams wife,in order to continue on with Frankenstein. Also Statham will apparently never get out of the prison,if the warden has anything to do with it.
The deadly races,viewed by millions on the internet,continues full blown as the drivers slowly dwindle down the playing field,through horrific crashes/deaths. Statham and his arch rival Tyrese Gibson,go head to head, but the two have agreed to work together,first to eliminate a souped up tanker truck called the Dreadnought,and then to escape off the island.
Gibson's truck is loaded with missiles and nicely blows a hole in the side of the track big enough for the two of them to leave the facility. Both ditch their rides and escape on foot,while the warden gets a small thank you package,in which is an explosive.
The next time we see Statham and Gibson they are working as mechanics down in Mexico and enjoying their new found freedom and life.
I certainly prefer the extended version,with an extra 6 minutes of footage added,as it fleshes out the characters and the plot a little bit more. But in the end,as always,it's up to you to decide for yourself. The race itself takes up most of the film,and the stunt works/car crashes and technical effects used to create it all are nothing short of spectacular. Statham is right on his game in this one,with his usual intensity and menace.
Technically speaking we have the theatrical and unrated versions on one single disc(one sided),and both are clear and crisp and in their w/s a/r's of 2:35:1. Extras includes some featurettes on the films making and the stunt work,and commentary by its director.
All in all a nice film with some awesome stunt work and rad racing. The race will have you on the edge of your seat,guaranteed. One star deducted for Universal's unforgivable lapse in pre-warning the consumer about possible playability issues with the unrated version. 3 1/2 stars.",1344729600,2,4499,4.835278858625162

3649393,5,B001ILHY2C,"The Blu Ray release of Death Race has two discs in the package, and some extras that are, while not unique, not standard either.

First of all, regarding the second disc in the package: You will receive a standard blu-ray case, with two discs inside.  The second disc is a DVD Digital Copy disc (along with a cardboard insert and installation code), not a second Blu Ray disc.  The insert states ""code may not be valid after 12/31/09"".  Since that is more than two years ago now, I doubt the digital copy disc will work any longer (I did not try it).  There is no indication on Amazon's site what the second disc is, so now you know for sure.

The extras are more than what you get with most Blu Ray discs.  The first clue is that something is different is that a ""User's Guide to Death Race"" is included in the package.  Did you ever wonder what those colored buttons on your Blu Ray player's remote control were for?  They're used by this Death Race Blu Ray disc.

The value of the extras, like beauty, is ""in the eye of the beholder"".  Plug an active internet cable into your Blu Ray player and you can text your buddies while you watch the movie.  Also, in some fashion you can record and share your own commentary.  Both are useless to me, but perhaps you're interested.

The disc has your standard (and insightful, imho) audio commentary.

Something unusual, and which I find interesting, is a PIP option where, while watching the movie, a second smaller window opens and you get behind-the-scenes information matching what's on the screen at that moment, cast interviews, etc.  This is the only disc I own with this capability.

The last extra, called ""tech specs"" (I think - going by memory), is something you can bring up while watching the movie.  It brings up details about each driver, their sentence, etc.  Probably not something you'll refer to more than once or twice, but it's a nice add-on for those initial viewings.

The extras I've listed above are not an all-inclusive list, but you get the idea: this disc offers something beyond your standard movie, audio commentary, trailers, and featurette release.  The picture quality is very good, too, Accordingly, I rate this release 5 stars.

Update June 6, 2012: As my blu-ray collection has increased, I've gotten a couple more discs that have the same or similar ""unusual special features"" mentioned above, complete with ""user's guide"" documentation.  So it's obvious that a particular company puts these features on their discs, that they are not unique to this movie.  But the above lets you know they're here, anyway.",1329091200,,2588,4.7

If a prisoner can win five races, he wins his freedom.  Our hero is a man wrongly accused of a murder he didn't commit.  But he takes on the challenge to win his freedom and reunite with his daughter.  This new incarnation is loosely based on Roger Corman's B-movie classic, Death Race 2000.  The DVD is packed with testosterone and includes both the theatrical release and an `unrated' version of the film that includes a couple of extra minutes of footage that provide an extra minute or two of thrills.",1292457600,,1146,4.471153846153846
3649408,4,B001ILHY2C,"DEATH RACE delivers pretty much exactly what it sets out to deliver.  If you're expecting anything like convincing character development (or ANY character development), a credible plot or incisive dialogue...you have not read the description of the film or seen any of the previews.  If, however, you are looking for a film with lots of car chase action, gory deaths and more car chase action with a touch of gunfire...then DEATH RACE fits that bill.

It's just a couple of years in the future, but apparently, our economy has gotten worse, and our prison population has exploded.  Run by private companies, the penal system has developed a novel way to make money.  They have inmates chase each other around a lengthy track in the middle of the prison island in souped-up, heavily modified and armored vehicles.  A race to the death.  Millions upon millions of Americans pay up to $99 to get live streams of these races.  (I did the math...apparently each race must gross somewhere between $4.5 and $7 BILLION!)

Jason Statham is framed for the murder of his wife, just so he can be imprisoned and compelled to race.  If he can win, he will be freed and can see his infant daughter again.  You see, Statham was a famous race car driver at one time, but fell on hard times.  Now he, and his rag-tag team of mechanics (led by Ian McShane), must wage battle against the most ferociously resilient moving vehicles ever devised.  And Statham also wants to find out who killed his wife and how the warden (Joan Allen...I hope she received a HUGE paycheck for lowering herself to this junk) is involved.

I will give the movie credit for not skimping on the chase scenes.  They are lengthy, noisy, fast, crazily edited, violent and satisfying on a visceral level.  Many lower budget action films will promise lots of action, but have lots of scenes of endless talking instead.  DEATH RACE gives us a quick, brutal opening race and then three more lengthy races to enjoy during the duration of the film.  The action in the races defies the laws of physics, of course...but there are inventive moments of mayhem.

Jason Statham, who can be fun (THE BANK JOB showed he actually has skills.  The CRANK films show he has a sense of humor) is fairly flat in this film.  Allen plays her part exactly the same throughout.  McShane chews the scenery, but he comes closest to making something of the sketchy dialogue and character he is given.  Tyrese Gibson, as a rival driver delivers yet another flat, uninteresting performance.

I'm actually thinking this film should be 3.5 stars.  It is, on any critical or analytical level, pure junk.  But with your sound system turned to 11 and your brain turned to about 2...it features well-made violence and chaos which can be enjoyed for 90 guilty-pleasure minutes.

(By the way, I haven't seen Roger Corman's DEATH RACE 2000 in decades...but I think the two films bear little resemblance.  Corman gets a producing credit here...but honestly, the film has more in common with THE RUNNING MAN than Corman's cheesy classic.)",1289088000,,3052,4.772900763358779

3649414,3,B001ILHY2C,"Hollywood is well-known for trotting out the big and mindless action films and ""Death Race"" is certainly no different, in that regard. The basics of the plot are a pretty well-traveled affair and none of the actors does any real stretching beyond their character's needs. From Joan Allen's ""ballbuster"" warden, to Jason Statham's ""hard-ass"" hero, to Ian McShane's ""Yoda-like"" veteran inmate, nothing new, innovative or different is brought out.

Of course, no one really sees films like this for deep and meaningful performances. It's all about the action and this one gives you plenty of it. The car battles are done exceedingly well. You actually feel like you are in the vehicle, as the action unfolds. The stunts on the track are pretty much what you expect. If you like to watch fast cars and big explosions, this film will not fail you.

One of the things that's interesting about this film, is exactly how it is connected to Roger Corman's cult classic ""Death Race 2000."" Originally, this was to be a sequel, with futuristic floating cars, like out of ""Back to the Future Part II,"" but the expense forced that to be changed. The film's writer/director, Paul W.S. Anderson, has said that this is meant as a prequel to Corman's film, but since this takes place AFTER the time period of it, I find that hard to swallow.

So, for myself, I see it as an updated remake, which I normally find very putrid, since most remakes are of films that are already good on their own. But ""Death Race"" is of that rare breed, where the remake can be taken on it's own and enjoyed, without it being disrespectful to the previous version. Something made much easier, by the guest voicing of (the late) David Carradine as ""Frankenstein"" (the same character he played in Corman's classic original).

So, while ""Death Race"" isn't a film that will leave you pondering deep philosophical questions about life and humanity, it manages to pack in plenty of thrills and action that one comes to expect of the typical summer flick. It's simply big, dumb fun and very re-watchable! What every action blockbuster aspires to be. It is sure to appeal to the 14-year old in every guy.",1273017600,,2157,4.744
3649415,1,B001ILHY2C,"Death Race consists of painful and unpleasant sensations, a nauseous movie for kids with a mental age of between - 8 and 12 years, obsessed with stupid video games like Twisted Death Metal and Road Smash.  Only a 12 year old boy with an upper limit IQ of 10 could find this offensive, moronic, childish nonsense ""fun.""

Death Race had a lot of guns, gun eye candy, gun flames and gun blow up scenes, but nothing else. The writing was dull and the prison aspect took away from the original story.  Death Race fails as sci-fi (a future world or society is not explored).

Overall this movie just gets boring after watching the same cars drive around in a small circle over and over again with no people dying.

3649417,5,B001ILHY2C,"I first saw this movie when it came out in theaters. I am still surprised at how good it actually was. I really didn't want to see it because it looked and sounded so stupid. But my girlfriend drug me to the movies to see it. In my opinion, this movie has all the makings of a good action movie. It has a plot, not much of a plot, but it is there, and its not like everything happens at the beginning and the rest of the movie is just pointless violence, the story actually unfolds between scenes of violence. A small twist here and there. Hot girls, good special effects. And the best part, no sex scene. I hate sex scenes in action movies, especially long drawn out ones, its a waste of time and is only put there because they wanted to make the movie longer so they inserted a scene that has no plot value whatsoever, but why have plot when you can have boobs? I'm sorry but i'm not going to pay $9 a person to watch someone else get laid.

The setting of the movie is a little farfetched but somewhat realistic. Bad economy, the country is failing, there aren't enough taxes to keep the prison system running, so the prisons are bought out by private companies. The game Death Race is created as a way to get rich and as an alternative to the death penalty. A simple yet creative idea.

There is a lot of violence with blood and gore. However, it is focused moreso on the action and violence than the blood and gore. Meaning the blood and gore is only there to compliment the action, so they didn't rely on the blood and gore to make the movie.

Jason Statham and Tyrese Gibson are both good actors and they both fit their parts well. A working class white guy whose employer had to shut down, gets framed and goes to prison where he gets drug into playing the game and slowly uncovers the plot to milk him for all of the money he is worth by the greedy female warden. Then a black guy who has been in prison and has been playing the game for a long time, he is determined to be the best and win his freedom but always gets the shaft, once again thanks to the greedy female warden.

Plot, action, violence, good special effects, good acting, no wasting your time with a boring love story. After listing all of those things I have just realized that this movie is the polar opposite of the Twilight series. So, if you are like me and hate the Twilight saga because it is nothing but a bunch of emotional crap aimed at, like, teenage girls who can, like, so relate to, like, having a vampire boyfriend. And you believe that vampire movie without violence is like a car without an engine, you can get into it if you want to be its not like your gonna go anywhere with it, Death Race might be a good movie for you.",1271116800,9,2714,4.213461538461538
3649418,4,B001ILHY2C,"As many of you may have suspected, this is a remake (of sorts) of Roger Corbin's cult classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Race-2000/dp/6304864264/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Race 2000</a>.  Of course, this one has some twists to it.  First off, in the original the drivers were all competing for prize $$ (if I remember correctly?).  In this one, they're lifers in prison whose only chance of getting out is to win 5 races.

Like the original, the ""racing"" is filled with violence, although the present version has much more intense violence than the campy violence of the 1970s flick.  Also like the original, women ride along too, only in this one they're the navigators for the men.  They, of course, are female inmates who have the capability of ""punching out"" of the vehicle should things go badly.  Not too surprisingly, the navigators are all smokin' hot as the deathrace is broadcast on PPV & video-streamed on the Internet.  Hot babes + souped up cars + violence drives up ratings!

Unfortunately, the present movie lacks a staple of Roger Corbin movies which the original did not omit: gratuitous nudity.  That's too bad, especially as they made an Unrated version.  But, guess you can't have everything.

Jason Statham is one of the better action hero actors out there now (most of the others are too old and / or have retired, and John Cena can't act).  If you like Statham movies in general, you're bound to like this one.  If you enjoyed the original Deathrace, then this one is worth a look.

""You rented me a remake!?""
""Trust me, its not"".
""You know how much I like Roger Corman films, especially Death Race 2000"". I told him.
""You'll see"".

I was prepared to see another classic film utterly destroyed by the remake-hatchet, and to my suprise, I was wrong.

In short,its an enjoyable adventure romp with some good and some bad things of the movie.

1)PLOT - Laid-off steelworker gets framed for killing his wife. Kinda cliche since that kind of plot has been used numerous times since 'The Fugitive'.
Still, it works for the reason later on. 85% Rating.

2)VEHICLES - I'm a Twisted Metal fan(not of 3rd and 4th installment), and the way the cars(and truck) were designed reminiced of this game series. Very nicely done, especially the killer rig. Awesome! 100% Rating.

3)CHARACTERS - Didn't need the ""showgirls"" theme with the navigators leaving the bus. Tasteless.
The loud-mouth from '2Fast&2Furious' as Machine Gun Joe. Interesting choice.
'Frank' was nothing more than a mask. Okay I guess, but rather lame here as well.
The warden I feel redeemed things here. A look of an angel with a devil hidden inside. Excellent character from beginning to end. 40% Rating.

4)ACTION - The fight scene in the cafeteria reeked of 'Shawshank Redemption'.
The vehicular action overall was great, aside from the maneuver of driving backwards ala '2Fast2Furious'. That was lame.  75% Rating.

OVERALL -
I know most(if not all) see this film as a remake of 'Death Race 2000'. To me,its not. This film seemed inspired by the Roger Corman film. There is a lot of things that seperate it from that film. Character background. An actual plot - Blackmail, backstabbing, revenge, and some drama mixed in nicely.

However, I don't see this film ever becoming a classic. Only as an enjoyable action film. Its definatly not a perfect film. There are some things that could be removed, but everyone's tastes vary. Me, I watch it for the vechicular mayhem, and the destruction they leave in their wake. I could care less about the eye-candy. Things blowing up and getting wrecked. YES!

So in closing, 'Death Race' is not a remake to me. Just a great action film with lots of explosions, and a plot added to the mix.",1262217600,2,2306,4.80050505050505
3649420,5,B001ILHY2C,"Director Paul W. S. Anderson's Death Race (2008), is a brutal, over the top, balls to the wall, action thriller, that satisfies both the need for speed, and an appetite for destruction.  Reality is not a serious consideration in this futuristic fantasy set in the year 2012, where condemned prison inmates participate in the Death Race, a contest where the competition is so fierce, that drivers statistics include both wins, and kills.  Risking death for possible freedom, before a pay-per-view audience, the Death Race is the latest deadly evolution in reality entertainment.

An extremely ripped Jason Statham (Crank, The Transporter), is Jensen Ames, a husband and father, who because of his experience driving race cars, is framed for the murder of his wife.  Sentenced to Terminal Island penitentiary where the Death Race is held, Ames is offered an opportunity by the hardass Warden Hennessey (Joan Allen).  Frankenstein, an extremely popular driver, has just died from injuries sustained in a crash.  Maintaining the illusion that `Frank' is still alive, would be very profitable, and also possible, since Frank wore a mask, and can't be identified.  Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson), the driver who sent Frank's car spinning down the track in flames, is eager to resume their rivalry.  With racing his only chance of reuniting with his baby daughter, Ames agrees to drive.  Headed by Coach (Ian McShane, Jesus of Nazareth), Ames's pit crew is in on the deception.  The final member of the racing team, is an inmate from a women's prison, Elizabeth Case (Natalie Martinez), the course navigator.

The film's drive to survive premise, is straightforward and without many added frills.  The Warden concerned only with profits, arranges for the murder of Ames' wife, just to get him into Terminal Island.  The killer is Pachenko (Max Ryan, The Foreigner), a vicious convict, who is also a driver.  He and Ames have a spectacularly brutal battle, but are forced to settle matters on the race course.  Ryan shines, as the mangy guy you love to hate.

The race consists of three stages.  With weaponized cars, and wicked hazards integrated into the course, each stage is more exciting and dangerous than the last.  Cars are destroyed, and drivers perish in the carnage, with no one shedding a tear.  Only the winners matter.  It is hard to get bored by the various racing sequences, as the action is extremely well staged, and realistic looking, with new stunts and hazards featured in each race, the results are breathtakingly awesome.

No one seems to notice that Ames is never around during a race, except perhaps Machine Gun Joe, who was guessed that his hated rival Frankenstein, has been replaced by Ames.  With the two drivers set to compete in the final race, is any cooperation possible?  With Frank on the verge of winning his freedom, The Warden is prepared to blow him sky high, but an unexpected detour ruins her plans.

Death Race is a gripping, high speed adrenaline rush, that is at the top of the fantasy action genre.  The realistic approach to action taken by the filmmakers, and the grungy, gritty industrial setting, creates a stark, tense, atmosphere for the contest.  Much of the backstory regarding the film is discussed by Paul Anderson, and producer Jeremy Bolt in their commentary track.  Bringing their experience from doing films based on the Resident Evil video games, the ultra-violent, breakneck speed, action scenes in Death Race display a video game quality.  Also covered is the role that Roger Corman played in the careers of the two men, and the making of this film, which is inspired by Corman's 1975 film, Death Race 2000.  Corman also serves as executive producer for this film.

3649423,4,B001ILHY2C,"I love the original Death Race 2000 for its truly warped sense of humor, and while this one can't touch it for laughs, it is all told a better movie.

I was surprised, in fact, by how entertaining and even smart this film is. It certainly looks amazing in blu-ray, especially Martinez, who almost justifies blu-ray tech all by herself. Statham is at home in this kind of grim but tongue in cheek action blaster, and he's perfect in his role. The rest of the cast is also solid, but McShane takes the cake, as usual. This guy is always great, in everything! Why he isn't yet as ubiquitous as Michael Caine is a mystery, but count on seeing a lot more of him in the next few years as producers see his value. He can make a bad film watchable, and take a good film like this into near-great territory.

I particularly appreciated the intelligence of this script, and its willingness to lay the social commentary on, but not too heavily. The original presaged our present, pathetic addiction to mindless reality shows by 25 years, and this one continues to point out how close we are to the days of Romans feeding folks to lions for #1 Neilson ratings.

On top of that there is a whiz-bang action flick here, reminiscent of Road Warrior in its wise decision to use mostly live stunts instead of CGI. It works, and in high-def this thing is non-stop in-yo-face action.

A solid cast is headed by Jason Statham as Jensen Ames, an ex-con framed for murder to get him behind the wheel of one of the death cars.  Joan Allen plays the cooly sadistic prison warden managing and manipulating the pay-for-view race.  Natalie Martinez is Ames' tough but attractive navigator. Tyrese Gibson is scary as Ames homicidal main competitor.  Ian McShane steals the show as an aging but savy prison car mechanic.

Director Paul Anderson tries to inject a little plot by giving Statham a baby girl on the outside to live for, and a killer on the inside to take revenge on, but mostly this movie is about the violent, almost video game-quality action around the race course.  Cars careen around the circuit, firing machine guns and dispensing napalm and other goodies while whittling down the competition.  The intervels between race sets provide short opportunities to establish character motivation and set up a double surprise ending.

WHAT A RIDE! Heard about ""chic flicks"", well this is definitely a guy film.  The experience was riveting and left us speechless.  We were transfixed by the non-stop marathon of cars, fights, violence and babes in hi-definition and incredible HD surround sound. Definately a testosterone ride/boost with no redeming qualities whatsoever: none, zippo.

This movie is nearly two hours of pure escapist joy.
Besides extreme non-stop action, it includes an occasional cheesy slow-mo hair-waving in-the-air shots of ""babes"" getting in and out of cars. Campy yes. Boring no.
Fun yes.
Highly recommended for what it is: fights, extreme racing, lots of gritty action shots.

This movie, however, is set in the year 2012 when American society is supposedly collapsing and regressing into a barbaric age where prisoners are used for a spectacle car race in a revival of the gladiators and chariot races from the days of the Roman coliseum combats around 80A.D.

 Jason Statham has been set up for the murder of his wife and ends up in a penitentiary full of hardened criminals where he is procured as the replacement for a recently killed racer, named Frankenstein, whose face was so badly scarred that he wore a metal mask and hence his name. Paul W.S. Anderson has directed other sci-fi movies, notably the Resident Evil movies, Event Horizon, and Alien vs. Predator. Here again he uses his considerable skills as a director to deliver this tongue in cheek thrill ride. Joan Allen also stars as the evil jail house warden whose only interest is in the ratings of the death race TV show and the money garnered from the death races. What's not to like in this entertaining spectacle which is spiced up with the sexy Natalie Martinez as Statham's assistant navigator, and the gloriously metallic music supplied by Paul Haslinger?

The blu-ray comes with the theatrical and unrated versions of the movie.

This movie is packed full of action and has a simple enough story that it is quickly established for the audience and quickly moves to action, action, action.  The concept seems like a mix between The Running Man and the Twisted Metal video games.  The main character is framed for murder and sent to jail where he gets thrown into a brutal game of survival and hopefully freedom (sounds like the Running Man, huh?) and the cars are racing around with an arsenal of weaponry and armor on a race course with it's own hidden dangers.  The races are amazing to watch and the ""weapons"" and ""armor"" and ""death"" symbols cars must cross over to allow use of their cars' related function brings to mind the Twisted Metal video game.

Here's why:

Death Race:

* IS FAST HI-QUALITY ACTION-PACKED with LOT'S of SHOOTING, EXPLOSIONS, CAR CRASHES, COOL CARS and AMAZING DRIVING STUNTS!!!!
* The new giant tank-truck character was SUPERB!
* When it comes to the action scenes they are HARDLY interrupted by blah,blah,blah!
* The idea of using a martial arts scene with Jason Statham was COOOL!
* The characters and their stories are SOOO INTERESTING!
* The SLOW-MO shooting was AWESOME!
* The costume desing is SOOO DARK!
* The dark setting was very good.

Death Race 2000: (70's original version)
The description of the original Death Race is everything opposite to this new version, but here are some pros:

* The cars look kind of cool by being desing as wild animals or blades.
* The blood and gore is a little more intense.
* The concept and rules of the race are WAY TO CRUEL!!!
* The street fight between Sylvester Stallone and David Carridine is something that we will never see again.

3649438,4,B001ILHY2C,"""Death race"" is a well conceived remake of the well known futurist film Death Race dated from 1975 and starred by David Carradine (followed of Deathsport).

Because and despite of the predictability of the script there are thundering car chases  and hair raising hair sequences that will keep you at the border of your seat.

Hennessey is a devilish commander and chief director of prison who really knows to deal with the green bucks entertaining the vast audience through Internet in 1912.

Paul Henderson (supported by the clinical eye of Roger Corman) comes back with this one thousand plot of the good guy sent to prison due a supposed crime he never committed. A dark and sinister conspiracy is right behind because the show needs more blood to nourish the survey.

The sharp comparison between the modern audiences and the great crowds in the Roman Empire remits to the most famous chariots race in the cinema. Because when ""The machine"" makes it appearance, Ben Hur comes immediately to our memory and these hopeless cons of today are just like these condemned to death gladiators in the Roman sand, fighting against lions or through endless and deadly combats all the way through still one of them wins.

As is usual in this type of films you really should not worry about making use of six neurons of your brain. Just let the wings of the modern ad spectacular special effects squad makes it for you and as the reminded story tellers of the ancient times. There will be blood but at the end the justice will prevail.",1248048000,,1526,4.7180451127819545

3649446,3,B001ILHY2C,"DEATH RACE

This is for those who don't know another remake that was put out there, but unlike most I was actually excited about this one. I knew that this was one that needs the brain shut off and that really won't have character development, but that is ok. The thing that I was happy about is that the original films legendary producer Roger Corman returns as a producer on this film, that's enough for me. I know some people were worried because Paul W.S. Anderson is the writer/director of this film, but he is an action director and on that level he succeeds. Still this is a remake and with that there will always be disappointments, when watching this I felt like they missed a lot of opportunities. By that I mean this could have been a mindless, fun, and wonderfully violent EPIC film, instead it is the first three and just a decent flick.

After 2008 the economy started to fall through [yikes that is kinda happening] and the crime rate rises while every one losses their jobs. This sets things up for prisons to be very corrupt and very full, makes things interesting. At one prison in particular the warden has a little reality show on the internet called ""DEATH RACE"". An event that pits inmate against inmate in a race to the finish line, the only problem is you may be finished before you get there. Why do the inmates agree to do it you ask, well because if the win 5 times [I think is the number] you win your freedom. Yeah that sounds great for the population a crazy prisoner gets released from jail into the public after killing other prisoners live on a show, break out the welcome wagon.

It seems a racer named Frankenstein [David Carradine from the original for a quick cameo] is killed right before he wins his freedom, seems he was the fan favorite and Warden Hennessey needs him back in the races. So she sends out a prisoner to frame a famous former race car driver named Jensen Ames, it looks like he killed his wife so he goes to jail only to become the new Frankenstein. Of course he doesn't want to but he needs to be freed to see his daughter, so at least that much makes sense. So we are off to the races I guess to a fun filled violent experience to see who will win it, I mean it will be a close race. Jason Statham has driven many a fast car and Tyrese was ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" so it should be close.

This film is far from the original mainly because the first film is such a classic amongst the Corman fans like myself, but to be honest this is a new film for a new day and Roger did sign off on it. I find this film to be a really good buddy film, and I don't mean like a buddy cop movie or anything like that. I mean this film is best viewed eating and drinking with your friends; you can all get just as loud as the film and have a mindless good time. My brother, my girl, and a few others all enjoyed this and I think it was because of the atmosphere, good times had by all. Don't get me wrong you can enjoy this at any time but that is best way to watch this type of film I believe.

As far as the direction it is pretty straightforward, it is all centered around the action and that is fine since it doesn't try to be anything else. Anderson does a good job here as far as that aspect is concerned but don't expect a lot of character development. The deaths are really cool at least in my opinion even if there some over the top moments, but with a title like Death Race what do you expect. The cars are fun and match the atmosphere and look of the film and the action is solid, also The Dreadnought is a cool killing machine but it comes and goes to quick I think. Jason Statham is excellent in the lead role and really I felt he was the best guy for this type of flick. Tyrese though is another story because I just didn't see him in this, he did a great job with his character and maybe because of the lack of script he just seemed, I don't know. Joan Allen on the other hand I felt was great in this and made for a believable villain, I wanted to say something else. Natalie Martinez is decent in this and Ian McShane as Coach is very good in this as well.

To me this was a fun film although far from a classic it is still good enough in my opinion for a rental at least. I bought it as to continue owning all things Corman, don't have everything yet but I will get there eventually. Like I said before order some pizza crack open a few drinks [whatever you sip on] and watch this with you friends. It is a good time if you turn off the brain; at least I had fun with it.",1243296000,3,4522,4.121315192743764
3649447,4,B001ILHY2C,"Death Race is an updated remake of the cult classic movie, Death Race 2000.  Where Death Race 2000 took place out on the streets of America, this movie takes place in a high security prison called Terminal Island.  It is the year 2012, and the US economy has collapsed, and private companies now run our prisons.  ""Gladiator Death Races"" now entertain the masses of America, and also fund Terminal Island.  Inmates drive custom death cars around a prison death track.  Inmates may acquire offensive or defensive weapons to eliminate the other racers.  The object is to be the last inmate to cross the finish line after 3 stages of the race.

  Into this scenario comes Jensen Amos ( Jason Statham), who has been accused and sentenced for the murder of his wife and child.  Jensen is offered the opportunity to stand in for Frankenstein, one of the premier death racers, who has died in his last race unbeknownest to the public and other racers.  Jensen becomes familiar with his pit crew led by Coach (Ian McShane), and his female assistant, Case (Natalie Martinez).  Together, they take on the other Death Racers in the 2 races leading up to the Final Race.  Jensen's big rival is Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson).  The warden in charge of Terminal Island and the Death Races is Hennessey, played by a serious Joan Allen.

  There is plenty of action, explosions, and deaths in Death Race.  One of my favorite scenes, is in Stage 2 of the race, where the racers have to not only take on each other, but the tanker/tank Dreadnaught.  The end of that race is very cool, and nicely explained in the Bonus Features.  The movie is set in a bleak environment, with alot of greys, blacks, and other dark colors.  The special effects are great in the way the various drivers meet their demise.

  There are 3 items in the Bonus Features.  1) Start Your Engines: Making a Death Race.  Explains the making of Death Race, and how the filmmakers wanted to make a more dark and serious film than Death Race 2000.  2) Behind The Wheel : Dissecting the Stunts.  This feature broked down the filming of the stunts and how they were devised.  As I mentioned earlier, the part on the Dreadnaught was pretty cool.  3) Feature Commentary with Director and Producer.  There are also some trailers of other movies at the beginning of the DVD.

Not having seen the ""rated"" version, I don't know what additional footage was included, but it didn't feel as though bits had been ""slipped in"".

Set in a John Carpenter style future (think Escape from New York), the US economy has collapsed and prisons are all run by corporations, who are, in effect, judge, jury and executioner. Jason Statham is perfect for this minimal-dialogue, lots-of-shooting action flick. The gore was surprisingly tame for an ""unrated"" film and rather reminded me of ""Robocop"".

It was nice to see a more serious actress, Joan Allen, play an evil role. She has the face for it, but it's also nice to see that she doesn't take herself too seriously.

3649451,4,B001ILHY2C,"First I watched the unrated edition and there was nothing on it that seemed out of place and all in all it seemed like a clean enough movie that i would not have a problem with younger moviegoers watching it.

Second, I did not get the memo that Jason Straham is the the new Bruce Willis!  This guy is in every movie I have seen lately.  Which is no problem because he does a great job.  He is sort of the stealth action film star.

Now for the movie.  I expected nothing from it and just hoped that my time would not be wasted.  Instead I got a film that had an intense and exciting opening and kept the pace all the way until the end.  There was enough action to occupy me that I was actually wanting the movie to keep going.

The plot was about average for a movie this packed with action, but essentially the main character was framed for a crime he did not commit just so he could be a feature driver in the Death Race a made for pay tv show.  Of course he has revenge on his mind and that plays out well enough during the movie.

The action here is white-knuckle and virtually non-stop.  A real adrenaline rush this is.  Jason Statham cements his crown as an icon of the action genre.  Statham picks his vehicles well and ""Death Race"" is no exception.  Joan Allen plays against type and scores a ten as the tough-as-nails warden.

It was a good diversion, filled with total nonsense mayhem and testosterone-gone-wild. In other words, this was a typical Jason Statham film! No matter how many of these ultra-macho men he plays, he gets away with it with charm and likability.

Mostly there are nothing but bad folks in here and a lot of ultra-violent scenes, one-after-the-other. You also have other clich prison characters, the kind you see in all prison films since ""The Longest Yard."" Beware of jiggling hand-held camera scenes, if that kind of thing gives you a headache.

Having said that, I admit the film is interesting start-to-finish, the racing scenes terrific, the film effectively manipulative, and overall qualifies as a decent means of entertainment.

Death Race moves along at a very fast pace, which is essental for a popcorn filck; it does not give you time to look at the flaws.  There is a ton of brutal violence and car crashs; with some gore.

The strongest acting is done by two of the supporting cast members; Ian McShane and Joan Allen, but the real stars are the cars and the guns.  It's your basic story of a man wrongly accused and imprisond; who has to fight for his freedom.  The plot is full of cliches; but, is still very fun to watch.  On to the Blu-ray...the picture quility is very good; and, the audio is excellent.  You can hear shell casings falling all around you; and, it has a very powerful sound track.

Well, I was wrong and pleasently surprised that despite its absent-mindedness in terms of such things as character development or logic, Death Race manages to provide the goods in terms of action, spectacle, and excitement.  Jason Statham stars as a framed prisoner forced to participate in the title act; which is watched by millions worldwide.  There really isn't much more to the story other than that, and Statham's mission avenge the death of his wife and escape, but Anderson manages to pack in so much vehicular carnage and chaos that you can't help but take your eyes off the screen.  Statham's brand of machismo is on full display here, and it's as magnetic as ever: there's just something about the guy that you can't help but admire, making him more than worthy of being considered a top-flight action star.  Tyrese Gibson stars as Statham's rival Machine Gun Joe, and there's some other great cast members including Joan Allen as the evil warden, Brotherhood's Jason Clarke as the equally wicked head guard, and the great Ian McShane as Statham's mechanic.

3649460,5,B001ILHY2C,"Jason Statham. The name is synonymous with death-defying car chases, adrenalin-induced action, and his stoic face. Always that stoicism. Another take-down of another bad guy. Hero wins, if Jason Statham's characters can be called heroes.

""Death Race"" is no different. This time the ""bad guy"" is Joan Allen in a role shocking for the character's deep-down, never-fail evil nature. This is a Joan Allen stretched beyond her typical character actor roles. She should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actress.

Statham is set up for killing his wife, a cruel joke considering how much he loves her. The warden (Joan Allen) of the prison in this dystopian, post-apocalyptic world wants a replacement for Frankenstein, the winner of the Death Races for which her prison is notorious. She makes lots of money from selling each race to cable for the entertainment of millions. The original Frankenstein died from injuries. Statham is to replace him. That's why he was set up.

This prison is a dark, dreary world of fierce men intent on harming anyone not in their little insulated prison gangs. Latinos. Blacks. Skinheads. And Jason joins what I call the Solitares who band together for the next death race.

The one unrealistic (isn't it all?) piece of the film is the use of gorgeous female inmates as driving assistants, but their assets do add to the ratings. They dress provocatively. Yeah right! And no riot follows? More power to the warden and the inmates' fear of her.

The race is brutal. Prison life is brutal. Everyone is brutal. People die. Ratings skyrocket. The warden smiles. Yet, Jason Statham is the driving force in the film. The viewer must know that what the warden expects will not happen. Worse. She cannot possibly see the ending. It's great.

Don't miss this riveting vehicle for the machismo talent of Jason Statham and how he wins everything. The statement is not a spoiler because you don't have a clue just what he does or how. It's a must-see dark film for action-adventure, post-apocalyptic movie lovers.",1235260800,,2036,4.956011730205279

In the lead Jason Statham gives the kind of performance, Stallone would've brought to the film if it were re-made ten years ago. Statham is given plenty of choices to get hit, throw punches and deliver one-liners. In the second male lead as Machine Gun Joe, Tyrese pretty much walks through the role. One would expect Tyrese to have a ball with the role, but ironically he seems bored with the role.

The movie doesn't have the soul of the original death race. While the plot is somewhat clever and different...it just doesn't have the humor or the cheesiness of the original.

Once the whiners finish with their laundry list of ""Why I didn't like's"", what we are left with is a reasonably decent remake of the obviously dated but campy Corman original. Corman also had a hand in making this one, as well, so it's no wonder the film comes off the way it does.

I'm not one for Jason Statham (he's just too UGLY), but he does well in action flicks. He plays well off the other principles even for a guy with as sparse dialog as Statham had.

The story is spare as is necessary for action films of this type, but not totally lost amidst the carnage, I think the real stars are the cars. It's one of the few (VERY few) times that guns were bolted to cars in a semi-believable manner. I also liked the nice touch of bringing back David Carradine to reprise his role as the original Frankenstein at the start of the film, even if it was only a voice-over.

There are so many things in this film that cannot be taken seriously by ANY measure, but the film IS exciting. So it doesn't have a story, the characters are two-dimensional, the premise is TOTALLY unbelievable, but hey, the death and destruction are more than just on-par.

The Plot is written to move quick and like the characters pretty blah. so you can predict its every move.

This is a fun action flick that meets all of the criteria laid out above. The action is almost non-stop, and where Roger Corman's original had a fun campy feel to it, this updated version goes straight for the action and blood.

The basic story featured in ""Death Race"" is that in 2012, prisoners are forced to race to the death in hopes of gaining freedom. The race takes place in 3 legs around the prison itself. Each prisoner gets a cool and deadly vehicle to compete with, complete with napalm, machine guns and various other weapons. When the top rated racer, ""Frankenstein"", is taken out of action, the Warden in charge of the game needs a replacement quick. Luckily (or not so luckily?) Jason Stratham's character arrives just in time to don the ""Frankenstein"" mask for the upcoming race.

I wasn't sure if I would like this recent remake (so many 1980's remakes coming out of Hollywood have been so disappointing), but gave it the benefit of the doubt. I am glad I did. I love a great action movie, and ""Death Race"" more than fits the bill.

1. Can we really be expected to believe that someone was able to find out who was a good racer and unemployed out of a population of 300 million? And then send a killer to this man's house who was a prisoner to kill his wife and frame him for it?

2. Can we really be expected to believe that even though the US economy collapsed that something like 70 million people had enough disposable income to pay $250 to watch people kill each other with race cars?

3. OSHA and various arms of the federal government have made life unbearable for people who have to work with chemicals. It is no exaggeration to say that the compliances costs of any  business are more expensive than the capital. And yet there was no government arm to be found anywhere in a business where 5-6 contestants got killed every week.

4. Prisoners in the  USA have been known to sue prisons over serving them crunchy peanut butter. Can we really believe that people lived in the conditions that were in this prison?

Despite its ugly-duckling appearance, ""Death Race"" is a serviceable action flick starring the charismatic and appealingly imperturbable Jason Statham (of ""The Bank Job"" fame).  Short on plot, ""Death Race"" is long on action, the explosive action of racing between souped-up, armor-plated, rocket-mounted, grotesque-looking vehicles.

There's one catch to these races:  They're not about winning, they're about killing the other competitors.  The more racers that are killed, the higher the ratings of the televised matches.  It's an interesting theme, but it seems to lack the necessary acerbic wit to pull it off to complete satisfaction.

3649488,3,B001ILHY2C,"Being a film that I've read Roger Ebert express disgust and disappointment, but at the same time Stephen King names it as one of the year's best, of course, one wouldn't be hard-pressed to become curious what to make out of Paul W.S. Anderson's re-imagining of Roger Corman's ""Death Race 2000"". ""DEATH RACE"" is very loosely based on Corman's cult favorite; the 1975 original was somewhat innovatively exploitive, with its satiric take on bloody violence, which made it fun. Anderson is a good action director, he's good with visuals but it is the skill of storytelling  that still eludes him.

In a future where America's economy had collapsed, the prison system has been privatized and the brutal ""Death Race"" is the new source of entertainment for most Americans. After tough as nails, ex-race car driver, Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is framed for the murder of his wife and goes to prison, Warden Hennessey (Joan Allen) is waiting for him. After the death of a masked ""death race"" four-time winner called ""Frankenstein""(voiced by David Carradine), Ames is forced to masquerade as him and to compete against his fellow prison mates in the bloody race. Armed to the teeth, aided by his pit mates (played by Ian McShane and Frederick Koehler) and his navigator, Case (hottie Natalie Martinez), they must fight if they want to stay alive as Hennessey unleashes the fury of her devilish race track and the wrath of his fellow drivers (such as Tyrese Gibson).

There will always be disappointments when a movie is a remake. This 2008 re-issue exchanges the exploitive satiric atmosphere of the original into something that attempts to deliver the same concept with a straight face which results in a comatose display of emotionless machismo. Anderson's visuals are good, there are nice touches as the race has the usual advances in tech such as the activation of a car's weapons--a car has to run over a ""seal"" on the track to activate/enhance its weapons and defenses. (shades of the video game ""Twisted Metal""?) There's a big killer-rig called ""Dreadnaught"", a huge 16-wheeler with a lot of horsepower and attitude. The cars are quite nice to see, I always get excited with the sound of engines and gunfire. The film is definitely a testosterone-driven affair, but sadly, the quality of the action does not match the execution of its plot elements.

Alright, so we know this is a remake, and we are familiar with its concept--therefore the film offers no surprises. However, when it attempted to sidestep the exploitive, satiric fun of the original the experience proved a little unsatisfying. Anderson's direction is just so predictable and the script is so full of holes. The film takes place on a futuristic world where unemployment is so high and America is falling to pieces, how can Warden Hennessey get more than 75 million viewers to subscribe to pay a hefty price to watch the race? Also, how can Ames become ""flirty"" with his navigator when all he should be thinking about is his daughter (then again Natalie is pretty hot). I'm all about a serious tone, but plot elements and emotional inconsistencies just makes me grind my teeth.

Now the film is an action-laden affair, Anderson does somewhat succeed when it comes to shooting these scenes. Explosions, unreasonable violence, and tricky camerawork is the film's main strength. The colors have that grayish ""hue"" and the camera zooms does provide some thrills and attitude. The musical track to accompany the action adds some emotional ""banging"" and it does fit the mood. I think Anderson should have stuck to the basics of the action and mayhem than to attempt to make a few ""crossed"" commentaries about the public's hunger for mass murder and violence coupled with the finger-pointing at the media to manipulate ratings (""Sex and Violence"" does sell) to make money.

Overall, the film is a hack-eyed affair in terms of the eye-candy visuals, but the plot itself is so boring that it can easily put you to sleep. Double-crosses, set-ups, vengeance, survival and escape to freedom are all predictable elements that has been overdone; while this may not be a bad thing, the film's direction is so uneven and the plot is just so full of its own contradictions. Jason Statham is a good action star and I hope that his agent can find him more note-worthy work such as ""The Bank Job"". The actor exudes coolness and attitude, he should steer clear of movies that may break his career.

""Death Race"" is an affront to the 1975 original, but if you turn off your brain, it may prove a decent diversion. See this when you have nothing else to do or if you haven't seen the original film by Roger Corman.

I mean, like he's so Carpenter, what's bad?, except your sorry expectations. Well, mine were lifted! Better than I hoped for! Stephen King said it was the best movie of '08.

Despite its ugly-duckling appearance, ""Death Race"" is a serviceable action flick starring the charismatic and appealingly imperturbable Jason Statham (of ""The Bank Job"" fame).  Short on plot, ""Death Race"" is long on action, the explosive action of racing between souped-up, armor-plated, rocket-mounted, grotesque-looking vehicles.  Statham's killing machine is an unrecognizable modified V-8 Mustang GT.

There's one catch to these races:  they're not about winning, they're about killing the other competitors.  The more racers that are killed, the higher the ratings of the televised matches.  It's an interesting theme, but it seems to lack the necessary acerbic wit to pull it off to complete satisfaction.

3649494,4,B001ILHY2C,"Roger Corman serves as an executive producer on DEATH RACE, a loose remake of his 1975 futuristic cult classic, DEATH RACE 2000.  In fact, David Carradine, who starred in that earlier film, plays ""Frankenstein"" in the opening sequence of this version.

Jason Statham stars in the 2008 release from Universal Studios Home Entertainment.  He plays a former race car driver who is framed for the murder of his wife, so that he will be sent to the prison where the lucrative, nationally televised ""Death Race"" originates.

Warden Joan Allen offers Statham his freedom if he will participate in the ""kill or be killed"" race.

This picture is grounded much more in reality than the 1975 original, and if you can accept the film's outrageous basic premise, then you will find it to be very entertaining.  The race sequences may be rather gory, but they are extremely well-staged.

Paul W.S. Anderson wrote and directed the movie, which co-stars Tyrese Gibson and Ian McShane.

The DVD features both the theatrical and an unrated version of the picture, with Anderson and producer Jeremy Bolt delivering audio commentary on the unrated one.  There are also two ""Making of"" featurettes.

Of course he isn't guilty, but why someone killed his wife soon becomes apparent when he is asked to race, in prison, as the recently deceased driver (AKA Frankenstein). The Death Races, created, produced and organized by the warden are immensely popular to internet fans, and the person to win the most gains his freedom (ok, a tad unrealistic, but this is a movie).  Anyway, although the plot is rather thin, there are several things to LOVE about this film. There is the incredibly sexy Statham (ok, I know that I have said that several times), a crooked warden and her evil sidekick, a very pretty/sexy woman who rides shotgun with Statham, a funny mechanic, Tyrese (anyone riding with him manages to die), fast cars, explosions, and the general dose of death and destruction. So, would I give this movie an Oscar? No. But would I recommend it for someone looking for a few hours of mindless entertainment? Yes, absolutely.",1230422400,,1029,4.780898876404494
3649497,4,B001ILHY2C,"Ok lets be honest with ourselves, those of us who watched this movie (and saw the previews before hand) knew what this was probably going to be like when we sat down to watch it. What some people won't do however is confess that they actually liked it. The fact is that Death Race is exactly what it was made to be: entertaining.

The plot to this movie is very simple and easy to follow: Man gets framed for murdering his wife, he goes to jail, he gets propositioned from the warden to drive in Death Race to earn his freedom, man finds out warden is behind his framing, lots of driving, explosions, and dying follow suite.

To me, this was a decent movie. Yes the story could have been done better, especially since there were some plot holes that begged to be filled. But with a movie like this, we don't really go for the plot. We go for the really cool racing scenes with the post-apocalyptic looking cars and to see guys like the Reaper get splattered against the hood of Tyreese's car. Tyreese by the way, does a so-so job of being the not so bad ""bad guy"" of the film, which I don't think is much his fault, it was just the role he was given. Ultimately his bad guy role is overshadowed by the Warden anyway. Jason Stathum does his thing; you know, the strong silent guy who kicks butt every three scenes or so.

The bottom line is that this is a great action flick to sit and watch on a dull night. Its fun, has some humor, and best of all, they aren't shy on the blood and gore. There's enough Twisted Metal type carnage to give to the whole family (not literally of course). Don't sleep on it, its worth at LEAST a rental, if not something to own so you can watch every now and then for kicks.

P.S. I really do think this would make a friggin awesome video game. There hasn't been a Twisted Metal styled game in a long time, this could be great if its done right (no RockStar Gaming)",1230422400,,1895,4.212121212121212
3649498,3,B001ILHY2C,"""Death Race""  stars Jason Statham, Joan Allen, Ian McShane, and Tyrese Gibson.  In a place called Terminal Island, in the not-too-distant future, the world's hunger for extreme sports and competitions has grown into reality TV bloodlust.  The most extreme racing competition has emerged and its contestants are murderous prisoners.  The rules of Death Race are simple:  win five events and you're set free.  Lose and your bloody body is shown across the Internet.
 Speedway champ Jensen Ames (Statham), an ex-con framed for the murder of his wife, is forced to put on the mask of the mythical driver Frankenstein, a Death Race crowd favorite who seems impossible to kill.  Ames is given an easy choice by Terminal Island's ruthless Warden Hennessey (Allen): suit up and drive or never see his little girl again.  To claim the prize, Ames must survive contests against the most vicious criminals, including Machine Gun Joe (Gibson).  Trained by his coach (McShane), to drive a Mustang V8 Fastback equipped with two mounted mini-guns, flamethrowers, and napalm, Ames must destroy everything in his path to win the most violent spectator sport on the planet.
 Statham is very good as Ames, Joan Allen cold and menacing as a cartoonish warden, and Ian McShane enjoyable to watch as the head of Ames' pit crew.  But it's the action that takes center stage here, with amazing stunts combined with CGI to produce one thrill after another.  The film is a remake of ""Death Race 2000"" (1975), which starred David Carradine and did not have the benefit of today's technology.
 The Unrated Edition (which also contains the theatrical version) has two features that race car lovers will enjoy: ""Start Your Engines: Making a Death Race"" and ""Behind the Wheel: Dissecting the Stunts.""

3649499,3,B001ILHY2C,Death race is the true definition of an action flick. From beginning to end there is action in almost every scene. Which make the movie very entertaining. The down side is the plot/story is very weak and at time predictable. also Tyrese is a horrible actor in almost every movie I have seen him in and this one is no different. Everyone else in the movie just gave an average level of acting. All in all the movie gets 3 stars strictly for the action/entertainment factor. Don't look for much more beyond that.,1230422400,,510,4.494623655913978
3649500,4,B001ILHY2C,"I'll say it up front that some of my favorite movies are the long, dense and actor-driven films that have come out over the past 40 or so years but you know what? Occasionally I just want to have fun, tear loose and pop in a movie that gets you pumped. Is it badly written? Naturally and in addition to being not particularly depthful or well-characterized people, it's a film that says ""you know what? Grab some buddies, nachos and drinks and just have fun"" with a between-the-lines requirement that you shut off your brain first. Paul W.S. Anderson has in certain respects stopped being the poster child for bad filmmaking since now that the inexplicable ""directing"" by one Uwe Boll has been set loose, we now look at Anderson as the good bad-movie maker and so we have Death Race, a remake of the old Roger Corman film and looking at it you can level all the complaints you want at it but you'd still have a blast anyway.

Set in 2012, the prison system has become home to one of the most popular forms of entertainment on the web, that of the Death Race, a 3 part race where drivers literally fight to the death in hopes that they'll make it to 5 wins and earn their freedom out of prison. Headed by the devious Hennessey and her cronie guard/bodyguard Ulrich, the prison also houses the famous racer, Frankenstein who dons a mask since his face is so disfigured from previous races. But when he dies after a race, in comes Jensen Ames who's been wrongly imprisoned for murdering his wife so Hennessey and Ames cut a deal: with 4 races won by the original Frankenstein, if Ames wins that next race and dons his mask for ratings purposes, Ames goes free but surviving the race is one thing, surviving a warden who isn't exactly going to let her golden goose disappear is another.

Returning to the director's chair 4 years after he made the slightly-average-but-still-disappointing Alien vs. Predator, Anderson returns with Death Race and quite simply if you've ever seen any of his previous movies you know what to expect here and one can say that strangely, it's his best film in awhile. Resident Evil was a fine movie to me however it was not a horror movie and considering its source material, that's a disappointment while AvP was just too tame for the battle royale that it was supposed to be. Death Race is along the lines of say Event Horizon or Mortal Kombat where yeah, it does have issues but honestly, when the film's this fun, I could care less.

That doesn't mean he can't improve and disregarding the usual suggestions of ""make better movies"", he's gotta learn how to properly make an action sequence work since he still does that hyper editing where he tries to out-do Michael Bay in that instead of showing an exciting sequence, they gotta cut it up and make it so frantic and chaotic that it looks exciting, like being on a rollercoaster with your eyes darting all over the place. Then of course there's the writing which is filled with cliche lines or just bad one-liners but look at the movie uncritically and it passes, fixate on minor details and you're practically checking off all the goofy parts.

But enough about that, let's talk about the sexy violence since let's face it, we're dealing with cars outfitted with napalm, smoke, machine guns and when damaged a lot, they explode really nice. The hyperkinetic action is really the highlight for those into this kind of thing and in this area, this makes Anderson's new movie arguably the better one he's made in years. In fact to its detriment strangely since the races are so visually exciting and filled with balls-to-the-wall stunts and action that when they stop to tell stories and have character moments,the film deflates a bit too much. Nice to have a breather sure but here it becomes a bit too slow and doesn't quite have the downtime it needed. Plus this downtime doesn't include Natalie Martinez playing Case, Ames' side driver who fulfills that sexy role very nicely but since she only shows up in the prison the day of the race, you kind of miss looking at her. But we do have Robin Shou from Mortal Kombat in a very small cameo and Ian McShane of Deadwood fame is always awesome so there's that too.

In the end, Death Race is for adrenaline junkies, the kind of people who can watch action movies for the sake of getting your kicks out and Death Race does this. Might not be a lasting movie in the home, but it's a fun one when it's on.",1230336000,,4430,4.546365914786968

I noticed Amazon stopped discounting movies much from the original intro prices you always see on Blu ray of about $26.99-$29.99 once they say their holiday sales were better than most.

The back cover of DVD tells that there is additional 6 min in Unrated version, but there is no any list of what exactly was added.
Here is the list of these additions made by comparing of two versions. Feel free to correct it.

Only significant changes:

1. Scene at the steel mill where the cops come features Jensen egging them on as they attack his fellow coworkers.

2. Cafeteria scene shows the spit actually hitting Jensen's food. Small scene afterward of Ulrich leading Jensen to the Warden's office, telling him that the Warden punishes prisoners ""who mess with her drivers.""

3. The fate of Jensen's cell mates. (You don't actually see anything happen, just sound effects)

4. Small 15 second scene of Case giving details on how the buttons work during the race: ""All four wheels must hit the button at the same time.""

5. The machine guns stop working on the front of the Mustang and Case hangs out the window, hitting them with a wrench as the other cars shoot at her. (Probably the longest scene removed from the theatrical release)

6. A few cuts of Grimm's car interior logrolling before it gets launched into the air.

7. Quick cuts of the napalm flames engulfing Travis Colt before his car blows.

8. When Jensen initially attacks Pachenko, he admits that Hennessey and Ulrich did it, and we see a sort of flashback to him and Ulrich sitting in a car watching Jensen step out of the bus.

9. Case make small talk and asks Jensen what his real name is as the two modified Death Race cars speed across the Terminal Prison bridge.

Nothing really significantly different. A little more extended, but not by much, and nothing really improved upon as far as being more-violent and showing more gore than the theatrical release.",1229904000,35,1886,4.719512195121951

The action scenes are intense, helped by the use of practical effects, rather than CGI overkill. Just wait until you see the tanker truck getting flipped in slow motion. Almost as cool as the semi truck flip in The Dark Knight. Jason Statham is the action star of this decade. The man has muscles everywhere and does the most with his limited acting range. Ian McShane of HBO's Deadwood is given some good lines and is one of the more memorable characters in the movie. I hope he gets more big screen parts in the future. Joan Allen turns in performance I could have never pictured her doing before today, and it worked.

Death race will likely give you a headache with it's shaky camera movements and some of the dialogue could have used some work, but I had a great time. If your of the male gender, the cars, guns, explosions and babes will keep you entertained.

3649512,4,B001ILHY2C,"DEATH RACE basically revolves around a reality show in which inmates of the world's most dangerous prison race heavily modified and heavily armed vehicles on a track. There are no rules and the object of the race is to be the last person alive. If a prisoner wins five Death Races, he's a free man. Jason Statham plays a prisoner who is given the task of portraying a character named Frankenstein, a masked and disfigured racer who was killed on the track by another prisoner named Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson). However, because Frankenstein was a huge ratings draw his death was covered up and played off as just an injury. So all Jason Statham has to do is don Frankenstein's mask and keep the legend of the character alive. There are a few twists involving why he's in prison and why he's the person chosen to play Frankenstein, but you'll find it all out when you watch the movie... or read the back of the freakin DVD cover.

This movie is not very similar at all to the original ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Race/dp/B000B8QFZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Race</a>"". In the original movie, the Death Race was a game in which drivers hit random pedestrians and accumulated points based on their victim's age, gender, disability, so on and so forth. A pretty awesome idea for a movie if you ask me! The only thing similar with the new DEATH RACE are the characters of Frankenstein and Machine Gun Joe. When I heard about how much changes were going to be made with this new movie I was pretty disappointed and didn't have any desire to see it whatsoever. And it doesn't help that I'm not the biggest Jason Statham fan. However, with a DVD release I thought I would give this movie a shot and I'm actually pretty glad I did. The plot isn't as dumb as I thought it would be and actually came off quite well. The actual script is pretty dumb and is a little too&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/fast-and-furious/dp/B00008MZ0N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">fast and furious</a>&nbsp;for my taste, but the overall movie is well done. The pace is extremlely fast and the Unrated version which is almost two hours, went by very quickly. There was never a dull moment in this film.

The whole movie definitely has a Post-Apocalyptic vibe to it even though it only takes place in 2012. From the look of the prison to the look of the vehicles, there is a slight MAD MAX feel to it, but for the most part it stays with the times. The cars in the movie are pretty impressive, especially a monstrosity of a vehicle called the Dreadnought which acts as an obstacle in the race. It's like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mechagodzilla/dp/B00006FD9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mechagodzilla</a>&nbsp;on wheels. The theatrical version of this film is rated R, but surprisingly there isn't a whole lot of gore in the movie. One person gets obliterated by a vehicle in borderline ROBOCOP fashion but that's about it.

If you can suspend your disbelief and not take DEATH RACE too seriously, you'll probably enjoy it. Normally, I hate most big budget Action movies that are heavy on the special effects, but I was really surprised by how awesome DEATH RACE is. There were a few things I absolutely hated about it though. The main thing was the script and the dialogue, but coming from Paul W.S. Anderson, I should have had low expectations. More often than not, DEATH RACE delves into FAST AND THE FURIOUS territory thanks to the lead female character in the film who is basically Frankenstein's assistant. An extremely hot woman in the world's most dangerous prison that's made up of all MEN?? Yeah... OK. I'm all for suspending one's disbelief but there are a few things I can't get over and DEATH RACE pushes the envelope as far as that's concerned. I could go off on a rant about how pea brained the script is, but I won't. The action sequences and the characters more than make up for it. The bottom line is on an entertainment level, DEATH RACE is easily a five star movie. If I were to rate this movie on an intelligence level, then it would probably be a two star movie. As an overall package, which is essentially an Action film, it more than delivers. If you're looking for a fun movie then you won't be disappointed with this one.

3649514,5,B001ILHY2C,"After watching ""Death Race"" with Jason Statham and Tyrese Gibson, I had to take a long breath.

""Death Race"" is a remake of the original Roger Corman film from 1973 that is still fondly remembered and is considered a cult classic.  Once you see this version, you will promptly forget Carradine and remember Jason Statham for a long time.

This is truly an action film.  There are races based on speed, based on weaponry, and perils that are orchestrated by the prion matron/action director of a live Terminal Island race to the death seen around the world.  Talk about the ultimate reality show!  Forget being voted off the island, or voted off Idol.  Try surviving the armored speed vehicle assault squad.  Fire, oil, nails, napalm, and falling metal are only some of their favorite things.

The wrongly convicted Jensen Ames, aka Frankenstein, is driving for his life against mass murderers and felons.  Death has no meaning except for a way to advance to freedom.  His co-operation has been assured by the blackmail of Hennessey and the location of his daughter.  The race is only part of the appeal of this film.

Surprisingly, behind the violence and tough language, a great film lives.  There is drama, compassion, and a fight for freedom amidst the most dangerous of circumstances.  Yep, only a cable TV audience can inspire the severely twisted!

The stunts are terrific.  The special effects explosive.  And the cast is perfect.  No pretty boys here.

The special features include 'Start Your Engines', 'Behind the Wheel', 'Stunts' and a commentary.  My version includes both the rated and unrated versions.

Don't expect your kids to drive like this!

3649515,3,B001ILHY2C,"I know this is a remake of Paul Bartel's cult classic ""Death Race 2000"" from 1975, but Paul W.S. Anderson's ""Death Race"" (2008) looks more like a cross between Mel Gibson's ""Mad Max 2"" and Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""The Running Man."" With lots of actions and plot holes, ""Death Race"" only wants to entertain us. Though the film still has room for improvement, especially the way it wraps up the story, I liked the film for what it is, pure entertainment.

The time is set in 2012. Jason Statham plays a retired ace racer Jensen Ames, wrongly accused of murder. He is sent to ""Terminal Island,"" the worst kind of jail controlled by a cold-blooded, money-hungry warden Hennessey (very icy Joan Allen). There, disguised as the star racer ""Frankenstein,"" Jensen joins the survival games staged as a hugely popular online show.

Despite its weak (and sometimes very silly) plot, ""Death Race"" delivers nice car stunts, some of which are clearly inspired by the climax car chase of ""Mad Max 2."" The racing scenes are the greatest merit of the film, but I think with less hectic pace and erratic editing the racing footage could have been better. On the acting side, Jason Statham turns in a decent performance as the hero and you can enjoy watching (delightfully, I hope) over-the-top acting from Joan Allen, who delivers one of the most memorable lines of the year. Don't miss it.",1229558400,,1372,4.784810126582278

3649517,5,B001ILHY2C,"The movie focuses on the Terminal Island Prison, which broadcast ""Death Race"" to the world via a popular paysite on internet. Death Race is not only a race to the finish line, but a battle pitting car against car.
Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is framed for his wife's murder on the same day that the steel mill he works at closes; the murderer is actually a masked intruder that points a finger-gun at Ames as he leaves. Ames is sent to prison where he is coerced by the sadistic prison warden, Hennessey (Joan Allen) to become the new driver of Frankenstein's Ford Mustang. She tells Ames that she knows of his baby that was left in foster care, and that prisoners are freed upon winning five Death Races, but since he will take on the mask of the legendary Frankenstein, who had 4 wins at the time of his death, he will only need to win one race. The races are broken apart into three stages: Stage 1 and 2 are races in which the driver must survive, and Stage 3 you must win the race in order for it to add to the count towards freedom.",1228348800,3,1038,4.274111675126903
3649518,5,B001ILHY2C,"Fast cars, violence, pretty girls, and Jason Statham shirtless, what more could you want? So Jason (Jensen) is framed for the murder of his wife and ends up in this prison. In the future entertainment is watching inmates race to the death. Jensen is told if he wins 1 race, he is free to go, violence ensues.",1226188800,,308,4.421052631578948
3649519,4,B001ILHY2C,"The plot of ""Death Race"" goes something like this: former NASCAR champion Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is wrongfully convicted of the murder of his wife and sent to Terminal Island prison, where he is given the opportunity to compete in the Death Race, a car race to the death, with the prize being his freedom. Not that the plot really matters, because this isn't the sort of film that you would go to in the hope of finding a movie with a complex plot, sparkling dialogue and brilliant acting. If you are contemplating seeing this film, it's because you want to see the cars and the carnage (either than or because you have the perverse desire to hear Joan Allen swear) and this film does not disappoint on any count.

The set-up on the film is a little bit slow, but once the Death Race begins, the film is basically just solid car races from them until the end and the car races are really great. I am not a petrol-head and would not watch a regular car racing movie, but even I felt excited by these scenes. They are an intense blend of high speed racing, ultra-violence and black humour, with enough variety so that you don't feel as though you're watching the same thing again and again.

The film is written and directed by ""that notorious action-hack"" Paul W.S. Anderson, director of ""Alien vs Predator"", whom, in the past, I have heard referred to as the high budget equivalent to Uwe Boll. However, he does a surprisingly good job of the film. Much better than with ""AvP"". Sure it's derivative (think ""The Running Man"" or ""The Condemned"", but with cars), and I'm not certain as to whether this film would hold up too well to a second viewing, but Anderson brings enough new material to the project to make it worthwhile.

As for the acting, Jason Statham, who seems to be shaping up to be the next Arnold Schwarzenegger, plays exactly the same character that he has played in every other film he has appeared in, but hey, I like Jason Statham films so I'm not complaining. His performance, however, is bolstered by those of Ian McShane as the leader of Statham's pit crew, and Joan Allen as the prison's warden. Allen, in particular, is really great in a role that is delightfully out of character, and yeah, the scene in which she lets lose and swears is worth the price of admission. And if you stay until the end of the credits, you can hear her swear again, just in case you missed it the first time.",1225584000,,2414,4.4818181818181815

1. By 2012 the US Economy is completely ruined (guess it doesn't matter who you vote for)
2. Prisons are packed thanks to spiraling unemployment and crime
3. Private corporations run the prisons for profit (Serious business, as there's no money left for a bail-out)
4. Terminal Island Prison runs pay-per-view death races as a fund raiser, using inmates to drive cars tricked out with weapons and armor plating
5. There are no rules except if Warden Hennessey (Joan Allen) says there are
6. Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is framed for the death of his wife
7. Hennessey makes him an offer he can't refuse
8. He becomes a man in an iron mask, with a killer car (literally), a female navigator (to boost PPV ratings) and a pit crew led by scene stealing Ian McShane.
9. Lots of stunt driving, shooting of big guns and explosions follow, although you really can't tell who's shooting at whom for most of it
10. People die

Typical shoot `em up action movie involving high speed racing in armored cars and lots of bad guys, but with plot holes bigger than those left by the armor-piercing RPG Model 7's.

Statham plays his usual tough guy ""Transporter"" role, and Tyrese Gibson does everything but sing the Coca Cola jingle as arch rival Machine Gun Joe.  They throw in a little inspirational family story to soften it up a little, and a teensy tiny little budding romance with dialogue like:

Jensen Ames: [while driving] Get on my lap.
Case: What?
Jensen Ames: Get on my lap!

Recommended for Statham fans and action movie buffs, but I can't see this one going down as a classic for all time.

Jensen Ames: [to Hennessey] You wanted a monster? Well, you've got one.

In Death Race, Jason Statham stars as Jensen, a factory worker who has just finished hs last day at work. He comes home to his beautiful wife and baby, whom he loves very much and would do anything for. But when a killer bursts into his house one night and kills his wife, the police confuse him for the killer, and is sent to jail. In order to get out, Hennessy, the warden of the prison gives him a chance: DEATH RACE, a deadly car race where if you want out, you have to win five races. He accepts, and enters the game, finding himself at competition against other criminals such as 14K and Machine Gun Joe. However, when he discovers that the killer is in the same prison as he, he makes him the number one target during the race!

3649524,1,B001ILHY2C,"Today on ""Death Race"", the final leg of the race to determine which actor has made the worst mistake in their career.

If you're just tuning in, Hollywood is so bankrupt for ideas to make into movies, to keep the distribution pipeline flowing, they have begun to remake a number of films from the 60s and 70s. Some of these original films are questionable to begin with, but studio executives, producers and directors believe that if they throw modern special effects and a lot of money at ideas that were just okay to begin with, they will be able to remake the film. The new film will be bigger, stronger and faster. Could it start a franchise? Let's hope so, because these studios need some films to fill theaters, to create publicity for the DVD release, fueling the PPV run, which will in turn be great for the cable and television windows.

This is the reason Universal Studios decided to green light ""Death Race"", the 'new' film from writer and director Paul W.S. Anderson, the man behind ""Mortal Kombat"", ""Resident Evil"", ""Event Horizon"" and ""AVP: Alien Vs. Predator"". (Notice the preponderance of films based on video games.) Based on a Roger Corman film, the writer-director has moved the story forward a few years and upped the action ante by making the violence more extreme and cartoon-like, more violent and more video game like.

In the first stage of ""Death Race"", we learn all about the future. It is 2012 and America's economy has collapsed. Crime is on the rise and America's prisons are now run by corporations for profit. On Terminal Island, the warden (Joan Allen. Friggin' Joan Allen is in this piece of crap? More on that later) has come up with the idea of the Death Race, a pay-per-view event allowing people to watch prisoners race souped up cars through an obstacle course. Any prisoner that wins five races wins their freedom. Everyone else? They die. But of course, no one has won five races yet. Hennessey (that's the warden's name and because she only has a last name and also has a sidekick sadistic guard who does her bidding, you know she's going to be one tough customer) decides to up the viewer ship by pitting a former racecar driver, Jensen Ames (Jason Statham, ""The Bank Job"", ""The Transporter""), who has just arrived at her prison, against her rogues gallery of drivers. He is serving time for killing his wife and reluctantly agrees to participate against a rogue's gallery of drivers, including Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson). He adopts the pit crew of the driver he is replacing (he died) and Coach (Ian McShane) and his co-horts try to help Jensen win the race. But Jensen begins to put two and two together and begins to realize he might never win the race, despite the warden's assurances. So he takes matters into his own hands.

In Stage Two of ""Death Race"", viewer ship is up by millions as Jensen and the rest of the drivers drove through the course, at breakneck speeds, driving over markers in the road granting them special weapons like 'bullets' and 'napalm' (there's the video game element Anderson seems to crave). They want to get there first, and start using the weapons for defense. If they don't, the weapons will be turned on them.

Much like the other rounds, viewers increase as drivers are killed and get in accidents leaving only a few drivers for each round. But in Stage Three, the final stage, the number of viewers plummets as Universal Studios realizes how few people are interested in watching this piece of drivel. And the actors soon realize what a mistake it was too appear in such a film. Sure, some actors will benefit from any exposure; Natalie Martinez who plays Case, Jensen's navigator, could only benefit; this is her first film, following some television work. She is pretty and the character walks around in skimpy t-shirts and daisy dukes. I'm sure this is regulation wear any time someone gets into a racecar, but that seems irrelevant to the filmmakers. And Jason Statham is the star. No one really expects a Jason Statham film to be memorable for anything other than the over choreographed action scenes. When he makes a film like ""The Bank Job"", it is a complete surprise to everyone, including the actor himself, that anything with his name attached could be that good. So, their careers won't be damaged by their appearance in ""Death Race"".

For Stage Three, we have two contenders left. The well respected, critically acclaimed, Oscar nominated Joan Allen will battle it out with Ian McShane, the once promising British actor. The winner will have their participation in this film crowned the ""Biggest Blunder of their Career"".

First, let's consider the case of Ian McShane. McShane helped to create the very memorable Al Swearengen in HBO's ""Deadwood"". Before and since the show ended, he has appeared in a number of promising films, but he seems destined to be a character actor. None of his film work has sent the world a buzzing. Perhaps the most interesting choice he has made was to appear in Woody Allen's ""Scoop"". This is the writer- director's second London-based film, the non-""Matchpoint"" film. In short, ""Scoop"" is a terrible film starring Scarlett Johansson, Hugh Jackman, McShane and Woody Allen. Johansson and Allen team up to uncover whether Jackman's character is a killer. But Johansson becomes attracted to the dashing Jackman while Allen does his shtick as her sidekick. McShane plays a ghost, one of the killer's victims. So the film is pretty bad, but McShane's small role is interesting. McShane also had a small part in ""The Golden Compass"", but that film flopped. His best film work to date has been his voice work for ""Kung Fu Panda"", creating the character Tai Lung, a fearsome white tiger. His work helps make Tai Lung one of the best-animated villains to come along in a long time. His other film work is pretty forgettable.

So, it almost seems acceptable for McShane to appear in ""Death Race"". He is a character actor and his appearance helps to make him more recognizable. The next time the ten people who saw ""Death Race"" see him, they'll go ""Oh, he played 'Coach' in ""Race to the Death"""". Hopefully, they will be watching a better film the next time they see him on the silver screen.

Joan Allen has been nominated for two Academy Awards. Joan Allen should stay far away from films like ""Death Race"". After her appearances in films like ""The Bourne Trilogy"", ""The Ice Storm"", ""The Crucible"" and ""Pleasantville"" among others, she should have two types of films being offered to her on a regular basis. Great female roles and even better female roles. She can play tough women (Pamela Lundy in ""The Bourne"" films), unhappy housewives (""The Ice Storm"" and ""Pleasantville""), a very bitter divorcee (""The Upside of Anger""), Pat Nixon (""Nixon"") and more. She has range.

I am unsure why or how she ended up in ""Death Race"". If it was her agent's advice, she needs a new agent. If she wanted to take the role, for a change of pace, to play a tough woman, she has played tough women before. The role can't be that much of a stretch. I know every actor looks for new challenges, especially when you are as talented as Allen is in her craft, but taking on a role of this caliber is simply below her. I know every actress wants to have the ""Ripley"" (Sigourney Weaver in the ""Alien"" films) role on her resume, but Hennessey is no Ripley, so it doesn't add anything to her career. Allen should follow the example of Meryl Streep. Critically acclaimed, Streep seems to garner Oscar nominations as quickly as she makes films. But the films she earns these nominations for are extremely serious, weighty films. ""Sophie's Choice"", ""Out of Africa"", ""Kramer Vs. Kramer"", ""Silkwood"". Streep has taken on a diverse group of roles beyond this, to provide challenges for herself and to broaden her repertoire. Everything from comedy (""She-Devil"", ""The Devil Wears Prada"") to kid's films (""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"") to musicals (""Mamma Mia!""). Sure, there have been some misses in Streep's career, but her track record is very high. Streep has range and has an incredible track record choosing the right projects with the right writers and directors attached, the right co-stars, the right subject matter.

Allen could have the same career. She has started to build the same sort of resume and reputation. But if she chooses too many films like ""Death Race"", takes too many large paychecks for the wrong films, her career will be affected. She might find herself playing character roles instead of leading roles. She might find herself taking more and more films with directors attached who are best known for adapting video games to the silver screen. She might find her next co-star is Vin Diesel or Jason Statham.

Oh, wait a minute... Right...

So at the send of stage three, we find the winner of ""Death Race"" is Joan Allen. And the winner is, in fact, the loser.",1219968000,6,8898,4.766385463984426
3649525,1,B001ILHY2C,"Judging from the reviews here, I've come to two decisions.  The first is that we must have seen a different movie.  The second is that...this review probably isn't going to popular.  Neither of which I can really do anything to solve, so here we go...

Death Race can't qualify as anything other than a guilty pleasure.  And Paul W.S. Anderson is the go-to guy for that kind of flick, what with his constantly panned movies that include AVP, Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat, etc.  His movies are also consistenly deemed ""like watching a video game,"" a critique I've never really took seriously, being an avid gamer myself.  But Death Race is like watching a video game...except it's one that's not thrilling, not interactive and just plain dumb.

Billed as a being based on the 1970s Grindhouse flick Death Race 2000, this version is all about a ""not-too-far-in-the-future"" future state of America, where the economy has collapsed and mega-corporations own everything, including the prisons.  And of course, since we all know that corporations want to make money, Death Race, a TV show that's pulled from our apparent desire to watch other people and the olden gladiator/chariot races, is born.  Pitting inmates against each other with the gleam of being released if they win enough, Death Race sounds, if not promising then at least interesting on paper.  But it's the execution that kills.

Paper thin characters I can forgive.  A lame plot with even lamer ""twists"" that everyone knows are coming either intuitively or by watching the trailers, is also forgivable.  I can even almost forgive the portrayal of females being either frigid ice queens or sexually-charged navigators whose only real purpose is to look ""hawt.""  I mean, when we're talking about a guilty pleasure aimed at young men, it's to be expected.  But when the flick isn't even entertaining in the least, then, NASA, we have a problem.

With the ""race"" consisting of stages (*ahemvideogames*) and even a boss battle tossed in during the second race, Death Race feels like a lame version of Twisted Metal, minus the cool characters, the exciting matches and, well, the fun factor.  In the end, Death Race had me looking at my watch, waiting for something to happen...and then something did happen: the credits rolled.  And I wished I had gone to see Tropic Thunder again.",1219881600,12,2337,4.946153846153846
3649526,2,B001ILHY2C,"Explosively loud and expectedly crazy, 2008's Death Race bears the distinct marks of director Paul W.S. Anderson's trademark fast action and brutal violence, but a heavy focus on visuals can't overcome an extremely predictable storyline - one that unfortunately loses most of the magic of Corman's original. While an interesting commentary on America's infatuation with violence lies buried beneath all the metal and mayhem, what's clearly exposed is a less interactive, R-rated Mario Kart for adults.

The year 2012 finds the United States' economy collapsed, unemployment off the charts, and prisons filled to capacity. Greedy corporations control the system and stage live competitions to the death for entertainment. In the ever-present bid for more riotously violent spectacles, notorious female warden Hennessey (Joan Allen) creates Death Race, a three-part car-race for freedom where the only rule is to stay alive. When Frankenstein, the most infamous Death Race combatant, dies shortly after a race, Hennessey frames driver Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) for murder and blackmails him into participating in the latest deathmatch under the guise of the deceased racer. Realizing he's trapped, Ames agrees to race, but with the help of his dedicated crew of mechanics and his navigator Case (Natalie Martinez), he might just be able to find a way out - and exact a little revenge on those who wronged him.

Jason Statham seems to be the go-to guy for silly action movies, and while he's certainly not as charismatic as some of his action-movie predecessors, he does get the job done. In Death Race he's appropriately stone-faced and serious, and with a touch of camaraderie and even a little humor, he creates an antihero that's easy to root for. Which is good because there's little else to cheer for other than the violent and over-the-top death sequences. Ames' competition is littered with stereotypes of very angry men fueled by hatred and a general distaste for life. Tyrese Gibson portrays a noticeably unintimidating antagonist, one whose menace is relegated to mediocre taunts and whose sexuality seems to be constantly under question. All the rest are merely obstacles, as lifeless as the bullets and juggernaut tanks that hinder our hero's progress. Except for Joan Allen's Hennessey, who is so annoyingly cocky and overwrought with forced aggression that to see her get what's coming to her is barely compensation for her copious screentime.

The very idea of a B-movie has been dragged out of Death Race and fattened up - to the point that it is anything but second grade material. Convincing special effects, high definition detonations, and top quality set designs are but a few of the aspects that are too good to be bad. Unlike the original film, which rose from its low-budget status to become a cult classic (chiefly due to its unusually fun themes of anarchy and nihilism), this new Death Race tries too hard to go for specific audience reactions. While director Paul W.S. Anderson force-feeds us the moments that he wants to be perceived as ultra hip, the more entertaining subtleties are likely to be ignored. As we're tantalized by the shapely Natalie Martinez swaying in slow motion, an interesting stolen idea from The Shawshank Redemption might be overlooked. Then again, maybe we're better off.

Like some twisted hybrid reality TV show abomination of BattleBots, The Fast and the Furious and The Shawshank Redemption, the new Death Race is unspeakably cheesy. But crowned with Roger Corman's own producer credit, it is perhaps appropriately nonsensical. Begging to be the ultimate ""guy movie"" with slow-motion scantily-clad girls, violent bloody action, explosions, heavy artillery and fast armored cars, it is also itching to be ridiculed. From hilariously peaked dialogue to the safety warning at the end credits (asking the easily impressionable to refrain from stunt car driving), Death Race can't and shouldn't be taken seriously.

As long as you know and like the premise of the movie, you will like this.  It's a dark revenge movie with death for nearly everyone.",1219708800,,333,4.559322033898305
