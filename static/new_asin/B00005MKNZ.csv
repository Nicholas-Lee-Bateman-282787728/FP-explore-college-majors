Literally the funniest thing I have seen. It is subtitled so you have to read and some of the translations are a little off since some of it uses slang terms.

SPOILERS

Absolute gems to look out for:
-the dog that somehow changes its bark to a dinosaur roar
-the guys juggling while STANDING ON SOMEONE'S HEAD
-you may be laughing too hard to hear this, but after Wolf and Kai fight to the death and go tumbling over the edge, Brit decides to jump to her doom as well and utters a tiny little grunt sound thing that will make you laugh all the harder.

Fantastic film, good for learning how to count in German also, they do it constantly.",1510790400,,796,4.223684210526316
7945914,4,B00005MKNZ,"Say what you like about those Godless Commies, they sure could make a snappy romantic musical comedy!

Look, guys, let's face it. There are very, very few (maybe about three) truly good musical films made outside of Hollywood. And to be perfectly honest, this isn't one of them. But then again, if you were looking for something to rival the Wizard of Oz or West Side Story, you wouldn't turn to East Germany's official propaganda machine to find it, would you? Of course not.

But if you're looking for some harmless kitschy fun, if you have a generous spirit that can overlook the myriad shortcomings resulting from the overwhelming challenges Joachim Hasler and his colleagues had to contend with, or if you are a sheltered eleven-year-old girl who just can't wait to be a teenager, then Hot Summer hits the spot.

This cute road trip picture concerns twenty East Berlin teens who hitchhike their way to the Baltic looking for some respite from the blistering heat of the big city. It was filmed on location in 1968, featuring East Germany's two biggest rock and roll stars (Frank Sch&ouml;bel and Chris Doerk). Westerners had long been used to seeing their teen idols frolicking on the big screen, but behind the iron curtain, such an idea was brand new and terribly exciting. Hot Summer was wildly popular and inspired many kids to take their own parent-free vacations in real life.

The plot is thin and the action often silly (what do you want? At that time, this was the norm, even in Hollywood) and as for the ""dance"" numbers, well, let's just say sometimes a viewer aches for the actors who were subjected to such embarrassing choreography. But the players make the most of what they're given, throwing their hearts into every second of the movie. And being young, they're all gorgeous and fun to watch.

Hot Summer offers more than enough innocent charm to make up for its flaws. If you set realistic expectations, I'm sure you'll find Hot Summer as enjoyable as a picnic in July.",1341619200,,1991,4.742774566473988
7945915,5,B00005MKNZ,"I had the pleasure of watching this with my eight year old who was completely befuddled by the simplistic plot, but did notice all the stiff dance moves, odd camera angles, and wide-eyed acting. A fun romp into the minds of sheltered Germany and their idea of a teen vacation romp. Fun to watch for kitsch and dang entertaining!",1171152000,2,328,4.576271186440678
7945916,3,B00005MKNZ,"Who would have thought a beach party movie from the Red Menace of East Germany would be more wholesome than any of the American competition?  A big group of young men and a big group of young women bump into each other while hitchhiking to the Baltic coast for summer vacation, and play increasingly juvenile pranks on one another.  They sing songs (""Heisse Sommer"" will burn its way into your brain whether you speak German or not), dance with awful awkwardness to choreography that is based almost entirely on marching, and maintain solemn chastity while building socialism.  At the end, the movie just kind of peters out.  It's still a fascinating glimpse into Soviet-era Eastern Europe.

In one of the bonus materials, a short essay explains that this movie was really popular among the youth when it was released, and the kids would go see this repeatedly.  I guess there really wasn't much to do in communist-era East Germany.",1125964800,,932,4.830188679245283
7945917,4,B00005MKNZ,"This movie is great! Obviously inspired by American beach movies of the sixties, I think it out-performs them. I don't care much for the ending, but I guess in the end the two who are still together kinda deserve each other.

Loved the music!",1110067200,,242,4.5
7945918,4,B00005MKNZ,"Maybe you've seen ""Beach Party,"" or ""Beach Blanket Bingo,"" but I'll bet you've never seen an East German beach party musical -so welcome to Heisser Sommer!  DEFA (the East German Communist government-controlled film company) did not make many musicals.  Indeed, given the chronic shortages in East Germany  (often filmmaking would have to stop when the electricity went off), and the limited ability of filmmakers, actors and the like to interact with their western counterparts, it is remarkable that this film is as good as it is. It is easily as good as any American movie of this genre, and you'll find yourself humming the tunes long after the movie is over.

The plot is simplistic: a group of ten teenage boys and a separate group of eleven teenage girls make their way to the Baltic Sea for a vacation.  After they arrive, each group engages collectively in sophomoric hi-jinks (e.g., the boys hide the girls' clothes while the girls are swimming; the girls send the boys to a barn ""guarded"" by a St. Bernard) and one girl plays two boys off against each other.  While the dancing, by Western standards, is a bit amateurish, the songs are catchy, the singing is good and the film is fast-paced and energetic.

When watching the movie, though, you will never forget that it's in East Germany.  For openers, the female lead does not look like a typical 1960s-era American leading lady.  The movie offers a rare glimpse of 1960s East Germany (Leipzig, in the opening; East Berlin, in a dream sequence.)  Some of the translations, while accurate, are unintentionally funny.  As others have mentioned, communist mores, while incidental to the plot, occasionally come through.  Example:  when one guy wants to leave early, he is told that ""only cowards leave.""  This echoes the view held by the East German government that those who went West were cowards, who did not want to participate in building the ""workers' paradise.""  The movie makes it appear as if groups of kids could take off for vacations almost on a whim -- as the commentary on the film explains, vacations in East Germany involved a lot of advance planning.

The movie is a lot of fun.  If you enjoy it, you'll also like ""East Side Story,"" which is a tongue-in-cheek history of musicals made behind the Iron Curtain.",1104969600,5,2285,4.817948717948718
7945919,4,B00005MKNZ,"While not a world class musical, ""Hot Summer"" was certainly in the league of its contemporary American models. If you've seen the documentary about communist bloc musicals, ""East Side Story,"" you know that because of the communist system DEFA made very few musical comedies, so it's amazing that this film is as good and polished as it is. The director was talented and several of the actor/singers are very charismatic and likely would have done well in the West. In some ways the characters were more mature than their counterparts in Hollywood beach movies. For example, one character discusses the possibility of pregnancy.
Still, this is a fun film. I hope Ice Storm International and First Run Features will bring out DEFA's ""Midnight Revue"" and ""No Cheating Darling;"" I think they'd do well.",1051401600,,798,5.007518796992481
7945920,5,B00005MKNZ,"I would agree with everything the last reviewer said abotu this film EXCEPT for the political part. This film was made by DEFA, the East German state run film company. While on the surface it does seem like an innocent film about prank playing teenagers at a beach on summer vacation, I believe there is a subtext of conformaity and a celebration of East German industry.
 The group of 10 guys and 11 girls can almost be seen as one person. They are almsot identical to each other...a theme even more reinforced by the scripted dance scenes. When one of them breaks from the group to be with a girl, it is up to the group to ""save him"" from himself (quoted quite nicely in the line, ""Are we a group? Or a common bunch of thugs""..sorry something to that effect I don't have my tape with me to refrence the line).
  Also apperaing throughout the film are symbols of East German industry...farming, fishing..and to top it off quite nicely a shot of speeding train wheels (along with the train) that Eistenstein himself would be proud to see.
  Also to note while most DEFA films (Traces of Stone, Berlin Sholhazen? corner) portrays the EG police as no better then the STASI (secret police) here we have accepting, almost sympathetic police officers who help the kids out of a jam.
  Overall though a very fun viewing on many diferent levels.",1011571200,,1338,4.573221757322176
7945921,5,B00005MKNZ,"Here's an unexpected delight, an East German Rock n' Roll musical!  I kid you not!  I can't begin to describe what a delight this film is.  The tunes are catchy, the leads engaging and there's not a hint of politics to be found anywhere in the film (apparently made be so innocuous that there'd be no way to ban it).  Most importantly, however, is that there's a pretty good energy to the filmmaking and the musical numbers (which are numerous, BTW).  It's an incredibly pleasant film experience that also has a bit of camp value thrown in for good measure.  It's very much not unlike a BEACH PARTY film except it's not as sitcom-like as those (no offense, Wiiliam Asher) and there's no Eric Von Zip.  You may have seen clips from the film if you saw EAST SIDE STORY, the 1997 documentary on Commie musicals, but you gotta see the whole thing to really get the idea.  When you see it you'll have yourself a real good time.  Summer ain't over yet until HOT SUMMER plays in your home.",994291200,7,982,4.411111111111111
