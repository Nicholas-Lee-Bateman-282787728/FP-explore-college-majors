Just when you think there can't be anymore secrets left, another movie comes out absolutely filled with great information! Not too give anything away, but the information about the eye will blow you away!",1299628800,,309,5.078431372549019
8520308,5,B004EGW80Q,"While researching pigeons, I discovered the series of films that Jim Jenner has created on the sport of pigeon racing. I found his films to be extremely entertaining and educational, and it is obvious that Mr. Jenner speaks not only from his life-long passion for the sport but also from his desire to keep this sport alive and growing today (what a great activity for kids!).
Each film provides the viewer, whether a novice or a seasoned sportsman, with unique insight into the behind-the-scenes expertise of pigeon racing. You will be impressed by Mr. Jenner's knowledge and experience as well as his photography. I highly recommend this series of films.",1299369600,,656,4.972727272727273
