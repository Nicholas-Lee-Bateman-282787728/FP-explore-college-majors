612941,5,6303257313,"This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Jack Lemmon was a VERY funny comic actor in the 50's and 60's.  This is one of his better roles.  The movie has a classic 60's retro feel to it: colorful, clever plot, funny  supporting characters.  Why oh why can't they make movies like this  anymore???",941068800,12,305,4.375

613099,4,6303257313,"A genial, entertaining comedy from the early '60s about an advertising man and a neighbor with inheritance problems.  The slapstick will not appeal to everyone, but it's a great opportunity to see Jack Lemmon, Dorothy Provine and Edward G. Robinson, among other Hollywood luminaries of the past.",1469232000,,295,5.276595744680851

613163,5,6303257313,"Hilarious old fashioned screwball comedy of 1964 filmed in San francisco and los
Angeles.  The famous Romy Schneider, who played The Emperess of Austria in the German film Sissy, is here a European old friend of Minerva, Min, for short, housewife and mother of two girls to an advertising Art man.  And that is Jack Lemmon, six years a low man in the totem pole, commuting over the Golden Gate Bridge to downtown Frisco every day, feeling like a sheep, who wants to break free.

One plot turn after another throws Young Jack Lemmon into deeper and deeper trouble as he begins to play a live -in husband for the European friend.  She is divorced but could lose a $15 million inheritance if she doesn't stay married so our Good Neighbor Sam naturally obliges.  He moves into her place next door, which she has just rented.  Otherwise the private detective will figure out she is single and poof! Goes that money!

I loved the first half of the film poking fun at the advertising world and the men who run it.  They are so obsequious to the clients and so full of themselves with their female assistants squealing and gushing in appropriate 1960's bright colors and dresses and skirts.  It is almost Madmen!  And brings to mind the book by Peter Mayle called ""Up the Agency"".

Naturally this director Alfrich also did ""How to Succeed in Business"", so if you enjoy humor about the business world and its men in suits, this first half will delight you.

The suburban scene in a round cul de sac was filmed in Los Angeles.  People drive a lot of convertibles even to work.  That is NOT San Francisco!  Even Bissel's mother in law picks up the grandkids in a Stingray convertible.

The men are handsome and the women beautiful in this perfect world.  Jack Lemmon with his inanities and pratfalls is a gas.  The drive around the hills of San francisco is perfect including the Lombard Street swoop.  The private detective is a horrible jerk and Jack takes him for a ride!  It is Laugh Out Loud Funny!

Back in the 1990's I met Jack Lemmon and his son at the Pebble Beach Lodge while sitting in the bar.  We shared a table and he introduced me. I had just seen Irma La Duce and could not believe I was sitting next to him. He was grizzled and yet charming.  Now more than ever I think he is an amazing actor. I love his dorky dancing and crazy determination, such as changing all the billboards all over town into farcical faces.

If all this sounds silly, then you know this film is not for you!

If it sounds delightful, go for it.",1458172800,,2524,4.446623093681917
613164,5,6303257313,"One of my all time favorite comedies, I first watched it in a film class at college.  It is a farce and Jack Lemmon is in all sorts of situations by pretending the next door neighbor is his wife (with his wife's knowledge) and having to sneak back and forth between yards because his boss thinks she is his wife.  Clean and funny.",1455667200,,330,4.222222222222222

613241,5,6303257313,"There was a style of filmmaking in the sixties that has sadly disappeared - the family friendly comedy. It's not child mild Disney fare, just clean enjoyable entertainment. Jack Lemmon plays his anxious everyman but the real star is American life in the sixties. The contemporary suburban homes, his job at a big city ad agency, convertible thunderbirds, and gorgeous women conspiring for a million dollar payday - there is plenty to look at when the story bogs down a bit in the second act with a bit too much silly farce. But the overall movie is a seldom seen delight that belongs in the library of anyone who misses the old Doris Day movies.",1397520000,2,645,4.6173913043478265

I saw the reviews of the incorrect packaging of the DVD and was nervous, but thought I would give it a shot-- I'm glad I did! This is the movie I remembered, which I loved for the 1960s screwball domestic life vs. work comedic theme (think Doris Day and Rock Hudson but with Jack Lemmon's great comic talent in addition to the supporting players). I was also very pleased I got the right movie. Love it!!!",1376956800,,516,4.222222222222222
613247,5,6303257313,"As with this film, if you like movies made in this time frame, you can go wrong. It is enjoyable to watch clean movies that did not involve using God's name in vain.

613327,2,6303257313,"A good cast, Jack Lemmon in particular, and nice 1964 San Francisco color locations are wasted on a romantic comedy that at 130 minutes goes on WAY too long! It starts pleasantly enough but after about 100 minutes you just want it to be over. The last half hour is both silly and boring and leads to an unsatisfying finish that you could see coming an hour earlier. I suspect undemanding 1964 audiences found this amusing enough but it doesn't play all that well in 2012. I wanted to like this one a lot more than I ultimately did,  I do realize mine is a minority opinion.",1349481600,,573,4.355140186915888

Everyone in advertising knows that sex sells, but Nurdlinger wouldn't hear of it.  Unless you can find a clean family man to represent his account, he would go elsewhere.  Fortunately, you found that you employ such a man: Sam Bissel.

If you are Sam, then yesterday was a good day.  The kids' grandmother took them off to camp and you got promoted to account executive of the Nurdlinger account.  And yesterday, you knew that your wife Min had gone to the airport to pick up her friend Janet, but you hadn't expected to find Janet in your shower . . . .

If you are Janet, you are very fortunate: you are about to inherit a huge estate!  One catch: you must be married.  Luckily, your divorce doesn't become final for another six months.  But the will could be contested, on the grounds that you are not living with your husband.  Hopefully your cousins, Jack and Irene - who are next in line - won't find out.

Wouldn't you know it, Jack and Irene show up to see if you had reconciled with Howard.  In mid small talk, Sam walks in and you introduce him as Howard.  And now, all you have got to do is keep up the pretense that Sam is Howard until the will is probated.  Unfortunately, when Mr. Nurdlinger sees you kissing Sam, he thinks you are Sam's wife Min . . . .

The only bit of strangeness is that when the movie first loads up, the screen says ""Disk Two.""  I imagine that the manufacturer probably broke up all the disks that came from ""The Jack Lemmon Collection"" set of DVDs and is releasing the individual disks.

I won't bother with re-telling the story line, other reviewers have taken care of that.  I will say that this is a ""must own"" for any true Jack Lemmon fan and any fan of just plain old fun movies.  For those who are old enough to remember the 1960s, as I am, the movie is also a fun trip down memory lane for styles, fashion, and cars.

613467,4,6303257313,"A very clever period comedy, with a superbly selected cast, who outdo themselves in all kinds of comedy scenes: many dialogue drive, some in mime, some straight ahead slapstick. Jack Lemmon everty bit as funny as in The Odd Couple, coming up later in the decade.

Some good, light satire on the 1964 advertising world, salted just enough with the presence of Edward G. Robinson as the President of Nurdlinger Eggs - scrupulously watching over his product...and the advertising team he is considering paying 600k for delivering a fresh, new campaign. Bissell (Lemon)is the fresh newcomer - straight out of the art department - the only staffer who has not been rejected by Edward G., because of immoral behavior. He's had the execs under surveillance for a while.

Lemmon himself is soon under surveillance, by the detective (Louis Nye) hired to find something wrong with the next door neighbor's behavior, as she (Romy Schneider)stands to inherit a fortune...if she meets with the stipulations of the will - a moral marriage.

Well, she's not *exactly* in a traditional marraige - she's waiting for divorce papers when she learns of the huge inheritance. Enter the recently promoted Lemmon...for a couple of days he'll play ""fill-in"", at least for the van parked across the street.

Not to give away the plot, which is the funniest element (along with Lemmon's Chaplinesque moves and [apparent] hilarious ad-libbing)! Some serious statements are made about what we will do for money...how appearances can fool the unsuspecting.

The plotline gets more and more complicated and normally, in a comedy, this is trouble. But here, with exceptionally strong acting, direction, and writing, we sit and wonder, what's gonna happen next? A ""situation comedy"" for the movies!

For this reviewer, the movie runs about 15 minutes too long and the sophisticated, inventive business quickly degenerates into frantic sillinesss, not compensated by the strong performances of Jack Lemmon, Dorothy Provine, Mike Connors, et. al.",1276387200,,2012,5.213622291021672

613471,4,6303257313,"Sam Bissel (Jack Lemmon) and his wife Minerva (Dorothy Provine) have an ideal life together. They have two beautiful daughters and Sam's job takes care of the family. Sure, he is no standout at the office, but he spends his leisure time at home creating strange art sculptures out of random trash items. Life is good.

All of that changes with Min's friend from college comes to town. Janet(Romy Schneider) is a beautiful, exotic divorcee who decides to move in next door to the Bissels. Suddenly, she inherits several million dollars, but only under the condition that she is married. In order to fool the private investigator that her greedy cousins hired, she ropes Sam in as her ""husband,"" much to his chagrin. He must sleep at her house, dress there, and accept her rides to work. Then he gets the promotion of a lifetime-- because he is a traditional family man. But they think Janet is his wife!

This is a classic screwball comedy filled with hilarious, although predictable, twists and turns. It is rather long, but never boring, and all of the actors are great at getting laughs. In fact, it could have been longer, as the ending seems a bit rushed and the gag with the billboards seems slightly unfinished.",1246838400,,1217,4.708920187793427

It was definitely worth the money and shipping to get it. I just wish that Amazon could find me two other movies I have been hunting for 7 years: Mary, Mary - Debbie Reynolds and Barry Nelson, early 60's and Apartment for Peggy - William Holden and Jeane Craine mid 40's. Oh, how I would appreciate the finding of these. I would spread the word to eveyone single soul I know that Amazon can do the impossible - find movies that are impossible to find. Thanks for being there.

613514,5,6303257313,"GOOD NEIGHBOR Sam is a strangely neglected American sex comedy of the 1960s, with Jack Lemmon, an actor I otherwise can do without, but here he strikes me as an accomplished farceur with more bite to him than most male stars of his day.  He has attitude; he might have appeared in ZOOLANDER with that edge.  Here he was a fairly good part as a sculptor who works during the day way down the ladder at a San Francisco ad agency--it's a very MAD MEN office, but more authentic in some ways, and the scenes of the admen exchanging dispirited glances at their busty, uninterested secretarial staff has the MAD MEN motif down pat.  I suppose casting Lemmon in this part must have been a calculated move on the parts of the producers to recall his work in Billy Wilder's famous film of THE APARTMENT, but kick me out of cineaste heaven, for I have to say I prefer this flop to the celebrated APARTMENT.  In fact GOOD NEIGHBOR SAM seems superior to all but the very best of Wilder's work and I wonder why David Swift isn't better known?

Swift surrounds Lemmon with a cast of perhaps too-familiar TV and movie faces who are all enough to make one sick, starting with Louis Nye and including ultra-weird sissy Edward Andrews--oh, and Robert Q. Lewis as a suburban neighbor voyeur.  Everyone's watching everyone else in this ummanageable plot, which involves two crazy impersonations--maybe one more than a conventional movie structure will allow.  In the first plot, add boss Andrews awards hapless Lemmon the coveted account manager position for Nurdlinger Foods because Nurdlinger (Edward G. Robinson, oddly tanned as if suffering from jaundice) has hired detectives who have proved that every single other man at the agency is living an adulterous life.  Lemmon, being a pure, devoted husband, gets a giant raise, but it comes just at the exact time when his own libidinous interests in his wife's best friend are tempting him to join the crowd of cheaters.  Why not, if everyone else is doing it?  Okay, that part is fairly ludicrous and probably turned off a lot of original moviegoers: it makes THE APARTMENT seem like a masterpiece of neo-realismo.

The second plot involves Sam's wife (Dorothy Provine) whose best friend Janet has recently been divorced and whose uncle has left her a fortune of $15,000,000 provided that she is happily married at the time of the will's disposition.  Oddly enough Janet has also moved into the empty house next door in Sam's little suburban Wisteria Lane.  I guess she had to, otherwise the story would never work out.  Suspicious relatives have hired a private eye to make sure that Janet is living with a husband, and Provine allows Janet to ""borrow her husband,"" a move which leads to unexpected pain and poignancy, but you knew that going in when you saw that Janet was going to be played by Austrian glumbette Romy Schneider, whose little face always looked like it was pressed against a glass window hungrily eyeing the lives of happy others.

It's Provine who's the revelation here, as Minerva ""Min"" Bissel, the wife who accidentally gives away her husband over a series of expertly directed and acted sex maneuvers.  Provine has an astonishing resemblance to Nicole Kidman, and it looks almost as if Kidman has been inserted into an older movie, opposite all dead people, through CGI effects.  Specifically she resembles Kidman in Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT, and she should, in my opinion, have won the Oscar for Best Actress in this part.  Can't believe she walked away from the movies to marry some dud!  She should have gone on to glorious things and still be acting today.  Maybe it's time for a comeback, she's still only 71!",1221696000,3,3670,4.776898734177215

The seller sent this movie extremely FAST as they stated they would, and the condition of this movie was as described. (It was a used VHS version).

613516,5,6303257313,"They sure don't make movies like they used to.  I am a HUGE Jack Lemmon fan and this has to be in my humble opinion, for what it's worth, one of Jack's funniest movies.  I saw it on TV during the 60's.  If memory serves me correctly, I believe Lemmon regretted making this movie and considered it one of his worst.  That said... I happen to think it is hilarious, filled with a great cast and memorable scenes of the old Hertz commercials showing bloopers of the ads being filmed with the Hertz man being lowered through the air into a supposedly moving car, constantly tripping over something as he's lowered into the car.  Those scenes are priceless.

Jack Lemmon plays Sam Bissell who is married to Min (Dorothy Provine).  Jack is an employee who works at the bottom entry level of a major Advertising Agency when suddenly he is chosen as an unknown and fresh candidate to be the Account Executive by the head of the Agency's powerful client, ""Nurdlinger Dairy"" to be their model of what they stand for: wholesome and family-oriented.

Min's beautiful European friend Janet (Romy Schneider) suddenly shows up on Sam & Min's doorstep after separating with the intent to divorce her husband (Mike Connors - formerly ""Mannix"").  Janet moves into the house next door then learns that her grandfather has died and left her an inheritance of $15 million IF she meets the qualifications of being happily married.  Enter Janet's relatives who want in on the inheritance and contest the Will.  The $15 million proves too irresistible to Janet so during the introduction between her relatives, Sam & Min Janet impulsively introduces Sam as her husband.

To convince Sam (& hesitant Min) to agree to let Sam play her husband until the legal hearing, Janet offers to share a portion of her inheritance to them.  Min hesitantly goes along with the plan.  But things get really crazy when Janet is suddenly introduced to the owner (played by Edward G. Robinson) of Nurdlinger Dairy as Sam's wife.  The pressure is on when Janet's suspicious relatives hire Louie Nye as a private investigator to find out if Sam is truly exactly who Janet claims him to be--her husband.

Louie the P.I. camps out across the street in a truck disguised as a vacuum-related business.  On the truck roof a vacuum is mounted top with the vacuum serving as a periscope vessel to enable Louie to spy on them.

It gets even more complicated when Janet's tentatively-divorced husband returns to reconcile but by now, pictures have been unknowingly taken of Sam & Janet for the Nurdlinger Dairy advertisement billboards which are now displayed all over town.  And the race is on.

This is a funny movie and guarantees some hard laughs.",1186790400,15,2697,4.771551724137931

613522,5,6303257313,"This movie should be on DVD. Anyone that enjoys Jack Lemmon in  comedy will thoroughly love this one. Fans of Doris Day and Rock Hudson comedies should enjoy it too. For that matter anyone that enjoys any of the comedies from the 1940s to 1970s will probably like it. This is one of Lemmon's best comedies. Be sure and catch this on TV since you can't find it at rental stores any longer and they unfortunately have not shown the wisdom to put it on DVD yet.

The plot is that Lemmon, who is married, has a married neighbor that needs him to pretend to be her husband to get an estate settlement. When her real husband comes home things get screwy as jealousy and trying to cover each others stories leads to some wacky chase scenes and painting billboards all over town. A good cast, decent writing, funny action, and good look at 1960s style comedy, make this fun to watch.",1136851200,35,875,4.395061728395062

613623,5,6303257313,Jack Lemmon and Romy Schneider absolutely run away with this brilliant mid 60's Tour De Force comedy complete with Devol sondtrack. From the moment Sam (Jack Lemmon) starts his rubber legged nerdy dance to Sam's wife Min (Dorothy Provine) piling on the Macaroni and cheese I laughed so hard I could not contain myself. It's that funny! It's absolutely incredible to see the powerfully sexy hip swinging Janet (Romy Schneider) matching Lemmon scene for scene. Then when the ever engaging and likable Mike Connors comes into the picture he ignites Dorothy Provine who was basically asleep till he hit the screen. The chemistry between the four main leads is a joy to watch. This movie is a must have and I recommend it in the strongest way possible.

613627,2,6303257313,"Quick! What early 60s film has a scene of Jack Lemmon roaring drunk and falling down the stairway of a posh San Francisco hotel?  No, it's not ""Days of Wine and Roses,""--it's the hyperactive but ultimately humorless ""Good Neighbor Sam."" Oddly enough Lemmon injected more humor into that dramatic turn than he can even begin to muster for this ostensible comedy.  Truth to tell, getting drunk is actually about as out of character for his clean-living, though mildly eccentric character can get, but it gives the film-makers one more excuse to go manic in that uniquely 60s style exemplified by ""Mad Mad Mad World"" et al.  Did anyone really believe that having Robert Q. Lewis parade around in his bathrobe pushing a broken-down lawnmower and carrying a duck was the epitome of hilarity?
It's not, but in case you're wondering if Lemmon is worth watching, the answer is a very qualified ""yes.""  I was also, I admit, a bit smitten with the young Romy Schneider, who plays Lemmon's wife's college roommate and best friend.  No one ever explains why this woman with a strong European accent (which alternates between French and Viennese) has an such an Anglo-sounding name as ""Janet.""  But that's the least of the movie's incongruities.  Point is, the talented cast (which also includes just about every character actor you remember from the era) cannot really breathe much life into this frantic attempt at comedy.
Some reviewers below found the depiction of early 60s suburbia nostalgic.  Yeah, it's all there: the split level; sliding glass doors leading to the patio; the fiesta wear; the pet duck--the pet duck?!?  Oh, that's where the zaniness comes in.  The CONTRIVED zaniness, that is.  Lemmon fans may still want to catch this, but add it to your collection?  Nah, no way you'd want to keep this one around the house (even if it IS a split-level). No,  rent it--or better yet, borrow it from the library for free.",994982400,3,1918,4.846625766871166
