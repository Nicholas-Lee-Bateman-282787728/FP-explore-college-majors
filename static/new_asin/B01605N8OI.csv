7454780,4,B01605N8OI,I love this work out! I just wish the modifications were consistent through out. I find myself making my own modifications for the harder moves.,1456012800,2,144,4.8
8735210,4,B01605N8OI,"The workout is great, easy to follow, and the music flows with the exercises.  Interesting music and dance, I thoroughly enjoyed this part!  The only issue I have is the editing and the instructor confusing me with saying the opposite side.  She says left when it is your right and vice versa.  The editing cuts off in the middle of the exercise, zooms in when you need a broad view, and other inconsistencies.  However, since I have not found a better dance DVD I still enjoy this and reach for it often after enjoying for over a year once every other week.",1530489600,,558,4.431372549019608
8735211,5,B01605N8OI,I just got my dvd in the mail today and I couldn't wait to try it out. It was fun but HARD lol. I started to get tired during the warm up but I made it through the workout. The workouts switched back and forth from high intensity to low intensity making this a HIT workout. This DVD is going to be apart of my permanent home fitness collection.,1511740800,,344,4.0

8735213,5,B01605N8OI,"I am not the most coordinated but i love dancehall and carribean dancing and music, this dvd encompasses these into a great workout, im a huge fan of workouts that depict ladies that look like me,  a new favorite, no extra equipment needed. Must try!",1495584000,,250,4.555555555555555
8735214,5,B01605N8OI,"I had never heard of Socacize, but found it here on Amazon by searching for Carribean dance workout video.

I'm SO glad I purchased this workout DVD!  These ladies have rhythm, the dance moves are exciting and fun, and the workout really kicked my butt. I wasn't really able to get through all of the DVD without stopping, because it really works you out well. But I will work up to it, because I'm having so much fun, I know I'll want to do this DVD everyday!

The music is excellent, goes great with each workout and each move. I really hope they continue to release more DVD workouts in the future.

It's so much more fun and energizing than my Zumba and Piloxing DVDs!!!",1478908800,3,674,4.368
8735215,4,B01605N8OI,"If you're looking for a challenging cardio workout that feels fun and non-workout-esque, try this video. The dances can be modified until you're able to keep up with the fit ladies who are killing it in this video. If you're like me, who is in average physical condition for an American late 30s working female, it's going to be a while before that happens! But the video is definitely fun and something to look forward to doing, even if you don't love exercise.

I give this 4 stars instead of 5 because there aren't any demos of the moves. You just have to follow along, and sometimes the video doesn't show the instructors' feet. I like dancing to hip hop and reggae at the club and shows, so I'm picking up the moves without a lot of issue. However if you're new to this type of dancing, it could take a while to learn from this video.

A great feature is the video is divided into segments, so you can choose to do just one segment. I'm definitely doing these one at a time! Like I said, it's a challenging cardio workout but it's modifiable to most fitness levels, and a whole lot more fun than the elliptical or treadmill. I'm glad I bought it.",1477699200,2,1151,4.348837209302325
8735216,5,B01605N8OI,"High energy, I love it. I am Jamaican and I love the dance moves. I feel as though I'm dancing and having fun to music that I love but I also feel the burn of a workout.",1463788800,4,169,3.5945945945945947
8735217,5,B01605N8OI,"Once you get the hang og the steps, it is a great workout. You will definitely get a good sweat doing this work out. It isn't easy so prepare you self.",1461542400,2,151,3.903225806451613
8735218,3,B01605N8OI,This DVD was not what I expected. I thought it would be more choreographed calypso/soca dancing. But it's just high energy aerobics to soca music. Disappointed.,1460592000,,160,5.1923076923076925
8735219,5,B01605N8OI,"Bought for my Wife, hasn't complained. Great buy.",1459123200,,49,5.25
