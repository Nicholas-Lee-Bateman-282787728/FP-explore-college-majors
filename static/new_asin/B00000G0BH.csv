1214304,3,B00000G0BH,"in my opinion, the zane grey paramounts were some of the best early sound westerns ever made. they were the training ground for many future stars as randolph scott, buster crabbe,dean jagger, and yes even shirley temple! to the last man has a strong cast with such notable villians of the time as noah beery sr. and jack larue. when they are on the screen you know supreme villiany is at hand.randolph scott as the main character, and esther ralston as the heroine stand out in this zane grey western with above average performances for its time. the saga of two feuding clans,span two decades in the film and has a stunning climax. as far as the quality of the tape itself, one has to remember, back in the 1930s, each studio was trying to establish itself in the early talkie era. for example,paramounts products seem to have more grey, while rko had a darker look to it. the studios had their own look to their films. this title is no exception. contrast is light gray. but ala in all for 1933 its ok. try it, afterall it was shirley temples first feature!",989107200,7,1059,4.492227979274611
1214305,2,B00000G0BH,"To the Last Man"" is a fairly typical, straightforward Western. It's the old 'Hatfield/McCoy' family feud scenario, complete with gunfights, cowboys on horseback and young lovers that cross the enemy lines to stay together. There isn't anything particularly Earthshaking or memorable here.
Perhaps the most interesting feature of ""To the Last Man"" is the presence of a five year old Shirley Temple in a small role as Randolph Scott's daughter. She did the film well before her child star days, while she was under contract at a Poverty Row studio and doing bit part and walk-on work around Hollywood. Her screen brother, Delmar Watson, appeared with her again 5 years later in ""Heidi"" at Fox.
If you're a fan of early talkie Westerns you might like this movie, but if not, ""To the Last Man"" might not keep your attention for long.",982281600,7,829,4.845070422535211

The story begins with a man cranking a printing press. ""General Lee Surrenders"" is the headline for April 1865. At war's end the horses and wagons were parceled out to the soldiers, allowing them to work for themselves when they go home. One man plans to move his family out west, to leave squabbling relatives behind. [This still happens.] A young boy shoulders his grandpa's rifle. The Colby's fight back. Grandma Spelvin hears the bad news. Mark Hayden will go to the law. Jed Colby gets 15 years for shooting Jed Spelvin. Mark heads west with his two children. One man has a team of oxen (the draft animal preferred for their fuel efficiency). Mark stakes a claim to his property. Fifteen years later Jed Colby is released from prison. His daughter Ellen has complaints. Joe Daggs will go west with the Colby's, they will settle in Nevada close to the Hayden ranch.

The Colby's steal Hayden's cattle until they can wipe them out. Ellen is headstrong. She tussles with Daggs. We learn about the Hayden ranch and its people. Will the Kentucky feud continue? Jed Spelvin says he will protect his property. Lynn Hayden rides by and meets Ellen, a lady. We learn about Ellen's past! Lynn shaves. [Some considered this a waster of time.] They share breakfast, then learn about their family names. Lynn learns more about the local conditions. A shot is fired at a young girl! Is this a trap? Lynn has a present for Ellen. That night cattle thieves drive off the white-faced cattle (Herefords for meat). Ellen learns the truth about ""White Cloud"", and kisses Lynn. Three Colby men attack Lynn, who wins the fight. Ellen tells her father of her plans.

The Colby men approach the Hayden ranch. The Hayden's defend themselves. Will the Hayden men arrive in time to chase the Colby gang away? Bill rides in tied to his saddle, dead. What will they do now? Mark Hayden rides in . There will be a chase. An explosion throws rocks into the canyon below. Daggs double-crosses Jed Colby. Lynn wounded, survives the blast to visit Ellen, then is hidden when Daggs appears. There is a fight between Daggs and Ellen. Lynn ends it. There will be a happy ending for Ellen and Lynn.

This was adapted from a Zane Grey novel. Did that young girl look like Shirley Temple? It is a good story about relocated families, if you can believe it. Not many Westerns used a story about feuding families. The quality of this film is very good for its age, and it is not a low budget production. The underdressed Ellen did not match the usual dress for women around the 1880s, or even the 1930s. Was her nude swimming an extra attraction?",1394755200,,2637,4.604255319148936
7908715,2,B00000G0BH,"This may be a fine, early Randolph Scott-starring, Henry Hathaway-directed Western.  It is hard to tell.  The original (from which this and other public domain copies derive) was obviously in poor shape with lots of splices, too-dark night scenes, film damage, and some missing frames.  It is a surprisingly brutal western for this early in the 30's.  I sought this out because of my fondness for the work of silent actress Esther Ralston.  Even in this almost unwatchable print, her verve and attractiveness stand out.  There is even a semi-nude swimming scene.  An interesting supporting cast includes Noah Beery Sr., Barton MacLane, Gail Patrick, Buster Crabbe, and Shirley Temple (!!).  We can hope for a true restoration but that seems unlikely for this B western.  Perhaps a better original exists that may show up on TCM.  TO THE LAST MAN (aka LAW OF VENGEANCE) is supposed to run about 70 minutes.  This TGG Direct copy runs at least five minutes less than that.  Other public domain copies--presumably also of poor quality and incomplete--are sold from Roan and Alpha Video.",1390003200,2,1083,4.988826815642458
7908716,4,B00000G0BH,"My experience with minor brand DVD companies (such as this unnamed plain box one) has been satisfactory, as I'm not interested in commentary, deleted scenes or other bonus features, that is, stuff these discs don't offer. Transfers are ""best available source"" and quality can vary from very good to only fair.

.
Action highlight of TO THE LAST MAN, Henry Hathaway's fine Zane Grey adaptation is a dynamite-caused rockslide that kills all but one of a large group of vengeful riders.

Hathaway uses superimposed white letters to introduce characters/actors as they first appear. This goes on for almost 15 minutes. Seen in an uncredited role is adorable 5-year-old Shirley Temple, who is twice almost hit with rifle fire!

The two families in this Hatfield/McCoy feud story are the Haydens and the Colbys.

After Mark Hayden (Brecher) testifes against him, Jed Colby (Beery) is sentenced to 20 years for killing Mark's father-in-law. Jed stews in jail while the Haydens relocate from Kentucky to land near the Sierras (features beautiful outdoor cinematography of California's Big Bear Lake region).

Mark wants to end the bloody inter-family war but Jed has other ideas. Once paroled, he moves his clan west and renews hostilities with their sworn enemies. The above-mentioned rockslide is one of his ploys, as are cattle and horse rustling plus an arson attack on the Hayden property in which little Shirley is twice almost killed.

Despite its age, this PARAMOUNT western drama holds the attention. Highly recommended!
