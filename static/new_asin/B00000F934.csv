7907487,2,B00000F934,"For those interested in a comprehensive video providing techniques and tips, this is not the collection for you.  However, those interested in some of the finest file footage of offshore fishing, this video collection provides you enough to satisfy your needs. Like all specialty items in a narrow market, the price for this collection is expensive; especially if your unfamiliar with the author or the host.  I would suggest if you are looking for tips and techniques, go to Saltwater Magazine and order George Poveromo's collection of videos.  If you're looking for just a good collection of footage, take a chance that this video meets your criteria, if it does, you can always buy the rest of the collection.",984873600,,712,4.966386554621849
