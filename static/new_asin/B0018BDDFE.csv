3414466,4,B0018BDDFE,"Don't get me wrong, I really love these and am glad to have them. The problem for me is that you get about 2 hours worth here, while the Hanna-Barbera collections Space Ghost and Birdman each run a whopping 7 hours for about the same price. I'm no expert, but it seems like there should be enough of these cartoons to put together a better collection.",1218758400,3,351,4.333333333333333
3414467,2,B0018BDDFE,"I just bought this DVD today...the day it came out.  I bought it for nostalgic purposes but, also for my twin girls who are 7 years old.  They are both into the superhero animation and to be honest, the current animation is too violent for them...more on that in a moment.

The transfer was pretty good, although, the JLA opening didn't look as crisp as the other toons.

I confess I don't remember too much about the toons from my youth.  I do remember the red, white and blue backrounds changing at a rapid speed and Hawkman winging his way from space, the end credits and secret clues.

The toons fit the bill, but my disappointment comes in that they didn't include the original Superman/Aquaman opening, end credits, secret clue segments, or teasers.  When you buy a DVD, you expect all that on there and it was missing.  Mind you, my girls couldn't care less about that.  They enjoyed the episodes they saw, mainly Flash and JLA.

They were very entertained, so while I was disappointed that the DVD didn't include the extras that I mentioned, my girls really enjoyed what they saw and what they will see.

Wrapping up, I mentioned that I really haven't introduced them to current DC animation except for select episodes of Superman, The Animated Series and Justice League...they're a bit too violent.

Funny thing is the reason why the original Filmation superhero toons ceased production is because TV execs at the time deemed them too violent...if they could only see the toons now...",1218499200,4,1493,4.722007722007722
3414468,3,B0018BDDFE,"I think that you will only be interested in these cartoons if you grew up with them as a kid.

I did, and rememebr them fondly because of it, but to be honest they are not that good (The notalgia value that I have for these cartoons is the only reason I have given these cartoons 3 stars).

If you are interested in DC characters in animation (good or bad) you might also be interested (Since this was the first time that most of these DC characters had never been done in animation).

But if you are newer comics fan, you might want to stick with the better DC animated adaptations like the various Bruce Timm produced Batman, Superman, and Justice League animated series. Not to mention the DC direct animated features.

Like I said, I remember these cartoons fondly from childhood, So I will enjoy seeing them again, otherwise I would stay away unless you are curious to have a look this bit of DC/Filmation history.",1217894400,3,919,4.485029940119761
3414469,5,B0018BDDFE,"Another fine release of the classic Filmation cartoons. Green Lantern, The Flash, The Atom, Hawkman, and of course Superman are part of these DC cartoons. The music along with the simple plots to these shows are what made these cartoons so popular in the '60's. Really enjoyed The New Adventures of Superman, now waiting for the remaining episodes of Superman, along with Superboy. It's about time they dust off these shows and release them from the vault!!!",1216771200,2,458,4.961038961038961
3414470,5,B0018BDDFE,"I also have had to suffer through bootlegs of these awesome toons (nothing like the Teen Titans opening with the 16MM film messing up) and bad edits on USA and cartoon Network (Remember JLA 'Bad Day on Black Mountain'? How did Flash and Atom get captured? :P ). I hope these have the openings and the intermissions included in this set and of course, that the eps are UNCUT. I don't know how they're gonna spread it out over 2 dvd's so hopefully there will be some cool extras.",1216080000,,477,4.370786516853933
3414471,5,B0018BDDFE,Unlike the other reviews I was not born yet in the 60's.  I've never seen these cartoons until I was watching the cartoon network in the late 90's.  If you love the Superfriends and superhero cartoons then this is for you.  I love the days when a cartoon was just pure fun.  Not much plot or complexity and sometimes I love it that way.  It still comes on the Boomerang channel as shorts between shows but I would love to have the DVD's.  I have all the filmation superhero cartoons on burned DVD's with very good quality but I like to have originals.  Now give us the Batman 1960's cartoons.  Why do we have to beg for this stuff all the time?????????????????,1210118400,2,660,4.352459016393443
3414472,5,B0018BDDFE,"The previous reviews give an accurate account of which cartoons to expect in this series.
Here's a lot of superfluous waffle, for all those who actually want the fine details of how these cartoons were originally aired.
They first screened as part of the 1967 Superman Aquaman Hour of Adventure, which also included (per episode) 2 Superman stories (not yet on DVD. See below), 2 Aquaman stories, and a Superboy story (release problems detailed below).
So normally, following an Aquaman story, you'd have seen (on tv) a collection of Justice Leaguers and Teen Titans moving around the screen to a 30 second Ted Knight narration ""Stay tuned for another exciting adventure, featuring a guest star from this world of Super Super Heroes.""
Then you'd see a commercial break.
Then you'd get the customized beginning theme for a Justice League/ Atom / Hawkman / Flash/ Green Lantern / Teen Titans story.(If you saw these guest star stories on the Superman Batman Adventures on Cartoon Network in the early 2000s, you'd have noticed that these two ""Stay tuned"" and ""Character Begin"" themes were missing, and the stories were often ruthlessly cut too. (One of the worst examples was in the Justice League America story ""Bad Day on Black Mountain."" The team divides up their tasks. Flash says ""Atom and I go for the rocket base."" (The actual sequence of Atom and Flash doing their mission was completely edited out.
So I'm very pleased to see that Warner are releasing this lot in full, and can only hope it will include the customized character begin themes and the ""Stay tuned..."" theme (even if only as extras).
In Australia, of course, we saw the shows separately. The Superman (and Superboy) cartoons (from the two latter shows) were just packaged with the previous Superman series.
The Aquaman and guest star stories were aired as ""Aquaman, King of the Seven Seas"" show.
The Batman stories were aired as ""The Adventures of Batman"". (Here's hoping we'll see them eventually too. Last year gave us the 1977 New Adventures of Batman, which was great).

However, lest we forget to remind Warner Bros, an above review's comments about the Superman cartoons aren't quite right. The 36 cartoons from last year's Superman release are only the Superman cartoons from the 1966 Superman Show.
There were another batch of 16 cartoons created for the 1967 Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure (WHICH WEREN'T INCLUDED IN THE SET RELEASED IN 2007).
There were a third batch: this time of 8 x 2-part stories created for the 1968 Batman Superman Hour, to match the 2-part format of the Batman stories. (THESE ALSO WEREN'T INCLUDED IN THE 2007 RELEASE OF NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN).
So at some point, I would hope we can still convince Warner Bros to put out a second volume of ""New Adventures of Superman"" to include all the episodes from the 1967-68 serieses detailed above. An above reviewer made an honest mistake, but don't think you've seen them all yet.
As well as that, all 3 shows had Superboy stories in the middle, which we won't see, unless a resolution of the Superboy rights issues has occurred/will occur.

ALL THAT SAID, I'M JUST BEING IMPATIENT FOR WHAT WE HAVEN'T HAD YET. GRAB THIS RELEASE AND REVEL IN IT. YOU CAN PULL OUT ALL YOUR JUSTICE LEAGUE, GREEN LANTERN, HAWKMAN, ATOM, FLASH, TEEN TITANS COMICS AND READ THEM AGAIN, ONCE THESE SHOWS HAVE PUT YOU IN THE MOOD.
IT'S A GREAT PACKAGE, AND THE COVER ART LOOKS GOOD TOO.",1210032000,52,3420,4.834470989761092
3414473,5,B0018BDDFE,"After watching this as a kid, I've been forced to purchase mediocre quality VHS tapes and DVDs of these particular cartoons.  They're all from 8th generation sources, and are all washed out.

THIS is the real deal.  Pristine originals, lovingly restored to their former glory.

And Ted Knight doing the narration (and many voices too) just adds to the fun.

If you liked the classic Filmation Superman and Batman cartoons, then you'll love these!",1210032000,11,446,4.972972972972973

These superhero cartoons were bookend between a superman or an aquaman episode. If you love classic animation of the 1960 DC heroes, this DVD is what you need to get.

1966, I remember parking my butt on the couch  in front of the tv set and watching these shows. Similar to what kids do today with shows like Ben 10, TMNT and Johnny Test. These cartoon are over 40 years old and the quality is still there

Here's  what you will be getting on this collection:

  Between Two Armies
  Target Earth
  Bad Day of Black Moutain

The Atom
  Invasion of the Beetle People
  The Planet Master
  House of Doom

You must rememember these are the 1960's incarnation of these DC  heroes. They are well done Saturday Morning animation. It is not as slick as today's animation. I have seen all of these cartoon at Science Fiction conventions. These mini 6-8 adventures are well crafted, just not as special effected as today's toons are.

This DVD collection is good stuff for DC Cartoon fans, completests of Filmation animation (It is a shame that the Filmation Tarzan is not available) or people who just like a short cartoon adventure with her or her favorite hero

So Get these and relive your childhood

While not as well-animated or well-written as the later Superman and Batman series on the WB and the Justice League shows on Cartoon Network (all available on DVD), these shows are true to the DC Comics of the Silver Age, with many of them written by DC writer-editor George Kashden.

3414503,4,B0018BDDFE,"This Warner Brothers' DVD release of two disks forms part of the DC Comics Classic Collection, and comes from the 1967/68 period when Filmation held the license rights to animate DC Comics superheroes on Saturday morning television.  The short eighteen episodes included in this set (lasting roughly eight minutes or so each) once formed part of 'The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure', and were sandwiched in-between the second season of 'The New Adventures of Superman', the second season of 'The Adventures of Superboy' and episodes of 'The Adventures of Aquaman'.
The interesting thing for me regarding this DVD set is that these episodes are the first time that somewhat minor DC characters have been used in their own show, or at least in segments of it.  These adventures occur before Hanna-Barbera picked up the license to produce the iconic 'Super Friends' series, which ran for many years during the Silver Age of comic books.  Granted, as with most other Filmation series at the time and over the years, the animation can seem pretty primitive and flat, plus there is a fairly high count of stock footage utilisation.  However, I believe this adds to the overall charm of the series in an era when superhero resurgence was just gaining ground, and young boys especially could experience televised adventures of their favourite comic book characters for the first time on a Saturday morning.
Each character and team receive three episodes each that focus on their adventures, with the official 'as-broadcast' end credits that ran at the end of each episode of the 'Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure' included as an extra, made available at the end of the Episode menu.  The Atom (Ray Palmer), The Flash (Barry Allen), Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) and Hawkman (Carter Hall) each receive their own three episodes of solo adventures with, usually, either space alien invaders to contend with, or mad scientists and their robotic creations.  It is worth remembering that this was a time of the Silver Age that the space race was in full motion and the idea of space flight and life on other planets permeated the media and comic books much more heavily than during past decades.  The team episodes (again given three episodes each) consist of the usual alien invader villains from Pluto or Jupiter, for instance, and star both the Justice League of America (starring all the adult heroes partaking in the Filmation Adventures at the time) and the Teen Titans, consisting of Speedy (Roy Harper), Kid Flash (Wally West), Aqualad (Garth) and Wonder Girl (Donna Troy).
These Filmation shorts, especially those concerning the Justice League and the Teen Titans, can definitely be considered an important part of animation history (especially regarding comic book animation), in that this was the first time these characters had been immortalised in animated form, offering viewers a sort of precursor to the upcoming Super Friends series and the later shows making up the DC Animated Universe of the 1990s.  Although undeniably quite repetitive and predictable at times, this set is definitely worth some respect as part of the Filmation Adventures that started it all (following Max Fleischer's Superman animated movie shorts of the 1940s of course).
Regarding the DVD features, there are colourful interactive menus on both discs (although Warner obviously made a mistake placing pictures of Hanna-Barbera's Birdman where Hawkman should have been shown - signs of a rushed release!), with additional subtitle and audio options for the English hard-of-hearing and for the Portugese speaking community.  Regarding bonus content, there are trailers available to view of some latest releases from the Warner Brothers vault, including Charlie Brown, Popeye & Friends, the Smurfs and the Lego Batman video-game (there are additional trailers played upon loading the second disc into your DVD player of other Warner Brothers animated releases).  However, the one hefty extra is a near-forty-minute documentary surrounding the life and work of Fimation's founder Lou Scheimer, titled 'Animation Maverick: The Lou Scheimer Story'.  In this, there is interesting discussion of how Lou Scheimer founded and maintained his business empire of Filmation from friends, family, ex-colleagues and fellow admirers within the animation industry.
I would most definitely recommend this DVD set to early animation enthusiasts, to comic book historians and fans of DC's Justice League, if only to explore the animated first outing of some of the comic book industry's most famous and loved characters.  As an accompaniment to these shorts, I would highly recommend the first season of 'The New Adventures of Superman', available on DVD (hopefully later seasons will become available in the future) and the two-DVD set of 'The Adventures of Aquaman', which concluded each episode of the 'Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure' in 1967 and '68.",1370304000,5,4920,5.2774936061381075

3414519,4,B0018BDDFE,"The adaptation of DC's superheroes The Atom, The Flash, The Green Lantern, Hawkman, the Teen Titans, and The Justice League of America, in DC Super Heroes The Filmation Adventures (1967), provides a pretty good representation of the classic comic book characters.  Each superhero or team is featured in three episodes, which each run about 7 minutes long, with narration provided by Ted Knight.  These cartoons originally appeared on the Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure (1967-68).  There are a total of 18 adventures on two discs, although with a combined runtime of about 125 minutes, everything could have been squeezed on one disc.

Back in 1967, the quality of the stories was probably secondary to the coolness of just seeing characters from the printed page of a comic, come to life and move in two dimensional space, some for the first time.  Even with a wide variety of characters, George Kashdan does a fairly decent job, as most of the stories are fantasy based, and seem appropriate to the character.  Bob Haney contributes one episode of the Flash.

The colors are rich, and the prints are generally clean.  Stock shots appear to be used when possible, and some of the backgrounds may be a little overused at times, but where it counts, there is usually some attention to detail in the drawing of the characters.  Sharpness is decent, although there are some occasional blurry spots.  The animators do a nice job with depicting things like the Atom changing size, the Flash moving at great speed, and the effects of the Green Lantern's power ring.  The threats include robots, giant insects, weird aliens, and supervillains of various types.

The music featured includes original material, as well as compositions and cues used in other cartoons.  In some features the music tends to be more in the background, while in others it is more heavily emphasized.  The cartoon features top voice talent that includes, Paul Frees, Pat Harrington Jr., Ted Knight, Vic Perrin, and Gerald Mohr.

While these short adventures are not on the level of a classic like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jonny-Quest-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0001MZ7J6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jonny Quest - The Complete First Season</a>, they are rather similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-The-67-Collection-6-Volume-Animated-Set/dp/B0001I55O2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man - The '67 Collection (6 Volume Animated Set)</a>, which is from the same time period.  They are a nice representation of DC's superhero universe, and are just something light and fun, to be enjoyed for pure nostalgia value, by fans of all ages.

An interesting bonus is a 40 minute feature about Lou Scheimer, who along with Hal Sutherland, founded Filmation, the animation company that besides superhero cartoons, also produced The Archies, Fat Albert, and an animated adaptation of Star Trek, among many others.",1333152000,2,2986,5.674157303370786
3414520,5,B0018BDDFE,"When I first seen DC Super Heroes: The Filmation Adventures, I started to remember back in the day when they first came out (Mind you, I was 3 or 4 years old at the time.)  There was a time when some of these same episodes were on with 'The Superman/Aquaman Adventure Hour' in the late 60's.  With that being said, THIS is the way cartoons were meant to be viewed.  It didn't have to be fancy, or teach us a lesson (Other than Good is better than Evil,) or even have to sell us a product based on the show.  It was good, clean fun.  The characters were made to be like their comic-book counterparts, even with the very minor changes to their costumes.  It was a great nostalgic trip, loaded with action & adventure.  The stories didn't have to be complicated, so anyone at any age could enjoy them.  It was, by far, one of the best DVD purchases I've made in a long time.  Only one little question, though it's not a complaint:  How did a picture of BIRDMAN get in with other DC super heroes in the main menu?",1331856000,,1009,4.208333333333333

It is interesting that that aforemetioned heroes each had only three episodes. They are ""guest"" heroes who appear on a rotating basis during the show's run. There are slight differences between the TV episodes and their comic book counterparts. But despite that I recommend this DVD because as I metioned before it collects these little seen ""rare"" episodes together. No doubt DC Comics fans will like this DVD. In conclusion I will say that Hawkman's bird-like spaceship on TV looks more cool than it's comic book counterpart which is just a rocket with red stars!",1331078400,,747,5.181818181818182

This set contains a mix of super heroes (before Super Friends) such as the Atom, Flash, Hawkman, Green Lantern, Teen Titans, and probably the first animated version of Justice League of America.  The stories are short yet action packed, would have been nice if some of the films had been remastered or cleaned up a little (some of the material shows dirt, scratches, or slight color fade).  Overall I highly recommend this collection to fans of comics/super heroes or action/adventure animation.  Regular viewers of Batman: the Brave and the Bold or Justice League series- this is where it all began.",1306886400,,1021,4.707865168539326

I decided to buy them and love them as much as I did as a young kid. I said to myself I hope they would release the older JLA/Teen Titan cartoons. Finally after months of waiting the next installment in the Filmation series has finally been released. So I purchased it and love it also.

I do hope in time that the rights of The Adventures of Superboy and Kyrpto, will get settled and be eventually released on dvd. I have seen it for sale on Vhs. Batman and Robin also is another I would like to see be released if it has not been so, as I recall watching it also.

It was a very innocent time that will never be duplicated again.  By today's standards, they would be called simplistic.  However, they were the first to attempt the DC characters on a budget for a television audience.

The highlight of this entire package was the documentary of Filmations's Lou Scheimer and Hal Sutherland.  They were the  men behind an era of cartoons long forgotten.  Lou Scheimer built the studio from the ground up into the most popular cartoon studios in the 60's and 70's.  This great documentary was produced by Filmation Animation historian, Andy Mangels. It wraps up what otherwise would have been a set of cartoons without any historical frame of reference,  like many a DVD cartoon collection.

The cartoons looks very good for their age with some dirt and scratches for sure, but I would have liked for the cartoons to be shown in the original format and order along with the stay tunes commercial bumpers etc.

It's a small grievance though as I was really taken back watching these 7 minute adventures narrated by Ted Knight. The Atom, Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman Justice League Of America and The Teen Titans are on this set and you can pick up The Aquaman, Superman and Batman set on their own sets from the same era. One the plus side there is a 40 minute documentary on Lou Scheimer the founder of filmation studios which is worth as much as the cartoons themselves!",1235433600,2,1016,4.398936170212766
3414533,4,B0018BDDFE,"During one of the episodes on this two DVD set, some aliens are using a machine to bore into the surface of the Earth.  The Atom, in an incredibly timed line exclaims, ""Stop this boring action!""  I'm tempted to say I could not agree more but that would be trite.  This latest release from the Warner Bros. vaults features 18 episodes featuring The Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman, The Atom, Teen Titans, and the Justice League of America.  Produced by Filmation, these short (6 - 7 minutes) cartoons were shown as part of the Superman/Aquaman hour that ran on CBS from 1967 - 1968.  I've never quite figured out why Aquaman got to co-star in the show as opposed to one of these other more popular heroes.  Each of these heroes/teams star in three episodes each.

At the time, Filmation was one of the last American animation companies still doing work in-house, rather than farming it out to companies in Europe or Asia where it could be produced cheaper.  But lets not congratulate Filmation too much.  In order to compete, their production had to cut a lot of corners.  They utilized rotoscoping, the practice of tracing over live footage, quite heavily.  This was cheaper than traditional cell animation and gave the show a more fluid look.  They also used stock footage...over and over and over...You'd see the heroes run by the same building or swim by the same plant numerous times in the series.

The episodes were plotted very lightly.  With only seven minutes to work with there wasn't a whole lot of time to devote to character or plot development.  Basically you get a threat...and the hero beating the threat and saving the day.  Still there is a certain nostalgic charm to watching the series.  Kids of the day certainly had to be thrilled to see these heroes on their TV's, most of them for the very first time.  And it had to be extremely cool to see the Justice League in action as a team.  Where's Batman you ask?  Well, at the time, the Batman Live action TV show was still running on rival ABC but the caped crusader would join Superman in the Batman/Superman Hour in 1968 - 1969.

Ted Knight, well-known as the narrator of the Superfriends is along for the ride again, both as narrator and the voice of numerous villains.  His voice provides a comforting familiarity, which crossed generations from this show and then well into the 1970's with the Superfriends.

It's interesting to compare this show to Marvel's Super Hero cartoons of the mid-1960's.  The Marvel cartoons, produced by Grantray-Lawrence were nothing more than panels from actual comics that were given a very limited animation.  Still, there was something to be said for seeing the art of Jack Kirby on your TV.

The real attraction of this set is the 38 minute documentary on Filmation's founder Lou Scheimer.  Scheimer, still going strong at age 79, provides an incredibly interesting interview about Filmation's history and the production of these cartoons.  Longtime director Hal Sutherland, as well as many of the animators who worked for the company, also share their recollections.

By any standards, these are not great cartoons in terms of their production but they do provide a very valuable link to some of the earliest, made-for-TV, superhero cartoons.",1233014400,,3249,4.8140794223826715

But that isn't the point. It doesn't have to.

That's like asking how The Andy Grifith Show stacks up to House.

If you're my age, there's something just so nice seeing these cartoons that represent a different era.

I will get my kids to watch it, just like they watch F-Troop, Beverly Hilbillies and others. And I'm sure they'll enjoy them.",1227571200,,483,4.517241379310345
3414535,2,B0018BDDFE,"Nostalgia is a fair reason to buy this DVD but don't be shocked if the cheesy stock footage fails to charm your children. Filmation Adventures hasn't aged well.

Why is there such nostalgia for this series? Well, until Filmation came along the DC animated universe consisted of only Superman and Batman. No one had drawn animated versions of The Flash, The Atom, Hawkman, Green Lantern as well as the Teen Titans and Justice League of America.

Produced in the late 1960s, the Filmation Adventures reflect more of a 1950s ""us-versus-them"" theme when superheroes fought Communist metaphors instead of domestic threats to society. The episodes set superheroes against aliens, monster bugs and, well... more and more monster alien bugs. Despite the fact that you see the first appearances of many DC superheroes, the series is devoid of many, classic DC Comics villians, including Lex Luthor, Brainiac, the Riddler, Black Manta, Sinestro and Captain Cold.

3414536,4,B0018BDDFE,"For those of us who are DC cartoon freaks, this release is wonderful. Before Hanna-Barbara's put forth the Justice League in the seventies Super-Friends, Filmation beat them to it (for the most part) with the Aquaman/Superman Power Hour.

While Batman was tied up elsewhere (the Adam West series), Filmation was able to animate Superman, Aquaman, Atom, Green Lantern, Flash, Hawkman, and the Teen Titans (minus Robin).

Probably one of the greatest strengths of the DVD, is Andy Mangels fifty minute documentary on the Filmation studios. Outside of Hanna/Barbara one of of the animation power houses of the sixties/seventies. That alone recommends this purchase.

Compared to today's animated adventures, the stories may seem awfully tame. Basically, evil villain has plan to conquer America and/ or the world. Hero hears about plot and goes to stop it. After losing a preliminary battle or two, the hero eventually succeeds. That's the basic plot. These stories also lack today's angst or emotional dilemnas' for the hero.

Maybe there's something to be said for that.

I do have one minor quibble with this set. It is missing the original opening Aquaman Superman Power of Adventure Opening theme, which was a fun element all to itself. One can track it down on youtube.com if interested. According to various sources, the Batman 69 animated program might be next for digital release. If so, the DC cartoon classic will be one step further closer to completion.

3414537,4,B0018BDDFE,"DC Comics Super Heroes - The Filmation Adventures
(Released August 12, 2008 by Warner Home Video)  DVD Review by Joe Torcivia

Riddle me this, Batman... When is a show not a show?

When it is merely PART OF ANOTHER SHOW!

And, that's exactly what you're getting in DC Comics Super Heroes - The Filmation Adventures!  In this case, the filler segments from 1967's THE SUPERMAN / AQUAMAN HOUR OF ADVENTURE, which was the sequel / successor to Filmation's trend setting THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN from 1966.

Placed within each hour-long episode of THE SUPERMAN / AQUAMAN HOUR OF ADVENTURE were short cartoons of various Silver Age DC Super Heroes.  Those being: The Atom, The Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman, Justice League, and Teen Titans.

We'll break the review into CONS and PROS.

The CONS:

Filmation's animation.  There, I said it, okay?  Let's move on...

With seven minute running times, the stories are often too brief and many of them are hokey, even by Silver Age comic book standards, but others are good - even when formulaic.  Besides, some very good DC comic book stories were done in eight pages or so, in the Silver Age comic books of legendary editors Julius Schwartz and Mort Weisinger.

Though generally true to the source material, there are just a few too many divergences from the `60s comic books they represent.  None, however, are total deal-breakers, as were more common in Hanna-Barbera's later SUPER FRIENDS.

* Kid Flash has BLACK HAIR, instead of his usual RED.  It looks as if Filmation recycled their Aqualad model for this role.

* Green Lantern's Eskimo sidekick ""Pieface"" is absent (that could be a ""Pro""), but he is replaced with a blue-skinned, Spock-eared alien pal named Kyro.

* Green Lantern's masters, The Guardians of the Universe, are FLESH COLORED instead of blue-skinned!  I can only guess that they didn't want to link the powerful Guardians to the already blue-skinned Kyro.  But, why not just make Kyro another color and keep the blue-hued image of the Guardians ""as-is""?

* Hal Jordan appears to be the ONLY Green Lantern in this series.  One of the best things about the Green Lantern concept is that Hal was (and is) just one of a vast galactic peacekeeping force.  Probably done just for space / running time.

* In place of Hawkgirl (...who will be excellently portrayed in the 2000's WB JUSTICE LEAGUE series), Hawkman has a pet hawk named ""Screel""!  Now, maybe there was a ""Screel"" in the Silver Age comics, and maybe there wasn't.  But, if I were Hawkman - and ""was given the bird"" instead of a woman, I'd call it a raw deal!

Given this was the first time these characters were ever adapted to another media, not to mention one with the budgetary and time limitations this series had, there's nothing here that a typical fan can't deal with, if he or she puts things in the proper perspective.

There are EIGHTEEN CARTOONS on DC Comics Super Heroes - The Filmation Adventures vs. 36 for the earlier Filmation New Adventures of Superman set.  List price was 24.99 for DC Heroes vs. 26.99 for Superman.  So, we get 18 FEWER CARTOONS for just TWO DOLLARS LESS?  ...I'd say this is a ""Con"" in more ways than one!

The Justice League segment ""Target Earth"" is CUT - missing its title and writer's credit.

The PROS:

Outside of comic books, this is the first large-scale exposure the general public had to any of the secondary DC Comics heroes.  If you liked the Superman set, you'll probably like this... maybe even more so, for the diversity of characters!

Actual Silver Age DC Comics writer and editor George Kashdan was the predominant writer of these cartoons, with a small number going to well-known DC writer Bob Haney and TV animation writer Dennis Marks (both of whom would do fine work on Filmation's upcoming BATMAN series of 1968).  Renowned DC Comics editor Mort Weisinger was also a consultant to the series.

Given this, the characters accurately reflect their Silver Age identities and origins. Barry Allen is Flash, Hal Jordan is Green Lantern, Ray Palmer is The Atom, and Carter Hall is Hawkman.  Each cartoon has an opening segment that recaps that character's origin and powers - and displays the character's Silver Age LOGO as it appears on the comic book covers.

There's just enough (though not an overabundance, alas) Silver Age Comic Book fun to maintain the interest level of fans of this unique era of fantasy storytelling.  The Atom ""zapping"" alien roaches (Yuck!) by flipping them onto live wires, for instance.  And the shot of The Flash encased in green crystal by a mutated ant would have made a perfect cover image during the classic Julius Schwartz / Carmine Infantino / John Broome days of the Speedster's title.  Green Lantern recites his Oath, albeit in truncated form to accommodate the seven-minute running times.

There's even painfully authentic Silver Age Teen Titans dialogue:

""Pour it on, Speedy-O!  We've got to get to where the action is!""  And the unforgettable ""Cool it, Wonder Doll, here come the Marines!""

Hmmm... This could be a Pro AND a Con!

Warner made an effort to improve the packaging over the type I complained about in The New Adventures of Superman set review (Elsewhere on Amazon), where one disc of a two-disc set rests upon another.  With such packaging, you cannot handle or remove DISC TWO without first removing and handling DISC ONE.  There is always potential, however slight, for damage with packaging of this sort.  Here, they've put DISC ONE on a hinged holder and DISC TWO rests on the back, inside wall of the package.  An improvement, I'd say.

Also, in the packaging's favor - and since this was never an actual show and, therefore, could not be organized as such - the different DC Super Hero segments are arranged and grouped alphabetically.  Atom, Flash, and Green Lantern on Disc One and Hawkman, Justice League and Teen Titans on Disc Two.

The last of my props for packaging is for the simulation/recreation of the ""Silver Age and Prior"" circular DC Comics Logo, which is prominently featured as part of the box cover art.  A great way to indicate (for those in the know) what to expect in terms of the characters found therein.

There's only one Extra Feature, but it's a doozy!  ""Animation Maverick: The Lou Scheimer Story"", profiles the co-founder of Filmation Studios.  Mr. Scheimer contributes many recollections and anecdotes and is joined by his daughter Erika, his former partner Hal Sutherland, and luminaries who worked at Filmation like animator Darrell Mc Neil,  writer/producer Paul Dini of the various Warner Bros. animated series and the TV series LOST, and others.

Filmation is depicted as the last American animation training ground and a great place to have worked, with Scheimer leading the way, as it became (along with Hanna-Barbera) the dominant producer of Saturday Morning network fare - and established the market for new animation in weekday syndication later successfully mined by Disney and Warner Bros.

It was the last American animation studio to do everything ""in-house"", which helps earn its place in history.  Filmation's ending is rather sad, but the general feel of the piece is upbeat and very informative.  Personally, I've always been a Filmation Fan, but you can't help but have an entirely new appreciation for both the studio and Mr. Scheimer as a figure of animation history - and as a human being - after viewing this feature.

This documentary is a whopping 40 minutes long, as compared with the 15 minute ""Superman in '66"" feature on The New Adventures of Superman set.  I suppose that helps ease the pain of the price differential between the two sets... just not very much.

Deducting one star for the price point, I'd give DC Comics Super Heroes - The Filmation Adventures a very high recommendation, if you enjoyed the previous Filmation Superman or Aquaman DVD collections released in 2007, or are a fan of Classic Sat AM TV animation, comic books, DC Heroes, or the Silver Age of comic books in general!  ...Tell `em Screel and Kyro sent you!",1221350400,3,8036,4.840175953079179
3414538,3,B0018BDDFE,"A lot of memories flashed back when watching these cartoons. It's to bad those memories don't stand up as well as I remember but they are still a lot of fun to watch. Can't really say I enjoyed the stand alone hero episodes except for The Flash - To Catch a Blue Bolt. The Justice League and Teen Titans are the better of the episodes with more action and I thought the Teen Titans were the best animated. The funny thing Aquaman is not in any of the Justice League episodes even though he was included in the credits, but as a special bonus on each disc, the end credits to Aquaman were added. The feature on Lou Scheimer is excellant and helps explain the shoe-string budget animation. It's great to say that all filmation was 100% American made. It's unfortunate on how Filamtion had to close though. The Flash and Teen Titans were my favorite comics growing up and it was nice to see them once more in there original animation debuts.",1219968000,2,938,4.427745664739884
3414539,4,B0018BDDFE,"Four stars for this one, with the proviso that much of my rating is based on biased perspective. Man, I grew up on Filmation shows! More objectivity would probably garner this dvd set a three star rating from me. But, fellas, nostalgia's a powerful thing...

Way back in the stone age (that would be 1967), the Filmation group produced the Superman/Aquaman Hour, a CBS Saturday morning cartoon show and one of my tried-and-true favorites when I was a kid. But with so many menaces constantly itching to take over the Earth or just act all nefarious, it takes more than Superman or Aquaman to get the job done. Guest star stints in the form of  7-minute shorts were integrated into the hourly series, as Hawkman, Flash, Atom, and Green Lantern engaged in their own solo exploits. As the Justice League, these guys (with Superman) banded together to fend off cheesy alien attacks. And with assists from the Teen Titans and Superboy, the world got saved but plenty.

The way it worked with the Superman/Aquaman Hour, the first half hour belonged to the Man of Steel, with Aquaman dishing out his own two segments in the second half hour. Sandwiched in between would be the ""guest"" superhero cartoons, which were on rotation with the Superboy shorts. Anyway, with Aquaman's animated adventures already compiled in his own box set (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Aquaman-The-Complete-Collection-DC-Comics-Classic-Collection/dp/B000TSTEMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Aquaman - The Complete Collection (DC Comics Classic Collection)</a>), it didn't take long before a collection of the guest spots was released. DC SUPER HEROES: THE FILMATION ADVENTURES offers all 18 shorts starring these guest super-heroes, along with ""Animation Maverick: The Lou Scheimer Story,"" the outstanding and surprisingly emotional 40-minute documentary spotlighting Filmation founder Lou Scheimer and the formation and fall of the Filmation group. This is honestly a must-see bonus feature.

Now, if they'd only release the Superboy cartoons...

The brevity of these cartoons doesn't allow for much depth or development, in the plot or in the characters. The episodes are briskly paced and action-packed, but the stories are simplistic and campy, and certainly galaxies away from the polish and intricacy marked in today's animated shows. Also, back then, these cartoons were strictly targeted towards the younger kids, so nary a dark or controversial tone was found.

A lot of strange and silly foes here, from alien beetles to giant ants to dinosaur-like creatures. And plenty of mangy space aliens. So, yeah, the quality of villains is downright laughable. I did enjoy the Flash matching his speed against the otherworldly Blue Bolt (the Flash in blurry motion looks pretty cool), while the tiny Atom gets a thumbs up for being more hands-on with pummeling the heavies. Green Lantern's intergalactic adventures are okay. Wanna see a bird knock Green Lantern unconscious? That's in ""Sirena, Empress of Evil."" Sorry, but the Hawkman segments are as boring as I remember. Meanwhile, the main reason I got this dvd set was for the Justice League and especially the Teen Titans shorts. I'm a sucker for team-ups and, lest folks forget, this Justice League debuted on the small screen before the Super Friends. As far as the Titans are concerned, well, I've always been a fan of them. Besides, the pony-tailed Wonder Girl is smoking hot. Be aware, though, that Robin is absent from the Teen Titans and Aquaman, from the League, never mind that he's featured in the Justice League intro.

Naturally, the stiff animation suffers in comparison to today's sleeker, more dynamic standards. And the incessant use of stock footage doesn't help any. So why get this dvd set? Well, like I've said about these Filmation shows, the major draws are the nostalgia (for old fogies like me) and whatever curiosity or sense of history is felt by the younger generation(s). In a very real way, these animated shorts paved the way for Bruce Timm and the like.

What's that now? The Guardians of the Universe aren't really Caucasian? Green Lantern's ring is supposed to be ineffective against the color yellow? Hawkman's civilian identity Carter Hall is a museum curator, not a scientist? The colors of Kid Flash's outfit are reversed? Yes, there's a bunch of goofs that made its way into these cartoons. But what do you expect on a shoestring budget? The way I see it, all these goofs just add to the charm and quaintness. But, then again, nostalgia is a powerful thing.

Speaking of goofs, how cool would it be if Birdman really were a JLA member? I mean, seeing as he's already hogging a spot on the DVD title page and all.",1219622400,29,4750,5.174479166666667
3414540,3,B0018BDDFE,"Greetings, while I agree with most people that the DVD did not warrant a 2-disc release, I am still glad to have these. once thing I keep seeing however is people wanted ""more"", well the thing is there isn't any ""MORE"" these 18 shorts appeared in the middle of Superman/Aquaman cartoons, and this set comprises all of them. I think it would have been nice to have been added to the previous Filmation Superman or Aquaman releases, or have the price point cut in half, other than that the content in and of itself is comlpete.

The rest of the ""FILMATION"" produced DC material yet to see release on DVD are: a total of 34 Superboy short cartoons (currently in legal dispute but can be seen on Boomerang occasionally). 32 more Superman cartoons & 34 Batman episodes.

The remaining Hanna-Barbara ""Superfriends"" material yet to see release are: 1)The original Superfriends 16- 1 hour episodes (1973)
2)volume 2 of ""The All new Superfriends Hour"" (1977) (although this is claimed to be released now as a complete series, so those that bought volume 1 like myself are being forced to buy duplicate material)
3)Worlds Greatest Superfriends 9 1/2 hour epsiodes (1979)
4)The Superfriends Hour (1980-1982) 42 7-minute shorts
5)The ""LOST"" episodes (1983) 24 7-minute shorts that never originally aired in the U.S. but were shown on Cartoon Network & Boomerang years later (look for these on Youtube until WB releases them on DVD)",1219104000,7,1419,4.8838174273858925
3414541,5,B0018BDDFE,"The animation is cheesy, the stories are melodramatic, and there are lots of inconsistencies..... Still this collection is a must have for any true fan of the genre. Get it right away!",1219104000,2,184,4.78125
3414542,3,B0018BDDFE,"While I agree with all the reviews that this is great series of cartoons that is finally out on DVD by a major label, this is actually a product advisory to all the fans. Look carefully at the menu selection where Hawkman should be. Yes folks, that is Birdman in the menu selection! A mistake of this magnitude is totally inexcusable and makes me wonder if it was deliberate. Birdman has nothing to do with DC Comics or Filmation as he is a Hanna Barbera creation / property. I would like to hear the explanation for this colossal blunder. As much as I like these cartoons this inexcusable mistake on this disk only gets 3 stars from me.",1219017600,7,637,4.406779661016949
3414543,3,B0018BDDFE,"Each disc contains a little more than an hour's worth of episodes. The episodes and bonus features barely clock in a three hours. I don't how many episodes of each character there really were, but I'm sure it was much more than only 3 each. So I don't know if there are plans to release one giant set with all the episodes or individual sets for each character. The picture is reasonable but the sound for the episodes is very low. The bonus feature is loud by comparison, so don't forget to lower the volume. My personal favorite is The Justice League of America. A first time animated version of Pre-Super Friends. Which features Superman, Hawkman, The Flash, Green Latern, The Atom, and Aquaman in the opening title. But Aquaman does not appear in any of the three episodes. There isn't much in the way of character or plot development in any of the episodes in this set. But then again the target audience was small children and what can you do in just seven minutes. Watch them for nostalgia or get them for the kiddies. The back of the cover has a small announcement. Look for All-NEW SUPER FRIENDS HOUR: THE COMPLETE SERIES. I just bought volume one the same day as this. And now they tell me a complete series is coming. I'm thrilled and miffed at the same time.",1218931200,2,1270,4.478448275862069
3414544,5,B0018BDDFE,"This is an incredible collection of classic saturday morning cartoons.  I grew up in the 70s with the Super Friends, and it was a treat for me to find these cartoons that predate those shows. I love these even better than the Super Friends. I prefer that they're not as cheesy as the Super Friends were.  Ok, there's a little cheese, but nothing compared to the Wonder Twins cheese.  I found it amusing though that whoever put the DVD together apparently didn't know the difference between Hawkman and Birdman.  Don't worry, the cartoons actually have Hawkman, but the DVD menu shows a picture of Birdman along with the other heroes, even though Birdman is not in any of the episodes.

The only thing lacking was QUANTITY.  There are 18 episode with about 2 hours of content, I'd like more.  I'm not sure if more were produced or not. If so, roll them out, I'm dying for more!",1218844800,2,876,4.54140127388535

8269146,5,B0018BDDFE,"I am so thrilled with this DVD set. I have a two-year-old and a four-year-old that love superheroes, but I have found it really difficult to find superhero TV shows that are appropriate for young children (many are targeted for older elementary aged children or even adults).  I have not watched all of these episodes because we watched them out of order, but so far, I have watched almost all of them, and the only word I have heard that I didn't like was ""idiot"" (one time).  These shows are from the 60's, so they are not nearly as violent, and Wonder Girl's costume is also much more conservative than her more modern counterparts.  ;)  Most of the ""bad guys"" are aliens, monsters, or mad scientists, and they are usually put in prison at the end, or they change their ways.  None of the good guys have guns.  There are three episodes starring The Atom, three with The Flash, three with Green Lantern, three with Hawkman, three with the Justice League of America (pre-Batman, so it's The Atom, The Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman, and Superman), and three with Teen Titans (Speedy, Kid Flash, Wonder Girl, and Aqualad). Thanks for this great find Amazon!  :D",1467504000,2,1160,4.6568627450980395
