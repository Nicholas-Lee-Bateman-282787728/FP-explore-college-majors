205017,5,5552439538,"I bought this for a boy for his first birthday. Hes loves Kidsongs and his mother watched them when she was a kid. This was her favorite as well as her Mothers favorite because it was all music and very little talking. Her Mom would use it when her daughter was sick or it was bedtime and she was fussy.
But the mother couldn't find this Kidsong anywhere and so I bought it here. They said Matthew has watched it nonstop and even his Daddy loves it. Which is good because he usually hates hearing kids dvds over and over.
Its a very quiet and soothing dvd. Perfect for small children. Highly recomended by Matthew,Mom ,dad and Grandma too.",1201392000,,639,4.378151260504202
205018,5,5552439538,"Well for those who are trying to show this video to toddlers, I wouldn't recommend it because it is more for children ages 5-9. If you look at the video there are mostly children in the video that are of that age group instead of babies and toddlers. I watched this movie almost every other night back when I was 6,7, and 8 and I loved it. The songs were awesome, and it showed how parents should be patient and loving. My son is three years old and I plan on showing it to him in a year or so. I grew up on all of the kid songs and loved them. I also grew up on wee sing videos, wee wisdom, and Highlights Magazines. All were very educational, and fun. I hope you enjoy kidsongs!",1197763200,3,680,4.007352941176471

These are some yrs old. You can get them at Wal-Mart for only a dollar, but they only carry a few different ones. So, if your kids get hooked on them you still have to come to amazon to get them. Eleswhere they are 12.00 and up a copy. If they had up to day music, I would say they may be worth the 12.00",1194048000,,463,3.7346938775510203
205020,5,5552439538,For some reason my daughter 2 1/2 loves all of the kidsongs dvd and finding this one for night time was the best.  She watches it as her quiet time and I like the songs too.,1052006400,2,173,3.8055555555555554

205022,5,5552439538,I think there's a message in this.  When you want to express to someone that you're not happy with what they did the far more effective way to express your anger is to say something similar to what was said to Wendy and April after they'd broken the dish.  If you express your anger towards your children NOT using this method you could REALLY offend them & hurt them,1424476800,,367,4.304347826086956

205027,5,5552439538,"I absolutely enjoyed the Kids Songs that I recently purchased, Old MacDonalds Farm being my all time favorite.  I bought them for my Great Granddaughter Charlotte, and I remember all the wonderful moments I spent with her Mother watching these, we had
Very Silly Songs, Good Night and many more.  Watching these hold very special memories with my granddaughter Colleen.  I look forward to buying more for her daughter Charlotte.  When I received Old MacDonalds Farm, I couldn't wait to open the package and watch it.  I am 75 and I sat right down and sang along.

205028,5,5552439538,My granddaughters enjoy watching and listening to the kidsongs dvds.  Even my 5 mo. old will be content while I'm trying to make dinner. Great entertainment for younger kids.  Teaches them songs and rhythm.,1395619200,,206,5.029411764705882
205029,5,5552439538,I used to watch these videos as a child and I was very excited to find them on DVD for my own son. He was about one when I ordered the movie and he loved it and still watches the Kidsongs DVDs (he's 2 and 1/2 now). He likes to sing along. I like them because at the time they kept - and still do keep - his interest when regular kids movies (with little music) do not.,1392681600,,368,3.730769230769231
205030,1,5552439538,I'm sorry to say my 2 year old son won't watch this for more than 5 min. I watched some of it and it's very outdated. Maybe it's time for an updated version?,1384560000,,157,3.787878787878788
205031,5,5552439538,Best Night nite movie EVER.  Ridiculous for adults but the kids love it.  Second child in 12 years and it still does the trick!,1382486400,,127,4.25

205035,5,5552439538,"I had never heard of Kidsongs so I didn't know what to expect with this DVD.  To be honest, I was surprised the first time we watched it because it's straight out of the 80's and a little cheesy.  But, our 1yr old son loved it from day one and now we watch it about once a week before bedtime.  It helps him relax and he enjoys the songs.  It follows a few families as they help their kids prepare for bedtime.  Soon enough, my husband and I started singing along, too.  I'd recommend it to friends and I know we'll be watching this for years to come!",1352419200,,551,4.055555555555555
205036,5,5552439538,"Thank you for this video. I loved it when I was a kid. I had one and gave it to my step sister and she lost it. She had it for a few years before she lost it though and it worked wonders. I have been looking for one every since and now that I have it, I am going to transfer it to a DVD for my son. They have a newer version of this on DVD but, I am partial to the older one. Why fix what is not broken? You just don't realize what you have done by selling this instead of throwing it out like most would. Thank you. ( I know it maybe touch and go with the vhs tapes. I still have yet to see if it works, since I no longer own a VCR but keep the fingers crossed it works.)",1343606400,2,672,3.5472972972972974
205037,2,5552439538,the characters are scary to me but my 18mo grandson didn't seem to mind. he was swaying to the soft music but that kept getting interrupted by excited talking by the characters and then commercials for other kids songs dvds with more upbeat and louder music. weird.,1308614400,,265,4.659574468085107
