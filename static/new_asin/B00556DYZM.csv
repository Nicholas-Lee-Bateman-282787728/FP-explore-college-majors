It's truly an all-star jam session (filmed during his 1993 European tour) with Hampton and his group of jazz greats, including Clark Terry, Harry ""Sweets"" Edison, James Moody, Al Grey and the rhythm section featuring Junior Mance, Jimmy Woode, and Louie Bellson. This is jazz electric, including sizzling performances of ""Lester Leaps In,""  ""On the Sunny Side of the Street"" and ""St. James Infirmary,"" so white-hot that an approving Cab Calloway can be seen in the audience. Moody performs his signature tune ""Moody's Mood for Love,"" and there's a rare drumming ""duet"" with Hamp and Louie Bellson. It's jazz royalty at its finest, a fitting crown for a joint that's jumpin'.",1312675200,2,732,5.049586776859504
