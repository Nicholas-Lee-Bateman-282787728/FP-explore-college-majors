This particular DVD also includes, as a bonus, the videos from 'To Venus and Back' that she made, which makes it TRULY a Complete Set of her videos. This is a must for any fan of her music. I felt like I had a deeper understanding of the songs after watching these videos.",983923200,3,414,4.3896103896103895
7929090,5,B000050IKD,"It's too bad that this was never released, or even picked up by her new record company.

However, for those of you who may want to pick up the VHS, here is a fair warning: The VHS version may have really bad background noise throughout EVERY SINGLE SONG. It's like a buzz. I've returned my VHS to Amazon over and over again and every VHS is the same way. Maybe there are some out there that sound good, but just beware.

Best bet would take your VHS copy to a photo/digital place and have them convert it to DVD and take out that noise.",1105660800,,536,4.144230769230769
7929091,5,B000050IKD,"There is no way to watch this outstanding collection without having your remote nearby. Besides being a stunning beauty, Tori's music and lyrics are unrivaled. Highlights: ""Past The Mission"", I love the way these people seem so happy to be near her...""Spark"", shivers up the spine...""Talula"", this one makes me weak...watching her burn through the plastic to get at her beloved piano...If you don't buy this set, you are missing out on the very best of Tori...get it today!",1035417600,2,473,5.0
7929092,1,B000050IKD,"No more Atlantic and a non existant DVD when I finally got up to date with today's technology.  Tori is a BABE no matter what ""form"" she's in!  VHS, rewind, fast-forward, pause, here I come...",1024444800,6,192,4.457142857142857
7929093,1,B000050IKD,"Tori Amos parted ways with Atlantic before this item could be released.  Do NOT pre-order it, as there is absolutely no chance that it will come out in the near future.",1020902400,24,168,4.419354838709677
7929094,5,B000050IKD,According to the management of Tori Amos this DVD has been cancelled. There were no releases. ...,1015372800,46,97,4.764705882352941

7929096,5,B000050IKD,Tori videos are cool and its being rereleased with the videos from venus and back. We are now lucky to get them all. Wish I knew the exact date.,1004745600,2,144,4.0
7929097,5,B000050IKD,"I've been waiting for this dvd for too long, and I think it doesn't exist yet, I hope the release of this video can include the videos of, to venus and back and strange little girl, it will be wonderful if it contains some live material like the second cd of venus and back, still orbiting.",1004572800,2,290,4.196428571428571
7929098,5,B000050IKD,"Please do not be mislead by ""greatchroma""'s review;  This DVD has never been released.. It was scheduled, and bumped numerous times and is now (POSSIBLY) due out November 2001... hopefully/probably to include videos from Strange Little Girls as well now.",999302400,14,254,5.35
7929099,5,B000050IKD,"And we have to wait 9 years for it. Jan 1, 2010? Hmmm April Fools perhaps? Where did anyone come up with that date. I'd love to have this on DVD obviously, but this is too silly.",987465600,6,178,3.8378378378378377
