8630501,5,B00H7GEF8I,"I bought this because I love this series by Sokurov. This is the first time the collection has been available as a whole, and my first opportunity to see Taurus. However, I failed to notice that these DVDs are Region 2 encoded. I am unable to watch these discs on my equipment. I entered a request to return them, but the supplier has not responded.",1407456000,2,349,4.384615384615385
