after you see this you will understand my review",1413590400,4,235,4.065217391304348
6516979,4,B00LZS8Y22,"A movie that went straight to DVD, but is worth watching.  It has a nice twist to it.  The acting is solid.  If you like suspense and twists it is a good film.",1426550400,,159,3.757575757575758

6516983,4,B00LZS8Y22,"This movie is a mind-trip, formed by the director into an intellectual puzzle. The ending is clear, but it does require some thought to understand the it. The key to the movie is listening carefully in the first scene with a doctor in it, the one where the parents are first shown standing by the bed of their unmoving daughter. Remember what the doctor says as the conclusion unfolds, and then follow the sequence of the doctor's description of what happens to the mind when someone is ""locked in"" begins to play out....but in whose mind? Anyway, if you like the kind of movies that are meant to twist your brain into a knot, you'll probably like this one. There is intelligent use of cinematic techniques such as the use of light and shadow, of foreground and background, of barely slower-than-life motion and sometimes just barely quicker-than-life motion, flashbacks, and so on. Make sure when you sit down to watch it that you'll be undisturbed, because there are hints that you don't want to miss or you won't understand the psychological play. All in all, a good flick, maybe more interesting than actually entertaining.",1419465600,11,1127,4.814432989690721

6516985,4,B00LZS8Y22,"Extremely well acted - Ben Barnes steps outside the box on this one - and shines.  The entire ensemble is good.  Intriguing from Beginning to End - and perhaps I'm just not sharp enough - but the end - I don't get it - the imagery he (Ben) sees throughout this video is too contradictory to the conclusion, you might say ""oh, but it's obvious he..."".

Think about the entire movie, I don't think it is obvious...not really.  Rather than be mad, I'm curious to see what others think - and I don't think I've wasted my time watching this - which I usually feel when an ending leaves me confused, I'm just curious....",1417737600,,614,4.359649122807017
6516986,3,B00LZS8Y22,"It captured my interest but just when I understood the plot twist, I was hit with the ending, which threw me.
I read one of the other comments here that said the movie might have had a happy ending, which makes it clear that that person didn't get the ending, either.  I hate it when you don't get the ending!  I'd like to be in a chat room and speculate with others about it.  All I can say is that it is one of those movies that likes to play with your head.  If you like that kind of thing, this movie is for you.",1417651200,3,516,3.8857142857142857

8669200,3,B00LZS8Y22,"I gave it an okay solely because of Ben Barnes. Allow me a very brief explanation, I don't want to waste any of the precious time I have on earth for this drivel. Only 78 minutes long, it never got my attention, Ben loses control and we have a daughter in a coma and a wife who blames him? very typical plat and it moves slower than molasses in Vermont in January. Ben tries but can't be salvaged. Eliza Dushku? Who told her she was ever an actress, she was bad on Buffy, the Vampire Slayer ( I loved that show) I did 3 stars but seriously recommend you steer clear of the monotony!",1437091200,2,582,4.114035087719298
