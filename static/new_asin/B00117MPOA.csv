8240868,5,B00117MPOA,"This DVD delivers what it promises: a detailed breakdown of the Five Element Mother Fists. The instructor is a Chinese government conservationist in charge of preserving Xingyi as part of the national heritagebut for the viewer, that means he's had access to traditional Xingyi and its variations. He takes you step by step through each Mother Fistmetal, water, wood, fire, earthadding in transitions and a nice linked form. He pauses over each detail, going over it again and again so the beginner has access to each fist, and also to the linked form. I've watched the DVD over and over, following along and learning each fist one by one. I love it; it's definitely worth the money as the best introduction I've found to the Five Element Fist (the core of Xingyithe Twelve Animals are another story). Highly recommended.",1408060800,5,821,4.913669064748201
