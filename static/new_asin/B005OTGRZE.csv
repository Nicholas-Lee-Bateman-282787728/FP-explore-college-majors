4854570,5,B005OTGRZE,"The first time I saw this film was at the Tribeca Film Festival last April, where it went on to win Best Documentary Feature. From the first time I watched it, I felt inspired and uplifted. There was/is something about Alma and the journey she takes you on in this film. This story could have been told in several different ways. Just Google ""Bombay Beach, CA"" and you'll see it portrayed as a rundown place where the only people left are the ones who couldn't leave. But you don't witness a one-sided, narrow portrayal in Alma's film. While the main characters are struggling, the film does not glamorized their struggles. The dance sequences show us parts of their souls, their hopes and their dreams. It is beautiful and sensitive and human -- it is the most real documentary I've seen in a long time.

I've seen it five times already, which may seem excessive, but every time I am awed by the storytelling, whisked away by the melody and grounded in the lives of these characters in this place called Bombay Beach.",1322524800,2,1018,4.593406593406593
4854571,5,B005OTGRZE,"A wonderful movie.  Bombay Beach allows us to enter the world of the forgotten around the Salton Sea.  Like a fly on the wall, the director shows a segment of American society many will never see.  There is no judgement, no answers, but there is humanity and reality.  The use of music and dance is woven seamlessly into the piece.  Bombay Beach is often sad and gutwrenching, but ultimately uplifting, showing the spirit of each person to rise above what he or she has been dealt.",1322524800,5,481,4.546511627906977
4854572,5,B005OTGRZE,"I saw this film when it opened in LA and it is definitely one of my favorite doc's ever. Having experienced this area of the country first hand, the film really captures the hidden beauty that this forgotten desert has to offer. Shot 90% at sunset and magic hour, the beautiful cinematography and hybrid doc format makes watching Bombay Beach feel like walking through a dream. And who could possible complain about anything set to music by Beirut and Bob Dylan... too cool. A must have in my DVD collection. I can't wait to see it again.",1322524800,3,538,4.556701030927835
4854573,5,B005OTGRZE,"""Bombay Beach"" is that rare film that attempts to be something truly new.  And it succeeds.  The documentary genre is an important one, but it tends to take itself too seriously these days.  Whether it's the muckraking of Michael Moore or the We-Know-What's-Good-For-Your patronizing of Frontline, documentary films have become cliches that too often play it safe with conventional shooting, editing, and storytelling.  ""Bombay Beach"" is poetic and lyrical and all the things that naysayers will condemn it for being.  But, in my opinion, that's a good thing.  Some of the most meaningful non-fiction stories come in the form of poems and songs and dances.  This film deftly combines the best of many artistic genres into a compelling, stunning story of real people in a real town dealing with real problems.",1322524800,9,808,5.122137404580153
4854574,5,B005OTGRZE,"I was lucky enough to catch this film in it's limited release in theater and am so happy I did.  I wasn't sure what to expect and even if I had, I think I got much more than I ever could have asked for.  First off, this film is gorgeous, every shot in itself is a piece of art.  The film is shot with so much care for the individuals in it that immediately you are invested in their stories.  This is an unconventional documentary that has small bit of choreographed dance throughout that only pulls you deeper into the story and enhances the film in ways you definitely could not expect.  If you want to watch a film that breaks all the norms and delivers a beautiful story that will resonate with you long after it ends, I highly recommend Bombay Beach.  Easily the best doc I have seen of 2011.",1322438400,5,797,4.2105263157894735
4854575,1,B005OTGRZE,"I guess it's hard work to elicit meaningful insights. So instead, this filmmaker features numerous nonsensical choreographed segments of her documentary subjects dancing around with each other in their wrecked-up old town. I guess this is supposed to show lyricism in an underprivileged milieu, but really, it was just silly and boring. And the rest of the footage seemed curiously unfocused and superficial. A detailed examination of the life circumstances and problems of this community would have been interesting, but this film was more like a reality tv show with artistic pretensions.",1320624000,6,590,5.423913043478261
4854576,5,B005OTGRZE,"This won best doc at TRIBECA FILM FEST.  It's a stunning, warm and heartbreaking documentary that follows a group of unique people - each with their own dreams - living at The Salton Sea.  Wonderfully inventive, beautifully shot and a portrait of people you won't soon forget.  Really worth a watch.",1320278400,11,299,4.823529411764706

4854584,5,B005OTGRZE,"Surprisingly warmhearted view of the lives of a few people living in impoverished conditions in a town on the Salton Sea in California.

4854585,3,B005OTGRZE,"Somewhat enjoyable but be aware that it does not pertain to the Salton Sea at all.  I have spent considerable time there and wasn't expecting a documentary or anything but this was just a bit too detached to suit me.  Well done if you like the poetic, disconnected, skip around approach.  Despite the almost proximity, the almost story certainly didn't need to be infused with Slab City and Jesus Mountain.",1436486400,,406,4.771428571428571

4854594,5,B005OTGRZE,"Disturbing, yet beautiful film about life on the fringe of the American Dream. Initially we wondered if we were witnessing a variation on ""The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia,"" but soon realized this film was a deeper journey with its subjects and ultimately a powerful story of redemption, human dignity, and love. No spoilers here, but I found myself weeping when it was over and Googling for the whereabouts and welfare of CJ before the closing credits were through. Buy the DVD and enjoy the extras.",1405382400,,514,4.8522727272727275
4854595,4,B005OTGRZE,"The ugly truth is that although there is a lot of haunting natural and unnatural beauty at the Salton Sea, you won't find it at Bombay Beach.  This is a place that attracts people who are either in hiding, stranded by lack of money to leave, stuck with their messed-up families, or trapped  by some type of addiction or another. These are the kinds of real live people profiled and filmed in Bombay Beach.  Before I go further, I want to point out that Niland, Slab City, and Salvation Mountain are NOT part of the ugly Bombay Beach, but are in this movie, giving it a little more human interest.
My issue with this film more than anything is that it shows the state of the foster care system and how it fails kids.  Even though the mother of five in this documentary seems to be trying to do better since her release from prison for neglect, her husband is not, and the kids are still being neglected and raised in a horrible environment, with drugs and alcohol all around, and there is not much hope for their futures if they remain there. The youngest son's '""special needs"" take all the mother's time, and even if this wasn't the case,  these kids are all probably doomed.  This really sucks, because in southern California there are SO many people who are waiting to adopt and give kids a better life.  And then if and when they are finally removed from bad homes and the parents permanently, they have serious emotional problems. I hope that the proper authorities saw this movie and took some action for the kids in this family!!!  At the the en of 'Bombay Beach', the mother announces to the youngest kid that mommy has a baby in her belly!!! They ought to put the father BACK IN PRISON! He appears to be useless white trash with no redeeming value whatsoever, and if the mother had any common sense or self-worth, she would NOT be with him. I watched this weeks and weeks ago,  and I just cant get over this. I wish I could do something,  but I can't legally!!

What made me feel some happiness was one teenage boy living in Bombay Beach who saw a better future for himself, and did something about it. His family obviously wasn't as horrible as the previous one.
 There are a couple others profiled as well,  but I sure wish they would do a reality show about this place, in which children and others who deserve it are rescued after their profiles.  Kind of like 'Extreme Home Makeover', only with extreme lives!",1396656000,,2423,4.452488687782806
4854596,5,B005OTGRZE,"One of the most artful and inspiring documentaries of our time. Some reviews here state it didn't hold the viewer's attention. That's a fair claim, but in my opinion that has much more to do with the viewer and perhaps their lack of culture. I found this film very engaging through its consistent visual, poetic, and observational elements. It's not an instruction manual, like many documentaries. Very creative, and I think truly original and compelling. Well worth the experience!",1393977600,,482,5.113924050632911

4854598,1,B005OTGRZE,"You learn nothing about the Salton Sea area.  It is not about the sea and the communities, it is about a boring family that lives there.  For example, it takes you along on a doctors office visit in a nearby town.  Terribly boring.",1388016000,,231,4.325581395348837
4854599,1,B005OTGRZE,"Based on the title and description, I thought that this would be an informative documentary, but really it was one of the most pointless movies I have ever seen.  It gives about 30 seconds of history of the Salton Sea, and then goes into different character snapshots with absolutely no narration.  Viewers have no idea what is going on and about half of the people are impossible to understand.  The story gives no details as to why these people were selected, how big the community is, what life in Bombay Beach is like, etc.  Because everything is out of context, it is really hard to get into.  This is a selection of various stories - there isn't a specific theme and everything seems haphazard; I kept waiting for a main theme or a focused train of thought, but was sorely disappointed.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone - it is a waste of time.",1372636800,3,854,4.512987012987013
4854600,1,B005OTGRZE,"If I could return it I would, but it's an instant video. Exploiting this family is shameful. This family doesn't need a videographer poking about, they need to get a clue on how to help themselves. The best part of the movie were all the kids playing without video games or TV and the mock 'army scenes'. I use to have fun as a kid like that, we kept ourselves entertained. The parents in this movie are no more than grown up children. The medicine they were forcing on that little boy that made me want to heave. Be a good parent, be a good example don't think you can give a kid drugs and it's going to make him do good in school. Honestly it doesn't look like any of them had job, why aren't they home schooling these kids? This is the epitome of what is wrong in America. Child like parents who rely on the system and drugs to raise the children they make. I live about 90 miles from this area in CA and I know it's desolate and its economically depressed but there are jobs in El Centrol, there are jobs in San Diego, there are jobs in Palm Springs its hard to feel bad for a family that is so blantantly not interested in doing well. My advice to this family? Grow up and take responsibility.",1371772800,3,1198,4.168103448275862
4854601,3,B005OTGRZE,"All  Salton Sea documentaries are more inhabitant centric but this one more than most

sideline for those with interest in SS but not exactly what I was hoping for.",1360627200,3,254,4.5
4854602,2,B005OTGRZE,"There are very few dvd's I've watched that I could not finish and this was one of them.  I give the film high marks for visuals and technique but I found the film surreal and contrived.  I was particularly disappointed that the residents of the Salton Sea community were asked to ""perform"".  It's as if they are just following a script and the result is somewhat wooden and contrived.  The waltz scene made me uncomfortable.  I did appreciate, however, the director's intent to make the Salton Sea community a poetic commentary but I don't think the objective was obtained.",1359676800,2,573,4.747474747474747
4854603,3,B005OTGRZE,"Bombay Beach is an art-school cinema exercise / reality show about a marginal community of down-and-outers in the remote desert of the Salton Sea in California. These are the last residents of an ecological disaster zone and their lives are very odd. Nevertheless, I was bored by the film. Although the filmaker did seem to care about the people she followed, her film is static; no development, even for a documentary. In spite of being juiced up by a couple of music-video style song and dance numbers (I'm not making this up), it barely kept my attention. So why did it win New York film awards? Because New York art-jerks (they dress in black) enjoy discouraging stuff, the weirder the better, and even more they love the perception of America as a wasteland. It also didn't hurt that the Tribeca film clique just happen to be close friends with the director and her husband; it was their turn to get the award.

So I was glad that I checked out the Extras section of the DVD before giving up on the film. The brief section ""Where are they now?"" is worth more than the rest of the movie. We see that CJ, the black teen struggling to develop as an athlete, did indeed make it to a midwestern university on a football scholarship; heart warming. We see the filmaker Alma Har'el in real life (with flaming red hair of a shade not contemplated by the Creator) greeting the little boy Ben on a sponsored trip to the Tribeca Film Festival with sincere affection, and even better we learn that through visiting NYC Ben fortuitously receives better medical attention for his behavior difficulties than the bizarre over-medication he suffered at home. These are uplifting things, so much more real and interesting than the pretentious cinematography and faked up songs of the main presentation. Here is an example of a filmaker so overshadowed by what her ""we dress in black, we think in black"" art-jerk friends consider stylish that she censored the best human energy from her own movie. Says something about the conformity which governs the art world today.",1344124800,5,2054,4.737430167597766
4854604,1,B005OTGRZE,"An un-interesting collection of random scenes of a few underprivileged people living near the Salton Sea.  There is no narration - just some comments by the people in the film.

Unfortunately the director of this film does little more than enter the homes of a few residents, turn on the camera and hit record...with the occasional folk song to add some much needed flavor. Interesting camera shots aside...not even Bob Dylan's genius could save this film from a dull slumber. Woulda been cool as a 30min piece but instead dragged out into over an hour of hair-pulling lethargy. In the end the film doesn't reveal anything we didn't already know about the residents of Salton Sea: Poverty, abuse, dysfunction, criminality and overmedication. These things can become interesting if some kind of storyline or narrative is offered, but no one shows up to save the movie, much like the Salton Sea itself.",1488758400,,893,4.920529801324503
