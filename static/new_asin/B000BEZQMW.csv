8085805,4,B000BEZQMW,"Very strange movie, but very original. I enjoyed it. I was extremely shocked by the ending, and that doesn't happen to me very often. Watch it just to try and make sense of everything.",1332115200,4,184,4.4411764705882355
8085806,3,B000BEZQMW,"""EMR"" is a story of Adam who starts to suffer seizures presumably because of the drug he's taking for epilepsy. After these seizures he finds himself in strange places including other countries. He meets people who don't recognize him the next day, or he doesn't recognize those he met although they insist they've spent some time together. Adam comes to a conclusion it's a conspiracy initiated by the pharmaceutical company whose drug he's taking. Well, in short Adam's life turns into a nightmare, some paranoic delusion.
In this kind of movies where you can't tell reality from the dream everything usually depends on the ending and how creators of the film would manage it. In ""EMR"" the ending is rather interesting and unexpectable although I had a feeling I'd already seen this sort of intrigue in some other flick. So maybe it won't come as a surprise for you either, but I have to say ""EMR"" is rather entertaining to watch, it's pretty well done for a low-budget independent movie. Not sure that you have to buy it, better rent and make you own opinion. I thought it was fine to spend an evening with but don't expect some kind of a revelation - it's not ""Memento"" or anything like that.",1152489600,9,1196,4.672985781990521
