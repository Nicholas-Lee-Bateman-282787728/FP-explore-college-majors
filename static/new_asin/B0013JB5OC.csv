8290777,5,B0013JB5OC,"What great film the acting was good the pacing of the action was good the plot was fun. I love this film from concept to the end i still get giggles when i think back about parts of the film it seems like a basic idea but hell no one else thought to do it and i am so glad someone finally did, it was about time the hos took over. But as the film points out a ho can become a greedy pimp with a flick of a switch blade. i love this film.",1389830400,2,437,3.610526315789474

8290781,5,B0013JB5OC,"My review is for the DVD rather than the movie as I already have a review for this movie under the regular version rather than this deluxe version which you can read. I bought and liked Hookers In Revolt, but I made the mistake of lending it out and never got it back so I decided to buy back another copy for myself and spring the extra 4 bucks for the deluxe and would say it was well worth it. The movie itself is great and the movie is definitely enhanced with all the extras. The regular version comes with out-takes (very funny) and the trailer. This version has that along with commentary which adds insight to the movie, a funny featurette, interviews and auditions for the hookers, I mean actresses (just kidding). The great thing about the extras is that it's not just boring filler it's stuff that is entertaining and worth watching and at this price it's still cheaper than the average DVD with way more bang for the buck!",1205798400,,934,4.436046511627907
8290782,5,B0013JB5OC,"If you ever find yourself in situations were you're up late on a Friday or Saturday night itching to find something interesting to watch, then you need to get this movie in your DVD collection ASAP. It has every element you could want in a midnight movie. Camp - hookers having political speeches and starting a revolt against men and society in general for equal rights and union benefits. Sex - a ton of nudity and soft-core sex scenes the better ones come from a corrupt cop appropriately named Gene Simmons played by the director himself Sean Weathers. Violence - these hookers really get smacked around hard, but Gemini the main pimp in the movie seems to get the worst of things if he isn't getting beat up in a scene he's being robbed or made of. All of the hookers are pretty hot, but the one that takes the cake for me is Melissa Grimmond this Pam Grier looking chick that flashes her tits early on in the movie and believe me that scene alone is worth getting this movie for. This is a movie made to be watch several times, it's the type of flick you can just pop in when you're bored turn your brain off and enjoy the viewing. Something else to look for is the ""Animal Farm"" tie-in. It really clicked for me the 4th time I watched it, maybe because I was baked at the time but it was funny as hell once you make the connection with the book and the movie, pretty much scene for scene and character for character it follows the novel.",1204588800,11,1444,4.3125
