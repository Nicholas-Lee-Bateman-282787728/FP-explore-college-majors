8110876,5,B000CEGTZE,"I wrote a more extensive review for season one which applies to all the seasons, as they're all quite wonderful, fully engaging, with intelligent Brit (wry) humor, clever banter, endearing characters and interesting plots, which somehow seem believable, thanks to great comedic acting and top notch writing. I normally never watch sitcoms, but loved this. (And, this is totally accessible to a Yank audience--notice I wrote 'humor' not 'humour'. (This was one of the few Brit programs where accents were almost never an issue, never interfering with being immersed in the story.)",1522886400,,579,5.304347826086956
