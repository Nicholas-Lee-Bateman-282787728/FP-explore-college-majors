However since I just wasted $4 on the rental I wanted to give it every chance to redeem itself somehow, it did not! Bad acting and a slow moving plot made this movie a real pain to get through. Val Kilmer was the only asset this movie had going for it and it was wasted. Save your money on this one, if you don't you can't say you were not warned.",1331251200,24,441,4.0227272727272725

5002905,5,B006LL3W0W,I have to admit I am a huge Wyatt Earp fan. I have movies about Wyatt Earp all the way back to the 50's but in all honesty the best actor for playing Wyatt Earp was Kevin Costner. Now with that aside this was a very good movie a side of Wyatt Earp rarely if ever seen but yet it was justified. All in all a really good movie,1487548800,2,324,3.710144927536232

5002960,4,B006LL3W0W,"Dispite all the negitive reviews, this was an entertaining movie. I couldn't imagine Val Kilmer playing Wyatt Earp, but he only played an older Wyatt and did a good job. How ever he actually looks more like Virgil Earp. The younger Wyatt was a poor resembleance, you think they would have cast an actor closer to Wyatt's actual hight. But he's the shortest one of the bunch, looks funny. None of these young actors could ride a horse (bad acting). All in all I enjoyed the movie and would have given it 5 stars if the story was historically correct. But Hollywood doesn't make historically correct movies.

How could a guy that was so good in Lonesome Dove's Comanche Moon and Tombstone be so pitiful in all his other flicks.  The reality is Kilmer doesn't do hardly any acting as he narrates his memories to a interviewer of his times with some great lawmen (Hitchcock; Tilman; Bennett; and himself, an older Wyatt Earp)....story line does not match up with history was so ever....PATHETIC MOVIE;  I so missed on this one.",1384473600,2,513,4.677777777777778

5002963,1,B006LL3W0W,"Really I'm a huge Val Kilmer fan, however, this movie is not a ""B"" grade movie in fact I don't think there's a rating low enough. Val has his usual talents but the writers and producers should be shot on sight (hopefully not with the fake sounding guns in this ""movie""). It's a sad day when an actor of this magnitude stoops to do a flick like this one. Not to mention this history is almost completely made up. DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$.",1377907200,2,433,4.228915662650603

5002966,1,B006LL3W0W,"I saw a few reviews for this by curiosity got the better of me and I am a fan of Val Kilmer and the Wyatt Earp mythos.

The movie claims to be based on a true story. Well kind of. A woman named Dora was in fact killed. She was a singer known as the Nightingale of the west. But she was killed lying in bed next to her husband, in a second room of the mayor's home. There was no romantic entanglement with Earp as the movie portrays.
Bat Masterson was involved and in fact was the one who took down Kenedy (as it is spelled in the book Wyatt Earp Speaks). He was brought to trail and let go go, the jury finding it an accidental killing. Basically Daddy paid off the right people.

With all the great rue stories of Earp and Dodge city I don't understand the reasons for fictionalizing this so much. Also, the twist at the end other reviewers mention I saw coming very early on and I thought it was a cheap ploy to tug at heart strings. Kilmer was fine as Wyatt but it's hardly his best work. The rest of the acting was flat but that could be a result of a flat script. The film looks good and the locations are beautiful and in truth if they had told this story without evoking legendary names it might have been more fun. I understand these movies take liberties with facts but the liberties taken here were ridiculous and seemed to be done for cheap emotional reasons.

An OK mediocre western, a BAD Wyatt Earp film. If you want to see good Wyatt Earp on film get Tombstone, Sunset, Hour of The Gun or Gun Fight at the OK Corral.

And if you want some reality on Earp pick up the book Wyatt Earp Speaks. It's based on his actual words from interviews he did.",1368489600,2,1660,4.130030959752322

5002969,3,B006LL3W0W,"For all that this movie was...it wasn't ""Tombstone""! With that said Val Kilmer did an excellent job at portraying an aged Wyatt Earp, but then again, Val Kilmer is an Excellent actor.

I am a Wyatt Earp fan and I found this movie all in all to be lacking in many areas, 1st--Costuming was not good, modern hats were used, and even some hollywood gun rigs. Some actors should have been playing other roles, Unfortynately I paid for the DVD and should have rented it.",1358899200,,465,4.470588235294118

5002972,1,B006LL3W0W,"The movies Tombstone and Wyatt Earp have become classics. Regrettably, this low-budget ""Revenge"" production is just an attempt to capitalize on the Earp name.

5002985,1,B006LL3W0W,"Spelled = WYATT EARP'S REVENGE

B  A  D  Western.  The only point of interest is the fact Val Kilmer is, most likely, the only person to portray both Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday.  In this movie, his character as Wyatt Earp is little more than a bit part.  I did like the bit part Trace Adkins played and the colorful, but ever so small, portrayal of Doc Holiday by Wilson Bethal, who I was unfamiliar with, but nonetheless kicked it up a notch in his brief appearance.  Shawn Roberts played the younger Wyatt Earp, poorly.  He was upstaged by everyone in my opinion.  I actually felt bad for him.

Cannot, in good conscience, recommend this in any way.",1349827200,,651,4.432203389830509
5002986,2,B006LL3W0W,"""Wyatt Earp's Revenge"" is a very weak addition to the Earp legend in film. It centers around an early incident in Earp's life while he was a peace officer in Dodge City. The biggest name in the cast is Val Kilmer, and he plays Earp in older age (he originally had a star-turn as Doc Holiday in ""Tombstone,"" a much superior movie to this one). The story is slow moving and poorly written. The cinematography is very good. The horses seemed doped up like the horse used for kiddy rides. The performers in the film, save Kilmer and the fellow playing Doc Holiday, were chosen more for their looks than acting skills. Trace Adkins is particularly acting challenged, and should not quit his day job -- country music singing. The story centers on a group of top lawmen of the era: Wyatt Earp, Charlie Basset, Bill Tilghman, and Bat Masterson; but none of the actors portraying these figures has the gravitas to convince anyone they are master lawmen. In fact, they were constantly getting surprised, shot up, and captured at gunpoint by the bad guys, who seemed to be well on top of their game. If you want to see movies about Earp, get ""Tombstone,"" ""Wyatt Earp"" with Kevin Costner, or even ""My Darling Clementine"" with Henry Fonda (a film that had no relation to actual historical events).",1345248000,4,1284,4.635964912280702
5002987,1,B006LL3W0W,"Just an incredibly stupid story line, punctuated by bad acting except for Val Kilmer and lack of good directing.  Scenes that make no sense.  Dialogue straight out of a grade C movie.  The March of the Killer Tomatoes is probably as good as this piece of garbage.  Very disappointed in the movie.  Was hoping it would be a lot better.",1345161600,,334,4.5
5002988,1,B006LL3W0W,"Wow. This movie was a turkey. I've been collecting every film ever done on Wyatt Earp, and each one in its on way has a greatness to it. Until now. Truthfully, I only bought 'Revenge' to complete the collection. Why? I saw it coming... this video has turkey sign all over it:

1) It was made after 'Wyatt Earp' and 'Tombstone'. Those movies set the bar so high one would have to wonder why anyone would bother remaking the Earp story for quite a long time.

2) It has Val Kilmer playing Wyatt Earp. 'nuff said.

3) The title alone casts suspicion.

Once into the movie you notice all the things the other reviewers have commented on. Nice looking costumes... but they look like they just came off the rack. The titles stated the movie was based on a real event. Key word here is ""based on"", if even that much is true. There's way to much ""I-got-the-drop-on-you... no... I-got-the-drop-on-you... no I-got-the-drop-on-you... ad infinitum"". I also didn't like the way they handled the sexual assualt of the prairie wife. The whole scene with that family was stretched to the point that the story turned into a (bad) horror flick. But maybe I'm just a sissy.

What to watch instead of this gobbler? ANY other Wyatt Earp film. Even the 1983 made-for-TV Earp flick with Marie Osmond, 'I Married Wyatt Earp', is better than this. The later is a decent film.

As I write this review a new Earp film is in production starring Harrison Ford as Wyatt. Hmmm. Gotta go. I think I have a turkey in the oven to check on.",1344124800,5,1505,4.514705882352941

The cover (I bought it with great expectations) 2. It has an ending.

As far as the ending goes, I'm not sure if Val Kilmer died at the end or just fell asleep- it did look lke he was in pain- as I and my son were also.  I can't imagine a western being any worse- I'm sure there is one- I just haven't seen it.

It could have been good but Hollywood took too many liberties with the story. For example there was  a recurring anti-gun theme. One victims family would not allow guns in the house or teach the child how to use a gun. In 1878 Kansas? Really? There were still bands of Indians roaming the countryside killing settlers in the area at that time. Everyone including famers, ranch hands, and kids, where armed.",1331596800,,522,4.673913043478261
5003008,3,B006LL3W0W,"Based on the ""true story"" of the murder of Dora Hand (Fannie Keenan) by James ""Spike"" Kenedy.  Spike was the son of a wealthy Texas rancher Captain Mifflin Kenedy who, with Richard King, had founded the King Ranch, one of the largest sources of income for Dodge City and the rest of the territory.

The story is told to a newspaper reporter who has a special interest in hearing the story, from the perspective of Wyatt Earp in 1907.  This special interest is revealed at the end.

Finding opposition from Judge Hinkle to issue arrest warrants Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson and Charlie Bassett turn in their badges to go after the Kenedy Brothers. Along the way they pick up Bill Tilghman which creates one of the most famous posses of the Old West.

Spike Kenedy left a trail of bodies in his path as he headed home.  There were no redeeming qualities presented about this man--he was ruthless and took what he wanted.  Murder was a game to him.

Along the way they meet Doctor John Henry Holiday.  Wilson Bethel of Hart of Dixie plays the infamous dentist and lunger, who would become Wyatt Earp's best friend, with a certain finesse.  His character was the only one in the film that seemed gleefully happy.  The other actors were very stoic men.

Val Kilmer plays the laconic, aging legend in 1907 who gives a low-key but powerful performance as he relates the story from 1878.  There is a sadness about Wyatt which is given proper attention.

Diana DeGarmo of American Idol fame plays Dora Hand, the young actress who fell in love with Wyatt.  Wyatt's duty and his desire for a normal life are contrasted in his relationship with Dora.

This is a well-crafted film with good plot, story, cinematography and music.  It's enjoyable if you like this type of film. This would be a fine film to add to any Wyatt Earp collection if you are a fan.

Please keep in mind the ""true story"" element is stretched and rewritten.  Now for some criticisms and historical facts:

The DVD cover says, ""Based on the true story of a lawman gone renegade"".  As history accounts record this incident, they did not give up their badges.

Spike Kenedy was in love with Dora Hand. Spike was granted acquittal for the murder, but he never fully recovered from his wounds and died December 29, 1884 at the age of 29.  It is reported that Spike's father paid over $25,000 for this acquittal.

There is no historical evidence that Wyatt Earp and Dora Hand had a relationship.  Dora was a beautiful woman and had many men who appreciated her.",1331424000,,2512,4.591011235955056
5003009,1,B006LL3W0W,"Hands down, this the worst acted movie that I've ever seen, except for Val Kilmer. Why he associated himself with this fiasco is the unanswered question. The opening scene shows a supposed cowboy bad guy, who doesn't know how to ride a horse. The horse, by the way, is still in it's winter coat that has never seen a curry comb or brush. None of the main actors have any horse savvy and it's only the extras that know what they are doing. Then you have the young Wyatt, portrayed by a person who is knee high to a big fat judge. Wyatt was a tall(6 foot) individual. Whoever cast this movie needs to go back into training for another job. You get the idea, don't buy it unless you are really into throwing your money away.",1331337600,5,721,4.2700729927007295
5003010,2,B006LL3W0W,"John Ford said ""Do you want good history or a good movie?"" Well we get neither one here. The true story is so badly handled that it is barley recognizable. The boy playing Wyatt Earp always walks around with his hand on his gun, ready to draw it from a cross draw holster that I don't think Wyatt ever used.(Yes I mean ""boy"" since no one except Trace Adkins looks over 19) They continually get down from their horses on the right side, not the left, which in reality means the horses are well trained. Maybe the human actors should take lessons from them. The Bill Tilghman back story is wrong, and the whole thing looks like a High School production.",1331337600,,651,4.3884297520661155
5003011,2,B006LL3W0W,"As a native of Dodge City, KS where the events portrayed in the film took place I am pretty well versed on Dodge City history and especially in the true story of the accidental murder of Dora Hand.  Let me just say there is artistic liscence, and then there is blatant disregard for the facts for no apparent reason.  Many aspects of the film held very close to the facts and then there were some that were so far out of left field that I didn't understand why they bothered.  Most importantly was the ending.  Wyatt Earp was not responsible for the death of James Kenedy.  Bat Masterson is actually the one who put the bullet in his arm and it took two weeks to heal well enough for him to stand trial.  Miflin Kenedy bought his aquittal and Spike returned to Texas, married, but died partially as a result of his ill healed wounds in 1885.  Bill Tilgman, who is a legend in Kansas and Oklahoma was most certainly not raised by the Cheyenne, and Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday already knew each other in 1878.  In fact, at the time of Dora's death, Doc was practicing his dental trade in Dodge City with his office in Rm #24 of the Dodge House Hotel.  On the whole I thought the movie was a fun romp, though pretty badly acted and scripted throughout.  With lines like ""If we lose him, we'll never find him"" I simply cant give it any higher than two stars.  And the second star is only because the story is very near and dear to my heart and I hope that many people watch it and it inspires them to check out the real story.  Hopefully a better movie can be made of these events one day.",1331337600,51,1585,4.229235880398671
5003012,4,B006LL3W0W,"While Wyatt Earp's Revenge is not one of the best westerns in our collection it provides good acting and an interesting story (based on a true story).  Without giving away the ending, the story line centers around a much older Wyatt Earp who chooses to reveal an untold story about the past to a journalist in the hopes of setting the record straight.  I will see this movie again.  To the Wyatt Earp fans, this movie while not a five star rating, IMO rates better than a two star.",1331337600,5,481,4.382022471910112
5003013,5,B006LL3W0W,"Love a good western and I was interested in this one not only because of the story of Wyatt Earp,
But because it's a western and western movies are my hobby.  Take a review and for what it is and enjoy.
This was well written, well acted and directed. The story line has a great twist.
Remember today's westerns are modern and yesterdays are not.  They look different and sound different.
Watch this if you like the genre or not, It's something
I would watch again and recommend to anyone who likes a good story.
Getty Up it's 2012, I glad they're still making cowboy movies!",1331251200,16,574,4.40566037735849
