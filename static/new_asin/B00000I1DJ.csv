His brilliance in execution is the great asset of a traditional presentation.  Somehow his encouraging manner affects the  whole performance.  Most enchanting.",1291248000,,305,5.543478260869565
8278550,2,B00000I1DJ,"As ""Coppelia"" videos are rather difficult to find, I ordered this one and was sorely disappointed! Sets and costumes are paltry, the dancing is second-rate and the ""corps de ballet"" is anything but a unified group. The audience is quite noisy, screaming their approval - in Spanish - everytime Mr. Bujones leaps or turns. The coreography has been mutilated to adapt to the very small talents of both the leading lady and the soloists. Mr. Bujones'efforts are not enough to justify the purchase of this lamentable affair.
So sorry!",1067817600,5,530,4.966292134831461
