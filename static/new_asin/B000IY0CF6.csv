I seriously doubt comic books would even exist today if not for his groudbreaking collaborations with Jack kirby and Steve Ditko in the 1960's. However, the key word here is collaborations. This DVD is another example of where the uninformed are led to believe that Stan was the sole creator of Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, X-Men, the Hulk etc etc. The truth is he didn't. Stan led the Marvel charge in the 60's and was an incredible scripter who could make readers young and old feel like the books were written for them and they were part of the ""club"". Stan has been well compensated over the years and rightfully so....my only complaint is Stan had plenty of help from folks like Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko who never saw a fraction of the money that Stan saw even before he sued Marvel. If you want to see Stan portrayed as the victim and no mention of Kirby and Ditko as co-creators, you will enjoy this DVD...otherwise save your money.",1198627200,3,1010,4.51912568306011
