3447072,3,B001AD8FR6,"NOT TOO HAPPY WITH THIS. APPEARENTLY THIS IS AN ORIGANAL CUT OF THE FILM. NOT THE REMASTERED VERSION I WAS HOPING FOR. BEING SOMEWHAT VIDEO PRODUCTION IGNORANT, MAYBE THIS WAS DONE IN A FORMAT NOT QUITE PERFECTED YET AS THE INDIAN TOMB (PART 2) WAS AT THE TIME. ITS NICE TO HAVE, MAKING THIS 2-PART EPIC IN MY VID.

3447073,1,B001AD8FR6,"This was the worst movied I have ever purchased.  I have thrown it away.  The quality was worse then vhs.  The sound was terrible, the picture was terrible even on a hd tv.  Save your money.",1335312000,5,190,4.194444444444445
3447074,2,B001AD8FR6,"This is an old movie. It has not been cleaned up in any way, so the colors are very washed out, and the dirt and scratches are all there to see (over and over).  I am sure in 1958 it was probably a pretty good movie, but it has not aged well. I couldn't sit through the whole thing.",1332028800,7,282,3.7796610169491527
3447075,1,B001AD8FR6,"I don't do many reviews but I have to put in my 2c on this item so here I go, the quality is soo poor its un-watchable. I've seen clips of this movie on youtube that sparked my interest but these dvds that come from SINISTERCINEMA are of the Worst quality and almost killed my interest until I learned that the original films (the tiger of eschnapur+the indian tomb) were remastered into ""Fritz Langs INDIAN EPIC"". Google it and you will find it, its out of print but you can order it or find it on ebay as I did.
Again a good movie from 1959 that you should have in your collection but not this one.
Oh yes I forgot to mention that this dvd ""the journey to the lost city"" has almost all of dance seens cut out.",1302393600,27,711,4.085714285714285
3447076,4,B001AD8FR6,"Fritz Lang's penultimate effort is not his best, but is worth watching for Debra Paget's dance in the second film, arguably the most erotic dance ever committed to film.  To me, Debra was the hottest actress of the 50s, bar none.  To see her gyrating with just a few strategically placed bits of material is heaven.  It's not a short sequence, either.  The print is clean and sharp, the color bright as could be wished.",1292371200,2,419,4.546666666666667
3447077,4,B001AD8FR6,"If you like Debra Paget you will like this movie. She also played in the Ten Commandaments. I didn't know she was

3447078,1,B001AD8FR6,"The Video is not clear, and some part of the show is missing. I have this movie many years ago on video. Disappointed in this purchase.",1278288000,13,135,4.230769230769231
3447079,1,B001AD8FR6,"I have about 4000 DVDs and have seen bad transfers in my life. This DVD is one of the worst. The color is washed away, it is fogy and it is in 1.33:1 but should be in 2.35:1. I just started to watch the film and don't know if I will watch any more. So if you care for picture quality (like I do) then stay away from this DVD. I'm writing this short review because I wish someone had warned me about the transfer before I bought it.",1260489600,73,431,3.853932584269663
3447080,4,B001AD8FR6,"JOURNEY TO THE LOST CITY still has me trying to figure out where the lost city was and whether or not anyone in the film really finds it.

This film, originally released by American International and shown in movie theatres in the late 1950s, is a severely truncated version of Fritz Lang's original lengthy opus. I remember seeing this short version in my father's small-town movie theatre on a double bill with another AIP programmer. Clearly, this was not another entry in the typical double-feature made-for-drive-in theatres for the horny teens who barely watched the screen anyway, like THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN and THE CAT WOMAN or BLOOD OF DRACULA and HOW TO MAKE A MONSTER. This was clearly an acquired product,  unlike others produced on a shoe-string budget. Nor, however, was it particularly satisfying. On DVD, unfortunately, taken from a faded 16 millimeter print, it is still unsatisfying.

One can argue for the full version made in the German language by the great master of such film noir greats as THE BIG HEAT and such weird westerns as RANCHO NOTORIOUS, but his long version, available on two disks, seems to be much ado about very little. Despite its length, the original is not an epic. It is a stretched-out effort with very little substance behind it -- sort of a short story made long. JOURNEY TO THE LOST CITY is, on the other hand, too short. Too much was removed from Lang's original, so perhaps something in between these two versions would be more desirable. At least the original was rendered in clear crisp Technicolor images and, on DVD, looks great. It also includes both of Debra Paget's dance numbers, one of which is performed in a costume that is unbelievably erotic. This short version omits the racier of her two dances, and this is unfortunate. Including it in this film might have given the work a needed boast to rescue it from the turgid footage that remains.

Paul Hubschimdt makes a stalwart hero, able to defeat a tiger in his white dinner jacket. Most American viewers may remember him as the villain in the Michael Caine - Harry Palmer film FUNERAL IN BERLIN, and he is well-cast here as the love interest of the incredibly beautiful Ms. Paget, one of the more stunning beauties to ever appear in American or foreign films. Both stars carry this film because the others, even the second male lead who lusts for her delectable torso, are given relatively little to do.

I ordered this film from Amazon because I was curious to revisit the version that I had seen as a boy. Amazon, to its credit, did admit that this film might be unacceptable to some viewers because of its 16mm origin, so I have no one to blame for the washed-out colors that hamper this DVD product. Unfortunately, such films as ROME AGAINST ROME, originally released in theatres as WAR OF THE ZOMBIES, suffer, as well, from their humble origins that have not maintained their integrity over the years.

Perhaps a better version of this severely edited version of Lang's over-long original will eventually become available. Until then, look for Lang's original. At least it has Paget's dance routine performed in her incredibly racy costume, if one can call the strategically placed stick-on patches a costume.",1249344000,37,3228,4.807207207207207

3447087,4,B001AD8FR6,"This is an interesting film for many reasons but it is not a particularly good nor entertaining film. Fritz Lang is one of my favorite directors. He was a genius at pacing when the form was a silent film, as in Spies.

The use of sound and color required changes in approach that become evident when comparing this film to one of his silents. The film was shot on location in India. Today, with CGI and more advanced equipment, the reality of the location would be more intense, more real than real.

So while it is not a great film, it is worth seeing if you have seen some of his silent masterpieces and compare. The point being that silent black and white films really are different from ones with color and sound.",1464566400,,717,4.383458646616542

3447093,2,B001AD8FR6,"I bought this specifically for the snake charming scene, which is a classic Debra Paget dance. I'd seen it on line and wanted to see the whole movie. Not only is the scene cut out of this Fritz Lang classic, but the sound and video quality are quite poor. The worst thing is, having seen the dance scene on line, I recognized the robe over her dance costume from a 3 second snip preceded be a reference as to why the dance scene is important to the plot, makes the story confusing.

Honestly, even if this was restored and digitally remastered with the missing scene, this movie has a lot of ""why is in here?"" and ""why would they even bother doing that?"" moments, and was never going to get more than 3.5 or 4 starts from me.",1424822400,8,725,4.253623188405797

3447097,2,B001AD8FR6,What would have been a good film is ruined by its poor condition. This movie is in desperate need of digital remastering to restore color and clarity. In addition the movie seems to have been edited (or should I say butchered) to shorten the original longer version - there are a number of glaring discontinuities between scenes. My advice is don't waste your money on this copy.,1391731200,,379,4.6716417910447765

8276845,2,B001AD8FR6,"Sinister Cinema has an interesting collection of movies, ""Journey to the Lost City"" is one of them. The prices for them are not justified either from the Sinister Cinema website or through Amazon. I have now collected three DVD's that are provided by Sinister Cinema. All three have poor image quality. Regarding contrast, the intermediate shades of light and dark that help give detail are lost. On sharpness, where there should be distinct clear lines the image is a bit blurred. Though two of my Sinister Cinema movies such as this one being reviewed, are described as being filmed in Technicolor they are little better than Black & White, though you can tell from time to time that they were originally filmed in color. It is NOT likely that I will get any more DVD's from Sinister Cinema.",1519344000,,793,4.753623188405797
