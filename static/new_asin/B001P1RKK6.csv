3737083,5,B001P1RKK6,An amazing true story.  Helps build your faith.  Richard Wurmbrand's life shows what the Holy Spirit will do when you lay all that you have on the line.

3737085,5,B001P1RKK6,"Very inspiring!
The power of God's Love overpowering the contradiction of evil!
Especially his testimony sitting on the stone bed which his torturers used to beat him.",1262476800,3,167,5.222222222222222
3737086,5,B001P1RKK6,"A brief, and occasionally jaw dropping, (50min DVD) biography of the founders of 'Voice of the Martyrs'.  It includes commentary from their son Mihai.  A professional secular Jewish family who decidedly chose to serve Christ just before WWII and the subsequent Communist takeover of Eastern Europe.  God's faithfulness and power is on display in these lives.  -  God bless...",1260921600,5,375,5.288135593220339
8331825,5,B001P1RKK6,Hard to watch at times but so inspiring to see how Christ can change and transform people. The Wurmbrands are true Christian heros. Well done video. Thank you!,1522281600,,159,4.714285714285714

8331827,2,B001P1RKK6,I returned this one...just not what I thought it would be.  Not bad...but not that good.,1490572800,,88,4.5
8331828,5,B001P1RKK6,This story of the founders of 'Voice of the Martyr' is very sobering.  We take it for granted how fortunate we are in the United States while true Christians around the world are suffering for the cause of Christ.  Very encouraging film about the lives of the Wurmbrands and worth watching with friends and family.,1440460800,,314,4.6909090909090905

8331830,5,B001P1RKK6,"A very thoughtful documentary of the life of two faithful servants of the Lord and the Romanian people, easily understandable for all age groups. Both coming from Jewish heritage and having such great success in worldly matters, their conversion to their Christian faith must have been sincere.  We would all respect the tough choices they had to make.  And, not giving up, they kept with it all the way until things turned around.  They leave a great legacy from which we can all benefit.  These are two lives well worth studying.",1412812800,,531,4.802197802197802

8331832,5,B001P1RKK6,"Always, the testimonies of Pastor and Sister Wurmbrand are a very sober reminder of what real persecution is.  Thankful for this film and their testimony.  A must read primer for the modern believer:  Tortured for Christ",1397260800,,220,5.055555555555555
8331833,5,B001P1RKK6,"Very good documentary.  I did not even know about the Wurmbrands.  Interestingly, after watching this video and the fact that they founded Voice of the Martyrs (VOM); their son has gone public in his disapproval of VOM and the fact that the money is not going to the persecuted Christians and they have refused to investigate the suicide of the man that ran VOM.  He committed suicide when he learned that he was going to be investigated for the molestation of a child.  The son of the Wurmbrands is endeavoring to warn others of the wrong direction this once wonderful establishment has taken.  He is asking people to stop donating to this unworthy cause for they have forsaken their purpose.",1395878400,9,693,4.741666666666666
8331834,5,B001P1RKK6,Wonderful documentary.  Joy on suffering in real time.  An amazing and inspiring story that Christ lives today!  God bless them.,1385424000,,128,5.3
