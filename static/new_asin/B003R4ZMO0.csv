4178054,5,B003R4ZMO0,"No, this isn't the original show.  If you compare the two and you are looking for the newer version to be a duplicate of the original show, you may be disappointed.

However, if you try to enjoy the new Five-O as a completely new show (with some similarities to the original), it's one of the most exciting new shows out there (IMHO) - along with Blue Bloods.

The scenery is great (plenty of nice shots of Hawaii, the cast works well together.  I enjoy the banter between Danny and Steve.  The plots have mostly been excellent and well executed.  Looking forward to the DVD release of this new show.",1291507200,56,600,4.458715596330276
4178055,5,B003R4ZMO0,"The show is amazing...I am not a regular TV show watcher. I normally watch TV shows for the first time on DVD but I have watched this show, every episode, from the beginning. Alex O'Loughlin is HOT and his role for Steve McGarrett is perfect! And the perfect complement to his character is Scott Caan's Danno. Their bantering and sarcasm back and forth is so enjoyable and elevates the show to a whole new level. I have never seen the original Hawaii Five-O episodes so I am not able to compare the new version with the old but I, for one, cannot wait for each week's episode and am anxiously waiting for the DVD seasons to be released. Aloha!",1290297600,15,643,4.411764705882353
4178056,2,B003R4ZMO0,"I loved Moonlight and Alex O'Loughlin, and I think Grace Park and Daniel Dae Kim are hot. But since the beginning I thought the script was really poorly written and amateurish and the characters were unconvincing. But I stuck with it... till today. I had to turn off the TV in the middle of the show because I simply couldn't take the whiny over-acting of Scott Caan anymore. He may get away with it if he's good looking, but he's short, has bad hair and bad posture and zero charisma. So bye-bye Hawaii.",1289174400,13,504,4.43010752688172
4178057,5,B003R4ZMO0,"To start off, Hawaii 5-0 has a stellar cast:  Alex O'Loughlin, who is perfect as Steve McGarrett,  Scott Caan is great as Danno, Daniel Dae Kim is wonderful as Chin Ho and Grace Park is excellent as Kono.

I was so excited about this show when I first heard about it, and it exceeded my expectations.  What more could you want?  It has the perfect blend of drama and humor, a brilliant cast who are not only talented but just as enjoyable to look at as the beautiful Hawaiian setting they are in - and the writing is smart, fun and witty.

I love the way CBS has been advertising the show as a ""reboot"", not a ""remake"", as so many people had been calling it.  The whole story is new, the characters are new, and the writers are quickly letting you see the lives of the characters.  You not only have an exciting case filled with lots of excitement and drama each week, but you are drawn into what is going on in the lives of the four characters and it leaves you wanting to know more about them and where they came from.
Hawaii 5-0 is sleek, sexy and exciting, and it is no wonder that it is the highest rated new drama on TV.  I don't think it will take long before it is the highest rated drama on TV period.

Congratulations to Alex O'Loughlin for finally getting the success and recognition he deserves so much with this new show.  I will be tuning in to watch each week - and then watching again after I have recorded it.  Now I can't wait for the DVD to come out for the first season, and I hope it has lots of extras.  Hawaii 5-0 is going to be on for many years to come, and I will be buying each new DVD as they come out.",1286755200,126,1630,4.088050314465409
4178058,1,B003R4ZMO0,"Though its been on for a short time so far, I could barely get through the first showing.  I enjoyed Alex O'loughlin in, ""Moonlight"", but as Steve McGarret, never. Why do these shows have to star so many young people?  Every character was replaced with young people excluding the Governor's part.  What's wrong with putting some wise older characters in these shows.  So what if the Governor in this show is an older woman in charge, Steve McGarret's character is what made the show. Scott Caan as Danny is annoying.  He needs a shave and his attire is tacky and unprofessional looking as some of the other cast members are. No F.B.I. agent that I've been around would dress and look this way.

A little explosive action in a show is fine, but don't over power it with too much special effects. Is this what's going to hold this show together?  Give me a good story line to follow. Yes, I am a true fan of the original Hawaii Five-O series.  Some things should remain classic and unchanged.

For the comment about Jack Lord being pleased with this show if he were alive, maybe not.  According to what I've read about him and his demanding perfection of the Hawaii Five-O series, somethings may not have been to his liking.",1286064000,24,1222,4.538812785388128
4178059,5,B003R4ZMO0,"Awesome rendition of the Hawaii Five-O franchise. Wonderfully faithful to the original story with its own unique flavor. Absolutely stunning visual effect and military-style action sequences that nail the Jack Lord vision. For those youngsters that did not grow up watching the Jack Lord episodes, Jack was dictatorily dogmatic in demanding top notch performances from the series' actors. This new show, albeit in its first season, has the potential to go the distance if the writers maintain the highest quality story lines that kept the interest of the original series for eleven seasons. Five stars, hands down. Well done to the production crew. Don't cut the production budget and keep the intro music as the authentic hallmark that it currently is. Kudos to the executive that rejected the first musical score and demanded the iconic Five-O theme music. Jack Lord would be proud. James MacArthur is proud. Oooooh-RAA.",1285027200,6,922,5.236486486486487

Great series from the very beginning.  Good chemistry between the actors from the start.

4178114,5,B003R4ZMO0,"This excellent remake of the original CBS crime drama ""Hawaii Five-O"" features Alex O'Loughlin as Commander Steve McGarrett, the head of the Hawaiian State Police Special Task Force known as Hawaii Five-O, along with Scott Caan portraying his loyal sidekick, Detective Danny Williams. This first season of ""Hawaii Five-O"" depicts the exploits of Commander Steve McGarrett, Detective Danny Williams, and the other members of the Special Task Force, as they valiantly battle the criminal element in the state of Hawaii. ""Hawaii Five-O"" is characterized by superb writing, acting, and development of its story lines, and the various crime capers are interesting and engaging. In addition, the beautiful Hawaiian scenery is absolutely spectacular. There is a strong camaraderie among the members of the Hawaii Five-O Special Task Force, and the conclusion of each episode with a team dinner on the beach serves to highlight their dedication to the overall mission, and to each other. This remake of ""Hawaii Five-O"" is a supremely entertaining crime drama, and I enthusiastically give it a five-star rating, along with my highest recommendation.",1485648000,,1140,5.446327683615819

4178116,5,B003R4ZMO0,"This is a police/mystery show plain and simple.  What's not plain and simple are the characters themselves.  Each one has their own story and motives for being part of Five-O and this drives both their lives and the season.  Five-O season one is a must if you want to get to know the characters, but it is also just plain fun at times as McGarrett and Danny learn to be partners despite their vast differences.  And there is always those great shots of Hawaii.  I highly recommend this series/season.
Warning: This may not be appropriate for younger children, due to the violence and death scattered throughout.  Also there's a fair bit of skin, both because its Hawaii and because sometimes it's used to distract potential targets.",1485388800,,732,4.76984126984127

4178239,5,B003R4ZMO0,"This was a pleasant surprise. The original series ran for twelve seasons and was the longest running cop show of the time. At its heart was Jack Lord as McGarrett, who took over the reign's when the series creator died around the fifth season. His no-nonsense approach to fighting crime was enhanced by tight shows that demanded your attention. Even after all these years, the shows still hold up and engage my attention.

The new series, which has been running for a number of years at this point, provides a great backstory that is missing from the original series. The producers were smart to keep the theme song and mimic to a fascinating degree, the intro sequence of the original. The cinematography is outstanding and in many cases, could double for postcard shots that a typical of the Island paradise. Even more important is the fact that the plight of the natives and their traditions are presented in a respectful manner.

The cast of characters have the same names as the first season of the original series and the famous (missing for a major part of the original series' first season) line, ""Book him, Danno"" starts with the first episode. The original no nonsense approach is replaced by stronger character development, something that is common to today's television series.

The show is high-octane all the way and it isn't unusual to find the same kind of ""tight"" story telling that was featured in the original. It is also very violent at times, but doesn't dwell on the violence or feature it. It is rock-solid in suspense and action and most of the stories are somewhat unpredictable. The Hawaiian setting offers a real change of story potential from most of today's cop shows and is used effectively.

I highly recommend this for anyone who likes a good mystery cop show that has well-developed characters that often have a sense of humor that doesn't turn into slapstick comedy.

And watching this new iteration of the show does not diminish the intense entertainment value of the original series.",1452038400,7,2019,4.840579710144928

It's a must-see. Great acting, great stories, beautiful photography and directing, and a tour of Oahu, Hawaii. Who could ask for more?",1433203200,,312,4.305084745762712

4178291,5,B003R4ZMO0,"Hawai'i is my spiritual and physical home.  The views of the aina...and the kai, are spectacular and occasionally leave me in tears...home sickness, gratitude for the time spent in that place of so many faces, all touched, warmed, shaped by a cultural that is at once Polynesian, cosmopolitan and glabal.  The visuals alone, for a homesick kamaaina are a gift.  The language used to title each episode and the care given to the values of the people and the place is another gift.  Some of the plots are a bit thin, others overdrawn, but...it's Hawai'i, home of my body, spirit and heart.  The re-drawing of the characters is tasty: Jack Lord's cool, urbanity becomes Alex O'Loughlin's man of action and passion, Scott Caan makes a sand burr out of James MacArthur's dutiful and agreeable Dan'o, and the shape-shifting of Chin Ho from chubby Chinese policeman into a lean, Kung fu warrior but most of all turning the humble, sometimes bumbling Kono into a passionate surfing, law and order vixen, completes a blending of a detective show sited in paradise, into a global girdling drama that pounds out echoes Tom Selleck's Magnum, P.I., the original 5-0, 007 and more.  Scripts that comment on American adventures or mis-adventures in Afghanistan, Cambodia and Vietnam beat drums of humanitarianism, patriotism and compassion.",1431820800,,1325,5.055045871559633

4178348,3,B003R4ZMO0,"Most of the episodes are done well and are entertaining to a large degree.  I have enjoyed watching them all.  However, because I am the biggest fan of the original tv show, starring Jack Lord, I miss Lord's acting approach, and all the other actors, and the pace of the stories.  This new version of Hawaii Five-O is like a bunch of bulls let loose in a China shop- non-stop unrealistic action, people and things blown to bits.  I think it appeals well to a sixteen year old; and not to adults who would appreciate good detective work and action, but not
inconceivable action scenes.  Also, no credit is given to Jack Lord, either in the opening or the closing of an episode- but credit is given to the creator of the original show.  It wouldn't have succeeded at all without Jack Lord.  And to see these marginal policemen take on the names of the original cast is a disgrace.",1423872000,,878,4.45
4178349,1,B003R4ZMO0,"What a wretched remake. The acting promises to someday attain ""wooden"" status, with the exception of Grace Park's work.",1423008000,,119,5.315789473684211

4178363,5,B003R4ZMO0,"Hawaii Five-O is of course a reboot of the 1970s/1980s series.  It is a blend of action, drama, and mystery.  Like many of the shows in its genre, it is part case of the week and part ongoing storylines.  The case of the week aspect keeps it from getting too repetitive and the longer, ongoing stories are spaced out throughout the season that it does not give too much away too soon.

The base of the main ongoing story is the murder of Steve McGarret's father (played by Alex O'Loughlin) who comes to Hawaii to catch the man who murdered his father.  This sets up a very intricate story (some of which is played out by the end of the season, but much of which remains unresolved into season 2), that involves much more than McGarett initially suspects.  He ends up as the head of an elite task force comprised of the detective on his father's murder investigation Danny Williams (played by Scott Caan), an ousted, disgraced former detective Chin Ho (played by Daniel Dae Kim) and rookie cop Kono (played by Grace Park).  The team basically has authority from the governor to do whatever they want/need to solve crimes.

The thing that makes the show work is the cast has (or seems to have at any rate) very good chemistry together.  The McGarret/Danno relationship which is really the backbone of the show works because Caan and O'Loughlin play off each other very well.  Overall the show is well written and acted and considering the cast is somewhat ensemble, especially with the recurring characters, it does a good job balancing all the character's stories and not just focusing on any one person.

As far as extras for those who get the DVDs or Blu Ray, there are commentary tracks on select episodes and deleted scenes for most of the episodes.  On the final disc you get the behind the scenes material, TV spots promoting the show, a clip from the comic-con panel announcing the show, a gag reel, and featurettes on the stunts, a tour of Hawaii, the theme song, and the legacy of the original series.  There is also a short gag reel.  All in all, a lot there for those who like going through the extras.  The show looks and sounds great on Blu Ray for those who get that set.

Overall the show found its footing pretty quickly.  You can tell the found a formula for the series, and at least through the first season stuck to it pretty well. There are some pretty big cliffhangers going into season 2 that has the fates of the characters in limbo, and like I said above not everything in the main story arc is resolved.  If you like shows in the genre it is definitely worth checking out.",1421539200,,2596,4.498933901918977

4178409,4,B003R4ZMO0,Good show.,1412467200,,10,4.5
4178410,5,B003R4ZMO0,"On  September 20, 2010, 42 years to the day that the original Hawaii Five-O police procedural  TV show premiered on CBS, an all-new version (with the slightly altered title of of Hawaii Five-0)  made its debut, also on CBS. Now, over the years, I've developed a healthy skepticism for remakes of older, ""classic"" TV shows. They have usually proven themselves poor imitations of the originals. I figured this remake of Hawaii Five-O would very likely be no different, although I was (begrudgingly) willing to give it the benefit of the doubt... for the time being.

As it turns out, the all-new Hawaii Five-0 is much better than I expected.  The new show is still built on Leonard Freeman's original premise of a four-person team of investigators, appointed by the governor of Hawaii, that investigates that states toughest and most high profile crimes. Steve McGarrett, (now played by Alex O'Loughlin) leads the team. McGarrett is once again ably assisted by Danny Williams (Scott Caan), Chin Ho Kelly (Daniel Dae Kim), and Kona Kalakaua (Grace Park).

All four of the lead characters in Hawaii Five-0 are much more fully developed and complex than they were in the original show. We learn that Steve McGarrett is the son of Jack McGarrett, a former Honolulu police officer who is murdered by terrorists. Danny Williams is a transplanted New Jersey cop who follows his now remarried ex-wife and young daughter to Hawaii so that he can maintain his relationship with his daughter. Chin Ho Kelly now has a secret in his past that he wants to keep hidden; and Kona Kalakaua  is now a beautiful young female rookie cop who's also a champion surfer.

From the outset, Hawaii Five-0 Season 1 makes one thing abundantly clear: this ain't your parents Hawaii Five-O.  Todays Steve McGarrett is no longer a straight-laced, buttoned-down ""top cop"" with slicked-back hair and an immaculately tailored suit. Now he's a modern day ""action hero"" with attitude to spare, dressed in cargo pants, pullover shirts, and athletic shoes. He and Danny share an especially strong chemistry thats readily apparent from their light-hearted and often humorous squabbling. The scripts delve more deeply into the personal lives of every character, making the show a finely balanced combination of character-driven crime drama and technology-driven police procedural.

The original Hawaii Five-O is still a great police drama, even though it has not aged particularly well. The new Hawaii Five-0, now (as of this writing) entering its seventh season on CBS,  takes the very best that its predecessor had to offer - an original concept, excellent story lines, and Hawaii's magnificent scenery - and transfers them all into a show with great appeal for 21st century viewers. Highly recommended.

4178420,2,B003R4ZMO0,It is so sad that today's so called TV moguls cannot come up with original names or ideas for TV shows any more. The Jack Lord series opened up the doors for filming in the island state and this would have been a great show if they had called it something else. There will always be comparisons with the original which was in a class of its own. Is it any wonder that Australia canned the series and I cannot even find it on tv listings in the USA mainland. The only place I see it so popular is where else but Hawaii.  I lived in the Islands for 20 + years so see no reason to watch this remake. I may be labelled an oldie but I have and prefer to watch the Jack Lord series.,1409702400,,676,3.934306569343066

Maybe it's the annoying Scott Cann with his, ""Hey I'm from Jersey, I'm tough and super cool""!! character, he's always overacting, he's the official Jersey  actor and it's annoying, Then the other characters just aren't believable unless our bureaucracies have been taken over by a bunch of second rate whiners and hot heads with cool electronic gizmos. The big computer table is the star of the show. The kidnapping scenarios of let me pay the ransom parents and let us handle it police is formulaic and predictable. Spoiler Alert - watch and see who the biggest guest star is and BONGO! that's the bad guy. There just isn't any surprises or originality, the episodes are all reruns of previous cop show plots. I guess ""Polynesian Paralysis"" takes a toll on writers, directors and actors just like it infects tourist?

Season 1 and Season 2. Know this is out of context, but if you love the show as much as I did, it won't matter cause you'll be so
consumed by the shows you are watching. My hat is off to the writer(s) and cast members cause it is a Number 1 Show - no matter which season you watch. It seems to get better with each new season! Love this show!!!",1397433600,,605,3.9672131147540983

This, the first season, may be the best of the four broadcast to date- and is about the only ""cop show"" I make any effort to watch. Most TV series remakes are bad- this one is not.
I missed a few episodes when it was broadcast- now I can catch up.

The camera work is great, the writing not bad and the producers really seem to put a lot of effort into production. The episode notes are inside the cover meaning you'll either have to remove it or 2 of the DVDs to read them (you'll get broadcast date and title- in Hawaiian & English- along with a couple of lines of episode descriptionyou might or might not be told who guest starred). You'll also get a few, too few, words about whatever extras are on each disc. The extras are among the best I've ever seen on a series set with the usual ""gag reel"" and deleted scenes and a few featurettes about the show (I had no idea so much of some of the action stuff was ""faked"" in a computer). Grace Park's Hawaiian tour is the only worthless extra in the set- you'll learn almost nothing.

Good set, I hope the others are as good.",1396569600,2,1314,4.149019607843138

4178515,5,B003R4ZMO0,"As a fan viewer of police shows, I've watched a lot of JAG and NCIS and CSI. As a fan of hot, sexy males solving mysterious situations, I've also enjoyed a great deal of Supernatural and Sherlock. I'm also a devoted fan to the original series. Which meant I was reluctant to see the revamp. But one episode and I was hooked. This new Hawaii Five-0 is the chocolate cream!
It's hard to come up with a crime-solving story that hasn't been done a hundred times already by now. Which makes it a good thing that Hawaii Five-0 doesn't try to be super-original in that respect. The new show seems to be balancing human responses to bad situations (and not always coming out on the legal side) with justifying means to the end (again, not always using legal means). There's a good deal of drama without going all Gray's Anatomy.
But quite possibly the best thing isn't the plots or the action (which is literally explosive). It's the interaction between Danny ""Danno"" Williams and Steve McGarrett. Alex's acting leaves a little to be desired but his partner more than makes up for it. The two of them manage to fight together like an old married couple (something that various characters love to point out) yet still work together flawlessly. It's hilarious to watch, and even better to follow along as it evolves into a friendship and brotherhood that leaves the fangirls shrieking with delight.",1389916800,,1388,4.692622950819672

It ended its twelve-year run in 1980, and three decades later CBS brought the series back as a 'reboot.'  This DVD set contains all 24 episodes of the first season of the new version of the series originally broadcast from September 2010 to May 2011.

In this version of the show Steve McGarrett is a former Navy Seal played by Alex O'Loughlin.  After his father is murdered, Steve is joined on the Five-0 team by Danny Williams (Scott Caan), Chin Ho Kelly (Daniel Dae Kim), and Kono Kalakaua (Grace Park).  There is great rapport, banter, and humor between Steve and Danny, and the series portrays side issues like Danny's relationship with his ex and battles for custody of his daughter.  The team is based in Honolulu and solves the crimes of murder, kidnapping, gang war, jail break, robbery, and piracy, and also chases arch-villain Wo Fat (Mark Dacascos).

The series incorporates high tech into the forensics that the team uses to solve crimes, and the writing in these episodes is great--it is so tightly written that if you let your mind wander for even a minute or two you can lose track of important parts of the storyline.  In many series today men are portrayed as buffoons, but the new ""Hawaii Five-0"" is old school in that the lead character embodies the traditional masculine traits of toughness, courage, competence, honor, and decisiveness.  The music is also good, and recognizable guest stars this season include Greg Germann and Rick Springfield.  Season One even has a great finale/cliffhanger.

Special features on this DVD set include promos, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and features on the show's theme song, on life in Hawaii, on comparisons to the original show, and on the production of the series.

It seems that most of the time (we can all&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/think-of-examples/dp/B0080GTA0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">think of examples</a>), when a network remakes a show it is far inferior to the original version.  But with its great writing, technology, action, and superb cinematography of Hawaii, this new iteration of ""Hawaii Five-0"" is even a little bit better than its predecessor, great as it was.  One thing both versions have in common, though, is the best theme song in television history.",1388620800,3,2538,5.524547803617571

Surprisingly very enjoyable.....I'm hooked.
The opening music (a little faster than before, I think) and scenes are great; someone selected very good images that depict the real Hawaii quite accurately, but with good entertainment value.
Alex O'Loughlin is a very good actor and I enjoy his and Scott Caan's relationship on the show.
Hawaii is unquestionably beautiful, but this show is doing something to enhance the colors and making it look greener and bluer than it really is.  For the most part, I appreciate how much prettier they are making it look, but every once in a while they'll overdo it and it just looks fake.",1388188800,,767,4.7669172932330826

4178543,5,B003R4ZMO0,"Not watching much tv, I saw the short promo for this show the same week it premiered in 2010.  When they showed McGarrett say ""Book 'em Danno"", I thought, 'oh jeez, I can't believe they're coming up with some pretty boy jerks just so they can pose and say that line'.  I gleefully tuned in that Monday ready to laugh the show out of the water.  Five minutes later I was saying 'Whoa, now that's an opening!' and I was hooked.  Glad to say I was wrong about it all.  The lead is perfect, very convincing as a navy seal.  Caan strikes a perfect balance, Kim is super-cool and Park is an interesting take.  I never miss it.",1381363200,,620,4.203389830508475

4178546,4,B003R4ZMO0,"Yes, it is the TV show, which since we are on a weird time zone is best watched on DVD. My only complaint is that the chapters are labeled in Hawaiian, which makes it near impossible for us howlies to remember which they've already seen.",1380067200,,237,4.288888888888889

Steve McGarrett is the closest we have to a true American Hero, since the days of Harmon Rabb on JAG ... !  Steve & Danno are a modern day ""Butch & Sundance"", and are fun to follow.  I've been catching up with the back episodes on TNT, but truly needed a source to see the first month of shows from back in 2010.  And I found 'em HERE...  With the new season starting in 10 days on CBS, I'll be using Amazon / TNT to bring me up to speed for years 1-3 !  Yes, I am DOWN with HAWAII FIVE-0 !!",1379289600,,650,3.9236641221374047

4178565,5,B003R4ZMO0,"Having jumped into HI - 5-O in the middle of their second season, we absolutely had to watch all of season 1 - of course.  The characters and actors blend really well together - the team of writers continuously touch on various issues.  Although we now laugh and say - ""Hmmm....it doesn't market Hawaii very well - since there's always a murder - kinda like it's a mini-LA!"", lol - but, we know it's entertainment.  The on-location shots of the islands are gorgeous and we all hope one day to visit.  Each episode from day one, has carried into the next episode - and we also like how future episodes use previous story lines and characters - which goes to show how many scenarios are interlinked!  Makes for great writing.  We can't wait for the new season to start!",1376179200,,767,4.482014388489208
4178566,5,B003R4ZMO0,this is pure escapist fun to watch - there are of course technical flaws and some can be jaw dropping but overall for entertainment it's worth it,1375833600,,145,4.407407407407407
4178567,4,B003R4ZMO0,"Hawaii Five-0 is a visually appealing show.  It is fast moving and reasonably exciting.  The trouble is, we've seen it all before.  The show and its characters seem very much like their counterparts on the various CSI show, NCIS, and all the rest.  They're all a bunch of pretty boys who just aren't convincing in the roles they play.  The big difference between the original and the current version is that originally there was a mystery involved in most episodes that held your attention.  The bad guys were frequently thoroughly despicable and the viewers  were glad when McGarrett would put 'em away with his ""book 'em, Danno.""  The new show is just all slam bang action.  I guess tv producers think we're all too dumbed down to appreciate a mystery. I submit that it was a big mistake to redo the characters of the original Five-O.  The new version might have worked better if the personnel were portrayed as a new generation of people in the positions of McGarrett et al.  But these guys just don't make it as tough guys, and I don't care about gentle cops.  I find Alex O'Laughlin  a wimpy version of the Five-0 boss.  Scott Caan is a pale copy of his father and the others are not in the least impressive.  It also bugs me for them to chase bad guys in Chevy Cameros and Harley Springer street cruisers as in shades of Miami Vice and Nash Bridges.  There's a long tradition of TV cops; Joe Friday, Dan Matthews,  Theo Kojak, and yes Steve McGarrett. In my opinion the new Hawaii Five-0 force aren't in that league.  I was never a great fan of Jack Lord, but he made Hawaii Five-O work",1374796800,,1592,4.46875

4178578,3,B003R4ZMO0,"LIKE most people, I am rather fond of the original
So I am concerned when they 'reboot' a series

Question 1: they found the original session musicians to play the theme song - so it could be like the original.
If the new is going to be like the original, then why bother re-recording it?

Question 2: so Lt Commander Steve McG is the original Steve (Jack Lord) McG's son
Then how come the Chin Ho Kelly isn't older?

Until the 3rd (of 6) DVDs, the show was Ok
Then they started this 'Lt Commander McG's mother was blown up (or not)' nonsense

As the stand alone new show, this would have gotten a 4
But as a reboot, nah.

And to make things worse, Seasons II and III don't get better.",1370476800,,685,4.159090909090909

I love the relationship between the four main cast members, especially the banter between Alex O'Loughlin and Scott Caan. (Some of their ""carguments"", as they have come to be called, are classic!) It's been fun to see the rebirth of the show and a lot of the original characters from Five-O. But this is the 21st Century Hawaii Five-0, so don't expect it to be a replica of the original. The new Steve McGarrett is much more hands on than the McGarrett made famous by Jack Lord -- mostly thanks to hunky Aussie Alex O'Loughlin and his Navy Seal persona. Scott Caan brings a fresh face to the character of Danny ""Danno"" Williams, who is much more outspoken than the original and willing to disagree with the Boss (O'Loughlin). Daniel Dae Kim as Chin Ho and Grace Park as Kono fit perfectly into their roles as well. And I especially love any scence graced by Taylor Wiley as Kamekona! Hawaii Five-0 is packed with fast-paced storylines, plenty of action, beautiful scenery and a fun glimpse into the personal lives of the four stars. (It was mentioned on one of the DVD extras that the only thing that may have really been missing from the original was a real peek into the personal lives of the cast, and I completely agree. I love seeing these four great characters away from Five-0.) IMHO this is one of the best shows on television!

4178730,5,B003R4ZMO0,"Even in paradise there are snakes in the grass. When Navy SEAL Lt. Commander Steve McGarrett is lured back home to O'ahu in pursuit of his father's murder, he's tapped by the governor to head up a newly established task force assigned to take on Hawaii's nastiest crimes. Never mind that McGarrett, at first, only goes along with it because it expedites his ongoing investigation. McGarrett's persistent digging into his father's murder proves to be a recurring sub-plot that threads thru all of Season One. But this hyper reimagining of HAWAII FIVE-O is so much more than about one man's obsession.

Still, one decider is that the governor promises McGarrett full immunity and no red tape. McGarrett, you'll quickly observe, is like a bull in a china shop. It's what makes him fun. He's an intense, unapologetic man of action even more so than he's an investigator. Episodes are often fueled by McGarrett's wild, headstrong impulses, and this, along with his dynamic physicality, adds an electrifying element that's very much absent from the other, more plodding police procedurals. It's a good thing the Commander runs into his new partner, Danny Williams. Danny, six months out of Jersey PD and flaunting that abrasive, smart-alecky Jersey 'tude, is actually the more by-the-book detective. Danny (or ""Danno"") and McGarrett immediately get on like pork sausage and a Vegan.

Apart from the unforgettable, driving theme song and ""Book 'em, Danno!"" and Jack Lord's glorious hair and that it originated a slang word for ""cop,"" I don't remember much about the original series. I certainly don't remember the original McGarrett and Danno sharing this same tremendous chemistry. In every episode, this McGarrett and Danno engage in awesome banter and bickering and mocking, lots and lots of mocking. The scenes between Alex O'Loughlin and Scott Caan are what truly sells the show for me. They are so much fun and dictate the tone of the show. But, no worries, HAWAII FIVE-O trots out other elements that compel you to tune in like an addict. And I don't just mean the snark and the swagger and the laugh-out-loud funny.

Daniel Dae Kim (LOST) and Grace Park (BATTLESTAR GALACTICA) make fantastic additions to the show, respectively playing disgraced cop Chin Ho Kelly and sexy ex-pro surfer and now rookie cop (and Chin Ho's cousin) Kono Kalakaua. Yeah, Kono is now a girl. Just like Boomer is now a girl. I love that the show explores Chin Ho and Kono's family ties and personal lives. In fact, the personal lives of all four characters comprise huge chunks of the episodes, something that didn't happen in the original series. And I'm a sucker for Danno's sweet interactions with his young daughter Monkey- er, Gracie. But, for Chin Ho Kelly, yeah, it's a pretty painful backstory.

HAWAII FIVE-O is in large part forensics and police procedural. What elevates it above the rest of its genre competition is that it's an explosive action-adventure series as well; McGarrett tends to shoot first, ask questions later, and then shoot some more. Each episode also doubles as a lush travelogue reel of Hawaii, with each exterior shot serving as an inviting postcard. I wouldn't at all be surprised if tourism has shot up in the Aloha State since HAWAII FIVE-0 premiered. The gorgeous backdrops lend a vibrancy, inject an energy. You could say the state of Hawaii is the show's fifth major character.

Although this incarnation separates itself from the original and rapidly constructs its own mythology, familiar names and themes crop up. Looming large is the presence of Wo Fat (Mark Dacascos), a remorseless crime lord who once more becomes the show's big bad. And don't be surprised if actors from the original show surface here.

There's always that striking disconnect that hits you whenever you watch shady stuff going down in bright, sun-drenched environs. The Five-O unit routinely navigates paradise's underbelly, tangles with the more exotic sorts of crooks (high seas pirates, Samoan gangs, the Yakuza). There's that one case the Five-O had to solve while under the duress of an impending tsunami (in ""Kai E'e""). And how about the charred corpse that was uncovered in the fire pit of a luau (""Mana'o"")? ""Ke kinohi"" is a volatile episode which provides impetus to McGarrett's ongoing investigation of his father's murder. ""E Malama"" isolates and showcases each member of the Five-O unit even as a federal witness, hunted by the cartel, races against the clock to testify at the courthouse. As a comic book fan, I always appreciate these shows' stabs at featuring comic cons, and ""Ne Me'e Laua Na Paio"" is a good 'un. ""Oia'i'o"" is the highly charged season finale that sends shockwaves rippling thru the Five-O team.

This show has raked in such good buzz that A-list guest stars have flocked in. James Marsters (Spike from BUFFY and ANGEL), Kevin Sorbo, Dane Cook, Masi Oka (HEROES), Rick Springfield, and a surprisingly good Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs are only a few of the recognizable names. And so why don't you catch the wave as well, brah? In what other detective show can you eyeball crimesolvers solving crimes in shorts and flip flops? If you're tired of the old forensics cops and robbers programming, give this a try. Thomas Magnum would want you to. So would his mustache. So would Jack Lord's hair. And Scott Caan's mousse.

In short: the 4 main characters were great both individually and how they played together, the supporting characters were great, I liked the action, stories and settings.  See other reviews for details as to why this show is so good.

But I have a question.  The characters in the show often say the temperature is in the mid 90's, even said it was 110 degrees one time.  This sounded off so I just checked average Honolulu summer temps and they don't get above the upper 80's.  Does anyone have an idea why the writers would put in this seemingly glaring factual error?

4178738,5,B003R4ZMO0,"It seems like whenever anyone in the film or TV industry decides to remake a popular series they always get it wrong. They either try to spoof the original poorly or create a show that is similar in name only. But when they do get it right it's a sight to behold. Such is the case with HAWAII FIVE-O.

The original classic series in the 60s and into the 70s was known first off by its guitar twanging theme song performed by The Ventures. With scenes of the islands, surfers and hula girls, we were introduced to a special task force the fought crime in Hawaii. Led by Steve McGarret (played by Jack Lord), the show was an instant hit that lasted past the 10 year mark.

The new series uses the same names and locations but twist them just enough to bring them into the 21st century. Hawaii has changed quite a bit since the sixties and it shows just in the opening credits which continue to use the same toe tapping theme song. So how do we change characters?

To begin with McGarrett (Alex O'Loughlin) is now a Special Forces commander whose transporting the brother of an arms dealer named Hesse (James Marsters). As Hesse's men attempt to snatch the brother back, the transport goes wrong, the prisoner dies and Hesse kills Steve's father. Returning for the funeral and to catch the arms dealer still in the islands, he's offered the job of creating a special law enforcement branch in Hawaii with no holds barred, put together by the governor (Jean Smart). He turns her down and sets out on his own to seek revenge.

The officer in charge of the investigation is Danny ""Danno"" Williams (Scott Caan). A Jersey cop transplanted to the islands to be near his daughter (moved there by his ex) he's not at all an islander. The two meet as Steve checks out the crime scene of his father's murder and Danny catches him there. After finding a few more pieces of the puzzle, Steve agrees to the governor's request and now the pair forms an unlikely team.

As they track down leads a few other characters join them. Chin Ho Kelly (Daniel Dae Kim) is someone Steve knew from the past, a man his father trusted. He's on the outs with the Hawaiian police department because they suspected him of stealing money. A simple denial is all Steve needs to trust him. When the time comes for an undercover female agent, Chin brings in his cousin Kono Kalaua (Grace Park). A week from graduating the police academy, but saddled with her cousin's legacy, she jumps at the chance to be part of the team.

With pieces of the puzzle coming together and the team assembled, they go out in search of Hesse to bring him to justice. Keep in mind, we're just talking about the pilot here. The rest of the series is just as exciting and fast paced.

The rapport between the characters is crucial to what makes this series work as well as it does. They joke with one another, they get angry at each other, but in the end they work together and work well. Each actor brings something special to their roles as part of the team. O'Loughlin is big on action, Caan the family man who cares about his friends, Kim has ties to most of the community and Park is the fresh face who's taking it all in. If the actors could not meet the requirements of the stories being told, it would all fall apart. But each does an amazing job.

In other episodes the team takes on Serbian mobsters, gangs connecting to the mainland, foreign ambassadors and someone fans of the original show will be glad to hear about. McGarrett has an arch foe in this series carried from the original in Wo Fat (Mark Dacascos), an criminal genius who appears in various episodes, or at least his name, from the get go. By the first season's conclusion, he turns the world of this team around in a cliff hanger that leaves you guessing.

4178739,5,B003R4ZMO0,"I started watching Hawaii 5-0 one afternoon on CBS.com when my 18 month old was sick and wouldn't let me put him down, so I sat with him in bed and watched most of season 2.  I than went and bought season 1 on DVD and have enjoyed it very much.  I never have seen the origional series since it was on long before I was born, but this seems to be a very well made show, with decent plots.  I like that there is a undertone in each episode about Steve's past but that it doesn't consume each episode.  I like learning a little more about his past each episode.
The banter between Danny and Steve is silly, funny and very east coast dry.
I just mailed my husband season 1 for his birthday(which he is spending in Afghanistan) and he is a huge fan of the origonal series.  I will update when he sees it.

4178785,5,B003R4ZMO0,This is a superb series with amazing photography.  I was a fanatic about the original series and was concerned that this would be a poor follow on...but how wrong I was.,1324598400,,169,4.451612903225806
4178786,5,B003R4ZMO0,"In the grand scheme of things, I've always had a soft spot for reboots.  There is something about redoing a series or a series of movies (Batman) that allows for a different take...in TV, it's become the ""fleshing out"" of a storyline that draws me.  The one example that I can clearly point to is ""Battlestar Gallactica"".  I have never denied my dislike of the old series, its cheesy special effects...and that dislike of the old series has likely enhanced my fondness for the reimaged version we had in the last decade.  But BSG 2003 was incredibly topical for the time--uncomfortably so at points, given how it was mirroring the Iraq conflict, its views of torture, and the way the series delved into religion.
  The reboot of ""Hawaii Five-0"" isn't meant to be a series with deep undertones, obviously.  In both it's versions, the series has had one constant co-star--the islands and the scenery that make up the 50th state.  The beaches, the mountains, the stunning view of Honolulu and the rural areas...those sights haven't changed.  But the difference--as we have seen with many series that had their origins in the late 1960s and early 1970s and have been brought back to the screen in the 21st century--is the much more complete history we get in the reboots.
  I fully admit that I could either take or leave the old version of ""Five-0"".  I loved the theme song--there isn't a person who has heard that track who does NOT love that music.  But I was never a great fan of that cast--Jack Lord and friends seemed bland, almost wooden at times; and as with all television at the time, we were dropped into the middle of the Five-0 unit's world at the beginning of the series.
  So it only figured that this generation's ""Hawaii Five-0"" would introduce us to the unit from its origins, with a fuller accounting of the characters and the tale.  Which is why we meet Steve McGarrett as a Navy SEAL, born on ""The Big Island"", sent away from Hawaii for his safety by his police officer father, only to be drawn back after his father is murdered by the brother of a terrorist McGarrett has captured...which leads into the larger mystery of his father, and a long-term investigation he was conducting.  Accepting a ""gloves-off"" position from the Governor of the state, McGarrett puts together a group of ""Untouchables""; allowed to go after the bad guys as they see fit, and HOW they see fit.
  The casting for this series has been excellent, even if CBS influenced part of it.  The Eye has a habit of, when they latch onto a male star they feel has ""it"", they WILL find something for that actor. There have been some pretty good examples of that philosophy--Mark Harmon had ""Chicago Hope"" before ""NCIS"".  Simon Baker had ""The Guardian"" and was part of the short-lived ""Smith"" ensemble before ""The Mentalist"".  David Caruso had ""Michael Hayes"" before ""CSI Miami"".  Alex O'Laughlin had been the Apple of the execs at The Eye for four years.  They introduced the Aussie to America as the vampire dectective Mick St. John in ""Moonlight"" in 2007, as one of the doctors of ""Three Rivers"" in 2009, and as the male lead in the CBS Productions' movie ""The Back-Up Plan"" also in 2009.  Suffice it to say that someone at CBS knew they had SOMETHING with O'Laughlin, they just needed to figure out the perfect setting and role.  Hello the ""Five-0"" reboot, and hello to the iconic role of McGarrett.  O'Laughlin has a LOT of fun with his take--it's a far more physical and humorous role than what Lord did back in the day; emphasizing his SEAL training and using his Navy connections--especially his female Navy intelligence officer girlfriend (Michelle Borth) to get satellites retasked, how at ease McGarrett is back in Hawaii.  But the ongoing storyline of McGarrett--his father John's murder, and the deeper web that his father was involved in--has become the darker side of Steve, and what drives him.
  It was well-known, LONG before ""Hawaii Five-0"" was completely put together, that Daniel Dae Kim was going to get Chin Ho Kelly--DDK had fallen for Hawaii during the six years ""Lost"" was shot there.  HE WASN'T LEAVING--and really, who could blame him??!?  The backstory of Chin--where Chin is tied to the McGarretts because John was his training officer/first partner, and finding Chin as a ""mall cop"" working at the beach after resigning from the Honolulu department under a cloud of suspicion regarding money taken out of lock-up--gives Chin a great internal dignity, a want to prove that he is still a man of the law while protecting the real circumstances of the disappearance of the money.  Again, DDK's Chin is a little rougher than Kam Fong's Chin in the original series--a Harley-ridin', shotgun-toting officer, with a little bit of a history with a certain female doctor (Reiko Aylesworth)...
  Obviously, one couldn't even begin to compare Grace Park's Kono Kalakaua with Zulu from HF-0, version 1.  I've often wondered if Park has spoken to her agent--""Next time we try to get me in a series, can it NOT be a situation of a reboot with me playing a formerly male character??!?""  Park's Kono--Chin's cousin, the former surfer joining HPD as have many members of Chin and Kono's family--seems as willing to take risks as McGarrett.  She's also as smart as a whip, working around the computers that Five-0 has installed in their offices, and has no qualms about getting phyiscal with bad guys.  Plus, she's gorgeous.  Then again, it's Grace Park--we shouldn't have expected any different.
  This brings us to Scott Caan's Danny Williams; a brilliant take on the character by showrunners Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, and a scene-stealing season on the part of Caan.  Williams gets reimaged as a HPD detective who transferred from New Jersey to be close to his daughter after his ex-wife remarried and moved to Hawaii.  He DESPISES Hawaii--the beaches, the weather, the attitude, the food (""You DON'T PUT PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!!!!""...); he isn't enamored with McGarrett's willingness to not follow ""police procedure""--and frequently isn't enamored with McGarrett (""Anuerysm Face""--loved that line), openly wonders why he's letting Steve drive HIS car (Do love that Camaro), has issues with McGarret's T-shirt/cargo pants work clothes while insisting that a tie looks more professional...AND HATES BEING CALLED ""DANNO"", except by his daughter.  Clearly, Cann's take on the nominal number-two of Five-0 really goes away from James McArthur.  AND IT IS A BETTER TAKE.  Cann very much reminds me of his father when James was younger and more energetic--his Sonny Corleone days--and the energy he brings to Danny is just a kick.
  The supporting players play large--and yes, I'm using that as a pun when I mention Taylor Willy's Kamekona,
Five-0's street information person.  Clearly, the former sumo wrestler isn't a small person.  However, Teilor Grubbs is--and she is solid as Danny's daughter, as is Claire van der Boom as her mother--Danny's ex-wife.  Masi Oka really doesn't get enough screen time as Five-0's medical examiner, Dr. Max Bergmann, though we get enough to realize that Max operates off the beaten path.  Dennis Chun--whose father WAS Kam Tong--has a recurring role as HPD Sgt. Duke Lukela, a character also from the original series.  The veteran actress Jean Smart plays the Governor of Hawaii, Pat Jameson, in the first season.  Without giving any spoilers, it is safe to say that Smart draws liberally from having worked with Gregory Itzin on ""24"".
  Of course, there's Mark Dacascos--because the legend of ""Hawaii Five-0"" must include Wo Fat.  The Chairman from ""Iron Chef America"" gives a certain amount of menace to his appearances during the year as the crime boss/terrorist/mercenary/All-Around Bad Guy.  Being the martial artist that he is, Dacascos knows how to radiate the danger that should be associated with the story's main and ongoing antagonist.  Given that in this version of the story, Wo Fat is really connected from the beginning with the deaths of both of McGarrett's parents, it seems proper that while he isn't seen too often in the first season, Wo Fat plays a key part of the storyline.
  For the most part, Season 1 of ""Hawaii Five-0"" is standard cop fare--murders, kidnappings, piracy...but what makes the season is the writing.  The byplay and verbal sparring between the lead characters is brilliant and well executed.  In it's way the series is more spirited than the original version--again, a good thing. That we have the two ongoing storylines in the season--McGarrett starting to unravel his father's investigation, and the story of why Chin Ho left HPD--draws the viewer into the season.
  Bottom line here is that it's a good cast, and it's a great looking cast.  It's a familiar story to many, updated for this generation, and we get to see Hawaii.  It's heavy on the action, good with the humor.  Overall, it's easy on the eyes and an easy story to follow.  Honestly, it's much more watchable than the original series.  That might be sacrilege to some, but to me, it's the truth.
  Highly reccommended.",1324512000,,9055,4.905982905982906

4178877,5,B003R4ZMO0,"When I started watching this program, I intended to dislike it. This has got to be one of the few remakes (in film and television) that turned out well.

The old series was AWESOME! They shot it in Hawaii, back when the film had to be sent airmail back to LA to be shown on television. They hired Hawaiians, back when television was Caucasians only (with very few exceptions). Long before the over done buddy cop thing was all over television, they were doing it right. It was a serious program, with occasional funny parts.

The new series is very good. It is edited and paced for the FAR shorter attention spans of the modern audience. Like another good program NCIS, the crimes are secondary to the interaction between the characters. All the actors are very good, and it is a joy for me to watch the program. Danny's divorce is one malfunction after another, and you laugh because you are glad it isn't you. Chin Ho, is a very honorable man, who was accused of taking bribes, they couldn't find any proof, but that didn't stop his reputation from getting destroyed. Kono is not just a gorgeous woman and put there for window dressing, she is a inexperienced, but very intelligent woman who is more than capable of taking care of herself.... this is a rare thing on television! McGarrett is a very experienced SecOps soldier. He lacks subtlety, and tends to go at a problem head on, this drives Danny (who prefers to be quiet and subtle) nuts!

I also think it is funny that only in America can an Australian doing a very good American accent, plays a SEAL that was born in Hawaii... and the two 'Hawaiians' look suspiciously like Koreans! :)

There is very little about this series that I don't like. The new version of the theme is excellent, but they cut it too short. I hope they will have a full length version on the DVD set, as a extra.",1310256000,17,1846,4.468842729970326

I stumbled across the last few minutes of the pilot episode and thought what little I saw was well done, so the next week I gave it a chance, and from then on I was hooked.  I love the different ways in which they respect and pay tribute to the original show, still keeping ""Book Em Danno"" in many episodes and even giving Jack Lord's car from the old show a role of its own in the new show.  The character chemistry is wonderful, especially between Steve and Danny.  In fact, their friendship and bantering is the highlight of the show in my opinion.

4178893,5,B003R4ZMO0,"""Hawaii Five-O"" reimagines the popular 1970's TV series into present day Hawaii, with stories ripped from the headlines on terrorism, criminal gangs, official corruption, and murder.  ""Hawaii Five-O"" ended up the highest ranked new drama of the 2010-2011 season, now available on DVD for anyone who missed it.

The show begins with Navy Lieutenant Commander Steve McGarrett, son of the now retired head of the Honolulu Police Department, on a mission to bring in a known terrorist arms dealer, only to be blackmailed over the phone by the man's brother, who is holding the elder McGarrett hostage.  Both the brother and the father end up dead.  The young McGarrett, an angry SEAL, returns to Hawaii for revenge. He learns that his father was involved in a far reaching investigation into official corruption, and ends up appointed by the Governor of Hawaii to run his own elite investigative task force outside police channels.  McGarrett (played by a superbly cast Alex O'Loughlin) is joined by Chin Ho (Daniel Dae Kim), a disgraced former Honolulu cop; Chin's rookie cop cousin Kono (Grace Park); and misplaced New Jersey cop Danny (Danno) Williams (Scott Caan).  In late season, Jenna Kaye (Larisa Oleynik) joined the cast as an intelligence analyst.  O'Loughlin and Caan turn out to be a superbly mismatched (and funny) buddy team.

The show offers weekly police procedural drama, set against the lovely landscape and unique culture of Hawaii.  One connecting thread is Five-O's follow-up on the elder McGarrett's investigation, which leads them to the smooth but ruthless mobster Wo Fat.  A second theme is the redemption of Chin Ho, cashiered from HPD for corruption but in fact left holding the bag for another officer.  A third thread is Danny Williams' effort to stay close to his young daughter and his divorced wife.

The Five-O task force makes its own rules and plays hard, in the process making lots of enemies.  In the devastating cliffhanger season finale, Wu Fat lays a clever trap and takes his revenge, leaving the team in a shambles.  Fortunately, ""Hawaii Five-O"" was renewed for a second season.  ""Hawaii Five-O: The First Season"" is highly recommended to its fans.",1306454400,,2186,5.050139275766017
4178894,5,B003R4ZMO0,"This ""re-boot"" of Hawaii Five-0 has turned out to be a special jewel in CBS'TV's line-up of shows. For me, admittedly, I am a devoted Alex O'Loughlin fan and was just very happy to see him back on TV in a successful series. He surely deserved it!!  I will admit, however, that it took more than half a season for me to warm up to McGarrett (his character, not his looks, which are stunningly sex-tacular....he's so HOT).

I fell in ""love"" with the very passionate, angst-ridden, romantic Mick St. John on Moonlight and really had do to a full circle turn to ""warm up"" to Alex as H50's stoic, short-haired military-man McGarrett.  Of course, Alex succeeded in doing this brilliantly - warming me up that is - and there is absolutely no trace of Mick St. John in McGarrett's persona - he really did his homework on this guy.

This show is so beautifully done - scenery, photography, writing, humor (love the banter and looks exchanged between McGarrett and Danno).  Admittedly, some shows were better than others, but all were good. Do we have to suspend reality sometimes??  Of course we do .....this is TV entertainment.....and don't we all have enough reality in our everyday lives!

Now that we have gotten to know the characters better, and can empathize and root for them, the next season should prove very interesting and exciting with some much-anticipated action and answers. I look forward to it every week and DVR it if I'm not going to be home.  I will definitely buy the DVD set - I'll probably enjoy it even better without commercials.

I'm looking forward to Season 2 and I'm happy for cast and crew that we will see more of them.
I only wish CBS/Warner Bros. had given Moonlight half the chance they've given Hawaii Five-0, but that's a whole other story !!

First, it's not fair to compare it to the old show, it's not the old show, but it's just as good. This works on so many levels.

The characters/casting are awesome.  O'Loughlin does a nice job as McGarrett.  It's not over the top, and he's making McGarrett his own.  Scott Caan is wonderful as Danno.  The chem. between Cann and O'Loughlin is a nice touch. It would have been to easy to have the two of them being buddy buddy all the time.  They're the opposite ends of the same coin.  They play off each other nicely. Kim does a nice job as Kelly.  It was a risk to have Kono as a woman, but Park does a nice job of it. I also like how she can kick butt.  All four of them play off each other nicely.  I also love Taylor Wily as Kamekona. I also love Mark Dacascos as Wu Fat.  I love how they give small nods to the old show. For fans of the old show, the guy who plays Duke is the son of Kam Fong, who played the original Chin Ho Kelly. A very nice touch.

The writing and scripts are awesome.  There is just one small flaw to it. One of the eppys this season was one of the original stories from the original 5-O, but it's not a big deal.  The cliffhanger was awesome!

I can't say enough good things about this. If you can catch this on repeats this summer, I highly suggest it.  When it comes to DVD, I'll be the first in line to get it.

4178901,5,B003R4ZMO0,"The thing about Hawaii Five-0, I think you either love it or hate it.

Now it isn't always perfect, and let's be honest, what show is - there'll always be episodes with weaker plots than others. And if you don't like explosions, gunfights, sunshine, bikinis and banter, this is probably not your show.

But even when you take away the pretty setting and the action Hawaii Five-0 still has a core that rings true. Because this show is all about family. The lenghts you'll go for your family, losing an old and acquiring a new and all versions of the term that excists. Ohana, as the Hawai'ians would say. It is the characters who carry the show.

Steve, who loses his father and tries to patch up his relationship with his sister.
Danny, who moves halfway across the world to be with his daughter.
And last but CERTAINLY *never* least, Chin and Kono, the pair of counsins, who will do and sacrifice everything for their family.
These four come together and find themselves thrown into their own kind of family, and this is where the show has its heart.

One thing I love about this show is that even though Steve is the main character with Danny at his side most of the time it never becomes the Steve McGarret Show or the Steve and Danno show. Chin and Kono are never reduced to 'lackeys' or 'helpers' of any kind. They have their own scenes, their own plot and they get to shine just as much as Steve and Danny. One could easily argue that some of the strongest scenes of the season were acted out by the amazing Grace Park and fantastic Daniel Dae Kim.

Another great thing is the team dynamic. It's not just Steve and Danny's partnership that sends sparks flying across the screen - it IS a huge reason for why I watch this show, but it is far from the only reason why I enjoy it as much as I do. The team together is amazing. They tease and they jibe and they got each other's back no matter what. Kono and Danny has an awesome chemistry and Chin doesn't hesitate to call Steve and Danny 'ladies' when they need to be called down to earth. It's rare to have four leads who just work no matter which constallation you put them in.

Enough about the main characters, because the regulars and guest stars definitely deserve a mention, too. Danny's daughter is made of adorable, his ex-wife is a brilliant character, McGarret's sister is made of awesome and Kamekona is just made of win. The show also really lets local actors shine. Again, no show is perfect and not each and every guest star is equally good, but they definitely hit more than they miss, in my opinion.

Now, if this kind of action packed, entertainment minded, doesn't-pretend-to-be-something-it's-not show is not your thing, fair enough. If you don't like actor X's portrayal of character X, okay then, we all have different tastes. What I'm saying is: This show may sometimes seem ridiculous (and seriously, which promos saying things like ""It's not just hot - it's explosive"" it's unavoidable) and some may call it a disgrace to the original (I wouldn't know, I wasn't born), but it does have a lot to offer, even besides the pretty scenery and action, and definitely deserves a chance.

Personally, I'm enjoying it. Every single week. In different amounts depending on the episode, perhaps, but I NEVER leave thinking 'okay, this was a waste of time'! To the very much contrary. I've become invested in the characters. I smile, I laugh, I worry. I obsess. I melt every time Steve makes those eyes (you know the ones), I shout at the screen when an episode ends in a cliffhanger. I rewatch my favorite clips, promos and YouTube videos multiple times. Hey, I even have an iTunes playlist with Hawaii Five-0 themed songs.

In conclusion: Brilliant acting, engaging characters and definitely worth giving a chance. If you don't like it, don't see what I see, hey, that's okay.",1304985600,19,3845,4.585152838427947
4178902,5,B003R4ZMO0,"I am a H5-0 fan way back from the original. I'm one of those who've waited all these years for a modern version and now it's here! They're still finding their sea legs, but the show keeps getting better and better with each new episode. I'm a regular watcher, I pre-ordered the new show on DVD -- I just hope it comes out in Blu-ray! Good to see they're giving cameo roles to some of the original actors -- Al Harrington for instance. And the new characters are a trip, like the big guy who sells shave ice. And you can't find more gorgeous shots of Hawaii anywhere on TV. They are reaching for what counts: good story, good acting, good direction. My only beef -- and it's a BIG one -- is the music.  They cut the theme song in half! In fact, more than half! And the scenes have what I call ""generic moron music"" droning away in the background instead of background music written -- as it was in the 70s-- for mainly winds, brass and percussion based on the theme song.  Just to stuff another commercial in there? Come on!!! Oh yeah, and General Motors is having its revenge over Ford -- used to be in the original that all the good guys rode around in Ford cars and the GMs were driven by the baddies. Now that's all reversed!  

UPDATE 8/31/14: One thing is tremendously disappointing: these are only DVD and not Blu-Ray. While the color is fine, the clarity is awful. Until they release episodes in Blu-Ray, I'll not be buying any more. ",1304467200,5,1441,4.338289962825279

The biggest knock I have is against the producers, why do they dress McGarret in an unbuttoned shirt?  It's very unprofessional for a law enforcement officer, it takes away from his supposed authority figure.  Maybe they can fix that for season 2.",1304467200,,518,4.840909090909091
4178924,5,B003R4ZMO0,"Amongst the river of procedurals in this day and age, it takes a little something extra to stand out to me. Having never seen the original Hawaii Five-O, I came into this series unspoiled and open to being impressed. And believe me, they had me hooked from the first explosion.

Okay, I'll admit, the majority of the cases aren't that hard to figure out. In fact, I dare say that the cases - with the exception of the character driven story arcs that are woven throughout the season - aren't the big draw for this series. Its the character's chemistry with one another - specifically Alex O'Loughlin's Steve McGarrett and Scott Caan's Danny ""Danno"" Williams. It's the location, because I can barely remember a series shot solely in Hawaii (maybe Magnum PI). The combination of a cast that works well together, draws the viewers in and makes us care about them AND the beautiful, exotic backdrop of Hawaii is an intoxicating mix.

The action and drama of solving the cases with this crew is tempered by moments of touching friendship and hilarious banter - again Danny and Steve are the main magnet for this show, I have no doubt - and underneath the day-to-day dealings in crime fighting, there is a mystery. It always helps to have an ubber-villian like Wo Fat tied into this mystery.

Not since the days of Starskey and Hutch, I have rarely seen to leading men play off each other so well, as our Steve and Danny. Season one builds their partnership as well as their friendship, because both are semi-outcasts in Hawaii. Steve's laser-focus, inherent bravery and penchant for leadership is balanced with a vulnerability that only Alex O'Loughlin can produce. Scott Caan brings the rough around the edges New Jersey Cop, the true outsider in Hawaii, to the table with the compassion of a father who moved half way around the globe to be with his daughter. Daniel Dae Kim's Chin Ho Kelly and Grace Park's Kono  add the cement to hold this team together on the island.

The character driven episodes are, in my opinion, the best by far. We learn about what drives our heroes, what scares them and what they will kill and die for. Steve's family is fully of secrets yet to be fully vetted out. Danny must reconcile with his ex, and with his need to make the island - the island that makes him feel even more like an outsider - a safer place for his kid. Chin deals with the mystery behind his disgrace from the HPD, along with his cousin Kono, who's just getting her feet wet as the rookie cop.

These are character begging to be drawn out for the viewer, and towards the end of the season, we are starting to see that. I can only hope to get more of the character development and character driven plots I'm starving for in Season 2.

Season 1 is a wild ride, getting to know these characters and how they do their job. Not to say that there aren't a couple of dud episodes, but for the most part, the writers expertly balance the action with angst, the solemness with humor, and they picked a fabulous cast to play it all out for us.",1304380800,6,3032,4.51183970856102

It is a triple bonus that he is starring in a show filmed in stunningly beautiful Hawaii, and that the chemistry of the entire cast is so good that 5-0 has easily become the best drama/comedy on television. Clever writing, Alex's brilliant portrayal of McGarrett, the insanely funny banter between him and Danno ( I often find Steve's dry humor the most amusing), and the infectious characters of Chin and Kono have made 5-0 stand out among all shows on any network line-up. Thankyou Peter Lenkov, and all who make this unforgettable hour come alive each week.  I wish there were 7 Mondays to my week (: xox Ronnette",1304380800,4,841,4.519736842105263
4178926,5,B003R4ZMO0,"No one knew what to expect. But, that was yesterday. Today we know better.
This is a great cast whose crime fighting drama is set in Hawaii. The main characters are a tight knit group who have come together over this first season.

The season starts with the cast as they first meet. Then as each show develops, we see the characters and their friendships also developing. The investigation techniques, the danger, the plots...all are becoming better and better. And the rapport, friendships, and best of all the humor, tie it all up for the viewers to enjoy.",1304380800,4,559,4.704081632653061
4178927,5,B003R4ZMO0,"I have loved HAWAII 5-0  ever since the Pilot which I watched at SUNSET ON THE BEACH in Waikiki. It was really gripping from the first  ""BOOM"" and the sound of the iconic theme song. I still love it!!The cast is perfectly picked and totally believable as STEVE, DANNO, CHIN and KONO and are very ably supported by guest stars and regulars. This series has it all. Gorgeous actors, great writers,suspense,action,sex appeal and magnificent scenery!!!!In fact it is an instant Hawaiian holiday-with punch !!!!",1304380800,5,506,5.011904761904762
4178928,5,B003R4ZMO0,"I love everything about Hawaii Five-0, starting with the breathtaking scenery, to creative writing and to the most important a very talented cast, Alex O'Loughlin portrayal of Lt. Commander Steve McGarrett is superb and always leave me and my family wanting to see more!! Hawaii Five-0 has the best drama and action packed stories than any other show on TV!",1304294400,5,357,4.966666666666667
4178929,5,B003R4ZMO0,"The 2010 Hawaii 5-0 television series has become the #1 show in my house.  No phone calls,visits or even extraneous talking are allowed during the airing of H5-0! Family members have learned these rules the hard way! Have to honestly say this is the first network television production that I have faithfully followed in many, many years.  The actors are stellar in their performances, the writers are spot on, the characterizations are great.  The only minor flaw could be considered the weekly crime procedural.  Occasionally I find myself so wrapped up in what is happening between the characters, that I forget there is a crime to solve! Over the top? Of course! Fun to watch? Absolutely! The DVD set a ""must have""?  YES!! Can't wait for the Blue Ray set!",1304294400,3,759,4.8076923076923075
4178930,5,B003R4ZMO0,"I didn't want to watch this show. I didn't like the original despite being a big fan of older cop shows. But my husband wanted to check it out so I did. It just blew me away.

People really, really need to give this show a chance. The pilot ep was great but then the second ep not so much third ep good and the forth ep a bit weak. I think that a few people drifted away but after episode five it just got better and better and better.

Firstly, Alex O'Loughlin is brilliant as McGarrett. He starts the show as this stoic, buttoned up Seal but slowly reveals more of the characters inner workings and we see that at times he can be a softy, he can also lose his temper on occasion and has a great sense of humor.

Danno is like a wasp in a bottle. Always riled and annoyed but funny with it. I love Danno cause he calls McGarrett on all his crazy moves.

DDK and Grace Parks are both great too, DDK brings a seriousness and understatedness to the show and Grace Parks is cute and funny as Kono the rookie who is eagerly following in McGarretts footsteps.

The arguments and banter are funny and make the show and I've read that a lot of it is unscripted and improved between Caan and O'Loughlin.

The action is movie caliber and the HD shoots of Hawaii just stunning.

This show beats the CSI's/Criminal Minds and most other procedurals out there. If you like NCIS you'll love this - although it is different in many ways it has some of the same elements.

Finally the cast have amazing chemistry and they all look great (especially the supremely gorgeous Alex).

All in all only a miserable stick in the mud could not enjoy this show. No it isn't realistic or gritty or serious - its just a big old bag of actiony fun and sometimes that is just what the doctor ordered. Give it a chance and give the characters time to grow on you - you won't regret it!",1304294400,17,1854,4.214689265536723
4178931,5,B003R4ZMO0,"Aloha! This show is the best thing to happen to TV since sliced bread! Alex and Scott together are magic. Long time fan of Alex O'Loughlin and he has stepped into and managed to replace some mighty big shoes! Nicely done Mr. O'Loughlin. A real hero's hero! The man is mega mega mega talented!
Pure entertainment from start to finish! Peter Lenkov is a genius. Hats off to the cast Alex O'Loughlin, Scott Caan, Grace Park and Daniel Dae Kim for a memorable team of heros. The crew for the breathtaking camera work, the writers for the best lines and to Hawaii for being so darn beautiful! Mahalo and Aloha.
This show is AWESOME!",1304294400,3,627,4.508771929824562
4178932,5,B003R4ZMO0,"As a huge fan of the original H-50, I never though that anyone could ever put together a cast or stories that would make a die hard fan like myself happy, but they did it and hope we have another 12 years of H-50.
The show definitely needs some work, but the groundwork is set for many years to come !!
Cannot wait for it to come to DVD !",1304294400,,338,3.842857142857143
4178933,5,B003R4ZMO0,"This show is a tribute to the original with it's own origial spin to it.  It is better than the original.  I watched it when Jack Lord was McGarret and Jack Lord would be so proud.  I love Scott Cann as Dano, and love the way he got his nick-name.  Daniel Day Kim and Grace Park and fabulous in their parts.  You have to see this show.  It is exciting and keeps you on your toes and touches your heart as well.  It is now one my favorites that I WILL NOT MISS!  Way to go guys.  Thanks for giving us such a wonderful show!  I can't say enough good things about it.  I cannot wait until the DVD comes out!!

4178935,5,B003R4ZMO0,"I honestly did not watch the original show partly to do with the fact I was not even born when it came out. And I have never been a fan of any cop shows . They were always so boring to me.

But I have watched ever one of these and really do like it. For those who are only annoied because of Scott well to me he is really good and some my favorite lines for the show are from Danny.

I just find the details to be funny 1 disc for 24 ep?",1299801600,,437,3.5894736842105264

The cast are all great, and the setting is wonderful in beautiful Hawaii! Just an outstanding show to watch every week. I am looking forward for more exciting episodes and seasons to come! I love Hawaii 5-0. This show and The Walking Dead For the win!",1298505600,5,374,4.357142857142857
4178938,5,B003R4ZMO0,"I loved the original show and I actually love this one more. Yeah, sure, they've put in a young cast. Actually that's more like youngER. That, however, doesn't really matter much. The way in how the actors work together on-screen is amazing. It's almost like one big actor with a bunch of smaller parts acting as a whole.
I'm also glad to see that Alex hasn't lost any of his touch from the Moonlight series; he's as good as I expected him to be. Scott Caan plays an original Dano with some good humor and character that compliments Alex's. The rest of the cast is top notch as well.
I understand that some people just don't like certain things, but I am amazed that this show actually got a 1-star rating from someone. However, I will not put down an honest review, and I thank you for your input.
Loved every episode, and I can't wait to get the full season on Blu-ray.",1298246400,4,871,4.3496932515337425

4178941,5,B003R4ZMO0,"For those curmudgeons who want to write it off as another lame remake, you are missing out on a great show! It has all the best parts of the original, probably the best theme song ever on tv, the beautiful scenery of Hawaii(in Hi-def no less and plenty of action! What makes it even better is the chemistry between this shows Steve and Danno and the beautiful scenery of Grace Park in mostly bikinis and lingerie (in Hi-def no less)(LOL)!",1294358400,6,438,4.4875
4178942,5,B003R4ZMO0,"Was very skeptical when I first heard about this TV series - mostly because no one can replace Jack Lord as Steve McGarrett or any of the other cast members from the original episodes.  I couldn't imagine how they could replace Dano either or have a female cast member.  But, after watching several episodes, I would rate this the best TV watching out there, 5 stars.  The plots are great, interesting and intense and the acting is wonderful - I enjoy the relationship and humor between Dano and Steve McGarrett.  I don't try to compare the old with the new - just enjoy watching it as a new TV series that is just good crime drama.",1293235200,57,632,4.422413793103448

I am disabled and watch a lot of TV and also after watching the 1968 to 1980 original Hawaii Five-0 on me TV from beginning to and it actually reminds me again of how good this actually is! There was never  A funny rivalry between McGarrett and Dano but at the same time they made this show their own and did a wonderful job. I forgot how great the original really was for TV and the day but this is absolutely a great TV for our day, today! Enjoy I would highly recommend!  There is also earlier on in this,  a crossover episode between this and NCIS LA which is well done.",1514246400,,686,4.135338345864661
