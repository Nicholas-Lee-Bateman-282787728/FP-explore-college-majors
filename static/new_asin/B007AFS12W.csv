5072119,5,B007AFS12W,"I'm always on the hunt for new and interesting travel shows on TV.  When I first discovered Aerial America on the Smithsonian channel I knew I found something that would be enjoyable to watch.  More than enjoyable, I discovered how beautiful the aerial photography is and how informative the narration of the particular state being shown is.  At that point I knew I wanted to have Aerial America on dvd to watch anytime I wanted and to share with others.  Until I have the chance to get out there and see more of America for myself I'll enjoy dvds of Aerial America.",1346112000,9,566,4.519607843137255
5072120,4,B007AFS12W,"The photography is great. I watched California and I am disappointed. The film spends a lot of time on Hearst Castle, and farm land and even recreational reservoir. It does not cover southern California at all. I know California is big and it's hard to cover in one hour. But I don't understand how LA and southern California is missed.",1341187200,26,336,4.616666666666666
5072121,1,B007AFS12W,"Music entirely TOO LOUD, defeats the entire purpose if you cannot hear the narrator & know what they are showing you!  Absolutely beautiful but
PLEASE do it over & lower the music volume & get a narrator with a strong voice  (Campbell Scott could give this the touch
it desperately needs)",1437868800,,288,4.627450980392157
5072122,5,B007AFS12W,"I watched all installments in the series on the Smithsonian Channel, and kept quite a few on my DVR. Finally decided to clear the space there and got three most interesting regions on DVD. I live in Nevada and we make a lot of short trips instead of taking long vacations. Watching Aerial America helps me plan these trips. I learned quite a few things about my own and neighboring states and was interested enough to go and visit the landmarks.",1436400000,2,445,4.506172839506172

5072128,2,B007AFS12W,"Aerial America is best when viewed using a Blu-ray player, otherwise the video definition is very poor.",1424649600,,103,5.117647058823529
5072129,5,B007AFS12W,"Actually, the only reason I bought this iteration of Aerial America was for the unavailable. single issue of Hawaii being a part of it. I hunted high and low for Hawaii, couldn't find it anywhere. So, this was the alternative. Not a bad one, but still an alternative.",1423267200,2,267,4.583333333333333

5072132,5,B007AFS12W,"The video quality is crisp. Visual artifacts are nonexistent. The colors are rich. The flyover views are breathtaking. This blu-ray can demonstrate some of the best video that your HDTV can produce.

The only bad thing about this blu-ray, is that after watching it, you know just how good your TV can look. Afterwords, most streaming video is disappointing.",1418083200,,357,5.0508474576271185
5072133,5,B007AFS12W,perfect packing,1416787200,,15,7.0

5072138,1,B007AFS12W,I don't know about this specific video but in  every aerial America I have seen the music is too damn loud!  Is it possible to just narrate without the constant background interference?  I think it is a cartoon mentality that thinks constant noise is necessary when you're trying to listen to something that drives the makers of this beautiful scenery to supply it.  Can we please grow up and at least TURN THE BACKGROUND NOISE WAY DOWN?,1410480000,6,437,4.636363636363637
5072139,5,B007AFS12W,"highly recommended.  I live in Washington state and learned so much about the state I didn't know.  All the ""collections"" in series are fantastic.",1410307200,,146,5.041666666666667

5072142,5,B007AFS12W,"This is a great series and we have a special love for the Pacific Rim, and, the mingled cultures, so seeing this gives us a different perspective and an excellent history lesson in the development of the land and states. Wow, what a neat idea!",1406851200,,243,4.4222222222222225
5072143,5,B007AFS12W,Simply a fabulous show.  Just what you'd hope for.,1404777600,,50,4.555555555555555

5072145,5,B007AFS12W,"I saw some of the California edition and enjoyed the vivid photography and the storyline. It is the best of all the aerial collections
yet produced.  Beautiful on a big screen.",1395100800,,176,4.67741935483871
5072146,5,B007AFS12W,I recommend those two blue rays. They are amazing. It's a wonderfull travel  through spectaculars views of Americas Parls and breathtaking views of the states.,1394323200,,159,5.36
5072147,4,B007AFS12W,"Overall I really enjoy the series because it's relaxing to watch.  The only downside is the section on California spends too much time in Santa Barbara (maybe it's cheap to rent a helicopter there).  There is no time spent on LA, San Diego, or the High Sierras.",1391644800,,261,4.531914893617022
5072148,5,B007AFS12W,I had seen the items on television and appreciated all facets.  Our grandson recenty moved from Virginia to Oregon....I purchased the DVD for his use in getting acqainted with that area.  Scott Martin,1389830400,,200,5.03030303030303
5072149,3,B007AFS12W,"We just want to look at the scenery, we just want to look at the scenery.  Its like being at a boring slide presentation on someones holiday who goes into great length about irrelevant topics.  The film is like propaganda for American big business.  This type of product should be visual not verbal.  I don't want a lecture, overlong treatment of some oppressive media baron's home, or Bill Gates house for that matter. Still the rest of the time there was some great scenery.",1388620800,4,476,4.630952380952381
5072150,4,B007AFS12W,"As I was watching this Blu-Ray disc, it was pretty hard to believe how amazing it looked. Put your HDTV picture mode in Cinema mode and at 120Hz refresh rate (or higher) and you'll see an incredible picture, almost 3-D. I recommend it to anyone.",1385769600,,245,4.466666666666667
5072151,5,B007AFS12W,"Smithsonian has done it yet again! We have been watching this series on Aerial America, and were delighted that this group of programs is available on plain DVD. We hope other groups will also be out on plain DVD.",1385510400,,213,4.487179487179487
5072152,4,B007AFS12W,The series is excellent with one exception. CA only covered part of the state. Need a CA II showing Southern CA including LA and San Diego. This one does not make sense.,1384214400,2,169,4.3125
5072153,5,B007AFS12W,"Interesting to watch this about so many amazing states, would recommend this video for those who appreciate learning about history and enjoying photography",1381881600,,155,5.782608695652174
5072154,5,B007AFS12W,As soon they're available I'll buy the all.  Superb done.  Love it.  I've seen some on Discovery and I found out they're available at Amazon.  So I bought them.,1378512000,,160,4.413793103448276
5072155,5,B007AFS12W,What can I say that could do this film justice. It is the best of the best in travel films. I will be collecting all new releases from this Smithsonian Series. Have many other travel films but this is by far the most beautifully filmed and even has some interesting educational narration. Highly recommend it.,1376438400,2,309,4.636363636363637
5072156,5,B007AFS12W,Without your magnificient creation I would never have the opportunity for such breathtaking moments of beauty and wonder of the wonderous Pacific Rim,1375747200,,149,5.521739130434782
5072157,5,B007AFS12W,This is beautiful - and great information about each location.  The aerial photography is outstanding.  Nearly four hours of superb entertainment and information.  Great!,1374364800,,170,6.0
5072158,4,B007AFS12W,"This is a very good show. I would recommend this. They only thing is that it only shows Northern California. Also on Hawaii, this they to not show the west side of Maui and some important tourest destinations. On Oahu, the to not show any of the east coast. Not much of the north shore and nothing on the southern show. Oregon is good, and Washington state, but I have never been to those states, so am not sure what they missed, but over all, the quaility of very good. They colors are very vibrant. It is good to watch and see some of the west coast and Hawaii, if you have not been there.",1373241600,2,591,4.147826086956521
5072159,5,B007AFS12W,"GREAT VIEWS, SPETACULAR IMAGE QUALITY. THIS IS THE BEST BLU-RAY OF ENTIRE SERIES. CALIFORNIA AND HAWAII ARE AMAZING STATES. MUST SEE.",1373241600,,133,5.380952380952381
5072160,5,B007AFS12W,"This is a beautiful aerial video of the Pacific Rim States, Washington,  Oregon,  California and Hawaii.  Even if you have been to many of these very special States, you will see them from a very different perspective.  You feel like you are in the airplane flying as the video is being filmed.",1368057600,2,294,4.596153846153846
5072161,5,B007AFS12W,"Better than I expected!
I had purchased the entire ""Visions Of"" collection...... (Visions of Europe - 10 DVD set).
I loved them all, and thought there was nothing in the USA that would touch me like they did.
This fooled me, I was really taken with the entire DVD.
No, it cannot compete with the scenic beauty of Greece or Italy.
But for being here in the USA, I was very impressed.
It includes Hawaii on the DVD as well.
Considering I have purchased both ""Visions of Hawaii"" and ""Over Hawaii"" and was pissed with both DVD's.
""Visions of"" had their Giant Logo in the right corner THROUGH THE ENTIRE DVD - DISTRACTING DURING THE ENTIRE DVD.
""Over Hawaii"" would put a ""Giant Splash"" of lettering across the entire screen, displaying the name of the location, the only thing was, they would display that location for almost a minute in ""Giant Lettering"" middle of the screen, so you could not enjoy the beautiful, scenic view!!  I can read the giant lettering within seconds, do you have to display it for a full minute?
STUPID!!
This Hawaii DVD, IS THE ONLY AERIAL VIEW OF HAWAII WITHOUT ANY VISUAL DISTRACTION IN YOUR FACE.
It is worth the cost of the DVD just for Hawaii alone.
That being said....sometimes beautiful vineyards of grapes, aerial views of Hearst Castle, and the entire ""Pacific Ocean Coastline""  (California to Washington) can be just as breathtaking as any scenic DVD of Europe.",1367884800,15,1394,4.685714285714286
5072162,5,B007AFS12W,"I watch the show Aerial America to bring back memories of the Fantastic places that I have seen while traveling this Amazing Country. I, also use Aerial America to find places I would love to see in the future. Aerial America is one of those shows that I can watch with my Parents and even youngsters and each generation is enjoying the show. Sharing experiences with the adults and explaining the travel experience with the kids. The time flies very quickly while watching the episodes. Get together and share while learning about your Fantastic Country while watching this Blu-ray. P.S. The HD is Amazing.",1366848000,,607,4.846153846153846
5072163,1,B007AFS12W,"This blu-ray would be much more enjoyable if it had a music soundtrack: how about Mozart, Beethoven or even Led Zep? It seemed that this blu-ray would never end. The California narrator mispronounced every place with a Spanish name except Point Reyes, which is pronounced Point Rays by Californians.
I have a solution to this problem. Throw this one out and replace  it with Best of Travel with Rudy Maxa: San Francico, Vancouver, Seattle plus Over Hawaii by soaring visions in HD. And for an additional treat get Escape to French Polynesia (Tahiti, Bora Bora, Marquesas Islands and Tuamotu Atolls with Rudy Maxa). i will never buy another Smithsonian blu-ray.",1364688000,4,660,5.0

5072166,5,B007AFS12W,We have enjoyed the entire aerial America series. This is a spectacular DVD. I plan to collect certain aerial DVD's and also give them as gifts!,1357430400,,144,4.576923076923077
5072167,5,B007AFS12W,"The 'Visions of...' series has always been one of my favorite travel series. I never discovered anything else quite like it ... until I watched this set, 'Aerial America: Pacific Rim',  from the Smithsonian Channel. The beautiful aerial photography is accompanied by a wonderfully informative narration. Each state's uniqueness is highlighted by the narrator with appropriate and un-intrusive musical scores. California is somewhat shorted but that is understandable considering how big the state is. A 'California, part II' is definitely called for. Hawaii was covered more completely than any other video travel video I have ever seen, and I learned facts about Washington and Oregon that I never knew.

The photography does not rush the viewer through the scenery. It allows the viewer to savor each view.  No quick cuts and fast edits here which is often a major fault of some other video travelogues.  I hoe that the Smithsonian will publish the complete set soon. I will certainly be a thankful buyer.

Highly recommended.",1357344000,4,1028,5.206060606060606
5072168,2,B007AFS12W,"I bought this dvd for my hearing impared son.  The lable says ""closed captioned"" but it isn't.  Tried every which way to access the captions with no success.  My son's worn a hearing aid since he was 2, he's now 34.  No captions was a very big disappointment.",1356480000,4,259,4.333333333333333
5072169,5,B007AFS12W,Words cannot describe the awesome journey this video will take you on. The photography is superb almost to the point that there are places your tummy will get a little quesy from the altitude and speed of the vehicle you are traveling in.,1355875200,2,238,4.558139534883721
5072170,5,B007AFS12W,"If you really want to enjoy this program, BluRay is the only way to experience it. I hope Smithsonian Channel will release all 50 states Aerial America episodes.",1354492800,2,161,4.785714285714286
