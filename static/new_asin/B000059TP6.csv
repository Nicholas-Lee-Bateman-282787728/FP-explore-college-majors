7934223,5,B000059TP6,"This is what I like to watch. This movie has lots of violence. I also like the action, like the pursuit with cars and motorcycle. I like the explosions. I like the stabbing. I like the punching and kicking.",1524182400,,206,4.3076923076923075
7934224,1,B000059TP6,Another stinker...we wonder why they show these things and it is probably because they 'paid per view'.....if two people watched this they made 2 bucks...so...do the math,1524096000,,170,5.333333333333333
7934225,1,B000059TP6,Poorly written didn't make any sense. Just 1 example if I KO two guys trying to kill me I would pull off their ski mask to see who they were before I left. The whole movie is full of this stuff.,1522800000,,194,3.7560975609756095
7934226,2,B000059TP6,"Ho hum!  Just another one of those old made for TV movies that padded out a long night o a network that didn't have any hit series in the time slot yet were watched because people do not know how to read or actually do stuff.  At the end of my string, I find myself watching old ""entertainment"" like this because I CAN NO LONGER READ AND DO STUFF to pass the time.  WOW, there were a lot of bad shows in the past and the dynamic streaming digital movie industry is unearthing thousands from the bottom of the hep of old shows.",1521331200,,526,4.087378640776699

7934230,2,B000059TP6,"The other glowing review about this movie fooled me into renting it. Well, I really wanted to see it because Laura Harring is in it, and she's a babe. But she doesn't save this bomb. Richard Grieco plays the same role over and over again and this flick is no different. He's an outcast with a chip on his shoulder in most of his roles and he rides a motorcycle whenever possible. This time he's a cop who left the force because he couldn't stand the rampant corruption. Yet he continues to have an affair with the police chief's wife (Priscilla Barnes in flashback). He wakes up with a hangover to find her murdered body and flees the scene. Has he been set up? Hmmmm...

This looks like it was a made for TV movie, and a B-movie at that. Small budget, third rate actors and a poor script. It's not even a made for cable movie so don't expect any hot scenes with the aforementioned Laura Harring. And I'm not a fan of foul language but it's hilarious and unrealistic when the mob guys say ""freakin'"" as an expletive. I found that hilarious. Check out Mulholland Drive and The Punisher for better views of Laura Harring.",1125360000,9,1119,4.405797101449275
