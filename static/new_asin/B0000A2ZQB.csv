1901199,2,B0000A2ZQB,"This movie CODE 7 is the story of the effort by the Mexican Army to bring down real life drug kingpin Pedro Aviles Perez, played by Jorge Reynoso. Code 7 was the name assigned to the elite team of soldiers and federal police assigned to arrest him or kill him, the latter preferred. This movie however is not that great, because for obvious reasons, movies that are made relating to true crime stories of the drug trade, they rarely stick to fact.

Its the story of Pedro Aviles' 2 friends and loyal companions in the drug business, El Gitano (The Gypsy) and El Culichi (Culichi being a nickname for those native to Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico, Sinaloa being the Sicily for Mexican mobsters). They remember their dead boss and friend Aviles, killed years before in an ambush by federal agents. They flash back to Pedro Aviles' life and his business deals, various musical numbers as is obligatory in these kind of movies (Sinaloan mobsters are fond of their traditional Banda music, they play it anywhere from parties, to funerals, as is shown in this film). A Top Comandante is sent from the Capital to bring down Aviles, he is betrayed and is killed by Clave Siete along with his companions. In real life, Pedro Aviles was shot to death by the Clave 7 team at a roadblock along with 6 persons riding in his vehicle, on September 28, 1978 outside Culiacan, Sinaloa. They killed the additional 6, in order to leave no witnesses to the betrayal done to Aviles, having considered the Comandante his ""friend"". At the end, the Comandante and others are killed in retaliation ""Godfather"" style. If true Mexican crime interests you, check this movie out, if not then avoid it. Mediocre to bad acting by all, except Reynoso who is well known in Mexico and has several of these kind of movies under his belt.",1135209600,,1798,4.6719242902208205
1901200,2,B0000A2ZQB,"Big Boss Pedro runs the drug business in town and owns the important cops.  An ""incorruptible"" colonel from the ""national state"" (don't ask me) comes down with the muscle and will to take him out.  LA CLAVE 7, or Code 7, authorizes the colonel to ""totally eliminate the objective (Big Boss Pedro) and witnesses.""

  Jorge Reynoso directs and stars as the Big Boss.  It's his directorial debut, but he has almost 200 films to his credit as an actor and I imagine he's a familiar face to Mexican audiences.  He's certainly the best thing about this run-of-the-mill thriller.  He has a certain bullish strength to him.  The rest of the actors run the gamut from despicable to awful.

  LA CLAVE 7 is the second Mexican production I've seen recently and it's the second one that is dotted with musical numbers - in bars, at the kingpin's poolside, etc.  Perhaps it's a local tradition.  They oddest musical insertion occurs during one of the kingpin's opponents wake.  Amid the sobbing women and glowering men a character says ""Don Lupe sent his music group.  You know how Tomas loved music...""  Omp-pah-pah, omp-pah-pah.

  Surprisingly, there's a sequel to this movie that again stars Reynoso.  Since his character took about twenty pounds of leads in the penultimate scene it's hard to imagine how the screenwriters managed it.",1094342400,,1326,4.882882882882883
