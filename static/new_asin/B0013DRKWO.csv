Obviously it won't replace a real life expert as He himself suggests, but it's a great resource to us folks without the luck of having one nearby.

Highly recommended.",1239926400,4,415,4.594594594594595

3105157,5,B0013DRKWO,"This is one of the best martial arts DVDs and the best Xingyi Quan DVD I have seen.  To begin with, this is one of the few martial arts videos that takes advantage of the potential of the format.  Rather than simply being a video tape on a disc, the material is broken down into logical components for easy reference and viewing.

The skill of the teacher, Liu Xiao Ling, is very apparent and he is forthcoming with the material.  He goes into the details that are so important for the correct execution of the movements.  I also like his style of presentation.  He has a very relaxed way about him and is not at all dogmatic.

3105160,5,B0013DRKWO,"Well, this video is of good quality production. I love the interview with the master and the questions presented. The only drawback is the subtitle during translation, however, that makes you pay closer attention throughout explanations. The instructions are very detailed from beginning to end and will enhance the knowledge you may have as well as for a beginner, giving tips regarding the approach, mental attitude and difficulties or things to look for when learning on your own. I'm glad I found this DVD cause I already picked up some tips which will enhance my Santi stance which in turn strengthen the rest of the moves. Also, I suffer from knee pain and this will help in focusing on the stance and stepping correctly as I develop muscle power from the stances.",1363305600,5,770,4.840909090909091
3105161,5,B0013DRKWO,"Xingyi Quan is deceptively simple.  Only five basic moves (""fists""), none of which appear to be that difficult.  However, the real power and thus difficulty, of Xingyi lies in the subtleties of the ""fists.""  This DVD provides as good an instruction as I've ever seen via DVD.  The  treatment of each ""fist"" covered the basic movement and then a section individually on the hands, stepping, breathing and finally the line drill with the proper turning.  The production values were good.
One caveat:  The best DVD is no substitute for an instructor, even if, as in my case, a person had received instruction prior.  The problem for me is that it is very difficult to correct yourself; an instructor can watch and help you make adjustments and refinements.  Thus, for me, this DVD has the limitation of helping me continue to practice the basic form of Xingyi with the hope of finding an instructor so that I might gain more proficiency in the future.",1355356800,8,948,4.766871165644171

The instruction is a lot like Xingyi itself, concise, clear cut and right to the point. Many dvds will provide you with a little information often at a price that is beyond the content, not so with this one. The information provided and the way it was presented is easily worth two or three times the cost of this dvd. I can't say enough how pleased I am with this purchase!

There is instruction in both mandarin, english voiceover in parts and subtitles in others. Occasionally, you do have to reset the english version, but I found this to be a very small thing compared to the pure awesomeness of this dvd.

There is a short history and comparison of different styles, clear instruction of basic power building and the 5 element forms done in multiple angles and shots for clear instruction. Also of use were the comments by students on the dvd on what it is like to be a student and to have gone through a bit of the process of training and how it has changed them and made them healthy. The applications section was also quite interesting to see how the art works and can flow between techniques as well as noting the humor, passion, compassion and noble character of the instructor.

Santi training is the foundation the these forms, and is how the moves are empowered.  The longer you can stand the better.  There are more techniques but they are not taught openly.  However, they are just permutations of the original five.  If you can learn Pa Qua, this would also be helpful.

There is a lot of material for beginners explained very well and in great detail. While there is a fair amount of demonstration that isn't the point of the DVD. I think the mix of lecture, instruction and demonstration is very well chosen for an instructional DVD.

If you are a complete cold-start beginner then look casually at the Applications section first so you can get some idea of what Xing Yi looks like in practice - that will make the drills much more meaningful. But learning an internal art without an instructor is going to be a real challenge.

Three things to note. This is Hebei style Xing Yi. In case it isn't obvious, the creation/destruction diagram on the menu page contains the five fists menu items within it - move the pointer right. Use your DVD's Audio button to get English voice overs.",1262131200,5,969,4.6608187134502925
