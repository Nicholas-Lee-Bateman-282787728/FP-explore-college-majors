2699162,5,B000KYJ3TU,"I already use some of the other turbo jam dvds, and since I really love them and want to work on my lower body I got this one too.  It's a great workout; intense enough to know it works, but not so much that you don't want to do it.  This is actually my favorite of the tj workouts so far because you can tell it works.
I run around all day for work so I have really nicely toned calves, however, my thighs are less than extraordinary.  However, I can already see a difference, not to mention feel it during and after the workout.
If you like tj style and want to work out your lower body, just buy this.  It's worth it.",1198022400,21,620,3.975806451612903

2699166,3,B000KYJ3TU,"I Didn't know I had to have a belt thing for my legs for half the workout. I would have payed more to have it come with the dvd. They said you don't have to have one for the workout, but its not really a workout with out it. So whats the point.",1402358400,5,244,3.6226415094339623
2699167,5,B000KYJ3TU,I really like this workout.  It is fun and almost anyone can do it.  I would recommend this to beginners and anyone who likes to have a fun workout.,1401148800,,148,4.068965517241379

don't realize the time, before you know it , the workouts over! You will LOOSE weight!",1392595200,,202,4.075
2699169,5,B000KYJ3TU,I love Chalene and am very tempted to buy TurboFire or one of the newer series because they are so fun and good workouts.,1392163200,,121,4.083333333333333
2699170,5,B000KYJ3TU,"I now have a collection of Chalene's dvd workouts and I am very happy with all of them. They are fun, effective, and do-able.",1387065600,,125,4.25
2699171,4,B000KYJ3TU,"This is a nice DVD for working the lower body. Chalene concentrates on lunges, kicks, and squats, as well as some floor work, to help your lower body. I like using the lower body band to work my hips. I think doing Turbo Jam DVDs using the band has really helped tone and firm my legs and hips. I have moved on to Turbo Fire now, and I miss that she doesn't use the lower body band as much in the Tone 30 and Sculpt 30 DVDs. Also, if you are more advanced, you can add your own upper body work while doing the lower body work the group is doing - i.e. bicep curls during squats, shoulder raises during lunges, etc. One last thing - this is the only DVD I've seen Chalene's husband in, so that was kind of neat, too.",1384473600,2,715,4.006993006993007
2699172,4,B000KYJ3TU,"Great lower body workout. It is motivating as always and I liked that Chalene's husband is also in it.  I love Turbo Jam and am a Certified TurboKick instructor, so I really like kickboxing. This one did not disappoint. All levels of fitness can adapt this as they can on all her workouts.",1376784000,,289,4.452830188679245
2699173,4,B000KYJ3TU,I had borrowed my sister in law's copy so I knew I would like it.  Turbo Jam is a better way of keeping me interested in exercising.,1367020800,,132,3.888888888888889
2699174,5,B000KYJ3TU,I recommend Chalene's Turbo videos.  She is enthusiasm without phoniness.  She keeps me motivated but keeps it real.  This Lower Body Jam video is good one to have in your workout repetoire.  It targets buns and thighs.  Whole video is about 29 minutes so you get high intensity in short time period.  I am very happy I made this purchase.,1366156800,,339,4.566666666666666
2699175,5,B000KYJ3TU,This is a great resistance band workout.  I would highly recommend it to anyone to add to their collection of workout training videos.,1365465600,,134,4.826086956521739

2699177,5,B000KYJ3TU,I love all of Chalene's workouts including this Great workout for your legs. But you will need a band to get the full effect.,1362355200,,125,4.25

2699179,5,B000KYJ3TU,Chalene's workouts are absolutely fabulous.  She makes you want to workout with all her great music selections and high energy.  I would recommend this to anyone!,1358380800,,162,5.1923076923076925
2699180,5,B000KYJ3TU,"I love the Turbo Jam videos, and this is one is no exception. It's very challenging and I always feel the burn afterward.",1357344000,,121,4.304347826086956
2699181,4,B000KYJ3TU,I like this workout when I don't want to jump a lot but still workout my lower body. I like it and am taking a break from Jillian Michaels. Good thigh toning. I always use hand wrapped weights for Body Jam and it helps tone arms with her punches.,1357171200,,246,4.040816326530612
2699182,4,B000KYJ3TU,I definitely felt my lower body the next day.  The only thing I don't like is that every one of the Turbo Jam workout has the same exact warmup.  I like a little variety.,1354838400,,170,3.9705882352941178
2699183,5,B000KYJ3TU,"THIS PRODUCT IS VERY FUN, AND YOU REALLY SWEAT ALOT. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE THAT WANTS TO HAVE FUN AND LOSE WEIGHT.",1352764800,,123,4.166666666666667

2699185,5,B000KYJ3TU,"Really great workout for lower body.  The section with the band at the end gets a good burn.  I love to use this to alternate with my workout with weights.  Great on its own or in combination with other Turbo Jam workouts. I've also used the 5 Rockin' Workouts.  All the Turbo Jam workouts are fairly easy to learn, but yet challenging to the muscles.  I don't care for ""dancey"" workouts, and these are not.  Some see Chalene as cheesy, but I think she's energetic and motivating.",1343433600,2,480,4.459770114942529
2699186,5,B000KYJ3TU,I love  love love this video. It gives me what I need whenever I pull it out. This is my old reliable video that gives me a quick jolt. I love it when I am low on my time to work out. Gives me what I need in 30 minutes.,1335312000,,219,3.38
2699187,4,B000KYJ3TU,Even without the bands I still had the intensity of my own body weight.  It is used with the ABS 20 minute work out so I can get a lot done in 30 - 35 minutes.  I will certainly buy the fat blaster next.,1324425600,,203,3.590909090909091
2699188,4,B000KYJ3TU,"I am a lover of Turbo Jam! It's def. a great workout! I really do enjoy this workout! I only gave it 4 stars, cause it can be a little hard on the knees...so if you're looking for low impact and have knee issues, you might want to rethink this. But you can always take your lunges not so deep and kicks not so high to lessen the impact. Overall it is a good lower body workout, I have already seen a difference in my thighs and my bottom!",1316995200,,438,3.932584269662921
2699189,5,B000KYJ3TU,"I know they say you can't ""spot train,"" but I really started to see my legs get thinner after using this video.  This is a serious workout; you may not be able to make it through the whole way on your first try.  Gradually build up resistance by adding weights and bands. Overall it is a really good workout.  I think it is one of the best out there.  Actually, I found this workout more difficult than the P90X lower body workout.  I plan on incorporating it more into my routine once ski season approaches.",1314316800,2,508,4.3052631578947365
2699190,5,B000KYJ3TU,I am a true Chalean Johnson fan and LOVE her workouts. After purchasing the Turbo Jam series I advaced to Turbo Fire. I must admit this workout is TOUGH for me. I have had it for a few months and I still struggle to get through it. It works though. My thighs are shrinking and I love it.,1308700800,,287,3.9655172413793105
2699191,5,B000KYJ3TU,I love Turbo Jam.  This work out is not cardio but if you want a good lower body work out that is fun and motivating than you will like this one.  You really feel  the burn in the outer thigh and butt.,1298246400,3,201,3.738095238095238
2699192,5,B000KYJ3TU,"This turbo jam is great! You need a resistance band. The band work is fun. I had a good time and I could definitely feel it in my thighs. It's not the most challenging workout but it's effective. Mainly just squats,weights and some kicks really. If you love turbo jam it's a great addition to your collection. Great for lazy days when you don't feel like jumping around.",1294876800,2,370,4.455882352941177

2699194,5,B000KYJ3TU,"I've been doing Turbo Jam for a couple of years now and I absolutely love it, I've seen great results and It has completely changed my life. I wanted to try something new, something that would help me really target those hard to tone up areas such as inner & outer thighs and butt. I've been doing this video for about 3 weeks now and I have to say, you do feel a burn especially if you use the bands. I feel like it really focuses on the legs and butt which is what I wanted. It goes by very quickly its only 30 minutes but you do feel like you're getting a great work, and you do break a sweat. Its also not too extreme so anyone can do this workout. I always have some muscle soreness the next day, I would definitely recommend this video to anyone who is trying to get their lower body is shape!",1259625600,2,799,4.031446540880503
2699195,5,B000KYJ3TU,Amazingly fast shipping! The product arrived in mint condition and arrived before the due date! Absolutely satisfied customer! Thank you!,1252886400,,137,5.9
2699196,5,B000KYJ3TU,"I have almost all the Turbo Jam series. This one definately works those legs and butt. It is still the only video that makes me sore for 2 days afterwards! I would highly recomend this dvd. It puts together legs but also comes with the resistance band to work the arms on some of the exercises. I feel like its a great workout when I am done, and its only 30 minutes.",1236124800,5,367,4.111111111111111
2699197,5,B000KYJ3TU,"I have been using this for a bit now, and I promise you it's tightening up the butt and shaping the thighs--hence the title. These are the focus areas. If you don't have resistance bands, you will need them, unless you want to use free weights (around 3-5 lbs). I recommend bands because they put more emphasis on resistance instead of just lifting. The resistance bands will work the quads, hamstrings and gluteus muscles on all sides as opposed to how just using free weights would. In other words, you have resistance on lifting the leg outward in one exercise, as well as bringing it back down because one has to control that resistance band while working it in both directions to make it effective. As long as you show that band who the boss is by maintaining tension in it, you'll see results!

Some people like the longer cardio based workouts which are great also. However, this is specifically a TARGET TONING video. It's designed for one thing and that is to target the lower body, period! If you want more of a total body workout, you'll need dvd's such as 3T, cardio party, Turbo Sculpt, etc...",1234569600,18,1106,4.585858585858586
2699198,5,B000KYJ3TU,Purchased a used DVD workout and was very impressed with quality.  Absolutely nothing wrong with DVD for little money. Love it.....,1229040000,,131,5.238095238095238
2699199,5,B000KYJ3TU,"Chalene Johnson does some great DVD's, but this one for me was okay. The routines are good, but I want a little more of a workout. As far as just doing lower body work...it is good. But if you are looking for more of a sweating workout, this might not be the one for you. I prefer to have a lot of cardio. If you are looking for more sculpting then go with maybe Turbo Sculpt. It is a longer workout. Not a bad DVD, just prefer more cardio to sculpting.",1226361600,6,453,3.989010989010989
2699200,4,B000KYJ3TU,"this is great workout.  i have not worked out for a while, so the next day i was feeling it on the back of my thighs. Even though there a weights involved this is deff a lower body work out.",1223510400,3,190,3.75
2699201,4,B000KYJ3TU,This is a quick 30 minute lower body workout.  I combine it with another 20 to 30 minute Turbo Jam workout.  I wasn't aware you needed a resistance band though when I bought it...so I grabbed one from the local hospital's physical therapy area without a problem.  Before I did that I used ankle weights I already had at home.  That worked fine...,1221696000,6,346,4.444444444444445

8159575,5,B000KYJ3TU,"I have been doing Turbo Jam workouts for years. I have the base set of DVDs with gloves. I bought this since the reviews were good. I started to play the dvd with the intention of just watching it to see how tough it would be. As usual, Chalene's energy came through the TV. Before I knew it, the workout was over! I had done the whole thing without a band and it still felt like a good workout. She will make you enjoy squats! Who does that?!?! If you are already a Turbo Jam/Chalene fan this is a great addition to what you already have. If you want a good lower body workout, this is a good one because the time will go by fast.",1482364800,,631,4.015873015873016
8159576,5,B000KYJ3TU,"Is there a Chalene Johnson workout that doesn't work? I swear this woman is a cardio genius, and one of the best program creators I have ever tried. No matter your level of fitness every workout in the TurboJam series is easily modifiable to suit your needs. So you can't do the jumps or kick, then you do a small tap. The more you do it the easier it gets. You can shed a ton of weight if you keep doing these workouts and eat low sugar, drink lots of water and get in tons of veggies. That is all I do. It is OK! if you can only do 10 minutes the first few times, just keep going - it will get easier, you will want to do it longer, and you will FEEL GOOD about yourself! Good luck!",1468368000,,684,3.892857142857143

8159580,5,B000KYJ3TU,"I LOVE this workout. A lot of the Turbo Jam workouts are a bit hyped up and lots of bouncing, but this contains great leg exercises-- lots of lunges and squats. You totally feel it the next day. I started this video hating squats and now they are actually kind of fun (yes, I did just say that). LOVE this so much I'm back on buying another DVD because my other one was ruined by my dog. PS If you use this without a resistance band, don't. They make the workout so much more amazing.",1424908800,3,484,4.105263157894737

8159583,4,B000KYJ3TU,"I am 52 and am coming back from a really bad year when I lost most of my fitness capacity. So, I'm slowly rebuilding strength and cardio capacity. So, I'm focusing on high beginner to intermediate workouts.

This workout really fits the bill for me. It is a concentrated, but not highly intense, workout that focuses on the lower body. It's the standard Turbo Jam set up - Chalene back up by multiple exercisers with two modifiers who don't use weights/band. You start out with a band around the ankles. They tied their Turbo Jam band into a loop. I used my Spri loop. With it on, you do side steps and leg lifts, etc. Then, you take it off, hold light to moderate weights and do different lunges and squats. You end up on the floor and do a little bit of floor work.

If you think that a workout needs to kill you to be effective, this workout isn't for you. If you want a workout that works the different muscles of the lower body in an effective, but not killer, way, then you might enjoy this workout. It's about 25 minutes, slightly shorter than the 30 minutes I aim for, but a good workout nontheless.

Instructor Comments: Chalene is motivating and pretty calm in this workout.",1422835200,2,1184,4.397260273972603
