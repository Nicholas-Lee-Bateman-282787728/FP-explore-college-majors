8247564,1,B0012S63EG,"Hello,

I thought this would be an informative DVD to improve my Interviewing and Interrogating skills. As the other reviewer wrote, it looked like a poorly done old movie and they did not even finish the interviews or the investigation. The whole thing just ended as if there were a second part or another disc.

HIGHLY NOT recommended.",1219363200,2,337,4.793103448275862
