8170170,4,B0001US7RW,"Even though this is an older movie, I first saw it on TV in 1979, it still has suspense and a good story line.  You will grieve with Helen (journalist) when she looses her unborn child. Helen starts to remember parts of what had happened and it's a puzzle she sets her mind to working through. You will cheer her on as she tries to get on with her life.  But things happen, that change the course of one's life and we see how Helen and her husband go through it, differently. You will be so thankful after you've watched the movie for the 'little blessings' you have in your life.",1324339200,,580,4.216216216216216
