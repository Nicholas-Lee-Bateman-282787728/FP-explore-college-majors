1879467,2,B0000950ZN,"The dance is casual and informal. It doesn't show much stylistic difference between Rumba and Cha Cha that the international style stresses. A more informative Editorial Review on the back cover should have mentioned this.
Less oral explanation and more demonstration would make the two tapes more appealing.
If you like the casual style, the package worths the price.",1067126400,2,368,5.254237288135593
1879468,4,B0000950ZN,"I have not yet openned this 2-tape set because I think it may be the same tapes as Vol. 1 and 2 of Introduction to Ballroom Dancing also by Kyle and Susan Webb, which I also bought.
Am I right?
Both sets are on the Rumba, Waltz, and Cha Cha.
Or are they different?",1026086400,3,264,3.9074074074074074
1879469,5,B0000950ZN,"The videos in this boxed set are very good, but are identical to the Ballroom Dancing - Beginning and Intermediate tapes by Kyle Webb. Don't buy both!",1018828800,27,150,4.592592592592593
1879520,5,B0000950ZN,My partner and I did not know how to dance and we find this instruction excellent and easy.  We were able to pick basic steps immediately.,1142380800,16,138,4.3076923076923075
1879521,5,B0000950ZN,Our first dance lesson DVD and we were skeptical at first - but after a short while my wife and I realized that we were actually dancing.  The dvd is clear and easy to follow. We are having fun.  The instructors are normal people who are interested in teaching -- not showing off.,1140912000,16,280,4.264150943396227
1879522,4,B0000950ZN,"This DVD has helped my wife and I become better dancers.  It features the teacher and his partner but then shows very average people of all ages dancing throughout the DVD.  Being male, I was a little intimidated by this at first but quickly lost that feeling because of the pace and teaching techniques the instructors use.  Good buy!  Only drawback is that if you rewind often to watch and practice on your own, you quickly get tired of the music being played.",1127692800,25,462,4.530120481927711
1879523,1,B0000950ZN,"Why is ballroom dancing supposed to look so old fashioned?

I was very disappointed with the quality of this dance instruction DVD. Overall it looks at least 25 years old. On Latin dances (rumba and cha-cha), the selection of music is all 80's style ... American songs. Same for the Waltz. The instructors' feet and body move too loosely all over the place; they just don't look very professional. I don't think that the instructors need to look and dance like the average Joe and Jill clients to please them. The female steps are instructed by the male instructor who brings the lady in afterwards to show the couple dancing. The party part is supposed to show an overall review of each dance with ordinary people of all ages and styles dancing, but some of those 80's look-overweight bodies, some in extremely tight and short dresses are too much. The whole thing makes you doubt if the steps are properly instructed, but at least for the Rumba, the steps are similar to those instructed in another DVD with Vicki Regan as teacher (That DVD was a better quality and a more thorough instruction). So, I guess it is OK. There are 3 levels for each dance, which is also nice compared to other DVD's. A second musical CD is provided with the DVD. The musics played on that CD are famous but there is no indication on which style of dance they are supposed to be. It is obvious for Edelweiss but the rest of it is sometimes not that easy to guess.

I wish some professional and great ballroom dancing teacher would go ahead and make something with music from recent soundtracks of movies like ""Shall we dance"". And also put some effort in the looks of the dancers and the set. After all, it is a DVD not a CD or radio sound.",1126396800,24,1721,4.4603174603174605
1879524,4,B0000950ZN,This is a great DVD for someone just learning to ballroom dance. Kyle explains how to do both the man's and ladies' steps making it extremely easy to follow. The fashions and hairstyles are a bit outdated but all in all it's a very good way to learn the basics.,1125273600,15,261,4.24
1879525,4,B0000950ZN,Great explanations on a couple of simple steps.  Easy to follow.  Only helpful for someone very new to ballroom dancing.,1122940800,8,120,4.95
1879526,5,B0000950ZN,"This DVD is head and shoulders above most other ballroom dancing instructional videos.  The production quality is high -- nice music, good lighting, smooth editing, and even real sets.  The party dance sequences are staged with ""regular"" people of all ages and skills, helping to motivate the student.  The instructions and demonstrations are smooth and easily followed. It is geared perfectly for beginners.  The ""bonus"" music CD is good, too.  Highly recommended.",1117670400,13,465,5.402777777777778
1879527,5,B0000950ZN,"I have purchased and viewed several dance CDs focusing on the Waltz, Rumba and Cha Cha.  This is the best by far.  Most others are focused on flair and professional looking dancers.  This tape is produced more for the ""common"" dancer.  It is easy to follow, the music is perfect for the beginner and intermediate and the dance instructors are easy to watch and follow.

Negative:  too much filming of a dance party before and after the lessons.  It would also be nice for all of these instructional CD to have a ""Scene Selection"" capability to allow the viewer to stop and return to the lesson of interest.",1105488000,94,606,4.555555555555555
1879528,5,B0000950ZN,"I have purchased books and DVD's based on customer reviews and based on the failure of the products do not respect the opinions of some.  I think the worst was a ""highly recommended"" that was nothing but  professional dancers showing themselves off.  (Do You Want to Dance?)  How about Darrin's Dance Groves that states ""Move to the right"" which Darrin does literally, so that the teacher and student are going ""right"" in the opposite directions?  (Darrin is a professional by today's standards which is nothing short of shocking)  Do you want to try this DVD after discovering all these mentioned horrors yourself?  Did it include even the ""Idiots Guide to Ballroom Dancing?""  (Mine was tossed out the very afternoon I got it and had a look.)  So one asks is this DVD worthy?  Yes.  They appear as ""normal"" people, the steps are clear, and especially to be noted are the obvious changes of shoes by Susan Webb.  (Ladies you must see that shoe change.  You're not going to switch all about doing different dances in a night.  You can see through Susan that your choices of dances are dependent on your shoes.)  I respect Kyle and Susan Webb as teachers.  Here is the nasty news.  It is for 40 year olds and upwards.  After ordering this you're going to order Darrin's Dance Groves, he goes to the right and you're going to change that to the left, you're going to do this in the privacy of your home, never dance any of it in public because you must GET RID OF THAT 1960's INSTINCTIVE FREELANCE SWAYING.  It's gone.  GONE.  You'll find yourself by accident trying to add a little swaying into ballroom dance.  Do you understand what I am saying?  Even if you never went to a prom or a dance like me I swear you're going to fight that indocrinated swaying.  So go learn Darrin's Digital Get Down which is robtic/puppet moves and break that old fashioned and bad sway out of yourself.  Actively fight that 1960's swaying.  You can only do that by ""modernizing"" with a vengence until ""word"" association on ""dance"" changes in your mind.",1089676800,17,2032,4.606145251396648
1879529,2,B0000950ZN,"Kyle works hard at making dancing as simple as possible, but I found the pace much too slow.  You shouldn't have time to explain things between steps 1 and 2.  Despite the ultra-slow breakdown, I didn't get a good feel for any steps before he moved on.",1085011200,2,252,4.340425531914893

7989566,5,B0000950ZN,"The item was as advertized . I use it almost every evening, so I can learn the Ballroom Dance's. I am well pleased with the DVD, and I will buy from them again. I enjoy it very much. Thanks.",1474761600,,190,3.8974358974358974

7989568,1,B0000950ZN,This was BORING.  Repeated same steps for all dances.  The Rumba is QQS not SQQ.  They do the rumba box exactly like the Waltz.  The best part of the dvd was watching the people dance in the beginning and end.,1232582400,,209,4.15
7989569,4,B0000950ZN,"The video is easy to understand, and steps are taught throughly and clearly. The video was new and unused as described.",1223251200,,119,4.714285714285714

It is rather short and cheesy.  Sorry, just my opinion.",1215820800,2,133,4.5
7989571,5,B0000950ZN,"Nice selection of dances. Instructor gives slow, detailed instruction and review of steps for both the man and woman. Musical sections for each dance at the end of each lesson allow you to practice the steps. This is a very good video for beginners.",1193011200,3,249,4.681818181818182
7989572,5,B0000950ZN,"This is a great DVD that I use to review and practice with the things that I learned at my lessons. It is included in the box set ""Dance the Night Away"" also. The individual DVD included a CD of music to dance to.",1179446400,2,213,3.8636363636363638
7989573,1,B0000950ZN,"I read the other reviews here and was compelled to add my two cents.  If this is the best out there in instructional video for ballroom dance, we really need to change that by begging those polished, thoughtful teachers out there to PLEASE create something for the dedicated desperate students seeking solid sources for dance instruction!  Not everyone, especially those living in remote rural areas, has access to a host of qualified teachers.

Unfortunately, the material on this production misses the mark.  The overall presentation lacks the sort of grace one would expect to see from professional dance teachers. This couple plods and stomps through a few basic figures like two first time, new students who have yet to find the fluidity and body awareness that will come with training and practice.

I am not suggesting that an instructional video needs to showcase the narcissistic vanity of some performer turned teacher; but a competent, clean basic technique is a reasonable expectation of one's teacher.

The couple confounds this viewer when the man, despite having his able bodied female partner present, he runs through the leader's part of the figures, shoves her off to the side instead of working as a team with her.  While she's awkwardly silently waiting, he demonstrates the woman's footwork and figures himself, like she's not a player for his one man show.  Why can't she demonstrate the lady's footwork for the pattern?  He does every part while she stands awkwardly out of his way.

Overall:  I suspect that your money would be wasted on this instructional resource.

The cd included with the dvd also falls short of the satisfactory mark.  It is outdated and reminds me of elevator music.",1165190400,21,1713,5.010600706713781
7989574,1,B0000950ZN,"If you are an absolute beginner and have never danced at all before, then you may find this course to be helpful.  Otherwise, there are better instructional videos out there. The technique and style demonstrated are not of professional calibre.  Also, the course claims to demonstrate 30 patterns.  The number is nowhere near that, and is closer to 15, total (almost 5 basic patterns per dance).  I say almost, because in one of the patterns, he calls the exit of the step by another pattern name. Sadly, the pattern name he uses is nothing like the pattern known in most dance circles.  However, the audio CD which is included is quite good.",1149379200,17,642,4.696428571428571
