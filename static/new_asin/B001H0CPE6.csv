8307563,4,B001H0CPE6,"Breathtaking images, for the first time Antonioni's career in color.  I'd be happy to have still frames from this framed on my wall.  But the acting and writing didn't match the power of the images for me, at least on first viewing.

Monica Vitti is a housewife losing her mind, who quickly (and without clear reason) obsesses a badly dubbed Richard Harris, who is visiting Vitti's husband on business.  What makes this less powerful for me than L'Venturra and L'Ecisse is here the characters talk a lot more, and a lot of the dialogue is stilted and false sounding; way too full of `meaning' when the images are already so symbolic.  And while Vitti is a good actress, she's not Liv Ulmann or Meryl Streep.  But where it fails as drama, it's amazing as storytelling through images.  Every time everyone shut up, I was immediately drawn back in.",1297468800,,845,4.668918918918919
