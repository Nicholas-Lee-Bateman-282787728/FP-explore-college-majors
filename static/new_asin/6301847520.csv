7816520,4,6301847520,"It's enjoyable if you aren't expecting a typical Hollywood FX or action flick.  It's a jewel theif / comedy movie.  The story and humor are entertaining by themselves.  It's clear that this movie was made with very little money, but Christopher Lloyd, Christopher Lambert, and the production staff pull this movie off.  JT Walsh is here too and delivers a flawless performance.  But, it's nothing more than what it tries to be, which is a funny story about two dim witted low-lifes.  Very Three-Stooges-esk.  I give it 4 stars for doing so much with so little!",1135036800,5,560,4.770833333333333
