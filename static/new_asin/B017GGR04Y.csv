As an SLP myself, Ive always been a huge believer in using visual tools to assist language learning for students. I appreciate that these visuals are real photographs. They are combined with printed words for maximum learning and early literacy. These shows have been a valuable teaching tool and have helped me achieve language literacy goals for my students. Animation Station 3 & 4 audio-visual shows are an excellent extension of Animation Station 1 & 2.",1490313600,,582,4.948979591836735
8739119,5,B017GGR04Y,"Love, love, love these songs and videos.  I work with autistic kids, language delayed kids and kids with social skill issues.  They all love the songs and videos.  These have helped with attention focus and joint attention as well.  The children sing along because the rates are slow enough and the visuals appealing.  Rachael Arnston is a gifted SLP and has really come up with some valuable tools for us to use.  These are great for Preschool classrooms as well!",1489622400,,464,4.7375
8739120,5,B017GGR04Y,"Just as good as Animation Station 1 & 2.  I had to have more.  The kids absolutely love them.  The songs, with real photography, make speech therapy so engaging.  This author, a speech pathologist, got it right!  Speech and language practice paired with simple tunes seems to get glued into the brain.  I use them on the promethean board with a whole group of preschoolers and get 100% participation.  Also, because key words are printed, and presented repeatedly, kids are reading as a by product to oral language.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT",1476662400,,534,4.791208791208791
