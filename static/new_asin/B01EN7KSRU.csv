7738834,5,B01EN7KSRU,Amazing!!,1468886400,,9,9.0
7738835,3,B01EN7KSRU,"I am a fan of the music, but never knew much of his life which is told as a flashback which divided itself into two parts: the missing years and a flashback to when he was on top of his game. We see his fall due his marriage emulating that of Ike and Tina Turner. Miles was a big boxing fan with a hip disease and love of cocaine. The flashbacks were easy to follow, we have the later "" ""fro"" period preceded by a more clean cut period. The viewer needs to catch on fast because it flashes back and forth at irregular intervals, sometimes just a matter of seconds as we watch him attempt to steal his music back for much of the film.

The film was less of a biopic and one designed to capture the essence of Davis, his hectic unorganized life juxtaposed by his overly organized music. That it did, although I wish they had more of his music.

Guide: F-word, sex, and nudity.",1468108800,,874,4.165680473372781
7738836,5,B01EN7KSRU,"Don Cheadle reincarnates Miles Davis in this film. Biopics are not my favorites but I love Miles' music because who doesn't. But Cheadle is mesmerizing. I can't wait to watch it again. McGregor is also very good. The sets are perfect, capturing the laid back, hazy 70s rather than the stark shiny reproductions of this era that we commonly see today. Corinealdi is beautiful and captivating too. They wardrobed her perfectly",1467936000,,424,4.985915492957746
7738837,2,B01EN7KSRU,why not explore the genius and the musical creation ? This movie is about drugs and the black side and a little bit of romance. The actors are great but the movie is disappointing.,1467849600,3,180,4.323529411764706
7738838,2,B01EN7KSRU,"Don Cheadle is an amazing actor and I thought he could pull this off.  And the film succeeds on a few points: acting, cinematography. What's lacking here is compelling, resonating, inspired (or inspiring) storytelling. Not that there aren't plenty of Miles Davis ""stories"" within this. The episodes that dramatize moments from Davis's life work effectively independently and also independently provide a pastiche, an impression of the life of Miles Davis. That's not entirely a bad thing, and these scenes could have worked in a better film.. But the central story -- about the struggle of an artist who was at a creative and personal crisis, and how that crisis is resolved, is not convincing. Personally, I'd have preferred more dialogue, less car chase. Cheadle chose to play with the narrative and I have no issue with that. I don't believe the film needed to be a biopic, and I championed Cheadle's choice to create an ""artistic impression"" long before the film came out. To that end, I would never argue that Cheadle should have stuck to facts. But the real story of the Miles Davis gradual comeback (involving Cicely Tyson and the patient intervention of record producer George Butler) is, for me, far more compelling than this imagined one. The film's conclusion suggests that *something* brought Davis out of long retirement. That could have made for interesting storytelling, but that element is not in the film. Yes, Davis admired his Sketches of Spain period, and yes he loved Frances and put her on his album covers, and yes he was mean to her and lost her. But there's nothing in all *that* (in the context of this film) that presents it as a catalyst for his making his comeback. It's just window shopping the life of Miles Davis, not going inside. I also don't need everything tied up with a bow, but there's not much to take away from this movie when you reach the end. I've been a hardcore fan of everything Miles has done from the 1940s to the 80s. So you don't have to sell me on Miles. But I would never recommend this film to anyone to demonstrate why Miles was brilliant and worthy of a motion picture about his life. I think Cheadle could have made a completely fictitious movie and done more to help us understand Miles the man, and Miles the musician. I got little of either.  I've been glad to see some important members of the jazz community and others, like Dick Gregory, coming forward with less-than-stellar reviews. Don Cheadle is amazing. I trusted him to do something amazing with the life of Miles Davis. I had hoped to rave about this film, about Cheadle making bold choices, but...  I felt bad after this movie. Disappointed and a little sad.",1464739200,16,2679,4.72008547008547

Plus, my hubby's scene in the jail flashback as Miles' lawyer, Harold, sealed the deal for me! :)  Too bad they didn't leave in more of my baby's scene, but at least he got a line and a walk across the big screen!

7738841,5,B01EN7KSRU,"Brilliant performance, story....and Cheadle made Miles into a gangster, for the fun of it!  Clever indeed.  And the music...wow, all features of this film are outstanding!",1462924800,4,171,5.538461538461538
7738842,4,B01EN7KSRU,"""Miles Ahead"" (2015 release; 100 min.) is a movie about the jazz legend Miles Davis. As the movie opens, we are in 1980, and Miles is being interviewed, and comments to the reporter: ""Don't call my music jazz, it's social music!"". It's not long before another reporter, Rolling Stone's Dave Braden, chases down Miles, to write a ""come-back story in Miles' own words"". We then go back to the 1950s, as Miles is breaking big. One day he meets Francis, and he is immediately smitten with her. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this movie is a labor of love AND a tour-de-force by Don Cheadle, who stars in the title role and directs, and he also co-wrote the script and co-produced. His performance as Miles Davis is spot-on, and towers above everyone else (apologies, Ewan McGregor as the Rolling Stone reporter, and sorry also, Emayatzy Corinealdi as Frances). Cheadle's brilliant performance covers up the somewhat confusing back-and-forth between the ""present"" (i.e. late 70s) and the flashbacks in the 50s. Please note that ""Miles Ahead"" is not a bio-pic (overview of Davis' life), nor is it intended as one. Cheadle (whose vision for the film was fully supported by the Miles family) simply picked two periods of Miles' life and attempts to give us a flavor of what Miles Davis the man was like. At that, I think Cheadle succeeds. If you don't care for the music of Miles Davis, by all means avoid this film, as it is chockfull of outstanding music (check out the excellent soundtrack, available here on Amazon). Last but not least, I would be remiss if I didn't point out that 95% of the movie was shot on location here in Cincinnati. Yes indeed, just like Todd Haynes' film ""Carol"" a few months ago, there are certain sections of Cincinnati that apparently easily stand in for New York back in the day.

""Miles Ahead"" finally opened a few weeks ago at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and the Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended quite nicely. I doubt that this movie is going score huge at the box office, but hopefully it'll find some legs at the art-house theater circuit. If you are curious to find out more about Miles Davis, or simply want to admire the stellar performance of Don Cheadle, you cannot go wrong with ""Miles Ahead"", be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1462838400,16,2498,4.71395881006865

7738849,1,B01EN7KSRU,"I am a huge fan of Don Cheadle, and unfortunately dramatic roles are few and far between for black men.  So I was really looking forward to seeing him in this role.  However, the film was a great disappointment.  His talent simply could not shine with such a one dimensional character, particularly because Miles apparently spoke in a whisper.  It's hard for anyone to whisper their way through a dramatic role.  Plus, the only thing I learned from this film is that Miles Davis swore a lot, was angry a lot, did drugs a lot, and was washed up long before his time.  In short, his biography was completely unoriginal, because that seems to describe almost every other celebrity that movies are made about.  Overall, if you don't like jazz or biographies about angry, swearing, drug abusing music makers, then you won't like this film.",1487116800,,834,4.710344827586207

7738910,4,B01EN7KSRU,"I found the film to be IIMPRESSIONS OF MILES. If you've seen I""M NOT THERE, which was about Dylan, it was the same thing. Cheadle created a character study, not a biopic, to explore Miles the person. Within this framework he displays Miles compositions to great effect. Parts of the film, like when Miles and the Rolling Stone reporter (McGregor) are chasing around Harlem, Mile's early 70s fusion music was playing in the backround. It draws connections between BIG FUN or ON THE CORNER, with the blackploitation films of the time. Of course, the 50s work, Naima, or songs from Sketches of Spain, is the emotional soundscape for the romance. I wish there were some way that each song's title were to flash on the screen, but then again, part of the fun of watching a film like this for a fanboy like myself, is figuring out what song you're hearing.  People bashed this film, and I admit there are flaws. The lost session tape framework was a bit trite. In fact, its lifted from Paul McCartney's GIVE MY REGARDS TO BROAD STREET, which nobody thinks is Paul's most shining moment. However, McCartney's film was an excuse to play lots of Paul's favorite songs, and that seems to be the rationale for MILES AHEAD as well.

  Not much is made of Miles paintings during his retirement after 1975, which was a disappointment for me. However, if Cheadle didn't keep a tight focus on what he wanted to say, the movie would have spun out of control. Miles was a multifaceted person. Not just a boxing enthusiast, or a lover of beautiful women, or a junkie, or a painter, or composer, or iconoclast, or a black man facing discrimination. He was the amalgamation of these things, and that was Cheadle's point. Plus, this still leaves room for a definitive Miles cinematic Biography. I'd love to see a movie just focus on Miles relationship with Coltrane, or Miles in the late 60s, as the second great quintet discovered jazz fusion, and Betty Marby updated Miles to the hippie scene. At the end of the film, there's a special treat. That second great quintet, or what's left of it, jammed away. Herbie Handcock and Wayne Shorter, along with some top jazz players like Esmeralda Spalding on bass, bringing Miles to life better than any actor can....thru his music.",1472947200,5,2253,4.69620253164557

7738976,2,B01EN7KSRU,"Don Cheadle's ""not a bio-pic"" of Miles Davis hits wrong notes on a number of different levels.  Let me first mention another reviewer who pointed out all the great music in the film and invited you to look at the soundtrack as proof.  Go ahead; look at the soundtrack.  You will see that the soundtrack CD doesn't really have much Davis music on it!!  It has a few full Miles Davis compositions, edits/excerpts of others, dialogue excerpted from the film and tunes by other folks.  The CD is certainly NOT proof of anything significant in terms of Davis' music in the film.  And, that's another problem.  The film is fictional; supposedly Cheadle's attempt to create a story that would give us the essence of the man if not a true biography.  Well, folks, if the strongest image of Miles Davis you want to have is that of a near lunatic strung out on drugs and booze, then, by all means, love this movie . . . . even if, again, the whole story of a Rolling Stone journalist helping a gun-wielding Miles Davis recover a reel of tape with new music from Columbia Records execs with gun-wielding flunkies who want the music as part of Davis' contract with Columbia is totally fictitious!!  Where is Miles Davis the musical genius in all of this?  NOWHERE!!  In the film, Cheadle's Davis has a obsessive affection for his Sketches of Spain and Someday My Prince Will Come albums; yet, you'd be hard pressed to find much music from either album in the film.  THIS IS NOT A FILM ABOUT A MUSICAL GENIUS AND THE MUSIC HE CREATED (sorry, I'm shouting); and, that is the biggest shame.  Those of us who have loved his music over these many years and, especially, those who might be turned on to his music if they only had a proper introduction to the man and his art will find NOTHING (Did I say that already?) here. Yes, Miles Davis did go through a fallow period fueled by addictions; but, is a fictitious ""not a bio-pic"" the proper way to present that?  I'm all for innovative, off-the-wall storytelling/film making; but, please, experiment and innovate to a purpose.  You ain't gonna see that here.  And, by the way, didn't Paul Simon already make a film about a musician on an enraged quest to steal back from his studio a reel of music?  It was called One Trick Pony.",1469318400,3,2263,4.507352941176471
7738977,2,B01EN7KSRU,"This was hard to watch and it's equally hard to verbalize why I didn't like it.  In short, it's was just like ""Bird""...focused completely on the personal troubles and sensational moments and leaving all of his genius and contributions out of the story.  A staunch Mile's fan who has read his autobiography might be able to enjoy it as it was intended but I am that person and all I could do was remain upset at what was being put forward.  I kept thinking, ""this is what they want people to think about this guy and guys like him...that they were troubled drug addicts first and musical geniuses second""  That just makes me so angry.  I could go on and on but suffice to say that this movie didn't celebrate Miles at all.  Not a bit.  There was no nod to his enrollment to Juliard, no nod to his drive , no nod to his ability to spot talent or to create new music trends.  It all took a back seat to the reclusive black dude who dated white chicks and drove Ferraris and Lambos.  Don Cheadle should be ashamed and frankly so should Wayne Shorter and Herbie Hancock for doing cameos at the end.  They weren't celebrating him they were dancing on his grave.  If you don't know what I mean or think that I'm being too critical than watch the new Jaco doc by Robert Trujillo.  It doesn't shy away from his troubled times but it always remains respectful to his genius and contribution.

8759215,3,B01EN7KSRU,"It's always good to see an endangered music receive attention, whatever the source.  Don Cheadle, as Miles Davis, is a pleasant surprise, capable of representing Miles at his music best and worst.  But the music invented by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk represented a departure from the popular music of the day, which was ""swing"" played by the big bands. The Swing Era in itself featured trained, professionally competent musicians, but the new music--called ""bebop""--was a more complicated ""take"" on the melodies, harmonies and rhythms of the two leading musical structures--the 12-bar blues and the 32-bar ""Standard""-- that were the basis of the big band repertory.  The new music was--whether by choice or accident--of sufficient difficulty to ""weed out"" all of the pretenders, regardless of their value as entertainers or creative artists.

When Miles Davis left East St. Louis to play trumpet in the Billie Eckstine Big Band in the mid-'40s, he was an average musician among jazz giants.  But he would work on his trumpet skills, coming to New York to study at Juilliard, where he became a player who, though never known for fluid and flawless technique (musicians would joke about his recorded ""clams""), became respected as an instrumentalist who had acquired a recognizable, influential ""voice"" on his instrument--a personal quality that would translate into his ability to attract the very best musicians to his groups and to reach the ears of the listening public through his appearances and recordings.

Miles had, above all, special gifts for presentation and presentiment.  The former was seen, initially, in his stylish dress and deportment on stage (acquired from studying Lawrence Olivier, Sinatra and Orson Welles as much as other jazz players; later in his career, it was his casual wear and even outlandish costumes and huge sunglasses that made him a welcome act in rock emporiums like the Filmore East).  His sense of the next trend in the music, which he always seemed eager to take credit for, was seen, initially, in his association with the West Coast, primarily ""white,,"" style of jazz called ""cool jazz""; by the mid-50s his group was viewed as the paramount example of East Coast jazz, known as ""hard bop.""  Next, he became identified with the ambitious orchestrations (incorporating flutes, double-reed instruments, French horns and tuba) of Gil Evans, in no fewer than three ""mini-concertos,"" beginning with ""Miles Ahead"" and ending with arguably his best: ""Sketches of Spain.""  But it was in 1959 that Miles left his deepest mark on the music when, with the help of his former piano player, Bill Evans, he recorded ""Kind of Blue"" (every week among the top ten most popular jazz recordings).  ""Blue"" supplemented the traditional chord progressions of jazz with Ancient Greek modes, or scales, which tended to ""free up"" the improvising soloist.

Ten years later Miles would release on Columbia / Sony ""Bitches Brew,"" the first example of ""fusion music,"" or a blending of jazz and rock.  This is the point at which the movie takes up its story about Miles, who began to let his trumpet technique slide from this moment to the end of his life.  The magnetism of Miles Davis was so great that Teo Macero, the main jazz promoter at Columbia records,  would take pains to cut and snip, edit and re-edit the most marginal studio recording into acceptable albums on the major label.  The attempt to tell a story about Miles based on a ""priceless composition"" is practically ludicrous given the extremely extemporaneous and free-form quality of a music reduced to its most basic elements.  To those of us who joined up with Miles much earlier, his most significant accomplishments after 1970 were his retrospective gestures toward the timeless art of the past--rather than any progressive or futuristic development in the music.

I saw Miles for the last time in the 1980s when his group was the first half of a concert that featured the Marsalis Brothers on the 2nd half.  It felt like a journey from disappointing (if occasionally humorous) amateurism to technically accomplished but sterile professionalism.  Miles wore shades that were a foot in diameter and limited his musical contributions to looking at the floor while pumping a wah-wah pedal that was altering the limited musical sounds of his trumpet.  It's troublesome, especially now when amateur pop groups devote more time to acquiring ""viral fame"" than learning how to play their instruments or to make the sacrifices required of any genuine artist, to see so much emphasis given to a period in Miles' career during which his health and music were both in precipitous decline. Fans of late Miles may be doing the music of Louis and Duke, Bird and Coltrane an injustice by their advocation of an electronically-altered ""dance"" music as an invitation for anyone with a horn to begin tootin' and pumpin'.

The Miles I became familiar (beginning with the unforgettable Columbia album, ""Round Midnight,"" was relatively conservative in his tastes and influence.  He selected at least half his repertoire from ""The Great American Songbook"" and he worked hard on his range and articulation to match and arguably surpass the playing of trumpeter Red Rodney, who in 1949 had replaced him in the Charlie Parker Quintet.  Miles in the '50s led jazz critics to revaluate the ""standards"" favored by pianist Ahmad Jamal, who had up to that point been dismissive of Jamal's music as ""cocktail music.""  And toward the end of his career--the late '80s--he brought to the public's attention the exquisite interpretations of the Songbook by pianist-singer Shirley Horn.  Known as a Washington D. C. local attraction, it was Miles' summons of her to NYC  that brought her public recognition and one of the music's most scintillating recordings, featuring Horn's voice and piano along with the orchestrations (called a ""scrim"" by the orchestrator) of former Sinatra arranger Johnny Mandel.  As his days became increasingly numbered, Miles was most receptive to an invitation to reprise his timeless music that he had with Gil Evans' Orchestra in the late '50s, just prior to the legendary ""Kind of Blue"" session with pianist Bill Evans. Miles' last recording was an endeavor to perform for the Montreux jazz festival some of the scintillating music of these tone poems, or ""jazz concertos,"" recorded for Columbia, 1956-58 (the first was ""Miles Ahead,"" followed by ""Porgy and Bess"" and ""Sketches of Spain"").  As this final recording evidences, his chops weren't quite up to the challenge (a 2nd trumpeter, Wallace Roney, stood alongside Miles to cover the high notes), yet it serves as a reminder than the sound, the style, the voice of the music's most seminal modernist will never go away.

Miles Davis was the Pablo Picasso of jazz--not because of some ""written"" (or even oral) composition (a fictional ploy for a Hollywood movie), but because 1. His character and personal influence enabled him to ""get out in front"" of every new direction in jazz, 1948-1970.  In fact, he became synonymous with the 2nd half of jazz history--bebop, cool bop, hard bop, progressive orchestral jazz, modal jazz, ""free"" jazz (i.e. not formless but the extreme expressive liberties granted his ""2nd Great Quintet""), and fusion music--from the ""jazz-rock"" of 1968 to the analog jazz-funk of the '70s to the digital synthesis apparent in the jazz-pop of the '80s (disco, Michael, Stevie. And then, like the archetypal hero of a Joseph Campbell myth, Miles came full circle, returning to the challenging music of his beginnings.

As dissatisfying as ""Miles Ahead"" is to those fans of Miles who have all of his early Prestige and Columbia recordings (plus ""Somethin' Else"" on Blue Note), if it plays well to young millennials and encourages them to discover Miles' personal voice and timeless art as a trumpet player, it will have earned our admiration.",1531008000,,7929,5.094135802469136
8759216,1,B01EN7KSRU,Absolute garbage; fictional nonsense that never occurred.  This was a disgraceful attempt to paint Miles as something he was not - a gangsta.  I will never watch anything with Don Cheadle's name on it ever again. What can you expect from a guy who said his favorite Miles album is CIRCLE IN THE ROUND which was a collection of tracks that were outtakes from other sessions over a 15 year period of Miles' rapid trajectory career?  Really? Circle in the Round?  Idiot.  Disgrace to this very important American cultural figure and his legacy.  So bad I could not finish it.  The gunshot in the Columbia producer's office was so obviously co-opted from the James Brown incident that got him thrown into jail.  BAD BAD BAD.,1522713600,,720,4.704

8759220,4,B01EN7KSRU,"So, the story has actually very little to do with Mile's life or career. It is a highly fictionalized adventure, with Miles turned into a sort of comic book character. It is a sort of interesting pseudo-action jaunt with Miles' music as the soundtrack. The music makes it worth it.",1516665600,,281,4.64
