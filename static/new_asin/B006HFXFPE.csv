4989352,3,B006HFXFPE,"This is a great set of Barney DVDs perfect for any Barney fan.  With three full DVDs for less than $20 you really can't go wrong!  The DVDs features Barney, BJ, Riff, and Baby Bop along with fun animals, letters, and the world!  My boys (3 and 5 years old) watched the DVDs and danced around with Barney and his friends.  They love the silly songs and that there are real kids on the show.  I should add too that since these DVDs have already been released years ago, you should make sure you don't have them already if you are buying this set.",1330300800,,544,4.1923076923076925
