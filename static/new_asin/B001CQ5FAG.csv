8288663,4,B001CQ5FAG,I thought it was very informative. Being born and raised in Portland ore. I never realized that this was the oldest black church in Portland Ore. I think you have to be from Portland to understand the significance of the DVD.,1511654400,,225,4.512195121951219
8288664,4,B001CQ5FAG,Disappointed. It was not what I expected. At the end it turns into a full blown church service. Title is deceptive.,1461283200,,115,4.523809523809524
8288665,2,B001CQ5FAG,"Although it was accurate, it lacked continuity and depth.  It left out some valuable facts such as the AME Church and the fact that most Black church's used African in their names. It also had no reference to scholarly work in this area by other African Americans writers.  It seemed to be prolog for the Mt. Olivet Church and a serious presentation of th Black church experience.",1456531200,,380,4.656716417910448
8288666,1,B001CQ5FAG,This is the most disappointing so called documentary I've ever seen.,1413331200,,68,5.2727272727272725
8288667,5,B001CQ5FAG,Excellent,1405209600,,9,9.0
8288668,5,B001CQ5FAG,Great! An excellent addition to your collection if you are interested in black church studies.  I recommend this DVD for anyone who is interested in learning more about black church studies.  It does a good job and examining the historical information and examining the sociological context of the rising of a black church.,1343692800,,323,5.0754716981132075
8288669,1,B001CQ5FAG,"I ordered a copy of this DVD a year ago, but never recieved a copy. I contacted the seller, but never recieved a response. Plus, I seen a trailer of this DVD on Youtube. It looked homemade and tacky. Very unprofessional.",1333584000,,220,4.390243902439025
