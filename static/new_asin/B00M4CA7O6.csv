8670226,5,B00M4CA7O6,"One has to have an appreciation for Berg to enjoy this opera, but the cast is magnificent. This one calls for multi-talented people who can sing, act, and look very impressive. Not for the 300 lb soprano.",1462924800,4,204,4.54054054054054

8670228,4,B00M4CA7O6,"Having just seen the new Met production with Marlis Petersen in the title role (ostensibly for the last time) , here is my brief comparison. For the first two acts, the Hannigan/Warlikowski production is at least as good as the Petersen/Kentridge (live) effort. Notwithstanding Petersen's long experience with the role, I found Hannigan's understanding  and presentation of Lulu to be at least as good and (where appropriate) even sympathetic. Only in the last act was the Met presentation superior, because the busyness of the Warlikowski production tended to obscure the downward spiral that ends the opera. The third act of the Met production was not not particularly artful, but it was grimly effective.",1449705600,6,707,5.256637168141593
8670229,1,B00M4CA7O6,"I had never seen Lulu but knew it was famous.  I can understand the complexities of such a character and how the 12 tone composition can bring it out.  However, this production was horrid.  It was gross, unnecessarily sexually explicit, had strange goings on around the stage that added just plain lust and distraction and had children, children on stage (one lifting her tutu to expose her underwear) and others watching this porn on stage.  In the notes the lead singer claims that Lulu was totally honest and knew how to love.  She had fallen in love with the character.  This Lulu is a pure sociopath along with most of the other characters.  Sociopaths are not the stuff of art and especially opera.  They are for maximum security prisons.  This video should have an X rating and the vice squad should have raided the place where it was performed.

My daughter walked in and asked what I was watching.  Trash.  Sordid trash that peddles sex and antisocial behavior.

Amazon should post a warning as it is listed ""not rated.""",1432598400,2,1029,4.681564245810056

8670231,2,B00M4CA7O6,"I know Berg's LULU.  I've seen it in the major opera houses of the world.  I got this new version as I wanted to see Hannigan as LULU.  I wasn't prepared for the perfect example of what opera friends refer to as a EUROTRASH Production.  Well this is it.  The ponderous attempt at directing never works, the story line, well god only knows where that one is, some of the singing is less than mediocre.... and quite honestly, the direction even for Hannigan is so pretentious, it is not worth having this dvd.  I only wish I had never gotten it.",1426291200,4,543,4.326732673267327
8670232,4,B00M4CA7O6,"Director Krzystof Warlikowski's work here and elsewhere has a brimming, unedited quality, as if he is throwing a lot of things at the wall and keeping everything that sticks and some of what does not. He is 52 at this writing, and I would have guessed younger. There is much that dazzles and entrances in this staging of Berg's opera, taped October 2012 at La Monnaie, but it probably is not an ideal introduction to LULU. It is difficult to tell where Berg's weirdness leaves off and Warlikowski's picks up, and even though I was coming to it familiar with LULU, having seen more than one prior production, I found myself consulting a synopsis a few times. The production gives us more to see than can be apprehended in a single viewing, either of the video release or in the theater. The poor video director (""poor"" as in ""overtaxed"") tries hard, and some points actually may have a clarity they did not have for the live audience, for example, the complex staging of the Painter's pre-suicide breakdown. While Lulu and Dr. Schn are carrying on in the foreground, the Painter is in the background composing obscene declarations of love on an iPhone and holding them up to a webcam. The webcam feeds to a bank of nine video screens. The video coverage allows us to get the argument, the text messages, and tenor Tom Randle's intense expressions; I wonder how well this worked in the theater. But at other points, Warlikowski floods the stage with unscripted business on the perimeter, usually involving dancers, many of them small children (Lulu as failed dancer is one of the conceptual underpinnings). At some points the video director, I imagine like the audience in Brussels, seems stumped as to where to look.

It is, nonetheless, quite the spectacle. Warlikowski is in thrall to popular culture, and his images evoke everything from CBGBs-era Deborah Harry, to PARIS IS BURNING-era drag, to Heath Ledger in THE DARK KNIGHT (the unraveling Schn gives himself a Joker smile with lipstick). Act One ends with a long, music-free sequence in which Lulu observes with envy and admiration a ballerina's captivating Black Swan, culminating in the ballerina's collapse -- so, BLACK SWAN and the Rebekah del Rio musical number from MULHOLLAND DRIVE in a single stroke. There are impressive projections, and a swanky principal set of a high-ceilinged apartment with a sliding glass cage on rails, what looks like an escalator at stage right but more like a staircase with a sliding board on either side (the Athlete drags the Schoolboy down it for their initial appearance). Stage directions are frequently disregarded, and this is not the LULU for anyone who wants literal sense. It is the sort of production in which someone might fret ""My husband's coming back!"" when the husband has been sitting at a table a few feet away the whole time, ""hidden"" people and acts are right there in view, and a suicide that ""should"" take place behind a locked bathroom door takes place in that glass cage, in full view of the other characters, so the ""shocking discovery"" should be neither shocking nor a discovery. I would not even have been able to guess from the way it is enacted here that the Black Man kills Alwa at the end -- clues to this are all in the dialogue, not in the stage action. The Painter is only seen taking photographs. The production is not in period; it takes place in some abstract/timeless sphere where technology is very modern but cholera is still a big health concern, Paris is teetering on the brink of revolution, and people read newspapers. We are put on notice of the waywardness very early: The opera begins with a long recitation of the Lilith legend, read by the Ringmaster, who wears a grotesque mask, a dress over a body stocking, and stilettos.

Warlikowski has a good cast, and every member seems to be giving his or her all to honoring both Berg's music and Warlikowski's concepts. It is a minor distraction that the baritone in the important role of Dr. Schn (Dietrich Henschel) looks, sounds, and is younger than his son, Alwa (Charles Workman, whose surname suggests his diligence, with an unlovely sound). Franz Mazura, in the celebrated Chreau and Dexter productions of yore, is hard to shake off when one thinks of Schn. If an old man's depravity and self-loathing could be given human form, it would have looked and acted like that. I rather like Natascha Petrinsky's Countess, which is earthier, stronger, and sexier than the weepy ruin that is usually made of the role, but the staging cheats her a bit. There is more opportunity for honest emotion in this role than in any other in the opera, and Warlikowski seems uninterested in mining that. He actually seems more interested in the plight of the poor benighted Painter, and Randle is magnetic in that part; one misses him when he goes. Pavlo Hunka brings notes of dark menace to Schigolch, no comedic wheezing here.

Of course, the show belongs to Barbara Hannigan in the title role, and ""fearless"" is the best word for her work. For once, every bit of the promise of a wild, savage animal in the Ringmaster's introduction is delivered upon; only the best prior Lulus will not pale in the memory, seem robotized by comparison. If anything at all here intimidated her -- the challenging musical idiom, the length of the role, the daunting additional layers with which Warlikowski ups the ante -- it does not show. She has to sing very difficult music while moving about the stage en pointe, a crazy idea, but she does it. She also plays several scenes barely dressed, and she obviously did not stint on her fitness regimen in preparing. When it is all over, one feels that hating this character would be like hating a caged animal in the zoo, and this is a tribute to Hannigan's honesty, her rigorousness in confronting a grueling role in a production to match, finding the through-line, the immutable truth. When she *is* dressed, she models a rainbow of wigs color-coordinated with her costumes (those are by Malgorzata Szczesniak, and as eye-catching as everything else in the physical design).

Under the baton of Paul Daniel, the Orchestre symphonique de la Monnaie makes Berg's score sound like the place Romanticism went to die a lingering death. This is intended as a compliment.

I have never seen a DVD of this opera that gets all of its chattering into the titles, and that may not be possible with all the cross-talk and ensemble work, but there are two significant lapses in the captions here, one on each disc. Both go on long enough that one fears the translation may not return. It is as though the transcriber just fell asleep on the job. Again, have a synopsis or libretto handy if you take the plunge on this.

The summing-up: An idiosyncratic staging filled with ideas, many of them good, but too many of them, and emotionally cooler than it needs to be; musically superb; a singing/acting performance of mad genius at the center, surrounded by other excellent ones. Perhaps a DVD to return to and live with. For something straightforward and in period, the Met's classic Dexter production is available. There, I regret only the pallid personality given the title character by the attractive Julia Migenes.",1422489600,19,7213,4.789558232931727
8670233,1,B00M4CA7O6,"The basic premise of LULU is that the name character has, unconsciously, tremendous sexual attraction to men (and in the last act, also to the lesbian Countess Geschwitz), thus the ideal way to portray her is someone who is lively, friendly, and sexually active but not a purposeful tease. Soprano Barbara Hannigan tries very hard to portray Lulu this wayyou can see it in her facial expressions and her basic approach to actingbut is constantly thwarted by the perverted, oversexed production of Krzysztof Warlikowski. In addition to having Lulu appear in various states of undress, even when she is entertaining guests in her living room, he came up with the crackpot idea of making this the adventures of a mad, nymphomaniac dancer who never fulfilled her adolescent dream of becoming a prima ballerina and portraying Odile in Swan Lake.  Because of this, in addition to parading her around half-naked most of the time, he adds fuel to the fire by showing videos of Lulu in various states of undress and sexual excitement on a projection screen at the top left of the stage area, and Hannigan, as Lulu, is required to go through most of the opera on pointe (as if a real ballerina or would-be ballerina would willingly walk around their apartment in the most difficult position of all). This reduces the title character from a human being to a ballet-dancing sex doll with no value as a person, which is at odds with Hannigans conception of the role. (Was Warlikowski erotically aroused by ballerinas as a youth? I also find it interesting that HIS name, not Bergs or Hannigans, is the big selling point of this drink coaster.) If this is your idea of Lulu, then this production is for you. As for me, the only thing I can praise is the musical portion, meaning the singing and conducting, which are first-rate.

I should also add that, for a modern-day DVD, this has a fairly blurred and indistinct visual quality, much like a 1980s VHS tape. For me, then, the production is total crap, the musical values first-rate. Hannigan and most of the cast have superb voices and the conducting is excellent, but I simply couldn't watch this production.",1418601600,18,2148,4.787061994609164
8670234,5,B00M4CA7O6,"Lulu is the kind of work that opens itself up to infinite rearrangement of its elements. The eternal ambiguity that is Lulu, or indeed the eternal ambiguity that is the fate of a woman in the modern world, as well as the unfinished nature of the writing means that even within the two acts that were fully scored by Alban Berg, there is a multiplicity of meaning that can be applied to its themes. For Polish director Krzysztof Warlikowski in his 2012 production for La Monnaie-De Munt in Brussels the principal idea that is emphasised - the one that expresses the inner nature of Lulu before it becomes corrupted by the reality of her circumstances - is that of her childhood ambition to be a successful dancer.

To add further weight to this idea, Warlikowski refers to a little-known biographical detail in Bergs life, an unacknowledged daughter, Albine, who later made contact with Berg looking for a father or a father-figure, but also hoping perhaps to be taken seriously through her association with Berg in her dream of being an artist. For the director, its hard not to consider that the nature of this relationship would have found its way into the composition of Lulu, and its certainly an interesting detail that adds to the mystery and ambiguity of the work. Warlikowski also considers the violin concerto for Lulu that was used as the requiem for the 17 year old daughter of Alma Mahler and architect Walter Gropius, but typically there are a multitude of relevant movie and modern pop culture references, quoting everything from David Lynch to Darren Aronofskys lurid melodrama Black Swan.

It looks terrific, but combined with Berg's ideas, there's almost too much going on to take in really. Effective use is made of screens and projections, with additional dancers and figures presenting a disturbing freak-show display in a glass cage and a final act that is set in a ballet school dormitory (by way of an underground station) that feels frightening and exploitative.  The image of the dancer dominates here, with even an extended dance sequence added to the end of the first act, where a dancer in a black tutu (Rosalba Torres Guerrero), strips down to waist and performs the dance of the dying swan with extraordinary intensity.  Young girls in ballet outfits also populate the stage, often within a glass cage - at least one of whom is presumably meant to represent Lulus innocence - but others reflect explicit references in the work to the sale into prostitution and the exploitation of women. Most directly however, Lulu herself is frequently dressed in tutus and dancer costumes, moves around en pointe, dancing to her doom.

Barbara Hannigan throws herself fearlessly into the role, but theres really no other way to play Lulu. Her high range and light soprano is perfect for the role and evidently she is tested to the limits here, having to dance through some scenes as well. By any standard however, it's an extraordinary performance. An all-round strong cast gives the production further richness. Natascha Petrinsky brings a softer, more vulnerable but strong sensibility to the usually difficult to characterise Countess Geschwitz; Charles Workman is a handsomely voiced and driven Alwa; and Dietrich Henschel is suitably and impressively menacing as Dr. Schn and Jack The Ripper. Lulu is always a difficult work to grasp entirely, and this lavish production filled with ideas and resonances could just add to the confusion, but it at least tries to capture the whole range of possibilities and tones within the work.  It's decadent where it ought to be, wild and abandoned, but also serious, precise and intense on the points that matter.",1415232000,18,3672,4.952922077922078
