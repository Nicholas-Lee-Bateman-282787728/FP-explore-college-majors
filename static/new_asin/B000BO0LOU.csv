2431565,2,B000BO0LOU,"this movie is probaly one of the weakest films in the last five years. the acting is so cheezy and stupid i almost walked out in the middle of the film. the sound was good but the story, acting, quality, entertainment was wack. only those stupid rednecks who are winning motorcross nationals or sections or whatever they do are going to like this movie. o and i forgot the picture is horrible. if you needed anything to make a movie about motorcross you need good picture. i would even admit it would be kinda cool if a motorcycle flew past me. so u have to have good picture so it would look like that. the picure was terrible. worst picure ive seen in i don't know how many years.

BUT of all the negatives there is a positive.

KIDS WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE. this is the miami reviewer. PEACE.",1125360000,3,792,4.308724832214765
2431566,4,B000BO0LOU,"While it's not an earthshattering film, ""Supercross"" does keep you glued to the screen with excellent motorcycle action sequences and some sweet romance.  Directed by Steve Boyum who directed ""Meet the Deedles,"" the plot is your basic underdog who wins the race & gets the girl.  Steve Howey from ""Reba"" TV series plays KC Carlyle who is a fairly cautious but talented racer.  He impresses the team of a Japanese motorcycle company who take him on.  Unfortunately, the head of this played by Robert Patrick only wants KC to be the wingman so his son Rowdy can win the races.  When KC pulls ahead and wins a race, he upstages Rowdy and quits the lavishly sponsored team.  Trip Carlyle played by Mike Vogel from ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" & ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" may be more talented, but he also takes more chances and lacks the maturity to control himself.  In their audition for the sponsored team, he gets into a fist fight with Rowdy, leading to his brother KC being chosen for the big job and relegating Trip to continue his day job cleaning pools.  Sophia Bush from TV's ""One Tree Hill"" plays Zoe, the wealthy law student whose pool KC cleans.  She comes to be his steady girl and helps him from time to time like a manager.  Cameron Richardson from ""The Good Humor Man"" plays Piper Cole and becomes attracted to Trip.  The romance between Piper & Trip is one of the high points as Trip who is so bold on a bike is a bit slow on the pickup with the ladies.  The two seem to connect very sweetly & sincerely on film showing great chemistry.  Daryl Hannah was listed as playing the mother in the promo credits, but I didn't recall her being in the movie!  The film concludes with KC, now a privateer rather than a sponsored rider, overcoming several obstacles including a biker named Evans who is out to get him to win the crown.  While not being classic cinema by any means, ""Supercross"" is an entertaining night at the theatre that has you rooting for the good guys.  You can almost feel the earth move under their bikes.  Enjoy!",1124841600,16,2047,4.5340599455040875

2431584,1,B000BO0LOU,"this movie is a total belly flop from 40 feet.  The exceptionally beautiful and talented Sophia Bush should not have agreed to this movie as it was a complete waste of her talent.  The two main actors are just like another reviewer stated, cardboard characters.  The 2nd brother Trip is such a colossal loser and failure that you wish the writers would edit him out of the script.  The trailer for this movie is 10 times better than the movie.  Aside from the pathetic acting, the cheesy story line, and the despicable characters, this movie was so boring it completely failed to hold my attention for even10 seconds.

2431606,2,B000BO0LOU,"The closest cousin to this film in the family of cinema has to be ""You Got Served."" Both films place cardboard cutout characters on screen to provide backdrop to a commercial for a niche hobby. The thing that is wrong with this strategy is that everybody involved in these hobbies would probably be offended by the lameness of the movie itself. You just couldn't look at it and be like, ""Yeah, that just totally represented what I am all about."" Anybody who watches this will recognize it as the utter crap that it is. The only thing that it does right is keep the images flashing in front of your eyeballs fast enough that you don't nod off. That means that I didn't suffer through this the way I would a truly sleep inducing stinker such as ""Laura's Star."" But just because your eyeballs won't fall asleep doesn't mean that your mind won't because everything about this production is brain dead. The biggest offended is almost certainly the script. Line after line had me pondering just how the script got approval from 20th Century Fox as it truly sounds like it was written by a 3rd grader trying to impress me with his toughness.

We are treated to a tale of two brothers who like to race their bikes. One is studious and sells out as fast as he can, while the other is a slacker thus providing boring and obvious conflict. Once K.C (Steve Howey) sells out he starts in on lecturing his brother on how he needs to grow up and other things of that nature. The implication is clear, he is desired by corporations for his maturity and everybody should fall in line like him. That mindset only lasts so long as his new corporate buddies have only one plan in mind for him and that is wingman to their star Rowdy (Channing Tatum). You know where the story goes from here as we get a lesson on how you should never play second fiddle, which is fine but a little contradictory considering that the film is little more than a wingman for Mountain Dew, Honda, and Papa John's. If you listen closely you can even hear them slip in an ad for Las Vegas (""What happens in Vegas..."") that undoubtedly didn't come free.

The whole point is to set up a race (on the biggest stage of them all!) between K.C and his former lord and master. But I didn't care at all. I did spend some time wondering about the racing footage itself as for all I know it was just stock footage considering that it served no purpose plot wise. I was also amused by the perplexing casting decision to pair grizzled, nail spitting Robert Patrick with useless pretty boy Aaron Carter as father and son. In the opening credits Clear Channel showed up, something I had never seen before. Since they are now notorious for backing the wrong war it should come as no surprise that they now backed the wrong movie. Paid for by knuckleheads, made by knuckleheads, for knuckleheads. Watch at your own risk and don't expect anything interesting or in the least bit thought provoking. **",1169251200,,2940,4.483208955223881
2431607,2,B000BO0LOU,"I'll make my review short not to spend too many words on writing about what you have already known. I only say two things; `Supercross' is about the world of Supercross competition, and very short (80 mins). If I may add one more thing, you don't find anything else in the film.

`Supercross' stars two young actors Steve Howey and Mike Vogel as two brothers who race motorcycle, but as you know, the film is made primarily for the purpose of showing the Supercross action scenes. So if the film is virtually full of clich&eacute;d items such as brotherly jealousy, father-like mentor, or big competition that concludes the film, it is perfectly OK with me. I actually do not care if one character gets badly injured during a race and is confined to bed, and the same person shows up again, only several days after the terrible accident, walking and even hopping on crutches as if it's only an ankle sprain.

What really matters is the race scenes, which need more improvement. Don't get me wrong here because I am not talking about the races or the stunts themselves. Stunt-turned-director Steve Boyum shows a lot of shots of the Supercross bikes flying in the air, but he shows alarmingly little concern as to how to present them to us viewers. The camera overuses the same angles and the same techniques (like slow motion and fast-forwarding) over and over again. The shots of the dirt race course and the audiences (both real ones, I think) themselves are shot fine enough to convey the feeling of watching the real race, but as the director shows little skills in narrative, we have to listen carefully to the announcer's voice to know who is who, or who is winning.

Those things deprive the film's actions of the dramatic tension of the race scenes. Watching a flying bike may be a really exciting experience, but you need more than that to make the race truly thrilling and exciting. After all you can watch the real ones at the Supercross competition, so why make a movie?",1162166400,3,1981,4.654285714285714
2431608,4,B000BO0LOU,I am buying this movie after watching it on vacation.  You laugh it at at first ... then its one of those movies that once you start watching it -- you cant turn it off!

2431609,4,B000BO0LOU,"This movie surprised me.  I was expecting another straight to DVD, sport/racing film, with no plot and bad acting.  What I got was an entertaining fast paced film, with above average acting, and a decent writing.  The only problem with the film was that it was too short, lack of character development, and left out relationship issues left you wondering.  I think lack of budget lead to plot holes, but the film still managed to pull through, and cross the finish line.  The race scenes were shot at various Southern California locations, and felt like real events, they must have shot on location of some real events, cause it did capture the feel of the track.  Worth the low cost, this film can be re watched, again and again.",1151884800,2,730,4.62015503875969

2431614,5,B000BO0LOU,"""Supercross"" photography gets the motor running better with each next event. Action is crisp and clear under the stadium lights at the Las Vegas THQ Championship.

An easy-does-it ""Southern Cal"" lifestyle blends (or not) with the hard knocks of the Supercross circuit. Living takes a backseat all the way to the Vegas racing reveille.

Tyler Evans, David Pingree and David Castillo show natural acting talent. Castillo, Joe Bucaro III and other stunt riders take some chances on their bikes.

Along with this ""Supercross"" Directors Cut there are several added Specials. One Feature on the DVD shows interviews with the stunt riders and another gives how the stunts are performed. Most ""Supercross"" cycling is filmed during gate competition.

Director Steve Boyum has made stunts in over sixty movies. Special camera equipment accelerates over lots of yardage with zoom, so this Dolby 5.1 DVD will ""bring it"" to you here and now with the summersault and lightning sporting theater action of ""Supercross.""",1132531200,6,1003,5.25
2431615,4,B000BO0LOU,"There has been a reel misunderstanding here.

""Supercross, The Movie"" was never intended to compete with ""Gone With The Wind.""

The magic of this Action Sport dramatic is the tremendous racing footage at the Las Vegas Chanpionship, the combination of docu-drama (Tyler Evans, and other racers show acting talent) and the nostalgic simple romantic twine of certain plot development that has nothing to do with life today. This romantic magic is from a better time.

The use of impressionism and split screen during parts of the film was well done. There was some poorly photgraphed scenes in the beginning of the movie.

The sound was good. I enjoyed the music soundtrack. The digital audio effects during the races, made ""Supercross, The Movie"" more extreme than simple realism.

The movie needed to be expanded. It seemed incomplete. I think ""Supercross, The Movie"" will be better understood and appreciated as time goes on. This film tries some things in a way that is seldom done today. That's a good thing.",1126051200,6,1010,4.988095238095238

Yes the film was a little short, the plot simple, and a few technical details might not have been perfect, but Supercross did convey the dynamics of Supercross Racing and how competitors must race with total aggressiveness to survive ! I can't recall any type of sports film that had actual competition scenes included, no way a ""staged"" race could come close to the ""real deal"" of an actual Supercross event. The main characters grow on you (several needed more screen time) but the dialogue seemed close to kids today (I have a twenty something) and the acting/action seemed realistic (people do wear short shorts and remove shirts in hot climes), I'll bet the race site scenes are darn accurate and representive of today's kids. The outcome could only have two scenarios: win or lose, and don't most of us root for the underdog anyway !! All the critics nitpicking aside (none of which affected my enjoyment of the movie), Supercross is a pure entertainment, family action sports movie with intense racing.

I wouldn't watch it again anytime soon but I could see myself watching it again in another couple years. The story has been done a million times before but this time the story is set in the world of motorcross. It has enough going for it that it should keep you entertained for 1 hour & 20 minutes & if you're not entertained, the little 1's will most definitely be, if you have little 1's. I don't understand why it got so much hate. It's not going to win any awards but in my opinion, it was a pretty decent movie. To each their own, you like what you like & hate what you hate.
