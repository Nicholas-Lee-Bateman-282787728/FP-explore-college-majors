The original 1993 Les Visiteurs is one of my favorite movies of all times. The sequel was bad, this one is as bad as the sequel. I just love Clavier and Reno, yet this is such a weak movie.",1505088000,,221,3.8043478260869565
8763023,5,B01GIZDBHE,"I really loved this one. It's really different than the first and sequel, that's why I like it. Christian Clavier is amazing as always, Jean Reno is tired but still great.",1490140800,,171,4.548387096774194
8763024,1,B01GIZDBHE,HORRIBLE!  Do NOT buy this movie.  It's not funny like the previous ones.,1479513600,,73,4.538461538461538
