8452081,4,B0050Z3UNY,"While there were a few spots in this movie ""The Fleet's In"" that I found kind of boring (mostly some of the musical numbers) overall I did enjoy it.  William Holden was adorable in his part and while it didn't tax his abilities he was fine as always and early Dorothy Lamour was fun to watch.  Eddie Brackin and Betty Hutton provided good comic relief.  It's great to be able to find these early classic films available at Amazon.",1381881600,,430,4.417721518987341
8452082,3,B0050Z3UNY,"The Fleet's In is a movie I saw on TV about 15 years ago.  There were parts of it that were very funny and I have been hoping to find it on DVD.  No luck for years, but then I found it on Amazon.  It is like a DVD that I would burn at home.  I don't know the source material that was used to record it.  Pretty fuzzy, but better than nothing.  It is the movie I was looking for but wish the quality had been better.",1368057600,,415,3.659090909090909
8452083,4,B0050Z3UNY,"I wanted this movie for the music; a pair of classics: Tangerine and I Remember you. The plot is light weight, but the music is great.",1367452800,,134,4.1923076923076925
