3035424,5,B000YV1KZ4,"I really enjoy this DVD; it is very well done.  Dr. Douillard simply and clearly explains principles of Ayurveda on the DVD and the 36-page guide included with it is a helpful reference.  The seasonal grocery lists are great, and the action plan at the end, including skin brushing, self-massage, breathing exercises and yoga practice are now an important part of my morning.  I did the 4-day cleanse this autumn to manage my allergies with success; I feel light and clear.  I think anyone would benefit from this information and technique to maintain and/or improve health.",1257984000,17,574,4.947916666666667

8234119,2,B000YV1KZ4,"This video fails miserably.  It's mostly a rehash of Ayurveda for Weight Loss.  After research sipping warm/hot water  for hydration, is no different than drinking cool or chilled water.  The author should stick with the seasons mentioned and drink cool water in hotter months along with eating cooling fruits and veggies ; so as to keep body temperature normal and warmer water in colder winter months...",1407888000,,405,5.090909090909091
8234120,3,B000YV1KZ4,"Arrived on time, in what appeared to be store wrapped package. Yoga section skipped, stopped and went to main menu. Upon examination I found a small scratch on DVD. I had some DVD fix so...  Just not too happy having to *repair* a *new* item out of the box...u know?  The info contained on the DVD is great. And no, I didn't contact seller about scratch I was going to, but the DVD fix worked so...  All in all its good, may purchase from this seller again if they have what i'm looking for.",1397001600,,491,4.202127659574468
8234121,5,B000YV1KZ4,This is a wonderful CD.  I like the fact that it has chapters so that what you want is easy to find and there is no fast forwarding.  The yoga for everyday is easy and perfect.  I like the whole CD very much,1393286400,2,207,3.7674418604651163
8234122,4,B000YV1KZ4,"This is a very basic introduction to Ayurveda.  It clearly explains the basic principles, but left me wanting many more details.
Really like the daily 15 detox yoga workout... makes it well worth purchasing this.",1361404800,5,212,5.057142857142857
8234123,1,B000YV1KZ4,I have seen a lot of DVD on detox etc... this one is not worth the money. I will be selling it back to amazon. Not enough details. He only skims the surface - should go into a lot more details but he does not. There are only short little segments on each part. I would not buy another DVD of his.,1328227200,2,296,3.7903225806451615
8234124,5,B000YV1KZ4,"The DVD is complete, simple and very helpful for ideas about well being on a mental, spiritual and physical levels.  I liked it so much that I plan to give friends copies of the DVD as an empowering gift for well-being.

The Book 3 IN 1 by the same author was and is also excellent (I am still reading it).  It simplifies ones life and it makes sense about how to eat in harmoney and circumvent or solve those problems with craving.

I love both and recommend them highly.
