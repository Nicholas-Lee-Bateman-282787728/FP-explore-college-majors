8300351,5,B001F0TT7Y,"This was our first Shaun the Sheep video after buying the magazines in a comic store.  AWESOME, is the only way to describe it.  The entire family loves it, adults & kids.  We all just sit around and giggle (and groan)",1253318400,,218,4.2682926829268295
8300352,4,B001F0TT7Y,"Shaun the Sheep is (I think) an offshoot of Wallace and Gromit, so if you're familiar with that you know this is high quality claymation.  There is no dialogue.  Everything is conveyed with facial expressions and body language.  Shaun and his pals are very funny.  Each episode is short -- perhaps ten minutes.

The DVD has some extras that don't seem to be available through a menu.  You have to just let the disc auto-play, and after all the episodes have played there is a segment with kids talking about Shaun the Sheep.

Too bad there aren't more discs available.",1236729600,,568,4.62
8300353,5,B001F0TT7Y,"Of course, I love Wallace & Grommit, and Shaun is nearly as clever.  Wallace & Grommit are a little above my 4 year old granddaughter's sense of humor, but oh my, she LOVES Shaun.  That clever, clever Nick Parks.",1235779200,,212,4.410256410256411
8300354,5,B001F0TT7Y,"We first saw Shaun the Sheep on Disney and our son (one year old at the time) loved it so much we bought the DVD set from Amazon UK and a Region Free DVD player just so he could watch it.  He's almost 2 1/2 now and still loves it.  He recently started watching Wallace and Gromit and loves the trio of shows and the were-rabbit movie, too!",1234483200,,339,3.9705882352941178
8300355,5,B001F0TT7Y,"Plays on US DVD players! My kids have been waiting for a US DVD version for years. Santa brought it for Christmas, and they love it. Definitely great for American Shaun the Sheep fans!",1230422400,3,184,4.4411764705882355
8300356,5,B001F0TT7Y,"Shaun and his flock had us laughing so hard we had tears in our eyes.  My children are almost teenagers and loved it.  I am ordering more copies to give to my Mom and Dad and grown sister and her husband.  If you are looking for lighthearted fun, hit 'play' for Shaun the Sheep.",1230249600,,278,4.111111111111111
8300357,5,B001F0TT7Y,"I am soooooooo happy that this is now in the states, anyone who watches this will fall in love with Shaun! Great for all ages, from my 2 year old to my husband and my parents! It's a hit!",1228003200,5,187,3.8205128205128207
8300358,5,B001F0TT7Y,"If ""Chicken Run"" was ""The Great Escape"", then Shaun the Sheep is ""Hogan's Heroes.""  Sean is Col. Hogan, the dog is Schultz... and the farmer is Col. Klink.  Completely charming.",1226707200,7,177,4.866666666666666
