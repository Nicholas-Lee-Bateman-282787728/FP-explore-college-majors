It is so great to see a dedication to Nils and his music, and the Grin reunion is amazing.  If you are a Nils fan, get this!",1426464000,,266,3.5517241379310347
8471067,5,B005G3QV86,"Review of A Tribute To Nils Lofgren - Special Grin Reunion

I bought this off Nils' website a couple of years ago and man, am I glad I did - it is without a doubt one of the coolest DVDs ever and one of my absolute best purchases, truly a treasured item - and I don't use that word lightly....usually the word ""treasured"" sounds sappy to me, but in this context it is entirely appropriate - and accurate.

This was arranged as a tribute to/for Nils, with many musicians he has played with over the years taking part. Even though the big names like Bruce and Neil aren't there, thank God for that as it would have ruined the special feeling of community that pervades the event. Not only was it held on Nils' old stomping grounds near DC, but Tommy Lofgren I believe was the catalyst/event coordinator/musical director/MC/musician Jack-Of-All-Trades, and he did a fantastic job of pulling a truly incredible array of talent together to pay their respects and show their love for Nils Lofgren. Some of the names are (and yes, I did cut and paste these from the product description in the interest of getting this done): The Lofgren Bros., Bob Berberich, Tommy Keene, Jeff ""Skunk"" Baxter, Mary Ann Redmond, Tommy Lepson, Martha Hull, Eric Brace, Rocky Roberts, Mike Zack, Tom Miller, Julie Sanderson, Timm Biery, Wade Matthews, Buck Brown, Chuck Sullivan, Eric ""Roscoe"" Ambel, Billy Gordon, Louie Newmyer, Ronnie Newmyer, Bobby Manriquez, many of whom have played with Nils, and some, I think, who may not have but just wanted to pay their respects and were honored to be asked to do so.

Apparently Eric Ambel, of Del Lords fame and producer of many great records, including Crooked Line by Nils - his last great CD in my humble opinion - flew down from NYC just for this event and rips it up, as does Tommy Keene, a DC native and power-pop icon. Not only do you get to see these guys cut loose and just have a blast, but to my knowledge (and I could be  wrong, I am quite often) there is little or no footage of these guys in action, as is the case with many of the other acts here - many of whom I was unfamiliar with prior to viewing this DVD, but all of whom impressed me (especially Eric Brace, to name one off the top of my head), and some who, frankly, blew me away, Bobby Manriquez coming to mind first and foremost.

So this is not only a tribute to Nils Lofgren but on a larger scale a showcase of the length and breadth of the musical talent that has its seeds in the DC music scene, which then grew and cross-pollinated across the diaspora of the rest of the USA, if you keep in mind that Nils has gone from recording with Neil Young and Crazy Horse in Cali and later, New Jersey and NYC with Bruce and recording with ""Roscoe"" Ambel in Brooklyn, NYC. It is truly remarkable how many people he has touched not only by playing his and others' music for literally millions of fans but also how many great musicians are on this DVD who may not be household names, may not have ""made it"", to use industry slang, but are no less talented than many of the biggest names that HAVE ""made it."" Sometimes it just comes down to timing and luck. Gratifyingly for Nils and his fans he has had a sufficient measure of both, as well as an abundance of talent. Along with these great unrehearsed, heartfelt and spirited performances are excellent interviews with most of the participants, which really allows the viewer to place them within the context of Nils' long, distinguished career. It is absolutely fascinating to listen to these people recount their connections to Nils, musically and personally. It really gives you a completely different perspective of him not only as a musician, but, more importantly, as a person. And because this was not ""professionally"" done - and I mean that in a GOOD way - their sincerity shines through. They did this because they wanted to, not because they were gonna get paid or gain a higher profile through greater industry and commercial exposure.

The highlight of this, though - for me, at least - is what can only be described as a GRIN REUNION!!!

Unlike many of these things, where the honored guest is not present due to prior engagements, embarrassment, disinterest, snobbery, etc., Nils IS present. But he doesn't make his presence known until late in the proceedings, when he does a short set of a few of his best known solo, i.e. later in his career, tunes, like Black Book, Valentine, Share A Little, etc, with a rotating cast of interchangeable fellow musicians, quite a few of whom are previous band members, like Tommy, Mike Zack (GREAT drummer), Buck Brown, Timm Biery, etc. Each one brings something unique to the table and you can see why Nils would have been attracted to playing with them in the first place. You can check out the setlist above. But then - he calls out Bob Berberich, Grin's drummer and a FANTASTIC singer, he still has THAT voice - and Billy Gordon, original Grin bassist (sadly deceased) Bob Gordon's son, to play bass (Tommy was already on stage from playing in Nils' earlier solo set). An ""Official"" (or as ""official"" as it possibly could be) GRIN REUNION! And they then proceed to JUST TEAR IT UP. Tunes played are Shine silently, Love or else (sung by Nils and Berberich), If a were a song (sung by Nils and Berberich), See what a love can do, Slippery fingers, Like rain, 18 faced lover (sung by Nils and Berberich), Moon tears, We all sung together (literally! and I came to dance.......WOW. Just wow....NEVER in a million years did I think I would EVER see something like this. Truly a very emotional experience if you are even a casual Nils Lofgren fan. Many of these tunes I believe Nils hasn't played since Grin broke up and he may never play them again. So what you are watching is Rock History literally being made before your eyes. THANK GOD someone (can't remember the name(s) of the producer and/or director off the top of my head, sorry) had the foresight to film this truly momentous event. If there were any justice in the world this would be widely distributed and easy to obtain - but I'm sure if you do a little detective work, you'll be able to obtain a copy LEGALLY, without sacrificing an arm and a leg.

Throughout Nils conducts himself with nothing but dignity, class, professionalism and humility, as well as clear affection and respect for his fellow musicians and friends honoring him. He has to be one of the classiest people in the Rock Biz, which no doubt has facilitated his sterling reputation and long career as a first call guitarist/band member by the likes of the aforementioned Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen and Ringo, to name just a few. And what a few....name ONE other musician who can make the same claim. I can't.

And a big reason for his success and high regard by other musical peers is that, in the words of another DC favorite, Little Feat's Lowell George, he treated the same people the same way on the way up - which is why there's been no corresponding fall. And I doubt there ever will be. He is loved. By MANY.

If you have read this far, you KNOW how special and cool this is. And if there is ANY way to get your hands on this, DO IT! You will NOT be disappointed and I GUARANTEE it will become one of your most treasured musical possessions.

Thanks for indulging me.",1365120000,3,7297,4.533029612756264
