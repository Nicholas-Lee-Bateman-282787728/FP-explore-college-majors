2590800,2,B000FUTV1O,"Aunt Rose (James Tucker, 2005)

Yet another no-budget horror movie with some great ideas, but not enough execution to carry them off. In this one, we follow the parallel stories of a trio of malcontents, Johnny (Joshua Nelson, also responsible for the script), Stewie (voice actor Kevin T. Collins), and Robin (Vulgaras lead vocalist Velocity Chayaldd) and an all-American dysfunctional family until the two collide in a home invasion. The thing is that said dysfunctional family are not exactly what you'd call entirely normal, and the invaders get more than they bargained for.

The ugliest thing about this movie is by far the acting, which ranges from passably decent (Nelson and Elizabeth Cooke, who plays the daughter in the family) to downright horrible (a minor character in the opening scene, and Aunt Rose [Marty Gargle] herself). The inconsistency in delivery makes what seems as if it must have been an interesting script less than it could have been. The special effects are uniformly horrid (once again, that opening scene sets the tone for the movie, though the movie does get a great deal better than that in most respects); one particular scene involving an opened throat is perhaps the silliest use of rubber prosthetics I've seen since Stuart Gordon's hilarious take on Dagon. There's not much else to speak of in the way of technology; Tucker uses a pretty small collection of sets here, so the cinematography work never has much of a chance to rise above the level of competent (and it is always competent), the lighting is well above average for this level of production, the editing is decent, etc.

So in the end, a number of flaws undermine what is otherwise a fun movie. I can't recommend it without hesitation, but if you're not the kind of person to consider the marks against listed above as showstoppers, you'll probably get a kick out of this. Oh, and one other thing: if you're not fond of porcelain dolls, skip the opening title sequence (they never show up again). **",1182729600,4,2001,4.86217008797654

2590802,1,B000FUTV1O,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. A whole lot of talk and very little action. I love cheesy horor films, but this absolutely sucked.

Joshua Nelson is hot, but there are no scenes with him so much as shirtless, so there is no point whatsoever to seeing this film. And what kind of name is Velocity Chyaldd? Jeez...",1160870400,6,322,4.278688524590164
2590803,5,B000FUTV1O,"I actually thought that the acting in this movie was excellent all around for ANY film (with the exception of a rocker in the opening scene)....but ESPECIALLY for a low budget horror film!!!  Joshua Nelson and Kevin T. Collins are exceptional in their roles, as is Elizabeth Cooke in hers. I read online yesterday that a lot of the effects had to be edited out to make an ""R"" rating because of ""sadistic violence""???, but even with that there were still scenes that made me cringe!!! I've been waiting to see this since I read about it in ""Fangoria"" and I was pleasantly surprised.  Definitely recommended!!!",1158192000,13,608,4.726415094339623

ANYWAY -

AUNT ROSE, I had the pleasure of viewing last October as an official selection to the NYC Horror Film Festival. This disturbing piece of suburban Grand Guignol has it all; Home invasion in the style of Last House On The Left, excellent special FX, fantastic acting, moody setting and the perfect nemesis for our 3 horrible intruders - Aunt Rose - a sickly old harridan just aching for some fresh new visitors! Written by and starring the very talented Joshua Nelson and directed by the equally gifted James Tucker - Aunt Rose pulls no punches and gets down and dirty right away. A great additon to Anchor Bay's growing catalogue of fantastic horror! Buy it today!",1158019200,15,784,4.7153284671532845

8126968,2,B000FUTV1O,I thought about buying this on Amazon. When they marked it down under $10 I decided to buy it. Glad I waited. It was a really silly movie. Don't waste your money!,1407542400,,162,4.09375
8126969,1,B000FUTV1O,These people crack me up trying to sell a lame movie like this for $120.00. I wouldn't pay 2 cents for this trash. DREAM ON,1357689600,,123,3.96
8126970,3,B000FUTV1O,it came but slow this seams to be  a bit of a problem the other reviews also say this. for this reason i  give them a three star it was well packaged,1291852800,,149,3.625
8126971,1,B000FUTV1O,"You know how you sometimes buy a movie because you think the cover looks promising, well that's the mistake I made with this bit of low budget trash, now don't you go making the same error.
Aunt Rose is garbage, nice cover though.",1282176000,,230,4.372093023255814
8126972,1,B000FUTV1O,"""Do not buy this movie, I repeat, do not buy this movie."" This is suppose to be a low budget horror, about three killers who like to cause chaos against whoever they come across. They come across a family, that has a sick relative with the power, to bring back the dead to seek revenge on those who hurt her family. The acting is really horrible, and it's really amateur. It's such a waste of money. I was psyched by the cover, and the little story about the movie, but it's not what it seems, save your money.",1280102400,4,510,4.214285714285714
8126973,3,B000FUTV1O,"There are just some movies I won't/can't finish five minutes into it. I finished this one, though. I just had to see what was up with Aunt Rose. Not the best acting, definitely had some blood in it. It was more humorous than anything else, which made it worth watching. The lead female tried really hard and did manage to gross me out. If you can get through the first 10 minutes, then you might as well keep watching cuz it isn't all that bad, but I do wish I wouldn't have bought it.",1259539200,3,485,4.170212765957447

but still it was okay. I wasn't dissappointed!!",1256515200,2,102,4.421052631578948
8126975,4,B000FUTV1O,"""Aunt Rose"" is quite a character that reminds me of a witch, she is actually the best actor in the whole movie. I found it entertaining but the actors leave a lot to be desired. It would have been boring but the 3 thugs (which includes a heavy blonde with large breasts) kept me amused. It wasn't the best of my video collection but it's certainly not the worst by a long shot.",1253836800,,377,4.178082191780822
8126976,4,B000FUTV1O,"A family dinner is interrupted by three murderous criminals on the run. Said felons barge in, take the family hostage, and spend the evening terrifying and tormenting them. Eventually, innocent people are killed. What these home-invaders don't know is that the bed-bound, invalid auntie upstairs is in reality a very dangerous person indeed. She has mystical powers that prove fatal to the marauding trio. AUNT ROSE is a solid example of ultra-low budget film-making done right. The family is believable, the thugs are reprehensible, and the story is simple, but engaging. To me, the standout is singer / performance artiste, Velocity Chyaldd. She plays the wicked Robin w/ a sensual fervor that brought a smile. The rest of the cast was good as well, especially the menacing Joshua Nelson, Elizabeth Cooke, and the surprising Rayne Brown. So, if you're up for a night of cheap cinamatic thrills, AUNT ROSE should get you through...",1226620800,6,932,5.098039215686274
