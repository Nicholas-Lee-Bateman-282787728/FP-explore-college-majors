7814658,5,6301696670,"I looked forward this films for years. It is very interesting  and alouds us to see a good piece of war propaganda. That is not a negative aspect. On the contrary it is its big quality. Good story, good perfomances and think about  it - Randolph Scott is a doctor and not a cowboy!",1475884800,2,281,4.185185185185185

There are 3 scenes that live in my memory and 2 of them are with Anthony Quinn. I thought it was really good, lots of drama, war, love, jealousy, excitement and Chen-Ta.",1470268800,,284,3.75

7814662,2,6301696670,"The movie itself is an OK Randolph Scott vehicle that has him as a doctor in China during WWII who helps the Chinese fight the invading Japanese army while dealing with his new bride having difficulties adjusting to China and his associate doctor (Ruth Warrick) who also loves him.

The DVD itself is a dub with a considerable background hiss on the soundtrack. The picture quality is soft/slightly fuzzy and barely watchable (not as bad as some of the Alpha DVDs, but no where near DVD quality).",1429056000,,496,4.7011494252873565
7814663,5,6301696670,"One of my favorite WW2 films with the Pearl S(The Good Earth)Buck touch.
Randolph Scott is an American doctor working in a Chinese town being constantly bombed by the Japanese. Ruth(Citzen Kane)Warrick is his second in command. Ruth loves MR Scott,but he considers her his partner and friend.
Randolph returns from The States with money to help the hospital and also with Ellen Drew his wife.
Chinese underground leader Anthony Quinn brings in a wounded POW,Richard(The Purple Heart,First Yank Into Tokyo)Loo,a cruel murderer of civilians. Anthony wants him put on trial for his many murders.
Ellen,a spoiled society girl grows tired of China and soon has suspicions of Ruth,who she falesly thinks is having an affair with Randolph,.She soon has a plan of having to return to the States with MR Loo being smuggled on the plane.
I liked this film very much. Im a big Pearl S Buck fan.",1324684800,,883,4.8933333333333335
7814664,3,6301696670,"China sky is the romantic tale of two American doctors in war torn China and two love triangles- one between the American doctors and his American wife, and the second between a Chinese Nurse, her Korean fiance and a Chinese freedom fighter. Both love triangles were predictable and unequal from the beginning which leads to an overall unsatisfying and `easy' story as one partner was villainized throughout this film.

 The action starts when clueless Dr. Gray returns from America with a vain young wife. The young wife has difficulty adjusting to the nearly daily air raids and becomes jealous of the female doctor who she suspects (rightly) is in love with her husband. Meanwhile, a young Chinese nurse has been engaged to Dr. Kim against her will, while she loves a freedom fighter. Over the course of the film, Dr. Gray realizes his love for the other American doctor, and his young wife's jealous plotting betrays the entire town.

I enjoyed elements of China sky, however the love triangles was weak and unsatisfying.  It isn't enjoyable triangle if someone is clearly unsuitable from the get go. The convenient `deaths' of unsuitable partners made it easy for the romantic leads to hook up, however making the `third wheels' villainous cheapened the impact of what otherwise might've been a moving film.",1277683200,,1312,4.9771689497716896
