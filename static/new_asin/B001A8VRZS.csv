8276411,5,B001A8VRZS,This was a good bye to see and hear of all he and Yoko had gone through all those years ago. I am glad I was able to find this on Amazon.,1378080000,,137,3.3125
8276412,1,B001A8VRZS,"I AGREE TOTALLY WITH TYRONE REX. I DON'T MIND A LITTLE COMMENTARY, BUT THIS WAS VERY ANNOYING. I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HALF OF WHAT THEY WERE COMMENTING ABOUT, AND WHAT YOU COULD UNDERSTAND WAS MOSTLY WORTHLESS BULL THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW.
YOU GET A TASTE OF THE MUSIC, ONLY TO GET INTERUPTED EVERY 20 SECONDS BY SOME MARBLE MOUTH BORE.I WISH I READ TYRONES' REVIEW BEFORE BUYING THIS TEASE !
I ONLY GIVE IT 1/2 STAR.",1248998400,10,414,4.533333333333333
8276413,3,B001A8VRZS,"I have some interest in songwriters, so I found this DVD interesting on how the songs of John Lennon matured during the years he was in the Beatles, making a few movies, and exposed to Bob Dylan and drugs. Heroin makes a good explanation for the break up of the Beatles, as John Lennon became reluctant to take part in anything that did not get him off in a major high. Something about John Lennon being shot still tells me more than this DVD was willing to try for. Tom Paxton wrote a song, ""Crazy John"" as if ""Where you gonna run to today?"" and ""I want to be crazy, too"" were more natural reactions than a lifetime studying popular music.",1248134400,,640,4.297520661157025
8276414,3,B001A8VRZS,"I purchased this video in hopes of seeing classic live performances by John winston ono Lennon. I had hoped to see them uninteruped. However every clip that was shown, was interupted by various coherts from the past who infringed upon the so called performaces with their opinions. I feel the poterntial purchaser should know what is in store for him, should  he/she elect to buy this DVD. I wish I could gather together video performaces from John's all too short career in music. As is, what you get is a lot recollectins, yet not enough live performaces.",1235433600,32,557,4.742268041237113
