6259439,5,B00ID9PZD2,In the beginning we didn't know what we had gotten into. I almost turned it off. It is definitely not one of those predictable Christmas stories! But it was amazing.,1418515200,18,165,4.533333333333333
6259440,5,B00ID9PZD2,"One of those good ""under the radar"" films. Definitely worth the $2.99 rental. Uplifting, but not sugar coated. Stay with it to the end.",1418428800,8,135,4.666666666666667

6259444,5,B00ID9PZD2,"Lost Christmas is a story with big heart.  It is a magical, ethereal, modern day tale of morality which engages, delights and inspires.
As the plot unfolds there is something for everyone, and with a sterling British cast is deliverers throughout, which makes it the perfect blend for family viewing.

Highly recommended.",1416096000,12,321,5.153846153846154

6259457,5,B00ID9PZD2,"A pleasant surprise that went well beyond my expectations. If you're like me you probably enjoy the Christmas classics but you also get tired of sitting through the same movies with family and friends year-after-year over-and-over. That said, it can be difficult to find christmas themed films that are less known but worth watching. Most are terribly-cheesy, low budget unoriginal love stories or so childish it makes anyone beyond the age of 12 cringe. In my mind, Lost Christmas does enough to escape the pitfalls mentioned above and has a very different look and feel than most christmas films.  It grabs you early and draws you closer as the story unfolds into a warm holiday message. Surprisingly this film has been out since 2014. Hopefully you enjoy it as much as I did :)",1513209600,2,780,4.82089552238806

6259463,5,B00ID9PZD2,"If you are used to the usual, predictable common girl meets her prince story that is recycled every year and passed off as a Christmas story, it's time to break out of the rot and experience a Christmas movie that raises the bar to heights of excellence.

6259491,4,B00ID9PZD2,"It was a good movie and entertainment. The way the plot develops is a little involved and complicated but it all comes together in the end.

It is not your common Christmas movie. It has more of a sad drama tone than the classics but the message overall is definitely something that can be linked to Christmas.

While the ending may be a little expected, the journey there keeps you engaged in the movie and makes you connect with it.

If you are looking for a break from the classics, this would be a good B movie to watch.",1483488000,,524,4.2727272727272725

6259509,1,B00ID9PZD2,Not a Christmas movie. The cover is misrepresenting. It is a weird movie that involves occult activity and Hinduism. Very strange. Has nothing to do with Christmas a little boy and his dog.,1483315200,,189,4.757575757575758
6259510,5,B00ID9PZD2,BEAUTIFUL MOVIE,1483315200,,15,7.0
6259511,5,B00ID9PZD2,"A beautiful and poignant story of a young boy who loses his family on Christmas Eve. The story takes places one year later and shows the hardships that he has had to endure. It also shows how each live we touch is interconnected in ways we didn't even realize existed. I cried during several parts but was rewarded at the end with a story of self-sacrifice, redemption, and love. It's not for young children as the themes may be difficult to handle but for pre-teens and up, yes. It makes for excellent discussion with your children as to how doing the right thing isn't always easy. I read the reviews after watching and was appalled at the ignorance of others claiming it was difficult to understand due to the language. Keep in mind the accents are British and if you're that narrow minded you could always have put on the subtitles. The story itself was heartwarming and enduring though at times, depressing as heck, but the ending made it worth the tears. The cover shouldn't have a young boy and his dog on there as it alludes to a different type of Christmas story and is misleading, but if you're in the mood for a movie that is thought provoking and moving, this is it; though, keep a box of tissue handy. If you love redemptive stories such as Charles Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"" or ""It's a Wonderful Life"", then you can probably handle the theme throughout this story. Yes, at times, it's confusing with the varying stories, but if you stick with it all the through, it makes such perfect sense in its final reveal. I will watch this one again and again.",1483228800,,1565,4.514084507042254

USE THE CAPTIONS or you will miss some of the dialogue.

6259578,3,B00ID9PZD2,"This is probably the darkest Christmas story since Dickens. It starts out as a cheery Christmas Eve when Richard gets a puppy. An hour later both his parents are killed in a car crash. A year later, Richard's life is a mess. He's living with his grandmother who has dementia, he's become a pickpocket and has to pay weekly visits to his probation officer. When his dog goes missing, a very creepy stranger shows up to help Richard get his life back together. Along the way, other people become part of Richard's day, people who have lost something dear to them. It's a puzzle begging to be solved, and comedian Eddie Izzard is marvelous as the mysterious stranger who brings peace on Christmas Eve.",1482019200,,698,4.637096774193548

I am frightened of the next four years.  I believe America will loose many of its best and brightest minds to other countries.  I pray that someone some where will stand up against tbe heresy that has been forced upon us all because 49% of America failed to vote.

This is filled with eastern mysticism, clairvoyance, and false teachings that Christians will find offensive to good doctrine. The story itself was slow moving, but is all cleared up in the end.

6259709,4,B00ID9PZD2,"When I first started watching this, it was extremely depressing. Not even in a quirky way, just in a really depressing way. About 25 minutes in, I went back to look at the reviews, and people said stick with it, so I did.

First of all, this is not a ""family"" Christmas movie. I think teenagers could see it and some older kids. Second the movie is quite sad and many upsetting things happen. However, this is necessary for the ending to work.

The movie is about how several people's lives are intertwined by a tragic event that happened one Christmas Eve. This sends most of them on a downward spiral until until the next Christmas Eve, when a mysterious amnesiac man shows up and starts bringing them together.

Well, it's hard to explain. See it yourself if you're looking for something more serious than the typical holiday film.",1450396800,,834,4.583892617449664

Firstly it's a little dark.  It has a happy ending, and all that is broken is mended in the end, but it is a ""Christmas"" movie that has nothing to do with Christianity.  There is a cobra bracelet that is central to the movie's plot, and  representative of a Hindu deity.  It is the cobra deity who, as a character explains, destroys things in order to make them new.  It's not a bad movie, plot-wise.  The acting is fine in my opinion.  The characters exhibit many good qualities and values. If you are a totally secular person you'll probably like this, but if you are a Christian looking for a Christmas movie, just pass.

A little boy his his dad's car keys on Christmas Eve, hoping to keep him home from work, setting in motion a chain of tragedies. One year later, an unusual bloke shows up and...well, I wouldn't want to ruin it. Those who watch PBS and Masterpiece will see some familiar faces. An intelligent, challenging Christmas mystery with a slightly supernatural twist.

It does have a happy ending sadly we wish we could do things all over again.
And making things right again but not through magic or anything else.
But through Jesus Christ who died for our sins and not in Satan's grip which lives he destroys.
But through Jesus Christ who makes all things new again and we find we can forgive ourselves and others.
There is ONE who already give his life and no need to sacrifice our lives to make things right again.
And crying may endure through the night but JOY comes in the morning. And we find PEACE &  JOY again.
And lost souls can be restored again not just at Christmas time but all year long.

6259766,5,B00ID9PZD2,"A potential classic, on par with It's A Wonderful Life ... except this has a couple of twists.
Last Christmas Eve was a scene of horror in Manchester, UK.  Tragedies occurred left and right, starting with ten-year-old 'Goose' (Larry Mills) becoming an orphan.  A year later Goose is still living with his increasingly dotty Granny (Sorcha Cusack), and developing into quite the little sneak thief.  His closest friend is Frank (Jason Flemyng), one of his dad's co-workers whose own life in now in a downward spiral.  Into this scene comes Anthony (Eddie Izzard), an amnesiac with most remarkable sleight of hand skills and an amazing ability - when he touches someone's hand he has a vision of how they lost something precious - and even what happened to the lost item when that person wasn't around,  Bit by bit lost objects are found and restored to their rightful owners.  And only when all mysteries are solved do we find out who Anthony is, and how Goose can get back his lost dog and so much more. (Tedious note: a subplot invents a completely fictitious bibliographic history for Oscar Wilde's The Happy Prince).  Not for kiddies but immensely satisfying for adults.

6259791,5,B00ID9PZD2,This movie wasn't all butterflies and roses to watch.  In fact I'd say it leans more on the shadowy side of a Christmas movie.  In the beginning it may be hard to follow but at the end of the day it contained a good message and pulled all of the pieces of the puzzle together in a beautiful way.  A good movie to watch if you keep an open mind that this is not the traditional Christmas movie you will be watching.,1435968000,,414,4.024390243902439
6259792,5,B00ID9PZD2,"How can anyone give this movie anything less than five stars? This movie hit all the right holiday movie nerves. Uplifting, sad, sweet you name it and the emotion is here. Larry Mills as the young man of the film is outstanding. he has all of the right nuances down pat. Eddie Izzard is terrific and so is Jason Flemyng. As a matter of fact there is not one weak performance to be found anywhere on this screen. it is a story of loss and lost things, it is about redemption no matter what your age. There is a magical quality about it that I think only the British could have given it.",1435795200,4,585,4.185840707964601

6259805,5,B00ID9PZD2,"Not for everyone... it has a kind of dark feel, but I found it very pleasant.  Quite a surprise find for me:  I caught the tail end of it on cable, and was intrigued enough to purchase.  Definitely different!",1420675200,11,208,4.282051282051282
6259806,2,B00ID9PZD2,"While others raved about this film, I did not like its convoluted spirituality mixing Christian mysticism and Hindu reincarnation and 2nd chances. It makes a travesty of the Christian message that Jesus Christ is the only way to God and that ""No one comes to the Father except through Him"".  However, it deals with the the results of choices humans and angels make ( is the Juggler Lucifer, the angel of light?) and how we often do not see the long-termed implications of choices made in the confines of a moment. God's grace is unmerited but costly, costing God His very precious Son. When all seems lost because of selfish choices, grace and mercy come running to us, with arms open wide as in the story of the Prodigal Son, with the Father ever looking for his son and not resting until he returns home and then restoration and celebration enjoins in one beautiful symphony.  Don't waste your time seeing this movie, but rather spend it reading the Word of God in 2015, asking God to give you opportunities to share His love with others.",1420416000,4,1040,4.616216216216216
6259807,4,B00ID9PZD2,"Charming, sentimental Christmas story about loss, redemption and second chances.  Cast is outstanding.  Get the tissues ready--you will need them.  I saw part of this on cable and had to get my own copy.",1420416000,,203,4.911764705882353

6259810,5,B00ID9PZD2,"This movie apparently was filmed in England but that just adds to the setting. The acting is superb. It is kind of confusing at first, a little hard to follow, mystical bordering on spooky. But stick with it. It satisfies and everything makes sense in the end. A real treat for Christmas or anytime.  Will watch this one again and again.",1419724800,8,337,4.524590163934426
6259811,5,B00ID9PZD2,What a gift this film is. This is a film worth time and worth seeing.,1419465600,,69,3.6666666666666665
6259812,5,B00ID9PZD2,"When we look back, we often see other paths we could have taken, other possibilities. The ways we choose, the choices we make and sometimes believe are made for us, against our will, decide the road we continue along. Quantum physics says that every possibility that can happen DOES happen. Does that mean that we can alter the reality we are in now, in hindsight,  to the way we would want things to be? This story asks, and maybe answers, that question.

Despite the title, I personally think this transcends  any particular man made season. It speaks to the heart, and the soul. I gave it to others before even watching it myself. Upon watching it, I will be giving it to a few more people in my life. Peace, love and bright blessings.",1419379200,18,738,4.492537313432836

Well in the fist few minutes they saw two people die,a dunk peeing outside , a weird man talking about strange things, a little boy go on a home with a stranger that was in his underwear and trade stolen goods. I had to turn it off and find something fast.",1513814400,,397,4.012658227848101
8641172,5,B00ID9PZD2,"So good I want to watch it again right now! Eddie Izzard was brilliant in this. All the acting was superb. So very touching and sweet. You will find yourself laughing at moments you would think call for tears, and being moved to tears during moments that other movies might make a joke about. This movie explores the concept of actions and the impact we have on those around us. It encourages hope and faith and making unselfish choices. Do not be discouraged by negative reviews, this is a beautiful story in the vain of  'A Christmas Carol' or 'It's a Wonderful Life'. Yes, it is certainly tongue in cheek with regards to religion, - WARNING SPOILER to FOLLOW: (Shiva Statue decked out with Christmas lights) so if you are easily offended and humorless...don't bother.",1513641600,,770,4.703703703703703
