Each stand alone film is worth purchasing just for their own entertainment value, but to find all three in one offering is, for me, a perfect situation.  I have seen all 3 films, and previously owned all 3 on VHS, but to organize my collection, I decided to purchase one DVD, and donate the other, bulky and hard to store VHS editions. I always look for such bargains when replacing one type film for another, and stumbling across this compilation was a goldmine of hours of viewing pleasure. I received the DVD as promised, no damage or excessive deley. A good deal, and on time delivery. No complaints here!",1435190400,,689,4.512
