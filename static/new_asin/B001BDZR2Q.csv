3489883,5,B001BDZR2Q,"I first saw this film at the San Francisco Film festival.  For more than a year I've waited anxiously for the DVD release.  Finally, I can see it again and share it with family and friends.

The film struggled to get released because producers thought it too 'regional'.  The narrative revolves around one specific instance of land development in Austin, Texas.  Yet the conflict central to the film, the battle between development and establishment, is common to every place and to contemporary life.

Director Laura Dunn came to the festival screening and fielded several questions from the audience.  During the film, I was reminded of my surroundings when stock footage of [then Governor] George W Bush came on the screen and the rest of the SF audience around me made hissing noises.

I felt that the film was remarkably even-handed without making an effort to do so.  In other words, I think this was a great documentary that was more about bringing the story on the screen rather than putting someone's spin on it.

There is one lobbyist who is shown in a negative light (we hear his words while we only see his little fingers painting and gluing together models of military vehicles)  however, this portrayal was his choice -- he agreed to be heard but not to be videotaped & interviewed.  So the footage of model making is married to his voice-overs.

All things considered, this is one of the best docs I've ever seen, and I still get chills just thinking about it.  It should be required viewing in schools.",1225843200,3,1518,4.722433460076045
8282760,5,B001BDZR2Q,"This is the story of the efforts of the people of Austin, Texas, trying to protect Barton Springs and the underlying aquifer that feeds it and provides some of the water to City residents.  I can quibble about whether the narrative is complete or accurate in all of its details and perspective, but the film is a masterpiece.  Not often are political documentaries filmed this beautifully.  The filmmaker got surprising access to many of the most important figures.  Its a sad story but needs to be told.",1373760000,,504,4.758620689655173
8282761,5,B001BDZR2Q,"Rented this because we are relocating to the Austin, TX area and wanted to watch anything that involved that area regardless of the subject matter. Was very informative of the happenings of the extremely rapid growth of homes and apt buildings in that area and what that has done to the local waters. Very informative, though at times, it did lull you to sleep with the monotone narration...",1332288000,,391,4.764705882352941

8282763,5,B001BDZR2Q,"I'm a documentary junkie, and this is the best one I've ever seen.  Rather than creating a standard propaganda piece, the director explored each facet of this, the most difficult issue that we face as a society (individual vs. group rights).  An inescapable, gut-wrenching tension builds as we are forced to conclude that each featured proponent has merits, but alas, those merits are mutually exclusive.  The resulting paradox is almost impossible to comprehend and even harder to accept.  The film has been accused of incorporating too much poetic drift, but I think those elements are essential to the development of mood and perception.  As the stories progress, we need time to integrate the material presented so that we can truly feel what's going on, and the artistic content supplies necessary pauses in the intellectual stream.  In sum, this is a remarkable achievement in film-making.  I recommend it even if you don't find the basic subject matter (land development vs. preservation) particularly interesting.",1292630400,3,1021,5.265432098765432
8282764,4,B001BDZR2Q,"Beautiful cinematography coupled with honest, compelling interviews from all angles, make this documentary stand out. What it lacks in conclusiveness, it more than makes up for with deep, thought provoking questions.",1265587200,,216,6.0
8282765,4,B001BDZR2Q,"""All politics is local.""  And by that token, this film about specific land development issues as illustrated over decades in the life of a specific town is compellingly universal.

Texans, and Austinites in particular, are the ones whose hearts (and blood pressure) will be most affected by this documentary.  But I can't imagine an American alive who couldn't recognize some aspect of these issues playing out in his or her own state, or town, or neighborhood.

The value of this story will be most accessible to people who are already interested in government, environmental politics, and the economy.  Though made by forthright environmentalists the documentary will be fascinating to those people whether they fall on the pro-growth, slow-growth, or no-growth side of the issues, and rewards your full attention.

The filmmakers do an excellent job of getting all sorts of voices to speak their piece on camera, from former hometown boy Robert Redford and former Texas Governor Ann Richards, to a local farmer with homespun wisdom, to a couple of articulate local developers and the somewhat laconic lobbyist for the corporate interests with which they were aligned.  The most telling moment in the film for me is when that lobbyist, who formulated a pro-growth (anti-environmental) law and got it passed at the state level says -- in a completely dispassionate tone -- ""Legislature burned Austin to the ground.""  (That same lobbyist sent a note to the filmmakers when he signed his release for them to use his footage:  ""Great job!"" and drew a smiley face on the post-it.)

I also recommend the engaging bonus commentary track by the director and other crew members, who talk not only about specifics of the issues and personalities in the movie -- they are all longtime locals -- but also offer some extremely useful tips for documentarians and other shoestring filmmakers.  One thing: it's helpful when your mentor and advisor is Terrence Malick (another local).",1244246400,3,1969,5.102803738317757
8282766,5,B001BDZR2Q,"I don't remember hearing about this production.  I came across it searching for films with conservation and ""green"" themes.  This on is definitely worth taking time to see.  It's a scenario you see all over the country.  Open land purchased and turned into suburban development.

 In Austin, TX, a community fought the development plans.  The Unforseen explores the balance needed between development and preservation and the issues of environmental impact and choices between profit and protection.",1242777600,,499,5.4868421052631575
8282767,5,B001BDZR2Q,"Laura Dunn's poetic and powerful film ""The Unforeseen"" is about the growth of Austin, Texas: about farmers who want to retain a piece of land they can call their own and live on, about  developers who want to fulfill the American dream and transform the land into real estate, about local people who thought it was time to slow things down to preserve the natural character of the place they had come to love, and about lobbyists and politicians who disagreed.  The thing to notice is that what happened in Austin is a microcosm of what has been happening in communities all across the United States.  This is not a film about some special ""environmental"" question that only those who have a specific environmental agenda can appreciate and learn from.  It is about the questions we all have to face of how we are going to live and where, and what are going to be the long term consequences of our choices.

It also happens to be a beautifully made film, that manages to capture and portray a wide range of complex issues in a way that is clear and engaging and provocative, and manages also to be visually arresting and poetic. This film brings together a number of voices and visions, and what I really like is that the film does not pass judgment on these voices but lets them speak for themselves and lets us determine where we stand on the issues that are exemplified in the time and place depicted here.

Without giving away much more of what is covered in the film, I just want to mention what I took to be its most arresting and powerful message.  The film ultimately sides with the hope and belief that the values of progress, of property, of growth, and of the American dream, are not by nature opposed to the values of wilderness and of sustainability and of the environment.  What is needed is not a confrontation between the interests of those who want to live a good life and prosper and those who want to save the environment, because at bottom those interests coincide.  What is needed is the right kind of progress and the right kind of growth and dreams of a future with a real future, and for that we are all going to need to learn to listen to each other more and work harder to find common ground.  By presenting a complex set of issues and a wide range of voices in such a clear and compelling fashion, this film sets the stage for the kind of collaboration and visionary thinking essential to a sustainable future.",1235433600,,2437,4.480812641083522
8282768,5,B001BDZR2Q,"This is a must-see for everyone who loves Austin, Texas. A riveting, heart-breaking view of development in and around this beautiful, fascinating city, over the last few decades.",1233619200,2,178,5.392857142857143
8282769,5,B001BDZR2Q,"This film should be viewed by all, especially those cognizant of what is happening to land all over the country, not just in Texas. Unless we would be satisfied living in a super national suburbia dictated by the un imaginative, we need to become aware of what is being perpetrated by land use engineers now. This film is a fine beginning.",1227571200,6,339,4.573770491803279
