8742460,3,B018IOHWT6,"I had seen the trailer for this movie many times when I watched Hollywood Canteen, my favorite movie made in 1944. The stars were some of the better talent during that period but the story is so bizarre that it turned me off despite their contributions. I wanted this movie to be a keeper but I watched the whole thing and didn't get a single laugh. I watched this once and felt that it was such a lightweight movie, not even up to a ""B"" grade that I returned it.",1498435200,,463,4.155555555555556

8742465,5,B018IOHWT6,"Nothing like this movie, no where, no time.  If you have never seen ""Dough Girls"" you are in for a treat. It is funny from the first opening introduction to ""The End.""  We love this film so much, we watch it over and over again.  It's light, it's fun, it's a delight for the entire family.  Great studio actors that blend well together to make a very humorous film.

If you love the current films of today, don't bother with this one. If you yearn for relief from explosions, sexual content, and lousy film writing, try ""Dough Girls.""",1458777600,7,534,4.408163265306122
