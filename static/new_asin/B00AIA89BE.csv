5426142,4,B00AIA89BE,"This is a movie that has had little attention. There are so many villains it is hard to keep track. The good guy gets the girl, but this movie has so many twists and turns are fun to keep track of. And the cockatoo has a role to play, but a weak link in the story.",1362787200,2,264,3.732142857142857
8552020,3,B00AIA89BE,"I watched this movie at random. I bought a new TCL 65"" TV through Amazon and I wanted to see how it looked with a typical thirties detective movie. I picked one with Ricardo Cortez in it.

Cortez was a 'Latin Lover'. He was slotted to be the new Rudolph Valentino. Apparently he was good at it although he was in fact a Jew from Austria. He was in one of the original Maltese Falcon films a decade before Bogart got the part.",1529798400,,425,4.120481927710843
8552021,5,B00AIA89BE,"Love this movie, a windy hotel. Police dept that to me isn't bright, but they do check up on the fake doctor, the events leading up to all the deaths making it look like the American Visitor, the cockatoo actually didn't have much of a part in capturing the killer,  but I love this movie, youbwill to",1492128000,,301,4.280701754385965

one of the best movie purchases I've ever made !",1476230400,,100,4.315789473684211
8552023,3,B00AIA89BE,"Interesting suspense film starring Ricardo Cortez. He's worth watching the movie. True to the time there are obvious villains, mysterious weird types and fair and honorable damsels in distress.",1452729600,,193,5.689655172413793
8552024,4,B00AIA89BE,"Fun little dark-house whodunit with a clever plot and a great cast of supporting players. Leading man Ricardo Cortez is excellent as usual, and the all-but-forgotten Jean Muir, who bears a striking resemblance to Gloria Stewart, does a nice turn as a damsel in distress.  This one is way above average for a second feature.",1425427200,,323,4.872727272727273
8552025,4,B00AIA89BE,"Except for one brief scene filmed atop a cliff overlooking the Pacific, ""The White Cockatoo"" was filmed in black and white entirely on Warner Bros. soundstages in 1934 giving it a claustrophobic feeling. However, this works perfectly to maintain that moody mysterious atmosphere in the famous film noirs of the 30s and 40s. Ricardo Cortez checks into a coastal French hotel run by a strange married couple. There he witnesses strange goings on in the hotel courtyard involving a white cockatoo, a stranger who is claimed was never there but is later murdered outside Cortez's room balcony, and Cortez chases the killer into the hotel lobby, where the owners swear no one came. Later Cortez meets Jean Muir who has been a hotel resident for a year since her mother died. She awaits her brother whom she hasn't seen since she was a toddler. Both have half a secret quotation to share to claim big bucks - if they survive to collect it. The title bird unmasks the killer making the entire cockatoo cocktail a delicious mystery that should satisfy fans of the genre and is based on a novel by the late great author Mignon G. Eberhart.",1412985600,,1130,4.712121212121212
8552026,4,B00AIA89BE,I was pleasantly surprised! I have to add that on my Blu-ray player the picture was sharp and clear and the audio was perfect. Great little murder mystery and the parrot should have gotten the Oscar.,1388448000,,199,4.555555555555555
8552027,4,B00AIA89BE,"In a rather shabby hotel off the coast of France, a young girl (pretty Jean Muir) awaits a visit from her brother in New York. But there's something strange and ominous about the occupants and staff so it's not surprising when several murders occur. This whodunit should be more fun than it is. It has all the necessary trappings: a large sinister hotel with locked doors and secret rooms, constant howling winds, lights going out at inopportune moments, plenty of suspects etc. but it lacks wit. If only Nick and Nora Charles showed up, it would have helped immeasurably. Instead we get a rather unappealing Ricardo Cortez as an American visitor to unravel the mystery. The actors overdo it, they all act guilty and when one character says something, we get reaction shots of the other characters darting their eyes! Still, I'm a chump for these 1930s B&W murder mysteries so I gave it plenty of slack, others may not be so charitable. Directed by Alan Crosland (THE JAZZ SINGER). With Ruth Donnelly, Minna Gombell, John Eldredge, Walter Kingsford, Addison Richards and, of course, the white cockatoo of the title who gives the best performance in the film.

The MOD DVDr from the Warner Archives is in decent shape though it has its share of debris and a few scratches but nothing bad enough to detract from the film.",1382140800,2,1319,4.759825327510917
8552028,5,B00AIA89BE,I personally find that black and white movies made are much more interesting since producers like Hitchcock could really set moods and bring you to understand thru shadows gloom or doom.  It is certainly a fun movie and I'd rather watch film like these rather than those movies made today without character or subject that captivates your attention from the beginning.,1378252800,2,368,5.032786885245901
8552029,4,B00AIA89BE,I ordered this film because I am partial to mysteries.  This indeed is a good movie set in a off season hotel.  A strange place to have a meeting and the mysterious feeling that people are watching you and every move you make.  A secret rendezvous between a brother and sister and a fortune.  This movie will hold your interest if you like the old dark house type mystery.  I am happy that I bought this to add to my mystery collection..,1376524800,9,437,4.280487804878049
