8551357,5,B00AGGJ0RM,"Excellent film, but depressing.  I watched in two sittings because of the sombreness.  Charlotte Rampling and Gabriel Byrne are brilliant.  Rampling is so compelling on screen.  Glad to see her talents aren't wasted because of ageism such as that in Hollywood. Really wish Americans would catch up with Europeans in appreciating mature female actors, as they do mature male actors.",1476921600,,381,5.3
8551358,3,B00AGGJ0RM,"I, Anna, is a film that is difficult to explain. The true beauty of this film is the actress,
Charlotte Rumpling. Her son is the director, and he chose wisely. Anna plays a divorced
womabn trying to find her new life. Middle aged, she attends a speed dating event,
which surprises me no end.  What happens at this event is the impetus for the entire film.

Gabriel Byrne plays a police inspector/detective,investigating a gruesome murder,
which is difficult to follow because he does not act like any detective I have ever seen.
Eddie Marsan, a man you see in most UK films and series, plays Byrne's underling,
and he is more like a detective.  Byrne's character runs into Anna and becomes attracted until something does not ring true.

This film works backwards and it is a long, slow slog. Until the final twist, we are not sure what the film is about, and by that time it is too late. The acting is superb, the only saving grace.

8551359,3,B00AGGJ0RM,"I like the cast a lot and the acting was solid.  I thought I'd really like this film a lot more, but something just didn't hit the mark for me and I can't quite put my finger on it.  A big gap for me is that I missed the sequence of what happened with her and the guy; sure, I understand the sex, but what happened after that?  Maybe it was just me, but this film was just okay.",1468972800,,378,3.759493670886076
8551360,4,B00AGGJ0RM,"Dark, disturbing but poignant. One of those movies that goes back and forth in time. Charlotte Rampling is an excellent actress, and Gabriel Byrne is no slouch either. The story was intriguing and leaves you satisfied but a tad depressed. Better than some of the junk I've been watching lately. Loved the music though!",1468713600,3,318,4.907407407407407
