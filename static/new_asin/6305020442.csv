7880890,2,6305020442,"If Edward D. Wood Jr. (PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE) had ever made a kung fu film, it would resemble CHINA HEAT (1990), one of the most inept Hong Kong films yet released in the U.S. Supposedly set in New York City, it was shot somewhere in the Pacific Northwest (probably in and around Vancouver, like Jackie Chan's RUMBLE IN THE BRONX) and involves the attempts of a four-person squad of mainland Chinese police, led by the spunky Madame Wu (Sibelle Hu), to apprehend and extradite a Chinese drug dealer. In one great bit, Michael (Michael DePasquale Jr.), the New York cop assigned to them, takes the Chinese cops to what looks like a hotel dining room tricked up with a couple of lion statues and tells them, ""This is the best Chinese restaurant in Noo Yawk!""
Later, they confront ""Tony,"" the head of the New York mafia (played by someone who looks like--and probably was--a college professor) and pressure him to tell them where their kidnapped partner, Mandy, is. He breaks down (i.e. shrugs) and says, ""The shipyard, outside of town."" Without pressing for further details, they leave him and are next seen in several shots wandering around a massive shipyard, prompting Madame Wu's priceless observation, ""This is really strange. This place is so huge and there's no one here."" Mandy is soon spotted, tied up and hanging upside down from a ship's tower, screaming, ""Get back, it's a trap!"" In the ensuing battle, several bad guys spray machine gun fire at short range across an open space at Madame Wu. Not only do they miss, but when she pulls out her .38 revolver and starts shooting, the bad guys yell, ""Let's get outta here!"" and run away.
It's somewhat disconcerting to see the often excellent Sibelle Hu (DEVIL HUNTERS, FONG SAI YUK, TAI CHI II) stuck in this delirious low-budget mess of a movie. But there are a few good kung fu fights, including one featuring western martial artists Mark Houghton and Sophia Crawford (Sarah Michelle Gellar's stunt double on ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer""), and lots of continuity errors, pointless cutaways, ridiculous dialogue and unintentional hilarity.",990921600,,2101,4.871508379888268
