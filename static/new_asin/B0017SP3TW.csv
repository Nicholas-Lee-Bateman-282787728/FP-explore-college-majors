8267128,5,B0017SP3TW,"The screen looks like it's from and older version and not from the 2000s'. However, I love the story lines. It's interesting. Also, very educational and it's a lot better than a lot of the other cartoons which contain many amoral concepts in my opinion. This dvd really teaches honesty. I recommend it.",1251763200,2,302,4.716981132075472
