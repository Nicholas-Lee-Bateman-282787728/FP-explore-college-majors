8368323,5,B002EVB8JA,"This Japanese TV series is about the son of a big yakuza mobster, who must go back and graduate from high school in order to take over the gang when his dad retires. The only problem is that he is already 27, so must pretend to be ten years younger. Also, he was never good at schoolwork, and didn't even make it through junior high, so it will be a rocky year ahead.

I showed this TV series to high school students learning Japanese, and they loved it. You can add English subtitles, and the subtitles are usually quite good. I think adults would enjoy this movie as well. If you want a good laugh, buy this movie. Once I started the series, I watched it the whole way through. Great entertainment!",1306713600,4,700,4.303030303030303
