6495984,5,B00LOCL7DW,"This is another one of those long ago seen and almost forgotten Christmas stories. The best way to enjoy these is to have them on DVD and watch them whenever, instead of wondering if/or when they'll be shown.",1501977600,,208,4.5
6495985,5,B00LOCL7DW,Great Holiday Movie!,1495670400,,20,6.0
6495986,5,B00LOCL7DW,One of my absolute favorite movies!!  Had to add it to my Christmas collection. It's a sweet and endearing story but not as cheesy and with awesome actors. Some of these movies can be very repetitive and have horrible acting but this one is a standout!!,1489622400,2,253,4.5
6495987,5,B00LOCL7DW,Fun and enjoyable Christmas movie with a sweet ending.,1489190400,,54,5.111111111111111

6495989,3,B00LOCL7DW,movie was boring,1486166400,,16,4.666666666666667
6496030,3,B00LOCL7DW,It was a movie in a movie.  It was ok acting could have been better from the adults who seemed the did not want to be in it except for the paycheck.  The kids did a lot better job then the adults.  That and it seemed they did not care about some of the sets either because you could tell with the fake spray on snow on the windows with the finger streaks.  Hallmark has done better this was not worth it.,1484697600,,404,3.8902439024390243
6496031,4,B00LOCL7DW,"This has become one of my favorite Christmas movies. Even my husband enjoyed it and he usually finds these kind of movies ""sappy"".",1482710400,,130,4.695652173913044
6496032,4,B00LOCL7DW,"This is a nice movie to add to my collection of Holiday shows.  I found it to be interesting but not as engaging as some other movies that Alicia Witt has starred in, but still can honestly say I did enjoy that I did enjoy this movie.",1482451200,,234,3.978723404255319
6496033,3,B00LOCL7DW,"I can confidently say that, after watching 9 minutes of this movie, this could easily be called ""The Family Woman,"" as it is basically a female-driven version of Nic Cage's ""The Family Man."" And, much like an actual family woman, this one was done with (less than) 70% the budget of a family man. Aside from an annoyingly improperly lit green screen, this is a cute albeit waaaay clich flick. I probably won't watch it again, but I don't hate myself for watching it in the first place. You probably won't hate yourself for watching it either, if you have 90 minutes of your life that you're willing to spend on it, knowing that youll never get those 90 minutes back. However, Donald Faison IS adorable, so that may make it worth the watch right there.",1479772800,,751,4.529411764705882
6496034,5,B00LOCL7DW,Very funny movie,1476662400,,16,4.666666666666667
6496035,4,B00LOCL7DW,"A cynical TV exec looks at the perfect town inside a Christmas globe and rants about how the holiday movies she produces are as fake as the ornament. She throws it against the wall and it bounces back and knocks her out. But when she wakes up in a perfect snow-covered town, married to a local woodsman, she discovers it s not all just a fantasy.

The film is really a first class production. The story is a little bit of a retread of better films however its so well made you can't get mad. Alicia Witt seems to be in every other Christmas movie that gets made. It was also so sweet to see Donald Faison be romantic. This film is family safe. It so safe that if your single the film might even change your life. Watch and enjoy.",1473379200,3,729,4.170212765957447
6496036,5,B00LOCL7DW,"A quirky Christmas movie full of plot holes as expected.

But I just love the predictable, sentimental, romantic comedy Christmas movie and this one didn't disappoint.",1462406400,,167,5.423076923076923
6496037,5,B00LOCL7DW,Thank you!,1460073600,,10,4.5
6496038,5,B00LOCL7DW,This was the cutes family movie I've seen in years.  Great job LIFETIME.  And the two kids are ADORABLE in this movie.,1458950400,,118,4.318181818181818
6496039,2,B00LOCL7DW,"I wouldn't have bought this, except that we really love the other movie ""Snowglobe"" which stars Christina Milian. THAT is a good movie. This one, not so much.

Just like the first one, a woman is caught in a dream world, but unlike the first, the acting, story, and ""magic"" is murky and not fun. The lead woman is caught in some sort of fantasy world where she actually married the guy she liked from college, has kids, and is supposedly happy. The problem is, the lead spends the entire film not believing the fantasy and the whole town thinks she's insane.

There were times during this film when I would have turned it off, had we not been hoping for a little of that first Snowglobe fun. I don't think I would have watched the whole thing on it's own merit.",1455753600,,761,4.352112676056338
6496080,4,B00LOCL7DW,this was a good flim,1453161600,,20,3.2
6496081,1,B00LOCL7DW,"Poorly written.  Plot jumps all over the place.  Poor transitions.  Acting okay, but not consistent.  To start, the premise was poorly set up.  Why did Meg hate her job?  Why was she so cynical about Christmas and life in general?  We get the gist as the film moves along, but ...  Very bad special effects -- it was obviously sunny and warm while they were filming many of the exterior shots ... better ""snow"" definitely was called for.  The story, and genuine acting, did not come together until the last scenes when Meg is transported back to her real life, but the viewer will have to slog through a very dull production to get there.  5 stars to Christina Milian who brings the only spark of life to this turkey.",1450656000,,717,4.446153846153846
6496082,1,B00LOCL7DW,"Terrible movie. Same old story. Wooden performance, (from an 'actress' that only ever works on one-expression Christmas films which should tell you something about her 'acting' ability,) and, oh yes, a blatant and unecessary 'inclusive' social agenda thrown in by the producer. So be aware that there is an interracial couple at the centre of this film. Which should be made clear. Though what multiracial issues have to do with Christmas I don't know. It is offensive that the viewer is expected to believe that the casting of race into this film is anything other than a cynical attempt by the director and others to promote a personal agenda. And the film screamed nothing but race precisely because it wanted to pretend multiracial coupling is not an issue. Basically all through the film the issue hung over the 'storyline' as if waiting for the moment it would be addressed - as it would in life. Terrible film. Insults the intelligence with what it doesn't say, not what it does.",1449273600,2,986,4.840236686390533

6496126,4,B00LOCL7DW,"Cute movie, typical of most Christmas movies now.  The star doesn't like Christmas and is basically alone, gets hit on the head with a snow globe and she wakes up to a new life.  I wish some of these movies would actually remember that CHRISTmas is the celebration of the Birth of Christ, which this one does a little through a Christmas program.  But again, it is a cute, typical Christmas movie and we did enjoy watching it.",1423440000,,426,4.435897435897436

6496152,5,B00LOCL7DW,Our granddaughter loves this movie.  We purchased it as a Christmas gift...  She was so excited. .There is now a movie night for her and her mom WITH HOT CHOCOLATE!!,1419465600,3,165,4.466666666666667
6496153,2,B00LOCL7DW,"I didn't even finish it. Characters are ridiculously unrealistic, particularly the ""woodsman"" lol seriously?? He looked like he stepped out of a catalog. I didn't finish the end, maybe it was just me",1419465600,,199,5.0606060606060606
6496154,5,B00LOCL7DW,"I originally bought this movie because I adore the movie Snow Globe. Initially I had a hard time getting into this movie, even though I'm a fan of all three main characters and especially enjoy Christina Milian and Alicia Witt, Christina's character Sal was too random and seemed like an afterthought, and Alicia's character Meg was not remotely likeable. But eventually, much as she did with the character of Ms. Burns in Last Holiday, Alicia Witt's character finally gets it and transforms from truly detestable to very likeable in the process. There were a couple plot twists I didn't expect, and at the very end Christina Milian's role of Sal makes total sense and fits perfectly into the story. Also, as a multiracial family, we enjoy seeing movies that feature families that look something like ours where the racial makeup of the family is not central to the conflict of the movie. While race is something we deal with regularly, in positive and negative ways, it's certainly not the only part of our lives. Too often, children's books, shows, or family movies are still monoracial, and those that are multiracial often focus on race to the exclusion of all else. Multiracial children don't see themselves and their families portrayed in any other context nearly often enough.",1418947200,18,1283,4.944444444444445

6496181,5,B00LOCL7DW,I just LOVE this movie and the cut out scenes that were included makes the movie make more sense than the edited for time version that came on TV. Got to love Alicia Witt and Donald Faison.,1416960000,5,189,4.135135135135135
6496182,5,B00LOCL7DW,This is a very funny Christmas movie. Its about a woman who is a little bit like a female version of Ebeneezer Scrooge from A Christmas Carol getting herself trapped in a Snow Globe and finding out that she is the wife of her  college boyfriend and the mother of their two kids. The couples favorite song is-of all things- the Christmas hit Toyland. Saying anything more would be a big spoiler which I probably did a little of already. Anyway you should get this. Merry Christmas.,1416787200,14,480,4.517241379310345
6496183,4,B00LOCL7DW,"It's a modern take sort of on the Christmas Carol type of story, where this misguided executive works her staff overtime to get her current film project finished before Christmas. She receives a snow globe and is accidently hit in the head and falls unconscious and wakes up in the snow globe.  She finds that she is married with two daughters and has to learn to adapt and find the meaning of Christmas before she can return to the real world.",1416700800,6,444,4.481481481481482

6496186,3,B00LOCL7DW,"Predictable but kept me mildly entertained for and hour and a half while addressing Christmas cards.  Really liked the guy who played the ""husband"" but the actress who played the lead left me a little cold.  Sorry I don't remember who either one of them was as I wasn't familiar with them.  She somehow never became a sympathetic character except possibly at the very end.  Think it would have been better with more winter appropriate clothes instead of tank tops with a lightweight cardigan.  The whole movie lacked ""Christmas/winter weather"" authenticity.",1416441600,4,557,5.076923076923077

8667290,3,B00LOCL7DW,"I bought this movie on a whim and at a great price.  I liked the actors in it so I took a chance.  The basic storyline is a heartless director played by Alicia Witt is going to make everyone work through Christmas to finish a film.  Before that happens she winds up getting knocked unconscious and wakes up in a different life which causes her to change as a person as the movie progresses and she goes through several situations which help her to see what life is really all about.

I am usually a sucker for this kind of movie, but the storyline and the acting were weak and I think I am going to donate this dvd to the library.",1515974400,,630,4.139344262295082
