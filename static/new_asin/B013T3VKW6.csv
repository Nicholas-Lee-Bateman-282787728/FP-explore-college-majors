8728688,5,B013T3VKW6,"First of all, Kitaro is not good at what he does, he's AWESOME and INCREDIBLE.
You don't need words to tell stories, unless you have some listeners who are not very adept with music or arts in general.
That being said, he also have some numbers that have lyrics in it, Caravansary, for one. Or Agreement, or Impression of the West Lake, and more.
@ China Mike, you don't know anything about Kitaro, stop saying bad things about it. You said Yanni? His music is without profound feelings or soul. Not only that, Yanni also doesn't have lyrics in his music. How many Kitaro CDs do you even own? I have 58 of them so far and growing still (bet you didn't even know there are that many, did you.)
Falling asleep at Kitaro's music? Unbelievable... I play it in my car driving far away to stay focus. Just so you know I drive Audi S5 and always going fast, Kitaro keeps me focused. Also when I study or read books. Not to mention those relaxing evenings and meditation sessions, too...",1481587200,3,979,4.414364640883978

singer like Yanni add variety so we don't fall asleep  MikeY",1478736000,,207,4.024390243902439
