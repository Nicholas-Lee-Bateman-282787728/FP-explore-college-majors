The film covers the whole life and work of Burgess, giving the basics about the author. Far away from deep, (but what can you give in less than one hour) though the film is well made and complete as possible.
Great introduction for those, like me, who started as a Clockwork fan and found a much great writer hidden, the humour and language in Burgess works are the most amazing thing I ever read.
PS: The cover is of the Borges not Burgess.",1284163200,,528,4.343434343434343
