8665726,1,B00LGQVCTK,This tops it for one of the worst movies out there right now I watched it have no idea what it was about. It had this crappy music in the background and throuout the movie supposed to be dream music (?) Acting horrible. I would describe it for you but I can't because I have no Idea what to describe but I will try this guy lays in a hallway and taps into others dreams whose dreams you ask good question. Dialouge doesn't  because there is so little and what there is makes no sense. I thru this movie out !!!!!!!!  This is my reveiw di with it what you will,1424649600,,559,4.027027027027027
