8161603,4,6305794219,"""Sex, Death, & Eyeliner"" is a wonderful Gothumentary, almost perfect other than it focuses on the sexual aspect of the scene a little more than it should. Yes, sex is a part of the scene because we are such open individuals, but about half of the Gothumentary is about sex & I don't believe all that was needed. If they cut out the sex, & some of the Role Player/Vamphyre scenes it would be a perfect five stars.",1044403200,,412,4.294871794871795

8161605,3,6305794219,"While not nearly as offensive as Fox specials on the Gothic Scene, this documentary still falls just short of understanding the Gothic Subculture as a whole.  Some of the imagery is very intense and beautifully erotic but for every breathtaking scene you will have to unfortunately sit through 2 or 3 about non-gothic type role players.
The music used in this film is surprisingly good and a soundtrack might not even be a bad idea...hint, hint.  Expect to laugh as many of the scenes and people in this film do not take themselves too seriously...thank god.
I would say that if you are Gothic, interested in the subculture or just want to add more beauty to your collection you should own this film.  Just pe prepared to Fast Forward through a few parts.",974246400,4,755,4.661654135338346
