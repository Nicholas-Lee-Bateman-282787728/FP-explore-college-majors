8613837,5,B00FAOCIOW,"This is a review for this 12 movie action pack, featuring Brad Pitt and Steven Seagal. At the time of this writing, this set is just under $5 brand new w/ prime. This review is from my personal experience with this product. Your experience will vary, depending on your expectations.

Packaging: 3.5/5 stars.

There are apparently 2 different versions of this set. The one I received looks different than the amazon listing, packaged with a clear case and the way a 3 disc set should be packaged. The 2 disadvantages for this in my opinion is the way the movies are stacked, (4 movies on 1 disc. Not good quality, will be mentioned later.) and the way it holds the second disc. It's tighter, and could damage the disc if not careful with removing it. Otherwise, good packaging.

Movies: 4.25/5 stars.

Rating the movies by 3 catagories: Good, Average and Bad. These sets usually don't contain Great movies. 7 movies were good in my opinion: American Gun, Best Of The Best 3: No Turning Back, Driven To Kill, Human Trafficking, K2, Men Of War and Too Young To Die. I explain why the other movies were Average, Bad, or with comments, and also describe why. Everest is a documentary, and not an action movie. It's half the length of a feature length movie, and was originally in IMAX theaters. This is NOT the new Everest movie from universal. Not disappointed as I knew what I was getting. Good documentary, but I think it doesn't belong here. Gerry is one of the slowest paced movies I have ever seen. In a normal movie, the camera angle switches constantly. In this movie, it focuses on a certain camera for sometimes a few minutes. Want a normal movie? This one isn't for you. Want a good story that takes 100 minutes to tell? Go right ahead. This movie is recommended for making prisoners punished, because it's so slow paced. After you watch it though, you'll remember it like someone told you a good story. Gerry is Average. Birthday Girl combines multiple genres into one movie. Mainly as a romantic comedy with action/triller elements. Good for those wanting to sneak in a romantic comedy into their action collection. It's good though. Escape From Alaska is your normal low budget disaster flick. I've many others that are worse, but this one is exclusive! It uses models. Like, models of a city. Watch it and you'll see. I rate it as a Bad movie. Mask Of Death... First 5 minutes, you'll know it's lower budget. Not every Miramax movie is good... This one in my books is Average. Good selection of movies for the price. At ~$0.40 a movie, these movies aren't bad at all. Like 2, and it's worth it. I liked 3/4ths of them.

Overall: 4.75/5 stars. (Closest is 5 stars)

You can build up an action collection quick with this cheap little buddy here. The cost of a lunch at a fast food place can get you some lower end action movies, but not too low to throw it away completely. I personally thought this was completely worth my money. The other reviews were not detailed as to all of the movies. Is ""This is a pretty good movie."" Showcasing 12 movies? Nah. I understand buying it for 1 movie, but how were the other 11? Say no more. Now you know. Thanks for reading, and I hope this review helps you in deciding whether or not to purchase this item. Thanks for your time.",1458432000,3,3275,4.523648648648648
