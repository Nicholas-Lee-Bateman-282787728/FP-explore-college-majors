8422180,4,B004BR1RDM,"Unique story about Ethiopian immigrants in South Africa. Not sure what the moral of the story was - there seems to have been a lot of hinting that in vitro fertilization is evil and adoption the noble alternative - but if you can tune that out, it's a realy interesting look at something we don't often see - how African immigrants within South Africa struggle to survive.",1378080000,2,372,4.567164179104478
