2403717,1,B000B6TTAU,"I went to see this movie with my cousin, as he likes Cedric The Entertainer, and I find him ok.  I went into the movie not expecting much, and walked out with only one thing on my mind:  ""What a peice of crap""!  I mean, this movie wasn't even funny.  Who ever greenlighted this garbage wasn't thinking clearly.  And, to make matters worse than the terrible reviews and the even worse box office, they bring out this PG rated edition. Now I'm not complaining because I wasn't gonna buy this movie in the first place.  I'm just saying that even the DVD sales are going to do terrible now.  They just butchered the original show right in front of our eyes so that we'll never think of The Honeymooners as the delightfully fun TV show, but rather the horrible boring movie.  STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!!!",1131494400,2,796,4.404109589041096
2403718,2,B000B6TTAU,"I usually love movies that either Cedric the entertainer or Mike Epps are in but this movie is just horrible.

Ced and Epps take the roles of ralph and Ed from ""the honeymooners"" in a try to urbanize them as if they were 2 black males who are married and live in manhattan instead of being white like the classic ""honeymooners"" tv show.

The Negatives-This movie seems so rushed and seems no effort was but into the script and it shows in the humour quality as this movie delivers a couple of funny lines but mostly drags for most of the movie.

-It seems that Ced and Epps did this movie for the check since they seem like they aren't even having a good time doing this movie and show no type of on-screen chemistry.

The Positives-A couple of funny lines, and slight chuckles here and there do not outweigh the negatives in this movie.

Conclusion-A very horrid attempt of a Remake,No chemistry between characters, unfunny script, this movie is just another failure for Hollywood trying to remake classic shows(for example Bewitched which was slighty better than this)

2403720,2,B000B6TTAU,"I was very skeptical about this movie to begin with, not because of the cast. The casting was perhaps the only good thing. It seems like these highly talented actors were misplaced in the wrong movie. And they didn't seem to be having fun in it either. The Honeymoners is an ancient show to begin with. A remake given it's proper due of this series is pretty difficult material to tackle. To make it funny for today's audiences seems next to impossible regardless of what ethnic group or race the actors are. It's just not as funny as it once was. It would be the same as some director doing a Three Stooges remake. Some things just shouldn't be done over or dug up again. In regards to this film. It would've helped if it was funny. The audiences of today have high expectations often to a fault. I tried to like this movie though and Cedric the Entertainer is very talented and funny when he is given decent material to work with.

2403732,5,B000B6TTAU,"As a clever nod to the original show's premise, this movie works very well. I will admit that things could have been done differently to adhere more to the source material. However, this is far from the worst remake ever made. There is no raunchy humor, the plot is solid and the score gives the movie a nice retro feel. Recreating one thing while still creating something to call your own isn't an easy task but Cedric and Schultz pull it off. So please give it a shot. You don't have to be a brain surgeon or Spider Man to get this humor.

All that said, this DVD provides a nice selection of bonus features seldom seen in DVD releases today. Excellent sound and I personally like the fact that this is a full screen edition. It suits the movie's sitcom aspirations.",1413676800,,768,4.408450704225352

2403738,3,B000B6TTAU,"One could do worse than ""The Honeymooners"", and I'm certainly not going to point the obvious&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/on-a-certain-purple-aircraft/dp/B0002J4YVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">on a certain purple aircraft</a>.  At the same time, it's not like a remake to a 1950s TV classic is needed, nevermind urbanized for an audience that doesn't care for the original material.  The only two things it has going for it are the two things that determine what you like in a film: do you think Cedric the Entertainer and/or Mike Epps are funny?  If so, bring your family and have a decent time.

Unfortunately for me, I don't like Cedric and Mike.  They're two of my least favorite comedians in the stand-up business, because their material depend so much on being bumbling idiots with a stubborn attitude; some people dig this, but I don't see it as a smart or charming form of comedy.  It's the overall incompetence that get me in a bitter mood, although they did have one decent role in their career (""Barbershop"" and ""The Hangover""). Actually, their incompetence is actually in favor of the source material.  It's about two fools with attractive wives who come up with implausible get-rich schemes that never work, and while this is a premise serve to annoy, it apparently is faithful to the original formula.

And yet I couldn't suspend disbelief that Cedric and Mike's characters didn't know what they were doing. They live in the streets for their whole lives, understanding what kind of world they're living in...and they were being fooled by obvious crooks like John Leguizamo or that they didn't know they were breaking & entering private property in one scene? Sure, they make unsuccessful schemes, but they shouldn't be THAT oblivious with their surroundings. Nothing's funny about the film because of that.  The pretentious stupidity behind their actions, the obnoxiously overbearing acting that didn't go far, and lousy pratfalls.

The movie delves deep by have Gabrielle Union and Regina Hall (the wives) making deal about a duplex, but their husbands keep spending movie on useless stuff, so it's a story about the husbands learning about atonement and understand that family is important.  Well, the movie's about gambling and bidding high stakes without knowing the financial consequences, stuff that is rather immoral on a family comedy, but at least the heart is in the right place...maybe?  But seriously, the movie did try to make the characters sympathetic one way or the other, and I did grew a bit attached to Cedric and Mike's characters overtime.  I enjoyed the company with Gabrielle (who REALLY needs to be in better films than this), and at least the movie's not crass or offensive, so it's safe to watch.  That's the overall criticism I got with ""The Honeymooners"": safe.  No joke is new and no story aspect is fresh, but it's a boilerplate family comedy that's gonna cater to some people.",1282003200,,2967,5.164926931106471
2403739,4,B000B6TTAU,"New York City bus driver Ralph Kramden and his feisty wife Alice, struggle to make ends meet. Despite Ralph's many get-rich-quick schemes/motivational speaker tape series, they've managed to save some money and, along with their best friends Ed and Trixie Norton, they seem to have almost enough money for a down payment on a Brooklyn duplex. However, when Ralph decides to try to impress Alice by making up what he's lost and augmenting their savings with another of his crazy schemes, he winds up losing all their money and his marriage to boot and it takes all his determination and love for Alice to get things on track again. The movie itself is quite entertaining and Cedric, Mike Epps, and John Leguizamo gave very funny and likable performances. This movie accomplishes everything a good comedy should- genuine performances, good casting, fun and comical storyline, and a slew of good jokes. This is not a bad movie, its just a bad remake for a show that really didn't need to be remade. Overall,its a good time and I don't regret seeing it. Just don't expect The Honeymooners, because it's not.",1264118400,2,1103,4.841269841269841
2403740,1,B000B6TTAU,"I have to say that this movie was really disappointing to watch. I saw the sketch of it and was hoping it would be funny. WRONG! When I went to watch it, it was so boring and WASN'T really that funny. I feel like now I wasted my money on this! The movie didn't stay true to the original as it should be...instead they turn it into this ghetto version. The Diary of A Mad Black Woman was much more interesting and funnier than this movie. Especially Madea...hee hee. :( And Ralph didn't even say his famous line ""One of these days, Alice....POW!"". I was looking so forward for him to say that but he didn't. The only famous line he said was ""Baby, you're the greatest"". And the movie seem pretty stupid. I don't really recommend it others to watch it. I should have watched another movie.

2403741,4,B000B6TTAU,"Like many people, I am an aficionado of the classic TV series. Since most remakes or ""tribute"" films of venerable television shows are not successful and because this movie received such poor reviews, I did not see it until recently. The poor reviews are not justified. This film captures the essence and spirit of the immortal show and does so with its overall theme of working class people trying, usually unsuccessfully, to ""make it"". The references and insertion of scenes and dialogue evocative of the classic are well done and very well placed in the script. This cast studied the original and got it right. This film is a rarity - one worthy of the classic it emulates. Perhaps you had to be there at the time the original was made to know how well this film works.",1239580800,,772,4.601449275362318
2403742,1,B000B6TTAU,"I'm finally catching a glimpse of this movie on network cable TV, as it's not something I would have seen at the theater or bought on DVD.  All I can say is ""Why?""  I thought the original, black and white, fifties version of the show sucked, and even my favorite actors can't redeem it in a movie version.  The original show was horrible then; this movie is horrible now.  Why Ced and Mike Epps and Gabby didn't try and put their immense good looks and talent into another vehicle I'll never know.  But oh well, at least we have two of the three in ""Cadillac Records"" and two out of three ain't bad.

By the way--I can agree with the reviewers who said that maybe the color lines shouldn't have been crossed.  If white actors showed up in a big screen remake of ""Good Times"" or ""Martin"" or ""Amos n Andy"" or ""What's Happening"" I'd be UP IN ARMS and protesting the studio!",1231027200,,870,4.300613496932515

2403747,5,B000B6TTAU,"Loved this remake of the old favorite Honeymooners sitcom.  Always adored that sitcom.  My husband and I would watch the reruns every New Years Day during marathons.  It improved our marriage because we got to see the funny side of married life and a show where the couple was working class, poor and struggling just like us but, despite all that, they loved each other.  The remake added another commonality by showing Ralph & Alice and Norton & Trixy as Black Americans.  It kept to the show's intent of being humorous and that in a working-class marriage, love can survive.  In this movie, finally, the Honeymooners show ends on a happy financial victory.  Well somewhat victorious.  As is typical, Ralph messes up with something.  Don't we all.",1186876800,,748,4.826771653543307
2403748,3,B000B6TTAU,"First the disclaimer - I grew up in NYC at a time when the original Honeymooners series was on WPIX just about every night at 11:00 pm. As such, I've seen every episode and have always loved the show. I had heard all the terrible things about this film and was prepared for a train wreck of a movie. Surprise - there is no train wreck here! (Although there is a buried Pullman car).

This is the first movie I've seen Cedric the Entertainer in, and I can't imagine a better choice. Chris Farley might have been able to pull it off if he were alive. And Kevin James is already playing ""Ralph Kramden"" on the King of Queens (think about it - that show is basically an updated Honeymooners, except ""Ralph"" drives a UPS truck instead of a bus, and has an obnoxious father-in-law instead of mother-in-law.) I was less thrilled with the Alice and Trixie roles here, but Cedric was perfect and Mike Epps carried off an acceptable Ed Norton. No, it's not the TV series, but it's far from the worst updating of a TV show into a movie you'll find.

Having read prior reviews here, I've been a little dismayed to see all of the negativity over the fact that this was cast with black actors and actresses. So what? There is nothing inherent in these characters to prevent this story being told with either a white or black cast. Working class blue collar NYC employees come in various shades and races, and a black NYC bus driver - a black Ralph Kramden - doesn't exactly stretch the boundaries of imagination or credibility here. What's more important is that they get the spirit of the characters right, and Cedric had that spirit, Epps had enough of it, and Alice and Trixie - although they could have used a bit more - are secondary players anyway. I never viewed this as a black Honeymooners. I viewed it as an updated Honeymooners.

This isn't a great movie, but it's decent entertainment, and - contrary to a previous poster's comment - light years better than the Bewitched updated film version.

2403750,1,B000B6TTAU,"What I really hate this movie for is that they took the story from a classic tv show of the 1950's with an American white cast and turned it into a black cast for a motion picture in 2005.
  They should have used the story from ""What's Happening"" or Sanford & Son"" instead.
  Would it be right for us to take ""The Jeffersons"" or What's Happening"" and turn it into a white cast?
  When television sets were a new invention (black & white only) and only the networks of CBS, NBC, ABC and Dumont exsisted, the Dumont ""Cavalcade of Stars"" was one of the tv shows from the beginning years of television.  This show included a sketch of ""The Honeymooners"".
  Then moving on to CBS for ""The Jackie Gleason Show"", The Honeymooners took shape with Jackie Gleason as ""Ralph Kramden"", Audrey Meadows as ""Alice"", Art Carney as ""Ed Norton"" and Joyce Randolph as ""Trixie"".  This became a tv series in 1955 and on and off until 1971.
DVD includes audio commentary. Deleted, extended, alternate scenes. Option of English and Spanish subtitles.
I was against seeing this movie, but when I saw that Ajay Naidu was in it, I decided to give it a try.
  In the cast: Cedric the Entertainer, Gabrielle Union, Regina Hall, Mike Epps, Eric Stoltz, John Leguizamo, Ajay Naidu, Carol Woods, Chuy Bravo.
  They put so much light on the black actors, just so they will show up on film.
The apartment resembles nothing like the tv show.  They could have titled this movie anything, but the Honeymooners.

I really enjoy Cedric The Entertainer and just about anything he does, but this just didn't do it for me. Some of my favorite actors are black: Samual L. Jackson, Morgan Freeman, Forrest Whitacker, Ice Cube, Danny Glover. I can go on and on, but this was not the movie for the main charcters to be black. It just didn't do the same thing as back in the 50's. What the heck were they thinking?

2403752,2,B000B6TTAU,IT WAS A OKAY MOVIE WITH SOME FUNNY MOMENTS. THE PROBLEM WAS THE MOVIE BORE LITTLE RESEMBALNCE TO THE HONEYMOONERS.

MAKE RALPH A CAB DRIVER AND YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT MOVIE.,1167177600,,333,4.387096774193548
2403753,2,B000B6TTAU,"Here we have one of the most ill-conceived remakes in history, a truly forgettable film exploiting a well-known, much-loved commodity for money (and very little of it, as things turned out).  Exploiting may not be the right word for me to use here, however; it's not as if this movie sought out to make fun of the original series, and the transformation of the Kramdens and Nortons into middle-class African-Americans carries no kind of overt or underlying statement whatsoever.  The only problem with this odd movie is its failure to be very funny.  I've always said that Cedric the Entertainer is always funny.  Well, I can't say that anymore.  I did get a few laughs over the course of the film, but watching this modern version of The Honeymooners is sort of like watching a fish out of water: initially, it's sort of funny to watch it flop around all over the place; before very long, though, it starts to get boring, all that activity begins to slow down more and more as it makes its way to a painful death, and you're left just standing there, hoping to sneak away before anyone notices you were ever there to begin with.  Someone really should have thrown this fish out of water back.

None of the actors seemed to have his heart in what he was doing.  Cedric had his moments, but they were few and far between, and I couldn't help but notice that even he seemed rather uncomfortably embarrassed delivering his final and fully predictable line at the very end.  There was no real chemistry to be found among the actors, either.  Gabrielle Union is a lovely young actress, but she just doesn't have the feisty nature of a true Alice Kramden; she's just too nice for the role.  Mike Epps didn't exactly scream Ed Norton to my brain, either.

Plot-wise, there's not much to talk about.  Alice and Trixie want to have a home of their own, and Ralph's many get rich quick schemes prevent them from putting a down payment down on the duplex they've found.  Ralph scrambles around, jumping from one hare-brained money-making scheme trying to get the money back before Alice finds out it's gone.  From sewer-bound trolley cars to dumpster dog racing, Ralph just keeps getting himself closer and closer to the proverbial doghouse.  Throw an embarrassingly trite ending on this puppy, and you've got The Honeymooners movie in a nutshell.

The fact that Cedric the Entertainer isn't even very funny in this movie tells you all you need to know about the script.  It's all just incredibly bland and lifeless; I never even felt like I was watching a movie.  Personally, I think the film might actually have done better without a tie-in to classic television's The Honeymooners, as that really just set this decidedly weak film up for a fairly substantial fall.  On its own merits, I would give The Honeymooners two and a half stars - the writing is weak, the characters have little depth, and the whole movie just isn't that funny.  I have to round that down to two stars, however, in deference to the Great One, who may or may not have been spinning in his grave when this film was released.",1148515200,6,3088,4.639705882352941

There are some great lines in this movie - ""I don't want to marry her for her money, but I don't know how else to get it"",  ""I started out with nothing and still have most of it left"" . . .

2403756,2,B000B6TTAU,"I have nothing against the idea of turning a classic television show into a theatrical film.  Such films can work in extremely different ways (e.g., ""The Fugitive,"" ""The Brady Bunch,"" Charlie's Angels""), although they are the exception rather than the rule (e.g., ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" ""The Wild Wild West,"" ""Leave It to Beaver,"" ""Bewitched,"" ""The Dukes of Hazzard,"" ad infinitum).  I also do not objective to recasting such a film with African American actors and can accept that working either when the race reversal is part of the film's dynamic (e.g., ""Guess Who?"") or something that is never commented on, which is what we have here with ""The Honeymooners.""  I prefer the former, but the latter also qualifies as a political statement in that just accepting Cedric the Entertainer as Ralph Kramden says something.

I understand that there are plenty of people who are offended by the idea of ANYBODY playing Ralph besides Jackie Gleason, and once the Great One has been recast you know something is going to try and commit the ultimate outrage and remake ""I Love Lucy.""  But Ralph Kramden represents an archetypal character as the incompetent head of the family.  Remember that the 1950s were the time of Jim Anderson on ""Father Knows Best"" and Ward Cleaver on ""Leave it to Beaver.""  It is Ralph Kramden who serves as the link between those edifices of fatherly wisdom and the likes of Archie Bunker and Homer Simpson, and if they keep letting new people play Hamlet and Superman, then Cedric can try wearing Jackie's pants.

That being said, my problem with ""The Honeymooners"" has to do with the script much more than the performers.  Fifty years later he classic situation comedy has been turned into a romantic comedy, albeit one in which the couple are married a couple of minutes into the film.  In fact, I though the film's prologue got this 2005 comedy off on the wrong foot in several key ways.  ""The Honeymooners"" became in media res, with Ralph and Alice ""happily"" married, if constant bickering constitutes some form of happiness.  Part of the mystery is why these two were married in the first place.  But the screenplay begins with Ralph and Alice (Gabrielle Union) meeting and him trying to impress her.  Apparently he does, although neither the dance he does nor his Y2K Survival Kit are capable of doing the job.  The next thing we know Ralph and Alice are married and yelling at each other.  Under the circumstances set up here this strikes me as tragic rather than as funny.

This is not to say that a couple cannot fight and still love each other.  Just watch ""Gilmore Girls"" when Luke and Lorelai go at each other.  But the prologue makes it seem like these two should not be fighting.  I also think there is a major casting problem with Alice because Gabrielle Union is simply too fine for Cedric.  Remember: he does not do anything in the prologue to suggest he is not as selfish as she accuses him of being when things come to a head in the film over Ralph's attempts to strike it rich.  Ralph COULD be loveable, but given what we see from the start of this film to pretty near the end, he simply is NOT.  At best, he stops being selfish and only has some minimal notion of what it would mean to move in the other direction.  This time around Alice and Trixie (Regina Hall) are both more interesting, and I was hoping that maybe they would become actively involved in making things work out, but that did not be the case.  I also thought that the villain played by Eric Stoltz would amount to something specific, but he ended up being a one-dimensional figure, and while John Leguizamo is always worth watching, why let him upstage Ed Norton (Mike Epps), who is supposed to spend his time upstaging Ralph?  Can you name a guest star who ever stole a scene from either Jackie Gleason or Art Carney?

The script here is written by Danny Jacobson (""Roseanne""), David Sheffield (""The Nutty Professor"") and Barry W. Blaustein (""Coming to America""), and Don Rhymer (""Big Mama's House"").  Seeing that many writers on a film is usually not a good thing, and ultimately my objection to the film is that everything is by the numbers.  Ralph is the anti-Midas, so that all of his best laid plans to make a quick buck will fail, either because they were stupid in the first place, Ed finds a way of messing them up, or simply the gods look down and laugh (which is more than the audience does for most of this film).  The happy ending is not so much a contrivance as it is uninspiring.  This film wants to have a heart, but it needs to be better connected to a better brain for it to really work.  You cannot accuse these actors of not showing proper respect for those who came before them, but you can fault the writers for not coming up with something worthy of the Gleason-Carney-Meadows-Randolph legacy (and the producers for not insisting on it [and director John Schults (""Like Mike"") for not recognizing it was not here]).",1137283200,,4950,4.634593356242841

2403761,1,B000B6TTAU,"""It's alive!"" The infamous words by Dr. Frankenstein could not even bring back a sitcom that has been dead for over a half a century.  However, director John Schultz gives his best effort to remake the sitcom from 1955 with a new adaptation into the theaters, as he casts Cedric the Entertainer and Mike Epps as his sidekick.  Together with these two comedians, Schultz tries to poke fun of the economical situation of a family, and their attempt to gain the American Dream in a swift and easy manner.  However, nothing is easy or swift, as it sets up a myriad of slapstick situations and silly humor.

The film begins to set up the story in New York in the fall of 1999, as Ralph Kramden (Cedric the Entertainer) drives a bus while displaying his dreaming persona.  It also shows how he met his future wife Alice (Gabrielle Union) and his deficient skills in business through a Y2K survival kit.  Six years later, Ralph is still a bad businessman and a bus driver who keeps dreaming of the big deal.  However, his relationship with Alice is no longer as sweet, as it was when he met her for the first time.  Now Ralph has to deal with the responsibilities of being married while he also secretively tries to juggle shady business deals in order to make quick money.  However, whenever the truth catches up with him, and it usually does, Alice throws her wrath over him.

Honeymooners' storyline focuses on both Ralph and Alice, but also on their neighbors and friends Ed (Mike Epps) and Trixie (Regina Hall).  Alice and Trixie have decided to buy a duplex before the entrepreneur William Davis (Eric Stoltz) buys the building, but in order to do that they have to have $20,000 within two weeks.  This presents a problem to Ralph, as he has squandered some of their money on a supposedly get-rich-quick deal.  It causes further problems for Ralph, as he and Ed begin to look for another quick deal.  The dumb thing is that they do not understand when they have a good deal, and they do not know what good business is.  When they are lucky to find a sure winner, even then they mess it up.

The story is a sad mess moving in a predictable direction and the silly jokes do not make it any better.  Sure, the audience will find opportunity to laugh, but so do people when a stranger tells a funny joke.  In Honeymooners the story feels forced while even the performances feel like a bunch of bad skits put together in order to create something that looks like a storyline.  With a budget of 27 million dollars, it should raise some questions such as why they green light the project, as it still requires a lot of rewriting and reworking.  Maybe in another 50 years, a remake of Honeymooners (2005) will be available that they have been able to revitalize through a proper script that has some life in the story.",1131753600,8,2809,4.513833992094861
