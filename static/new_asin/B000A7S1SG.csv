8075976,3,B000A7S1SG,"Mostly local amateur video.  Sound quality is terrible.  I did like it though as it was filmed in an area I'm familiar with so I had a bit of a connection.
Good interior shots and cockpit action.  Still the most beautiful plane ever made.  The Connie was also the first plane I took a trip in as a boy.  It was Pacific Northern Airlines from Seattle to Juneau, Alaska in 1967.  Pretty cool.",1489795200,,390,4.273972602739726

8075978,4,B000A7S1SG,"As did another reviewer, I went ahead and purchased this video despite a negative review. I am extremely glad that I did. I happen to think that the Lockheed Super G Constellation, particularly when outfitted with TWAs spectacular red and white livery of the day (unfortunately not shown in this video) is one of the most beautiful airliners ever built. I was pleased to find this video, which provides an in depth look at parts of this aircraft that most of the public has never seen.

There are two Constellation aircraft featured in the video, a model 749 and a model 749a (a slightly sleeker silhouette than the model 749) both of which have been restored to original flying condition. Both aircraft were originally military aircraft and as such have never had passenger cabins in the sense that commercial aircraft do.

The model 749 (also called the Dutch Constellation in the video since it was restored for an aircraft museum in the Netherlands) was originally a military cargo aircraft. It was later refitted as a private passenger aircraft for a military VIP and after a number of years in that role, it was sold to a private firm where it was converted for service as a pesticide sprayer. It was later abandoned then acquired and restored by a Super Constellation Flyers Group.  The model 749a was a M.A.T.S. (Military Air Transport Service) aircraft which has also been restored.

There are many interior shots of the cockpit during flight as well as a preflight tutorial of the flight engineers panel. There are shots of take-offs, landings, stall tests, and airborne engine stop/re-start tests among others. All of the flight activity occurs from airports in the Tucson, AZ area. A few of the shots are marred slightly by some dirt on the exterior of the aircraft windows but overall, the photography ranges from very good to excellent.

This video appears to have been made during the time period of 2002-2004. The entire video involves only the two aforementioned restored Constellations in a contemporary setting and includes narration. There is no historical video of Constellations during the 40s, 50s, and 60s but we are fortunate to have commentary from veteran Constellation pilot Captain Frank Lang to provide historical context as he flies the two aircraft.",1432857600,,2281,4.960732984293194
8075979,4,B000A7S1SG,"Despite the negative review and I purchased this DVD. It was a bit pricey but I am glad I did. It has a home movie feel to it maybe because it was filmed by the pilots, mechanics and engineers who restore and fly this classic aircraft, but it makes you feel like a guest on board. Their love of this aircraft is evident. For me the flight engineer's description of the gauges and controls for controlling and synchronizing the engines was worth the price of the DVD. There are gauges for manifold air, oil and fuel temperatures and pressures, cylinder head temps, carburetor throttle and mixture controls, throttle de-icing controls, there is even a little oscilloscope showing what looks like secondary ignition voltage traces. Very cool if you have an interest in engineering. The flight engineer continuously monitors and adjusts all these controls while you relax back in coach with a martini  and a ""Saturday Evening Post"". And those engines kick out a LOT of smoke when starting up! Of course there are scenes of Connie takeoffs, flight and landings from inside and outside the aircraft. Maybe there are some slow spots and too many views of the engines in flight, shot through the windows. However, if you never get to ride in or see one, this is the next best thing. I am glad there are people donating their time to restoring and flying these graceful and historic aircraft.",1382313600,,1383,4.7625
8075980,1,B000A7S1SG,"Although I am an ardent Connie lover, and have been intimately involved with Constellations for years, I found this disc very boring, pilot Frank Lang over indulged in his own ego, and the entire flight sequences extremely ho hum, yawn, wake me when it's over, etc.  Don't buy this disc, save your money for a Corgi Die Cast model of the Connie instead.  You'll get more enjoyment out of it than this video.",1129852800,,407,4.561643835616438
