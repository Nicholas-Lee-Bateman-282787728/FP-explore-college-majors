6797718,5,B00PCSVKX6,"What a TOTAL twist, at the end!
By it's original description, not even close!
This movie was definitely worth watching.
My girlfriend liked the original title and description.
For me, because she liked it, I wanted to see it.
The plot was well worth it.
If you like ""surprise"" endings, you'll love this movie.",1442620800,4,309,4.7407407407407405

6797722,4,B00PCSVKX6,Interesting movie.  I would have liked for them to take it a bit deeper into the BDSM stuff before it gave away the twist.  I would have like to see her tormented more.  I think that would have made the ending different,1432771200,6,219,4.166666666666667
6797723,2,B00PCSVKX6,"This film is another S&M film hoping to ride on the popularity of ""50 Shades."" Sabina (Stephanie Edmonds) is kidnapped, stripped, and abused (but not raped). The title lets you know it is some kind of play acting. In the film there are flashbacks to her being kidnapped as well as a discussion with a doctor (Chris Soth). Sabina seeks out abusive relationships because of what happened to her. The question becomes is this the incident or the cure?

The acting, dialogue, and plot was fairly boring.",1431388800,7,499,4.735632183908046

8687431,2,B00PCSVKX6,"This movie has as much in common with BDSM as a tomato does with vegetables.  It will commonly be confused and often found in the same area; but the truth is they are not the same.

The movie, while having an interesting story line is more of a thriller with a horrible representation of BDSM.

If you want to see a bit of a twist to a story and like sub-average acting and slander of the BDSM world, then this is one that you might like.

The gore is not believable, when you get to the end you will question why many scenes happened, and if you know anything about BDSM you will spend half the movie wondering why no one stopped the events that occurred.

The positives to the movie are the ""kidnapper"" is the most realistic character.  The story line, while a bit messy is a clever idea, and the character development is done in a way that leaves you wondering about the individuals through the movie (a key part of any thriller).

If you are looking for nudity, BDSM, violence, or gore.  This is not your movie.  If you are looking for something that is just entertaining enough to keep watching, then I recommend watching this with some friends Mystery Science Theater 3000 style.",1452556800,6,1185,4.423963133640553
