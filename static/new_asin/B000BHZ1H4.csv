2798173,5,B000BHZ1H4,Terrific idea. Fabulous photography. Entertaining from beginning to end. BBC at its very best. Highly recommended. Bring on the next series.,1357776000,2,140,5.714285714285714
2798174,3,B000BHZ1H4,"I had thought this would be an in-depth history of the coast of GB. Instead, it is a fluffy - fun skip around the coast with a few interesting tid bits thrown in. It is really more of a tourism piece. There is nothing particularly wrong with the series, it just isn't substantial enough to hold ones attention for more than a few episodes.",1352764800,2,339,4.3125
2798175,5,B000BHZ1H4,What series are included in this set.  It doesn't say anywhere on the images provided.  I'm looking for series 5,1349222400,,112,4.55
2798176,5,B000BHZ1H4,"This series was very informative, enjoyable, and the scenery magnificent.  I also enjoyed the visits to the other countries coastlines.  We will definitely watch it again and again.",1345161600,,181,5.428571428571429
2798177,5,B000BHZ1H4,"Scenery, information, everything first class.  It is something you could watch over and over and not be bored.  We took several days to watch all the episodes.  We wanted to savor every moment.  Coast is well worth the money to purchase.  It is definitely something to keep and watch again and again.  We need more of these type of programs instead of all the crap that is out there.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coast/dp/B005N8KPAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coast</a>",1334361600,3,509,6.0
2798178,5,B000BHZ1H4,"The product was delivered promptly. Coast is an extremely interesting series. Not only does it portray the magnificent coastlines of the British Isles and Europe, but also historical and current life in the areas visited. I would definitely recommend this set if DVD's to people of all ages.",1332547200,4,291,5.083333333333333
2798179,5,B000BHZ1H4,"The 8 discs are to be watched and enjoyed. The photography is outstanding but I question, how did they get all those sunny days? The history tossed in here and there was great. The movement from a variety of  coasts was bonus. I do hope there is a sequel.",1331424000,2,255,4.204081632653061
2798210,4,B000BHZ1H4,"I wish this was the entire series. My family and I have been watching the series on our region-free dvd. I picked this up (mistakenly), thinking this was the whole series in a compiled form. It isn't. It's just select episodes. Disappointing.  If you don't mind not seeing the series in it's entirely you might enjoy this selection of episodes. Granted not every episode in the original series is awe inspiring, I just prefer to see the whole thing not just the series cherry picked.

What is the series about? The coast of England/Britain and the history and culture of the coast. There is lots of fantastic photos, stories and science as well as interesting tales of historic events. Each episode talks about half a dozen things as the narrators journey slowly around the coast.

Overall this is a great series which deserves to be watched. The photography and educational value is high. I just stopped buying abridged stuff years ago and hope that a full complete unabridged edition will also be produced.",1409875200,11,1008,4.815028901734104
2798211,5,B000BHZ1H4,"I first saw this series on the BBC when I lived overseas and loved it. Glad I could find it on DVDs. A wonderful blend of culture, history, stunning photography and writing. Excellent, excellent, excellent.",1405123200,,206,4.914285714285715
2798212,4,B000BHZ1H4,"Although I now live in the USA, I am of British origin and this series was highly recommended so I was very pleased when it became available in the US. I found it basically very interesting but I think it could have been much better. My main criticism is that, like so many programmes, it has been dumbed down as though the viewer is not very bright. It is the content that is important and the antics of the ""talent"" should never be allowed to detract from that. I don't see why it is necessary for the person speaking to consistently walk out of the shot as soon as he or she has said their piece - as is they had an urgent need to visit the bathroom! Or, as an alternative to this, be talking to the camera over his or her shoulder while on the move. This is a distraction and has become such a cliche - especially in British documentaries. I much prefer the straight, interesting and informative style of David Attenborough. Obviously the host is entitled to wear his hair as long as he likes but it becomes a distraction and takes away from what his is trying to say when the wind blows it all over his face so he has to keep pulling it back. Tie it in a ponytail or something!

I greatly admire professionalism in any endeavour and enjoy watching professionals do their thing so I have a dislike of being required to watch amateur talent having a go. For example using the adze on a piece of wood and, not surprisingly, making a mess of it. Please just allow us to watch and admire the real guy demonstrating his skill.

Obviously, there had to be choices made of what to include and what to leave out but they did omit some very interesting and important places. For example, they visited Rockall - which was very interesting - but they left out St. Kilda which is a really fascinating place with amazing history. At the end of the Crinan Canal they were within a couple of miles of the notorious Gulf of Corryvreckan where George Orwell nearly lost his life and the house where he wrote his book 1984 right around the corner on the island of Jura.

They went to the Orkney Islands but never mentioned or visited the memorable neolithic settlement of Scara Brae occupied from around 3180 BC. I would have thought that this should certainly have been on the list. They visited the Lofoten Islands but never mentioned the genuine origin of the word ""maestrom"" and did not visit it.

Hopefully there will be other episodes to come to fill in the many gaps but please don't talk down to the viewers and for goodness sake let the talent just say what they have to say and then cut to the real content. So much of this series is excellent and the concept is imaginative but please less gimmicks.",1399593600,3,2696,4.375249500998004
2798213,5,B000BHZ1H4,"Great production, great stories, very good talent.  It's the best way to visit the UK coast without actually being there.",1381536000,4,121,5.05
2798214,5,B000BHZ1H4,Another outstanding informative presentation by Neil Oliver. A great way to learn about the coast of England. Looking forward to more.,1380931200,4,134,5.428571428571429

2798216,5,B000BHZ1H4,Would recommend this to keep in collection. Came through quickly and have no trouble watching it even though it is out of zone for us.,1379894400,2,134,4.4
2798217,4,B000BHZ1H4,"Great aerial photography of UK coast and other countries coasts that influenced UK such as Ireland, France, Norway, Denmark, Tell interesting historical stories of the area being explored in each episode as told by several different correspondents. They look at sealife above and below, coastal geology and tides, historical sites and villages, industrial/business changes over time. Relate unique features and occupations of coastal communities.",1362873600,8,446,5.984375
2798218,5,B000BHZ1H4,"If you like geography, and are interested in the British Isles and surrounding region, I think you'll love this series.  It seems to be a ""best of"" compilation, with most, if not all, of the ""And Beyond"" season included, as well as some highlights from past years.  The BBC spent some money on the series and it shows.  Super graphics, used for educational effect instead of glitz.  An enthusiastic group of presenters.  Gosh, I wish I could go see these places for myself.  Maybe, someday ....",1359936000,3,494,4.686046511627907
2798219,5,B000BHZ1H4,I ordered this because I liked the History of Scotland so much. This one is good too. I think the thing that makes his work so good is the fact that he is interested in the same things the general public is interested in. He asks questions we would ask. The quality is great as usual and the other presenters are interesting and funny and make it a joy to watch.,1358121600,10,362,4.112676056338028

8185898,5,B000BHZ1H4,"This DVD is awesome! My husband and I look forward to watching an episode each night. We have been to Scotland, Ireland and several parts of Britain and find the history and pictures absolutely amazing. We love Neil Oliver - also have History of Scotland with him and it too is great.
