The concert flowed with some of my favorite music selections, the artists performing beautifully and seemingly effortlessly. Julia Fischer was superb! The varying views of Grafenegg only added to this wonderful experience.  Having the DVD, I now have the opportunity to revisit the Gala whenever I wish!",1458864000,,381,5.129032258064516
