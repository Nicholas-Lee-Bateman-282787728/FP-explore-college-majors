8104050,3,B000E1OI5S,"This was a low-budget production with amateurish actors who had bad timing.  Still, I didn't find the work absolutely revolting.  If you have nothing better to do then you can sit through this.
The description of the film made it sound like double-, triple-, and quadruple-crossing would take place.  There are double agents here, but the plot was not hard to follow, unlike many double-crossing films.  I thought this film would have the moral that ""If you lie down with dogs,"" but the film later makes it clear that they expect you  to identify with the main character, even when he is being shady.
The film has a more racially diverse cast than ""The Dope Game.""  It is also more diverse in actors' weight where not every single character is obese.  In a country that is 51% female, I'm surprised that the only woman in this film was a sleeping blonde who never spoke one line.
This film had a fake beatdown.  The characters steal diamonds that are far too large to be real.  Obviously the film creators think people are stupid enough to think fake bling-bling can be real.  There is a lot of homophobic epithets here and I wasn't cool wit dat.  Actors recite lines in deadpan tones when they should have been yelling.
I mean, this film would never win any award besides a Razzie.  Still, there's worse garbage out there and so this won't absolutely make you want to gag.",1262995200,2,1373,4.581967213114754
