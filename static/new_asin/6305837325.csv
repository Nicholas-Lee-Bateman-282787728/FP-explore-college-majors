1086141,4,6305837325,"I have seen the first 2 episodes of The Pacific and am truly in awe of the production.  It is so well done, so authentic and, quite frankly, a bit scary.  Scary to think what these people went through - this was the price that was paid for our freedom as Americans.  Besides being informative and educational, this mini series inspires a great sense of pride in being American and a great appreciation for what we have in the 21st century.  I would recommend it without hesitation, however, it is not, in my opinion, suitable for children under the age of 18.",1270771200,4,559,4.450980392156863
1086142,5,6305837325,"I've read the other reviewers' comments, pro & con, and am aware of the obvious comparisons of the other major works by the same production team. Comparison is tempting but the Pacific and Atlantic Theaters of war were so different in their basic strategies as to, in my opinion, defy comparison. In Europe, the Allies invaded at Normandy after securing north Africa and the Mediterranean. This made a two front war for a ""stand alone"" Germany a reality. The strategy for the Allies was to gain control of occupied geography and liberate populations. The strategy differed in the Pacific because the geography was sparsely populated by comparison and much more vast in scale. Control of airspace and the sea was viewed by both sides as essential to victory. This dictated the nature of strategies including the deployment of resources, i.e men and materials in a way devised to cut off enemy resources and destroy supply lines. ""Island Hopping"" gave the Allies that desired result without having to sustain the casualties which would have occurred with the liberation and occupation of thousands of islands. BofB reflects the nature of a huge array of armed might focused on defined geographic goals as it relates to a single unit involved in the effort from invasion to VE Day. TPac, dictated by the nature of the war was less cohesive with much smaller numbers (per action) involved in smaller geography and, by necessity, demanded a more complex mobility than was the reality in Europe. There was also a good deal of interservice rivalry that was less than ""good natured""...witness the truck scene when the Army driver does not even make the attempt at avoiding the Marines on Gualdalcanal. My father, an officer in the US Navy from the outset of the war, referenced a comment he said was oft repeated in the Pacific...""the Navy shells it and softens it up, the Marines land and fight to take it, the Army shows up to occupy it.""

I find the series to be a very believable representation of what I've read and learned growing up from the conversations of those who were there. Kudos to the producers whose efforts have, thus far, shown the differences between the theaters and the impact on the men who fought in them.",1270512000,49,2221,4.81413612565445

1086144,5,6305837325,"THE PACIFIC, a ten episode HBO series just begun, promises to be much more than many expected.  It is, of course, the true story of the battle for the Pacific theater from December 8, 1941 on and features the Marine Corps battles against the Japanese for this important stage of World War II.  The writers and directors and actors take great pains to show both sides of the conflict: there is the expected use of expletives and pejoratives against the Japanese, but at the same time there is meaningful time spent with the frightened and sorrowful looks in the eyes of the Marines who are killing the Japanese 'like a turkey shoot' - especially in one scene where the lone surviving Japanese soldier (Yoshi Ando) stands against the marines, wounded and crying until out of pity a Marine shoots to kill him, releasing him from the tragedy of war.  It is a purgative moment.

The banks of Australia make for good backgrounds as the Marines land on Guadalcanal and the fighting that follows is played with suspense and then horror.  But all along the progress of the film we are introduced to the personalities of these young kids who were fighting for their homeland.  One image that will remain in the viewer's mind throughout this series is the set of maps of the world behind the de-briefing officer: all of Europe on the Atlantic side  of America is colored red with the Nazi swastika symbol while the Pacific side is covered with the advancing red and yellow fag of the Japanese.  America looks very small in the middle and makes us remember why the country felt so attacked during that particular war.  it is a sobering memory.

THE PACIFIC  has a cast of mostly unknown actors (except for star Jon Seda) but with the faces of men like Joshua Biton,  Joseph Mazzelo, Toby Leonard Moore, Jon Bernthal, Tom Budge, James Badge Dale, Ashton Homes and Jacob Pitts among many others theses actors will likely join the ranks of those who played n the similar European front in BAND OF BROTHERS.  From all indication this will be a very heady series and one that will burn in the minds of viewers for a long time. Grady Harp, March 10",1268611200,11,2130,4.603174603174603
1086145,4,6305837325,"Last night was Episode 1 of this miniseries.  I have been looking forward to its airing since I first heard about the project a year or two ago.  Over the years, I had read the Robert Leckie and Eugene Sledge combat memoirs on which the miniseries has apparently been substantially based, and found both books very informative, sobering and enjoyable.  The other couple of books that are cited as sources I am not familiar with.

Born in 1952, I have always had a special interest in what my parents (and Ken Burns!) referred to as ""the War.""  This has taken me -- and probably hundreds of thousands of baby boomer males! -- from consuming juvenile literature (e.g., Landmark Books) early in life about this or that aspect of WWII, to watching virtually all the major WWII movies and documentaries, and ultimately to reading a great deal about the war throughout my adult years.  So I have acquired solid familiary with many details about WWII ... although I do fall far short of being single-mindedly fascinated by it as a re-enactor perhaps would, plus it is not a formal part of my professional life, as it would be for a historian of WWII or a merchant selling WWII militaria.

Yet I am NOT a Stephen Ambrose-style World War II romantic as I once was -- Howard Zinn cured me of that!  I am simply drawn to the story of the world's upheavals around the middle of the last century, both in their epic scope and human scale.

So, that is my basis for commenting on this new miniseries -- or rather, the first episode.  Assuming that Ep. 1 is representative of the series in focus, style and overall quality, it's good stuff.  It will be nearly impossible to avoid comparing and constrasting The Pacific (TPac) with Band of Brothers (BofB), since both series were produced by the same team (Hanks, Spielberg et al.) and have many thematic similarities.

BofB has since become famous and was always beloved as a hymn of praise to the most admirable qualities of the U.S. American of the era -- qualities which many claim they would like to see resurrected across a greater share of our current population.  It has been in a league of its own as a portrayal in depth of a small unit, and has become a symbol of the WWII citizen-soldier (""we all joined the military because we were attacked, and that's just what you did in those days, a guy in my neighborhood killed himself when the recruiter turned him down for health reasons,"" etc.).  Perhaps TPac will do as much for the WWII citizen-Marine.

One of the features of Ep. 1 that I liked was a speech by historical figure Chesty Puller (played by Wm. Sadler, whom you'll recognize from the stuttering prisoner in Shawshank Redemption and a rogue military officer in The Rock).  Puller talks to a roomful of Marine NCOs not three months after Pearl Harbor about their special role as the backbone of the Marine Corps and that they will carry their young, less experienced men through the oceanic operational theater that Puller says the U.S. government has handed over to the Marines ... ""Hitler and Mussolini are reserved for the Army, until they discover they can't kick their butts without our help,"" that sort of talk.

I don't know if such a speech actually took place with Puller and the NCOs, or if the Pacific theater had yet been envisioned as the island-hopping project that Puller talks about in the speech.  What I liked was his description of the Marine NCO as a special figure in the culture of the Corps ... if that was NOT something that was set in place at the time, it does at least give the viewer something to hook into as to why and how Marines are not ""soldiers.""  And that would be something of importance as a pillar for this series.

Another thematic basis for this series appears to be an examination of the feelings the Marines had for the Japanese.  The relationship between adversaries differed in Europe and the Pacific.  Collectively, the Japanese and U.S. American adveraries absolutely hated each other from bases in race and ethnicity ... a few books in recent years have explored this.  I was impressed that some shoots of this theme appeared in Ep. 1.  That kind of hatred is not something that many U.S. American citizens and institutions of today will be comfortable looking at ... think of how the Ben Affleck movie Pearl Harbor paid virtually no attention to it.

In Ep. 1, though, the Japanese are called all sorts of ugly names ... but that's what I understand to have been so ... and U.S. Americans produced in the Japanese an equivalent level and type of disgust and hatred.  In one scene -- in its way as grueling as the scene in Saving Private Ryan in which the German soldier knifes the U.S. Army private in a hand-to-hand fight in a building -- a Japanese survivor of an intense skirmish pops out of the trees near a stream.  One or two scenes earlier, a wounded Japanese is assisted by a couple of Marines ... and all three or four of them die as the Japanese explodes a grenade he has hidden under his injured body.

The Japanese by the stream, then, is shot by U.S. Marines on the opposite bank but strides into the water, weaponless, howling insults (I presume) at the Marines.  They continue shooting at him, at first hitting him without killing him.  On the soundtrack, you can hear the Marines' hoots and catcalls -- and bitter laughter.  They are playing with this man who is culturally unfathomable to them, entertaining themselves as they do their best to excruciate him.

In duration and editing, the sequence was perfect, in that when the ""entertainment"" ended because one Marine shot the Japanese with a coup de grace, I as the viewer had been put in the shoes of the Marine characters in the sequence.  It felt delightfully transgressive at first -- the usual rules have been lifted! -- when deploying the power of personal weapons with impunity.  It felt progressively uncomfortable at having done so, however, even though men in the same uniform as the Japanese in the stream had done awful things to other men in U.S. Marine herringbone twill ... the ""good guys.""

I liked the fact that the casting placed young-looking men in the various roles. This is now standard operating procedure -- except for departures like middle-aged Tom Hanks playing a Ranger captain, who would have actually been in his middle or late twenties at the most, in Saving Private Ryan.  Speaking of which, the scene of approaching the invasion beaches of Guadalcanal was basically an homage to the equivalent scenes in Ryan ... except there was no shooting from the beaches (the Japanese had not fortified the shore and had instead set up defenses inland). We see the vomiting and the kissing of crosses and so on.  You either like that kind of thing or you don't, I guess.  It's atmospheric, certainly.

Bad news about the series? ... that is, the episode?  Not too much comes to mind.  It looks like we are going to have more contact between the Marine characters and the home front than we saw between paratroopers and the folks at home in BofB.  Unless that ""meanwhile, back 'Stateside"" material is compelling, I can live without it.  I missed having boot camp sequences for the Robert Leckie character ... perhaps later in the series, when the Eugene Sledge character finally gets into uniform (he has a heart murmur in this one, and weeps because it will prevent him from enlisting in the Marines), we'll see some action with drill instructors and such.  I seem to recall that Sledge wrote good chapters about that in his book.

Also, I caught snatches of dialogue that seem contemporary, not 1940s ... for example, a once-bellicose captain flips out and cowers in a ditch and a passing Marine observes, ""He's lost it.""  ""To lose it"" seems to me to be a recent coinage ... I think a WWII-era Marine would say, ""He's snapping in for a survey,"" according to William Manchester's famous WWII memoir.  I can't recall other passages, but there were at least 3-4 moments when I felt jarred by comments that didn't seem authentic to the era.  It would not seem to be difficult to ask a WWII vet how he would say such-and-such a line from the script, and revise accordingly.

I look forward to Ep. 2 and the series as a whole.  Depending on what kind of special features are part of the DVD package, I predict that unless Ep. 1 alone is good, and the rest of The Pacific is not, I will buy the miniseries DVD as a companion to the BofB boxed set that is on my shelf.",1268611200,31,8454,4.6033333333333335

1086147,5,6305837325,"Tom Hanks came to Cleveland earlier this month and gave a presentation on non-fiction in film, and it included a sneak peek of a scene from ""The Pacific.""  He showed an amazing clip from the upcoming HBO miniseries, and it was truly stunning.  People say the opening scene in ""Saving Private Ryan"" is unforgetable, which is true, but I can definitively say that the scene we saw from ""The Pacific"" has all that drama and perhaps more.  My heart was pounding watching the young men take the beach.  I instantly cared about these Marines, there was a true connection to them -- the acting is superb.  I didn't think it possible that ""Band of Brothers"" could be topped, but I'm telling you, if the scene we saw is any indication, ""The Pacific"" is going to go gangbusters.

This DVD has two separate soundtracks - one with music and natural sounds... and the other with NATURAL SOUNDS OF THE OCEAN ONLY!(The other reviewer might need to learn how to use his DVD player...it even says so right on the box!) Personally I prefer the beautiful acoustic guitar and piano music mixed with the natural sounds the best. But sometimes, I just play the DVD with the sounds of the ocean only. It's very relaxing that way. I found the vivid color, excellent quality, and gentle slow motion to really add to the overall sensual impression of the Pacific Ocean that this wonderful DVD evokes.

The one thing that seemed rather odd was the ones who served in the Pacific tended not to talk about it like the ones who served in Europe.  When you would ask they would say things like ""it was war"" and when you pressed them they said things like ""it wasn't good"".  My Dad, who served in Europe, told me that Europe was like any other European war.  Both sides knew how it was conducted and mostly stuck to the rules.  He said the Pacific was different because the Japanese followed the Asian rules of war which were fairly simple - there are no rules.  He said it was like comparing a boxing match to a street fight and men are capable of some rather frightening things.

If memory serves, in the worst period of the battle for Guadalcanal, the Marine commander called for sailors to volunteer for the hellish front line.
Putting aside all the service gamesmanship, Marine officers knew full well sailors had no effective ground combat training. So the need was desperate.

Despite this, at least two black American Navy cooks stepped forward. Chesty then remarked from this day forward the only color of Marines is green. These are the stories Black History Month exists to rediscover. What happened to these brave Americans?

(Progressive zombie will not understand the place of Chesty with our Marines. A classically epic hero like Achilles and Odysseus rolled together. But with superior Marine attitude)

Real Civil Rights leaders with carefully reasoned Double Victory strategy. Which is why post WWII Majestic Civil Rights was so fruitful. Until it was subsumed by progressive ethno-collectivism.

I hope the teams which crafted Brothers in Arms and The Pacific will attempt to tell a black American story before all the heroes are gone Hollywood has only proved it is unworthy. The hour is late and the time is short to record and preserve our heroes stories first person.

1086777,4,6305837325,"Billed as a companion piece to Band of Brothers, The Pacific is much different. Whereas Band of Brothers told the story of Easy Company, The Pacific really follows 3 main individuals (Leckie, Basilone, and Sledge).
And while Band of Brothers left you with a feeling of hope or optimism, the Pacific was downright dreary and depressing. But that's the true nature of war--it ruins lives. That's not to say Band of Brothers gave a cheery account of war, only that The Pacific portrayed the utter misery that our men experienced in the PTO. So don't watch this series expecting an uplifting experience.
I've watched Band of Brothers several times; I doubt I'll rewatch The Pacific simply because it was so grueling. It'd be like watching Schindler's List over and over.

Another difference is that Band of Brothers had interviews with the veterans themselves throughout the series. The Pacific has none of that (obviously, most of the individuals portrayed in this series were gone by the time production started). Band of Brothers also had narration throughout, through the eyes of one of the men.

It was replete with bizarre scenes of limbs being blown off and blood squirting from wounds that would only be possible with a blood pressure of at least 200/150. Last, but not least, was the characterizations of Sledge walking around in a zombie-like stupor and Snafu as an unemotional psychopath.

1086946,4,6305837325,"Not much point in writing a review for something that already has over 16k, but what the heck. The series is another beautiful film about WW2 in the style of 'Band of Brothers'. However, it falls short of that epic series in several departments. One are the characters. Instead of men in the same unit, the show follows three different men who have little or no contact with each other. One is the intellectual that gives good insights, one is a traditional leader that motivates men and leads by example, and the last is a fragile young man who gets a doctor to look past his inherent physical problems (heart condition?) to let him join the USMC. He later becomes the stereotypical hardened soldier, later succumbing to trauma. Most wrote books about their experiences from which much of the material is drawn. The cinematography is stunning at times, highlighting the beaches of Pacific islands as well as the horror of Japanese defenses and the profound gore of combat. The action and CGI is top notch, on par with SPR and BoB (which share much of the same filming crew). I found most of the characters to be either unlikable, unremarkable, or simply boring. I didn't care about their dates in Australia or while in hospitals or with civilians (which makes up a large fraction of the series); I wanted to see them at the front, forming bonds like Marines do. The combat scenes could have been directed better. The ending is disappointing. Instead of a comprehensive wrap-up to an epic journey, we get many unresolved traumas and issues that leave us hanging. Another big piece keeping this from becoming a five star series is the lack of actual veterans, ala BoB. Hearing them actually speak about their experiences increased the realism and intensity x10. Unfortunately, 'Pacific' had none of that. Still, a must-see series for anyone remotely interested in WW2, especially the war vs Japan. A few good actors can be spotted early in their careers. including Jon Bernthal (The Punisher, Fury, The Walking Dead), and Rami Malik (Mr Robot, Buster's Mal Heart).",1508198400,,2063,4.847025495750708

Using the 10 point mandatory boxing scoring, I give Band of Brothers a 10 and The Pacific an 8. The in-the-trench warfare is disruptive and jarring and appropriately tense but the characters fall flat.

The beauty of Band of Brothers is that you actually care about the characters - The Pacific never establishes that any of the main characters are even likable - especially Leckie who dominates the first 7 episodes. The Sledge character is only slightly better developed. Basilone is the other main character who you really don't care what happens to him. And the Leckie side story (drunk and obnoxious but still ends up with a beautiful and striking lady whose parents don't mind in the least when he throttles her repeatedly) is completely unbelievable.

I personally have watched it over 5 times.
I don't know how they captured the times of the war and the great men who served.
They are:  ""The Greatest Generation"". Never forget them. We owe them everything.

1087074,1,6305837325,"I have to be honest: The Pacific doesn't even deserve to be compared to Band of Brothers - except to demonstrate how good the latter really was.

The problem with The Pacific is the flimsy and lacking character development, itself exacerbated by the disjointed story arcs resulting from the main characters being completely unrelated. The haphazard cutting and chopping in a poor attempt to weave the arcs together doesn't help. I never connected with the main characters, found almost all of the supporting cast utterly unmemorable, and for the most part found the acting emotionally flat if not downright poor.

That's probably why I found the gore (and there's a ton of it) gratuitous and over-the-top. Because the series failed to make me care about the characters, I didn't care about how the gore affected the characters. So the gore simply became clinical and trite, and especially since it is repeated so often through the series, completely unnecessary. (And the reality is that the body count is totally over-the-top; if you don't believe, even Sterling Mace - who served in Eugene Sledge's company and has written an autobio, done many interviews and even a Reddit AMA - has said it was unnecessarily exaggerated in The Pacific.)

As a side note, it is absolutely crazy that the Battle of Iwo Jima gets barely a cameo in the series. It is one of the most historic moments for the Marine Corps, yet in The Pacific it is shoehorned into an episode that is otherwise a fluffy soap opera four times as long. I also feel embarrassed about the representation of John Basiglione - he was awarded a Navy Cross for his heroism at Iwo Jima, but you'd hardly know it from the rushed segment in The Pacific.

Band of Brothers had a much better story arc where the passage of time was represented well and this contributed to the epic feeling of Easy Company's journey from boot camp until the end of WW2. Additionally, the character development in Band of Brothers was incredibly well done especially given it was an ensemble cast, and this emphasized not only the camaraderie, but also the toll of war on the individual. Not a bit of this came across in The Pacific, and I found myself spending most of the series hoping it would quickly end and not really caring what happened to the main characters.

The simple reality is that The Pacific is 9 hours of my life I wish I had back.",1504224000,,2382,4.688995215311005

But the unfolding drama was too much for me to absorb in one evening and in fact I did not finish until about 10 days later. I had to reconcile with being a fact of history, not ""just a movie"" and that this is a collection of true memories. That was difficult to place into my psychological space and caused many a pause until I could  continue watching. The realism was convincing. Two US wars, two enemies, a tremendous toll upon human life. Horrible. But then, it is rightfully said that freedom is not free.

1087259,3,6305837325,I agree with others that Amazon has destroyed the opening of each episode by leaving off the historical footage and interviews with the brave veterans who took part in the action.

Then AMAZON to the rescue with the complete series for a cost less than a month of HBO. To me, it was worth more than the original cost. An excellent history lesson.

After that, the marginal return of each successive episode rapidly declines, and one tires of seeing arms and legs ripped from their bodies. There is some character development, as we see a series of fresh young men transformed into hardened soldiers, some of whom break under the relentless pressure of battle.

It started out with promise, seemingly a documentary-style show like Band of Brothers, which I enjoyed very much and learned a lot about WWII from. Within three episodes however, The Pacific lost its focus on WWII and began concentrating on the dysfunction of the main characters. It seems disjointed. The episodes do not flow together, one into the other very well. In Band of Brothers I became interested in the individual soldiers and how as individuals they impacted and were impacted by the war. Not so much with The Pacific. I will finish The Pacific, and since I'm only at episode 4 it may get more interesting to me.",1486166400,,671,4.743589743589744

I already knew much about the Pacific war from an early age due to the experiences of my father and several uncles as well as many of my neighbors. This production made me dig deeper into what I knew. Seeing historical figures portrayed by young men brought events into a sudden, and startling reality as I was able to now see men i knew who until that time resided atop  the events now were struggling to comprehend and endure without the assurance they would live to tell anyone about it.

1088901,4,6305837325,"The Pacific miniseries offers a unique ""ground up"" perspective of the most tumultuous period in human history. There is just enough character building to keep the viewer interested even when the GI's are on leave. As for the battle scenes, whether the film exploits the blood and gore aspect is arguable but it certainly doesn't shirk that reality. Periodically, the film seems to be on the precipice of Spielberg-ish sensationalism but thankfully pulls back just in time. One other fact I couldn't help noticing is that, beyond purely Japanese Asians and American and Australian Caucasians, no other race is represented in all 10 segments which, beyond all politically correct considerations, would not be historically accurate.",1485907200,,729,5.3478260869565215

Although it falls short of the debt we owe our veterans and active service men/women, it delivers on the intention of giving a realistic account and will evoke in viewers feelings of gratitude, patriotism and sympathy.  Every day we enjoy our freedom and the luxury of our society should include thanks to the men and women who serve our country and who sacrifice(d) themselves.  Although their injury and loss is heartbreaking, their families should take comfort in the pride of knowing their sons and daughters are heroes and that there are people who appreciate deeply what they have given in service to their country.

I am always grateful for what they did back then for their sacrifice. Even joining the USMC myself and serving in Afghanistan I still thank those men from WW2 because for what any man who has sacrificed that much and suffered doing what they did. All those who served in the front lines are what help defeat the bad guys and stop the Germans and Japaneses from wining.

More about the day to day life in extremely difficult circumstances and less about the actual fighting, which from my point of view is alright. The attitudes of the soldiers is interesting, I'm not sure how revisionist that is, and it is the area where I am less inclined to give this a higher rating. Not being alive during the time I can't say for certain, but there is a lot of negativity among the troops and a: that is not the way I've typically seen this war portrayed and b: if that was truly the way the soldiers dealt with the conditions one wonders whether the fight might not have been knocked out of them long before they even got to the big battles.

If they can make a spot in the show for sex scenes, they could have added a few scenes with some of the music that was so popular, or how families were effected, or how the locals helped or hindered....something besides bodies being blown up.

1091842,3,6305837325,"Overall, this series has tried to give the watcher a fairly realistic feel for the various battles. I think they succeeded very well in that. However, the story line bounces through several different parallel story lines, which after awhile causes you to get lost as to who is who and what was it, in earlier episodes, that was told about the character. I don't know if it would have been better to follow one character at a time through the war, rather than following each character concurrently within the timeline of the war years. So, because of that, I did not become at all invested emotionally with any one character. When a character was killed, I just didn't have enough time with them from the series to feel anything. Rather than watch the program, locate the audio CD's of the book that the series was based on. I listened to it several years ago and found it far more compelling and engaging than this TV series.",1483401600,,925,4.578313253012048

You say there's too much nudity? Yet you're okay with seeing heads and limbs and blood everywhere? Makes sense. Say it was dragged out too long and boring? Oh okay, the constant war scenes weren't glamorous and prideful enough? This film portrayed war times better than band of brothers did. It is dark, terrible and complete hell. Soldiers would hook up with local girls in town , do you blame them? Life is on the line, don't know when they'll die. It's like you're all expecting a G rated teeny bop war movie. Get real.

I'm always amazed when people are so shocked by some as beautiful as young love lust but, don't talk about snafu pulling gold teeth and tossing pebbles into the blown apart Japanese shoulders head.

I was young when they came home, but still remember like it was yesterday.  I know they both saw plenty of action, but this series gave me a greater appreciation for their, and all the others, sacrifices.  I also think the Japanese soldiers were depicted fairly.  Even  though they were our enemy at the time, you have to give the Japanese plenty of credit for their tenacity against overwhelming odds. This is a series you don't want to miss.  It appears to be historically accurate & does  the best job I have seen of depicting the horrors of being on the line.  It also does a good job of showing the costs of war.  Great character development as young men quickly age in a terrible environment. Watched it twice.  Five stars from me.",1483315200,,912,4.427710843373494

Other war epics you can watch and feel little about what you are watching. This has you seeing through the eyes of Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie from their writings as well as the documented history of John Basilone. I think they should show this and The Band of Brothers in schools so the youth could better appreciate the sacrifices made by solders in a brutal war.,1483315200,,528,4.627659574468085

Still we must understand as an old proverb says, ""You can only live at peace with your neighbor so long as your neighbor wants to live at peace with you.""  When our neighbor will not allow us to live at peace we must be willing and able to defend ourselves.  The cost is high and those who step up willingly and take on that task deserve our greatest gratitude.  This is well worth your time to watch and learn.",1483142400,,622,4.133333333333334

1092288,4,6305837325,The unfortunate side of Saving Private Ryan and Band of Borthers was that they were epic and set an almost impossible bar for any following movie. I like the series but it wanders sometimes. The scenes are every part realistic and historic. I have to remember the scope and that covering the whole Pacific campaign would be a huge series rather than a few episodes. One thing I missed from Band of Brothers was the few opening minutes having an interview with someone who was actually there. It added a lot of weight to the following episodes.  In all still a good series.,1483142400,,572,4.553398058252427

1092597,4,6305837325,"I think Band of Brothers was a better series.  This is a story of actual people, so you really cannot critique the story other than how it is told or shown.  I learned of these battles in school, but these personal stories take you there, but for some reason it took me a long time to care for the main characters and I really never got attached to the secondary character, as I did in Band of Brothers.  The best episode was the part in Australia after Guadal Canal; total gut punch when Leikle (sp?) goes to meet the Greek girlfriend and she tells him never to return.  I was so hoping he'd return to her after the war and prove her wrong, but you knew deep down he'd hook up with the girl from the first episode back home.  Later, I read about the real life characters before finishing the series, so it kind of spoiled it for me when I knew what was coming for Leikle, Basilone, and Sledge.  They should've ended the series on a more positive note for Sledge, as he does go onto to get married and become a professor in biology.  The bird hunting scene was good but incomplete; his father introduced him to photography as a means of maintaining his hunting tradition and would've been a good lead up to him studying biology.",1482883200,2,1228,4.3130434782608695

1092940,5,6305837325,"Being an inactive Marine (never ex), I found the series to be true to what really happens in conflict. There is nothing romantic or cuddly about man killing man.

1093051,4,6305837325,"The story is beautifully crafted, however it is disjointed and there were about four times in the story in which I had to try to figure out who I was watching, where the character had been introduced. Band of Brothers was more coherent, Pacific was deeply disturbing when you realize every combat action for these marines was essentially an airborne drop, there was no maneuver or outsmarting the enemy, it was blind fortune for every step they made. I am a Marine. I love the portrayal of the Marines in this story. This is a fantastic story. Band of Brothers is closer to perfect.

1093167,3,6305837325,"I'm half through the series and this definitely comes up short compared to the Band of Brothers series.  Every battle scene has been filled with several angle cuts in rapid succession that I thought I was going to have a seizure, let alone comprehend what I was watching in the night scenes.  Story lines were okay, but BOB drew you in more.  They sissied it up with some love stories, which probably happened a lot when on leave, so can't knock it too much.  I did enjoy learning a little more about the Pacific front of WWII, which might just lend itself to not be as great of a story to tell as the European war front was.  I would say it's worth watching once, but don't expect a copy of Band of Brothers.",1482278400,,709,4.2611940298507465

Realistic, factual, patriotic, sad, and a tribute to all the men and women who gave their efforts and lives to that war--the one that came after the War to End All Wars.  All wars are horrific.  There are people who have not even been born yet who will die in a war.  There never has been a war to end all wars and so war will continue until there is no more humanity.  But this war was different in so many respects from all others and this HBO series that speaks only to the Pacific theater projects that rarity of sacrifice and unity--until the war was over--and life goes on.  Yet, those who fought in the trenches established a brotherhood and a grit so true  that it is almost enviable, except to possess it you'd have to go through hell and back.  The writing was stupendous, the actors were perfect and the directing was beautiful.  The special effects unbelievably realistic!  I binge watched it in its entirety in one day.

1094639,5,6305837325,This series does a much better job of portraying the horror that was the Pacific Theatre than the majority of movies that cover the same theme.

Battle scenes seem to be gratuitous as opposed to ""Band"" which wove the battle scenes into the storyline. Unlike ""Band"", this series assumes the viewer is familiar with the war in the Pacific and doesn't do anything to setup the episode other than showing a map with place names.

The story outside of brief scenes of battles did little to enlighten you as to who these men were and what they were going through.

1095105,4,6305837325,Great WWII Story...probably the most untold side of the WWII is the battle against the Japanese Empire... War scenes put you in the middle of battle and provided insight as to what might have been going through a soldier's head at the time.

Full Disclosure: my father-in-law was in the 381st Bomb Group (triangle L), based in Ridgewell, UK.  His B-17 was the Stage Door Canteen, and he was the radar operator.

Starting before the bombing of Pearl Harbor and spanning through the end of the war, the characters and battles portrayed are based on actual persons and conflicts resolved throughout the course of the war, including a short end-of-credits narrative of what became of some of the main characters.

Touching, tragic, and unreal are words that would describe this series well, but words are not enough to convey the stories told in this production.  Fans of drama, action, history, suspense, and documentary genres will all find value here.",1480032000,,732,4.887096774193548

1097658,5,6305837325,"Near the end of episode 2 there was a scene that I've described to several friends and cannot get through my retelling without becoming emotionally overwhelmed to the point of tears,so poignant was that scene. Great directing and acting certainly made this scene effective, but it was my personal connection to it that makes me well up inside with such enormous pride to know a man with whom I've become close friends who was there...1st Marine Division, Guadalcanal. He is 93( I am 67 same as his deceased son whom I helped care for until Parkinsons Disease took him six years ago, which is how I made this wonderful mans' acquaintance) and without going into detail has told me many times what he experienced there seems like it occurred"" only yesterday"". He wears his white Guadalcanal, New Britain, Gloucester Bay Veterans' hat proudly everywhere he goes.and the scene I'm referring to affixed Guadalcanal in a whole different light for me. To wit: four 1st Marines who'd just gone through several months of living hell taking from the Japanese a stategic airstrip and virtually saving Austaria from invasion were entering the galley of the troop ship taking them off the island for well deserved R&R in Australia. They asked a cooks mate in the otherwise empty galley for a bite to eat to which he said they would have to wait till a certain time but served them coffee they requested. As they sat savoring the most delicious tasting thing as shown by their expressions that they had probably had in months, the cooks' mate stood by and asked tentatvely, ""Was it as bad as they say it was?"" The four, two on each side of the trestle table, remained silent intent on savoring their coffee -until this remark seemed to stir something between them and as the mate walked away believing he may have hit a nerve he should let well enough alone, one of the marines stopped him with a question, "" Who are 'they'?"" His response stunned them for they thought they had just gone through their own anonymous private hell . ""Well everyone knows about Guadalcanal"", the cook said somewhat incredulously. ""Ist Marines on Guadalcanal are on the front page of every newspaper in the country. You guys are heroes back home."" Mister Eugene Hamilton, 1st Marine Division, Guadalcanal, I am so proud to know you.",1478822400,,2297,4.7593984962406015

1098382,3,6305837325,"A viewer is immediately expecting a Pacific version of the war in Europe featured in Band of Brothers.  The marine-versus-army views are well played but The Pacific falls short of Band of Brothers in most ways -- acting, story, pacing, and inspiration.  The views of combat are so bleak it is almost welcome that the series spends much of its time off the battlefield, but still on fraught issues.  Even so, the combat portions are the most engaging and inspiring parts.  As with Band of Brothers, one gets the idea that honoring the men who fought was a central theme.  It is just sad that the individual stories chosen were so unbalanced toward the dreary side.  The best of them was that of medal of honor winner Sgt. John Basilone, who tragically died as a true hero in his return to service after selling war bonds .  He was the only main character with a story that invited you inside, and had facets that reflected interesting aspects of the war.  The rest of the stories followed distant and closed-up men; probably true to history but not compelling story-telling.  There was no light on the Japanese view of the war, although their depiction as a formidable and mysterious force was masterful.",1478390400,,1203,4.690476190476191

I think what 'we', that is the American Boys, went through in the Pacific is nearly forgotten today as most WWII movies and TV shows deal with Europe and Germany and the Nazis.  I find my interest is in the Pacific and the war with Japan.  The war was ended by the use of the Atom Bombs on Japan, but it was won by these truly horrific battles on little Islands we still know nearly nothing about.

For one who has never been in combat or had a father or brother or even sister or mother who had never experienced combat, this program awakens you to the horrors of war. There is a scene of Eugene and his nightmares at home that affected me as I can remember my father's nightmares as a child.

1098941,2,6305837325,"Series was way too long and repetitive, and had too much gratuitous sex. The horrible fighting scenes got to be too much after a while, even though they were realistic. But one got the point after a few of them. And if you're going to show real USMC fighting, show more about Iwo Jima -- one of the most terrible campaigns of WWII, and possibly the most significant battle in the MC's entire history, with a horrendous casualty rate. In this series, Iwo Jima got only a small segment, whereas much more time was spent on lesser battles. Overall, this show was very much inferior to A Band of Brothers that traced the experiences of the 101st Airborne in the European campaign.",1478044800,,676,4.549180327868853

The down time, before or after a battle, around camp or out in the field, waiting for orders, is hard, dirty or muddy, with even the small tasks, like opening a can of food or going to the bathroom, are shown for what they are... a real pain.

WWII is usually shown in movies in the John Wayne tradition of mostly victorious battles and maybe a little dirt on the otherwise nicely pressed uniforms.

The Pacific goes the great lengths to give the viewer a true experience of what took place on a daily basis for these soldiers.",1477958400,,648,4.420168067226891

The Pacific was Tom Hanks answer to ""Band of Brothers"" which he also produced. with The Pacific covering the war with Japan & Band of Brothers covering the war in Europe.

1100297,3,6305837325,"Way more sex than is necessary to tell a story.  Also, the scenes of marines having fits of conscience over Japanese casualties seems overplayed.  The scene of a Japanese soldier suffering anguish and rage after a failed banzai charge seems incongruous for Guadalcanal, since at that stage of the war, the Japanese Imperial Army was far from throwing in the towel, and the combat troops on Guadalcanal were seasoned veterans who were part of the conquering army which had overrun half of Asia, not a desperate home guard.  I don't understand the why the director gave the character this strange motivation.  If a Japanese soldier of the Ichiki Infantry Regiment was angry at anyone, it would have been his commander, who led his 917 soldiers into annihilation.  Also, it would have been greet to include a scene of the marines loading their own ships in Wellington New Zealand because of the strike by the communist dock worker's union there.  The work stoppage meant supplies ran short on GuadalcanaI.  How about a scene where a G.I. runs out of ammo because some Kiwi commie scumbag stayed home, and the anger of the rest of the squad at the injustice?  Instead we get scenes of Americans getting drunk and being generally obnoxious.  I guess it all depends on the director's personal values.  I for one, would have preferred to see more of the ""whats"" and ""whens"" and ""wheres"" and the ""how we won"" of The Pacific than another rip on Uncle Sam.  The combat scenes in this movie are first-rate.",1477267200,3,1495,4.755813953488372

1100782,4,6305837325,"After watching this series, I came away with a greater appreciation for what those Marines went through in the Pacific.  Although the war in Europe was awful for those who served, I think the Marines in the Pacific faced a greater challenge as their enemies were fanatics and did not follow standard rules of war and conduct.  While the action scenes were realistic and I enjoyed the focus on the men during their time in the war zone, the one episode devoted to Sgt. Basilone's time back in the states was dull.  The final episode focusing on the troops finally returning home to a ""normal"" life was very well done",1476921600,,615,4.572727272727272

As a Marine, Patriot and history lover it was great to see a series about my branch of service and by far the greatest generation of Americans. The only reason I gave it a 4 star and not a 5 was that it had a love story involved. Band of Brothers was an awesome series, I liked how they did interviews with the actual people some of the characters were portrayed after.  I know when this was filmed many in this series were already passed, but it would have been great if they could have Chesty Puller and or John Basilone in the commentary.",1476921600,,583,4.205357142857143

Spielberg and Hanks were both heavily involved, and so there are some similarities as far as the filming and set up goes. However, this is a complete departure from BoB story wise.

Tried to watch 3 shows on Amazon Prime streaming and have to turn the TV up to 100 and still can't hear voices.  I can't turn my volume on normal TV past 50 without it being too loud so it isn't the TV.  I read online a lot of people complaining about the same low volume thing yet AMAZON does not address this issue ... If there is a special setting it would be nice if they would tell AMAZON Prime users so they could enjoy the service because as of now it is worthless to me to try and view a movie ...

Both series truly make me appreciate the sacrifices our previous generation made to secure the freedom of our country and the world.

1101569,5,6305837325,"Tom Hanks and Spielberg hit it out of the park again with another fantastic homage to the heroes and experiences of WW2. It's worth noting that even though it's a WW2 drama, it's different from Band of Brothers in almost every way possible. Band of Brothers, in my mind, is a celebration of the brotherhood and courage of Easy Company 101st Airborne. It gives a glimpse into the heroism and resolve of the soldiers who endured some of the worst that the American forces faced in the war in Europe from DDay, Carentan, Market Garden, Bastogne, and a few other key engagements.

The Pacific continues the trend of a character driven narrative with high production value but tells a much darker and more abysmal story of the horrors that the 1st Marines faced at Guadalcanal, Peleleiu, Okinawa, and Iwo Jima. The supporting cast is rather large, though the main focus of this series is on 3 particular individuals; Bob Leckie, John Basalone, and Eugene Sledge - the material for most of the series was taken from Bob Leckie's autobiography ""Helmet for my Pillow"" and Eugene Sledge's autobiography ""With the Old Breed: at Peleliu and Okinawa"". While there are some scenes which visually romanticize the American vision of the rugged bare-chested marine fighting the ""Japs"" in the pacific - the charm is quickly overshadowed by the horrors of the non-conventional warfare our marines faced in the Pacific theatre. The Japanese warriors who engaged in night attacks, banzai bayonet charges, and suicide attacks are portrayed in a very dark and terrifying manner that definitely does justice to the brutality of the combat which took place. While Hollywood typically demonizes America's enemies in these sorts of features - the writers did a good job of respecting the Japanese as people and giving an accurate portrayal of the motivations of combatants on both sides of the conflict.

What this series does that Band of Brothers didn't is show the difficulties of the soldiers who returned from the war and the mental toll that the war in the Pacific took on them. There are some scenes that are real tear-jerkers, having felt especially bonded to the characters and their experiences.

While I think I prefer Band of Brothers if I had to pick a favorite, I still greatly admire The Pacific as a spectacle that stands on its own. It shares a very different story than Band of Brothers and I would highly recommend.

Note: This series is especially violent and gratuitous in its portrayal of many of the themes of the war in the pacific. Everything from the violence, the language, and the sexual content is quite R-rated so this might not be the most appropriate for younger audiences.",1476230400,103,2679,4.881318681318682

In Western democracies, we view WW II as a glorious war against fascism and tyranny. But, war is never glorious. It is always worse than anything anyone who hasn't been there can imagine. Of course, sometimes, fighting is necessary as it was in WW II. Still, docudramas like this The Pacific help all of us remember the true reality that unfolds as bullets, mortars, and bombs rip through flesh and countless young lives end before they have a chance to bloom.

Character development is slow at first but then by the third installment one is getting a feel for the main players and their individual struggles.  By the end of the series I was fully invested in their fates.  It was hard to watch some of what they had to go through, and I feel nothing but respect and astonishment for the courage and fortitude of those who endured what this series so brilliantly depicts.  On a technical note, the series in my opinion appears unrelentingly accurate and detail-oriented on the dress, equipment, mannerisms, tactics, etc., of that era, in a way that few other war movies have been.  Also as others have said, this series sheds well-deserved light on some campaigns and battles of the War in the Pacific (Guadalcanal, Peleliu, Okinawa) that until this series, had not received their cinematic due.  Also, in a way few other World War II movies or dramas have, this series shows the cost of war psychologically to those we ask to wage it.",1475798400,,1130,4.6767676767676765

Some of the horrors the soldiers went through during the war can only be comprehend by anyone if you were there.  I always believe it is the actors that make a C movie into a B movie.  The ""Red Thine Line"" has very good cast of characters and the portrait of movie individuals  was very good.

1102354,1,6305837325,"Each of these Marines did what they were trained to do.  From a Hollywood movie/entertainment standpoint, a good movie.  From a reality standpoint, hell no!  It seems like these writers made these soldiers to look like monsters and what we did to the Japanese was wrong.  I have a family member who survived Bataan and the death march. I have heard the stories from him and read the books he was quoted in.  What the Japanese did to not only the Americans, but the Phillipinos and the Chinese was horrific and gruesome.  The point of war is to kill the enemy to make them stop their actions. Nobody likes war, but sometimes it is necessary.  I feel like this movie villifies this part of WWII.  Folks, do these soldiers the honor of reading their own combat memoirs.  This is the best way to honor their service and their memories.",1475020800,,831,4.523489932885906

Lost his two sons to  disease at home, while he was away. He came home to my grandmother and three little girls. He had problems with alcohol and anger issues for twenty years until he turned his life around. I know he was on numerous islands,but all he would ever say is that he ""steamed endlessly to every god forsaken rock sticking out of the water""

We see young man dash of to war to avenge the atrocities committed by the Japanese army on Pearl Harbor. We see the transformation they go through as they battle from one island to the next. Characters are wonderfully complex and enough time is giving to their emotional development.

1102771,3,6305837325,"The Pacific follows in the footsteps of Band of Brothers but takes a look at the war on the Pacific front and what they had to endure. Basically, it was the same war but very different circumstances with a very different enemy. The Pacific was good but had a much darker take on what the soldiers went through and the PTSD that followed. Instead of stopping with everyone being a hero like BoB, The Pacific ends with the real struggles they faced at home. It's a lot more intense and darker than BoB so it's not going to be for everyone. Personally, I thought it was okay but did not live up to the epic style of BoB. If you had to pick between the two, I would go with BoB but the Pacific is worth a view as well.",1474588800,,714,4.107142857142857

1103035,5,6305837325,"The Pacific is a 2010 television series produced by HBO, Playtone and DreamWorks that premiered on March 14, 2010.
The series is a companion piece to the 2001 miniseries Band of Brothers and focuses on the United States Marine Corps' actions in the Pacific Theater of Operations  within the wider Pacific War.

Whereas Band of Brothers followed the men of Easy Company  of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment through the European Theater, The Pacific centers on the experiences of three Marines (Eugene Sledge, Robert Leckie and Medal of Honor recipient John Basilone)  who were all in different regiments of the 1st Marine Division.
It features the 1st Marine Division's battles in the Pacific, such as Guadalcanal, Cape Gloucester, Peleliu, and Okinawa, as well as Basilone's involvement in the Battle of Iwo Jima.
 It's based primarily on the memoirs of two U.S. Marines: With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa by Eugene Sledge; and Helmet for My Pillow by Robert Leckie.[3] It also draws on Sledge's China Marine[4] and Red Blood, Black Sand, the memoir of Chuck Tatum, a Marine who fought alongside Basilone on Iwo Jima.

Like Band of Brothers, this 10-part mini series focuses on real, actual people who served in the war.
If you enjoyed B of B, you're in for a treat.  This beautifully produced, amazing piece of television history must not be missed.  I gave this five stars, but it deserves ten.",1474329600,2,1410,4.919831223628692

A bonus for me is the beautiful diversity of people in the series. Unlike Band Of Brothers which was exclusively white male. Every war from the dawn of time had people of color and women involved. Our modern media, in all forms, should and must honestly and accurately portray this fact.

""I forgot the war. My battle was with myself. My battle was with this environment. My battle was to stay sane. I heard men talking about how they prayed for death everyday 'cause nothing could be as bad as being there. The enemy for us was the jungle, weather, the mud. I woke up everyday and prayed, 'please let it be the day I get shot.'""

""I think the war changed me quite a bit, maybe for the better. It has disciplined us. We were humbled by...and for the rest of your life you'd appreciate for a clean glass of water, you'd appreciate clean sheets, you'd appreciate good food. I've had a wonderful life; I really have.""

But it falls into the politically correct ditch of portraying soldiers as sad, disillusioned and mentally unstable. Certainly war is a brutal and punishing experience. But there is also patriotism, and religious devotion in those trenches that we hear about from other sources. Little of that is portrayed, except to show it in an unflattering way. I never fought, and I may be wrong, but this series seems to have more in common with what is popular in Hollywood, than what I have heard from other accounts.

After finishing the book I decided to watch this. I highly recommend the book! This series was extremely well done and spot-on with Sledge's book. But he was much more of a gentleman and used terms like ""fouled- up"" instead of the F word, which I greatly appreciated. Did they really say the F word that much in the WW2 era? My mother who is 83 says no. But hey, she wasn't a soldier. Who knows? It was so often used that I felt uncomfortable letting my teenage sons watch it with me, so they didn't. Wish they could've.

The Pacific theater of World War II doesn't receive much coverage, and this was very educational. Like ""Band of Brothers,"" this is also based on true battles and true people.  One of the major differences is that it covers essentially three main people, whereas ""Band of Brothers"" had a large ensemble cast whose names you knew.  With that series, you knew 15 to 20 characters by the end.  I especially appreciated how they used the last episode to cover the lives of those who came back from the Pacific after the war, and what adjusting to regular life for them was like.

1104452,5,6305837325,"I never knew my father.  In April, 1945,  he was killed on a ship in the Pacific when it was hit by a Japanese suicide plane.  I have often wondered what went through his mind during the battle.  Although he was at sea and the men portrayed in The Pacific were on land, all of them must have fought with the knowledge that their lives could be ended at any moment.  Any person who can go through something like that certainly gets my highest respect.  I really don't know if I ever could do it but I guess no one knows what he is capable of until .he is placed in a situation where it is kill or be killed.  At any rate, it is certain after an experience like that, your life will never be the same.
The Pacific is a well crafted series that so realistically portrays men doing things to each other that no human being should have to do or experience.  In the series, I met many naive young men who eagerly jumped on the bandwagon as if it would be one big party, watched as  they changed when reality hit, and cried as many were cut down by enemy fire.  For me, it was a gut-wrenching experience.  These events really happened and the fact that the taking of a human life can become so commonplace scares the hell out of me.

We binge watched a bit, and at times the war scenes became so intense that I had to take a break. But that's kind of the point, isn't it? This war was brutal and we should never forget that, nor its impact on the brave men, women, families, and communities who experienced this war in one way or another.

Felt like it ended abruptly, but only because I didn't want the story to end so soon after the end of the war! In actuality, the series covered what it set out to cover. Loved it - highly recommended.",1472774400,,633,4.592920353982301

WW11. This film, though quite dark and granney in places, is a superior work in replicating combat. For others with a similar background, I believe the statement ""I could smell the cordite"" communicates how accurately this film represents the most horrific of combat.

But no matter what service your in you have to be able to look at these guys and say they are my brothers of old. Because of them we can live how we do today. Because they didn't give up despite the horrors and unimaginable conditions. Hardly anyone knows the story of men in the Pacific. Everything focuses on the European aspect of ww2. Every story shows a hero and makes war seem full of glory. Not this. This is the good the bad and the terrible. I'm am so glad these men stories were told. I write with tears in my eyes because it was an emotional ride and I have so much gratitude for the brave men and women before me and for the directors and film makers who were able to present this to me. I look at life different now. I have more pride to serve now. Even more so that I'm in stationed Hawaii, the Pacific theater. I really feel like every American should see this. And even if they don't remember it 5 years after seeing it...just for a moment at least they can think about those who gave their all out their in the Pacific.

A barbaric theater of war that The Pacific does a fair job of hinting at the extremes of the barbarity our soldiers endured.  Wonderful characters and believable in their actions and circumstances.  Sgt Leckie struck up an instant romance in Australia but the girl made the case that she would not risk pregnancy and heartbreak for a likely fleeting romance even if her mother was praying for his return to them.  She reasonably doubted that circumstances would make it likely but the character, Leckie, could be believed to be the exception because the viewer knows him much better than the girl.

  A. One of the ""Marines"" refers to the 4th. Mar. Div. as the ""4th Marines.""  No Marine would say that.  ""4th. Marines"" refers (only) to the 4th. Infantry regiment.

  B. Weapons:  1. It seemed like a near majority of enlisted men in the show fought the whole war w/ carbines.  The carbine was a piece of junk.  The officers & NCOs who were issued them usually exchanged them for an M1.  Shoot someone w/ an M1 & he would likely go down; Japanese were known to take a surprising number of carbine hits & keep coming.
  2. The near total absence of Browning Automatic Rifles  (BARs) in all that combat.  The Marines loved the BAR; (yes, I know the magazine was a piece of junk and could jam easily) the rate of fire was great.  It was normal procedure in some units to send BAR men (c. 25% of an infantry squad) who became casualties to the rear w/ carbines or M1s & keep the BARs.  I knew of one company on Guadalcanal where almost every man ended up w/ an automatic rifle.  They never became great jungle fighters but they could put out a tremendous rate of return fire.

  C. Finally, the age of the Marines.  I have seen it estimated that the average age of the 11,000 marines who fought on the Canal was 18.  I would guess the average age of the actors was - mid 20's?  OK.  I know it would be hard for the casting people to get a large nr. of teenagers together for their film - but still.  It would have been a lot more authentic.  And they would be the first to do it.",1470787200,4,1731,4.204892966360856

I always pushed him to tell more but he'd always refuse. I never could understand why until I saw these ten episodes. Now I know why he didn't tell more.

These actors did a great job recreating this ""event"" and fortunately I believe they all went back to their lives of luxury and cleanliness every day after the ""day's shoot"". I'm pretty sure they all went home with a big paycheck when they were done filming. Dad? He never wholly got over the war and he never knew from one second to the next while he was serving whether he'd be going home or not... much like those who served with him didn't know.

1107010,5,6305837325,"This series is excellently done by Steven Spielberg and his team.  The action is incredible and often times heartbreaking to see what our men went through in the Pacific.  This series should not be viewed by children under 18 years old as the scenes are often very intense, bloody and there is very strong language.  This series paints a real picture of what a hell the Pacific war theater was for our marines during WWII.

But I think it's the Pacific locale itself that keeps me that stops me.  This is not the glamorous side of WWII.  The European campaign tends to get that treatment.  It's hot, dirty, and full of disease.  EVERYTHING is wet.  A lot of times, it just plain gross.
There are plenty of moments aside from the fighting, and I enjoyed those as well.
There are a few slow motion moments that MIGHT glamourize the fighting, but all in all, this is well done.

1107561,4,6305837325,Not quite as good as Band Of Brothers in my opinion. A few of the episodes make it feel more like a soap opera but still a very well done and shocking view of WWII.

1107606,2,6305837325,"I heard this series was a sort of ""Band of Brothers"" couched in the Pacific Theater of WWII. i was glad to hear someone wanted to tell this often-overlooked story. The Battle sequences are intense and capture the ferocity of the warfare. Unfortunately, the writers (director?) did not do a good job with character development; I simply did not connect emotionally with anyone. My other complaint: rather than allowing the characters to tell their own story, it felt more like a post-modern reinterpretation of the war.

1107700,5,6305837325,"Tom Hanks is a great historian, taking books written by the characters and turning it into a miniseries.  It just reinforces the appreciation I have for the greatest generation who fought in the South Pacific during WWII and the conditions they had to endure to defeat the Japanese. It's graphic, it's sad, happy for those who made it through, yet had to deal with the memories of what they had to do. And tragic for the families of those who didn't make it home and were buried on islands in the Pacific.  Being retired military but not deployed to a war zone in my career, it brought the death, carnage, and what happens a home to light during the war. in that time.  The last episode is the toughest, but it ties the series characters and their real life counterparts. Honestly I was tearing up big time by the end of this series, if you don't turn in your man card!  I recommend this series whole heartedly.

Other than WWII documentaries i don't think i've ever viewed anything so real and graphic concerning the conditions our soldiers dealt with in the Pacific theater. The Actors though little known did a fabulous job in their portrayals and i was stunned at how close the resemblances were to the actual people they played when they showed the photos in the end. I would have to say the the portrayal of Eugene Sledge was fantastic! Joe Mazzello captured the internalized feelings many of our serviceman dealt with at that time.

It is gruesome and raw at times, but the public needs to know the truth about wars and the conditions that regular people had to endure. This epic story brings background insight into the political aspects of major decisions. It also is a love story featuring flighty and enduring relationships. Boys become men and these men have carried a weight their entire life. The sacrifices are hard to fathom and some sacrificed far more than others. High school teachers should sit classes down and force them to see this before they start whining about the line at Starbucks. Finally, the music soundtrack is haunting. Music is a powerful part of this entire production and you can just feel the intensity of young boys looking at a formidable island over the gunnel of a troop ship with the pounding by battleships, the explosions, the ominous days ahead knowing that half would die...dm",1468800000,,968,4.872727272727273

If you are into WWII or history shows, you will like it, but it goes much deeper into the personal lives of these young soldiers and what they were facing.  It is based on the lives of real soldiers and at the end of Episode 10 they show the real soldiers' pictures and what they did after the war.  That was just incredible!  A must see!

1108231,5,6305837325,"Amazing what the Marines of my grandparent's generation were able to go through to protect our country.  Equally amazing what the Japanese soldiers were willing to endure for their country.  Reminds me of how lucky I am to have never had to experience war.

Episode 10 is the kind of show that should be played every single Memorial Day and Veterans Day.  The scene with John Basilone's grieving family was one the saddest, most emotionally eliciting scenes I have seen in a TV series.  The story of Eugene Sledge's return home and uncomfortable assimilation  back into civilian life  is made all the more gut wrenching as we watch him begin his lifelong struggle with PTSD.  The episode is an astonishing reminder that our veterans of all wars have risked so much more than just their physical safety to keep us safe.

Every episode is action packed and emotionally moving.  The soundtrack is amazing, the dialogue is excellent, the combat scenes are breath taking, and the acting is first rate.  Watch this series, you won't regret it.",1468627200,,1037,4.8352272727272725

I also enjoyed the interactions of  the marines and civilians while they were in Australia  This  brought back fond memories of my R&R in Sydney.  This is a well written and acted series.  The music in the beginning and end of each episode is also very moving.

1108574,3,6305837325,As a genre piece in the same line as Band of Brothers this series is very disappointing.  The overall tone of the series is very heavy even for a war piece.  The level of melancholy does a disservice to the WW II Marine fighting man.  It's an easy trap for film makers in the post Apocalypse film world to potray every day as unrelentingly bleak for the soldiers.  Unfortunately this series falls squarely into the trap to the point of making the characters one dimensional.  Its a true disservice to the memory of these fantastic gentlemen and what they did in the Pacific.,1468540800,,574,4.533980582524272
1108595,5,6305837325,"The series was very graphic in places. This added to the realism of what our troops went through fighting from Guadalcanal to Okinawa. These Marines certainly deserve the accolade of ""The Greatest Generation."" Suffering was huge even when they were not fighting. The script and actors and all the others who contributed to this series deserve immense appreciation for telling us an important story about World War II in the Pacific. All of our military services and the civilians at home made winning the war possible, but the Marines and the Navy stand out especially in the horrific battle for Okinawa. There were a few times I had tears in my eyes and other times when I had to take a break from watching because the series was so intense.

It is an epic, soulful, harrowing yet heart-felt depiction of what so many men and women went through in the Pacific during World War II.

1108819,3,6305837325,"I came here from HBO Now after watching the original Band of Brothers mini-series, which was so gripping, so engaging, so wonderful - I simply wasn't ready for it to end. I guess I'd hoped to continue that level of entertainment, you know when you get so lost in what you're watching, all of the cares of your personal reality just seem to slip away into irrelevance? Well, sadly, I didn't get that with The Pacific. First of all let me stress - I DID judge this series on it's own merit. I didn't hit ""play"" expecting it to *be* the original Band of Brothers. I did however have *hopes* which were soundly dashed. With some series you aren't grabbed immediately. I know that. With The Pacific, I kept watching and watching, waiting for that moment where I'd be hooked, and I'd feel myself connect with the characters and what was happening to them would begin to really matter to me - but that moment never came. This series was not well cast, nor well acted, nor well written, nor well filmed. For me it was like watching a Saturday Afternoon Special after The Maltese Falcon. I think the only character I actually enjoyed was Col Lewis B. Chesty  Puller. The rest of them were so inconsequential, which is truly a shame. I know the real men these characters are based on, are true American heroes. I respect them, I care for them, I salute them, and I honor them for their service. This series didn't do their stories justice. Lastly, the romantic interludes were completely unnecessary and annoying. In fact, that may be where they lost me for good. Of course I know the soldiers had romances with the local girls, but seeing a very forward Greek girl climb on top of one of the main characters the first night they were alone together, did absolutely nothing for me. I want to see the harrows of war and the camaraderie between the men, not ""love in the afternoon"".  To me the powers that be really blew it with those scenes.",1468195200,,1930,4.495726495726496

1108879,4,6305837325,Generally a good series (though not nearly as good as Band of Brothers). The Pacific seems to dwell too much on personal relationships between the characters and not enough on the history of the Pacific campaign. Each episode takes the viewer from one battle to another as the Marines island hop throughout the campaign but does a bad job of explaining the significance of those battles in winning the war or how the battles were related. Band of Brothers did a much better job in that respect.

This movie exemplifies a bloody and horrible war under the utmost harsh living conditions. I served 22 years and I did see combat, in the jungles, so I can relate to a few things, but not the flame throwing, caves, ambushes such as they endured. My highest respect for the WW 2 veteran, let us not forget or Vietnam Veterans as they fought, but then came home to be insulted by their fellow Americans calling the ""baby killers"" that was cruel?",1467244800,,658,4.43801652892562

1109113,4,6305837325,"Impressive views of naval support and beach landings and good depiction of the effects of the rain.  There are several personal story lines within the progress of the war - perhaps too many tangents to the main combat theme. The Pacific theater was so spread out that a little back narration similar to old Victory at Sea movies would help place the action in the context of the overall strategy.  Japanese soldiers are often depicted as inept, suicidal targets.  At times one almost expects the behind the lines scenes to include marines breaking out in song ala ""South Pacific"".  Overall I'd rate this as 4 stars - good but not as good as Band of Brothers.",1467158400,,658,4.646551724137931

First off, the two movies are hardly comparable. Band of brother focuses on the US 101st Airborne 506 PIR Easy company and their journey from D-Day to VE Day in the ETO, while the Pacific shows us the USMC (1st marines mostly) and their journey from December 8th to VJ Day in the PTO.

I was too young to participate in the war, but I remember the times well.  Like many of you, I had relatives a-plenty who served in both theaters of war.  I have personally experienced war.  This was, like 'Band of Brothers', very realistic.  So realistic it brought back memories I never wanted to remember, but in the end, am better for it.  Character development worked well.  No doubt because they were real people who told their stories well.  I virtually NEVER give a five star rating to anything.  This one deserves it.

The Marines are not portrayed as saints and supermen, but rather as men stepped up to do their best, some fell short and others excelled. The mix of incredible action , solid acting  and slower moments to learn about the characters, gives the viewer a feel for the stress and sacrifice of these men.

I would have given it five stars but I felt that the nudity in some scenes was unnecessary as it did nothing to move the real story line along.  The scenes in particular are those in Australia and with Basilone.  Also pointing out all the mistakes detracted from it.  The entertainment industry is notorious for taking DRAMATIC LICENSE with stories to the point that there is nothing close to reality about it.  There are a few exceptions to this which you can probably count on one hand.

- and one liners

Unlike Band of Brothers, the Pacific follows three main men and their time fighting as Marines against the Japanese. The story puts them against the Japanese, the environment, themselves, and God.

I really think that this particular series brought to light the personal, inner, torment that I would expect from soldiers living in and through such horrors.

Our military generals must have suffered tremendous guilt knowing that they were sending thousands of young men to there certain death but it was a combative necessity.

1110896,5,6305837325,"This is a terrific series! It is even better than that great Band of Brothers. I had rented the DVDs once a few years back (when you could rent DVDs) and it had all kinds of extra information on them as to who wrote which WW II books (I wish Amazon Prime had a way to get this info also), from which this series came. So, I ended up buying 4 or 5 of these books, and the TV HBO series follows them rather closely, although some story is added for dramatic and storyline purposes. I wrote to Spielberg & Tom Hanks and asked them to make a similar series for the WW II Navy,  and Fly boys. Of course, this would be much harder to recreate, but there is plenty of source material to make other fantastic WW II series. I give this series an A+, and the first nine also an A+, and the final one just an A! I give the Band of Brothers series an A.

Keep in mind, this has a LOT of WW II action, with great sound and special effects. You think you are there in the battles, especially at Guadalcanal (first two parts). It is somewhat graphic in that you see a lot of dead bodies and parts of bodies lying around often, as it actually was. But there is little gore (blood squirting out, body parts flying live, etc.). There are only a few scenes of hand-to-hand combat, so this has been minimized because throughout the Pacific there was lot, especially at Guadalcanal. .

It realistically shows the excitement, the horrors, the boredom, the snafus, and the personal dramas experienced by all GIs  during combat.  I wasn't directly involved in WWII so I can't comment on the accuracy of the specific battles, but my experience in other combat situations was consistent with the scenarios in the series.  Everyone who enjoys the benefits of living in the US would benefit further by an understanding the horrific experiences of the men and  women who sacrificed for their freedom.

Well, no it isn't anything like BoB in the same way the war in the Pacific was nothing like the war in Europe.  It does have the same technically correct feel to it, it still has the great acting and it still has the same drama.  I was hooked after episode two and remained so until the end.

1111423,5,6305837325,A compelling and gritty series about the Pacific Ocean theater of WW II and the US Marines.  The first episode introduces the viewer to a group of young American Marines who are quickly forced to confront the horrors of war at Guadalcanal.  Fighting a war against a cunning and entrenched enemy on scores of islands scattered throughout the South Pacific forces the characters to come to terms with war.  The life of an average Marine was made up of periods of boring routine interspersed with times of utter chaos and hell.  How these men learned to cope and survive is a tribute to what journalist Tom Brokaw described as the Greatest Generation.,1464566400,,648,4.758928571428571

Sledge and Robert Lekie and what I think he liked the most was there love stories as a lot of the series was about that and not what there lives were like living on as they say "" Little specs of coral and rock in the vast Pacific"".

1111565,5,6305837325,"What Band of Brothers did for the war in Europe, The Pacific does for the war against the Japanese. There are a few major differences, however. This is not based on a book, though it is based on real events and memoirs. Therefore, there is no clear narrative structure, and no 'hero' per se, who holds the entire thread of the story together. There is also no commentary by veterans to help situate you in the story, and we jump from one desolate rock to the next without ever getting an idea of why those ones, how they get there, how long it takes, and so on.

It also goes so fast, and becomes so gory, that we don't really get to know the characters we are supposed to care about and by the time we do, they are taken out of the picture for various reasons such as death, injury, transfer and so on. It's almost relentlessly brutal at times. The battle scenes are great, don't get me wrong, better than you see in most huge-budget movies. But not every scene needs to look like an explosion  in a butcher's shop. Some great acting, and for me anyway, barely a familiar face in sight apart from the old Aussie granddad, one of their very hard-working actors over the years.

While every solder that goes off to war, whether it be WWI, WWII, The Korean War, Vietnam or Afghanistan and Iraq are to be commended for their bravery, it must be noted that there are many hardships to endure and that certainly was true in the Pacific.

An absolutly  first class production from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, excellent direction, production values and some very nice performances by a young cast.
The series follows three real life Marines from WWII, Robert Lieke, Eugene Sledge and Medal of Honor winner ""Manila"" John Bassilone.
There is very little rah-rah here, it presents the war in the Pacific in graphic detail as a nasty, heart wrenching slog from Guadalcanal to Okinawa.

It turned out to be somewhat personal for me, because I had a personal friend, a Marine Veteran that told me back in the 60's about the war he fought in the Pacific in the 40's. It was surreal to me, because some of that series could have been written by my friend. The stories of certain battles he told me about over 50 years ago matched the film almost to the last detail.

1111824,5,6305837325,Everything about the episodes and the whole flick is just right on and perfect. By far it is better than Band of brothers because it takes the viewer into the lives of the characters both off and on the battlefield. The character development is key to the films success as it shows the different in lifestyle of the three main guys and how their back ground/lifestyle pre-war helped with their decisions. It's action packed and redefines the War to a whole other level. Not only is it factual but it gives the viewers a 1st class seat of the emotional aspects of both the Marines and the Japanese. This is a must see and I would recommend it to be purchased by anyone whose into WWII films. I give it two thumbs up for sure.,1463529600,,724,4.37037037037037

1111861,5,6305837325,"I have only recently viewed ""The Pacific"" and I am cross at myself that it so me so long to watch it. I live in Darwin , Australia,  like many Australians I was ignorant  (until moving to Darwin!) about how  many times the war came to Australia, Darwin was bombed multiple times by the Japanese, there were substantial causalities, Australians died on their own shores by an invading force!. At school we learnt how the advance of the Japanese army was stemmed in New Guinea, with the Australian diggers halting their progress on the Kokoda Trail. We learnt about the American involvement in World War 2, including Pearl Harbour, Iwo Jima, the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima but we were never told about the individuals themselves, about their incredible courage/tenacity/bravery under such trying conditions that the American forces and the  Marines in particular demonstrated. ""The Pacific"" is a testament to that, a reminder of those incredible men who fought and died to protect the free worlds liberty, this series brilliantly hi lighted where each strategic battle took place and the savagery/bravery/sacrifice that took place and the chilling thing for me was to see how close those islands were to Australia, we owe the American soldiers and  Marines a massive debt of gratitude. I do not agree with war but I recognise bravery, courage and sacrifice, this show is a tribute to those brave men (and women) who put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms, this is a must see!",1463443200,,1500,4.889763779527559

The Pacific was a truly horrific campaign, and one that, to have an accurate re telling, needed to be produced as it is in The Pacific. Many people compare this amazing story to Band of Brothers, what many of them fail to realize is that this is actually a fairly accurate retelling of the source material, (With the Old Breed, and A Helmet For My Pillow) and that because of the type of war that was fought, and the material they used to make it, The Pacific couldn't be done like Band of Brothers.

The acting was excellent as was the direction.  However, the series failed to give the viewer the sense of immersion into the horrors of the Pacific War like Band of Brothers did with the European campaign.

They usually came in and relieved the Marines who had made the initial assault and established a foothold on the island. My dad was a combat MP and besides being General McArthur's driver for a few weeks after his retreat from the Philippines, he was a part of the creation of the Army's first non numerical division, Americal Division.  His stories to me about the soccer stadiums they stayed at in Australia and the ladies in Australia and the conditions and battles at Guadalcanal and that last Island battle they showed were so close to exactly the way dad described his experiences, it was spooky.  The only thing dad mentioned, which wasn't shown in the movie, is the way many of the Japanese solders jumped of a cliff to their death at the end of a push across the island, rather than be taken prisoner. It vary accurately depicts the ugliness of war, as it really happened according to my dad, and I think it's good for people to see that.

Obviously the fighting in each theater was different, and to that distinction, this series did a great job juxtaposing the type of battles being fought in the Pacific as very distinct from the battles fought in Europe. Thoroughly enjoyable. I will probably watch both The Pacific and Band of Brothers again.",1463097600,,548,4.71875

1112184,3,6305837325,"The Pacific is an interesting series. There are many things I like about it...but, alas, it missed it's full potential I fear. I compare it to Band of Brothers in that the story line is somewhat similar---we follow a group of soldiers during the war. We get to know them, we come to like or dislike them, and, to some extent, we feel what they feel.

But, it falls short. It's a ""little cousin"" to Band of Brothers from my view and take.

It cheapens itself with, what I call, gratuitous sex scenes. Why were those included? FAR too graphic for a series of this sort. Show romance? Sure, Show relationships being built between soldiers and girlfriends? Absolutely. Show them in bed with nudity and, again, too graphic of sexual renderings? No...sorry, again, it cheapens the program greatly.

I would mention language. The ""F"" word is flaunted about in most scenes. But, I know people would respond with 'Well, what did you expect? These are a bunch of tough guy Marines...it's the way they were/are...."" Yes, yes...I understand that. I personally don't like the language---or, at least, the amount and depth of language used but...as stated, I know folks take on this subject. So....be warned...it's laden with heavy language.

Again, there is much to commend. The story line is good and compelling. I like that greatly. And, this series, for me, could have been just that---GREAT. But, due to reasons above, it does not attain such status.",1462492800,2,1441,4.821862348178137
1112185,5,6305837325,This was so realistic that you felt all of the emotions of the actors. Every young person should watch this movie and know what their forefathers went through to secure the life and liberty that we now enjoy. Great movie.,1462492800,,221,4.55

Brutally honest, this portrayal of the levels of courage or no courage shows humanity's ability to adapt to situations not of their own making.  What this wonderful breed of men had to endure to assure that we today have a chance at living in a country that is free, I could never have imagined until I saw this movie.  The ones who came back and the ones who stayed are owed a debt of gratitude none of us can ever repay.  Moving, frightening, hopeful and courageous film.

There is a lot of blood and gore when the marines are fighting the Japanese but there are a lot of slow parts where the story is following a specific marine as he develops relationships and fulfill duties in various island warfare. There is at least one full on sex scene and another with male frontal nudity. I was going to use this video for my JROTC students as a history video but because of some scenes I will not be able to.

1112319,4,6305837325,"Not as powerful as Band of Brothers, but then, what can be. Unlike BoB most of the original men were dead by the time the show was produced, so there was no way to do the introductory interviews that made BoB so powerful. If there had been the ability to hear from the actual men, this would probably rank nearly alongside BoB as one of the best historical docu-dramas ever made. The action/war scenes are both amazing and horrific.

My big beef was the going back and forth between one of the characters back home and the people still deployed. It was necessary, but still jarring and frustrating. I've no real suggestions except to try and avoid cutting into and out of battle/action scenes, it's too visually jarring for the viewer where you go from intense focus of a guy running through gunfire to *BAM* now here's a guy kissing a girl. You're all like ""Noooo! I need to know if the other guy lives first!""  And so you fast forward through the homefront story because Eff You, I need to know! And then you're not going to rewind to watch that part, so you end up skipping most of his story. This means you don't identify as much with the homefront character (whose story is truly amazing).

So future editor types, don't switch me between in your face combat and a guy swinging a golf club. No matter how compelling his story is, I'll end up resenting him (and you) for jarring me mentally like that.",1461888000,4,1405,4.4591439688715955

At least they had the good judgment not to actually in vade the US.  But the loss of life in this war could have been much lower if they would just raise the white flag but sacrificed more of their fighters to stay in a war they could not win.  The sadness of our young men and women in the loss of their lives fighting a battle that could have be over when the Germans surrendered to the USA.

There were few cities to liberate and no adoring citizenry to celebrate liberation. There was plenty of sweltering heat, filth, grime and death at close range.

  However, the sex is gratuitous, and, I  believe is geared for a  Society with more contemporary  mores  ( remember, there were no birth control pills then)  The storyline is somewhat shallow, but the ""....oh my God I am going to die."" experience tells the story  of the anxiety of combat veterans who are hanging on to life by a thread.

Great miniseries!  I have watched twice, once when it was on cable and second time when I bought for a gentleman I know who was in the Army in WW2 and stationed in Europe.  He liked it a lot, also.  I have now bought for my husband and we will be watching it (when we have time). The story is not to be compared to other miniseries or movies of its era and topic, it has its own story of several men who enter into the Marine service and get stationed in the Pacific ""Theatre"" at the onset of our battle with Japan.  I really like how we get to know the characters and some of the things which drive them before they are actually enlisted.  Of course at the end when you meet the actual men whom the characters are fashioned after is great.  This is not just a story it is a piece of history!!

One of my pet peeves is time period dialogue inaccuracies. Young men in the 40's didn't call each other ""man"". That jargon didn't start until the advent of Beatniks in the '50's. While they're at it, they might as well have written the script to have them calling each other ""dude"". Obviously, accuracy was something the producers strived for.

The miniseries brought to life the struggles of fighting men in the pacific.  On that account it is FIVE stars.  However, as a story, it lacked depth.  There was little in the way of backstory to help me care about the characters more deeply.  It took several episodes before I was emotionally invested in the men stories.  By the end of the series, though, I wanted to see how their lives turned out.

The thing that makes this series powerful is seeing how brutal and difficult that theater of operations was for the men.  We say war is ugly business...but the Pacific Theater was truly hellish.  What it did to the men can not be understated, and this series captures that very well.  It is well worth the time to watch.",1461715200,,826,4.446666666666666

However, places like Guadalcanal or Peleliu proved to be no match to the Devil's little soldiers, better known as the United States Marine Corps. The Pacific zooms in on American heroes such as John Basilone, Robert Leckie, and Eugene Sledge, and captures the campaign from start to finish. One moment we have tears run down our cheek, mourning the loss of a fellow Marine and the next we're engaged in a pulse pounding shootout that makes our adrenaline skyrocket. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg brilliantly collaborate once again in order to retell another heroic tale from what truly is, ""The Greatest Generation"".

My father was in the 4th and landed on four islands -  Roi-Namur, Saipan, Tinian and Iwo Jima,  so believe me I know they hated the Japanese.  I also had an uncle in the 1st Marine Div that and was there from late in the battle of Guadalcanal through Okinawa.  They were both rebuilding their respective divisions for a landing opposite Tokyo  (Operation Coronet) when the A-Bombs were dropped.

1112968,5,6305837325,"I've read many of the reviews for The Pacific and have commented already on Band of Brothers. My response to everyone is that the two series bring life to two totally different theaters of war with two entirely different military strategies. What is overlooked by many is the fact that the US defeated world class enemies on two fronts by September of 1945.
Band of Brothers dealt with the land war of the US Army (and Air Force) which I categorized as an artillery/armor type war other than the landing in Normandy in June 1944.
The Pacific was always a frontal assault against heavily fortified and armed forces where overcoming one's primal fear of a dedicated and ruthless foe often decided who lived and who died. The Marines proved over and over that the Pacific was the proving ground for their unique style of close combat.
Each theater had is characteristics, and the two were as different as night and day except for the killing. Both films brought this out with incredibly realistic visual and audio cinematography, but again, illustrating the huge difference between what the combat was like in each theater.
The Pacific very effectively illustrated why the Marines quickly refused to take prisoners against an enemy whose culture defined surrender as the ultimate personal shame. The Marines leaned very quickly that to survive each of them had to become heartless, cold, ruthless killing machines thereby losing part of their humanity in the process.
I thought the most brutal part of the entire Pacific series was the frontal assault on the airfield on Peleliu where the Marines had to advance in the face of heavy fire with no cover. All one has to do is see that action alone to learn what courage, sacrifice and determination in close combat really means. No one could emerge alive from that action without having soul searing reflections later in life.
Eugene Sledge's recollection of the Okinawa campaign in his book was brought to vivid life in the film. One can only marvel that anyone came through that experience whole, and Mr. Sledge did not.
John Basilone was a genuine American hero and earned a well deserved Medal of Honor only to lose his life on Iwo Jima. The scene at the end of the series where his widow visited the Basilone family in New Jersey to give the Medal to John's father was as emotional a scene that has ever been filmed. No doubt that kind of scene played out many, many times during World War II.
Today, in the year 2016, our country has changed dramatically and face new enemies around the world. I often wonder whether we can rise to the occasion to protect the nation like the Greatest Generation did. I have my doubts.
If we ignore the lessons to be learned from The Pacific and Band of Brothers, we will be a lesser people for it.",1459123200,44,2782,4.702868852459017
1112969,5,6305837325,"You can't go wrong with Spielberg and Hanks. The cast was fabulous, with mostly unfamiliar faces taking their places among the best acting talent available. I went into this series unaware that each character was based on a REAL hero and told their own story. Cinematography, Editing and Effects felt 'authentic' to those of us with NO real way of connecting with a combat experience. The Pacific War is often given second billing in our collective reflection regarding WWll, but was fought earlier by a less prepared America, with greener recruits and in much harsher conditions than the war in Europe. Poorly supplied and often ineptly led, the Pacific troops faced an unknowable enemy that would never surrender, regardless of terms in absolutely the most ghastly of environments.",1458864000,,783,5.125

1113020,5,6305837325,"The series explores a slice of the war in the Pacific during World War II, by following the lives of several young men who served in the US Marine Corps as frontline combatants. It tries to portray a real sense of both the facts of brutal tropical island warfare and the effect that the danger and brutality had on the young men who fought it, from the American side.  If you have ever visited Japan and enjoyed the gracious hospitality of some if its people, it is difficult to imagine the vicious brutality which imperial Japan inflicted on those it wished to defeat and dominate.  It is also disheartening to learn about the incredible violence which our young men needed to also apply in order to subdue and defeat the evil empire of that time. The participants of all sides were left emotionally as well as physically scarred. Thoughtful portrayals like this should be required supplements to the history curricula of our schools.",1458259200,,935,4.730061349693251

1113091,5,6305837325,"This mini series is one of the very best portrayals of war I've ever seen, and I've been looking at WWII movies since WWII.  What I like most about it (and the same holds true for Band of Brothers) is that while we are fiercely reminded that war is hell, we are not being lectured to.  We are left to ourselves to decide whether or not this huge war was worth fighting. We are not seeing the military as a band of devils or angels. We are simply getting an incredibly honest look at what it was like to be a Marine fighting in the South Pacific---fighting both the Japanese military and a horrific environment which was as much an enemy as those fighting for Japan. I personally have patriotic feelings about our guys, and having been a Marine myself between wars (Korea and Vietnam), I can easily relate to these men and what they were going through. Another plus for me in their portrayals is that I hadn't seen any of the actors before; consequently they were especially convincing as the men they played. And
Production values are just amazing. What an undertaking for Hanks and Spielberg and all the other folks who put this and Band of Brothers together! Some of the finest movie-making you will ever see .

As for Episode 1, the final scene is one of the most memorable I've witnessed in all my years as a  movie fan. In it, maybe a dozen Marines on a Guadalcanal beach have just realized they won't be getting  supplies or re-enforcements from our ships just off the island, because these have either been sunk or have had to retreat beyond the horizon. These guys have  been kidding one of the troops because it's his birthday. So, to the
tune of ""Happy Birthday to You,"" they sing a raunchy version, repeating a verse  that goes,  ""We have really been f---ed, we have really been f---ed "" and so forth---their voices fading as they too fade away into the deadly jungle. What an opening!  Don't miss this or the rest of the series. We're privileged to have it!",1458172800,,1969,4.462395543175488

1113196,3,6305837325,"I enjoyed the movie, but it is not as good as Band of Brothers.  It is a different kind of war, and a different enemy involved that Band of Brothers, and maybe that makes the film different.",1458000000,,190,4.135135135135135

1113236,4,6305837325,A wonderful program following on the heals of Band of Brothers.  It simply didn't have the character development nor the chemistry of Band of Bros. That being said the series is a very good glimpse into the warfare of the Japanese campaign.  What I really enjoyed was during the end credits they showed the actor and the real live soldier they depicted.  It was amazing how similar in appearance they all were.  If you saw Band of Brothers you have to watch The Pacific.  It's required.,1458000000,,486,4.604651162790698

1113238,4,6305837325,"This is a drama in which real people (the authors and figures in two books) are played by actors. The action sequences are unbelievably complex and the ""at rest"" scenes are also convincing. From my perspective, this is yet another tribute to the remarkable book by Eugene Sledge: With the Old Breed. Of possibly even more interest, given the changes the world has seen since WWII, would be a dramatization of Sledge's China Marine.",1458000000,,431,4.837837837837838
1113239,5,6305837325,Wonderful program gets into the mind set of the Marines at that time. Young men in their prime riped for their famlies and friends and thrown into life and death situations. Very Good.,1458000000,,184,4.606060606060606

1113626,5,6305837325,"I learned some things that I had not known before about this most intense, fearful, and bloody theatre of war! The thought in making this movie series was to show and develop individual characters from their time before enlistment, to getting in the military, their time in country during the war, and then the return to the homeland after, and how it affected them and changed them. Most of the people that participated in WWII did not talk about their experiences after the war with family or friends. This film series show the brutality and affects these men experienced and lived through during and after, and allows the viewer to empathize and understand greatly the suffering and nightmares these true and brave souls endured. We owe our deepest and most sincere debt of gratitude to these heroes that saved the world from tyranny, horror and death that these crazy followers of the Devil unleashed on everyone!",1457136000,,917,4.884615384615385

The story telling lacks coherence. The acting is so bad that it is impossible to bond with the characters or to believe that they're on an actual battlefield.

Experiencing the war in the Pacific via the eyes of the leading characters and how the producers and directors provided a smooth transition into how the conflict of war affected their personal lives was great work.  The only and I mean only criticism I would render would be that some of the battle scenes were too long.

The Pacific war was a hard fought  war, with abject hatred on both sides of the conflict. The human side was covered as home life of the Marines was shown. I shed a tear for the Basilone family, his widow Lena in particular. I have been privileged to drive the Gunnery Sargent John Basilone highway many times, and I thank him and the many other for their sacrifices.

1113947,5,6305837325,"I followed WWII/PTO in high school in the 50's and continue watching most material that comes on TV and on the silver screen. Until this series, much like ""A Band of Brothers,"" TV and movies of WWII were less personnel and were more broad-brush. This series is up close and personnel and shows the humane as well as the inhumane side of even our troops. I'm guessing that what used to be called ""battle fatigue"" is now called PTSD and though the name has changed the results to our soldiers are the same: the gaunt hollow stare off into space; the knee-jerk reaction to a sudden loud noise; short fuse temperament.",1455753600,,614,4.54054054054054

1113952,5,6305837325,"The Pacific is an amazing depiction of what the USMC and the USA had to go through in the pacific theater in WW2. Much of it isn't pretty, polite, or fit for conversation over tea and crumpets, but it does capture much of the glory. In fact, they had to leave out some things that were true, but which are so great that they worried that most wouldn't believe could be possible. The story of USMC Sargent  John Basilone on Guadalcanal were treated that way. He won a Medal of Honor for what he did, and his story is told extremely well too, but some of his story was left out. In any event you won't be sorry if you spend the time to watch this miniseries.",1455753600,,656,4.165354330708661

1113955,3,6305837325,"Its a great production, but I don't like the colorized method of filming. It gives an eerie feeling throughout the entire production.  Also, If I wanted a romantic novel, I would go to As the World Turns, or The days of our lives. I want a war film depicting the vagaries of battle.  Too much personal information and not following the title. Which should be personalized such as ""A MARINE IN THE PACIFIC WAR"" OR 'DIARY OF A MEDAL OF HONOR WINNER IN WWII""",1455753600,,455,4.404761904761905
1113956,4,6305837325,"If you are watching this, it is likely that you have already seen Band of Brothers. This is a terrific show, but when comparing to Band of Brothers I think it leaves much to be desired. The acting is pretty good, and the realism is exceptional. Combine that with great sound and phenomenal imagery, it shapes up to be a captivating show. I personally, however, did not care much for some of the characters and felt that they left some of their storylines a little empty. They could have done more to create more personable characters, not something that just seems out of touch. With that being said, when watching this you will absolutely get involved with them and crave the next episode. I really appreciated the effort made to show us just how loyal the Japanese military was, and just how difficult the fighting was given the terrain and climate. Whether or not you like it, it is a great movie depiction of the fighting in the Pacific theater.",1455753600,,949,4.588235294117647

This is another historical true to life tale following, in this case, the lives of several marines stationed in the Pacific theater of WW II. It was very interesting, and condensed into a little under ten hours much of the ground war in the Pacific, as witnessed largely through the eyes of the men fighting it. While it was of necessity nearly all combat, the producers added just enough of the romantic involvements of those same men to keep interest high.

The credits at the end told what had become of the survivors. Very realistic. I was fascinated.",1455667200,,610,4.700934579439252

I am not going to go down the road of it's like Band of brothers, it's not. they seem to bounce around from person to person, never staying one for very long. The action is very intense, and very realistic, the way they show how the men are slipping off their moral compass is intense as well. You seem to go right with them, as if you are standing next to them instead of watching them on a TV. Over all I liked it but it seemed to be just thrown together.

1114027,5,6305837325,"Great Series!!! I expected this to be just like Band of Brothers, but it had many differences. None of which I felt were negative, but I could see how others might disagree. There were plenty of action packed scenes and many parts had me totally enthralled. However there were other episodes with little to no combat and total focus on the soldier's life during down time and training.
Overall fantastic and you're probably not going to find a better portrayal of the life that those men experienced.",1455580800,,500,4.758620689655173

Three thoughts 1) this action is more brutal, gritty and depressing than BOB.  2) I was surprised at the lack of coverage of naval operations -- which were so critical to this theater.  3) The overall strategy was given fairly short shrift -- I assume to expose the viewer to more of grim mud, blood and moral angst the Marines experienced.",1455580800,,390,4.47887323943662

1114033,5,6305837325,"Nice project of making a mini series based on two primary accounts of the major Pacific battles that the Marines fought in. This series was made in response to the European theater of war mini series, Band of Brothers. The Pacific was made by the same people and if you like one, you'll like the other. I thought that the special effects and the first hand accounts of the incidents were very well done. The series shows how great a debt is owed to all of our veterans, but especially to the World War II combat troops of the Pacific and Europe. I was looking forward to another couple of mini series based on the air war and the naval war.  I guess that is not going to happen.......",1455580800,,684,4.3023255813953485

1114046,4,6305837325,"I haven't finished viewing the entire series but thought I would speak to what I have seen thus far. The series focuses on Medal of Honor recipient John Basilone and Eugene Bondurant Sledge who wrote his memoir, ""With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa"" for which provided most of the material for the Ken Burns documentary, The War and this HBO miniseries. It appears to accurately portray the Marine invasion of Guadalcanal, Peleiu, Okinawa and Iwo Jima while also covering Basilone's War Bond involvement stateside and his return to action just in time for the invavsion of Iwo Jima. One scene I can't seem to shake is the one where Eugene Sledge is resting after a seriously graphic charge off the beach during the invasion of Okinawa where Marines were either being blown apart by Japanese artillery or cut down in large swaths by multiple angles of machine gun fire. Sledge is resting next to a destroyed Japanese machine gun emplacement complete with the gunner still at his combat position but minus the top half of his head. Sledge sits down to collect his thoughts and rest when he is slowly distracted by what must sound like pebbles landing in water. Sledge slowly turns around until he is looking and the Japanese gunner and discovers that his Marine companion, ""Sanfu"" is sitting on a ledge above the machine gun emplacement and tossing pebbles into the cavity of the Japanese gunner's head. I can only imagine what the remainder of the program will contain.",1455580800,,1475,4.811023622047244

I was disappointed that the battle at Tarawa wasn't included in the series, more than 1000 Marines died in just 76 hour in that battle. It was one of the fiercest battles in the pacific theater.

This series was at least loosely based on several autobiographical works and it should not be lost on viewers that these Marines, like so many warriors before and after, found healing and some closure in getting what happened out of their minds and onto paper. This is a very graphic depiction and shows more of the real ambiguities and rationalizations that humans use to cope with the horrors of war than most war stories and movies.",1455580800,,565,4.835051546391752

The PTSD never left him either, although he never learned the term for it. He was a great guy, but when he got mad, look out! As he used to say about the poor dudes coming home from Vietnam, ""Everything that happened in Vietnam, happened in WW-II too, except we came home to a hero's welcome. It's a shame Congress never declared war in Vietnam. I think we would've won that one too if we did.""

This is so well worth watching and perhaps should be required viewing for young people in high school.

1114201,5,6305837325,"The Pacific has to be my #1 favorite tv series of all time. Having watched Band of Brothers, the pacific was next on the list, though it is totally a series on it's own and MUCH more personal. You mainly follow Leckie, Sledge and Basilone's story, 3 outstanding marines during world war 2, though there are a total of 6 of them.

I must say there were so many scene in this series that were so hard to watch but the one that striked me the hardest was the scene in the home with both parents dead with the baby crying, and an elder next door who suffered fatal internal wounds, laying there dying, asking sledge to put a bullet through her head to end her suffering. Sledge standing there just couldn't do it, sits next to her and embraces her as she dies in his arms. From that moment on he was done killing. That moment really put me in tears.

The horrors these brave marines went through is just unthinkable....and to then come home to live a normal life. You could see why sledge hard such a hard time adjusting. He witnessed what terrible things men can do to each other. I also really loved Basilone's romance. It was like they were just made for each other. You saw how Lena and Basilone were in the war deep. It was all they knew and wanted to do, and they loved it. If I could give this series a 10 out of 5 I would. It was so brilliantly done. You got to see how each of these 3 marines fight, survive, live, think, love, and suffer during the war and after. May the world never have a war like this ever again.",1454976000,,1522,4.173469387755102

Sure, sex sells. Got it. But come on. Call it ""Marines After Hours"" if that's what you're going to do, and don't pretend to be a gritty war movie about what really happened. Plus some of the actors were such retreads from other movies that it was very distracting to see them here. I think they could have found non-retreads to play grunts. Otherwise it's like casting Leonard Nimoy as a grunt. Just doesn't work. A couple of scenes made me feel like I was right there on the island with them, but mostly it was typical Hollywood fluff, superficial, glam treatment of a serious topic.",1454371200,3,748,4.507352941176471

The powerful part of this series is the human interest with our fighting men and their families.  These are real stories.

As a Vietnam combat veteran the series ""The Pacific"" brought back memories of personal experiences of life in the jungle and the unavoidable hardships that environment presents such as the biting insects, poisonous snakes, and dangerous animals. Let's not forget the the unrelenting monsoon rains and the constant inability to feel the comfort of anything dry on your body for days on end. And of course the horror of combat. All of the above are expertly reproduced in ""The Pacific.""",1454198400,,560,4.968085106382978

Having served in a infantry unit i have some idea of what its like and honor those who actually had to see a real war. This series deals with more issues than shoot em up ( OORAHH!!). It deals with some of the emotional and social issues as well. It even depicts the anxiety attacks many warriors face. At times i wanted to turn around and shoot the SOBs that are hard to deal with. Another problem that occurs when dealing with stress situations like this. A warrior not only has to face the horrors of death and destruction but refrain from killing these sort of people as well as deal with what they become in this situation.",1454198400,,825,4.227848101265823

And this masterpiece delivers that message. Pacific season 1 grabs you by the collar and demands that you watch the rest of the series. Watch it and dare not feel a little patriotic, if not downright saluting lol",1453507200,,353,4.619047619047619
1114790,5,6305837325,"This show is awesome.  Incredibly well made that follows four main protagonists, Robert Leckie, John Basilone, E.B Sledge and the fourth one escapes me this second.  Based on multiple sources Hugh Ambrose, wrote the series, Leckie's story is almost word for word from his book ""Helmet for My Pillow"" similary Sledge's story follows his autobiography, ""Good Men Armed"".

The series follows the characters in the World War II, the Pacific theatre, while not a sequel to Band of Brothers, it does kind of follow the same idea.  The viewers follow the protagonists through various battles, such as Guadal canal.

Unlike Band of Brothers there is no downtime, we don't see character development, from their training, just straight down to gritty realism of war, with the one exception of their layover in Australia, but this is probably because the guys in the pacidic theater didn't have as much support and therefore did not rotate of out the combat zone as frquently as the men in the European campaign.

Overall the series is well made, take heed its long, probably more than the average Joe can watch in one day in a viewing binge, and the realism can cause anxiety in sensitive people.",1453507200,,1186,4.875621890547263

But I felt that it, unlike ""Band of Brothers"", spent too much time in the backstory: the personal lives of the main characters - outside of the battles. It's not that I prefer blood and gore, but I felt that this series somewhat ""sold out"" to be more of a soap opera - to make it more commercial. Entire episodes used with the love - and bed - stories of some of the characters.  Overall, still an excellent production, but it strayed from what I thought should be the intent. It *did*, I think, leave me with more of an understanding of why veterans can't really describe their combat experiences: if you weren't there, you can't ever understand.",1453507200,,751,4.604477611940299

The later parts seem to dwell too much on life back home and on R & R, which, I suppose, has its place in showing how it affected people away from the battle lines.

An uncle of mine who I dearly loved was in the First Marine Division and served on the islands  depicted in the series and wounded on two of them. He spoke to me many times about it all. I can tell you that from what he reported The Pacific was a fine representation. It was always with him. The day he came home he went to a local bar for a few drinks and then walked home in the snow. His mother and aunt were upset that he had to show such disrespect of going to a bar before home. They did not understand, but having served myself I do. To some reviewers who are bothered about the pace of much of this film I say consider how you work through difficult times in your life.

In many battles more deaths occurred than in Operation Iraqi freedom & Afghanistan combined. Excellent on par with another excellent series Band of Brothers!!

1115091,5,6305837325,"My father was a machine gunner with EB Sledge in K35.  He never EVER would talk about what happened at Peleliu or Okinawa---until I read Sledge's book With the Old Breed when I was in Air War College in 1992.  I called him the next night and told him.  He talked for 90 minutes (wish I would have recorded his words) and he sounded just like reading Sledge's book.  He never talked about it again, and he unfortunately died 4 years later from consequences from a fall from a roof he was pressure washing.  I called Dr. Sledge right after I had talked to my father, and I could tell he was emotionally impacted as he said that calls like mine rewarded him for his painful experience of writing his book that took over 20 years of family and friends' encouragement to write it.  To recently watch THE PACIFIC with my family was also painful as the movie was so moving to watch the horrors of those two battles that K35 endured.  I can only imagine what it would have been like to sit and watch THE PACIFIC with my father. Thank you for this movie.",1449100800,,1045,4.301020408163265
1115092,5,6305837325,"Every episode in this epic story of the Marines during the war in the Pacific is tastefully handled. I am sure it is considered to be an honorable piece of film. It does not glorify the horrors of war, but tries to explain the sheer disgusting act of war in the hopes of us never having such a time ever again. Spielberg and Hanks are so bloody good at these portrayals. Their work with Band of Brothers was monumental, and this series continues and even improves upon their abilities to tell the stories and keeping them honest and real without glorification.

The money spent on this series is monumental in its own right, but the results are extraordinary.

The actors were amazing in their portrayals and in the closing credits of Episode 10 (""Home""), the photos of the real men and women are eerily close to those actors in the film.

Dale Dye once again did a memorable job in being the adviser to the film, as he did with Band of Brothers.",1449100800,2,946,4.456647398843931

As for the accuracy of the events, I wasn't there, nor were any of the critics, and I can only assume that those actual participants who are still with us, had to have had some input as to the accuracy of those events depicted.  ""The Pacific"" was well worth the time spent enjoying it and I recommend its presentation.

1115155,1,6305837325,"Not really ever sure who was who, what they were doing or why or why I should care -- I'm pretty sure most of the Marines in the movie were in the same boat as me. Lots of Japanese being blown in half, Marines cowering in fear and some American atrocities though.

The Marines in the series are portrayed either as villains or victims. No personalities, no real motivations, just flat stereotypical characters that the director used to make some point about the costs of war. May as well have been watching a movie about the horrors of Vietnam, sometimes I wasn't certain that I wasn't.

One scene early on in the first episode serves as a great example: On the way to Guadalcanal, one of the Marines actually asks ""can someone remind me why we're here again?"" Just nine months, almost to the day, after the attack on Pearl Harbor this (presumably volunteer) Marine is asking why they were about to fight the Japanese. Even more amazing than that is that no one at the table can come up with a serious response until one guy, quoting Homer's Iliad, says ""His sword the brave man draws. And asks no omen but his country's cause."" Essentially meaning ""I don't know what we're fighting for, just shut your mouth and do what your country tells you to.""

It angers me when two bit politicians keep calling for ""Boots On The Ground"" with no real strategy or ending goal or even a reasonable tactical plan....More blood and guts, but to be sure, not theirs...If they viewed either of these fine films, perhaps they would think twice before volunteering our fine men and women on another fools' mission....When, and if, we put more ""Boots On The Ground"", the politicians better really know what they are asking our military to accomplish.",1448150400,,890,5.054421768707483

1115291,5,6305837325,"This is an excellent series but gut-wrenching and very graphic. It looks like Band of Brothers because the writer and production staff over lapped. To my mind Band of Brothers is a better series because of the variation in subject matter, better character development and graphics which seemed more real. But the island-hopping nature of the war in the Pacific was a tenacious slog by the American troops, exhausting not just for the troops but also for the viewer. Character development seems to translate into watching the players increase in cynicism and brutality, a fact of the Pacific theater. How these men survived is a testament to their tenacity. There are many battle scenes portraying the unbelievably harsh reality of days, nights, weeks and months under constant fire, combat exhaustion, mental fatigue, torrential rain, filth, mud, non-existent hygiene, foot rot and horrendous fear. They fought for our freedom, our liberty, a quality we seem to have forgotten as precious.",1447804800,,989,5.226415094339623

1115518,5,6305837325,"The most notable aspect of this movie series is both the graphic and emotional representation of the depravity of war.  The series is very well written and as many reviewers have written, it is well produced, casted and filmed. Modern war movies of the Private Ryan genre are visually more realistic and true to battle as reported by many of the men who experienced it. The series grows increasingly dark as Sledge, a wet behind the ears enlistee learns what war is truly about - killing.  The final 3 parts of the series are the darkest and without a doubt the most gruesome of any series I have seen.

Upon his return, suffering from PTSD and survivors guilt, Gene Sledge finds himself a radically changed and confused man who despite his surviving the war realizes that he in 3 years has accomplished nothing but surviving and killing.  When being interviewed by a pretty young administrative clerk for job placement she goes over a checklist of skills that he must certainly have learned in the Service when she reaches the bottom and asks him what did he do Sledge responded cooley that the Marine Corps taught him to kill Japs and he became damn good at it.

May young men never have to fight, die and live through what were the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa and may God rest the souls on all sides who did.",1446422400,,1314,4.5508474576271185

1115614,4,6305837325,"First things first, as a mater of history the war against Japan was won by the combined efforts of all the US armed forces, with some help for our allies. You never read  that much about the Australians or US Army fighting in New Guinea, or in the battle for Guadalcanal three sailors died for every marine,  but with that disclaimer out of the way let's talk ""The Pacific"". Usually when I see a war movie based on actual events the movie execs, directors, and writers, in their search for drama they often feel that they have to compromise the actual facts, or the fate of the war rested on one man, etc, etc,. With ""The Pacific"" thankfully any compromises are minimized and the story about Americans of the 1st Marine Division at war through the eyes of three marines with all their faults and virtues. I'd give it five stars but for all the scenes were a marine is staring out with a vague expression on their face in a attempt to show the individual impact of all the horrors of war.",1446076800,,987,4.387978142076503

I live in the Eastern part of Utah and knew many of the men who served in WW II went to the Pacific theater of war.  I had some idea of what they did but members of my family were in North Africa, Normandy  or in the navy.  I was so impressed with this production of what it was for those who served in the Pacific.  No one knows how bad it was unless he or she was there.  There are no words which express the depth of  emptions in war, for each individual.  This mini-series comes as close to being there, at each of the wrenching island battles.  In the end, I cried for all who served, for those who didn't come back home and for those who did and lived with the memories of war.  I cried for me, with gratitude that the Allies won.  I can never express what a blessing it is to be an American.",1445731200,,903,3.901098901098901

Those who put themselves in harms way in order to protect our country during World War II may have been idealistic fools, but the certain thing is that they DID, and I'm grateful they did.  My husband and I looked forward to every installment of this series in SPITE of the fact that we were going to be horror-struck by the blood and guts, the carnage, the vulgarity passed back and forth from the characters, because we knew we were getting a REAL education into what our men (and women who served them) experienced during that horrific time.  This series manages to balance sweetness into the severity through the eyes of the characters themselves, manages to deliver a message of peace and hope, love and moral decency even in the midst of chaotic tragedy.

The Pacific follows the 1st Marine Division and the their fighting on Pacific Islands that today are even hardly remembered by the American public or the world. I know those names and the casualties figures on both sides. Just as BOB (Band Of Brothers) showed the changes each man goes thru during WW II, so does ""The Pacific"", in it's portrayal of the ""Hell on Earth"" battlefields of the Pacific. The battlefield scenes were so Dantesque that his ""Inferno"" would be a ""walk in the park"", compared to Iwo Jima, New Britain, Peleliu, and Okinawa and the other islands too. The historical accuracy of the series cannot be underrated. The settings, the training and even down to the Marines landing on Guadalcanal with bolt action 1917 Springfield rifles is right on. The Japanese and American mindsets of the soldiers and civilian populace are explained so the viewer can gain a deeper understanding of the tenacity of each. Being a Veteran of Vietnam, the only thing this film missed was the God awful smell of war. It even brought that out in one combat scene. I am glad  ""The Pacific"" was made so that another generation of the American people can appreciate the sacrifice of many young men of ""The Greatest Generation"".",1444867200,,1334,4.850877192982456

Choosing to showcase the war experience of three different men who never met each other was intriguing and done with an expert hand. There was a certain romance to BoB that is absent from the Pacific. The series does a great job in putting viewer right there. You become emotionally invested in the lives of each man as they progress through the war, which can at times can be exhausting. Unlike the war in Europe, the end of the war for many Pacific veterans did not feature the massive welcome home parades. The Pacific was just as riveting and dramatic as BoB, with the same great writing, acting and production values.

1116024,5,6305837325,"I read Sledge's ""With the Old Breed"" a long time ago, awesome book by the way.  I have not read ""Helmet for my Pillow"" yet, but it's on my list.

The Pacific was awesome.  Just awesome.  Each episode has a few nuggets you have to deal with and I got done with the series feeling extremely melancholy.  Really well produced, I would say pretty accurate compared to Sledge's book.  I was obviously not in WWII but my dad was a Corpsman with 2MarDiv at Tinian, Tarawa, and Saipan and then he did time on a sub-chaser, and what he was able to relate to be as I was growing up and up until he passed away, I would say this series captures a lot of what our guys went through in general.  And back then you didn't come home until you got killed, horribly maimed, or the war was over.  Makes you have an appreciation for 6 x month deployments, hot chow and the internet.

All of the actors are awesome, really enjoyed John Basilone's character/actor, really good.

In the end, you just have to think about all of the Marines that didn't have to get killed because we had the A-Bomb.  Thanks God for Marines and nukes.",1444262400,,1110,4.288461538461538

The Pacific  too is outstanding as the series quite realistically portrays the Pacific Theater of WWII as the horrific violent yet heroic war it was with particular focus on some of the more historic battles against a maniacal and suicidal enemy. Of course, intertwined with this are the emotional personal stories of the soldiers that participated in the War.

Suffice it to say that if you loved ""Band of Bothers"" you will be anything but disappointed with ""The Pacific.""  On the ""General"" rating system scale shall we say I give it a resounding FIVE STARS.",1444176000,,688,5.070796460176991

1116274,4,6305837325,"This unflinching narrative of the Marines' actions in the Pacific, during WWII, is well written, shot, edited and acted. (I was especially impressed with Joseph Mazzello's playing of Eugene Sledge, who transforms from a bright-eyed idealist to a battle-hardened killer through the course of the horrors experienced by him and his fellow combatants on both sides of the war.)

Why it gets four stars instead of five: These may be quibblesome points for other viewers, but does every episode need the same 3-minute long opening credits? Over the course of the ten-part miniseries, that's 1/2 hour of unnecessary airtime. Also, the background music, which is mostly cliched, corny and overly romantic, does nothing to enhance the series and is downright annoying in places. In terms of a soundtrack, this series begs for music in the style of William Schuman, taut, modernistic and distinctly American. The opening credits would work so much better with the opening bars of Schuman's 4th Symphony, a piece that debuted publicly just a few weeks after the Pearl Harbor attack and captures the spirit of the times. With a better soundtrack, this exceptionally good miniseries could have been a great miniseries.",1443225600,,1206,5.184615384615385
1116275,4,6305837325,"My dad was a Sea Bee for four year during WWII in the South Pacific.  He was on Guam, Tulagi, Guadal Canal and many other islands in the Solomon Island Chain.  I grew u on stories about fighting the Japanese, losing his buddies and all the rest of the life of a Chief Petty Officer in the 27th NCB.  Besides the enemy they experienced all the same dangers the Marines and the Army faced.  So I feel this series is pretty close to what really was experienced by our men.  It is also quite close to the many books I have read about war in this theater.  My wife watched it with me and asked about all the cigarette smoking, and did all the men do it?  I told her that they did.  Many, like my dad, never smoked before they enlisted and he came home with a three pack a day Lucky Strike habit, the kind with no filters.  Most all of them smoked because they wanted to be part of the crowd, to prove they were a man, because it helped deal with the stress, and, eventually, because it was such a strong habit.  Like in this series, dad became indifferent to death all around.  Indifferent to slackers.  Indifferent to anyone outside your platoon.  He was there two years, home for sixty days, and back in the war for two more years.  The last two, he just did not give a damn about living or dying, just as the Marine and Army veterans on the islands with his battalion.  I really like this series and will continue to watch it.",1443225600,,1424,4.1838235294117645

The difference between this and ""Band of Brothers"" is that more of these soldiers' civilian and romantic lives are brought into the plot, which at times seems very interrupting and  unnecessary. Overall a superior production. It's hard to fathom what these Marines went through in WW2 under some of the war's most trying circumstances.

1116514,5,6305837325,"As an avid WW2 reader I was pleasantly surprised by Brothers in Arms and The Pacific (kinda a sequel miniseries) in regards for their accuracy and poignancy in capturing the many challenges facing soldiers in WW2. While Brothers In Arms focuses more on the battles and heroism of the 101st Airborne Division and less on the back story and fatigue following long spans of combat, The Pacific nails the truly darker side of war. Capturing the hopelessness and despair of the soldiers, making them more human , yet not reducing their heroism by any measure.

I was very pleasantly suprised that I recognized some of the major characters in this show, from the books I had read about WW2 (specifically Helmet for my Pillow by Robert Leckie, one of the shows main characters )which really added to my enjoyment of the show, since there are certain things that a casual viewer might not catch but a reader of the books will understand.  Capturing the dark nature of war in ways very seldomly attempted before (think Platoon, Apocolypse Now) and also illustrating the stark beauty and awesome power of the jungles in the South Pacific, this show is truly a remarkable marriage of imagery and emotion, in a way that illustrates the humanity of our war heros.

I truly enjoyed this show, and for anyone who appreciates a realistic portrayal of war , specifically WW2, I would strongly recommend this show. The music is also fantastically powerful,  with excellent crescendos and emotion.  Overall 5*",1441843200,,1490,4.873517786561265

1116536,5,6305837325,"My Dad fought in Patton's third army in Europe, and watching the intense ""Band of Brothers"" story was quite an experience.  But those WWII Marine veterans that fought in the Pacific also deserved a high quality realistic series depicting the kinds of things they went through in that war.  Remembering history is important.  I had previously read Eugene Sledge's book ""With the Old Breed"", and Adam Makos' ""Voices of the Pacific"" before watching this, which added to my appreciating the stories being told in this series.  Reading those books first gave me a prior familiarity with the characters which the series highlighted, from Colonel Chesty Puller to Caption Haldane, and Sargent Basilone,  to Sledgehammer, Hillbilly, Snafu, Haney, and others.  I also plan on reading Robert Leckie's remembrance ""Helmet for my Pillow"".

I was more interested in the strategies that resulted in victory, and the backstory on how decisions were made.  This hopped from island to island to island and really did not show how victories were decisively won and the human cost of those victories on both sides. It also lacked any story line around how and why the troops moved from place to place.  They just got back on the ship and went to a new island-end of story.",1440979200,,547,4.323529411764706

The battlefield scenes reminded me of the realism and gore of the the movie ""Saving Private Ryan"" directed by the same Spielberg/Hanks duo. Those scenes are hard to watch, but accurately convey the chaos and intensity as well as the random impact of violence on soldiers and marines in battle.  it's good to be reminded of the island-based Pacific campaign which is sometimes overlooked in favor of the land-based European theater in WWII.  This is basically a Marine story.  Among the crowd a few individuals are singled out to personalize the impact of war on families.  By the end of the miniseries these individuals come into sharp focus whereas they tend to get lost in the crowd in the first few episodes.  There are simply too many faces to sort through.  Credits at the end of the miniseries show a few of the actual men and women whose experiences provide the basis for the stories that are told.  Unfortunately issues of race in WWII are entirely ignored in this miniseries - which pretty much reflects how the military (and the nation) functioned at the time.",1440979200,,1134,4.779487179487179

 It is vastly more powerful than either ""Saving Private Ryan (with its known stars)"" or ""Band of Brothers,"" both of which showed us the European theater, in many ways a very different WWII, with a profoundly different enemy ethos that did not require the death, not surrender, that the Japanese brought to the Pacific theater.  That dreadful ethos made the Pacific war the horrific nightmare that this HBO series
represents (as well as can be, for general public viewing) so powerfully.

Band of Brothers was special in the heart of Anericans because of the narrative following the characters that make a strong connection with the viewer, but The Pacific failed to recreate that which made Band of Brothers so special.  A few episodes feature historical battles are edge-of-your-seat intense, and help fill in the back story to history's famous Marines. However, the viewer feels detached to characters.  The episodes which feature the characters outside of battle feel tries to force that connection on the view, but fails to do so.

Nothing at all about the air war and precious little about the naval operations that won the war.  Not a hint of the overall strategy of the Allies.

1116833,3,6305837325,"The technical aspects of filming the battle scenes, eventually getting on screen especially by means of the battlefield story a realistic sense that transcended the cinematic sense, were equal to the best and better than almost all other such films. Thus, for me, this film portrayed dramatically the truth that despite all the training that makes a military unit one to make it fit for fighting at its best, each member of the unit still has a different emotional and value guided personality that is to various degrees different from those of all the others, such that internal conflicts erupt that not only play a significant part in determining whether or not they will overcome the enemy and survive by doing so but also whether they will keep their own differences with each from deciding the outcome badly. It's not that other such films don't try for this but that this one succeeds more than the others by getting beneath the filmic conventional battle scene narrative. Away from the battle field scenes, the film's narrative foundation becomes too conventional, therefore predictable, bordering on failing credibility. The last half of the final episode is more original and believable, but not enough to make 'Pacific"" a 'Band of Brothers' 4 or 5 star film for me.",1439942400,2,1275,4.962616822429907

1116870,5,6305837325,"Beginning with its majestic score by Hans Zimmer, this story of a band of marines fighting in the Second World War is riveting and compelling. Most of us are familiar with the war in Europe---fought largely in cities and villages---while having little or no idea of the terrible, brutal, close-in jungle warfare fought in small islands from Iwo Jima to Okinawa.  This HBO mini-series tracks the lives, and all-too-often terrible deaths, of a band of marines, from boys to men.  There's not a lot of sanitized or idealized on display here: the filthy mud, rotting corpses, brutality of war, coarsening of spirit is full-on displayed, side-by-side to heroism and loss that makes one weep.

You won't find a John Wayne, Richard Widmark, or Robert Mitchum in starched, clean clothes. No celluloid heroes here; only real heroes.

 Tom Brokaw was right:  this was America's Greatest Generation.",1439596800,,888,5.089655172413793

It focuses on a group of marines and their journey through the Pacific Islands, liberating them one by one. Most of the storyline is based on the published memoirs of some of the marines, not sure how accurate since I haven't read the memoirs.  Lot's of action scenes and lot's of violence, but it also give a good feel for the human cost of and the struggle of the individual soldiers and the limited understanding of their families at home on what was going on.

1116976,5,6305837325,"This series is on par with it's sister series Band of Brothers. This series did an excellent job of depicting the actual everyday life of a mud soldier in WWII. In the early days of the war America was not very well equipped nor soldiers prepared for the rigors of jungle warfare on such a huge scale. America persevered through the early years of the pacific campaigns by sheer brute force as evidence by the staggering casualty rates, particularly among the marines. The series was well cast and directed to give the viewer an entertaining program while providing them with an appreciation of what the soldiers, sailors, and marines endured during those dreadful years.",1438992000,,671,4.894736842105263

1117148,4,6305837325,"I went into the movie knowing its language was explicit, so I was not shocked. However, I do find it ironic that neither Eugene Sledge in His book ""With The Old Breed"" nor Robert Leckie, in his ""Helmet For My Pillow"" (the main source writings for the movie) felt that profane and obscene language or explicit love scenes were necessary to acurately portray the World War Two Marine Experience. HBO merely superimposed modern public acceptance of foul language over World War Two private usage of foul language. I believe that many if not most World War Two Marines cursed.

Great series allows you to see the often over looked Pacific theater where men half my age were considered ""old men"" and even though one cannot compare atrocities of any war, the everyday condition of mere existence seemed to be beyond what anyone, particularly a young man in the marrow of their life should ever have to endure.  I now know why this generation, whom I was privileged to be around as a young boy growing up, was so kind and yet strong.  They never complained and they always helped anyone they could.  I believe because they learned in spite of all the horror they saw, that life was not just to be lived but that it was privilege and one that they honored daily in thoughts and actions for the rest of their lives.  It was a privileged to be reminded of that with this fine  yet brutal series.",1437696000,,967,4.344444444444444

Don't get me wrong. Total respect for the actual historical figures this series attempts to portray.

But after two episodes of watching kids just stare agog at one dead soldier after another, finished by ""Congrats, you're heroes boys,"" I got the sense that the writers and directors are more playing to the American admiration of WWII to garner viewers than trying to let the truth of the story speak for itself.

If you want to just watch a war show, then it's well done and I can recommend it to you.

And the actors really are great, despite the mediocre writing.

The Band of Brothers covered a single unit training and in battle in the European Theater. For this reason, there was character continuity which made it more interesting.

1117582,5,6305837325,"""The Pacific,"" a micro-look at the United States' WWII-in-the-Pacific-theatre experience, is riveting television. The plot lines -- based on real-life characters -- are compelling and illuminating. The series follows the experience of a handful of Marines engaged in some of the most difficult military actions of WWII. The stories are personal and detailed. One episode, which tells the story of the US involvement fighting the Japanese in New Britain, portrays an even more challenging encounter -- a war with tropical weather. Weeks of drenching rain drive the men to distraction, taking a devastating physical and emotional toll on them. Overall, this series is well written, well acted and beautifully produced. And the final episodes -- on the battle for Okinawa -- portray the tremendous heroism demonstrated by Japanese and American soldiers, locked in a struggle to the death. They also clearly demonstrate the cost of what might have happened if the United States had not used the atomic bomb to blow the Japan's leaders to their senses.",1436832000,,1047,5.275449101796407

1117969,5,6305837325,"I just have always loved Band of Brothers and was excited about which ""company"" or units we will be watching but as the series went through three main soldiers' different perspectives of the war and their comrades, they who cross path in the movie knowingly and unknowingly fighting on the same turf, side by side. It was interesting to see that in a series. You learn and understand these men inside and out from beginning to VJ Day. It puts you in the mindset of what it must have been to see what carnage man could inflict upon one another because at times I was even confused, not to following along the story but, just as Eugene Sledge, *spoiler alert* (a major character mid series to the end) was confused during his Okinawa campaign. I don't want to give specific details but what he encounters on Okinawa along with his fellow soldiers just makes me proud to know MOST of these men volunteered, for what I could only imagine was the closest thing to hell on earth and a ""paradise"" only so many can endure. I give the series 5 stars for the history, the story lines and fact that I know why now the road near Camp Pendleton, U.S.M.C. is called Basilone Road. Thanks to this series I feel a sense of pride and honor as I drive down that part near I-5. What I especially enjoyed were the use of different references and characters to mix it up a little. For instance in Band Of Brothers, you follow a company but in reality we maybe understood 10% of Easy Company, as they would need a ton of trained extras to really show what a company is. In The Pacific they seemed to make sure a lot was going on but still understood the story. Great series in my opinion and great gift for people fond of War Action genres.",1436140800,,1718,4.355140186915888
1117970,4,6305837325,"Not as good as Band of Brothers...but still very enjoyable. While it is not as historically accurate as Band of Brothers either, I do like how they strung together multiple accounts from books written by three veterans who served in these campaigns, and wrote about their experiences. I thought they did a decent job of weaving the material from their books together into a mini series, while still maintaining the power and significance of each of their stories.

I thought it was well cast with top notch performances. While the production itself is epic and lives up to that of a big budget blockbuster. (Ultimately, I give this 4.5 stars)",1436140800,,642,4.836363636363636

The Japanese were unlike any people we've every fought. Every one of them would die before surrendering to the Allies. Taking the country would've cost millions of Allied and Japanese lives.

1118472,2,6305837325,"I purchased ""The Pacific"" after having read most all of its Amazon reviews, favorable and not, thinking at the time that this multi-dvd WWII series would have the same production value as another Spielberg/Hanks collaboration, ""Saving Private Ryan"" which I had seen and was wowed by years earlier. It did hold these values, in my opinion, for the most part except for one glaring, and perhaps,  unforgivable truncation of history, the Battle of Iwo Jima. With its black, and intensely hot volcanic sand on its beaches each square foot zeroed in on by the mostly hidden machine gunners, artillery men, snipers, and armor of the Japanese forces stationed there this island was literally Hell on Earth for the Marines who fought there. From the get-go this operation was a bloody mess that took 36 days and cost the lives of thousands of men on both sides before it was over. But, for me, it was the omission of the raising of the Stars and Stripes on Mt. Suribachi that dumbfounded and disappointed me to the bone. It broke my heart. Perhaps one of the most iconic and important events in the Pacific war to boost both Marine and eventually U.S. morale, an event that was immortalized by photographer Joe Rosenthal, was completely missing. Please forgive me, and honestly I don't usually rant like this, but I found this omission both shocking and thoroughly inexcusable. Shame on the producers, the so-called professionals who put this series together. Shame on you.

On the basis of this assessment alone I gave this series a much lesser rating than most reviewers have and have even considered giving this can full of blood, gore, and somewhat ill-conceived artistic license away to the library, or possibly even to the recycling facility in town. Yes, it bums me out THAT much. Perhaps Mr. Spielbeg and Mr. Hanks might consider a rewrite and a refilming, what would end up being a necessarily expanded version, of this part of the story? My wish.

(""There"" to me, includes the jungles of Vietnam, Cambodia, the deserts and towns of Afghanistan, Iraq and every other place in which our men have fought.) This series brings us closer to understanding than anything I have ever seen.

Great fight sequences, good in depth character profiles, and real heart from the performances.  For me the only reason was not 5 stars is that it was a little disjointed at times.  Band of Brothers followed one company and was very well structured.  This felt scattered or jerky at times.

Rightly or wrongly, I compare this series to ""Band of Brothers"" and it suffers in the comparison.  I've watched 5 of the 10 episodes so far and although the production values are true HBO quality, I'm finding the script a little slow and the characters less compelling than BOB.  I'm hoping the second half of the series delves a little deeper into the characters internal life.  I started watching the series in the hope that it would be enlightening from a historical perspective, but so far not so much.  I'll update this review when I finish watching the complete series.",1433980800,,666,4.706896551724138

1119505,5,6305837325,"As a vet, and one with an interest in history, I approached watching The Pacific with a keen interest. I was not disappointed. In fact, I was not prepared for the intensity of the combat footage. The Band Of Brothers miniseries did a very good job of portraying the European Theatre war from the perspective of  company of paratroopers. The heroism, and comradery of Easy Company is legendary. The Pacific takes a very different look at war. War is horror. Graphic and prolific violence writ large. The privations endured by the Marines is without equal among US combat troops. Anyone with dreams of seeking glory in combat needs to watch this for a fresh dose of reality.
The post war segment was very poignant and well done. War changes everyone who serves, and their loved ones. In some cases there is a profound and painful change. It was good to see the subject of PTSD and the reality of life after serving portrayed with such care and compassion.",1432944000,,953,4.6726190476190474

It portrays aspects of the second World War that have not been highlighted as much as the events of the conflict in Europe. It was an outstanding series that I viewed online in just two days.

I actually stopped 1/2 way thru Peiliu because I had seen it before and read about it i didn't need to see again Its that brutal.
Anyone who has ANY doubt as to why Truman  should or shouldn't have dropped the bomb needs to watch this. Navel estimates believed we would lose a million men if we tried to take the Main Island.

1120698,3,6305837325,"There is no doubt this has a high quality production value, the editing and sound and everything technical about this series is top notch. What I found disappointing about this is I never fully felt connected to the characters which was a key to its predecessor. The characters were not really fully flushed out, some may argue differently, however not having fully developed characters is a reason for the lack of connection to them. There is also not very much in the way of surprises either, not that I was expecting any, but as some of the key characters find their fate I was not surprised or delighted or even sorrowed over their fate. Again linking to the fact I just really didn't care about the characters.

What I do appreciate is the depiction of how harsh this theater of war was. I grew up hearing stories about how horrific the Japanese were. That's not to say the western forces were not just as horrific I always felt the dedication and honor the Japanese forces had/have in their fighting often came across as a completely crazy unyielding force. I was semi expecting this to be the case, however I found in this series was a more true and accurate depiction. There are several scenes in the series that show the Japanese continuing to fight and hold land and even charge as they are being overpowered by the Marines. There are also scenes showing the Marines suffer the same fate which is the best thing about this series and why it scored a 3 star instead of a 2 star rating.

Overall the series is worth watching once despite the lack of character connection, watch it purely because of it's production value, and its accurate representation of both the Marines and the Japanese forces in a part of the war which had more terrors, and what might seem like psychotic fighting by today's standards.",1430697600,3,1816,4.6191950464396285

I grew up with, and was related to many of the men that, some as just teenagers, lived these events. I had no idea of the horror they lived through.  Amazing to me that all of the men I lived around all my life that fought in these horrible battles never once mentioned any of it.  Not once to me, or to anyone I know, that knew these men.  Everyone close to the vets would just comment, ""He went through a hard time in the Pacific,"" and that would be the end of the discussion. Not one word from the vet.

Watch this series and you will wonder how it was possible for these men to come home after fighting in the Pacific and live a ""normal"" life.

1121090,5,6305837325,"A great series and immensely entertaining! As a big fan of HBO's ""Band of Brothers"" I was excited to learn that there would be a new mini-series about the Marines in the Pacific Campaign of WWII.  My father was a Marine Corps officer (between Korea & Vietnam) and told me many a story growing up of the battles and strategies he had studied about the USMC island warfare of WWII.  To see visually what these men (some of them really just teenage kids) went through is awe inspiring and terrifying at the same time. The horrors of war has been well portrayed in modern film making (Saving Private Ryan, Fury, Lone Survivor, Black Hawk Down, etc.) and this follows that gritty, realistic style.  My only complaint about the series as a whole is that the synergy of the series didn't feel as woven through from beginning to end as Band of Brothers. Of course much of that is perhaps due to the fact that the European and Pacific fronts were totally different animals. And this is even pointed out to a degree in the final episode of The Pacific when the cab driver (who evidently served in the Army in Europe) refused to take Leckie's money and says ""at least I got some liberties in London and Paris - you Gy-rines got nothing but jungle rot and malaria. Welcome Home."" Fighting the Japanese Imperial Army in the tight spaces and hostile environments of all those Pacific islands was much different than battling the German Army in the wide open spaces of Europe. Still for both - war is hell on earth. The wrap up at the end of seeing the photos and stories of the real characters was great - much like Band of Brothers.  Great appreciation to all who serve and have served our country's armed services!  And ""Semper Fi"" to all USMC men and women!!",1430265600,,1747,4.4984227129337535
1121091,2,6305837325,"I loved the individual storylines in this movie series, BUT......the gratuitous sex scenes were over the top.  Like.....""I get it already.""  The series would have been really good without all that. Glad we screened it first.  Saving Private Ryan was a great movie that I could watch with my older kids. They learn about WWII by watching well-produced movies.  They sure don't learn it in school anymore.  I will not be recommending this series to others. There are too many other great movies about WWII out there that you can share with your family.",1430179200,,550,4.808510638297872

Solid entertainment. This is a seemingly realistic depiction of the War in the Pacific with ties to the home front. I believe that this is a more difficult tale to tell due to the nature of the Pacific war. It tries to show the different aspects of life and attitudes of the participants during combat, recovery, and R&R  As such, it is more disjointed and harder to keep all the characters straight the Band of Brothers.",1430006400,,453,4.524390243902439

4. Acknowledge that this won't be anything like Band of Brothers.
5. Come back and begin watching.

I loved Band of Brothers because every action taken by a character had me saying ""Yes, that's totally what he would do right now,"" or upset because he was hurt. There is no such character development in The Pacific. It's great if you want to see combat action in WWII Pacific theatre, but don't expect to be drawn in. As long as you don't come in with any sort of expectations, this could be a good show.

The combat scenes are quite gory, which is probably realistic. There is, IMO, too much repetition of the same thing -- fighting up close and personal with the Japanese, but I suppose the writers felt that was necessary to make the point. The best part is the last episode showing what happened to the characters after they returned home at the end of the war. I didn't realize it until the last episode that the characters were not fictional. It gives a detailed description of what each did with their life and the year they died (several are still alive). Given what they had been through, I was amazed at how well they all did.

One of the nit-pick things I wish the producers would stop doing in these war movies is constantly showing soldiers smoking, talking about smoking, asking for cigarettes, etc. While that is historically accurate (75% of WWII GI's smoked, and a 4-pack of cigarettes was included with every K-ration), I don't feel it added anything to the focal point of the story.

1121775,1,6305837325,"My father served in the Corps on Chesty Puller's staff in the South Pacific.  While of course I wasn't there, I heard him talk about his experiences, both good and bad.  I'm sure there were exceptions, as there are in any group of servicemen, but overall the Marines who reported to Puller were outstanding.  He expected and received nothing less.  The wild riotous scenes were ridiculous.  For example, a Marine just points his rifle out of a train's passenger window and shoots a farmer's cow that is peacefully grazing in a field.  No Marine in his right mind who served with Puller would have ever risked such a stunt.  Tom Hanks, the Executive Director, is anti-war and his sentiment comes through loud and clear.  If it had not been for those young men, and the veterans who have served in combat since, Hank's wouldn't have the privilege of sitting back in luxury, directing such fabrications, raking in the dough.  Obviously, this nonsense wouldn't sell as a real movie, even to the unpatriotic crowd in Hollywood, so he had to peddle it to HBO.  I seriously suggest you not waste your time with this one.  It is a dark and dreary movie, crisscrossed with smacks of ""Platoon"" and ""Full Metal Jacket.""",1429142400,5,1208,4.704761904761905

My wife and I couldn't wait to see the next episode which was available though our Amazon Prime subscription. The settings were real enough to make you believe you were in the actual events as they were unfolding. Photography and special effects were spot on. The acting was very believable with not a cheesy performance appearing in all ten episodes. I actually wept and felt a great sense of loss at the end, knowing first that it was over, and second that these men paid a tremendous price for what they went through. The script was well balanced and the drama that was going on between the fighters was second to none. Many lessons were learned by the soldiers during the various battles and many had to come to terms with what the war was doing to them on a personal basis as they struggled through to make sense of it all.

Good acting and story plots just seemed to be a bit disjointed to me personally. The story of Sledgehammer joined with one more would of been great in itself, all of them together made for some confusion at least to me.

1122073,5,6305837325,"This is once again Tom Hanks and Steven Speilburg doing their magic to bring the very real  story of the brave American Marines who faced the fanatical, and totally brainwashed Japanese soldiers who fought for their ""God on Earth"" and  would gladly have died to kill just one Marine for their Emperor.

 But, in true tribute to their absolute devotion to his Country and his people , this  series also does shows how brave the Japanese were in battle. Almost every American vet would agree (except maybe the ones that were tortured, and of course those people, men, women, and children in occupied countries,  and the pain  these abused people suffered , ... well  they sure get a pass from me).

This Japanese bravery is so unreal to most humans today, and the series does a good job of showing how dedicated they were to their cause. And, just to realize that the many of the thousands of Japaneses that fought in the madness, how few surrendered, unless very badly wounded, ...  so badly  they just could not fight back. Early on in the war the Marines learned to never take prisoners... because to try to do so could mean their very lives,and so why take a chance, when all they just wanted to do was come back home.

This is a tribute to the Pacific side of land war  for an American in WWII, to complement their other two fantastic projects together showing the European side of the land war, ""Saving Private Ryan"" and the beautiful translation from the history book written by Stephen Ambrose into the so wonderful mini-series ""Band of Brothers"".

The first time I watched it I thought it was fantastic but maybe not quite as good as Band of Brothers, But I always watch great undertakings more than one time (and with Amazon Prime it is cheap and easy). The more I watched this mini-series the more I began to realize  just how good it truly is.

For  people who have never experienced the absolute horrors and traumas that mostly young veterans, fighting for their very lives, day after endless day sometimes, (and of course always, fighting for the lives of their buddies next to them) in  the living and weather conditions that can't even be imagined by most people (except in active war zones).

This project was based on several books, all written by some of the Marines, the real people that are depicted through the series. And unlike the Band of Brothers series, this does a very touching job of showing the true human effects on the people who are exposed to the madness of an insane, total war. Very few people see the real cost of wars and even fewer live to tell about it. This is one more epic project by the Hanks/Spielburg team. Well worth watching..... many times.

Most of all thanks to all of you American Service Members past and present. It is the only reason why America is still ""The Home of the Free and the Land of the Brave"". Also, ... respects to the Japanese warriors, when they acted honorably.",1428710400,,2930,4.5659655831739965

It does have many gory scenes in it, but it should. It is trying to replicate what our heros (the fallen and the survivors) had to go through. I believe that all should give this and Band of Brothers a chance. It will give you a better understanding why our heros/heroines have a hard time dealing with the memories and may not want to discuss them.

1122204,3,6305837325,"Visually gripping but emotionally empty. The bar was set very high by Band of Brothers, but where that story followed the men of Easy through all their years of the war, The Pacific feels like we're only momentarily visiting a character before we bounce off to the next guy. This is in part because none of these men ever meet one another (I know, Leckie and Sledge in the tent that one time)  and two (I personally feel) the documentary interviews with the actual veterans are absent. I didn't feel like I knew the men in the war. However, The Pacific kicks butt in terms of displaying the appalling physical cost of war. Towards the end of Sledge's time on Okinawa I felt stressed just watching the show! Overall a strong cinematic entry but just not as emotionally satisfying as Band of Brothers.",1428537600,,799,4.5874125874125875

One of my favorites along with Band of Brothers. They should do more of these. Bout Africa, Sicily, Italy, d-day. Do one bout fighter/bomber pilots, what war on deck of battle ships were like.

1122793,5,6305837325,"Holds up to the standards set by Band of Brothers.  Used a different narrative style to accomplish the impossible task of adequately conveying the incredible massiveness of the Pacific Theater of War.  The scale and scope of simultaneous operations is so immense, there is no possible way to reduce it to a movie-sized image.  Rather, they follow three different, individual marines, instead of a company of soldiers.  They also crafted vignettes of life back home in the States; which illustrates the stark disparity between those two dramatically different worlds.  Fantastically exceptional performances by Jon Seda, Joseph Mazzello, and James Badge Dale.  Based on books and writings from Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie: two of the three marines depicted in the screenplay.  Great historical detail attained, with excellent production values.

1123046,5,6305837325,"An amazing look at the Pacific theater of World War II, the viewer witnesses recreations of the toughest fights against Imperial Japan.  From Guadalcanal and Peleliu to Iwo Jima and Okinawa, U.S. Marines scrap for every inch of land.  Combat is only part of the tale, however, as we see daily soldier life, some recreating during leave and even some glimpses back on the home front.  It focuses very specifically on the Marines; using this as a lone resource, a viewer might think that all the Navy did was shepherd the Marines between islands and ineffectually bombard Japanese fortifications.  This purposefully myopic view gives focus to the Marines and their struggles.  There's little said about the ""grand strategy"" of the war; these Americans are just trying to survive.  While the various Marines don't know their fates, there's no condescension to the viewer over the outcome of the greater events - it's not a mystery how World War II ends in broad strokes, the show is about men following their orders to the best of their ability.

The show's ""common man"" focus means that we see moments of levity along with moments of horror.  With glimpses of Marines' lives before service to shipping out to their first battle and beyond, we see the young men become hardened by combat, the deaths of their comrades and the sacrifices of their enemy both taking a toll.  The inhuman nature of the fighting led to barbarity on both sides - the willingness of Japanese soldiers to fight until death meant a ""take no prisoners"" attitude by the Marines, which by Okinawa was showing in thousand-yard stares and a bitter reluctance to make new friends.  At war's end, those that survive try and make sense of it all, dealing with survivor's guilt and the trauma of having seen man at his worst.  It's not always fun to watch, but it's deeply resonant by showing the true meaning of sacrifice and is about as close as anyone in the 21st century can get to experiencing what the Marines went through.

The question almost inevitably seems to come up: is it better than Band of Brothers?  Before answering that for myself, I'll say that it's different.  It's not just the setting, but also the sourcing.  The Pacific is based on the memoirs With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa by Eugene Sledge and Helmet for My Pillow by Robert Leckie, with China Marine and Red Blood, Black Sand also credited.  This use of primary sources gives the series a gritty, historical flavor - it feels like the watcher is there with the Marines and is shown the full measure of courage and sacrifice these men displayed.  By contrast, Band of Brothers is based on the book by Stephen E. Ambrose, a secondary historical source.  There were also liberties taken with events to better create a narrative with what was happening to Easy Company.  Now, this isn't to say that Band of Brothers has no worth historically, but it does make it closer to cinema than a documentary.  Adding to that, the cast of Band of Brothers included Michael Fassbender, Ron Livingston, Tom Hardy, Simon Pegg, Jimmy Falon and David Schwimmer.  In The Pacific, the cast is comprised mostly of unknowns.  While both casts performed extremely well, I found it distracting to see noticeable modern stars embedded in the historical action of World War II.  The influence of Spielberg could also be seen more readily in the narrative of Band of Brothers, which is (again) a stylistic thing, but I found a bit disorienting in BoB, ostensibly a historical tale about real men.

So having established BoB and The Pacific as different, which do I prefer?  As a lover of history, I come down decisively on the side of The Pacific, which feels about as definitive a filmed work can be from the perspective of Marines in the Pacific during World War II.  It's something than anyone with interest in World War II or military history should watch.",1427932800,,3885,4.752608047690015

It does really give what I would think is an accurate portrayal of what it was like in the Pacific campaign for the Marines who were there. I've been an avid history buff for about my whole life (and I'm not a young man), and from what I've read and heard in interviews, this is right on the money.",1427328000,,457,3.9782608695652173

1123675,5,6305837325,"The technical part was accurate. One of the groups portrayed in the series was a light machine gun squad; at first using a .30 water-cooled gun, then later changed to .30 cal air-cooled model.  The former gun had a larger crew and was used in WWI, the latter introduced early in WWII.  The same goes for the Marines using  Springfield bolt-action rifle then the semi-automatic Grand.  However, for me the best part was the horror, the emotional ups and downs, the courage, the dead and the survivors, the here-today-and-gone-the-next-second, all painful to watch; it truly was a generation a part.  If any of those marines are your parents' friends or relatives, relay to them how much you appreciate their sacrifice.",1427328000,,717,4.941666666666666

It begins before the people join the military so you follow them through their time with their unit and ends by showing how they reintegrate back into society.

1124174,5,6305837325,"Gritty, unrelenting account of the horror our men in uniform had to go through at such a young age.  It's amazing that anyone can come back from that with their psyche intact.  I think many Americans are unfamiliar with the Pacific action that took place in WWII.  Excellent storytelling through the eyes of 3 soldiers, 2 of whom wrote books that this movie is based on.  Produced by Spielberg and Toms Hanks, you can count on historical accuracy and a quality film.  We binged watched the last 6 episodes.  So riveting, the time flew by.  The actor who played Eugene Sledge was especially outstanding and if this were a feature film, he should have the Oscar.  Highly recommend this film to anyone interested in WWII or a war film that ""tells it like it is"" and holds nothing back.  Excellent in every way.",1427241600,,807,4.5874125874125875

1125041,5,6305837325,"This is my third or fourth go-round with this splendid series. First watched when it initially aired on HBO, with at least a couple more viewings of various episodes while it re-ran, and now again streaming via Amazon Prime, it continues to satisfy. Needless to say, it's great to be able to see it on my terms, whenever the mood strikes me.

I must confess that despite the fact that I'm an avid World War II buff, whose father was a sailor on the USS San Francisco during the Pearl Harbor attack, I wouldn't have given The Pacific 5 stars based on that first watch. Four for sure, but since then I've read Eugene Sledge's ""With the Old Breed"", am halfway through Leckie's Guadalcanal novel ""Helmet for My Pillow"", and have re-re-viewed Ken Burns' PBS series ""The War"" which features both Marines. 'Course, there's always more to experience with a book over a Hollywood adaption, but you've gotta hand it to Playtone-Speilberg-Hanks; they may a terrific combination.

If you haven't yet made the decision to take in this marvelous series and are an Amazon Prime subscriber I recommend it without reservation. Take 'em one at a time at your leisure or binge watch them, I think you'll savor them as much as I have.",1426636800,,1214,4.668224299065421

I had preconceived thoughts about this series; i.e. John Wayne typical movie -- I was wrong!  Great series - takes the WWII Battles, fought in the Pacific, out of the bland history books and gives us a very realistic concept of what war was really like; i.e., compare the protective equipment, clothing, and weapons the Marines had and compare with what today's solders have in combat - we've come a long way.

Since there is so much in it that I know I can't trust, it makes me doubt whether I can believe anything in it I saw.  I don't know everything about WW II and after having seen a number of WW II films in recent years that took great pains to get every thing from tactics to uniforms correct, I was looking forward to learning something.

1125730,5,6305837325,"My rating is based upon the first day of the first season, which I watched a week ago. I will definitely view all, in order. I recognized the authenticity of the production at the outset, because I felt like I was back in the Corps. I joined 12 years after WWII ended. But these Marines' language and banter and cultural mannerisms were identical to my recollection. These are the guys who were Gunnies, Master Sergeants, and Sergeants Major when I was in the Corps--these are the guys who taught me. Looking at today's Marines and their gear and assignments, I definitely am ""Old Corps"" because I climbed down those cargo nets and went ashore in those Mike boats. Those Mike boats used in the production looked awfully old for our first Pacific invasion--I would have expected new ones at Guadalcanal, as the boats were virtually new. One of my sons watched the movie with me, and I pointed out that the movie's night firefight to the death was the Marines' only option, because they had apparently not yet established artillery support at that point, and they'd seen the fleet battered and retreating over the horizon. That firefight and the aftermath reminded me of why the island hopping war in the Pacific became pretty much ""take no prisoners"" on both sides.",1426464000,,1264,4.75

1126510,5,6305837325,"I count Band Of Brothers as one of my favorite movies of all time, so I was very hesitant to watch the Pacific given the 'revisionist history' comments in a lot of prior reviews. I'm very glad I finally ignored those posts and watched this great series. While I didn't get the sense of really getting to know the characters as well as I did in BoB, there are still some great individual stories that weave throughout the series that allow you to become familiar with many of the key players.  I assume the same level of character development wasn't possible due to many of the veterans having passed by the time this was made, unlike BoB, which had interviews with the real veterans throughout the series. Vivid, brutal, emotional, but well worth the time to watch.  I can only hope that Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks are researching history for their next miniseries!

To address the revisionist history subject, this series is completely based on the American point of view, with in my memory only two specific Japanese characters featured for a total of maybe 2 minutes of the 10+ hours of the series.  It wasn't about them.  If it were filmed from the Japanese perspective I would assume the violence shown to the Marines would be just as bad, if not much worse.  Yes, it shows that Americans committed incredible violence to the Japanese in and after battle, but also shows the atrocities the Japanese committed that led to the deep, justified hatred the Marines felt towards them.  I did not get the sense that it was trying to show the Americans as somehow worse than the Japanese in World War II, it simply showed from the Marines perspective how brutal and violent the battles for the Pacific Islands were and what young men do to cope and survive.",1426032000,,1758,4.633440514469453

I suspect that The Pacific is a more accurate portrayal of just how horrific and utterly stupid war is. The amount of death and the waste of life sickened me, and after the first installment, I got the picture. I didn't need subsequent episodes to drill it home, but that's what happened. The individual story lines were weak and I was never able to attach myself to the characters in a way that made me want to see how it turned out.

1126745,5,6305837325,"This is an outstanding series for the following reasons.  First, it portrays the humanity of our marines and their families while maintaining the heartwrenching stress warfare brought upon both the combatant and the noncombatant.  Second, the genuine human needs and limitations of the marines while not in combat keeps the viewer in touch with their incredible courage and integrity while in combat.  Third, the return home of the marines was kept realistic by its lack of fanfare, by the ptsd of one marine in particular, and by the interview of some marines portrayed in the miniseries.  Fourth, the acting, filming, character development, and scenes were completely believable.  The only criticism I have of this miniseries is that at times it is emotionally exhausting, even depressing to watch some of the scenes.  Unlike some films that use horror to entertain, this series uses it to empower the viewer to identify with the desparate determination of the marines defending us.  Since my father and one of my uncles fought in the Pacific I may be biased, but this miniseries is one of, if the the very best I've ever seen.",1425945600,,1129,4.973404255319149

It takes on a level of brutality unknown and unfaced by US troops fighting the  Nazi's. My dad faced the Japs in the Philippines. He witnessed the slaughter in Manila. He fought that war every night until the day he died some fifty years later. All war is a waste, but one needs to realize that like the Russians our we won despite our Generals like dugout Doug.

1128435,5,6305837325,"The Pacific was the Asian version of Band of Brothers.  While similar in approach, they were separate in stories.  The Pacific follows three Marines into the jungles during World War II.  Again, like Band of Brothers, the Leathernecks are as large as life and in your face.  They were young men thrown in to do the work of adults at the bidding of people far removed from the fronts.

The acting in The Pacific was fantastic.  Again, like the country they represent, the Marines are from varied backgrounds and ethnicities.  Unlike European WWII with the numerous Americans from those countries, very few Asians were along.  Sad.  Think of the good that might have come of that.  Oddly, the movie was shot almost exclusively in Melbourne, Australia.  Anyway, The Pacific is a reminder that the people who truly fight and win the wars lose nearly as badly as those who lose.",1425168000,,873,4.753333333333333

1128484,5,6305837325,"Close to ""Band of Brothers"".

What I had forgotten was the Medal of Honor winner on Iwo Jima and what happened to him.  The actors (recommend you watch all the way though) are uncannily resembling the actual person's (yes this actually happened to the person's that the actors portrayed).

The action shots were realistic enough to cause me to wince, and replicated what actually occurred on at least Iwo as my uncle portrayed it to me many years past.

Be careful, this series is very addictive.  Once you start you probably will not be able stop until the closing credits.  Do watch the last episode's closing credits, its well worth the time.

While the Eujropean Theater of Operations was no walk in the park, war in the Pacific was a clash of cultures that knew little to nothing about each other.  No marine went there already speaking Japanese.  The brief treatment of the return home for these brave men was highlighted by seeing the actors and the real subjects at the last segment's conclusion, with capsules of what they did after the war.  It was amazing to me to note how much the actors looked like thier real life counterparts.",1425081600,,562,4.534653465346534

It had ups and downs, but I think it could have been better with a small amount of narration in the beginning like in Band of Brothers. It creates more emotion and also sets the scene for the episode. It could also provide a little more background and overview of the war. I love the idea of turning what could be a documentary into an epic 10 part series in a Hollywood production, but I wish it retained a little of the documentary aspect to give it a little more depth. Still a great series though. If I didn't watch Band of Brothers first, it would still be only a 4 star rating.

1130151,5,6305837325,"In 2001, HBO first broadcast one of its very finest television programs ever: ""Band of Brothers,"" a ten-part miniseries that told the true story of the men of Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, one of the most famous and highly decorated U.S. Army units that fought during World War II.

""Band of Brothers"" focused on World War II in Europe as seen through the eyes of the men who fought from the beaches of Normandy in 1944 to Germany's surrender in 1945. The miniseries showed, with graphic detail and realism, the full horror of the war in Europe, and how one U.S. Army unit's courage, determination, and sacrifice contributed to the ultimate victory over Nazi Germany.

In the light of ""Band of Brothers'"" enduring success, many people asked: would HBO ever produce a miniseries dedicated to the courageous men and women who fought in the Pacific during World War II? After all, Americans fought just as bravely and made just as many sacrifices of life and limb to achieve victory over Japan in 1941-45.

That question was finally answered in March 2010 with the premiere of ""The Pacific,"" a ten-part miniseries dedicated to telling the story of World War II as it was fought by members of the 1st Marine Division, U.S. Marine Corps, in the Pacific theater of operations. ""The Pacific"" is outstanding in every way. It's tough, gritty, filled with scenes showing the unimaginable horrors of war, and the tremendous courage and sacrifice of the young men and women who fought, bled, and sometimes died in defense of their country.

Unlike ""Band of Brothers,"" however, ""The Pacific"" does not follow one particular unit as it fights its way across its assigned theater of war. Instead, it focuses on three individual enlisted Marines who were directly involved in some of the worst combat of the Pacific war - at Guadalcanal, Peleliu, and Okinawa. One of the Marines - Sergeant John Basilone - became a recipient of the Medal of Honor; two others - Privates Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie - wrote famous wartime memoirs after the war. Each of them experienced the full brutality of the war against Japan while serving on the front lines.

Taken as a whole, the ten episodes of  ""The Pacific"" provide a highly accurate and faithful chronology of the events narrated by Sledge and Leckie in their memoirs. Taken separately, each episode stands as a powerful and gritty testament to the patriotism, heroism, and character of every Marine who fought in the Pacific.

It`s impossible to describe with full justice how good ""The Pacific"" really is. Like ""Band of Brothers,"" it is a nearly perfect war chronicle. It accurately depicts real events; it is arrayed with a stellar cast that includes James Badge Dale as Robert Leckie, Joe Mazzello as Eugene Sledge, and Jon Seda as John Basilone. Among the actors in supporting roles whose performances are equally outstanding: Matt Craven, Keith Nobbs, Rami Malek, Martin McCann, Annie Parisse, Jacob Pitts, and William Sadler.

Technically, ""The Pacific"" is the equal of ""Band of Brothers"" in nearly every way. Special effects, especially in the battle scenes at Peleliu and Okinawa, are frequently very bloody and fully convey the grim brutality of war. Somehow, however, the violence never seems gratuitous, but rather seems necessary to show the tremendous courage and excruciating pain and suffering of the 1st Marine Division.

The cinematography is superb. ""The Pacific's"" producers eschewed the faded colors and grainy look that were deliberately used to give ""Band of Brothers"" its authentic World War II ""look and feel."" They opted instead to show with sharp images the full panoply of vivid, bright colors so commonly seen throughout the Pacific islands.

The six-disc Blu-ray set is one of the most beautifully crafted I've ever seen. Packaged in a ""tin can"" style container, the discs are laid out with obvious care on an internal cardboard accordion. Two episodes appear on each disc, and are accompanied by ""field guides,"" episode summaries, and other extras. The sixth disc contains several ""special features"" that definitely add to the enjoyment of the miniseries.

Simply put, ""The Pacific"" is a brilliant achievement in every respect. It joins ""Band of Brothers"" as one of the two best war stories I've ever seen in any medium. It deserves an honored place in every Blu-ray disc owner's collection.",1424908800,,4372,5.016551724137931

If you haven't seen it yet then make it one episode per week or every few days at least. It's a perfect mini series to look forward to over the course of a couple months. Will probably come back to this in a year's time and watch it the right way.

Unfortunately Amazon Prime rotates videos out so much that they cut you off in the middle of your series. I felt like I was going to miss out if I didn't watch it all on a binge. So they kind of ruin shows like this that are ideal to look forward too on weekends.",1424736000,,585,3.834710743801653

1130523,4,6305837325,"Overall, makes one realize the hellish events these heroes went through for our freedom from a disillusioned and crazed people. I have worked with many Japanese folks in recent years and I find them to be incredibly kind and gentle. It just shows how mislead we can all be by some self-proclaimed divine leader. Hitler being another that duped the people of Germany into believing they were superior beings, while the general masses turned their collective heads because ""life was good"". Little did they know in a few short years (about 12), their once ""superior"" nation would be in ruins. The same for the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Not to mention the millions they lost in the horrendous battles from island to island as the Allied forces moved towards Japan. We are not above falling for the same today. I digress. The Pacific series was very good and I had my wife watch it and she gained a much greater appreciation for the ultimate sacrifices made. There is enough romance with the side plots to keep the ladies interested, though the nudity was not necessary; but that's Hollywood. I've watched The Band of Brothers and the sacrifices made in the European theater were just as great, but much more highly publicized. The Japanese enemy were not Judeo-Christian by heritage (as were many or most of the German people) and were truly an enemy that would not surrender, but fight in a suicidal fashion. I have been to Germany many times and have several German friends. My heritage is deeply German-Jew, and it is surreal to travel where such wicked and evil actions took place because one guy had that much power. In summary, Hanks and Spielberg did it again, showing the true hell that is war, yet not going all Hollywood like Penn, Robbins, Baldwin and the others, but truly showing there to be a just cause to fight for freedom from evil, wicked tyrants. The world map shown in the first episode readily showed if we did not take the war to the south Pacific and Europe, the enemy would have brought the war to us; we would have been fighting it on our homeland as invading forces stormed the beaches from the Atlantic and Pacific shores. It truly was a world war and I may not have been writing this note today.",1424649600,,2236,4.648989898989899

The men having downtime and what they did during that time (decompress or bonding), and the ravaging effects of the war on friendships, romance and family.  The publicity tour was fascinating to follow as we think of the propaganda machine as a thing of Madison Avenue, but the realistic human side was shown here. We hear a lot about the European side of the war, but very little is told about the men who fought in the jungles.

1131130,2,6305837325,"I thought this would be a P.T.O. version of Band of Brothers.  Not even close.  Story was slow (though the timeline of events was meteoric at times - puzzling), characters underdeveloped and never really garnered my empathy.  Although the battle scenes depicted the brutality, chaos and evil of this war, the series often ground to a near-halt when centering on near-pointless personal interest of specific soldiers or soldiers/civilians.  Also, the timeline was erratic.  And with no narrative explanation of specific battle objectives it was nearly impossible to follow.  Also felt that pivotal events of the Pacific war were completely excluded.  While the novice may well understand Pearl Harbor and the United States' entry into the war, the timeline of subsequent events  - seems to me - to be critical to understanding what these two great forces were fighting for and/or against.  Pacific was not very good....not very good at all.",1424390400,,939,5.206666666666667

1131821,5,6305837325,"When THE PACIFIC debuted, it was doomed to be inevitably compared to BAND OF BROTHERS, and couldn't help but suffer by comparison.  In that light, I remember thinking that it was good, but not great.  Having just re-watched LETTERS FRO IWO JIMA, I decided to revisit THE PACIFIC, and did so this time without giving BofB a single thought.  In this light, THE PACIFIC stands on its own as a very different approach to a very different ""theater"" of war.  Where the European Theater of Operations was terrifying, the Pacific Theater of Operations was, quite literally, horrifying; and THE PACIFIC deftly captures the experience of that atmosphere with powerful authenticity.  Where BofB followed the same group of fellas from start to finish, I felt, at first, that THE PACIFIC suffered from jumping around - from unit to unit, character to character, island to island, the Pacific to The States... but upon further review (and having read both memoirs on which the series was based), I now understand how necessary a disjointed approach was in order to depict what was clearly a disjointed campaign.  Thus, at this point, a sentimental love for BofB doesn't prevent me from recognizing THE PACIFIC's quality: it both stands on its own, as well as stands up admirably to BofB.  Just as it's impossible to determine whom, the Army or the Marines, truly ""won the war"", it's absurd to pit THE PACIFIC against BofB.  They are the yin and the yan of WWII, and both series ought to be equally respected - both as counterparts, and as isolated entities...",1424390400,2,1545,4.847908745247148

1131938,5,6305837325,"Pulitzer Prize winner Robert Schennkkan and a team of other first class writers created a narrative from the writings of Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie--both of whom are major characters in the miniseries. Both Sledge and Leckie experienced the Hell of war and the disappointments of peace and wrote about them in two books that formed the spine of the series. So much better than BAND OF BROTHERS, which was riddled with errors.
THE PACIFIC shows no saints, no chest-thumping heroes--just Marines fighting and killing, knocking gold teeth out the mouths of dead Japanese soldiers, insulting each other, saving their comrades' lives, and accepting R&R with no grace at all. Notice how they suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome before the term was coined.
My wife and I watch this series at least twice a year, and we are reminded that a war movie can be a great work of art that reveals the cruelty and the surprising gentleness of men in war. Fans of ROME will appreciate the work of director Tim Van Patten who knows how to keep three or four story lines separate but related. Yes, watch this miniseries!

1132162,4,6305837325,"Great story from an impressive cast and even more impressive producer and director! How ever, the blood and gore is needlessly over the top! History has shown both sides were savage in there fighting, and in particular the way the Japanese fought was particularly gruesome and barbaric, I still think this film took that over the top and sensationalized it to some degree!  Two of my uncles fought the ""JAP's"" in the pacific through most of the battles this story depicts, and both explained that while this film is mostly accurate in depicting the fighting and the conditions in which the fighting took place, the gore was needlessly over done and not accurately portrayed! One of my uncles was a Corpsman with the Marines through most of the major battles, and his vivid memories that still troubled him greatly were not so much the horrors he witnessed, it was the dying marines in his meager hands, marines that had suffered untold horrors at the hands of the enemy that dogged him untill his last days! Because of my experiences in both conflicts I have fought in over the last 20 plus years ( my entire military life) both of my uncles shared there stories with me, because I would under stand better then any one what they experienced! I thank Tom Hanks and Stephen Spielberg for this, it opened the flood gates of emotions for all of  us vets and allowed us to share our experiences and further cemented our Brotherhood of combat solders,WE FEW MARINES!

1132271,5,6305837325,"For years Hollywood has shown war from a distance where death consists of someone grabbing their stomach and falling over (presumably dead).  Soldiers were smartly dressed, well fed and the enemy was obviously bad while our side had the virtues of saints.  The truth is that war is ugly, demoralizing and unfair to all parties.  Mini series like The Pacific (and it European campaign counterpart Band of Brothers) show the bravery of our soldiers, but also the brutality of war and the reality that the enemy was not alone in committing acts that by today's moral standards would be considered war crimes.  The winning side always gets to write the history and while there is no doubt that the Japanese and German leaders both started the wars and committed horrendous atrocities, the Allied forces certainly did not come out of the war with totally clean hands.  Society can be very glad that the Allied soldiers and their countries were willing to fight and sometimes wars are unavoidable, but before we jump into military conflicts in far flung corners of the world, we need to make sure that the cause is just and that our leaders and the public are willing to commit fully to the effort.  It's nice to imagine that man has progressed in its attitude toward conducting war by certain rules of civility, but unless all sides are willing to accept these rules, we are bound to end-up on the losing side.  Sadly war, even in the supposedly enlightened 21st Century, is a nasty business that needs to be entered into with eyes wide opened and a willingness to do what is necessary to defend the greater good.",1424390400,,1608,4.7214285714285715

The performances are awesome and every character, not just the leads, comes alive as a multidimensional character.  If you can handle the gore (of which there is some, unavoidable if the reality be at all communicated), and the heartbreaking individual tragedy, then this is a wonderful show to watch.  One thing I do find missing however (in common with almost ALL history of the early events depicted here) is the absence of the horrific experiences of the sailors in the fleet at Guadalcanal, where naval casualties were far greater than Marine casualties, but the intense and brutal actions and heroism of the Navy in these actions is largely overlooked in the focus on the struggles, sacrifices and heroism of the Marines ashore.",1424390400,,980,5.037037037037037

Don't get me wrong, the story, for the most part, is great and therefore it is entertaining, but it's not something that you come away from saying, ""that was fun to watch.""

I think that the movie did an excellent job portraying the violence of the pacific theater and a very good job of portraying the overall suffering from weather and disease. The suffering actually starts to grate on you as the series wears on, as I imagine it did 100 times more for those marines who actually went through it. I also think that they chose very good ""main characters"" to revolve their story around. Again, it was not a fun watch, but it was nevertheless and impactful and special one.

I could write for a long time about how this series impacted me and why I think it's important, but suffice it to say that if you're considering watching it then you should watch itit won't disappoint.

The film explains the struggles of combat in miserable conditions. It draws on the fellowship of individuals ""doing their bit"" and gives a deep understanding about the men who fought. Growing up on the West Coast I had many questions about ""what it was like over there.""  The Pacific casts light on the enigma of these veterans, their frequent periods of quiet reserve, stoicism and often sitting lost in their distant thoughts. The movie also captures individual heroism and strength of sacrifice that they went through day after day without exploitation. My initial expectation was that it would be like A Band of Brothers; fortunately it is not. It is a different view of ""the war."" The film doesn't equivocate on the severity of the fighting in Europe versus the Pacific, but concentrates on the variety of backgrounds of the men and their varying views about their gruesome struggles in the jungles of the Pacific. It is a story not for the weak of heart for the images are graphic.

1133168,3,6305837325,"I found the episodes addicting, and I had to watch them all, but I was disappointed by two things:  First, this series seems very slanted.  Everything is dark, every character is either killed or corrupted and no one knows why they're even fighting.  There are no heroes in this series.  In my opinion Band of Brothers was more realistic and a lot more edifying in this regard.  Band of Brothers was a lot more balanced, showing the harsh realities of war while also showing where courage and honor rises up in individuals.  The Pacific assumes that no good can survive in times of war.

My second complaint with the series is the sexual content.  Some may enjoy this, but I was in the series for the battles and such.  The romances made do add to the story lines but the casual nudity seemed unnecessary and for anyone not wanting to view it, good luck!  Hope this helps!  It is a good series, but just know what you're getting in to :)",1421366400,2,937,4.421052631578948

1133172,3,6305837325,"Not as good as Band of Brothers. The special effects are very good, the picture and sound are outstanding. There is no overall plan or story just conquer one island then another then another. Lots of rain, mud and dead Japs. Once you have seen the USMC conquer one island you do not need to see the rest, same old same old. The Japs pop up like in a video game. The sex scenes in the episode about Australia are completely inappropriate and far too graphic. John Basilone and Jennifer Grey are treated with disrespect and has no place in this series. The series does show what sacrifices were made by the USMA to preserve our freedom and free people from tyranny. I believe they deserve better than this series provides.",1421107200,2,720,4.5038167938931295

1133264,5,6305837325,"First word, outstanding!
WWII is often thought of in terms of the European Theater, of which my father fought in, but, for The United States, began with FDR's declaration of war after Pearl Harbor against Japan, including Nazi Germany/the Axis powers. This account of the Marine's battles in the Pacific Theater is an excellent account of the over-view, and individual campaigns depicted in the series through the eyes/account's of three actual soldiers.

As my father  fought  within Patton's 3rd, I am acutely aware of the details of the European Theater and expressly appreciate the often overlooked aspects of what these good men/soldiers endured and prevailed against.

As with other classics, Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, Patton, Lonesome Dove, etc., I find I watch this 2/3 times a year...it's just that good and, about what actually happened to men within a generation we owe our comfort and security to.",1421107200,3,922,5.167785234899329

1133270,4,6305837325,"This miniseries is the natural sequel to the excellent `Band of Brothers' as we follow the progress of three main characters though the Pacific campaign. Like its predecessor, the gritty realism and attention to detail makes for a very immersive and frequently harrowing experience, but whereas Band of Brothers felt like an extension of the Private Ryan character based narrative following a sequence of events with which we, in Britain, are familiar, this miniseries takes a wider view of the war in the Pacific as a whole. The early episodes are a little slow if you're expecting guns blazing blood and guts from the outset, but they succeed in introducing the main characters and provide some valuable historical context. There is a realistic amount of sitting on ships and general hanging about between battles allowing time for perhaps a little too much character development but the battle scenes, both against culturally alien Japanese and the appalling weather & conditions are truly magnificent & horribly realistic.

Well done HBO, you've done it again. Now we need another period drama like John Adams or another contemporary tale to rival the brilliant Wire.",1420934400,2,1171,5.163157894736842

As a result, I had to watch those episodes on Amazon instant play (you can't see any of the historical footage when you do that). What I was able to watch was incredible! We owe so much to our war veterans - regardless of the wars they fought in. I had no idea of what my father - who was a naval veteran from the Pacific - went through. As General Omar Bradley said, these young men and women were continuing the war when they came home and tried to fit back into a society that was clueless to what they had seen.",1420848000,,618,4.032520325203252

1133347,3,6305837325,"So far the series is pretty good, my husband and I have been watching it when we get a chance. My husband still prefers Band of Brothers. I think one of the main reasons he and I both don't like The Pacific as much is because there is so much sexuality and sex scenes, it's a little overwhelming. I got him this set as a Christmas present hoping he could find another series like Band of Brothers that he would really get into, but we have skipped a lot of scenes because we don't care to watch them. We are not shrews about that sort of stuff but it really is so unnecessary in this series. We wanted it to be all about history and to get a glimpse into what it was like, as close as a series could get to the real thing, but we really feel like all those scenes completely take away from the real message. I would suggest if you are going to watch it as a family, the parents should map out the unnecessary scenes before introducing to your children or you are going to get a LOT of surprises.

I just finished watching the HBO Miniseries directed by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg ""The Pacific"", a intertwined journey of three U.S. Marines in World War II. Sometimes a hard movie to watch due to to violence and killing but was a well invested 10 hours of TV time. I could not help but cry during some scenes, and more so at the end when I discovered the stories are true as the credits roll with the Marines real pictures and when they died and some still living. What strong men, committed to freedom and loyal to each other, and our country we had during this Pacific invasion. Made me very proud of these Marines and also to be a free American in a country we time take for granted that it will always be a great country of freedom.

The portions of this season that cover the battles are excellent, and are worthy of 5 stars.  The battle portions really capture the horrors of war and should be applauded for that.  Those parts are as good as Band of Brothers.

Now, the parts I didn't like.  I understand that the R & R portions of the series are intended to accurately portray real life or capture the human side of things during this war, but those portions add a bit too much drama for my liking.  I won't cite any specific instances in case the reader hasn't watched this season yet, but there are some parts that are fluffy, and just do not belong in a series such as this.

Regardless, my criticism (for what it's worth i.e. not much) is minor compared to what you will experience from watching this series, it's required viewing for someone who is interested in World War II.",1420070400,,993,4.428571428571429

WW II was was totally brutal and hellish.  I wish our school system showed programs like this in their history classes.  Kids with their iPhones and social media don't comprehend those years.

Still, if this was your father or mother pulled into the war, they likely never talked about their experience and this series will give you a good glimpse at what they might have encountered...their first time seeing a person killed or maimed, their first time witnessing a friend losing a limb, their first gunshot or shrapnel wound, their first time in battle, their first time as not believing the inhumanity of the situation.  This was war, and even if the causes were somewhat justified due to Japan's or Germany's aggression, this was still war along with all of its brutality and it glamour now tarnished. This particular series follows the lives of a few main characters, from the southern protected child losing his innocence to the tough east coast buddies finding their immortality broken.  The shocking randomness is thrust upon the viewer much as it arrives to our characters.  Shrapnel and bullets have no real time frame and no real targets; they just arrive suddenly, unexpectedly, and you quickly discover that you are indeed far, far away with little hope of returning anytime soon.  Out of rations, out of water, out of toilet wipes, the war creeps down on you rapidly, making you as scared as your enemy and likely filled with the same thoughts of will you still be alive tomorrow.  This is ten episodes long and you'll likely take the first two episodes to decide if you're going to stick through it all;  but once into it, you're there for the duration, even when stopovers occur in Australia and back home.  The emotions are still mixed and you wind up asking yourself why you don't want things to end.  You do, of course, but you don't.  Perhaps you might watch this to see what you've missed no matter your age, or perhaps to instill a newfound respect for what those veterans went through, or perhaps simply because this was done with both quality and humility.  Five stars would have sounded arrogant, reserved for a few such as five-star generals and such.  But if this era makes you even a tiny bit curious, even as it fades from our memories and the last of the WW II vets pass on (they were dying at the rate of 1,000 per day due to their ages), then maybe take the time to pay tribute here.  You definitely will turn off the set with a new set of feelings.",1419984000,,2470,4.650574712643678

Men in Iwo Jima, jumped on grenades, thrown in their foxhole, to save their fellow combatants life. That is a love story. Men willing to die to save their friends. No greater love happens in this world, than that! So, these men saw the best and the worst of mankind.

This movie is devoid of any spiritual content, just as men have evolved from monkeys. America was not a simple secular nation then. It was a time Mr. Hanks and Spielberg would not understand, the times moral and religious perspective.

The emperor who was a Japanese God, saw America's God was greater than Japan's God. The emperor of Japan, after the war, asked for Christian Ministries, but we sent them Baseball and consumerism as our American religion. American's did not love the ""dirty Japs"" so maybe America was a ""post Christian"" country, back then. Christians are supposed to love their enemies and Japan was just that!",1419984000,,1082,4.538461538461538

1136306,5,6305837325,"I grew up in the 70's a Marine brat with my father serving 3 tours in Viet Nam before retiring at 20 years a GySgt.  I love the Corps and almost became an Marine Aviator in 1991.  All that being said, I am ashamed to say I knew very little of the Marine Corps role in WWII, aside from Iwo Jima.  I take responsibility for my ignorance, my fascination with the European theater war films, my ""guilt"" over Hiroshima, Nagasaki, internment camps and Hollywood's general ""glamorizing"" of the war in Europe.  However, I think some of the ""ignorance"" resides in the fact that combat experienced Marines do not tend to talk about themselves or what they do.  Because of this, I feel the very fact that every scrap of volcanic dirt on every god-forsaken island in the Pacific was nearly a D-Day type bloodbath in its own right has, for the most part, escaped Hollywood (and school textbooks)...until now.

This mini-series chronicles the very real transformation of young men and even older NCOs and officers.  The former from innocent, patriotic and brave to hardened, stoic, brutal and heroic Spartans.  Spartans who did not fight for glory, instead fighting for their country and comrades.  The latter from experienced trench warfare Devil Dogs of WWI, to the new breed of even more decisive, assertive and adaptable leaders.  Leaders who were now facing a ruthless, committed and patriotic enemy who were changing the nature of warfare as American Officers had known up to this point.  These Marines had to face a fanatical foe whom were fighting for their god ordained leader (sound familiar?) the likes of which was not being seen by the Allied forces in Europe.  I'm not downplaying the war in Europe, so please don't take offense, I had Uncles in Europe, with at least one in the very brutal Battle of the Bulge.

Maybe this series will help people understand the Esprit d Corps a bit more, understand why we need the USMC and why so many foreign armies fear our Leathernecks.  Even if the viewers don't glean new respect, this film provides a brutal, realistic look into the gritty reality of warfare.  A look that needs to be taken.  A view that has been lost in the modern age of drone strikes and smart bombs.  That grit is still there, even if we don't see it now.

Something happened to me after watching this series.  Something I never thought possible.  I respected and loved the USMC all over again.  Thank you Marines.  Thank you Dad.",1419638400,,2443,4.685446009389671

However, as the series unfolded my doubts quickly washed away. The ability of modern filmmakers to put you in the center of the action coupled with very human stories drawn from the memoirs of men who were there makes this well worth watching. I will say that ""The Pacific"" is certainly not for the faint of heart or those who don't want a BIG dose of reality in their viewing experience. But, if you're interested in gaining some vague sense of what the men and women who went through these times really endured, it's definitely worth watching.",1419552000,,800,4.889705882352941

1138565,1,6305837325,"What went wrong with Band of Brothers The Pacific? The European war version was fantastic. This series was horribly written, horribly directed and horribly acted. The storylines made absolutely no sense. I spent this week watching it on Amazon Prime. Spielberg and Hanks had an amazing opportunity to finally make a powerful big production modern movie-theme series about the WWII Pacific theater. Epic fail.

Let's start out with opening credits. Skip to 2:45 to pass them. Way too long. The first three episodes were boring. Character development and lines had zero effort in drawing me into any of the characters. None of these characters had a personality you would either love, hate or anticipate to know more. These were drone teleprompter readers, not actors. Their communication, thoughts and interaction was monotonous. I hoped most of these unknown actors would create a new generation of exciting movie stars and tv stars. Not the case here.

The storyline repeats back and forth through most episodes. Front line fighting. Incoming Japanese mortar shells taking out 1/2 of the platoon. Back to the ocean for R & R. Did I just see this? Yes, you did. About fifteen times. No Japanese soldier character development at all. They seemed like kindergarten puppeteer play with no rhyme or reason for their actions in the script. I realize there were three island conflicts which were focused, but each island had identical boring themes. How these characters fought the enemy, comradery, cope and personality change was not believable in the least. There was some kind of enjoyment by Spielberg/Hanks to bastardize medal of honor recipients and their patriotic mission to sell war bonds. Defamation of character. We got to hear one of the main characters discuss agent orange defoliating chemicals and the affects on people, yet it wasn't used until Viet Nam. After that, I was expecting global warming, overpopulation and health care issues to be raised by grunt WWII soldiers. I am so glad I did not buy this blu-ray set. It would have either gone in the garbage of dumped to someone I knew.

What to give credit?
-The movie did fine with historical 40's clothing, vehicles, buildings, scenery and props.
-Very authentic special effects in regards to explosions and body parts.

Overall this series felt like an anti-WWII movie.  I'm in denial that this series was made. It should have been scrapped and left to a new generation of film makers. Spielberg and Hanks failed miserably.",1418688000,7,2490,5.048661800486618

But this series, along with the other produced by the same likes, ""Band of Brothers"" leaves the viewer with compassion and respect for anyone you know that may have served in any war.

This series is well worth owning and replaying several times over.
Also, if you like the content of this series, I definitely recommend Band of Brothers.  As for movies, ""Flags of our Fathers"" and it's counterpart, ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" directed by Clint Eastwood.",1418601600,,602,4.872549019607843

1138732,5,6305837325,"The challenge for me was having viewed Band of Brothers my expectation for this series was pretty high. I have not watched the whole series yet. It seems to me the writers spent an unusual amount of time developing characters that didn't in my opinion enhance the story. Obviously I am no critic, but I do know what I like. I will of course watch the whole series with the hope it will pull me in. So far It's no Band of Brothers.

Well after viewing the series I must not only change my rating but my review as well. It is not Band of Brothers it is not intended to be. This is an extremely powerful series that tells the History and mission of the USMC in the Pacific like never before. It is graphic and horrible in so many ways. It should take the viewer to a place of awe and true gratitude for the terrible price our most precious treasure paid for all of us. A must see for all.",1418515200,,894,4.137931034482759

how far they actually would change while fighting tooth and nail for every inch of space

An excellent portrayal from relatively unknown actors giving a good depiction of what it must have been like fighting a fanatical Japanese army with true American grit and determination. Backed up by USAs ability to supply the tools to do the job. The film also showed the real meaning of shall I run left or right which actually meant will I be lucky and live today.

The movie was a pathetic representation of Sledgehammer's excellent book.  It's weird how they can't just take the perspective of the one who was actually there and put on the screen.  Instead they use the events, add some of their own and rewrite the perspective to, I guess, be their own (even though they weren't there).  The mini series stunk.

Colonial Chesty Puller was a much more interesting person then how he's portraited, he is a Medal of Honor recieptient, and reveared by all Marines. The story tells a little known fact that Marines aparently for many years had been using older equipment handed down from the army. It's the band of brothers in the Pacific threater of war.

1140553,5,6305837325,"When I first started watching this it was to try and better understand my husband who is a former marine.  Being that I am female, naturally I was quite taken by the emotional side of this series and the things these men went through mentally and emotionally on the battle field. I found it much more heart breaking at times to see the complete and total mental breakdown and deterioration of the guys who survived that is portrayed so well through this series than watching some of the guys lose their lives.

One emotion I wasn't expecting to feel came during times when I experienced feelings of guilt for having trouble dealing with the show emotionally  and yet being at home totally safe while the men in WWII were right in the middle of it. I was amazed with their ability to keep going knowing that they were probably going to die!

The greatest shock came to me at the very end of the series when I found out that all these men were real and many of the stories were real! I went through the ENTIRE series thinking they were all made of characters with made up stories of what happened during WWII.  Once again, I felt a sense of guilt for having not known anything about these guys prior to watching it, but I am so so grateful to the makers of this series as it has helped me to connect to my husband and the heroes of this country. The sacrifice they made is so far beyond just losing their lives and killing the ""bad guys.""

Thank you so much to all of you who have served our country. I am going to make it a requirement for all my kids to study the history of WWII and watch this series when they are old enough to handle it.",1417564800,,1640,4.240384615384615

1140636,4,6305837325,"The military accuracy was great in terms of Marine traditions and jargon. The historical accuracy, as best I could tell, was fairly accurate. While the combat scenes were close, some of the violence was made in an attempt to be TO graphic for shock value, as if the combat in the pacific wasn't violent enough in reality without embellishment. Coming a from a family of military who served in the pacific, and serving in the Corps myself, Im a bit taken aback at the heavy depictions of Marine atrocities and war crimes, and showing very little of the Japanese cruelty that was rampant in the pacific campaign against both civilians and military.  A little heavy on the side story romance distractions, but overall its a good series thats fairly accurate with great special effects and realism as long as the viewer keeps in perspective the fact the Marines are an Honorable force who did not commit  atrocities -as a general rule and matter of course -unless their hand was forced",1417478400,,981,4.764705882352941

There's no explanation of the strategy for the taking of Japan but offers the experiences at the level of company (sometimes), platoon, squad, and individuals both in battle and and between battles.

It's the best documentary of it's kind I've ever seen.

I am glad they do not hide the gore of the battlefield or the prolonged stress the combat marines / soldiers must endure in a surreal and insane kill or be killed environment.  The sex scenes are never necessary.  Good film to remind those who did not fight the Japs or grow up with those who did, that the Japs were a merciless and cruel enemy who absolutely refused to stop fighting even though they knew they were defeated.  Keep that in mind the next time you hear the Japanese whine about Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  They brought it onto themselves...  Likewise, the Germans brought the destruction of their country onto themselves. Both the Japs and Nazis murdered millions in unprovoked war and countless atrocities.

It was satisfying to see their stories fleshed out in dramatic narrative. I wish HBO had decided to leave out the sex scenes, but it's HBO.

With Tom Hanks being the execute director in this series how can you go wrong. The acting and the scenery, the blood and guts made one feel that you were in the battles. What made it so memorable is at the end when they showed the real solder that each actor was portraying and how they lived out their lives. Brought tears to my eyes that they were real people who not fought a gruesome war with Japanese and endured such hardships that is so hard to even imagine. Theses brave men didn't have much time to relax between going from one island to another. They fought under the bravest conditions, lack of water, food, ammunition, sleep and at times lack of Naval support. They were all brave, just that some were just a little more brave then others.

How did the US even know they were there? What was the importance of the battle? I never really got a sense of ""the mission"" (other than ""take the island""). For me it was presented on too micro a level for me to really get behind it. I also didn't feel the the incredible bond that was depicted in Band of Brothers.

1143690,1,6305837325,"This is what happens when liberals make war movies.

They managed to reduce the greatness of the US Marine to the base brutality of thugs and equate them with the barbarism of the Japanese forces. Scenes of stealing the gold teeth from dead(and in one case a living) Japanese soldiers mouth, brutally murdering Okinawans and defeated Japanese soldiers in order to destroy the decency of the America forces is pretty typical of the liberals desire to deny American exceptionalism.

The episodes were mostly boring with brief moments of interesting combat that was dampened by overly dark and un-followable action. Scenes of gore beyond what even the actual footage of the war ever showed were more for shock value like when one of the characters slips and falls face first into a mostly decayed corpse covered with maggots.

Moral judgments that clearly showed the Japanese to be superior to the Americans such as the comment made by one character that the Japanese dead were buried but not ""our guys"" and how the Japanese were too dedicated to surrender and how the marines were only taught to ""kill japs"".

Even the format was pathetic. Each episode started with two minutes and 45 seconds of opening credits and ended with close to four minutes more credits. During which you were treated to a totally inappropriate musical score (if the intent was to inspire) as it was more conducive to taking a nap.

This series was just a total disappointment in almost every way and an insult to the great marines who sacrificed so much. But then Hanks had a hand in it , so it's about what you would expect.",1415318400,8,1599,4.758122743682311

1143695,3,6305837325,"I do not understand why the makers of this episode have to have this kind of dialogue in Episode 9 before a battle.  Whats the point?  Is this an accurate portrayal of Marines in World War II in the Pacific Theater of the War?  Was this something typical among Marines in the same Platoon going into battle?  There is an extended dialogue of two marines treating another marine with deceit, exchange of new ponchos with an old and ratty one and other disrespectful dialogue as they march toward battle.  Finally the last disrespectful act is extremely offensive. One marine requests the picture of the disrespected marines wife so he can masturbate while holding the picture and imagine having sexual intercourse with this fellow marines wife.  This last part of the dialogue is portrayed with maximum offensiveness for the other marine.  It was as if the offensive marine was just begging to be attacked by the offended marine.  I wonder under those circumstances if the offended and disrespected marine could cause the other offending marine harm without being punished.
  I am a veteran of the U.S. Army.  Have been in different types of units including combat units but not in combat.  I have had the typical conversations with other buddies as we went to a new location.  I cannot imagine having this kind of offensive and deceitful dialogue with my buddies and not expect a severe falling out among all present.  Are the producers of this miniseries telling us this kind of offensiveness was typical as Marines approached battle in which they knew all would not be walking away from?
  Episodes like this during this great miniseries about the war in the Pacific was such a downer for me in enjoying it and learning from this miniseries.  Why does do such great and well known producers have this kind of dialogue in a miniseries when I would think every second is precious in the miniseries to portray the typical and usual actions, behaviors and typical thinking and beliefs of the commanders and the Marines or soldiers in the Pacific theater of World War II?  Every second of portrayal is precious in maximizing the information in this movie format for present generations of Americans to learn about and remember what life and existence was like for the American soldier in the Pacific Theater of World War II.

1144574,5,6305837325,"An excellent series. Some commented that areas of the series were boring, disjointing, or unnecessary; all are incorrect. The storyline does well to show how these individuals went from normal life to the absolutely unfathomable aspects of harsh combat and back to normal life with the expectations that they can turn their experiences on and off like a switch. Cinematography and character portrayal was excellent, allowing emotions to be conveyed to the viewer very well even all the way to a limited point of view of the Japanese. Historical accuracy was excellent throughout. When my children are old enough to fully understand everything being shown in the series I will ensure they watch it so they too can learn what occurred, even if only a slight piece of the war.

As a retired service member who never had to experience this kind of combat, I salute all who served in every theater of the war. We shall remember your sacrifice.",1414195200,,938,4.8625

1144841,2,6305837325,"Coming, as it did, on the heels of Band of Brothers, expectations were esp. high for this series.  Drawing from Eugene Sledge's extraordinary book, With the Old Breed, this series was rich with possibilities.  But, the writing, the acting, the directing, never matched the intensity and veracity of BofB.

The Pacific didn't follow Sledge's narrative like BofB did Ambrose's (yet, Sledge is one of the characters!?).  Much of the material feels like it comes from the scriptwriters' imaginations.  Soldiers act more like frat boys on a holiday than young men at war. The Japanese have one mode of attack throughout the series - charge headlong into a hail of bullets.  Half the episodes have no fighting and much of the story doesn't take place in THE PACIFIC, strangely.  No characters stand out like Captain Winters in BofB - they're all fictitious, after all - and so there's no old soldiers remembering what REALLY happened.

The expectations on the film makers to create another Band of Brothers must have been huge.  You feel them trying.  Too bad.",1413763200,4,1054,4.9375

I have written two books about the Vietnam War as well as my autobiography. I am also a Marine Corps historian currently working on a commemorative of the Marine Combined Action Platoons in the Vietnam War. Marine Captain (retired) Dale Dye has done a brilliant job of training the cast and crew as well as making the combat as real as it actually was. For those of us who wear the Eagle, Globe and Anchor, the story of hero and legend Jon Basilone finally brought us a face and a character to match this part of Marine Corps history we were all taught in boot camp. Jon Seda did an outstanding job playing Basilone and his portrayal will be remembered for a long time. There are nuances and characterizations in this series that only my fellow Marines would appreciate. My father served in the Pacific during WWII and I wish he had lived long enough to see this masterpiece of filming.

However, without richly developed characters, it's easy to get the feeling of apathy towards the whole series.  If you are considering watching this series, don't expect ""Band of Brothers"".

What war can do to a man, his mind, his character, his resolve, his worldview, his sense of honor and duty and self, his value of life and liberty and love -- all of these are on display and in the crucible in this film. And you can feel the harrowing emotional roller coaster upon which these men and women are carried. From Guadalcanal to the return home after the surrender of the Empire of Japan.

After reading a bit about the series, it's obvious they weren't trying to duplicate BoB. While the overall story-telling is a bit disjointed at times, this is still a 5 star watch. If for no other reason than the horribly realistic portrayal of mid 20th century infantry combat, and how that can be used to remind us in an age of ""The US military went to war. America went to the MALL."", in grisly detail, just how much our military and individual members have willingly sacrificed for us.

It's easy to just think of the military as one giant entity. ""Our military sacrifices for us."" But when you think of the individual marines, soldiers, airmen, and seamen, and how they chose a duty that could/did leave them and their family physically and/or emotionally damaged, that sacrifice takes on a much different meaning.

Thank you to all who have served. Thank you to each individual who may have a harder time living life, than if they hadn't served. Your individual sacrifice is recognized, appreciated, and will be honored.",1412640000,,1101,4.7539267015706805

1146555,5,6305837325,"Some of the scenes in this movie are so real, it's disturbing. The environments are amazing. CGI is almost undetectable.

There's a span of about 2-3 episodes early on that are somewhat less action-packed than I'm sure some people would like. I was worried while traversing those but it more than made up for it in the home stretch. In hindsight, I think they were worth having in place.

It follows the stories of three Marines over four battles in the Pacific Campaign. This version has an option for historical intros by Tom Hanks to set up each episode.

If you're a war junkie, you won't be disappointed. I don't know what to say much more than that. I would not recommend checking out any short clips on Youtube, it's better viewed in-context and harmonically because the story is well-written so that scenes have more meaning.",1411948800,,833,4.691780821917808

1146782,4,6305837325,"The Pacific is a well done mini series by HBO. The acting by Joe Mazzello, James Badge Dale, and Jon Seda is superb to say the least. The special effects and fight scenes are all well done. The show is also very accurate, showing everything from the uniforms of the Soldiers and Marines to actual events in specific detail. There  is some creative license HBO used here and there but the series is fairly accurate.
  The mini series follows the lives of three Marines (Robert Leckie, John Basilone, and Eugene Sledge) in the Pacific campaign. The show starts after Pearl Harbor and ends with the Marines coming home. The series is interesting and demonstrates how rough the Pacific theater was for the men who fought in it. It also makes you appreciate their sacrifice even more.
  For those of you expecting another Band of Brothers you may be sorely disappointed. Where Band of Brothers was about a unit of men, dealing with the horrors of war together. This is a bit different you have a study in what war does to men, the different reactions to the awfulness of it. The three main characters rarely if ever interact (some episodes of the series are entirely devoted to one character). This detracts from the centralization of the plot. While Band of Brothers was focused on the same group, sometimes The Pacific seemed a bit choppy and harder to follow. The characters are not as relatable either.
  A frequent complaint that I would like to address is that many found this series too violent. According to what I have read - this is what the war was like. It was not pretty. HBO did not pull any punches. There was one scene that was a bit over the top, but if you read Sledge's diary it is there. This is a typical HBO series in that there is a lot of violence, cursing, and scenes of a sexual nature. Just as a warning, make sure you do not give this to younger kids (Sands of Iwo Jima might be a good one for them). If you do, just be sure to watch it with them.
  If you enjoyed this I do have a few recommendations. Read Helmet for my Pillow by Robert Leckie, With the Old Breed by EB Sledge, and The Pacific by Hugh Ambrose. I would also recommend the films Flags of Our Fathers, Band of Brothers, The Great Raid, and The Big Red One.",1411344000,,2245,4.390361445783133

1146966,4,6305837325,"Well done series. A worthy accompaniment to the Band of Brothers series regarding the 101st Airborne in Europe. This, however, could arguably be said is a more bloody series. But they went to great lengths to get things historically as accurate as Hollywood might allow. Trouble is, they interject a love story right smack in the middle of the series that distracts you for several episodes. Just snaps you out of the ""war flick"" you thought you were watching in a rude manner. At least, that's how it struck me. Especially when they have another side story following a Marine who was taken for hospital evaluation and you have that going on at another point. Could have just stuck with the one side story.

Pretty faithful to those books for the most part (am rereading E. B. Sledge now) and certainly makes graphic the unremitting horror of war and the Pacific war in particular. Much more gritty and intense than Band of Brothers but then again the story only focusses on 3 people rather than the 12-15 main Easy Company soldiers. The story and cinematography are first rate.

1147433,5,6305837325,"Anytime you try to thread three separate plot lines (Leckie, Sledge, & Basilone) into a 10 part mini series it will have cohesion problems as many have pointed out. BOB had numerous historical errors and I think Hanks and Spielburg took more time researching the facts before going to production filming of this series. In my opinion ""The Pacific"" told a better story without relying on an expensive and larger cast with the bigger name actors Band of Brothers had cast (Lewis, Livingston, Schwimmer, Colin Hanks, and a lesser known at the time Tom Hardy and Jamie Bamber). So sure ""The Pacific"" has connection issues with certain viewers, but it still prevails story wise.

Still ""The Pacific"" series reminded me of the tone of of the Terrence Malik film ""Thin Red Line"" (met with mixed reviews) with similar camera angles, temperament and slow degrade of combat on individuals in the Pacific theatre. My only complaint was the Battle of Alligator Creek (Tenaru, Battle of the Ilu River) was very very abbreviated, as it was 3 or 4 attacking waves of Colonel Ichiki's 28th Infantry Regimental combat teams that were eventually turned back and waited in respite east of the creek, the Marines finally counterattacked in the morning and eventually brought in M3 tanks to ultimately finish off the remaining Japanese forces. This major psychological US ground victory in the early stages of the Pacific theatre that should have been accurately put onto the film and documented to specific facts while this location, cast, and equipment were available. Instead the scene portrays a usual economic driven night fight (Leckie moving his machine gun in time) and an epilogue morning execution of what was the film director wanted us to believe to be the defeated Colonel Kiyonao Ichiki flailing in frustration and anger and alone in the water. This scene should have been more accurate to honor the grit of soldiers demonstrated on August 21st, 1942, but it lacks character.",1410825600,,1968,5.0

I think HBO needs to calm it down on the vulgarity and sexual content and realize that men didn't act the way back then as they do now. I think BoB was a much more accurate representation of that. They respected each other and respected their enemy and they knew how to be loyal friends to one another. I couldn't get into the characters as much in this series as BoB, they just weren't memorable. At times I even found myself rooting for the Japs, ant that a hoot.

I believe they learned their lesson with less praise/awards compared to BoB and ""Masters of the Air"" will have more integrity and respect for our WW2 veterans, or at least I hope.",1410652800,,703,4.366412213740458

1147847,5,6305837325,"The series t'was most excellent. It starts with the reaction to Pearl Harbor by the American public. Proceeds with the 1st Marine Division, through the end of the war with VJ day. It is a character study with several different characters from different backgrounds. The backgrounds are mostly ethnic, while some social levels thrown in. This is not your war film of the 40's, but a harsh look at up close and personal killing. Some of the segments display American soldiers with less charming behaviors the propaganda films would dare to illustrate. Judging on the stories that I heard from my father and uncles it seems pretty credible. There were no glamor stars (talking Barbie and Ken's). The only two stars that I recognized were from Law and Order, and Hawai'i 5 O. This lack of glitter added to the realism of the blood, mud, and  destruction. This is an illustration for the people whom need to be coached in why so may of our veterans are having trouble returning to the ""world.""  WW2 was considered a ""just"" war, as opposed to the ""corporate asset protection"", and ""oil interests"" of the wars of late.

1147959,5,6305837325,"The Band of Brothers special is a good benchmark to determine whether or not you would like the Pacific.  Big differences in terms of plot development is that Band of Brothers takes the first couple episodes to really develop the characters, and each episode begins with the actual real life people who the characters are based on.  In The Pacific, you are immediately thrust into the heat of the action in the first episode, and for me at least, the main characters were not immediately determinable.  Nevertheless, The Pacific is an emotionally heavy show to watch.  It is difficult to sit through scenes of heavy bombardment where soldiers are dying and understand what the pacific front of WWII was actually like.

This series displays this concept repeatedly to the point the viewer becomes numb to it.  This is how most marines and any combat soldier becomes after seeing so much senseless gore.

1148474,3,6305837325,"I'm divided.  I know it's entertaining.  I know the production values are fantastic.  But after Band of Brothers, and happening to be a WWII buff, I know just enough about the pacific theater to realize that the portrayal of American combat troops is wrong.  Atrocities happened on both sides, of course, but far more so by the Japanese.  Their soldiers were intentionally dehumanized and were every bit as vicious as they have ever been made out to be, yet it is the Americans that seem to come across as savages.  Ann odd PC retelling of the Japanese war. Disappointing.  It felt like the producers jumped on Obama's American apology tour.",1410307200,,641,4.7727272727272725
1148475,1,6305837325,"I really was expecting something here... but it was really in the end a waste of time. I'm truely shocked that I even finished it. The story is very disjointed all around bouncing between the various marines with the most run of the mill dialogue. Most of it usually centered around how can I be a jerk or how can I get a girl. They do very little to actually endear you to any of the marines or their challenges.

Rather the majority of the series seems centered around the gore. Yes, I know it is a war series and violence go hand in hand but it felt far more like it was the only point and it was never well done. Every time they try to show a soldier losing heart, having internal conflict, or flipping out it is so very very forced.

Which leads me to the biggest problem of the series. It's trying to shove romances in multiple times while heavily trying to jam scene in after another for some political point that was is bad and nearly all the marines in the Pacific were royal dicks that would happily gun down entire legions of Japanese even if they surrendered all while savaging each other again and again and again. Which leads to the whole thing being woefully repetative. Unless you just like shoddy romance with 'the feels' jammed in with constant gore like it's trying to be some b rated horror movie this series is so very lackluster.",1410134400,2,1351,4.357142857142857
1148476,5,6305837325,"I can't give enough kudos to this series. I was so deeply involved in it. It felt like I was there at times. War is hell they say. I used to have a vision of the tropical beaches and the swaying palm trees of the South Pacific but the Marines didn't have any of that. Seems like it was a rare day when they weren't slogging through mud and a torrential downpour. I got emotionally connected with the Marines and was extremely glad to see the recap at the end of the series telling me what happened to them after the war. Glad to see that the one fellow's Australian girlfriend (Florence) came to the States and married him. I was afraid it wouldn't happen. All in all, a terrific series. I've never seen BOB so I guess that will be next for me. Also hoping someone has done credit to Vietnam. Would like to see that also.

I still don't think we respect what happened enough.  Our society tries to tie in today's soldiers with the heroic deeds of the past, in order to justify wars in the middle east and Vietnam for political/monetary gain.  The reality of the mental suffering of a soldier is real, and the suffering of those who were DRAFTED to save the entire WORLD from totalitarian control is unfathomable.

Was not the same type of series Band of Brothers was.  Was a bit darker, and a bit more realistic.  Bother series are A+, and do well to tell the story of the limitless suffering soldiers endured during WW II.

I have a big interest in WWII and I can't think of another movie or series that so closely depicts reality as this series does. One can easily see how those in the military return from combat having to deal with PTSD for long periods, perhaps the rest of their lives.

Casting was well done, the acting and direction were superb.

If you have not watched this series prepare yourself for all of the disturbing things that happen in war, especially that of foot soldiers involved in fire fights. There is also sex scenes, nudity, and language so this is not a series for young people. But in spite of those things I encourage you to watch this series.

1150769,3,6305837325,"I was a big fan of Band of Brothers, so was pleased when Amazon Prime made The Pacific available.  The series certainly makes clear the grueling nature of the war in the pacific and its impact on the soldiers, but, unlike B OF B, I never really cared for most of the characters, except for John and Lena Basilone.  This is probably because the series spends considerable time developing their characters outside the war zone.  We see most of the characters most of the time in chaotic battles or tropical downpours, which made it difficult most of the time to even recognize who was who.  I came away with renewed admiration for the many, many men I grew up with who served and never talked about their experiences, but without having developed a real relationship with the characters.",1408579200,,785,4.666666666666667

1150772,4,6305837325,"It is not Band of Brothers, but it is good. Band of Brothers seemed to have a more complete narrative that followed the people better. It was easier to really start to feel a connection with the people and the story of the war. There was also a better flow through the war. The Pacific seemed to get stuck on just a few battles and there was a lack of progression.

The Pacific was also more graphic than Band of Brothers. This might have been in part due to the differences between the two theaters of war. But it seemed that the director took this series to a much darker place in general.

It is worth watching in part because there is such a lack of really good films and series of the battle in the Pacific. Most people focus on the war in Europe.",1408579200,,752,4.179310344827586

The stories were real, and Tom Hanks did an excellent job directing how to tell them in a respectful, thought-provoking way. It was slightly over-produced in my opinion, but what can you expect from HBO? There needs to be some glory and romance to get it on the screen it seems, but the focus was clearly the battles that the marines were fighting, and most of those battles were not against the 'Japs'.

1150904,5,6305837325,"Excellent storyline, realistic action.  One of the better war movies that captures the essence of combat and the lives of soldiers, airman, and Marines.",1408406400,,152,5.333333333333333
1150905,3,6305837325,"I really wanted to love this series. Band Of Brothers was extremely cohesive and ""tight"". It told a compelling story and didn't blanch at telling and showing the horrors of war. It was well written and well acted, a worthy extension of what ""Saving Private Ryan"" started - the hyper realism of war.

And while The Pacific followed a similar model, produced by the same team, it somehow falls flat. There is too much distracting inclusion of things that I really didn't need to see (pointless nudity). Or hear. I question the overly liberal use of the F word. Was it used? Probably, it was just beginning to find its way into our daily vocabulary, but usually only in the lower echelons of society. But the degree it is employed here, it became too much a distraction in the dialogue. I would ask someone who was actually there if this word was so freely employed at that time.

Granted, the ""downtime"" of the soldiers was important to include, but some of the situations were uncomfortable to watch, not because they were difficult situationally, but because the drama seemed awkward and forced, not a natural part of the narrative.

The cinematography was great, staging was great, accuracy was generally good, insofar as equipment and tools and the like. So visually, it was very convincing (which is important to me, anyway). The scripting was sometimes clumsy and seemed incomplete.

What I really missed was the interviews with soldiers who actually fought in the battles. Band of Brothers had interviews with soldiers who lived it. Here we get only dramatization. At the end we find the actors were portraying real people, which I think is important, and so we understand the things they endured, that we watched, happened. And what they endured oftentimes was more than anyone should ever have to endure.

I watched the whole series, hoping it would find traction and be more. But while it did not live up to BoB quality and compelling narrative, I am glad the show was made. It may be the last telling of the Pacific story of the war that is ""accurate"". That accuracy includes very uncomfortable acts on both sides of the conflict, which today would be considered war crimes, not to denigrate American soldiers, and to further re enforce why the Japanese forces needed ""killing"", but because it is an inevitable part of war in general.

We ask young men to go to war. To kill the enemy that is going to try to kill them. At some point, many young men stray into the grey area of what is acceptable behaviour and conduct during battle, even in the immediate aftermath of battle. It's easy for someone who has never been in battle to point fingers and say ""war crime"". It is not so easy to ask our brave young men to conduct themselves in accord with the ""rules of war"" or ""conventions"", whatever that means to politicians. A soldier is given a job to do, it gets messy, very messy.

In ""Saving Private Ryan"", BoB and The Pacific, we see men step into the grey, even into the black. As difficult as it is to watch, to understand that it indeed happened, we have to let compassion and mercy be our guides. Consider that as you watch this and the other films on the subject. Forgiveness must be the place from which we operate, having asked our young to endure that which no man should ever have to suffer.",1408406400,,3310,4.619047619047619

1150968,5,6305837325,"An amazing journey!

A large swath of the story in these DVDs is drawn from ""With the Old Breed"" by Eugene Sledge (itself a 5-star book), with some 'artistic' interpretation.  These 10 1hr episodes show the pacific war in all of its terrible reality, Like Saving Private Ryan, at the end you're not the same person.

The extras on the DVDs gave me hours of fascinating background information. Period videos, comments from the veterans portrayed in the series, historian commentary, text blurbs.  The only problem I had was the picture-in-picture special feature.  Since it replaces the sound on the episodes when it kicks in, you have to watch each episode twice.",1408406400,,663,4.936936936936937

1150970,4,6305837325,"I really like this series, however, I give it a 4 star only because the viewpoint is somewhat slanted toward the Marine Corp having given more than the Army and that the Marines were THE superior fighting force.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  The Marines certainly were a superior fighting force, and when used in conjunction with tactical army amphibious units, such as was the case on Okinawa, the Army and the Marines were UNSTOPPABLE.  We have a lot to be proud of in the Marine Corp, but the Army too played a crucial role and also gave its share of blood to defeat the Japanese.  This series doesn't do justice to the fact that our amphibious forces were not just Marines, but Army too.  So, for that reason only, I give it a 4 star rating.",1408406400,,758,4.424460431654676

I had a little trouble following the lives of so many main characters, and got confused about who was doing what at times, but this series was still something that registered with me as imnportant to try and understand.

1151145,5,6305837325,"I knew Bob Leckie as did my entire family. My Mom who will be 99 within the month was Elizabeth Leckie's (one of Bob's older sisters) best friends growing up in Rutherford, NJ and spent many a day at their home on Carmita Ave. and up at their summer  lake house at Lake Erskine, NJ.

I read the book first  ""Helmet for my Pillow""  and the TV series could not describe how bad it was for the marines. It rained every day and night and they were bombed every night.  I enjoyed the show for many reasons including learning about John Basilone who's home town, Raritan, NJ, was only about 35 miles from mine.

Eugene Sledge, what can you say about him. He was one tough character. All the characters  in Leckie's group and Sledges you really got to know them and respect each one.

 It was special for all our alumni from St. Mary's High School, Rutherford, NJ.  Ironically Bob Leckie's Dad would not let him play football in HS but he ended up in hand to hand combat in the mud on those muddy, crab and rat infested terrible islands.

In the beginning I felt they spent too much time to get each episode going and they ended to quick. However; as I watched it over a few times I did learn to appreciate what each marine went through and felt that was an important part of the series.

In closing I felt James Badge Dale did a great job playing Leckie. Joseph Mazzello as Eugene Sledge along with Jon Seda who played John Basilone. They all did a terrific job. I am very happy that the producers of Play - Tone finally did the marines in the Pacific who sacrificed so much for us.

Also, according to this version, ""The Pacific"" didn't have the Army or Army Air Corps (sorry Richard Bong, top WW-II American Ace), and the Navy only had a supporting role.

I thought it did just as well, better in some ways, as Band of Brothers did in portraying the individuals and units involved.

Then, when episode 3 aired to give us some relief from all the jungle carnage, we went to Melbourne Australia for R and R, and what became non stop humping and bumping of all the Aussie babes by a bunch of sloppy, undisciplined, amoral, horny drunks that are supposed to be our fine American soldiers.  That was disgusting, exaggerated, and typical of American movie makers. If you don't have a plot, just throw in the sex and you've got a money-maker.  The Pacific theatre of WW2 has been so neglected, this could have been a good historical drama and a good balance to the Nazi plague in Europe.

I try to watch both series at least once or twice every year, just to remind me of the sacrifice that my parents generation went through.  Today's wars seem puny compared to the effort of the 40s.
The Pacific offers war at its worst.  The Pacific war really was different from the European war.  Brutality was commonplace, expected, and everyday.  The series depicts the war in all it's brutality.
Watch this series.  The special effects are incredible.......you'll think you are there.  Turn the sound way up in the battle scenes.  The acting is superb.  The characters are real men who really did what is depicted.",1407888000,,854,4.827586206896552

Lead characters are well drawn, especially that of Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone, Medal of Honor winner for actions during the battle for Guadalcanal.  Repeated camera shots at American servicemen stabbing, bayoneting and shooting live Japanese servicemen appeared overdone.  The film's main producer appears to look for some American outrageous behavior in all his war movies.  It was a great story of the battles for Japanese held islands and how American servicemen won those battles  Their heroism should not be mudded up with personal likes or dislikes.

1152038,5,6305837325,"Not sure if it's because my dad was in the fifth marine division in the pacific war that the show seemed so flawless to me. He never, ever, spoke about any of what happened and the one story I heard was from a friend who also in the fifth, who told me about it after my father had passed away. It was a shocking story. This show made it all seem real. What hit hard was how the acting and I looked for mistakes, a gaze held too long, a line carelessly delivered, a lack of conviction in expression, was amazingly consistent and authentic feeling. A masquerade of mastery. The dialogue was beyond artistic, it felt like exactly what people would say in that situation. With that perspective, the delivery of the experience for the viewer, witnessing what recorded history reveals to have happened to those marines is utterly visceral. The sixties had a phrase which described the effect of too many drugs on the human brain. MInd Blown. In many ways, what is portrayed in the movie explains what he must have seen some of, or been a part of, but never spoke about.",1407888000,,1063,4.456410256410257

1152127,2,6305837325,"Compared to the brilliant Band of Brothers, I was really disappointed by this series. Historical accuracy was probably pretty good, but the characterization--with a few exceptions--was pretty lacking. While in Band of Brothers each character seemed distinct and well-developed, the characters and acting here seemed flat. The standouts were Rami Malek as Snafu and James Dales as Leckie.

1152128,5,6305837325,"Gritty, brutal, and unrelenting, 'The Pacific' takes an unflinching look at the Pacific Theater of Operations in World War II.  All due respect to the heroes whose story is told in 'Band of Brothers', you won't find the same sometimes-sanguine tone or bon homme in 'the Pacific'.While 'Band' focuses on the bond formed between men thrown into the cauldron of war (a bond that in many ways is responsible for their emotional survival), 'The Pacific' concerns itself with the psychic damage done to the individual soldier in the PTO.
Perhaps it was due to how different the environment was, or maybe how different the Asian enemy differed both physically and mentally from them,  but regardless of the reasons why, 'The Pacific' focuses on exactly how traumatic the experience was from the point of view of three Marines on the front lines of the conflict.
As far as a film in its own right, 'The Pacific' is every bit the equal of 'Band of Brothers'. As a chronicle of the events it depicts, it appears to be accurate.  (It's primary source are accounts from two Marines: ""U.S. Marines: With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa"" by Eugene Sledge; and ""Helmet for My Pillow"" by Robert Leckie.  Two other books served as source material in part as well.  Parts of Bastilione's tale are taken from a secondary source.)  As a conveyance for a potent and hard-bitten story about the war as fought by Marines across various islands dotting the South Pacific... well, it is emotionally raw and certainly memorable (or at least I found it to be).
I would highly recommend 'The Pacific', especially to those that have watched 'Band of Brothers'; it not only provides an account of what was happening in the other Theater, but it also offers an account of the war on a more personal level, from soldiers who did not have a close-knit group of men immediately available to provide them support in dealing with the horrors they faced.",1407715200,,1923,4.75975975975976

I believe it to be a brutally honest depiction of WWII in the Pacific, and it's not for the faint of heart. I am glad to have seen it, and followed the episodes eagerly, as I never knew who would live or die. It's very well-done. However, I found it just confusing enough to not give it 5 stars. Perhaps we're supposed to feel off-kilter and confused, just like the men in the action, but I found that I spent some time figuring out who the characters were each time. Perhaps that's just me, and I needed to be paying closer attention. One of the best things about this series is that it doesn't end with the end of the war, rather, the final episode shows the surviving men and their families struggling with the changes in themselves and the world around them. It certainly reminds one of the long-lingering effects of any war, and the struggle to come to terms with all of these inner and outer transformations.",1407715200,,1082,4.415

Women and Men who believed in their country with all their hearts and souls and had the faith of Job that entering the war was the right thing to do. Good people for the most part. I believe that to be pretty close to how it was then, for the most part.  The actors, every single one of them was invisible. I could only see the characters they portrayed. I've never seen that before. The Pacific took me to a time I'd never been to, showed me an innocence in people and communities that I (I realized some people mistake for ignorance) will never experience.

1152395,2,6305837325,"Clearly not to the standards of The Band of Brothers production, and an obviously slanted view of U.S. Marines. Very scant attention is shown of Japanese atrocities against soldiers in the field, barely a second or two showing of headless torsos, but great detail of digging out gold teeth from the dead enemy. Not just once, but repeatedly. Very biased view of what was really taking place on those islands.

And the filming was atrocious. Too many close in shots during action scenes, too much movement of the camera, made many scenes blurry and hard to understand, even though I am well read on these battles.

I expected much better production values from the likes of Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg. Lucky they got two stars from me on this series.",1407628800,,753,4.740458015267175

The Pacific focuses the viewers' attention on two main characters, rather than the unit as a whole, and puts, in my opinion, much too much emphasis on the non-combat / romantic story during the first half of the season.

It is good television, but when inevitably compared to the superb Band of Brothers it unfortunately fails to achieve the same levels of awe, immersion, and emotional investment.",1407628800,,508,5.108433734939759

This series has none of that and even shows no situation maps during American briefings to the officers and non-coms before any offensive--just ""Hold that ridge above the airfield with ""X"" Co and we'll try to relieve you.  No mention of why Halsey left Guadalcanal in the lurch, etc.  So, very poor from a historical perspective in my opinion.

The series brought back my reading and mental visualizations of what was written and stayed true to the account of the experiences of these two great men who not only endured and we're lucky to survive some of the.most vicious battles ever fought but came back and we're heroes by becoming a scientist in the case of E.B. Sledge and a tremendous writer in the case of Andrew Leckey. And also important, the account of the experiences of the men they served with. It brought it all to the surface - insanity of war, personal fear, courage, suffering of the Marines and Japanese soldiers and civilians. The scene of E.B. Sledge holding that woman that wanted him to shoot her, who was wounded by E.B. Sledge's expert mortar fire direction earlier in the battle, until she died in his arms made me cry tears as I watched it. What a tremendous series this was. All these guys are leaving us now and it honors all who lived thru those times in other operations too and leaves a true account of the Pacific Campaigns and most importantly the experiences of the individuals who had to get that dirty awful job done and paid the price with their lives, bodies, and minds. Just as our young men have had to do numerous times since then and now with this Fundamentalist Moslem menace. Bless them tell them you care.

1153344,5,6305837325,"I have appreciated Tom Hanks as an actor but now have seen a number of his productions as director. He really knows how to hone in on the inner wounds and terror that these soldiers felt as they battled against the enemy. Often without a lot of words, just the looks on the actors faces as they watch their friends and innocent civilians die (the elder woman on Okinawa in the hut) tell more than anything else could.

It is hard to watch at times and probably only approximates the bitterness and struggle to survive in battle, but it makes me wonder how much longer we can continue to go to war, even for good causes, without reaping the whirlwind of grief and anger, losing our souls and humanity in the process.

I recommend the series highly as a testament of gratitude to those who fought, lost their lives, and bore the terrors of battle in silence. In recent years, I have had opportunity to talk with WWII vets and more recent war vets who truly anguish over their participation in the taking of lives. We need to support these men and women who walk among us with physical wounds and deeper emotional wounds.",1407196800,,1118,4.4754901960784315
1153345,5,6305837325,Excellent movie. It conveyed the long term conditions and the toll for those that fought the war.  The reaction of those who had been in heavy fighting when a new recruit talked about mowing down the Japs like a turkey shoot was spot on. You could see the pain and horror reflected in their faces.  They had felt the same way before they actually had to kill that many men.  You wonder how any of them came back sane.

1153422,5,6305837325,"This was my second time to watch this series.  I watched it the first time when it was released on DVD.  Probably one of the more important things to know, for anyone who isn't familiar with this series is, like its predecessor ""Band of Brothers"" it is based on the members of one military unit during the second world war.
  In this case, it is a unit of U.S. Marines that we follow from their individual homes across the country to the invasion of Guadalcanal, throughout the war in the Pacific, and to their eventual return to their homes, at least for those who would return.  The value of both series is to put a human face and experience on a history which most living people only know from school, if it was taught at all in other than passing mention.  It was this experience of those people that helped make the United States what it is and what it was.
  There were a lot of differences between the Pacific and the European theaters of war but central to the experience was that the soldier in Europe fought the war within the context of a familiar social structure.  One aspect of that was that when the soldier went on whatever R&R was afforded, it was within a somewhat more comforting venue than that experienced by soldiers in the Pacific Theatre.  There was nothing familiar or comforting about the jungles of the Pacific.",1407196800,,1338,4.491735537190083

For example, I've read quite a few war novels and seen quite a few war movies, but I didn't remember even hearing of the Battle for Peleliu, an island of about eight square miles that was the Marines' bloodiest battle. If you spend half an hour reading about each battle on Wikipedia before watching the given segment of the program, you'll notice a lot more and understand why it's happening.

This series is realistic in many aspects, especially the scenes of combat and the images of the war dead. If anything, it did not capture the cacophony of combat enough, it is the most noisome of environments. Confusion, stress and fear are your constant companions. Losing comrades that are as close to you as a lover was always devastating since most of them wee fellas you knew from bootcamp.. After awhile, you did not want friends or even know the names of the replacements that filled in the holes that your buddies once occupied. I mention all of this cause the series portrayed many of the emotions that combat soldiers and Marines felt. If anything, they were not expansive enough on the effects the war had after they came home. The nightmares and night sweats. Calling out a buddies name or how certain things would bring back the experiences they suffered during combat. Any Veteran of combat know what I speak of and they really can't explain to someone that has not been thru what they have been thru. As a Veteran of war myself, it was difficult for me to watch this and Band of Brothers. I did so to honor my 18 Great Uncles who fought in WW II and my Grandfather who was at Pearl Harbor 7 December 1941.

There were scenes of sexual encounters between two of these men and the women they loved that left little to nothing to the imagination which marred the story, but were a part of their lives - it didn't have to be as graphic as it was protrayed.

Theaters of war can change but the loss of life will remain the same. There are also some pretty explicit sex scenes so I wouldn't recommend this movie be seen by children.

BoB nuanced through the horror of war and emotions of the men of the 101st Airbourne, The Pacific failed to make the characters feel real and therefore make us care about their fate.

The video spared somewhat its viewers the terror they faced in an enemy, who wanted nothing more of his life than killing as many of his enemy as possible.  The warfare between the ridges, the rain, the decomposition of the dead, who could not be removed due to the intense action and frightful nights, when the enemy would infiltrate and kill sleeping gi's, or the firefights caused by men, who had to leave their foxhole to relieve themselves, and were killed by friendly fire.

 Now to get picky: perhaps too much use of  M-1 carbines compared to M-1 Garands (if you are counting); battle scenes are tough to do well and expensive, so was not surprised with some cheesy animation, particularly of airplanes; some if not several battle scenes seemed to show Marines fighting pitched battles with no ground or naval artillery support, or air support, or tank support (sure it happened some times); and several scenes of Marines moving thru war zones in a pretty nonchalant, casual manner and stopping out in the open rather than in cover.

Besides the battle scenes which  conveyed a breathtaking experience of the sheer luck of survival under the most intense conditions imaginable, the scenes between battles in Australia, the US, or just taking a break with a cigarette were a welcome relief to the viewer as well as the Marines.  Unlike their fellow soldiers who got leaves in the European theater as the Allies moved towards Berlin, the Marines were never really able to take a leave unless they were sick or wounded.  These men were real heroes, none more so than John Basilone whose exploits at Guadacanal left even his comrades in arms slack jawed in admiration.  Every episode is a gem and the whole series is a landmark of the power and beauty of the best cinema.  Highest marks to HBO and Spielberg and Hanks!!",1405555200,,878,4.743421052631579

1157030,2,6305837325,"Just finished ""The Pacific"", and I tend to agree with some of the 1 ratings. It most likely fails for me, because I just also watched the entire ""Band of Brothers"" series (which I will rate a 5). I heard Tom Hanks talking about making this series and he made a statement that made me swear I would never watch anything he ever worked on again. He said that WWII was a ""racist war"". I never really understood how he came to that conclusion, but after watching this I can see some of his attempt to portray that. At some point I started to wonder if I was watching ""The Pacific"" or ""Platoon"". Hollywood is infected with people who believe every action the United States has ever taken was done with only evil intentions, while completely ignoring any other possible reasons. With Hanks ""racist"" comment he would have us forget all about Pearl Harbor, and have you believe we simply invaded Japan for no reason. The only thing I did get from this series was some semblance of what soldiers suffer through during war.

Skip this series and watch ""Band of Brothers"".",1405555200,,1061,4.526041666666667

The story was more than enough to follow and could be left to flesh out over a few more seasons..but flashbacks from here would be tiresome.

It is amazing to understand that the Japs were a determined enemy, in fact so much so that they really didn't care if they lived or died as long as they killed American soldiers.

So well done with grippingly brutal and heart-wrenching realism, fantastic characters (true-life stories here folks) and superb production values make both of these series must see for any young-adult on up. True to the battles that waged in the ""other"" side of the world, The Pacific pulls no punches in showcasing the brutality and horror of war, and actually takes it even higher than Band of Brothers, which is saying something. You will fall in love with most of the characters (fantastically portrayed, acted and directed in each episode), and you WILL be crushed at what WWII threw at them and how it affected them, their families and our nation. Truly monumental. A must see companion to B of B. Bravo!!

My only complaint is that HD instant streaming with Amazon leaves A LOT to be desired.  Horrible picture quality constantly invaded every episode, especially during the action scenes, and really got it the way of enjoying this series. I have excellent performance with Netflix and Vudu, etc, so I am certain it has to do with how Amazon manages their content delivery. Amazon better get this sorted out especially as they are raising the price of a Prime membership quite a bit.

After watching it and comparing it to Band of Brothers, I tend to believe this war was mentally and physically worse on the soldier. I can't imagine having to deal with Mother Nature as well as the war. Extreme heat, humidity and the long periods of heavy rain. That within itself would be psychologically unbelievable! This movie will reveal the horrors of war as well as what mother nature can throw at you. It shows how we deal with death as well. Everyone us of will react in different ways to the horrific aftermath of war. I would like to thank all who served our country from the bottom of my heart under these conditions. I know there is no love lost for the Japanese soldier who fought for his country but he loved his country the same. He was a very cruel soldier but we would have to admire his dedication and devotion to his country as well.

It is, nonetheless, a hagiography of the 'Great War', by which I mean that it only very subtly questions - everyone is so sure of the 'rightness' of the cause & unaware of being propagandized  - even as it depicts troops who are literally in rags.

Were we really so naive then, or is this depiction just a fairy tale with swear words? The lives are noble, the deaths are noble, the atrocities understandable, the enemy implacable.

1157734,3,6305837325,"When making a war movie or TV show it's important to make memorable characters and get the audience attached to them, More so than any other kind of story because in a WW2 setting all the characters are far to similar and just sort of blend together. You can get away with introducing a zillion characters and constantly jumping all over the place in Game Of Thrones because there are enough differences to tell people and places apart.

But you can't get away with that sort of thing when all your characters are a bunch of generic white dudes, committing war crimes, having mental breakdowns, losing their innocence, shooting things, and running places. They are all in their early 20's, in similar uniforms, and always in a rocky jungle area. Everyone has the same character motivation (not getting shot, and hooking up with Australian women).

In a setting like that you can't introduce a character and then drop them for 3 episodes. Or skip between people fighting in the mud, then skip to a hospital, then skip to the US, then skip to different people fighting in different mud.

Also I know this is a war story and they tend to do this sort of thing, but every Japanese character got to shout one line in a language the audience can't understand, and then about 5 seconds of screen time before falling over or exploding in a shower of blood. I know well developed antagonists aren't really a priority for war movies or TV shows, but the sharks in Sharknado got more character development than all of Japan did in the Pacific.

The Pacific has some of the most memorable ""War is Hell"" scenes of anything on TV, but everything else is a blur.",1405209600,,1647,4.591836734693878

It is a long and brutal series that studies the effects that combat has on Marines during the island campaigns. The level of detail is impressive and the grim look of the life of a combat infantryman is intense and extremely accurate. This film series presents the Marines as they really looked after living outdoors and being ravaged by bacterial borne disease. The actors who protrayed real individuals who served in the Marines during these campaigns performed excellently. They looked like normal individuals instead of the typical movie stars that one sees in most movies. I would strongly recommend this series to anyone who is interested in this important part of World War II, however prepare yourself for intense violence and brutality which are common elements of warfare.",1405209600,,876,4.965986394557823

The psychological and physical agony of war is evident in all of the scenes.  War seems to bring out things we are all capable of doing both horrendously evil and bravely heroic.

1157963,5,6305837325,"I was very impressed with the quality of this series.  Look at the producers and you can see why.
If you want to go further into this, then you can buy the book E.B. Sledge wrote about his time in the Pacific.  It is something
so well written and acclaimed that you will treasure it.  The title of his book is, ""With the old Breed from Peleliu to Okinawa"".
His book tells how Marine historians say that Peleliu was the most difficult battle the Marines fought in the war.  The series took many of the characters in the book and feature them in the series.  The series is an ""thumbs up"" for me, but the book is something else.  If you liked this war story on t-v, then the book is a must read for you.  It is readily available on Amazon.com in paper back as well as the kindle edition (which I downloaded).",1405123200,,805,4.188311688311688

But I understand. We've got to include the females now in everything, absolutely everything, no matter how irrelevant they are to the plot. But it's damn boring. All it does is slow the plot down. There was plenty of human interest in Band of Brothers. But it was all relevant to advancing the plot by the relationships of the men fighting. In Pacific the females were a distraction.

1158141,3,6305837325,"This is an interesting series.  It has some compelling moments, but it is not as gripping as Band of Brothers, or the documentary series The World at War.  Still, it does portray the war in the Pacific in a more complete manner than other things I have seen.  While some of the episodes that focus on the life of the Marines when they are between battles, those sections seem to be overlong.  An entire episode about the way the Marines rested up, played, and interacted with civilians in Australia gave some interesting insights, but probably not enough for an entire hour.  The battle scenes are graphic, and very loud.  Makes you very glad you were not there.",1405123200,,662,4.615384615384615

That doesn't make it 'worse' as some of the low-ranked and misguided reviews indicate. It's very true to Liekie and Sledge's books, which are among the very best American memoirs to come out of the war, written long before Private Ryan and BoB made such memoirs much more common. In kind, it's very true to the type of war they experienced. If you haven't seen this series, accept that it will be very different than BoB, and these differences are to be appreciated, along with those who served in the Pacific.",1405036800,,634,4.7207207207207205

But, in fairness, I have thus far watched only the first episode and that following closely on having watched the entirety of  Band of Brothers.  Further, I was once a member of the 101st Airborne Division, which may have colored my views.  I intend to see the remainder of The Pacific with an open mind before making a final determination.  The initial feeling from the first episode is that it does not fully engage one's attention as well as the first episode of the Band of Brothers. After viewing the full series, I may choose to update this preliminary review.

From conversations years ago with good friends, now deceased, who were in the 1st Marine Div in the Pacific combat, I think that in some ways, their fight was even tougher than the war in Europe.",1405036800,,841,4.5364238410596025

Haven't seen too many crusading limo liberals wringing hands over the horrors of combat in here. Just young boys becoming men, trying to survive and get home.  I seriously doubt anyone ( American citizen) who watches will criticize Harry Truman's military decisions.
While pieces of history weave through the story, the story is about the young men who risked everything in combat for the rest of us. The actors, none of whom actually experienced jungle warfare, portrayed the range of human endeavors under the most stressful of times.

After his entire platoon was either killed or wounded, he single handed held back wave after wave of Japanese troops, moving from machine gun to machine gun until reinforcements arrived and led a bayonet charge to drive the Japanese back. All this while wounded 14 times himself. He was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. Most who read this unknowingly know his face. The Hasbro Toy company requested permission to use Paige's face on it's GI Joe action figure.  Paige's only condition was he remain a Marine.

It really does a great job of portraying the comparative thanklessness that the Marines in the Pacific received compared to their counterparts in the armed services serving in Europe.  By the time most of the Marines came home the celebration was over and enthusiasm for returning servicemen had waned.  The brutality of the war in the Pacific was unmatched and the nightmarish scenes in this program really make you wonder how Marine veterans were able to survive with their sanity intact.

1158909,5,6305837325,"After watching The Pacific series, I must admit that I went into the viewing a little biased.  The Pacific has an older sibling called Band of Brothers and I was expecting both to be of equal quality.  And even though I believe The Pacific pales a bit in comparison to Band of Brothers, it is still a 4.6-5 star viewing experience...just a tad lesser than Band of Brothers.  If you can't already tell, I give Band of Brothers an enthusiastic 5 stars...but I give The Pacific maybe a 4.6-4.8 rounded to 5 stars (if that makes sense).

Overall, I would suggest this series to anyone who enjoys WWII movies or stories.  The cinematography is very similar to Band of Brothers but the characters and the storyline are not as interesting in my opinion.  The fact that it comes with Amazon Prime makes it all the better.

1159619,5,6305837325,"If you enjoyed Band of Brothers, you will definitely want to see The Pacific. Bloody, gripping, and far more damning of the condition known as War. Here the consequences, tragedies and violence of War is plainly evident as the men of the 1st Division slog it out in The Pacific. Grinding their way through well known places like Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima and Okinawa; the Marines also encountered heavy resistance in lesser known places like to Peleliu, Pavuvu and Cape Gloucester.

Unlike BoB, this series follows some specific men from the 1st Division, the focus shifts slightly away from the camaraderie of arms and more towards the tragedy of war. In ten episodes, Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks craft a vision of war as the Hell it truly is. No glamorous celebrations as they 'liberate' the local Europeans we're all so familiar with, here is the unappreciated defeat and destruction wrought by brutal de-humanizing combat, soaked in the muck of a bloody fox-hole.

The historical accuracy and attention to detail stand out in this artistic reproduction of the war in the Pacific. While the focus shifts away from the group, there is still plenty of character in the core characters and the men they fight with. A difficult chore of balancing continuous combat action with gripping personal consequences is deftly handled by the considerable script work. Towards the end of the series the viewer begins to understand just what PTSD is. When the boys come home, the relief is palpable and un-nerving, like a long and slow sigh of relief, joy and agony.

The music, pacing, and production from top to bottom were superb. All associated with this series should be commended for their work in making this serious, sobering look at the 'glory' of combat in the Pacific.",1404432000,,1766,4.919463087248322

1159772,5,6305837325,"When World War Two ended and the men returned home, many of them could not speak about what they did or saw. ""The Pacific"" graphically reveals the reason for their silence. It is brutal as well as revealing. Non stop combat took its toll both physically and mentally on the men immersed in a world they couldn't escape. Death was only one mistake away, and the men depended on one another to avoid that lethal error. If you watch the daily heroism great granddad experienced, you'll come to know more about him than ever before, since he would never tell you about this experience.  It is no happenstance that the Greatest Generation created what the United States came to be following the war, since they walked out of hell with an aspiration to make a better world than the one they left behind them. This explains why the United States became a nation builder.

Our true heroes were handed a Medal Of Honor on one day, and sent out to sell bonds the next day. John Basilone was one of these men, and his story is woven through out the series. America was broke and needed every dollar it could get for the war effort. Like he did on Guadacanal, Basilone stepped up and did what his nation asked of him.  In Marine Corps lore, he is an icon. A great young actor, Jon Seda, was cast to portray him, and he delivered an extraordinary performance. If you really want to know what drove men to do the unthinkable for the man standing next to him, watch this series. It is worth whatever they're asking to see it.",1404259200,,1510,4.424460431654676

The series demonstrates the enormous conflict as it plays out in the lives of individuals and real people. It's emphasis is that wars are always fought, in the end, by  individuals, with all their complexity. People,  not sitting in the war rooms but the uncrowned heads that have to deal with the ambiguities and the horror of it first hand.
This is an excellent series for the majority of the population who were not alive when this was all going on, when there was patriotic fervor aplenty and the draft was universal.

There is a clear reversal of humanity and compassion, to the most basic struggle for survival. Of interest to me while watching this, was the demonstration of unpredictable pairings among the soldiers, bonds that never would have happened in any situation but war.

The Pacific is well worth watching if you can tolerate the overwhelming depression and death that occurs. It calls to mind a movie I saw years ago called Hamburger Hill.

1160365,5,6305837325,"After the success of Band of Brothers, Executive Producer Tom Hanks and HBO collaborated to produce this series about the Pacific theater of action during WWII. Based in part on two separate books by two of the Marines featured in the series, it is a much different theme than Band of Brothers. Instead of following a single Company as in BoB, Pacific is centered more on the personal journeys of several Marines from their individual entrances into the service to the end of their service either by fatality or mustering out. Like BoB, it is superbly filmed with very realistic and poignant combat scenes. It is historically accurate and the Marines' stories are compelling. However, unlike BoB which concluded with a sense of profound accomplishment by Easy Company and ""relieved victory"" on the part of the Soldiers, Pacific leaves you with the impression that the majority of the Marines  featured simply wished the whole war had not happened and that they had not had any part in it. That does not imply that the participants were any less patriotic or devoted to duty than the soldiers of Easy Company, but instead is indicative of the very different combat conditions and enigmatic enemy the Marines faced in the Pacific versus the Soldiers in the European theater. An excellent historical drama that is well worth the time spent watching.",1404000000,,1346,4.929515418502203

The smell, the rain, mud, heat, humidity, bugs all made life miserable. To label it ""Hell on Earth"" is an understatement. ""The Pacific"" tells pretty much the same story as I heard in the 90's.

I wouldn't watch this with a young child, maybe only adults because there are some very graphic scenes that may give your children nightmares.  This series shows a young man who wants to get into the war as a Marine and then tracks him though the end of the war.  The transformation is scary, but probably a little more realistic than many John Wayne movies.

I had an uncle who was on Guadacanal and he never would talk about his experiences there.  Now that I have seen this series I can only imagine why he didn't want to talk about it.  Those guys are braver and than brave and all that generation which includes my father, my two fathers-in-law and many uncles who went through both the Pacific front and Europe battles.  This series truly shows the qualities that the ""greatest generation"" had and qualities we should all aspire to and instill in our children.  My son is a Marine who served two tours in Iraq and came back alive.  He is in this category of men who don't talk about their experiences but watching this series has made me more humbled and more proud of his service and that of my fathers and uncles.

1160564,4,6305837325,"Really depressing but also very good, because it captures the gravity with which the War in the Pacific was carried out. Maybe it was unavoidable, but couldn't have been much more terrible.

1160694,5,6305837325,"My grandfather was a Marine in WWII in the South Pacific, and I never really understood what he experienced or what it might have been like, because -- like so many others of his comrades -- they didn't talk about it.  They didn't consider themselves heroes.  They just did their jobs.  And when the war was over, they came home and took care of their families and livelihoods.  I can see now that many (most) of them didn't talk about it because of the horror of war.  The war in the South Pacific was more brutal and intense than we can ever imagine.  This series, ""The Pacific,"" gives us a glimpse of what it must have been like.  As I am watching this (I'm on Part 7), I think to myself, this isn't just a show.  Rather, this is a tribute to the gallant and brave efforts of men who gave of themselves, fought for their brothers, and preserved our freedom and way of life.

1160745,4,6305837325,"Disclaimer:  I have only viewed the first 2 episodes of this series. I am a cold war Marine from the late 50s. I am watching the series on my Kindle using Amazon Prime.

This series is as well done as any WWII action movie.  The Marine utilities look very authentic for that period.  And yes, even the bolt-action M1903 Springfield rifles shown in the series opener is an accurate portrayal for the start of the Guadalcanal campaign.

Why only 4 stars?  If there was a category of 5 stars with an asterisk I would give it that.  The asterisk is for a lacking a big warning about rough language, for inaccurately showing the very limited supply of drinking water available to front line marines, and for a lack of portraying how utterly desperate the situation was for marines the first 90 days of the 6 month campaign.  Little food, limited ammo, dysentery, and jungle rot plus malaria reduced the early fighting survivors to thin emaciated young men. I know that this is hard to show in a movie with strong virile actors, but nevertheless some attempt should have been made to convey the really terrible conditions.

Yes Ive read the books that the series is based upon.  It makes it a tiny bit easier to follow the movie and characters.  I look forward to viewing the remaining episodes.",1403740800,,1289,4.609649122807017

Not comparing to either of these epic films, but it's the feeling that is built by the unfolding of each episode that relates to current times and all that is war. It's an ode to those who were greater, braver and had to experience what most of us will not. That's what you really want from a movie / miniseries, and it does exactly that.

By then I basically didn't care about the series and just wanted it to be over. This is not an indictment of the men,the war, or the acting. The realism was excellent and I felt the stories of the hardships these men went through. The storytelling was pretty blog and everything from the music to the dialogue to the storylines were so utterly SERIOUS! Like when the men were on the ship arriving in Australia and the crowd was cheering, pretty girls blowing kisses at them, and the men onboard were portrayed as being dismissal of the whole show. 'What is this all about?' Or something to that effect. I'm sure no one was happy to see civilization again. And the music just ladled it on thick. Very realistic and well acted, just not much depth or story development.to me anyway.",1403740800,,893,4.5875

1160857,5,6305837325,This production successfully presented a view and insight into the human beings caught up in the eye of the conflict. The decisions that they made and why; all ground into the horror of what they faced AND what they had to do. Hopefully it will help us remember that PEOPLE fight wars. We need to be very aware of this when we as a nation and as a people face the heavy decision of where and when to engage  the ultimate tool of our politics.,1403740800,,442,4.2

HBO tends to be over the top with gore and the sex scenes were totally unnecessary. Band of brothers is the gold standard of these kind of shows and if you are looking for a series that will draw you in and have you invested in the people you will be disappointed.

I have always been an avid fan, and part-time student, of World War II, especially our Pacific Campaign. As I expected, ""The Pacific"" was fabulous! The battle scenes were very intense and the actors did a great job reflecting the terror of each fire fight and assault. There are some scenes that are so intense and well done that I actually had a tear in my eye.

The show even inspired me to read more about the war.  But I agree with another reviewer that I would probably not watch again as some of it was just too gruesome and painful (I even had to skip ahead at places).  This isn't really a criticism, they have thoroughly convinced me of the horrors of war both on and off the battlefield.  On the other hand, pacing was a bit off; what was supposed to be several months felt like only a few days.

I highly recommend but caution the faint at heart.,1403481600,,344,4.390625
1161196,5,6305837325,Too often we have overlooked the struggle and sacrifice suffered by our troops throughout the Pacific.  Very few of the Islands named could in the episodes would be recognized.  It was touching to see the war through real people and be reminded WWII really was World Wide and Americans found on all fronts.  I marveled at the discipline and courage these men displayed in facing such a violent and determined foe.  These are great men who served with Honor and Distinction.  Someone needs to send a copy of this to Susan Rice so she will understand what  those words mean.  This is great theatre and great history.,1403481600,,614,4.682242990654205

The hell that the soldiers and native civilians endured during the Japanese occupation has been depicted in very authentic style.

The war scenes are the most realistic I have seen, having experienced such in Vietnam myself. The essence of war, the killing, doesn't really change that much.  Just the setting and the technology used to accomplish ends.  The downside to this series is that if you are a vet, it's probably best to watch it alone or with your spouse.  If you're a recent combat vet, don't watch it at all.  Maybe in 20 years.  You have enough memories to keep you company.  You don't need this to bring it all back so soon.  If you have young kids, they don't need to see this.  Sixteen or seventeen...maybe.  But be ready to answer a lot of questions that are hard to answer beyond platitudes.

I watched the credits and saw Tom and Steve and thought this out to be good, but could not have anticipated how good.  What became very clear as I watched was this was not fictional, but based on the stories of actual combat veterans.  I didn't have to see the last episode to know that.  It was a delight to see the actual faces of the main characters, and what they went on to do and where they were now.  This is the kind of film that should become a new genre of film making.  It's like a documentary, but not.  It's like a work of fiction based on real events, but not exactly fiction, at least I hope certain things were not made up, like the stones in the head.  I bet that really happened.  Why else would they put something so disturbing in a film like this.  If that was made up, they should have left it out, which is why I believe it rely happened.  Therefore, it is stories like that, that need to be told; and images like that, that need to be filmed so we can know the true horrors those men faced.  It's hard to know what it was really like, and I think Tom and Steve and the entire crew have done a fine job showing it.

Unlike Band of Brothers, this series lacks the post-episode interviews with the actual men who served, although the last episode gives brief bio info on the main characters with their actual photos.

Overall, an amazing production that left me again in wonder at how these men and women who witness the horrors of war are able to rejoin civilian ranks, forced to submerge what were pretty dreadful memories (unless they're able to write their memoirs like Bob Leckie did). It's definitely one of those series that makes you want to go do some of your own research and further reading, which is a good thing in my case, at least. Speaking of which, Bob Leckie did NOT have an affair with a Greek Orthodox Australian girl in real life. The writers could have given a nod to Leckie's Greek Odyssey elements by just making Stella's fictional character something other than a Greek Orthodox Christian, as that's typically not the type of girl who would have voluntarily taken off her robe and stayed in bed with him the first night he came to dinner.",1403395200,,1272,4.7040358744394615

The battle scenes are graphic.  The climate endured by the Marines is accurately portrayed.  The terrain over which the battles were fought is mostly correct.

My Father was in the US military and I had the great fortune to spend a significant part of my youth in the Far East during the mid 60's to early 70's. My parents understood the importance of the Pacific campaigns in WW2. They took us to several major battle sites to visit.  This was well before most of these sites were cleared for tourists.  You could easily see the foxholes dug by the combatants as well as barbed wire and plenty of the debris of war.  We explored certain safe caves and Japanese fortifications.

However,  I hated The Pacific as much as I loved Band of Brothers.  Watching The Pacific felt a bit like watching war propaganda produced by the ""other side"".  I agree with a previous reviewer who wrote, ""...Band shows the Americans as heroes and liberators, Pacific portrays the U.S. Marines as victims and dupes"".  Some reviewers have complained about the sex scenes in The Pacific.  I agree, the sex scenes were unnecessary in a mini-series about war, but they were the most entertaining scenes; therefore, I reluctantly give The Pacific one star.",1403222400,4,728,4.975206611570248

When you watch this film, you can't help but feel that you are there.... yet can be so grateful that you were not there.  It is brutal war material.

My Dad spent some time in the South Pacific during the war and while he had it better than most since he was stationed on a PT boat base, he still lost a lot of weight and suffered from the conditions there.

1161770,5,6305837325,"My father was not a Marine but he was a WW II infantryman assigned to the 33rd Infantry Division under Gen Walter R Kruger's Sixth Army in the Pacific.  He fought in New Guinea (Lae, Finchoffen, and Holandria), and then participated in the invasions of Leyte and Luzon in the Philippines.  The Pacific brought home all the fear of night patrol actions, meeting encounters in dank almost impenetrable jungle and sudden violent death.  Dad never forgot the soldier's fear of being wounded and falling only a few feet off the trail and then being eaten by wild pigs.  The last episode shows a returning Marine applying for college and listing his job skills in anger to his interviewer ""killing Japs.""  A horrible war fed by racism on both sides, made worse by an outdated medieval code that would not accept surrender as an honorable act.  The men in my father's unit in their first few actions respected the fighting spirit of the Japanese Soldier but after a few actions came to a place of disgust over how cheap life seemed to the average Japanese Soldier.  From there things went down hill fast with few US Soldiers willing to risk their lives to aid even a wounded enemy.",1403136000,,1174,4.642512077294686

My only minor problem: USMC liberty uniforms were not accurate - WWII liberty uniform were not the ""Eisenhower"" type jacket but rather the full jacket.  Placement of insignias on both Marines' and sailors' uniforms were not accurate.  1st MARCORPS shoulder insignia should have been placed on the left side vs the right side; chevrons for petty officer dungarees should only have been on one sleeve.  I viewed the series on a Kindle Fire HDX.  Every episode between the middle and 3/4 of the way through he video would stop and return to the beginning of the episode - usually at a critical point of the episode.  I contacted AMAZON but the suggested solution for the issue didn't work.  I'm about ready to return the HDX and revert back to my Kindle Fire.",1403136000,,785,4.727941176470588

Historical accuracy? Don't know.. I'm sure the writers mixed history and Hollywood together.  If you're looking for facts only then best to watch a WW2 documentary off PBS or History Channel.

Good writing coupled with fine acting. This is a mini-series worth watching.

But then I remember the HBO formula... Marines were mostly a motivated volunteer force (especially early in WWII), but these guys look like draftees or part of a prison chain gang. Leckie is the character that Hanks or Spielberg would see themselves as, the thoughtful writer, attracts beautiful women, is heroic, but jaded by the horror of war, blah blah, modern Hollywood hero stereotype. Of course the USMC officers fit the stereotype as useless dolts. (except for Chesty Puller who is only in there for historical reference). I wonder why they completely overlooked the heroism of the Marine Air Wing and the ""cactus airforce"" at Guadalcanal? Anyway, I've already wasted more time writing about this than it deserves. Two stars for at least following a historical  story line. Google some USMC history if you want to see pictures of real Marines. ""Marines at Tarawa"" is a good documentary film.

1162044,5,6305837325,"Despite the Allied troops' hard-won triumph over the armies of Mussolini and Hitler, the Japanese battled on in the islands of the Pacific. The 10-part series, ""The Pacific,"" portrays that conflict, which was waged in unbelievably difficult terrain, torrential downpours, punishing heat, and food and water shortages, all while battling an insidious enemy maniacally committed to literally fighting to the last soldier. The Japanese soldier code regarded surrender as dishonor,so it was either victory or death for them. Like Band of Brothers, the series centers on a small group--this time, the hell-for-leather Marines--but it intersperses the horrendously graphic battle scenes with personal sidebar stories, as various soldiers take short leaves or are hospitalized. This allows the characters to be more fully developed as their backstories are revealed. The Pacific is not just Band of Brothers in a different location, though equally good. It has a different feel to it also. Amid the fighting, which frequently came down to literal hand-to-hand combat, the issues of conscience, loyalty, and the psychological toll of war are more deeply explored. Yet there are moments of dark humor too. I highly recommend this series, but it is definitely adult fare.",1403049600,,1261,5.471794871794872

There was no specific band of Marines that really fought in all the campaigns since the causality rates were so high in the combat units.  So this story follows a few Marines through selected points in time in WWII based on accounts and memoirs.  It hits all of the points in the journey and honours the men who both died and survived the intense battles.

We watched the entire season, episodes 1-10, on successive nights so as not to lose the thread of the lives of the solders. We were in awe of some of the reenactments. The photography was superb.

The series bounces around alot between an individual character or character(s), and was hard for me to follow at times. I think it captures the physical, mental, and emotional effects of war well and does well with character development. However, it was very slow at times. It is incredibly sex-saturated, which is no major surprise for HBO, but it just seems to be unnecessary and unrelated to much of anything. There is no doubt that the religious faith of many would be tested and some would abandon their faith, you can certainly understand why when you catch a small glimpse of what many experienced in the war. But of course the atheist is portrayed as the enlightened person who is showing the happy-go-lucky Christian the way out of Plato's cave. This seems to be an all too popular portrayal, which I don't think is warranted here. Perhaps I did not like it simply because the European campaign seems to get all the hype, and I found that more interesting because of the setting. I also preffered the cast on Band of Brothers. It was certainly eye-opening to say the least, though I don't know if I would recommend it to anyone.",1403049600,8,1224,4.6192660550458715

1162415,3,6305837325,"I put off watching this series for a long time. My judgment is somewhat mixed as I feel the series was uneven. A few of the episodes are superb in showing the confusion and terror of combat, especially the night-time attacks.  They drew me in and I felt I was there.  For the most part, the acting is fine.  I didn't care for the romantic relationships. Other than Basilone's courtship and marriage, none of them were essential to the story and that story time could have been used on the troops.  With just 10 episodes, I suppose it made sense to focus on the Marines, but they weren't in the Pacific by themselves.  They barely mentioned the Navy and Army.  A series focusing on the Pacific theater is long overdue, but they completely ignored the POWs and the civilian concentration camps.",1402963200,,792,4.581560283687943

1162422,4,6305837325,"When I first heard that Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg were going to bring out another mini series along the lines of ""Band of Brothers"" I was super excited. When I heard that they were going to make it about the Marine Corps in World War II I was elated! The Pacific Theater of Operations is the bastard son of the U.S. military involvement of World War II, and I'm glad it's starting to receive the just treatment it deserves. My grandfather served in the U.S. Navy from 1944-46 and took part in the invasion of the Philippines and other engagements; he would often tell me that he enlisted in the Navy to avoid having his guts splattered all over the Pacific like the Marines so often did. He always kept his inner-service rivalry with the Corps, but he shielded a deep and ultimate respect for the men who fought and bled on those forgotten islands of the Pacific Theater; and would be elated that his sacrifice, as well as millions more Americans are now being brought to the forefront.

 ""The Pacific"" does an absolutely terrific job of bringing the horrors of hitting the beaches of the Pacific, as well as the sheer terror of surviving a cunning enemy entrenched in the jungle willing to fight to the absolute death. The Japanese soldier was often portrayed in Hollywood as nothing more than a bucktooth, inferior subhuman being that could never stand up to the military know-how of the Euro/American militaries of the day. However, I'm sure that anybody that fought the Japanese army during World War II would ultimately disagree. At one time during the show, the actor playing John Basilone harshly corrects a new Marine that only wants to ""Slap a Jap"" by informing him of the dedication and ferocity with which the Japanese soldier fought and died on Guadalcanal. The mini-series does a magnificent job of bringing the bitterness and harshness of the Pacific to light; the combat scenes explain in detail just how tough a man had to be to deal with the constant state of fear and anxiety that accompanies war.

While many have complained that the character development of the series lacks at best, or at least that it's not ""Band of Brothers,"" I enjoyed just about every character and their roles. My biggest complaint with the mini-series is the portrayal of Eugene Sledge. I'm not sure why, but Joseph Mazzello never grabbed me and made me want to like his character. I felt that his part was contrived and often overblown, and by the end of the show you feel as though he was nothing short of a raving lunatic. Now I know combat fatigue would have caused men to do horrific things, but the way Mazzello played his part just never drew me in. Other than that minor gripe I felt the show was addicting and a worthy addition to any fan of World War II movies or history. To be totally honest, I'd have kept watching if they would have kept making. Yep, they were that good.",1402963200,,2884,4.596116504854369

Viet Vets suffered trauma in the Nam and later Stateside from people who should have honored them.  Unlike WWII Marines Veterans of Nam were not given parades, or honored at home; even by Vets organizations like the Amerikan Legion or VFW Posts for many many years.  The humiliations heaped on Viet Vets caused many to despair and some to die by their own hands.  I think when history is written those men who volunteered and were drafted will be seen as much a Marine as any who served in the Pacific.  Even as recently as those demonstrating at Quantico Marine Corps Base to have a fellow Marine released from the Brig for opposing the debacle in Iraq, Bradley Manning, who were themselves highly decorated Vets of Viet Nam and some Officers as well were treated so bad that I am ashamed of my Government who keeps engaging in worthless and ill fated WARS strictly to advance their own careers all done for Profit by Major WAR INDUSTRIES.

In contrast to Band of Brothers, which describes the EU campaign against Hitler and the Axis powers, Pacific delves more deeply into fewer characters, such as Eugene Sledge and John Basilone, Medal of Honor winner.  This series shows the human spirit, and many times, how it hung by a thread as the US forces battled their way west, island by island, to force Japan to surrender.  It is dramatically impactful, funny and illustrates human nature at its best and worst.

I have read his book ""With the old breed"" and it is an excellent book. I am amazed at the terror and hardships that our soldiers have had to go thru and still do. Anybody who has any interest in WW 2, watch this. If you know of anybody who served during this time, NOW is the time to talk to them and ask them about the war, if they want too.

1162959,5,6305837325,"It is really impossible to rate a series like The Pacific objectively.  You either get it or you never will.  If you get it, it is moving and it is a reminder that those who came before us paid a terrible price for what we now have.  Thats the debt we pay on when we ruck up and head outside the wire for todays reindeer games.  If you are one of we few, we happy few, then like the series or not, you will get it.  The good news is that the The Pacific is so masterfully told that prior experience is not required.
 If you don't get it, well, until you understand that war isn't a CNN sound bite, it isn't a happy ending and war has never been what Hollywood, for the most part, throws up on the screen.  Its the awful truth that its better to be lucky than good, where the f-word is simply a coma and where there is no such thing as to much ammo and a full canteen is slightly better the sex.
Some of reviews crab about the slow parts, sorry, there are lots of slow parts in the real thing.  Some thought that the romantic notes were out of place, bad news again, those are what keep you sane or mostly sane: that warm fuzzy thought that somewhere there is someone who you don't need to kill before they can kill you and even more important: someone to whom killing is an alien thought and yet they still like and maybe love you.
Some said the series is jerky and hard to keep up, but then so is real life and war is real life on steroids.
I gave it 5 stars because it was as real as Hollywood is going to get, not a slam but a hat tip to the writers and Steven Spielberg, and Tom Hanks.",1402617600,,1589,3.9748427672955975

This series on its own is a vivid and graphic representation of WWII in the Pacific, but because it follows three guys in different areas and with different story lines, it is less cohesive than following Easy company in Europe was.  On its own it is worthy of respect, but those expecting to develop the same level of interest as Band of Brothers will potentially be disappointed.  It's not fair to the series to be judged against another, but the comparison is inevitable.",1402617600,,618,4.6422018348623855

I think what I originally didn't like was how it popped in and out of the combat zone-- guys going on leave and hitting on women, the whole 'Flags Of Our Fathers' style war bond drive detour, etc.-- whereas in Band of Brothers, the focus of the story was 100% on what they went through together, which reinforced their isolation from the rest of the world and really made you care about all of them equally. This series, though, was really only about three guys (Lackey, Sledge, and Basilone), and most of the other characters around them seemed flat by comparison, since they were all just supporting the arc of the principal character's story.",1402617600,,766,4.557971014492754

1163096,5,6305837325,"I watched Band of Brothers and The Pacific around Memorial Day this year (2014). I had watched BoB before but not this series. I was struck by how much more brutal the Pacific island war was, mostly due to the Japanese unwillingness to surrender, which forced the Marines to kill large numbers of them. I had read Eugene Sledge's fine book, ""With the Old Breed on Peleliu,"" but not Bob Leckie's ""Helmet for My Pillow,"" which I've now purchased (on Amazon of course). It is a commonplace today to refer to all those in the military as heroes. I believe this is a bad habit. It denigrates the behavior of the real heroes. Everyone in the service has taken brave steps, and has put themselves (potentially at least) in harm's way. Some of the service people lose their lives as a result. But anyone who kills other people loses something else -- part of their humanity -- part of their soul if you will -- and it is this sacrifice that I was most taken with. It's unimportant that many in the military don't know it's going to happen, and some even don't realize that it has happened. It's still there, and the Marines in the Pacific theater, I believe, would all have said that they did what they had to do, despite suffering consequences afterwards. They gave up part of their humanity -- to keep themselves alive, to protect their service mates -- and ultimately for the people at home. That's the sacrifice we should honor them for. Despite having read many books about WWII -- and other wars -- there was something about The Pacific that highlighted this for me. As I think about it, the fact that the boys were so young, that the acting was so good, and that this aspect of their struggle was shown without smacking the watcher with it -- you should watch this series too and see what you think.",1402617600,,1798,4.484756097560975

This sense is intensified if viewed with the audio played via surround sound.  The series covers all major military objectives in the Pacific Theater.

It starts with the events leading up to the invasion of the island of Guadalcanal. A lot of people don't realize how close we came to losing that battle.

I have talked to Uncles, in-laws and neighbors who were in the Pacific.  This program was a mockery of the men who fought and the how they felt.  Even the uniforms were a mockery of how our men looked and how they respected themselves.  I have lost a lot of respect for the Producers of this.  I would expect far, far more from Tom Hanks and Stephen Spielberg who have claimed to honor our veterans and our nation.  There was no honor here.  Only hopelessness and  political agenda.",1402444800,3,644,4.435897435897436

1163466,1,6305837325,"Too much of a good thing makes for a putrid experience. In plain words, the over-use of sentimentalism made this series wreak with too much floral sweetness. Yes it's like being around someone who doesn't realize they are using too much perfume and it's making some people feel nauseous. Besides the grossly romantic sentimentalism, the series seems one dimensional -in other words, boring and predictable. Putting these factors together, the viewing effect is a  feeling like the message of the series is glorifying war.

1163538,5,6305837325,"I watched this series at the urging of my father, who is a big WWII buff, and was immediately drawn in by the visuals and musical score.  Knowing the production team (Tom Hanks's Playtone and HBO), it was obvious that the team sought to recapture the gritty reality these soldiers faced.  I don't think that this could have been duplicated on network television.  Indeed, the reality of the Pacific theater was not appropriate for children, even the 14-15 year old Marines who enlisted underage and fought there.

One of the most interesting parts of the series was that it is based on memoirs from soldiers who fought there and recounted their experiences.  I am listening to the audiobook for ""With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa"" by Eugene ""Sledgehammer"" Sledge.  A new version of the audiobook was released in 2013 using the actors who portrayed Sledge and Robert Leckie (author of ""Helmet for My Pillow: From Parris Island to the Pacific"") as the narrators of their respective books.  In a way, it brings the characters full circle to have the actors narrate their characters memoirs, and lets you know that they viewed their characters with a sense of respect and understood the importance of their work in bringing ""The Pacific"" to life.

I highly recommend watching this series, as I will probably be watching it again soon to catch some of the smaller details I missed the first time.",1402358400,,1400,4.804166666666666

This movie is gritty and gut wrenching and I had to binge on the whole 10 episodes.  I found it very emotional and it touched on so many aspects of humans at war and the carnage it causes both on the battlefield and in the aftermath of so many lives.

Most Americans think of Normandy or the Battle of the Bulge when they think of WWII our thoughts rarely turn to the awful, relentless slough that was the brutal,island hopping, malarial experience of the Pacific theater. There is no romance associated with the Pacific, no French people greeting our armies as liberators, no mayors presenting our commanding officers with the keys to the city.
The portrayal of the life altering experience of the Pacific War is violently and grindingly portrayed here. It was difficult to watch at many times but I am grateful for the quality employed in capturing the unrelenting violence and adversity our men and women had to deal with. And I am profoundly grateful for our service men and women who enduring this experience and gave their lives to secure some forms of freedom in that part of the world and to defeat the racist Japanese military of that time.",1402099200,,1024,4.823863636363637

But that's hardly a knock on the Pacific.  It has a somewhat different feel to it than BoB.  Both use similar styles, but BoB's characters were more easily related to, imho.  Seems as if the focus in the Pacific was more on the ""hand wringing"" and personal demond=s the soldiers endured as a result of their experience.  BoB certainly had a lot on the personal demons the soldiers faced during their service--which was well done and superbly performed by a superior cast in BoB.  At times, it seemed as if the Pacific ignored the big picture--something BoB did a great job of to help educate and provide context.  The Pacific was all about the individuals.  Which is fine.  But one thing about BoB was the story was engrossing and it was educational.  The timeline in the Pacific felt choppy at times and didn't always provide context within the big picture of the war--which is simply a preference that would have been nice for my own personal education.  The battle scenes are fantastic and give you feel for what the soldier's endured.  But sometimes is was so chaotic that it was difficult to follow the character in the battle.  I think the chaotic nature of the battles could have still been displayed without confusing the audience.  But all of that is nitpicking.

My brother joined the Marine Corps on Dec. 8, 1941 and landed at Guadalcanal the following August. He served courageously in the 1st Marine Division as it island-hopped across the South Pacific the next three years, as portrayed in this awesome docudrama. As fate would have it, later in the Korean War I served in the same highly-decorated Marine division. My brother contracted malaria on Guadalcanal and was never able to get rid of the disease. Eventually, it would take his life at age 62. I tearfully watched The Pacific and relived my beloved brother's World War II experiences.

The sad fact was that there never developed any kind of personal investment in the characters of this mini-series.

Years later I gave The Pacific another shot. I thought that maybe I missed something. No, I didn't miss anything. I still do not think it was that great. Between bad acting, bad casting, confusing timelines and visual let-downs, it was a trainwreck to me. What kept it going were some excellent scenes, a good score, and some interesting plot lines.

Hanks/Spielberg did a great job showing the war's timeline in the Pacific, but where they fell down was what seemed to be a new story thread of including too much on the home front, with the soldiers lives before and during the war.  I liked the format of Band of Brothers with commentary at the beginning of each episode form a surviving member of ex company, gave more context.  The, what seemed to me, rushed effort of adding context via romance between Leckie in Australia, and Sgt Basilone on Camp Pendleton was a waste of good story telling time imo.  It would have been better spent focusing on the theater of war, and maybe getting some more stories from Tarawa, Saipan, and more on Iwo.

That being said, there was a lot lacking in this series. I found the 1st half of the series in particular just jumped around too much, making it hard to care or follow any particular soldier's story. I feel like it did settle down though in the 2nd half and the series takes a pretty dark turn while following the fantastic story of E. Sledge. The psychological aspect that was explored was reminiscent of Vietnam and it caught me off guard. I found myself irritated when it was interrupted by Basilone's love story, but this is how they chose to tell this story.

Another mistake, IMO, was the lack of interviews with the men that were there and the very little information given about the various stages in the war. I appreciate that the focus was on these men more than the war, but those little pieces should have been included.

Overall, it is a great series that is definitely worth watching.

1164291,4,6305837325,"Can I be forgiven for writing the third time about a 10-part mini-series? It was the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbour that brought the Americans officially into a war that the rest of the world had been waging for over two years and they would not be ready to engage until nearly a year later but yet guess who thinks they won the war? Guess its obvious Im not an American. This is not to denigrate the sacrifices made by those who went into battle and never came home again or did so maimed in body and spirit.

This series is unique in making the war experience personal. The depiction of war is brutal and the enemy fanatical but it is the personal details that bring the horror of war home to us. Eugene Sledge would not be the first doctors son whose Father tried to keep him away from a war. Their ongoing relationship begins and ends the series. The startling normalcy of life back home is in stark contrast to the experience of the Marines on those small pieces of coral in the vast Pacific. There the jungle, the insects, the critters, and endemic diseases were every bit as much a danger as the enemy. Wars are won and lost on the stomachs of the men who fight them, an army marches on its stomach and cannot survive long without clean water.

The first landing contrasts arriving to find troops resting on the beach with the suspenseful march through an eerie and unknown jungle environment. Finding the abandoned enemy camp ups the ante then comes the rain.

Several themes seem to be common to all war movies. Inept West Point Educated Lieutenants whose book larnin ill equips them for the rigors of battle. Command decisions that squander hundreds and thousands of lives on meaningless objectives. Friendly fire incidents often involving aerial or ship to shore bombardment. Soldiers killed by their comrades because they did something stupid at night. The various manifestations of battle fatigue. The nightmares that last a lifetime after the war.

Had I been a veteran don't know as I could have sat through this series. Not sure that like is quite the appropriate word for it.

Fourth kick at the cat

What still strikes me most is the utter futility of War. The wasted human effort, the lives lost and ruined, the devastation, the environmental damage. The only true winners are those who own the factories that manufacture the engines of war. Survival is a matter of sheer randomness though some are better at keeping their heads down than others. That same randomness determines whether or not an award for valour is awarded posthumously. The first casualty was shot by his buddies when he snuck off to answer a call of nature and his wasn't the last such death. Life is never so precious as when one is threatened with losing it. The rush of battle and the euphoria that follows it becomes addictive and one aspect of PTSD is the feeling of futility that follows the loss of that high. Some handle battle conditions better than others and war isn't kind to philosophers, thinkers and the sensitive. Some have more luck than others including generals whose decisions can fate the death of thousands for a useless objective. Taking the initiative and advancing unannounced can get you hit by your own artillery.

As Basilone discovers fame is a fickle friend. Being rewarded for heroism often involves being lionized for acts of stupidity that one managed to survive and someone took the time to recognize. Survivors guilt and the knowledge that others were equally as brave but were not recognized rapidly sets in. There is a distinct irony in  being rewarded for the taking of life. The experience of battle too often leaves soldiers unable to feel fulfilled outside the field of battle and there seems to be a fine line between battle heroics and suicide by enemy.

The dropping of the first atomic bombs targeted civilians rather than military objectives but civilians and their livelihoods are always the collateral damage of war. However morally reprehensible the dropping of those bombs may have been there is no question that they saved the lives of untold thousands on both sides. War is state-sanctioned murder. It is frightening to think that some enjoy it. Does labelling someone the enemy any more justification for killing than execution for capital crime. Is deserting an insane field of battle an act of cowardice or a sane act of self-preservation.

The most poignant and compassionate moment in the entire series comes at the end when Sledges father expresses understanding for his sons unwillingness to take the life of another living creature. This is the same man who refused to give his under-age son his permission to enlist and stated the troubled feelings he had at witnessing the lack of life in the eyes of the men he treated in WW#1.",1401753600,,4787,4.76357056694813

The Pacific lacks some of the sweeping narrative that holds the story of the 101st Airborne in Band of Brothers together from boot camp through seizing the Eagle's Nest. Perhaps that is inherent in the type of war fought across island chains scattered throughout the namesake ocean. I also felt that the actors of The Pacific are less grounded than those portraying EZ Company. Gone also are the first person mini-interviews that began each episode of Band of Brothers - I wish I could have heard some  anecdotes directly from the Marines who lived through these stories.

For all my criticisms however, the scope of this story is as vast as the Pacific. We follow marines as they battle the enemy, the climate and their own internal demons. I could not help but feel that the portrayal of jungle warfare in this show is heavily reflective of the way in which later wars such as Vietnam were covered. Combat felt ""icky"", killing the enemy became an amusement in some cases, and the Marines' anti-Japanese bias is far sharper than that shown to Germans or Italians in the European war.

This is an important television show and is certainly far superior to the vast majority of what is available via free streaming. I highly recommend this show.",1401667200,,1623,4.720848056537102

The series is powerful, tells a magnificent story, and offers those even slightly aware of geography a little understanding of the vast differences between the war in Europe and the war in the Pacific.

As outsiders, we will never completely know the challenges that these individuals faced, but we can continue to make attempts to honor them and and their sacrifices which were make willingly and without hesitation.

Thank you HBO for creating  this profound WW2 film with such detailed excellence to the screen. Hopefully it will be utilized as an adjunct to our young generation for years to come.
Thank you HBO and the writers and producers for bring this to us! In the future, if the opportunity to create more historical movies of this caliber, it would be a tremendous benefit to our young country for the application of how grateful we are for our freedom.

1164501,5,6305837325,Band of Brothers is a classic for all time. While The Pacific was good the story felt rushed and there were probably too many disconnected stories going on. I will forever love these 2 titles forever but BOB will always be the #1 out of the two. Thankfully this is available for free so we don't need to get into a conversation of which one is worth buying over the other. Honestly I think it's the closest thing to the real experience us civilians will ever get and is probably nowhere close to how brutal the Pacific theater really was. I think the main concept of this series was to show just how worn out and exhausting it was to be a marine during this war. The concept of victory and pride is less pronounced in this series than Band of brothers. I love how well the actors portrayed the pure exhaustion and insanity experienced during the war and overall the battle scenes were about as good as you can ask for. There is really nothing bad to say about this series when you look at it by itself other then maybe it felt a little rushed. You can also maybe say some of the facts weren't entirely accurate but at the same time its not a documentary its a drama.,1401408000,,1166,4.280542986425339
1164551,5,6305837325,"Started watching the HBO series Pacific over the Memorial Day weekend. Gut-wrenching. Towards the end of the first episode Chesty Puller shows up. Goose-flesh. I think I met him once at my grandfather's house. We called my grandfather The Colonel, because he was a Marine who had been wounded in Belleau Wood in WWI and had been on that staff of the Marine command in the Pacific in WWII. He and Gen. Puller were good friends. i also had two uncles who were Marines in the fighting in the Pacific. What a mixture of horror and majesty. I couldn't stop the tears. Following the lives of two real persons Lieke and Sledge was to watch how war destroys and creates ordinary men and women at the same time. The fight was not only for the ""real estate"" and our freedom, but maybe more importantly the very humanity of those involved in the conflict. A most compelling and dramatic sense of the human drama before our eyes was Sledge's encounter with the little Japanese baby cring beside it's dead parents. Is it a trap, or what?  Our entire value system shifts when we would normally rescue it immediatley. The the piece de resistance follows when he is leaving the hut and spies a Japanese woman mortally woulnded. He approaches her and in a long dramatic silent drama she asks him to shoot her and put her out of her misery. She pulls the rifle to her head and weakly motions to him to pull the trigger. He cannot, and instead takes the dying woman in her arms and comforts her until her dying breath.

1164552,4,6305837325,"The best part of of this docu-drama  in my opinion was the attention paid to the emotional side of the war and the readjustments that occurred not only with the returning servicemen but also there families and the portrayal of the changes that changed the servicemen form boys to men and the impact the combat had on their lives.  Heavily slanted towards the USMC.  Especially the segment on Guadalcanal and the references to Henderson Field.  Henderson Field was constructed by SEA-BEES and they were there from the get go.  It kind of insinuated that this Marine detachment was first in.  Well, the Japanese didn't build that airstrip and call it Henderson Field.  I know this because my Dad was there on the canal, building Henderson Field on one end of the runway while the USMC was fighting the Japanese on the other.
That being said, it was a quality film.  I can't quite figure out why the romance between the Greek gal in Australia with Leckie crashed.  I don't think that was really made clear in that segment.",1401408000,,1019,4.679775280898877

The main problem is that they waited almost 10 years before releasing this show. ""Band of Brothers"" probably had more success as well due to the fact it helped people escape from thinking about the events of 9/11 and that it was similar to ""Saving Private Ryan."" However, this show is very good. Unlike it's predecessors, which focused on the Army Airborne unit, this focuses on the Marine Corp.

Band of Brothers followed one group through the entire war in a multitude of different battlefields. Characters were developed that  you cared about. In The Pacific, you don't really know the characters very well. The other big problem is every Marine battle in the Pacific was almost exactly the same. There was no diversity of missions. Just one island grind after another against a largely faceless but brutal enemy. That's the truth but it's not very interesting. So this has the feel of a production that was overly drawn out and one that lacks the cohesiveness of Band of Brothers.

I always enjoyed studying the Second World War in school but for some reason I've always been less familiar with the war in the pacific.  This really peaked my curiosity throughout the series.

I saw some of the other negative reviews about the story being disjointed and I agree.  The mini-series is based on two books from two different authors who only crossed paths once during the ten episodes.  This does cause some of the story to be disjointed, and I admit that I like Band of Brothers better because ultimately the story is more unified.  However, the show is really well made and absolutely worth the ten hours of viewing time.  Overall the awe of the entire experience outweighs some of the flaws in tying all the stories together.

I think all Americans should watch The Pacific as well as Band of Brothers.",1401148800,,911,4.679245283018868

1164938,5,6305837325,"There seems to be alot of people who compare this in poor light compared to Band of Brothers (BoB).  Don't get me wrong, I love Band of Brothers.  Both my grandfather fought in Europe.  That being said I think the Pacific really was an improvement on BoB.

First off, one issue with BoB is that there are so many characters and they come in and out. It's realistic in that sense, but the first time you watch it, it's easy to get confused on who is who.  I've seen BoB a dozen times so not an issue for me anymore, but Pacific's focus on fewer characters allows for less confusion as well as character development.

In the Pacific there are three main story lines with focus on three main people.  I've read two of their autobiographies which were the basis of the show and the show does a good job in being (mostly) accurate.  The focus on the three characters allows you to get more connected with them.  This also allowed for better acting imho as I felt the stretched cast in BOB resulted in some average acting from some characters.  Everyone in this show gives an amazing  performance and Rami Malick as Snafu really hits a home run.  I actually feel that this was a little more accurate and realistically darker then BoB.

People also say that this one is boring action wise compared to BoB.  I really don't understand that at all.  There were several episodes in BoB which had little action, which was actually accurate and didn't bug me.  In Pacific however they do a very good job of putting serious combat in most every episode.

Bottom line, I give Band of Brothers 5 out of 5 and I give this 5.5 out of 5.  Classic must watch for any fan of WWII films.",1399852800,2,1665,4.368078175895765

They are different branches of the military, BOB is Army and Pacific deals with Marines. I definitely recommend this to watch. I alread to my brother-in-law to watch this as well. It follows 3 marines, 2 of the marines have books out ( I have one by Robert Leckie ""Helmet for my Pillow"") and the other marine is a very important marine that all marines learn about in bootcamp.

This is one of the books used as the basis for creating The Pacific series and Eugene Sledge (Sledgehammer) is one of the main characters in the show. The book is phenomenal and one of the best real-person narratives of World War II available. Read it. I then decided to re-watch The Pacific, which I had seen originally on HBO when it first came out. Now that I knew more of the background and was more familiar with many of the characters, the series came alive like I had never seen it before. I binged totally and went back to watch the special features, the amazing historical backgrounds, the interviews and just about everything else on this fantastic Blu-ray set.

Their exhausting research has paid excellent dividends in this realistic series.  The way this work is filmed, you feel you are set back in time within the characters' lives.  Additionally, the CG is convincingly good with the naval armadas that are back grounding the various colorful South Seas scenes.

The reason being that they are now producing a 3rd HBO miniseries based off the book ""Masters of the Air"" and it will surely come out in a matching tin. This means that if you have the Band of Brothers tin you can have this one and the one from the new series as well so they all match. This is just something to consider if you are into collecting matching sets, otherwise most people might buy the version with The Pacific and Band of Brothers in one case.",1392163200,,624,4.1652892561983474

The show comes with bonus features including a field guide which shows additional interviews with historians and veterans on their opinion of the episode and what happened in the real war vs the show. If you've seen band of brothers this show has a lot more action and blood and is better overall in my opinion. Tom Hanks and Stephen Spielberg are producers.

1165373,5,6305837325,"I've read a number of reviews that compare this series with BOB and feel it was better. But it is an unfair comparison. I love BOB, however it was more about just what the title said. The Pacific was about what it's title was about, war in the pacific. The pacific war was much more up close and personal. The Japanese and Americans hated each other. It was brutal, mean, cruel, savage, and unrelenting. The Japanese would not surrender no matter how many men they lost, or how hopeless it was for them. America was not used to fighting this kind of war, but soon realized they had to if they were to win. The pacific pictures this graphically and overwhelmingly, with very good acting, special effects, and outstanding blu ray images. The musical scores by Hans Zimmerman are the best I've heard since saving private Ryan. This series puts you in the war. That's how real it is. You can't help but come away with awe at the incredible sacrifice our marines made in that theatre of war. I know they will all be in the kingdom heaven, for they served their time in hell. God bless them all.",1388534400,2,1089,4.45
1165414,5,6305837325,"I received this as a gift and thoroughly enjoyed it.
This series is graphic and provides an exceptional glimpse of the USMC in action in the Pacific.
It takes a number of unique perspectives from personal experiences and masterfully weaves them into an interconnecting story that captures the essence of the USMC actions in the Pacific.
There is no valid comparison between the War in Europe and the War in the Pacific. Those that have written reviews and made that comparison should be ignored. Sometimes I read these reviews and want to critique them.  For those that did not perceive the mastery of this series I really feel sorry for you.  For those that did not give it five stars I wonder whether you have any clue about the real world.

1165476,4,6305837325,"Following the fortunes of three real US marines in WWII, The Pacific is not Band of Brothers and never would be but the comparison, it seems, is irresistible to many. The theatre is different and so are the issues. The source material is different too, coming, as it does, from books written by two of the main characters.

The popularity of The Pacific's predecessor meant that the producers could go one of two ways; capitalise on the theme by running a new series with the same feel or go in an entirely new direction. They chose the latter and while it's not without its faults, it was an admirable decision and the final product is much better than it gets any credit for being.

This was always going to be a controversial decision but one I'm glad they made. Those who complain that it is ""not Band of Brothers"" probably missed the point.

The European theatre is easy to understand, with the bad guys led by a man with a bad haircut and an equally bad toothbrush moustache. The Pacific campaign was less so. The result is that it has always been easier to make movies about the European war than the Pacific because there was no one individual who could be an obvious symbol for the enemy.

If you need evidence, look at the relative successes of Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, one a classic war book, the other dreamed up by scriptwriters. One was well received, the other less so.

When you can easily pass off the military issues like that, it becomes easier to concentrate on the story. In short, Band of Brothers was more accessible than The Pacific and there is less to challenge the audience.

So what is the difference?

In my opinion, The Pacific runs a strong anti-war theme right through it. That's not to say that Band of Brothers is pro-war, just that evidence of anti-war themes is less prominently placed.

In other forums, this has been interpreted as being politically correct or even pro-Japanese. It is neither. While the series doesn't go into the sickening realms of atrocities, I don't think it is fair to criticize it for not doing so. There are just too many issues to fit into 10 episodes.

With a particular emphasis on the terrible personal toll the war extracted, The Pacific succeeds admirably and I suggest that those who criticize it for being shallow or lacking in character development might want to look again.

Watch as the happy-go-lucky Bob Leckie starts to suffer the effects of long-term exposure to fear and anxiety. Contrast the devout, idealistic Eugene Sledge with the battle-hardened marine of Okinawa. He even looks older.

Physical injuries are one thing; emotional injuries are quite another. PTSD, explained away by doctors as tiredness, was not well understood then and people, it was assumed, would just be able to get along normally once they got home.

Clearly, for a man like Eugene Sledge, this was not the case as he struggled to overcome his demons. Unfortunately, I think many people missed this primary message because it was not what they were expecting. Audiences, as a rule, don't like to be challenged too much and this might have been asking more of some people that they were willing or able to give.

I challenge anyone to get through the last two episodes, one on the island of Okinawa, the other at home, without feeling that the price of war was too high for many and that war was not what they expected.

The basic stories of the three men are tweaked from the books two of them wrote. While some have criticized The Pacific for not exploring the overarching campaign further, I think this would have been a mistake. No individual soldier can be expected to understand the global issues of a campaign like that of the Pacific and combat memoirs usually provide a vignette rather than a strategic analysis.

They can only be judged on what they represent and it would be well nigh impossible to cover the campaign in such detail.

The acting performances are of a pretty high standard. I found the main characters sympathetically portrayed and very believable although I think the character of SGT John Basilone could have been better done. Whether it was the actor who was at fault or the director is not clear to me but I found him less engaging than the others.

The character of Snafu was also not well done, the actor portraying someone who was less like a man struggling with his sanity and more like a dope-smoking hipster.

Others along the way; Burgie, Captain Haldane, Bill Leyden, Chuckler and Runner are all likeable in their own was and evidence that character development was not as badly done as some have made out. They are all different and none is the archetypical ""marine from central casting"". If that was what people are expecting, they will likely be disappointed.

For me, that is one of the great strengths of the series.

The Blu-ray edition of the series is well worth the price of admission. It is a very good transfer and the subtleties of the lighting and colour palette can be fully appreciated.

For me there is very little missing from the series and, although I bought it without having seen it, I have enjoyed it immensely. It gives a genuinely heart-felt perspective on the terrible price, both physical and psychological, that so many people paid in WWII and so many others.

It deserves not to be judged in comparison with Band of Brothers but as a fine achievement in its own right.",1387756800,2,5408,4.670526315789473

So, because there was no contact with the real men and women who served, it seemed disconnected, even if it was 100 percent accurate, it still seemed a bit of a stretch in places.

What tossed me overboard quickly was a scene on the Naval vessel, sailing to the Pacific for combat in early 1942, and some Marine sitting in the galley asks, ""What are we doing, anyway?"" -or something like that.

I'm sorry.  Hollywood cluelessness.  No Marine, in early 1942, and no American, would have been asking what they are doing here.. not after Pearl Harbor, its just not happening.  So, that was like a stereotype Viet Nam era remark from a Hollywood writer and not a US Marine in 1942.

1165725,5,6305837325,"The negative: This was a gift, but I didn't have the opportunity to watch it until early August 2013. Disk number Five is defective. I placed it into two different DVD players, and it caused both players to become ""hung up"" after the first introductory picture. No sound either. Other DVDs are playing very well, and the first four DVDs in the series played without incident. Since Disk Five holds the last two episodes of the series, this was a huge disappointment! What is even more disappointing is that Amazon's policy for returns does not cover this expensive boxed set. The set was purchased in February 2013, but Amazon will not honor the return now. And I am a current PRIME customer as well; however, I was not at the time this was purchased. So, I'm uncertain what to do...but I cannot afford to buy another boxed set of the series...and I don't think that it is possible to find only Disk Five for sale.

The positive: The first four DVDs were excellent. Fantastic picture and high quality sound. The movie effects are first rate, and Tom Hanks did a wonderful job of directing. The drama is so realistic that you can sometimes believe that you are actually in the midst of the scenes. Character development was slow compared to ""Band of Brothers"". After the first hour of that series, you knew the characters names and could easily identify them from there on. In ""The Pacific"", it took almost three episodes, before I could even recognize the main characters. However, about time I was really getting into the later episodes, the Disk Number Five issue arose. My father was a Marine in WWII and he passed on in the early nineties. He seldom would talk about the war, but I know that he trained men in the Second Marine Division for the war in the Pacific. He did tell me about Chesty Puller, and also about some of his buddies. I was really looking forward to seeing ""The Pacific"" as a way of remembering him. I guess that won't happen now. At least I got to see Guadalcanal and Peleliu. It helped me to understand my father a lot better.

1165808,4,6305837325,"Like many of those who have an interest in this era I'm sure; I approached The Pacific with the outstanding Band of Brothers (BoB) series in mind. While The Pacific doesn't quite compare with BoB in a number of ways, primarily due to the difference in source material used, it is still a great rendition of the experiences of Marines during WWII. Instead of getting to know almost everybody involved, as you do in BoB, The Pacific is a convergence of a few biographies/autobiographies by or about three Marines whom the series identifies as the main characters. You do certainly learn the names of other characters, but that's only through the interaction of the focused few.

I have had the pleasure of reading one of the books this series was based on, Helmet for My Pillow by Robert Leckie, and although it was an excellent read, making it part of a series like this one may not have been their best choice; due to it being all one person's point of view and not translating well to a non-documentary format in parts. That was one of the many things that made BoB so great IMO; the fact that the information was coming from practically an entire company. Going the route of The Pacific made for a slower, more dramatized experience. I don't mean to imply that as a bad thing, I just want those who haven't seen it to know what to expect.

I'm willing to bet that the majority of people interested in war stories care less about watching soldiers spending time at an insane asylum, or becoming a poster-boy to sell war bonds, than they do about seeing the combat and the heroics surrounding it. I'm not saying all the other stuff should be left out, and as a veteran myself I understand very well what goes on 'behind the scenes' as it were, but unlike BoB I felt that there were several scenes that could've been edited to allow for more time on the battlefield, such as Guadalcanal. For example, large sections of parts 3 & 4 felt like filler to me and could've easily been cut down to one chapter; not cutting scenes completely mind you, just made shorter while still getting the point across. Leave those details for readers who prefers to expand on these experiences through the books.

Despite all this, I still very much enjoyed The Pacific and admit that most of the criticisms I've made are relatively minor, especially when looking at it under its own merits and not compared to Band of Brothers. I highly recommend watching this series at least once to anyone who are WWII aficionados or simply interested in getting a closer look into the lives of a few Marines during their time across the Pacific.",1373500800,,2613,4.579059829059829

1165813,4,6305837325,"I've watched this entire film about five times over the last few years and I always learn something new from it.  It's given me a much greater appreciation of what some of our soldiers went through in the Pacific, although I already had a good idea from my father who was wounded on Luzon on 7 June 1945 at Bayombong during the campaign up the Caguyan Valley. He was the BAR man for his squad in the 129th Infantry Regiment of the 37th Infantry Division and was injured by shrapnel from a Japanese anti-tank round.  Left to die, he was rescued by Philippinos who got him to an aid station upriver by boat.  He won a Combat Infantryman's Badge, A Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. He spent weeks in a stateside hospital and was released with a service-connected injury and an Honorable Discharge.

This brings me to my solitary complaint: why was this only about the Marines?  The U. S. Army played a significant part in the Pacific campaign and did most of the fighting in the Philippines.  Most movies suggest that the war ended at Iwo Jima and Okinawa.  Quite a bit of fighting went on after that, most of it by the Army, and this included the entire liberation of the Philippines, freeing many prison camps, the Battle for Manila, Battle for Baguio and so on, including the capture of General Yamashita.  These are ignored in many military films.

1165933,5,6305837325,"What an astonishing achievement this show is. There are things here I never dreamed I'd see on TV. HBO and all the people behind getting this series made are to be commended.

The mini-series covers the experiences of several marines in the war against Japan in WW2. The war memoirs of Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie form the basis of the screenplay, with several other marines, in particular John Basilone, featured to varying degrees. The common thread is their service in the 1st Marine Division but the men concerned served with different sub-units and in different campaigns (and John Basilone was with the 4th Division for Iwo Jima). Accordingly the series doesn't have the cohesion that was attained in covering the exploits of Easy Company in Band of Brothers. I didn't mind this though. The war in the Pacific was a wide ranging one and its events took place over a much longer time frame than its predecessor was concerned with.

The stand-out feature of The Pacific are the battle scenes. They are grisly, loud and confronting. I never thought I'd see war carnage as graphic as this on TV. The makers have also, across the four campaigns, Guadalcanal, Cape Glouster (on Bouganville), Peleliu and Okinawa shown the battles quite differently. These take into account the different types of actions, tactics and conditions on each island. Each campaign also sees an increase in brutality and this allows the deterioration of the men, particularly Sledge, to be shown to vivid effect. Indeed by the end, the men are sick of war and killing, sick of each other and simply sick. It is a long way from the comraderie of Easy Co.

While I want to concentrate my review on The Pacific, the relationship to Band of Brothers needs to be addressed. I have read many people say The Pacific is not as good. Certainly it has no character as compelling as Dick Winters. I think it is also clear that `Brothers' is more enjoyable but it is in this that the strength of The Pacific lies. It is a far grimmer, visceral and more shocking portrayal of war. On this and several other points, I think The Pacific is more personal and more powerful.

This is a show for adults. Aside from very graphic war violence, there is profane language and sex scenes and concepts. The most confronting element though is the descent into darkness, culminating on Okinawa, where the basic humanity of the characters frays to a thread. It is perhaps an antidote, or at least a reality-check to the glowing/glorifying depiction of war that BOB was at times. A theme common to both series is that though war is horrible, sometimes you get an enemy that simply must be fought. After watching the Pacific you're in no doubt what this entails in its entirety.",1370995200,,2729,4.738947368421052

1165988,5,6305837325,"If you don't like The Pacific because it is vulgar and dirty and turns good men rotten, that might well be because the war in the Pacific was vulgar and dirty and turned good men rotten.

And we can't compare fighting the Germans to fighting the Japanese. Look at the PW survival rates--- 3 percent of Americans in Nazi PW camps died, same as other Western nationalities. But 25% of Americans in Japanese PW camps died. It was a different kind of war, and any movie about it will be a different kind of movie. Complaints about bad language? Good Grief. Do you think you are watching a movie about summer camp, or a Girl Scout Jamboree?

The language was pretty much like what I remembered from my 3 years in the 1st Marine Division, and that was stateside in the 70s.

I think most have it backwards: If you watch a war movie and don't hear constant profanity, then you are not hearing the real thing.

One improvement: Make it easier to tell Leckie from Sledge. They did look alike, pale skin and red hair, especially in the first few episodes.

No matter which series you prefer, however, ie, Band or Pacific, you have to appreciate the struggles our soldiers went through AND came out of.

1166135,3,6305837325,"How long has it been since there was a World War II movie covering the Pacific Campaign?
Why is this supremely signifigant front of the war continually ignored in favor of a prolific quantity of films portraying the war as it was in European and North African settings?

This is a fairly adequate depiction of the Pacific Campaign as seen from the view-point of three Marines who experienced it: Eugene Sledge, Robert Leckie, and ""Manilla John"" Basilone. Leckie and Sledge both wrote extensively on their experiences, and their books are classics of combat history, still popular with Marines today.

This is an ""adequate"" rendering of the historical record, ...but with some grave reservations:

-Too much emphasis is placed on almost every aspect of the particular individual's experiences, EXCEPT the battles.
-The battle scenes that ARE included are rather ""subdued"", not unlike war-movies of the 1960s and earlier.
-In the Pacific Campaign, the Japanese Imperial Army and Navy were the opposing combatants: Japanese troops are BARELY and RARELY depicted in this mini-series!

Now, for anyone who knows a veteran of this war, especially a Marine Corps veteran, or anyone who has thoroughly read the history, ...this mini-series is going to be a disappointment to say the least. The Japanese were an adversary who went to great lengths to engage their opponents as close as possible. This is also true of the Marines. Much of the fighting was close-combat within the defensive fortifications of one side or the other, savage mayhem with blades, butt-stocks, entrenching-tools, and bare-hands. Quite simply, the combat was often too grusome and barbaric for Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks to stomach, ...so we get this quasi soap-opera rather than a war movie.

Tom Hanks made some unforgiveable remarks on the ""racial"" aspect of the war against Japan:
Apparently, the ONLY reason America warred against Japan, ...is because ""they are a different race, and have a different culture"", or some nonsense. To say that tommy missed the point (ENORMOUSLY) is beyond words.

Well, tommy, there WAS an ugly racial aspect to this war, ...and America DID NOT START IT!

As the grandson of a World War II Marine, and a Marine myself, I acknowledge that the Japanese fighting-man did fight bravely and fanatically. Of that, there is no doubt. However, the Empire of Japan DID NOT fight an honorable campaign (except in their own eyes). The TRUE record of brutality, slaughter, slavery, and genocide is STILL an open festering wound to every nation on the Pacific Rim that was over-run, conquered, and occupied by the Empire of Japan. Any American hostilities that went ""too far"" are quite miniscule when compared to Japan's treatment of civilians and captured Allied military-personnel. I myself have always admired the Japanese, and I have known several Japanese people as friends. But even my friends from Japan acknowledge that their nation fought an unjust campaign!

A REBUTTAL OF IDIOTS AND CENSORSHIP:
...Some cowardly little PUNK keeps deleting my commentary in regard to the retarded, ill-informed comments made by yet another punk.

I'm going to keep on typing up my reply, no matter how many times un-Constitutional feces try to prevent me from excercizing my 1st. Amendment RIGHT to Freedom of Expression, ...especially when I am citing HISTORICAL FACT:

-The Allies bombed civilian areas in Japan, ...but Japan began the war by conducted unrestricted bombardment, with no distinction between military and civilians. In fact, they INTENTIONALLY killed mass numbers of civilians in every nation they invaded, especially China.

_Japan ALSO had a nuclear weapons program, and had EVERY INTENTION of using them just as soon as they could create them.

America beat both Japan and Germany in the race for an atomic bomb. The Japanese atomic bomb project was headed by physicists Yoshio Nishina and Busaku Arakatsu. A test or their prototype was scheduled for 12-Aug-1945, in th evicinity of Hamhung, Korea.

America had NO choice but to use their atomic bombs, ...the other option was an invasion of the Japan itself, in which the government was preparing the civilian population for suicidal resistance that would have resulted in astronomical casualties for both sides, but especially the Japanese civilian populace.

-With the exception of the bombing campaigns, which were RETALIATION for Japan's INTENTIONAL and gratuitous targeting of civilians from day one, Allied forces on the ground went to great effort to avoid civilian casulaties. This is particularly clear during the battle for Saipan.

The Japanese army however, repeatedly inflicted all manner of excessive slaughter on civilians. The siege and capture of Nanking comes to mind, where tens of thousands of Chinese people were machine-gunned en masse, bayoneted, or fired upon with heavy weapons. Enormous numbers of women were raped. This behavior occurred in every city over-run by Japanese forces, it was not unique to the battle of Nanking.

-The American citizens of Japanese ancestry who were interred in camps during World War 2 were well-fed, properly housed, and recieved medical care. Those citizens or their surviving descendants recieved monetary compensation and an apology from the United States government, eventually.

Prisoners of the Japanese did not fare nearly so well: Allied P.O.W.s were subjected to death-marches, mass execution or summary execution, torture, and slave-labor. Those are considered war-crimes, by the way. Allied prisoners, when liberated, were found starving to death, diseased, and generally emaciated. Many of those prisoners died shortly after liberation. Civilian populations under Japanese rule were exploited and abused in this manner on a much larger scale.

-The Japanes government established a system of brothels for their military personnel. These facilities were staffed by women from the occupied nations under Japanese rule. Thousands of women and girls were forcibly taken from their homelands and used as sex-slaves. Korean women appear to have been exploited in this system more than all other nationalities.

-Then we have Unit 731, headed by Colonel Shiro Ishi. This organization operated a facility in Manchuria that conducted experiments in biological and chemical warfare. Thousands of civilians and Allied P.O.W.s were exposed to biological and chemical agents. The test subjects were examined by scientists and doctors, ...who subjected the victims to VIVISECTION in order to examined the effects. This is the dissection of LIVING, CONCSIOUS test-subjects, ...NO ANESTHETIC applied. This was done to men, women, and children.

This is HISTORICAL FACT. Some of the victims of these atrocities are still alive, all over East Asia. The government of Japan has NEVER acknowledged these deeds, to this very day. America, on the other hand, ...isn't allowed to forget when it had a fine for an overdue library book.

The younger generations of Japanese citizens are very different people than their grandfathers who served in the Imperial Armed Forces of Japan. But they are not informed of any of these things. All they are taught about World War 2, ...is that they were bombed by America.

Thats all leftists in America know about World War 2 as well, ...yet they put on such an ostentatious and sanctimonious airs of being so much more ""informed"". Put down the bong and pick up a book.",1364601600,14,7411,5.26802374893978

When I was ready to watch The PACIFIC (on Feb 15), the discs WOULD NOT LOAD on my Blu-Ray player.  I then upgraded the firmware in my player... The discs still would NOT load.  So... I went out and bought a NEW Blu-Ray player which contained the latest and greatest firmware.  The discs now load ok - but after about 7-8 minutes of play - the discs stop as if the player is in perpetual ""pause"" mode.  I must then power my Blu-Ray player OFF and then ON again.  This happens over and over with every one of the discs.  Other Blu-Ray discs play just fine, and yes I have tested these defective discs in other Blu-Ray players with the same result - the screen freezes up after a few minutes of play.

I attempted to return these for refund or exchange, however I discovered that I have exceeded the allowable time for returning.  So, I will toss my ""The PACIFIC"" discs away and live and learn....  That's why I'm posting this review.  Please TEST your discs as soon as you receive them.",1361404800,,1247,4.318965517241379

NOT FOR THE SQUEAMISH!  Some nudity/sexuality and much worse in terms of violence and gore than 'B.o. B' !!!!!

After watching Pacific, I was compelled to return BoB to my DVD player for a comparison.  BoB, in my conclusion, is a far more entertaining narrative and gives more artistic liberties than Pac, which is more documentary-style and flows closer to real-life than BoB.  Character development was a little shallow in Pac. as there are simply too many characters to follow to get to know them very well.  However, any fan of war documentaries will find the day-to-day of these Pacific marines well-researched and fascinating!  A must see!!!!",1360713600,,786,5.149606299212598

Forget all the blathering by right wingers, this shows the horrible conditions faced by Marines in the Pacific, honors their bravery and courage, and makes it plain that fighting the Japanese could be a lot more brutal than fighting the ""civilized"" Germans.  One thing I miss with this is a lack of coverage of Navy and naval battles.  You only get a sense of what is going on in the water on a few occasions. While this is not completely historically accurate--it is a composite based on several classic WWII memoirs--it does a good job with its source material.

I was especially saddened at how war affected the individual psyche of the participants and how it carried over into the personal lives of those who survived.

Instead of concentrating on our guys getting the very unpleasant duty of war done in the stoic manor that that generation had, it concentrates on making our troops look weak spirited, whiney, undisciplined, and just plain mean spirited to the enemy wounded. While there were some instances of that kind of behavior, the majority were not like that. The Japanese enemy, meanwhile are shown in a very sympathetic manner. THEY are brave, tenacious fighters.

I wasn't impressed with some of the acting; it could have been a little better. The battles scenes were very well done. It showed what it was like over there at that time.
Compared to Band of Brothers (which is one of my favorite shows to watch!) this was pretty smutty. I'm sure the way it was portrayed in the series is what really happened over there for a lot of the men but they didn't have to dwell on those as much. Also, compared to Band of Brothers you didn't get to know the characters in the story that much. It was a little too impersonal.

No combat vet could buy into this; walking through an area with possible enemy presence and bunching up as those troops did is WRONG!  Machine guns firing in LONG bursts is a sure way to burn out the barrel of an a/ir cooled weapon.  The use of grenades was notably absent until the end, and so on and so on.

The story, which focuses of course on some of the actual participants, the veterans, is sometimes difficult to watch because it is true, but likewise, impossible to turn away from. I had relatives who served in the Pacific War. I feel it is important, especially as one who was fortunate enough not to have to go to war, and who so far have children also fortunate enough not to, to understand, or at least try to understand the horrors they experienced.

1166466,3,6305837325,"I was somewhat disappointed by this set. The characters I found hard to follow from film to film, and they are too often busy with marginal maneuvering around Australian chicks than fighting the Japanese. OK that is part of the story of the Pacific war, but I feel too much time has been devoted here to peripheral aspects of the campaign.

The rhetoric is a bit excessive, to the points where it detracts from the overall credibility of the work.

Special effects are also OK, could have been better with available technology for sure.

In the end one is left wondering: is this a fictional account, in which case it is too convoluted and lack focus? Or is it a historical rendering of the war, in which case there is too much that is left out?

Overall still worth watching but don't expect too much in terms of either a good story (like for Band of brothers) or a good documentary.

The extra DVD on Peleliu is mostly a few interviews with veterans. OK but a series like this should have devoted much more to this pivotal battle, second only to Iwo Jima and Okinawa for the Pacific war.",1357603200,,1089,4.452261306532663

It discourages the kind of glib generalizations that are all too common in other accounts of these battles.  It is well worth ordering Leckie's ""Helmet for my Pillow,"" and Sledge's ""With the Old Breed..."" to read in parallel.

To be sure, there's a price to pay for coming in second place.

I've heard it said before that the war in the Pacific was really just a big race war.  Of course, I wasn't there; but from what I've seen of media depictions of the Japanese- not just as an enemy we were at war with but as an entire race of people; and hearing firsthand testimony from WWII veterans, I believe this was true.  And this program was not shy in depicting it.  I'm not saying I enjoy seeing racism... of course, I think it is reprehensible.  But as a historian, I'm glad to see the past depicted as it really was rather than in ways that are just about making us feel comfortable.

Pacific"" is one of the two best war films I have ever seen. (The other one was ""The Thin Red Line."")
""The Pacific"" is a no nonsense, realistic, unsentimental, portrayal of the horror of island fighting the  Marines experienced against the formidable Japanese, and the effect the war had on the American
survivors after the fighting was done.  The miniseries is just excellent!",1353196800,,475,4.7560975609756095
1166687,4,6305837325,"As a former US Marine, I am always skeptical of war films purporting to be about Marines. Marines have a way of thinking and acting that is hard for actors - (for anyone) - to grasp. If you're a Marine or former Marine watching some actor botch up his role as a ""Marine"" it ruins your experience of a film. Case in point: Eastwood was fine in Heartbreak Ridge but the actors with him resembled US Marines as much as they did small brown furry creatures from Alpha Centauri.

Pacific, however, does not suffer from that weakness. These actors were subjected to a nine-day ""boot camp"" before filming. Who ever ""trained"" them did a stellar job. These guys talk, walk, and act like Marines. The weakness the film *does* suffer from is lack of cohesion. Perhaps even a cinematic genius like Spielberg couldn't figure out how to get around a loose story line with battles fought all over the Pacific. Another weakness is the depiction of the Guadalcanal fire fight that occasioned John Basilone's receipt of the Medal of Honor. That fight as filmed needed hundreds more assaulting Japanese; as portrayed, it seems merely like a hellish-tough skirmish. I also found the episode devoted to John Basilone's romance tiresome. I don't know why, I just did.

Also, the date given in the film for the Battle of Peleliu is wrong: it shows the Marines hitting the beaches of Peleliu in ""October"" whereas the actual assault commenced in September. (Spielberg committed a similar odd and easily checked historical error in his outstanding film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lincoln/dp/B00C1BU7V8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lincoln</a>, by the way.)

Those are the only cons (for me). The idea this film somehow is ""anti-American"" --- (same critique was leveled at Saving Private Ryan) --- seems to me an inaccurate cavil. Clearly the WWII Pacific US Marine veterans who met with the actors during this film's production did not regard it so; rather, they viewed it as an honor to their service. Marines pride themselves on fairness when fairness is called for and mercilessness when mercilessness is called for. In the Pacific, mercilessness was called for.

The pros are the film is historically accurate, has immense detail, portrays the Corps accurately, and is enjoyable, sometimes impressive, to watch. My favorite episodes deal with the horrific fighting on Okinawa. Eugene Sledge remarked of that fighting, (roughly quoted): ""It was beyond ludicrous that anyone could endure those conditions for long and not go completely insane"".

The series is built around three Marines - John ""I'm staying with my boys"" Basilone, Robert Leckie, and Eugene Sledge - and the historical memoirs of the latter two:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Helmet-for-My-Pillow/dp/0553763598/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Helmet for My Pillow</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/With-the-Old-Breed/dp/0553230557/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">With the Old Breed</a>.

If you are a Marine, Marine veteran, a Marine family member, or just interested in increasing your vicarious first hand knowledge of the Pacific War, this is a graphic, realistic film I believe you will appreciate.",1353196800,6,3279,5.722792607802875
1166688,1,6305837325,"First, I'm NOT going to compare this to BOB.  This series should stand on its own and, quite honestly, it comes up short.  Far short.

For me, the biggest issue is that the main characters weren't well defined early on.  It wasn't clear which were the ""main three"" until quite late in the series.  I found it difficult to tell them apart -- it would have helped if each had been given some distinguishing feature.  When there was a battle scene and someone died, I found myself wondering who it was until we finally got to a daylight scene and I could (usually) figure out who was missing.

Which brings me to the large number of night scenes and the chaos that ensued in most of the battle scenes.  There's no doubt that war is chaotic.  However, the challenge for screenwriters and directors is to focus that chaos -- to keep the viewer's attention focused on a character or an issue or something so that we have a thread to follow through the fog and chaos.  Instead, there was a constant theme of lots of people running around, lots of people being blown to bits and little sense of what was happening to whom.  I found myself admiring the special effects rather than actually getting ""into"" the battles -- and when you start thinking about SFX in a movie, the director has lost you.

I agree that there is an anti-American bias that doesn't do our vets justice.  No one is suggesting that the American GIs were perfect.  But, other than the one scene in which the Japanese use civilians as human shields, we aren't privy to the atrocities committed by the Japanese, only those ostensibly committed by Americans.  We are repeatedly told the Americans must ""kill the Japs"" but not told that it was dishonorable for Japanese to surrender and, on many islands, nearly every Japanese soldier would fight to the death rather than be captured (taking as many Marines with him as possible).

Finally, the movie suggests that most Marines came back scarred for life by their experiences. My father was a WWII Marine.  He, like the overwhelming majority of WWII vets, returned to a grateful nation, settled down, went to college on the GI BIll (many of them), got jobs, married (or not), had kids (or not), and went on to live productive lives.

The Marines who sacrificed so very much in the Pacific, including the far too many who never made it home, deserve better than this effort.  If The Pacific was meant to ""honor"" them someone needs to teach Hanks/Spielberg the meaning of honor.",1352592000,22,2483,4.61503416856492

And like in Game of thrones, favorite characters die early and often.

1166734,5,6305837325,"For those who are WWII buffs or those just interested in learning more about the Pacific theater, this series is absolutely incredible (albeit taking mature content into account). This is just as good the it's sister series, Band of Brothers, which in my opinion set the standard for war docu-dramas. This series is one of the most accurate portrayals of the experiences of those who fought in the PTO, and just how brutal and unforgiving the combat and environment was there. I'm not really sure if people anymore really understand just how brutal the PTO was for the everyday Marine on the ground since most of the time people are taught about ETO more so than the PTO, well, other than the dropping of the A-bombs. The Marines in the PTO faced unforgiving terrain and an unforgiving and proud enemy, and this series clearly and graphically brings this to life.

Sometime ago I watched Ken Burn's documentary ""The War"" again (which is a phenomenal series in of itself), and so many of the individuals discussed in that documentary are characters in this series. For me personally, knowing the history and stories from Burn's documentary made this series and the characters all of the more real for me. For those into Ken Burn's stuff, I would watch ""The War"" and then watch this series, and I believe you won't be disappointed.

1166778,5,6305837325,"The Pacific is a documentary style mini-series that captures the essence of the epic struggle of the island fighting campaign during WWII.  Tom Hanks and Stephen Spielberg are to be complemented on bringing this story to life and doing it in such a way that the viewer can better understand just how horrific that struggle was.  As the story unfolds and we follow the lives of the characters as they face unimaginable situations, we the viewers are confronted with our own fears and are forced to ask...how would I have reacted under the same situations?  HBO has done an outstanding job in capturing these kinds of stories.  The mini series format is the only way to provide the kind of depth and character development this large of a story requires.  The Pacific is truly an epic not only in the telling of the Pacific war, but in bringing to life the characters who lived it.  Most other movies and even documentaries tend to dwell on the strategic efforts of the war.  This series tells the story of the individual GI...Marine...Sailor...the men who had to fight it...the men who had to die for it. It's their story placed within the context of actual events...times...and places. The historical accuracy is pretty good, even so...as a movie series, certain generalizations had to be made for story continuity and brevity.  I loved the way at the end how we were told how the lives of the characters continued on after the war...but what most impressed me about this series was how much better now can I visualize what my dad went through during his adventures on Okinawa.  Although I've always had great respect for our WWII veterans...that respect was elevated to a higher platform because of this series.",1343001600,4,1711,4.792517006802721
1166779,5,6305837325,"This series is surprising in many ways. This is not and cannot be the official vision of the war in the Pacific against Japan. For one it does not show Pearl Harbor and the battle about entering the war. It is not really historical in that way and it does not reflect at all the racial integration Roosevelt was able to assert and impose in the US armed forces then. The political issue is also avoided that way and not one single black GI appears in that series. The only two blacks seem to be the servants of the doctor in Mobile.

The second surprise is the fact that the series follows a set of young men and women who find themselves together in the same Marines corps or unit and fight together all along. Most of them will survive and only one really dies on the screen. It is thus a series about a handful of GIs who survived the war, except one, John Basilone, a hero of the very first battles, without really wanting to be one and realizing the importance of the fight when it was occurring, who got a medal of honor for that heroism then and was sent back to the US to help sell war bonds and train marines but decided to go back and this time play hero as a sergeant and gets killed, seven months after marrying, just before going back to the front, another marines sergeant working in the catering services of the training center to which he was attached.

In fact the series, all along, follows these few men from before the war to after the war and the emphasis is contrastive: the romanticism of before the war, particularly Eugene Sledge who nearly did not go because of some physical condition, the horror of the war, and the full resignation and disgust expressed by Eugene after the war: ""We only learned one thing, to kill Japs and I must admit I have become very good at that.""

Each episode of the series centers on one character or on one battle or situation. Each chapter thus tries to depict and render one problem, positive or negative. One character who loses his physical and mental sanity and has to be sent to the psychiatric ward of the military hospital and that enables us to discover the squalid horror of such a war on some men who are lost forever and are taken care of, that is to say are more or less forced to go on living in their insanity.

Or it is a resting period in Melbourne Australia and the relations these young men entertain with the local population, particularly of course the sexual dimension of these relations, with a particular emphasis on one case which is a real love affair and yet has to be called off because the young marine has to go back to the front and the relation has no guarantee to ever have a sequel.

Or it is a battle and each battle insists on one particular element though some come back regularly and repetitively. The battles are nearly always in mud and under rain with the negative sides of this: wet ammunitions for example and living, resting and fighting conditions that have nothing to do with anything physically challenging: it becomes an ordeal, a self-inflicted or at least assumed torturing ""adventure"" (for the positive thinkers) or ""descent to hell"" (for the negative thinkers). But all have in common one point: they can never say and predict that they should or would be alive any minute now and later. Death is the banal condiment of these battles, the salt and sugar of any war.

Or it is the battles on Okinawa and hence with some civilians, very few indeed. A baby here next to his dead mother. An old woman who is severely wounded and wants to die and the marine refuses to do it. A mother with her baby running to the soldiers and begging them to take her child and then detonating herself killing as many marines as possible. Then some evanescent band of civilians going in the opposite direction to that of the marines. That's the worst part missing in this series: the local civilians taken in the war against their will and finding themselves between the Japanese forces and the US marines. They definitely do not look liberated in any way since they are not even shown at all.

So what is the meaning of the series?

It sets the emphasis on the suffering, at times heroic, at times desperate, at times pathetic, at times insane of the marines. It is centered on the marines, the troops that are projected onto the ground from ships and that open up the battle field. The series systematically gives us very gory and repulsive images supposedly depicting the reality of this war for these soldiers or fighters. Corpses, horrible wounds, skeletons here and there in various states of decay, maimed bodies, legs, heads, hands, or whatever other parts of the body missing from the bodies or lying here and there on the path.

It emphasizes the discourse the officers, commissioned or not, use to build the resolve and motivation of the simple soldiers who constantly doubt what they are doing. The extremely black humour of these marines, a condition to their mental survival without which there is no survival at all, is developed and presented as the only human way for these men to cope with their announced and practically sure death. Happy will be those who will survive.

Happy they say? That's a joke. They will build or rebuild their lives, but will that be happiness with the constant recollection of these hellish days in the Pacific, the un-erasable remembrance of the suffering imposed to them and imposed to the enemy, the un-extinguishable guilty memory of all the killing done that cannot be alleviated by the supposed heroic dimension of the fight. For these individual fighters it was a nightmare and it will always remain a nightmare visiting them every night and every day.

So the film is against war, any war. There is no just war. There is no clean war. There is just war and that is a horrible event that should be once and for all banned from human history.

1166781,1,6305837325,"Like may reviewers, I feel the need to preface this by saying, yes, yes a million times, I LOVED ""Band of Brothers.""  BOB is a high water mark, a Holy Grail in WW2 films/TV shows.  ""The Pacific,"" on the other hand, is not.  Though not a total low point, it's close enough to earn a 1 star.  Major problems are many, including the bad writing.  It's weak.  Very little effort was made to interject actual 1940s era words, phrases and slang, and likewise there is a serious lack of ""military speak.""  I served in the armed forces and, trust me, guys in the services are talking military lingo constantly.  So the dialog came off as unauthentic much of the time.  Likewise, the writers failed to create captivating characters.  Much to my dismay, I found the three lead characters--Robert Leckie, John Basilone and Eugene Sledge--all extremely boring to watch for nearly 7 hours.  Leckie and Sledge come across as morose, sullen and depressed most of the time.  Maybe that's what war does to most men, but it was boring as hell to watch.  Too much of the story also takes place in boring locales--stateside, Australia, a psych ward--wasting time and deflating the excitement built up when the men are actually at war.  The acting also seemed sub-par and lifeless, which didn't help bring any spark to the already flatly written characters.  And Jon Seda seems miscast as the legendary real-life Marine hero John Basilone.  Seda bares little resemblance to the actual Basilone and I just didn't buy Seda as this legendarily tough Marine.  There was also too much sex and nudity, which seemed extremely out of place in this series.  And FAR too many displays of stomach-turning blood, guts and gore.  At times it felt like I was watching a grotesque horror movie.  There was absolutely no need to continually wallow in scene after scenes of rotting and decaying Japanese corpses.  The action/war scenes are okay, but far too little to late to elevate this series marred by extremely poor writing, bad acting and questionable producing choices that fails to even come remotely close to the high standard set by Band of Brothers.  Major thumbs down on ""The Pacific.""",1340841600,5,2159,4.809782608695652
1166782,5,6305837325,This series is awesome. The contrast between the war in Europe as depicted in Band of Brothers and the total hell of the war in the Pacific is remarkable. I am a U.S. Marine Corps vet and I endorse this product.,1340323200,13,211,4.170731707317073
1166823,1,6305837325,"Band of Brothers, in my opinion, was one of the best works to ever grace a television set.
The Pacific is not even worth watching.  I quit halfway through.

The cinematography of this series is the only redeeming quality.  However, this does not make up for the complete lack of a plot.

Whereas Band of Brothers used graphic violence only as a means to provide some understanding of the anguish the soldiers went through.  This series uses graphic violence as a novelty.  Then there are the episodes where absolutely NOTHING happens.

Once again, Band of Brothers was amazing.  Furthermore, my grandfather fought in the Pacific, so I also had personal reasons to anticipate this series.  I was let down.",1338854400,3,704,4.848739495798319

1166826,5,6305837325,"I got this a while back on Amazon and just got around to viewing it.  I got it because I loved Band of Brothers and expected this would be just as good.  It didn't disappoint.  The production values are amazing, the actors are great and the suffering of war is tangible.

There are scenes that remind me of Band of Brothers, even some of the dialogue is the same, and I actually liked the familiarity.  I appreciated the fear and the suffering and the savagery of war.  Spielberg and Hanks are very good at picking writers and directors and the ones on The Pacific really come through with a fine story.

There is some political correctness which some viewers might not appreciate.  The Japanese are not seen that often, but there is one scene where a Marine medal of honor winner praises them as determined warriors, etc.  In truth, they were not.  One only needs to watch a documentary on the Bataan Death March to know what kind of warriors they were, not to mention the cowardly sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.  But that stuff aside, it really is a good miniseries.

Compared to Band of Brothers, it doesn't hold up as well.  Band of Brothers takes the viewer from training to D-Day to the German surrender (amazing scenes there) and on to VE-Day, and what happens to everybody afterwards.  The Pacific doesn't do that.  So that was the only thing that disappointed me.  I was hoping for the same kind of set-up.

I did learn a tremendous amount about what the war was like in the Pacific, thanks to the Spielberg/Hanks meticulous attention to detail.

One other important point:  You have a choice on viewing options.  You can choose to play each episode with ""historical background.""  Choose that option.  You will be glad you did because before the segment starts, you will hear from actual Marines who were there, just like in Band of Brothers where you heard from Dick Winters and the others.  This is the best part of the series.  Hearing directly from the actual Marines is humbling and enlightening.  It makes you grateful to the men and women who made it possible to continue the way of life we all enjoy.

One other thing, on disc 6 there are interviews some of the Marines depicted in the episodes.  Wow, what a wonderful collection of interviews with these men, and in the case of the men who'd already died, their families.  This is well-worth the price of the set.  I highly recommend this.

It told the stories of men and military strategies and actions that I had only read about in books and magazines.  Watching this close to real portrayal was gut wrenchingly affective.  I marveled at how the ethos, spirit, and expert combat activity of the infantry marines in WWII is still the foundation of the marine corps' ""fire and maneuver"" doctrine today; only with far more modern and lethal capability in today's corps. The familiar connection that marines have with the navy is very evident in the movie as it is in real life today. I served in the 1970's in some of the same units revealed in the movie, the 7th marines in particular.  Knowing that my six year service in the corps was standing on their great sacrifices and history, affected me deeply and proudly.

I only found out after watching the series and found myself wanting more and so delved into the special features.  There were interviews with the survivors that almost brought tears to my eyes, enthralling making of documentaries and much more that empowered my already vast appreciation of this WWII epic.  The thing that struck me most was the expert use of, and sometimes lack of, colour and camera technique to generate some very gritty realism.  The effects department shines here, when shot there's no spaghetti western like shaking of the body before eccentrically swiveling round and dropping to the ground on behalf of the injured, no, I was genuinely shocked as they dropped like sacks of meat in brutal clouds of red as bullets ripped through them.  The basic horror of the Pacific war is genuinely disturbing here.  It was truly a brutal campaign and the makers of Pacific have outdone themselves in attempting to recreate the bloody, mud caked awfulness.  On top of that the shear weight of quality engaged here; the set-pieces that out-did Saving Private Ryan ten fold by the shear number that were built, the musical score, direction, supremely believable characters and weighty story lines made for an experience like nothing I'd seen before.  I believe it even surpassed Band of Brothers, which was a top quality show in itself.  I came away deeply shocked, touched and in awe of the men that fought those terrible battles.

A story by a man that saw nothing except horror and dishonor in his fellow marines. Others must have written about the war. It' too bad they chose Mr Sledge as their source of information. A Band of Brothers left me with a feeling of pride while showing the horrors of war. The Pacific shows the horrors of war but left me feeling I needed to take a shower. Eugene, the son of a wealthy doctor, went on to become an alcoholic while his less fortunate friend, Sid Phillips, (who wished he could help the wounded at Guadalcanal) came back to become a doctor.

1166899,1,6305837325,"I'm a World War II buff, so I was really looking forward to this min-series.  I was expecting The Pacific to be even better than Band of Brothers, given the advances in film-making technology since that mini-series came out.  What I got instead was a dark, cynical look at America's war in the Pacific.  The marines portrayed in this mini-series are racist, emotionally fragile & morally bankrupt.  Throughout the mini-series, the Japanese are referred to as ""yellow bastards"", ""yellow monkeys"", ""yellow slants"", or ""slant-eyed bastards"".  Oh, and then of course there was my favorite line: ""We're here to kill Japs, aren't we?"".  Now I'm not saying that there weren't Americans with racist attitudes towards the Japanese.  I'm sure there were.  The problem is, Tom Hanks & Steven Spielberg are saying that racism is what defined our war effort against the Japanese.  They're implying that our goal was to eliminate them as a race.  It's as if Hanks & Spielberg went over every episode with a fine-toothed comb (with the exception of the episode that takes place in Australia) & said, ""Do we have someone making a racist comment?  No?  Well put one in there!!!""

One of the main characters is Robert Leckie.  Roughly half-way through the first episode, he is on a troop-transport ship off of Guadalcanal.  His company commander's pre-landing briefing is nothing more than an epithet-filled tirade.  Really?  That's how you prepare your men to go into battle?  You don't tell them about what kind of resistance they might face when they land or how many Japanese soldiers are on the island?  Nothing about the tropical diseases that they might have to deal with?  The scene would be comical if it wasn't so pathetic.

What we also see is marines going crazy when faced with hardships.  Leckie actually winds up in a madhouse.  A minor character named Gibson is in the same madhouse after he tries to kill himself.  Now I'm not saying that the marines didn't face hardships fighting in the Pacific theater.  They had to deal with things that soldiers in North Africa & Europe never had to face.  It's all a question of perspective.  For every marine that cracked up, there were many more that kept it together.  Hanks & Spielberg chose to focus on the former & not the latter.

On Peleliu, we see marines digging the gold out of the teeth of dead Japanese soldiers.  There's even a scene where a marine tries to dig the gold out of the mouth of a Japanese soldier who isn't dead.  The Japanese soldier begins to struggle.  The character of Shelton (i.e. Snafu) calmly walks up to the marine, pushes him out of the way, shoots the Japanese soldier in the head & says, ""Makes it easier.""  Did things like this actually happen?  Yes, I'm sure they did, but again, it boils down to a question of perspective.  It's as if Hanks & Spielberg are only trying to show the very worst behavior that the marines engaged in.

And then of course there are the gratuitous sex scenes.  Now I'm no prude.  I have no problem watching two people simulate having sex as long as it serves the story.  The problem is this: You're doing a ten-part mini-series about the marines who served in World War II.  Each episode is only 45 - 50 minutes.  Why are you devoting so much time to sex scenes?  In Band of Brothers, there was one sex scene in the second-to-last episode that lasted maybe 20 seconds.  What, do think people who watch HBO are that starved for sex?  How many billions of dollars does the porn industry rakes in every year?  You couldn't think of a better way to use that time?  I guess character development wasn't high on the priority list for this mini-series.

One of the main characters is Eugene Sledge.  In the final episode, he is shown coming home from the war & having nightmares.  He tries to get his life back on track by going to a college that is having a registration day.  A girl sitting behind one of the registration desks begins asking him questions about his qualifications.  When it becomes clear Eugene isn't quite measuring up, the girl finally asks him if the Marine Corp taught him anything useful.  Here is his response: ""They taught me to kill Japs.  I got pretty good at it.""  There is a subtle yet insidious message here: Not only did America fight a racist war, but she left her sons unprepared for life once the war was over.  This message is patently false, given that both Leckie & Sledge went to have very successful lives after the war, as did many Pacific veterans.

Another issue I had was with the night-time sequences (in particular, the battle sequences).  Yes, I understand that it was very dark & the creators of the mini-series wanted to make it look as realistic as possible.  However, there's also an entertainment factor to be considered.  And it's difficult to be entertained when you're constantly saying to yourself, ""I can't see what's going on.  The screen is black.""  I found it to be very frustrating.  Another problem was with the pacing.  For example, in the first episode, we see Leckie saying goodbye to his father at a bus station as he heads off for boot camp.  The next time we see him, he's on a troop transport ship off of Guadalcanal.  Well what happened in between?  What was Marine Corp boot camp like for him?  Did he get in trouble with his drill instructors?  That would have been more interesting to see than the gratuitous sex scenes.

Anyone who didn't know much about World War II would come away from this mini-series believing that the Americans were the bad guys.  So why would Tom Hanks & Steven Spielberg - two men who are supposedly great admirers of WWII veterans - do a mini-series with such a negative tone?  I think the answer can be found in comments Tom Hanks made during a Time magazine interview when The Pacific came out in 2010: ""Back in World War II, we viewed the Japanese as `yellow, slant-eyed dogs' that believed in different gods. They were out to kill us because our way of living was different. We, in turn, wanted to annihilate them because they were different. Does that sound familiar, by any chance, to what's going on today?"".  What Tom Hanks is referred to is the way many Americans view Muslims today.  Mr. Hanks, like all of leftist Hollywood, believes that Americans want to exterminate all Muslims because they are different than us.  In other words, the way we view Muslims today is no different than the way we viewed the Japanese 70 years ago.  It was wrong then & it's wrong now.  And how best to communicate that message?  Do a mini-series like The Pacific.

The World War II generation is passing into history.  Of the 16 million men & women who served, only about 2 million are still alive today (with about 2,000 dying every day).  They've been referred to as the greatest generation.  I don't agree with that assessment.  To me, the greatest generation was the one that gave our foundational documents (i.e. the Declaration of Independence & the Constitution).  The World War II generation was an important generation with one major flaw: They gave birth to the baby boomers, perhaps the most selfish & self-righteous generation of Americans.  And who are two of the most prominent member of the baby-boomer generation?  Yep, you guessed it, Tom Hanks & Steven Spielberg.",1331251200,18,7275,4.666666666666667
1166900,1,6305837325,"I was pretty upset once I got three disks in on The Pacific.  I was expecting something akin to Band of Brothers since it was billed as such.  What I found was that I got to watch people stare off into space, sit in the rain, run around Melbourne being drunk and sleeping with girls, shoot themselves while naked in the jungle, and basically go crazy.  I'm all about having a more ""realistic"" series that shows the hardships of war aside from getting shot at and seeing your friends killed.  It is VERY GOOD to try to fit that in.  But The Pacific takes it to the point of hardly showing why the men were there in the first place.  Most of the time is spent watching them do nothing.  Granted, that's what a LOT of actual war is.  Doing nothing in a very uncomfortable environment.  However, when we get down to it, this is entertainment not a documentary.  It would be a poor documentary at that.  Finally, when they DO show actual WAR it's pretty hard to tell what is actually going on.  Part of the time it is night and I couldn't tell one character from another.  Part of the time it is day but they spend most of their time running amid explosions and gunfire.  I've seen that before.

Basically what I'm trying to say is that Band of Brothers did a pretty good job of mixing the training, planning, transport, supply, maneuvering, waiting, combat, and recover aspects of the war that the characters had to go through.  We got to see a fairly decent and realistic view in an abridged format while also being entertained in the ways expected.

The Pacific does not deliver to nearly that degree.  So in closing, if you're in to watching people sit and think about their plight when you don't really understand the full measure of that plight, go for it.  If you actually want to see the full scope of what they went through and not just the rain, mud, heat, and bugs then I'd suggest something else.

EDIT:  And I know I'm going to get railed because I shouldn't ""compare it to Band of Brothers"".  Please don't be that absurd.  It was made by the same people and advertised as such to gain a wider audience.  EVERYONE I KNOW who has ever wanted to watch The Pacific ONLY wants to watch it because it is a war series that they expect to be like Band of Brothers but in the Pacific Theatre.  EVERYONE.  So it HAS to be compared.",1331078400,3,2330,4.348027842227379

Band of Brothers was a bit better in this regard.  This one, because of the lack of engagement, spent whole episodes following guys in more mundane stuff just to give the audience something more...character development, drama, change of scenery, etc...

It revolved around 3 marines and their stories and struggles.  This series focused a lot on the toll the war took on the characters and was an extremely emotional experience.  The vicious nature of the Pacific side of WWII is exposed in this story and really made me appreciate the sacrifices our heroes have made.  Though I have always been in awe of our soldiers' sacrifices (my grandfather is a WWII vet and fought in the Pacific), actually seeing depictions of the war in the Pacific was something else.  I found myself emotionally involved with the characters, feeling their pain and fear.  I loved it so much that I immediately went out and read one of the autobiographies that the series was based on.  HBO did such a great job creating visuals for what I read in the book that I can only assume ""The Pacific"" was an extremely realistic depiction.

Yes, the battle scenes are fantastic, but there are certain parts that make me feel as if I'm watching a love drama in a war setting rather than a war story. Basilone's story is a major disappointment for me. It was emotional (I almost cried, I have to admit) but too much time was used to show his love story with Lena that if I didn't do my research I wouldn't know what he did in battle and how heroic he was. Most people don't know much about what happened in the Pacific as compared to in Europe during WWII. This could have been a perfect chance to tell people more about it. But no. The war in the Pacific lasted for 3 years, there are a lot of materials to work on, a lot of information that need to be shown. I understand that 10 episodes can't cover all of them, but why so many unnecessary parts when they could have been used to show more about the war itself instead? Production value-wise, this is still a very good show, better than many war movies out there and I'll recommend it to other people, but it's not something I'll spend $50 on.

1166905,4,6305837325,"August 1942. The United States Marine Corps lands in force on the island of Guadalcanal and begins the long, gruelling campaign of 'island-hopping'. Over the next three years they will take the fight against Japanese forces on islands all across the western Pacific, drawing ever closer to the Japanese home islands and victory.

The Pacific is HBO's companion series to their acclaimed 2001 series Band of Brothers. Like the earlier series, The Pacific follows American soldiers across a single theatre of war (albeit a far vaster one). Unlike Band of Brothers, which was able to concentrate on a single company of the 10st Airborne and cover its journey in some detail (the whole series, bar the opening training sequence, only spanned nine months), The Pacific is rather diffuse in its focus. It covers a period of three years and the almost modular nature of the war in the Pacific (multiple major battles raging simultaneously on islands hundreds of miles apart) means it is impossible to focus on one unit throughout the whole war. The series copes with the problem by dividing the narrative into three storylines following three marines (John Basilone, Bob Leckie and Eugene Sledge), but this ultimately proves to be a move with mixed success.

Plaudits first. The Pacific is visually stunning. Filmed on location on Australia's Pacific coast, the series employs impressive location filming, practical special effects and CGI enhancements to depict WWII combat on-screen more viscerally and in a more convincing manner even than Band of Brothers. The Pacific really does look and sound like a movie, especially on Blu-Ray, and as an audio/visual experience is always impressive. The lead actors - Joseph Mazzello, James Badge Dale and Jon Seda as Sledge, Leckie and Basilone respectively - are impressive and are lent able support by the likes of William Sadler (as the infamous Colonel 'Chesty' Puller) and Rami Malek, who gives an offbeat but fascinating performance as 'Snafu' Shelton. In terms of direction, production values and acting, the series is overwhelmingly impressive.

The issues arise from structural choices for the series. The Pacific War was a very different beast to the Western Front of WWII in Europe, spanning vaster distances and featuring the marines, navy and army fighting simultaneously on different fronts. An immediate drawback of only having ten episodes to tell this story is that other units and services outside the Marine Corps get short shrift. None of the immense naval battles in the theatre (Midway, the Coral Sea etc) are really mentioned and the massive American bombing campaign against Japan is not featured. There are some nods to the other services (the Battle of Savo Island is briefly watched by the marines from the shore; aerial assaults on Japanese positions are occasionally shown) but the focus is squarely on the marines.

Even this is problematic. To get across the scale of the conflict, HBO conflates three separate stories together. John Basilone's story allows them to show life on the home front (Basilone was sent home after Guadalcanal, initially serving as a PR representative to raise money for the war and later as a marine instructor before returning to the field during the battle for Iwo Jima), whilst Bob Leckie is used to cover the initial stages of the fighting and also the role of Australia in the conflict. After Leckie is wounded and forced to return home, Eugene Sledge steps up as our principal POV character and we see most of the latter stages of the war through his eyes. This baton-passing approach to the narrative sounds good but ultimately feels disjointed, as the three soldiers' paths never cross (aside a fictitious brief meeting between Sledge and Leckie). It also complicates things by giving us three different sets of supporting characters to also get to know, which is a tall order for just ten episodes.

Which isn't to say that what we are left with is still not compelling. The actors do a great job of selling their characters' respective storylines: Leckie is left on the front lines a little too long and begins suffering from battle fatigue; Basilone is tired of being hailed a hero at home whilst his friends are still fighting and is anxious to return to the front; and Sledge is angry at missing out the start of the war due to poor health and is keen to prove himself, only to ultimately start losing perspective as the gruelling months of combat unfold. These are familiar storylines, but are given added depth and weight by being true (all three marines are real, and Leckie and Sledge's memoirs provide the basis for the series).

The overwhelming feeling of the series is one of despair. The fighting is savage and without quarter, and the marines often feel that their fighting and dying over specks of land in the middle of nowhere is pointless. There is a lack of any type of grand strategic overview which is true to the experience of the soldiers on the ground. Notably, there is no equivalent to the Why We Fight episode of Band of Brothers (where the 101st liberates a concentration camp and their horrific experiences harden their resolve to help destroy the Nazi regime). The marines are left feeling bereft of a purpose, which makes the horrors they experience strike home even harder. It's no wonder that many of them are shown breaking down or needing urgent time away from the front to reorient themselves. HBO should be congratulated for not downplaying these angles, but it often makes for very hard viewing.

The Pacific (****) is ultimately worth watching. It's a stunning production that makes some hard comments about war and its ultimate savagery, even when a war is worth fighting. It doesn't glorify war and shows its horrors in full force, which can make for hard viewing, but the superior acting and writing make it compelling. Structurally the series is disjointed, and would have benefitted from a tighter focus on maybe just one or two of the marines featured. Extending it to three stretches the story almost to breaking point. However, once you adjust to the structural issues the series is an impressive piece of work. It is available now on DVD (UK, USA) and Blu-Ray (UK, USA).",1329609600,2,6221,4.953065134099617

1166964,4,6305837325,"The Pacific Theater interests me more than the European, probably because my Dad was a WW2 Marine and because I heard stories about it from other Pacific veterans.  I suppose it is almost a matter of worship for me, because the Dads on my block were almost all Marine and Navy veterans of WW2.  I have also read extensively on the subject.  That being said, this is a very well told video rendition of the Pacific War.  The gear is authentic.  The acting is very good.  The battle scenes are so vivid and violent that I wanted them to end.

However, I think that the Marines are portrayed as being less likable in this series than were the soldiers in ""Band of Brothers.""  They are often brutal, but the brutality of the Japanese, which engendered the Marines' response, is not adequately explored. There are three main characters Leckie, Sledge, and Basilone. In the case of Sledge, the Marines in his unit are depicted as being quite different than the people described by Sledge in his memoir, ""With The Old Breed.""  Indeed, it is hard to find a hero in either Sledge's or Leckie's units.  There were many scenes in the series which were recognizable interpretations of incidents in Sledge's memoir, but in almost every case, the Marines were depicted as being more brutal than depicted by Sledge, and/or the justification of the Marines' violent reaction was omitted.  For instance, in one scene of the video, Sledge and his buddy accost a Japanese POW on a muddy trail and are only prevented from harming him by officers.  In Sledge's book, the POW initiated the confrontation by stepping into the path of the Marines, taking an aggressive stance, and refusing to budge. I haven't re-read Leckie's book, ""Helmet For My Pillow"" since I watched the video, so I can't speak how close the video followed Leckie's story, but Leckie does not come across as a particularly admirable person in the series.  Of the three main characters only John Basilone comes across as a true hero.  Yes, at first he drinks and womanizes when off duty, but he never falters in performing his duty.

The baseball game scene at the end of ""Band Of Brothers"" was a masterful way to complete the series, and ""The Pacific"" ends with individual wrap-ups of the lives of the surviving characters and/or their relatives.  It was not as touching, but the format of the series made it necessary.

""Band of Brothers"" did not attempt to take the viewer through the war from the first US ground campaign to its end the way ""The Pacific"" did.  I think that ""The Pacific"" should have been told the way ""Band of Brothers"" was - as one unit's struggle through the war from that unit's first campaign to its last.

The musical score is definitely not memorable, either.

So to summarize, this was the greatest video/series/movie ever made about the Pacific War, but it could have been better.",1327190400,3,2856,4.7082494969818915

1167018,5,6305837325,"""The Pacific"" follows the fortunes of the 1st Marine Division as it fights its way across the north-western Pacific, clearing the Japanese Army from the many tiny islands in the region in what were probably some of the most intense, brutal and physically and mentally sapping batles of the second world war. It is based largely on the memoirs of two of the characters,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robert-Leckie-s-Helmet-for-my-Pillow/dp/0091937515/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robert Leckie's Helmet for my Pillow</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eugene-Sledge-s-With-the-Old-Breed/dp/0091937523/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eugene Sledge's With the Old Breed</a>.

The series, which ran during 2010, comprises of ten episodes, and they cover four of the major encounters of the campaign (Guadalcanal, Pelelieu, Iwo Jima and Okinawa) as well as the Division's time in Melbourne. The Pacific proves, conclusively in my opinion, that a) the war movie is not dead and b) it is not necessarily cheapened by the TV series format. Billed as a sister series to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Band-Of-Brothers/dp/B003YCOIFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Band Of Brothers</a>, and produced by Spielberg and Hanks, it does, of course beg the comparison with its predecessor and with justification; The Pacific displays, gloriously, that impeccable heritage in its vision and execution.

The first point of note is the camera work which is magnificent with majestic, sweeping pans to show the wide picture of the battles and urgent, vital close-ups which put the viewer right into the ball-clenching centre of some unspeakably frightening battle scenes. These battles are wonderfully choreographed and if you can imagine the Omaha landing scene from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Private-Ryan/dp/B003LVZYL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Private Ryan</a>, reproduced many times over and on a bigger scale, you will have some idea of how these scenes come across. The attention to detail and historical accuracy is jaw-dropping. It would perhaps be a little crass to mention the cost, but it is easy to understand why The Pacific, at $200m, was at the time (and still is?) the most expensive television series ever created by any network. The money was well spent!

It is inevitable that a subject such as this will rely heavily on CGI to fill in the historical spaces between actors and props, particularly during the battle scenes. These scenes seem to have a slightly sepia-toned look which may be there, in part, to blur the edge between CGI and live action. It lends a slightly unreal, computer game look to the wider battle scenes (such as the amphibious landings which involved a huge number of ships).

The acting is also exemplary. With such a large cast and enormous stage it is difficult to keep track of the characters (at least to begin with) and indeed to recognise them at all in the heat of the battle scenes but the individuals nevertheless come across well and there are some deeply moving performances. One word of criticism is that little attention is paid to the Japanese protagonists. It would clearly be hard to cover all bases equally but for the most part the ""Japs"" are no more than extras to be mown down in enormous swathes. This is of course a reasonably accurate reflection of their role (at least to western eyes) during the war itself but perhaps enough time has passed that a more intimate and sympathetic view would be warranted (see, for instance,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Letters-from-Iwo-Jima/dp/B000Q6ZM2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Letters from Iwo Jima</a>).

One other minor complaint is that the storyline is interrupted by an entire episode set during R&R in Australia and focusing largely on the characters' amorous relationships with the locals. Obviously this happened in real life and it is of some historical interest but it fractures the flow somewhat. It is tolerable, but a little irritating.

In summary this is a sumptuous war drama that will sit proudly, alongside BoB or by itself, as a fitting tribute to the achievements of a dying breed. It is only a shame that we in the UK cannot provide a similar tribute to our own grandfathers.",1326326400,,4422,5.858695652173913

I could never really articulate specifically why though. But, after reading other reviews I found many criticisms I agree with. I found the sporadicness of the settings, protagonists, and timeline to be a major detraction. I also had trouble relating to and caring about the characters. Devoting entire episodes to the love interests of Leckie and Basilone subtracted from the message and historical value of the series. If you're trying to fit the entire pacific theatre into ten episodes then they really could have made better use of the time. (Next time I watch it I'll probably skip the entire australia episode.) I've seen the series 2 and a half times now and I still can't remember more than 3 or 4 characters names, the scope of characters is so broad and they try to develop them, but fall short on time to do it and squander the time they do have. I also missed having the narrations that were peppered throughout band of brothers. They provided insight, perspective and intimacy with the characters that was lacking in the pacific. At the end of the day though, it was still a brilliant work of art that I will watch again and again and recommend it to anyone who's never seen it. It was just a bit of a let down after band of brothers. My expectations were high and I was expecting something as good or better. Finally, I'd like to note that the sex, violence and profanity in the series did NOT bother me at all and I was shocked to hear others complain about it their reviews.

The third episode, set during a moment of respite in Australia, remedies this and from this point I found the series increasingly gripping.

The fragmented, and sometimes pointless, nature of the Pacific campaign means that this series is perhaps even more character driven than ""Band of Brothers"" with its Normandy to Germany narrative arc. In some ways this makes it easier to relate to as it focuses principally on just three marines: Leckie, Basilone and Sledge. On the other hand the brutality of the Pacific fighting, the underlying racism of the conflict and the marines culture of taking no prisoners leavens our thinking about these people and poses back to the viewer the uncomfortable question of how we would behave if we had to courage to face similar circumstances.

Consequently the series avoids jingoism and mock heroism. The combat sequences are terrifying rather than exciting and the overall tone is sorrowful rather than celebratory. It raises difficult issues and does not provide comforting answers.",1325203200,2,1252,5.16256157635468

1167047,3,6305837325,"After watching Band of Brothers a historic story of the European Campaign of Army's Easy Company I was more than excited when I heard there would be a series following the Marine Corps Island Hopping Campaign. Having served in the Marine Corps Infantry myself from 91'-98' we studied and heard the wars stories of ""Chesty Puller"" and the battles in Guadalcanal 1/1, Pelilu (sp). The series just doesn't do a great job of capturing the war at all. It jumps around quite a bit and spends too much in my opinion outside of the combat theater. I was disappointed it just followed the lives of just 3 Marines. I wanted a series I could watch over and over like I do with band of brothers. This was a one time series for me. I guess it was just too hard to follow in the ""combat"" boots of the first series.

I thought the music and cinematography were excellent. The story lines were very disjointed - it jumps around a lot - not difficult to follow, but it just doesn't flow very well.

My biggest complaint is that several of the episodes were basically pornography - very graphic sex scenes that I felt added nothing to the story - only cheapend it. The only thing missing was the closeup ""penetration"" scenes. Shame on you Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks for cheapening the story with this SMUT. One of my sons is a big WWII history buff - we watched Band of Brothers together (there is only one graphic sex scene in the episode ""Why We Fight"") and thought overall, it was a very solid depiction of the battles of WWII and the comradery of the soldiers. I had to remove him from the room after the second episode of The Pacific - he just doesn't need to be exposed to that garbage.",1323734400,4,1118,4.396135265700483

1167050,5,6305837325,"I saw this on HBO last year and loved it.  Not having seen Band of Brothers, I can't make any comparison.  I just ordered BOB, but haven't received it yet.

After watching this for the first time, I thought it was the best and most realistic view of WWII compared to anything I had seen before.  I felt like I was right there among the action seeing the war from a different perspective.  Most WWII films I had seen glamorized the war far too much and left out a great deal compared to this production.  The fighting scenes are excellent.  Those looking for the glamour of war should probably look elsewhere.  I was suprised that the packaging was in a metal container as I heard Band of Brothers is.  It's well worth the price.

I had no problems with any of the discs and the bonus content was great since I didn't see this during it's run on HBO.  In my opinion, any mini-series Tom Hanks has been involved with is worth watching.  I also liked his John Adams series.  For me, these historical mini-series give me a view on life I've never seen.

I hope they do one on the Vietnam War since I believe its veterans have not been given the honor they've deserved all these years.  At least many of them are still alive and could give us some great commentary.

I'm looking forward to seeing Band of Brothers to see why some people love it more and hate The Pacific.  From what I understand from a Tom Hanks interview on The Pacific DVD set, Band of Brothers did not detail the characters lives after the war like The Pacific did.  The Tom Hanks interview said many Vietnam vets felt excluded and not represented in Band of Brothers which is why The Pacific was created to show the other side of the war.

i couldn't even get into the action scenes, which were more confusing than anything. this was not a live shoot. sure, battle is confusing. but the director's job is to portray the sense of confusion through the actors and skillful filming. not to just confuse the hell out of the viewer.

I hope the series gets better as it goes along, but so far, this effort has only served to show how excellent the ""Band of Brothers"" production was.

The series followed several of the characters home at the end of the war.

This miniseries sucks the viewer into it so completely that one can feel the hopes and the hopelessness which its characters go through. It is a war movie which does not preach nor does it lecture. It is not a larger than life ""usual"" Hollywood take on the Marines killing tha bad guys. In fact, one is forced to introspect throughout the goings on and even after it about the necessity and futility of war. How the soldier who wins it for his country does not win anything in the end and how the one's who are fortunate to stay alive are hardly alive. The war scenes are mercilessly honest the misery very real. The way many characters go a full circle, where they hate, respect and feel compassion for their enemy is so natural and human. One can imagine what moral conflicts and trauma soldiers go through when they are exposed to brutal battles for years. It is not about jingoistic patriotism nor is it a commentary on wars being bad.

1167219,2,6305837325,"When I heard last year that Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks had produced a new series, ""The Pacific"" covering the war, but with Marines, I couldn't wait for it to finally be released on DVD last year. I received the entire series of ""The Pacific"" one at a time on DVD from NetFlix, and watched it once.

I served six years in the Marine Corps, with more than three years of that in the Pacific and Vietnam. My father, a Marine, was killed in combat on Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands in WWII and I grew up infused with pride and honor for him and the United States Marine Corps.

I purchased the ""Band of Brothers"" DVD set when it was first offered by Amazon and consider that set one of the best of the best. I have watched that entire series at least seven times and consider it one of the best buys that I have made on Amazon.

But, as other people have stated, on this site and others, ""The Pacific"" series falls far short on story development and getting you interested in the people involved in the story. While ""Band of Brothers"" had you involved with the individuals and caring what happened to them, ""The Pacific"" for me had too much CG graphics in lieu of a story, a very disjointed story line, and too much ""soap"" in the series that had little to do with the telling of the war in the Pacific.

Only three or four parts of this ""The Pacific"" ten part series held my attention and interest. Many of the disks I received were ""fast-forwarded"" through simply because, I felt, that the action and story on the disk were inaccurate, boring and dumb. I was not basing my opinion on the differences between ""The Pacific"" and ""Band of Brothers,"" which were many, but rather on what held my interest and attention.

If ""The Pacific"" series on DVD could be had for around $25.00, I might consider buying it because of the three or four good parts on the series. But for now my interest level at the moment isn't high enough to dig into my pocket.

***using my Amazon credit card, and the one time use promotion code, I did buy this set this afternoon for $25.16 delivered on DVD.",1315958400,11,2086,4.36340206185567
1167220,3,6305837325,The main reason why The Pacific isn't as good as Band of Brother is pretty simple. Band of Brothers is nearly twice as long as the Pacific. That extra time gives the ability to develop the characters more. While watching the Pacific you're almost begging them to give you more background on the key players. To watch the relationships develop between the men like you did in BoB. It's still a good mini series don't get me wrong but it just could've been so much better. The music score is amazing. I just got it for $38.99 on their Gold Box Deal of the Day. If it was any more I wouldn't have bought it.,1315958400,2,604,4.260869565217392

But, I did see Band of Brothers first, and I guess my expectations were high as a result.  Some of the action scenes were excellent but, I thought it was a little slow (sometimes for entire episodes.  I also thought that the timeline was a bit inconsistent in that some battles were over covered while others were merely glossed over.  I also though the love/drama/action ratio shifted more toward the love/drama than existed in the Band of Brothers, so perhaps thats why I thought it was a bit slower moving than it should be.

If you have NOT seen Band of Brothers, I highly recommend buying that series instead of this one.  Tom Hanks was co-producer in both series.  I almost feel guilty giving this a lower rating than perhaps it deserves if you were to compare it to most other series like this.  But, I think that many people that are likely to purchase this are doing so because they have seen Band of Brothers and they expect more of the same.",1315958400,6,1041,4.4136125654450264
1167222,5,6305837325,"After watching ""The Pacific"" on Netflix, I knew it would be a perfect gift for my USMC veteran brother's 74th Birthday. The problem? It was only five days to his birthday and he lived in another state. I went to Amazon to find the boxed DVD set. I chose ""Supercdjoint"" as the vendor, for price and customer ratings.
 I received it, checked it for damage, packaging, and to make sure it was as advertized. Everything was A-OK. I taped it back up, put on a new label, and mailed it. He received it on his B'day.
 This was my first time using Amazon.com and Supercdjoint. I was very satified with both.
 As for ""The Pacific"", it is an excellent biographic. Another great collaboration for Spielberg and Tom Hanks. I have read many books about The War and watched hundreds of documentaries, but I can't recall anything that made me feel so totally awed by what these brave men endured. This is a real story about real men. I really liked ""Band of Brothers"", but this is equally as good in a different way.

1167223,4,6305837325,"I ordered The Pacific after being blown away by Band of Brothers, and I was not disappointed. Based on several books by veterans of the Pacific war, this series takes a more personal look at the lives of several veterans, and three in particular. John Basilone was a true hero in every sense of the word. I already knew his story, but it didn't lessen the emotional impact of his death on Iwo Jim and its effect on his bride of seven months and his proud family. I liked Robert Leckie. He was a bit of a rebel, yet he was introspective and had a kind soul. The war nearly drove him crazy, yet he survived and went on to a productive civilian life. Eugene Sledge had trouble coping after the war, and it haunted him for years afterward.

If anything, the series left me thinking how horrible war was and about the mental damage it left on the veterans. My own father fought as a Marine in the Pacific and, like several of these veterans, never really talked about the war. When the 50th anniversary of the battle of Tinian was mentioned in the news, I asked my father if he was there. He said he was, then asked me why I was bringing up such horrible memories. I never asked him about the war again.",1315267200,2,1198,4.277533039647577

I didn't care for the relationships being built (or not built) between the characters.  I didn't even care for the characters.  I'm sure my love for Band of Brothers set my expectations pretty high for The Pacific but I didn't realize that I'd be so disappointed that I wouldn't bother watching any episodes after the fourth one.

By taking the approach of a miniseries the three independent main characters were given greater depth, as was the representation of war in the Pacific. This miniseries was comprehensive in terms of identifying different stages of combat experience in war, and honourably represents the immense sacrifice that was made by U.S. Marines in WWII. It should never be forgotten that so many Marines gave their lives to protect the freedoms that we all enjoy today. This miniseries is a much-deserved distinction to those who made the ultimate sacrifice, and those who survived intensely fought campaigns in the Pacific.

1167263,5,6305837325,"I have watched all but 4 episodes & the island fighting sequences are incredible - so far focused on Guadalcanal, Peleliu and Iwo Jima. The D-Day episode for Iwo Jima easily equals or surpasses the Normandy D-Day sequence in Private Ryan. It's an incredible work of art that puts you there & gives you that tunnel vision effect you feel under acute stress.

In fact watching the Guadalcanal night fight I was sitting in a totally darkened room & must have got disoriented because I actually felt, for brief seconds, that this was happening to me and the Japanese fire was heading at me. I also felt snatches of fear that I couldn't tell where they were or if they were flanking my position. So instead of just saying, ""That is well done,"" or ""What a heck of a fight,"" I was actually saying and feeling, ""This is real & I'm in it!"" Never had that feeling before watching a film - combat fear.

They based it on Leckie's A Helmet For My Pillow and Sledge's With The Old Breed and Tatum's Red Blood, Black Sand (all those people are central characters in the series).

I can't understand the negative reaction. I find it's better than Band Of Brothers - grittier, far more action, better cinematography, better CGG - but then I have always had a passion for the USMC island & jungle fighting. (To me it's like they fought a 4 year Vietnam). Maybe some didn't like the home front or ""in New Zealand or Australia"" sequences between the island fights but that's essentially what Uris did with Battle Cry & you can't just go from island fight to island fight. Those episodes are better than most anyways. I think, for whatever reason, some wanted an exact duplicate of BOB which I'm glad Hanks and Spielberg didn't do.

It would be incredible in Blu Ray. Ignore the nay sayers. This is a powerful and emotional saga of the fighting done by American soldiers in the south Pacific during world War 2. Do not make the mistake of passing it by.",1313020800,,1933,4.498575498575499

These men served at a time when there was less technology and communication and we did not have instantaneous visual perception.  It was war - a war that our country whole-heartedly supported and against an enemy that had struck us in a cowardly act.  The attrocities and fanatacism shown by the Japanese sometimes pale in comparison to the Nazis.  Having just read ""The Old Breed"" by E.B.

I watched in horror; my wife watched from behind a pillow.  It gives you bad dreams.  The epilogue offers brief biographies of the Marines followed.  I was so haunted that I bought their books - biographies written by survivors of that carnage, not historians.  Read them all back to back from the library, then bought my own copies to keep.

These Marines were mostly boys whose lives and bodies were torn apart by this insane mechanized war.  They weren't the Rambos or Seal Team Six, they were scrawny, milk-cheeked kids with guns and unfathomable guts.  Their stories remind us (those of us who care to listen) of the reality behind the slogans and euphemisms.

BOB seemed to be on a grander scale with a bigger cast & couldn't have been better. But I liked The Pacific by just a bit. It informed me to a greater extent. Since we are so Euro-centric the war in Europe has been covered much more extensively. The war of the elite paratroopers carries it. The Pacific has fewer main characters, just battle weary leathernecks & a Medal of Honor recipient. It follows them from just before Pearl Harbor to a difficult integration back into civilian life for one of them. The usual campaigns we have all heard of are covered: Iwo Jima, Okinawa & Guadalcanal (especially Guadalcanal). Other battle-grounds less known to history such as Cape Gloucester & Peleliu are also highlighted. Viewing via dvd is a good choice as you can view it at your own speed & have a copy easily accessible to make your own. The acting is uniformly excellent. The extended scenes away from the carnage,  on leave & at home are a welcome respite from the carnage & make it more than just another docu-drama. The Japanese were not the only enemy. There are effective scenes of unremitting jungle rain, the heat, disease & mud, mud, mud everywhere. all the while enduring deadly sniper fire. The set pieces are of course the all out butchery of  battles in which civilians were often caught between. Realistic? It sure seems so. Hanks & Spielberg did a good job without an day of military service between them. As it was then & every war since, civilians just don't get it. I guess the only ones who really know were those that lived it. You had to have been there. There's not many of them left.",1311552000,,1725,4.5792880258899675

By the end of that mini-series we knew who each guy was and we could feel their feelings and cared about their survival.  The Pacific doesn't drive that feeling.  We just see a bunch of guys who fight in WWII but the soldiers are just blanks and we are not allowed to feel a strong link to them.

I would wait until History starts running it around the clock to watch it again.  But this is a weak follow up to Band of Brothers.",1308614400,2,730,4.134751773049645

Company, 6th Marine Division, and was on Okinawa from 1 April 1945 until it was secured. The 1st Marine Division was on the 6th's immediate left flank at the blood bath on Sugar Loaf Hill (and the other two hills which created the ""killing zone"")which was handled as well as ""Hell on Earth"" can be handled. But the reality was total butchery. Finally, the Marines simply poured gasoline down the holes and caves, and used ""Willie Peter"" grenades to light them up. Then the bull dozers sealed up the caves, burying those suicidal Japs alive.
The Pacific was kind to the U.S. Army. They were supposed to cover the left flank of The 1st Marine Division, but fell behind, as usual. So two battaliones from the 2nd Marine Division had to be pulled out of reserve to do the job that the Army could not do. After all the Army had over 8 million men during WWII. The U.S.Marine Corps never exceeded 800,000 men, yet were able to defeated an entire empire on its own.
As an interesting side note,as the 6th Recon. Company closed in on the last holdout, the Marines over took the guards,but not before the Jap General committed ritual suicide. My father took the general's samurai sword, and one of the guard's rifles.
Years ago, the Jap family history is kept in the handle of the samurai. I imagine the Jap we got to translate it, contacted the family, and they wrote my father, requesting the samurai be returned. I would think the best answer lies in the fact that I have both of them; and hell could freeze over before they ever see that samurai sword. An old Marine saying:""Don't bring a sword to fight a Marine with a
BAR.""
I have read the book, and all of the books from which the facts were drawn. Every night, I read book after book on the Pacific War during WWII. I have watched ""The Pacific"" untold times, and I have cried each time. You see, my father died in 2003, and I continue to attempt to bring him back through books and movies.

1167397,5,6305837325,"OK I am posting this review as I feel some may miss out on an amazing story because they start watching with the wrong idea. My entire household has seen Band of Brothers multiple times and we LOVE the film. That being said, if you start watching The Pacific hoping for the same dynamic as Band of Brothers, you will be disappointed. We originally started watching it with that in our minds, and as a result, this film seemed to fall short...to the point we didn't even bother to finish it (I am ashamed to say)

So months later, we decided to give it another go only this time knowing it was VERY different from Band of Brothers and knowing these films are shot in two very different ways, in two very different tones. Now watching it for the second time, keeping in mind that it is its own film, I can honestly say it is not better nor is it worse then Band of Brothers. It stands on its own (and wonderfully so) as a monument to all who served in the Pacific. Honestly, I really love this movie just as much as Band of Brothers and feel awful I didn't give it a chance the first time around.

While Brotherhood is still a theme in this film, what shines through is the REAL emotional aspect of war. The journey from who you are to what war does to each individual and how it affects those it touches. While that was a theme in Band of Brothers, brotherhood was the more centralized theme. I think what I liked best about this series was seeing the inner conflict and how war changes a man. I appreciate that they even delved into the Post Traumatic Stress many suffered after coming home, something which Band of Brothers never really approached. It is the sheer honesty of how the mental anguish was approached that I think really made this shine. Those of you that are fans of Band of Brothers, give this movie a chance as I think you will be delightfully surprised, just don't go into watching it thinking this will be anything like Band of Brothers because everything about it is different from the way it's shot to the journey you take while watching it. It will take longer to attach to some of the people, will be a little harder to follow at the start, but by the end it truly left me in awe and even sparked a conversation with my 13 yr old son about how much has been sacrificed for the sake of all of our safety. (Sacrifices that are still done to this day and should be appreciated and cherished.)",1308096000,7,2412,4.31057268722467
1167398,3,6305837325,"Perhaps I was expecting too much because of the unforgettable power of HBO's earlier effort ""Band of Brothers."" That series was a cohesive, sensitive and gripping story of how war not only breaks the human heart, but also how it bonds together diverse personalities. Those two themes worked together.

I mention this because I found ""The Pacific"" to do too much of the former and not enough of the latter. It seems to be much too focused on how war destroys the soul. To be sure, that's an important theme and must be part of every war story. But in this case, episode after episode seems to come and go with little sense of hope or purpose. You see loss and despair, over and over, without sufficient reason to stay involved in the story.

The war in the Pacific was a very different experience from that in Europe. Autobiographical accounts from the men who served in that theater make it clear that this theater of war was filled with a greater sense of despair. There was no clear turn of events as were seen in North Africa, Italy, or the beaches of Normandy. There was only a long, gradual series of small victories that seemed to add up to an ending. But always looming in the distance was the horrible prospect of war on the Japanese homeland. In that respect, The Pacific presents an accurate portrayal of what seemed, many times, a hopeless cause. Yet it wasn't hopeless. The men savored every small victory and they bonded together through their experiences, just as they did in Europe. While The Pacific is every bit as rich a production and as well acted as Band of Brothers, it just left me feeling a little empty when it was all over.",1307923200,2,1649,4.530201342281879

After the whole series was watched, I definately googled to find out more about each man as the film painted them to fantastic soldiers. People want to compare this with Band of Brothers but I don't think you can. Band of Brothers was about the airborne division in Europe during world war II, this is about the war in Japan, and I was completely taken aback by this movie, because my ignorance made me always feel there was more of a war in Europe, and never realized what the soldiers in Japan were really going through as well. That being said, I wish the Pacific had more episodes to the series like Band of Brothers. Regardless, its an amazing serious. I also recommend Band of Brothers just as much.

1167442,5,6305837325,"The Pacific is an experience that you never want to personally take part of unless you love grime and blood and deliberately want to lose your humanity.  The War in the Pacific during War World Two had several unique circumstances that set it apart from the European Theater. Many viewers found these circumstances so disorienting that for a moment they thought they were watching a mini-series about Vietnam War and not World War Two.  These people then unjustly give ""The Pacific"" a bad review, citing excessive foul language (more then what was used in Band of Brothers) massive splatter movie gore, and several sex scenes. Some viewers seem to think that movie is insulting to the Marines of the 1st Division that did a lot of fighting, portraying them as dehumanized killing machines that executed prisoners and gunned down civilians.

The harsh reality of the situation and history is that ""Pacific"" did accurately portrayal the meat grinder that is Pacific Theater of Operations of World War Two.

A common Japanese Soldier of the Imperial Army is more sadistic then an elite Waffen SS storm trooper, combat wise. Imperial Army fanaticism could easily be compared to the fanatics of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, they literal compared American and British soldiers to demons, much like how Islamic fundies refere to America as ""The Great Satan"" and warn if they don't stop American troopers they will rape every woman and child, and majority of Japanese foot soldier bought it hook line and sinker, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of POWs. The common Japanese army soldier had even more distain and revulsion of us then we did of them.

Japanese Warrior culture also had a thing called gyokusai, literal meaning ""Glorious Death"", which lead to literally thousands of Japanese soldiers dying in World War I era charges into machine gun area fire. During the Battle of Saipan 22,000 civilians, not soldiers, civilians, committed suicide, and out of the 31,000 combatants that where there, only 900 surrendered.

The hideous amount of gore, not just blood but entrails, exposed rips, shredded arms, and even one hallowed out head that one leatherneck casually threw rocks into only adds to the nauseating verisimilitude of what our grandparents went through that tarnished the souls of otherwise good people. Profanity was ramped the ration of soldiers dropping f-bombs in the pacific to soldiers in the Atlantic is easily 5 to 1.

Marines are human, meaning they cuss, they bleed, and from time to time the even copulate. Two Marines where lucky enough to fine someone to love, and expressing that should not be condemned.",1306800000,,2636,5.018306636155606

If you're looking for a feel-good film, you're looking in the wrong place.
However, if you want a better understanding of what the young men (and women) in the military went through in WWII, this series is definitely a good place to start.

It was harshly graphic and certainly not what I would watch for simple entertainment, and realistic enough to help the viewer realize how grave the situations were that these soldiers were in.

I certainly recommend it, as long as you don't have a weak stomach or sensitive ears.

Through watching this series, I've gained so much respect and a better understanding of those in the military.

the battle scenes seem to be mainly at night. can only see flashes of light, but the sound track is good to great. in fist four hours there was more sex scenes and female relationship scenes than battle scenes. also in first four hours: one guy commits suicid, guy bare hand strangles someone, a LT steals one of his men's gun, hero visit nut house, about 40 minutes of female male relationship scenens. oh ya, there was a ""bootcamp"" scene of dudes learning to fire off morters (it lasted about 30 seconds).

i bought the blu-ray. extra historical info is cool. color is good, sound is good, but this movie is not worth 50 bucks. wait for it to come on histroy channel and tivo it. atleast maybe the x ratedness might be cleaned up a bit.

Well it's been about a year and half, finished about two more hours the Gaudalcanal was very intense fight scene.

I watched only the first Disc. Almost half of it takes place at night, the fighting, hand to hand combat, discussions, etc. YOU SEE NOTHING BUT REFLECTIONS.

1167489,4,6305837325,"First off, this is a very good MiniSeries, and if you can get a decent deal, it is worth owning.  Unfortunately, it cannot hold its own in comparison to its precursor, ""Band Of Brothers.""  It does excel in one category - the combat action scenes.  They are as good as, and in many cases better than, the best from ""BOB"" or ""Saving Private Ryan.""  They are worth it on their own. Those get 5 stars.  It also drives home just how miserable, in contrast to the ETO, the conditions were for the grunts in the PTO.  But the rest of the series gets 3 stars, if that.  First - the casting is average in the best of cases, and poor in many cases.  The most glaring example is the actor they chose to play one of the 3 main male leads - Joseph Mazzello, the kid from ""Jurassic Park"".  He still looks exactly the same, and he just can't carry this series.  Fortunately, he doesn't have much of a role for the first half of the series, but after that, he's the star.  Second - the script (the spoken dialogue) is weak.  Perhaps part of the reason is that ""BOB"" only needed to fill in dialogue details to put the late Stephen Ambrose's excellent ""Band Of Brothers"" book on film.  ""The Pacific"" was based on 3 books, written by 2 of the characters in the series.  So the writers had to put an entire story together.  But that's no excuse for the dialogue.  There are no strong camaraderies that you can really believe in, in this series.  And after you've watched the whole thing, I'll bet you can only recall the names of 4 main characters.  I had very high expectations.  It did not meet them all, but it is still a very good series.",1303948800,,1622,4.259016393442623

I learned a lot about the pacific theatre and have a new found appreciation for those soldiers. It's just a shame that the directors were unable to really get you invested in the men/characters. To be honest, I didn't even know the main characters' names until quite awhile into the series and even now I couldn't tell you anyone other than Leckey, Sledge, and Basilone. Honestly, Sledge was the only likable person in the series in my opinion. Joe Mazello was hands down the star of the series and should be proud of his portrayal of Sledge. I would have been happy if they would have just followed him throughout the entire series. I also appreciated the story continuing as Sledge returned home and struggled to adjust.  I actually think they could have put more of that in the story and taken out the other men they followed. It's definitely worth watching and you will enjoy it; however, it's not a purchase and not one I will watch over and over like BOB.",1303948800,2,1217,4.58256880733945

Owning Band of Brothers and having viewed this excellent series a number of times, I was looking for a similar experience in TP, and didn't think the fragments viewed on HBO came close in quality.

My opinion changed after reading E.B. Sledge's, With the Old Breed, and then viewing all of the episodes in sequence over a span of about 10 days. While the segments featuring Sledge were not 100% faithful to his book, they came closer to being accurate than all but a tiny handful of war movies. The movie's portrayals of the carnage at Peleliu and Okinawa resonate not just with Sledge's work, but with memoirs such as Manchester's Goodbye Darkness. Viewers who watch the whole series will see a much more complete view of its central figures than what is typical for a war movie. Some of this is the natural result of having 10 hours of programing to work with, but much of it is the result of what was filmed. This is particularly true of the final episode dealing with post-war transitions, where TP delivered a sense of what it was like for combat soldiers to return to civilian life...very touching to me.

Criticisms of the movie's feaquent focus on American cruelty and combat fatigue in Marines has some validity. If one is using Sledge's work as the key reference, then TP seemed to tip the balance in reporting a bit, avoiding some of the worst Japanese actions, while seeming to expand these a bit on the U.S. side. I also don't recall Sledge being as angst filled in his book as he was portrayed as being in the movie.

The Series is also absolutely fantastic (totally on par with Band of Brothers).

The stories are great and it is part of history that we do not hear a lot about.  everyone knows the battles of Europe during WWII but there was another war going on in the Pacific that was completely different.  If you are a Band of Brothers fan you will like it but you must remember that it is a completely different story altogether.

The battle in the Pacific was bad in all ways.  We were not use to the land and also we were not ready for an enemy that will never give up unless they were dead.  They Japanese are very loyal to country and fight with honor, their lives were not as important as the life of their country.  The Pacific shows what the US went through during the horrific war.

The series has great reenactments of major battles in the war.  you see the war in the eyes of 3 separate people fighting for the US marines.  Worth watching more than once.

1167527,1,6305837325,"Unlike the Band of Brothers series, this series paints a very negative picture of the war and our Marines that fought for us.  Virtually every episode focuses on a Marine doing some either stupid or dishonorable.",1303084800,3,212,4.888888888888889

1167578,5,6305837325,"This is a quote from Gunnery Sgt. John Basilone in Camp Pendleton, as he's training his recruits, in response to one of them saying ""I'm sick of this training.  I want to Slap a Jap!""  He's trying to prepare his naive boys for doing combat against the vicious, brutal, fanatical Japanese soldier of WW2.  He killed many Japanese soldiers on Guadacanal, which was a true fight to the death, but he certainly did NOT take their skill and fanaticism lightly.

The rest of his angry speech goes, ""He (the Japanese soldier) is a combat veteran, and an expert with his weapon. He can live off of maggoty rice and muddy water and endure misery YOU COULDN'T DREAM UP (in soldier's face) in your WORST NIGHTMARE! The Japanese soldier doesn't care if he gets hurt or killed, as long as he kills you. Now you can call them whatever you want but never, ever, fail to respect their desire to put you and your buddies into an early GRAVE!! IS THAT CLEAR?!""

So to me, this speech epitomizes The Pacific..... Gritty! TRUTHFUL! NON-PC!!! Brutally honest!  The Pacific follows 3 Marines from training, through Guadacanal, through Cape Gloucaster, Peliliu, Iwo Jima and Okinawa.  They were Eugene Sledge, Robert Leckie and John Basilone.  They all weren't together at the same time and they didn't fight in the same battles, but their lives cris-crossed over 4 years.  Sledge made it through 2 huge battles (Pelilu & Okinawa) without injury, but returned hardened, angry and horrified at the nastiness of war.  Basilone did amazing things on Guadacanal and Iwo Jima before he died.  And Leckie made it through Guadacanal and Cape Gloucester (being temporarily sidelined for mental fatigue), before being severely wounded on Peliliu.

If you're a fan of reality, if you think that war is too glorified in movies and want a more truthful presentation, if you want to get insight on why the Marines hated the Japanese and took virtually no prisoners, if you want to get some insight into the bitter feeling of the Pacific Campaign and the misery of jungle warfare, then watch this series.  I highly recommend it!  What the Marines did in Guadacanal was amazing and surely turned the tide of the Pacific War, along with Midway.  The series makes this point very clear that they were out-manned, had the Japanese air and ship forces lined up against them, and they still won.  It was truly remarkable that they could inflict huge losses on the Japanese, with their WWI legacy weapons (still using bolt-action rifles!  But also BARs,  and 30-cal machine guns).  What they did on the other islands was no less amazing, for their sacrifice and guts to accomplish a very, very dirty, sacrificial and brutal job.

I loved the interviews with the real soldiers as old men, reminiscing.  They were American teenagers, trained by the Marines, sent off to fight the veteran, brutal Japanese soldier, and they couldn't have done a better job.  But they became brutal & savage in doing so, in order to survive.  In the movie on several occasions they wonder out loud, why the Japanese, being hopeless outnumbered & wounded, wouldn't surrender.  By the end of the war they didn't wonder any more, they just understood it and knew that the Japanese would have to be all killed in order to win the confict.  It's an extremely sobering thought, and bears greatly upon the US decision to go to extreme tactics of firebombing cities and using the 2 atomic bombs.

Then the Marines somehow regained their humanity and returned to the US, and picked up their lives again as civilians.  ""The Pacific"" details this very well, and gives you an amazingly realistic feeling that you are there in 42-45, in the jungle, watching real Marines in war, and yet all the time realizing their humanity.  It also shows their relationships with the women of their lives.  It's heart-breaking that Basilone stopped fooling around, married, was very happy, but tragically re-enlisted.  His luck then ran out as he died and left his bride behind after less than 1 year of married life.  But his presence on Iwo Jima surely helped to win that bloody battle and save others' lives.  He gave the ultimate sacrifice.

It's thought-provoking to think that after the Japanese had the military brutality burned out of them by the war, suffering what must have been an unimaginably bitter defeat, with millions of them killed, that they are now among the most polite, peaceful and civilized people in the world.  This is another sobering paradox to contemplate.  I recommend that you watch the Pacific as you try to understand how normal people deal with the brutality of war.",1302739200,3,4608,4.819338422391858

1167607,5,6305837325,"Probably the last thing anyone needs is yet another review of ""The Pacific"", but I guess that I need to write it.  As you probably know, this 10-part HBO series, produced and narrated by Tom Hanks, follows a small handful of marines through WWII in the Pacific.  The series starts with action at Guadalcanal, continues through the Battle for Iwo Jima, and follows the surviving main characters home after the war.

War in the Pacific was a gritty, dirty, and forsaken affair.  Though US Army soldiers were certainly in the majority in that theater of operations, ""The Pacific"" follows the war through the eyes, ears, and lives of US Marines.

I very much enjoyed Hanks' earlier project,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Band-of-Brothers/dp/B00006CXSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Band of Brothers</a>, so I was anxious to take a look at ""The Pacific.""

""The Pacific"" struck me more as an overall experience than as a series of interlocking stories.  Sure there are different characters, and we see their strengths and weaknesses, but what I walked away with was an overall impression of the terrible conditions that our military personel had to live and fight in.  The fighting was desperate and the typical Japanese soldier early in the war was already a hardened veteran.  Out troops, on the other hand, were committed, but green.  Battle soon changed all of that.

You should be aware before you watch that there are MANY gritty battle scenes, including vivid depictions of the gore, terror, and death of battle.  This is not a series for the faint of heart.  This is not viewing for the entire family.  My 17-year old son and I watched a good portion of it together, and he handled it all right, but I will not let my 12-yr old daughter watch it!

Once again, I have to say that my overall experience with this series is that it provided me with a glimpse of what it must have been like to serve in the Marines in the Pacific during WWII.  My hat goes off and my respect and admiration goes out to all of our veterans, and to all of the men and women who continue to serve in the military to preserve our liberty.  Thank you!

Andy Haldane was cut from the same cloth as Dick Winters.  If he had lived to be a lifetime rallying point like Winters, the same kind of unified story could have been told about K/3/5.",1299974400,,498,4.511111111111111
1167676,1,6305837325,"It's hard to believe that this series was produced by the same people who made the splendid Band of Brothers. Where Band shows the Americans as heroes and liberators, Pacific portrays the U.S. Marines as victims and dupes.

Both programs led early on with a signature bit of heroism: the destruction of an artillery battery by a patrol led by Dick Winters and a night battle with some sort of vague heroics by John Basilone. While skillfully portraying the fog of war, Band of Brothers makes Winters' heroism very clear. It is never clear just what happens in Pacific. There is a night battle, tracers go flying back and forth and the next morning Basilone is declared a hero. This isn't a fluke. There is a deliberate attempt to downgrade the heroics of the the Americans. Of the three central characters in The Pacific, one is wounded, one is killed and one spends time in the looney bin.

War is hell, of course, but World War II was a necessary war. Why treat the  two theaters of war so differently?

The answer, I think, has to do with the psthology of modern culture. Until the early eighties, except for the reasonable debate over the use of nuclear weapons, the war in the Pacific. like the war against the Nazis, managed to avoid the general disenchantment with war, no matter how necessary and virtuous.

Then a few college professors who had spend far too long in the ivory tower and not enough time in the real world wrote books revealing their discovery that there was a racial element to the Pacific War and that the Americans treated the Japanese brutally (somehow the good professors missed the cause of that brutality, such minor items like the Rape of Nanking and the Bataan Death March).

There matters stood until 1999, when President Clinton awarded 22 Medals of Honor to the Japanese American 442nd Regiment to redress what he called the racism of the US military against the Japanese. The award of these medals was absurd. The 442nd won two legitmate Medals of Honor during the war, a great record for a regiment which fought on a secondary front against third rate troops, was in action for less than a year and did not face any of the desperate actions that make generals hand out high honors. By contrrast, the entire Marine Corps, almost 100 times larger than an army regiment, which was in action virtually every day of the war, and fought crack troops in opposed landings and furious counterattacks, won only 84 Medals of Honor. At least some of the Medals which Clinton handed out didn't even pretend that they were awarded for anything above and beyond the call of duty.

No matter. Clinton's point was to accuse the US military of racism against Japanese and he succeeded there.

In the last decade, this effort to denigrate the Pacific War spread into popular culture with Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Father and Letters from Iwo Jima. Flags turned the heroism of Iwo Jima on its head and focused on the efforts of financiers to take advantage of the heroism of the Marines to sell war bonds. It was heroism as a capitalist tool. By contrast, Letters showed the battle from the Japanese viewpoint: men dying to protect their wives and families, dying for duty and honor.

The Pacific extends this trend, including not just war as a way to sell bonds but showing the rest of the American effort as made up of victims.

The reason for this is that the Baby Boomers are quite proud of their anti-war efforts, beginning in Vietnam (at least so long as they were still subject to the draft) and so on up to the present day. But this has resulted in horrible genocide around the world. More people of color have died in acts of genocide - in China, in Vietnam, in Cambodia, in Iraq, in Rwanda, in Darfur and now in North Africa - than died in the Shoah. Since the Baby Boomers like to think of themselves as virtuous, they need to denigrate the efforts of their forefathers to fight dictators. Hence programs like The Pacific. If you keep telling yourself that only fools and victims try to stop tyranny, you might be able to convince yourself that, contrary to Edmund Burke, all that is necessary for the triumph of liberalism is for good men to do nothing. Bunk, of course, but comforting bunk.

But a curious side effect has occurred. You keep reading a lot of writers whose fathers or grandfathers won't talk to them about World War II. These writers conclude that these old heroes are too traumatized to talk about it. This is rubbish of course. If you are over fifty, you may have vivid memories of your pal's dads telling you about hand to hand combat with a Japanese soldier, about being a Jewish GI in a Nazi POW camp, about getting wounded, driving one of Patton's tanks, about Dunkirk and D-Day. And you get two old guys together and they immediately ask each other what they did in the war.

Best of all, those of us who have come back from Iraq or Afghanistan know how these wonderful old men want to swap war stories with you. Suddenly, they aren't 90 any more. They are young and vital and the barriers of race, age, religion or ethnicity all fall away.

So if you find these old vets clamming up, it has nothing to do with them and everything to do with you. They have found that you don't measure up and you don't deserve their memories. It means that they have determined that you have no sense of concepts like duty, honor, patriotism, standing up for the weak and willingness to fight evil no matter how strong. And if you wonder why these old heroes have determined that you're inadequate, The Pacific is as good an explanation as any.",1299715200,173,5585,4.567432567432568

1167683,4,6305837325,"Stephen Spielberg and Tom Hanks did a slam-bang of a job creating The Pacific.  It has no equal, except, perhaps Finding Private Ryan, and for their equally brilliant Band of Brothers.

Forget about John Wayne's war dramas, forget about M.A.S.H., nothing compares to these three magnificantly produced war films.  I remember being blown away by Twelve O'clock High but it was a remote battle. Remote in that the men who fought and died did so off camera. Not so in The Pacific.

Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima were both excellent but I would place The Pacific, Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan a notch above Eastwood's fantastic duet.

All of the above have meticulously recreated the dirty and bloody aspect of war. My closest (fortunately) encounter with war has been to hear my brother in law recount his experiences in the Phillipenes during WW II.  He was in a special 50 Cal machine gun unit that saw heavy action there.  After taping his account (for the Library of Congress) I sat back and counted my blessings I missed that carnage.

As I watched Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, and The Pacific, I again thanked God I was lucky enough to be born at a time that placed me between all wars.  The Pacific reiterates, time and again, what sacrifices our service men and women have made to give us the freedoms we enjoy today.

Most of the battle scenes shot during the day resemble a mob running blindly into gun fire. Watching this made me think that the Marines of WWII were the most poorly trained soldiers on the planet who could be psychologically broken en masse and were guilty of absolutely brutal mob behavior. This was basically a Hollywood Vietnam War interpretation of the WWII Pacific theater of WWII. It was a completely inaccurate portrayal of some of the finest soldiers in the world and not entertaining at all. There was little character development, weak story telling and continuous foul language. This series is an absolute waste of time and money. I am currently trying to figure out how to get rid of it.",1299024000,27,853,4.693333333333333
1167727,5,6305837325,"I found the series very interesting because my Dad was a Marine who served at both Peleliu and Okinawa.  Dad earned a SPOT Bronze Star with ""V"" Device (for valor) at Peleliu's Hill One and was field promoted for taking out an enemy 75mm fieldpiece, singlehandedly; with his bazooka, and he earned a Silver Star six weeks before he was KIA on the last day of the Okinawa campaign.

I always knew that Peleliu was a bloody battle, but there was little information at the time at the Marine Heritage Museum at Quantico (a must-see place) or the former museum in DC. For the first time in my experience, the series depicted how bloody it was by devoting three of the disks to it.  Peleliu had the highest attrition rate of any battle for the Marines in the Pacific Theater; it was also a battle that some thought not necessary, especially Admiral Halsey.  But Halsey was over-ruled by MacArthur and his cabal.

What was supposed to be a three-day cakewalk turned into an over 2-1/2 month bloodbath.  There were 6,542 Marine casualties in all out of about 10,000 who were sent there -- a 65 percent attrition rate.  After three days of Naval bombardment and the Navy's announcement that they had run out of targets, they sent in the Marines to be slaughtered by an entrenched, devious enemy.  The enemy opened fire from well-concealed and protected positions that the Naval bombardment did not even scratch.

I also was very impressed with the depiction of Lt. Andrew A. (Ack Ack) Haldane, the beloved leader of K/3/5's mortarmen.  My Dad was with HQ/1/5's Assault Platoon, which employed special weps and generally kicked a whole lot of ass - as did all the Marines of the time.

The depiction of ""Sledgehammer"", Eugene Sledge, was pretty spot-on from what is widely known about him.

Anyway, if anyone wants to see more about the Pacific Theater's history, I would highly recommend buying the series.  Plus, Amazon's price beats HBO's price by a mile.",1299024000,3,1948,4.727810650887574
1167728,1,6305837325,"The Pacific follows the stories of three Marines thru the Pacific Theater, as we go to Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Pelielu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa before returning home following the war. I eagerly expected Band of Brothers II since most of the production team from BOB was involved in this series. What we got was a ""Band of Brooders"" as our three heroes spend nearly every waking hour ""brooding"" over something; the horrors of war, women, petty disagreements, more horrors of war. Yes, this did often happen during lulls in fighting, but these guys ""brood"" 24/7 (a recipe for getting killed quickly in combat).
We don't identify with any of these 3 characters, and the rest of the marines sort of come and go like cheap soap opera extras. If we are to believe this mini-series, the Marines were a haunted, untrained gaggle who somehow whipped the Japanese while constantly engaging in war crimes. I had the sense many of the battle scenes were mapped out by an 8 year-old playing Army Men in the back yard. What a disappointment!

Positives:
The music is beautifully done, even better than BOB (which says alot).
Great attention to detail was placed on getting all the equipment correct.
The naval landing scenes were well-done.
The final episode was nicely done, in stark contrast to much of the rest of the series.

Negatives:
If you don't know your WW2 Pacific history, you won't have any idea what is going on as the war progresses. There are no epilogues, just a Pacific map now and then with Hanks giving a mediocre explanation of a particular island.
Episode 8, Okinawa, was someone's attempt to steal the crown for most persistent use of the ""F Bomb"" from the movie Scarface. I have yet to talk to a WW2 vet who remembers cursing on the scale of BOB, much less like this. So much for realism...
Training is shown as almost non-existent for the Marines, as is strategy, tactics, cohesion, morale, etc. They just muddle thru it (sort of like most of the writing, directing and acting).
Of course anything associated with HBO has to have gratuitous nudity, and this is no exception with (again) much more than BOB.

The look and feel of the piece is similar to BoB, except that this mini-series follows several different story lines of individuals, not a single company.  While this expands the scope of the story being told, it also has a tendency to allow the viewer to lose a little bit of intimacy with each individual.  With BoB, you got to live and breathe with the company, and understand who each of these men were, and completely invest in them as individuals.  With the Pacific, it is a little harder to completely buy in to each individual because the story moves between lines often.  But this is its only flaw.  It is brilliantly shot, compelling honest in its brutality, and provides tremendous perspective on what these heroes went through, and the sacrifices they all made for this country.",1298764800,,880,4.7947019867549665

1167735,4,6305837325,"This mini-series tells a war story - with the concentration on experiences of the people who did the fighting.  (Tom Hanks, who was a part of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and worked on ""Band of Brothers"" also worked on this mini-series.)

We follow the Marines as they ""are ordered to fight on dots of land that many people have never heard of before.""  Each battle has it's own horrors; weather is clearly a factor along with diseases, and snippets of scenes at home are also present.

It might be enjoyed more if you have a background on the people and places.
We barely meet the guys before they are dumped into the fighting (no training seen, as in ""Band of Brothers"");  the fighting in the Pacific tends to be ""put into the background"" compared to the European Theatre of Operations, especially Hitler's Nazi regime.  We rarely see anyone give a hint as to why they are fighting in a particular place (is that because no one who actually did the fighting knew??).
The results were quite evident, however: staggering fatalities on both sides and the mental struggles that these soldiers were stuck facing.  What truly amazes me is that many of the guys who could have gone home and stayed put chose to come back and fight next to their buddies ... even after all they had already endured.  Only by depending on one another did anyone stand even a chance of survival.

1167777,4,6305837325,"This was a gift from the same person who had given us ""Band of Brothers"" which we have watched many, many times. Having had the experience with that series we approached this one with a certain set of expectations.

First off ""The Pacific"" in Blu-ray is superior in both the video and audio to ""Band of Brothers,"" which we have on DVD; I have not seen the Blu-ray version which may balance things out in that department. One of the things we came to appreciate in the Brothers series was the opportunity to get better acquainted with the characters before the action starts. ""The Pacific"" pretty much hits the ground running and one has to scrap around a little more to try and develop a feeling for this set of characters; before the series is over feelings of sympathy and concern will likely have developed for some of them.

Having said that the Pacific series moves along at a fast pace and carries one on through the key battles that helped us win the war. One aspect of this movie that set it apart from Brothers was its focus on the horrors and brutality of war and its impact on the Marines who had to fight the Pacific war and the civilian population caught up in the struggle.

The mind-numbing stresses provoked by battle produced different results on the different Marines who were faced with the challenges of warfare; the civilians who were also victims of the war suffered unspeakable horrors as warfare waged around them. The common denominator of our shared humanity evoked mixed emotions of sympathy, horror, fear, and dread as the varied casualties of war emerged.

The atomic bomb is casually mentioned near the end of Disc 9 with a reference to one bomb that destroyed a city.

Also, unlike Brothers, the last disc focuses on the challenges and difficulties faced by veterans as they returned to civilian life after the war; some to sympathetic receptions and some to stony indifference and all levels in between. I suspect it is nearly impossible for those of us who never had to face that sort of challenge to imagine the difficulties in readjusting one's thinking to civilian life.

Having lived through the Second World War as a child I vividly remember the fear and loathing that was generated in the minds of Americans at the mention of the Germans and the Japs! The media supported the war effort and no punches were pulled when it came to describing the atrocities being committed by both the Germans and the Japs; fortunately the very worst parts either had not been revealed or were generally unknown.

From what I have read and seen it appears there was initially a certain glamour attributed to fighting as a soldier in WW I. Since WW II the glamour of warfare is absent, and in its place is the brutality and horror of combat. This series carries on that tradition with effective conviction. The series has a TV MA rating which means for Mature Audiences only, the same as an R rating for movies; this gives you a clue as to the levels of deadly combat depicted.

It is a memorable series, however.",1297900800,2,3033,4.635009310986964
1167778,4,6305837325,"My family really loved HBO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Band-of-Brothers/dp/B00006CXSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Band of Brothers</a>.  That series knocked my socks off.  I was hoping for the same experience with The Pacific.  If I hadn't ever seen Band of Brothers, I probably would have been completely wowed, but I just didn't get the same experience from this series.  I think part of it had to do with the difference in the campaign itself: the Band of Brothers series covered a very linear campaign from basic training, to staging, to invasion, then through the European continent to the conclusion in the east.  But the Pacific theater didn't lend itself to the same linear storyline.  Hopping from island to island posed a challenge, and I'm not certain that this story dealt with it very well.

That's OK though.  It was still an amazing series and stands up well on its own.

I do have a HUGE gripe though, and that's with the picture quality.  So many of the scenes were just so dark that you couldn't tell what was happening.  We thought that the problem might have been with our TV, so we paused our viewing for a couple of weeks while I tracked down any possible technical problems.  I bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Digital-Video-Essentials-HD-Basics/dp/B000V6LST0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Digital Video Essentials: HD Basics</a>&nbsp;calibration disc to see if that would help.  But it was hellishly frustrating and didn't give any results.  Then I replaced the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/main-lamp/dp/B003QABV4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">main lamp</a>&nbsp;in our DLP TV, which helped some, but I don't think that was really the problem.  I finally tried the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disney-WOW-World-of-Wonder/dp/B0045ASBLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disney WOW: World of Wonder</a>&nbsp;calibration system and am now 100% convinced that I have my TV picture completely dialed in.

So we resumed our viewing and now we can finally see most of what's happening in those darkest scenes, but they're still really doggone dark and hard to make out.  I've played those scenes on other TVs and at friends' houses and had the same issue.  So it's not my setup.  The scenes are just too dark.  Period.  And I swear I'm not a picky guy, but I don't need the pain of my wife harping ""huuuhney...we can't see the movie...the TV must be broken"".  It's NOT BROKEN!  It's the movie!!!

Anyway, the stories are really great.  Not as great as Band of Brothers, but that's a tough standard to meet and probably not fair.  You owe it to yourself and your family to know this part of our history.",1297900800,,2800,5.818181818181818

The story is horribly disjointed and jumps around too much to even bother caring about the cahracters, which is why i didn't give a rats *** about the last episode.  The success of Band of Brothers derived from the fact that they followed the 101st from the beginning to the end.  They didn't curve a new story line off to follow the injured troops in their jury back to America, or follow the story of Sobel.  If you were injured and left the story then you left the movie.  That was the way in real life too.  The guys didn't sit around wondering how ole Garnier was doing in the hospital, there was no time for that.

The Pacific jumps all over the place.  One scene you're in current America, the next you're in Australia, the next your on an Island fighting the Japs, and the next your in someones flashback to America again.  The whole thing will leave you, the viewer, less and less interested as each episode goes on.

And i'll agree, the constant focus on Americans plucking gold teeth out of the dead Japs gets to become redundant.  I could keep going, but it's already all been said by other great one star reviews.  Bottom line is, don't take a chance and buy this.  I almost bought it because of the cheap price just to have in my collection, but after reading some reviews and being reminded just how horrible this series was i will definitely pass.

I'm only through episode 4 and what I'm seeing instead is a dark and dreary depiction of this story showing slovenly looking Marines even when not in combat. Although Marines do use ""racy"" language I see no need to depict it so blatantly for the sake of realism. Also, in the episode about the Marines taking R&R in Australia after the Guadalcanal battle, the emphasis seems to be on sex showing one of the main characters being seduced by a girl in her own house no less the first day they meet; shortly after they are shown actually screwing together as if that's just a normal thing to show in such a video. The story is a little hard to follow as there's little supporting narrative. In particular the battles seem like just a confusing and chaotic set of scenes. Granted that's probably the way it was but it makes it difficult to figure out what's really going on. There's little indication of who's in charge and what the various commanders are trying to accomplish. I feel that this video, something like Band of Brothers but much worse, is simply a Hollywood version of the war emphasizing sex and violence for its own sensationalizing sake vs. what could have been an uplifting story about  this great accomplishment. Watching it leaves me depressed instead of being uplifted and proud of what the Marines did which I know is really the case! Again, Hollywood strikes again and makes a proud moment in our nation's history look like something we should be ashamed of.

I recommend both the Pacific and The Band of Brothers for your library. It is a justified acknowledgement of the sacrifice that these World War II Generation troops went through. Since their was a movie about the Navaho Code Talkers and the 322nd Black Fighter Group ( The Tuskegee Airmen.

1167814,5,6305837325,"Seems difficult to grasp before watching it, but The Pacific has all the action of the original Band of Brothers but, for me, reaches a deeper level of feeling and gruelling intensity throughout the course of the series. Two reasons for this are apparent (for me at least) - by focusing on the plight of just three main characters you form a closer relationship with the soldiers and their journey through the war as opposed to the larger ensemble cast of the ""original"" (that's not to say there isn't a focus on the soldiers' relationships with their comrades-in-arms), the other reason being the varied and almost 'light' chapters dotted throughout the series that, to begin with, are seemingly at odds with the constant warfare of BOB (nice acronym). The Pacific takes you to locales beyond the deadly islands where the war pans out, and this breathing room for the characters makes the claustrophobia of war that follows all the more shattering and inevitable.

If you liked Band of Brothers, you'll find this a worthy follow-up. If you didn't (or haven't given it a try yet), don't rule The Pacific out - an emotional and literal theatre of war.",1296691200,,1150,4.808080808080808

There is a lot of family dram in the series that makes it a little too much like a soap opera and that distracts from an otherwise fine performance by the cast.

1167829,5,6305837325,"Unfortunately, some comparisons between The Pacific and Band of Brothers have not been kind to the former series. The reason seems less about movie-making and more about the disturbing reality of war, which is so graphically captured in The Pacific.

Band of Brothers was based on the book by the late Stephen Ambrose, whose books on the American Army in World War II talked constantly about how the volunteer soldiers of America could defeat soldiers produced by fascist regimes and suggested that war--or the right type of war--can be an act in nobility. Indeed, the violence in BOB served to underscore the nobility and heroism of what happened in the European theater.

In the Pacific, the emphasis is not on nobility and moral superiority, and is much less an ode to the Greatest Generation and the Good War theme than was BOB. In the Pacific, the emphasis is on survival, unimaginable brutality and the depths to which men in war can reach. You come away from BOB feeling uplifted. You come away from The Pacific feeling numb.

Regarding the movie-making aspects of the series, I had no problems with the sex and language. If someone is not good enough to watch the sex scenes and hear the language, he probably is not old enough to watch the graphic violence. And if a few of the non-combat scenes were gratuitous, the scenes involving the Basilone and Lena relationship were great television.",1296604800,,1400,4.825

What a shallow, silly, stupid man Hanks appears to now be.  Oh, and it's completely historically inaccurate...such as the embelished version of Basilone's demise.

It is different than Band of Brothers in that it focuses on a few main characters who fought in different campaigns at different times. These men were, however, linked one to another by friendships during or before the war. So as one man's duty may end, another's begins or continues on, so there is always a familiar face to follow from one battle or episode to the next. I have watched the series twice now and saw much more in it the 2nd time around. Not only in the actual scenes themselves, but also in the feelings and emotions each character was displaying. I believe the actors did a wonderful job of honoring the men they were attempting to portray. I would recommend this series to anyone who wants to get a very personal view of what it was like for the 1st Division Marines in the Pacific theater.
This series made me want to read the books that it is based on, and I have read 3 of these personal memoirs to date. The books by Sledge, Phillips and Leicke are all excellent, and I am starting Burgin's now.",1296518400,,1132,4.31924882629108
1167833,5,6305837325,"Having read many reviews here and other places I think a common mistake is using Band of Brothers as the measuring stick for what the Pacific should be.  Many people went into The Pacific expecting it to be Band of Brothers in a different time zone.  If that is what you expect, you'll probably be disappointed.

The Pacific does not follow the same formula of following one group of soldiers through the war beginning to end.  Even if that is how the producers wanted to structure the 10 part series it would have been very difficult given the fighting in the Pacific went on for 3 and 1/2 years while (Northern) Europe was fought and won is less than 1 year.  Guys get killed and rotated back too quickly to expect a story to be told about just one group over 3 1/2 years in the Pacific and be able to get to know that group as intimately as we do in BoB.

Instead The Pacific follows the story of 3 Marines during the war.  Each of the men contrast one another and they all endure wide-ranging experiences over the course of the war giving the viewer an opportunity to become intimate with what they went through.  I found the journey fantastic.  The series brings out just how different the war was in the Pacific vs. Europe, from the weather to the Japanese soldier.

Because of just how different the war was in the Pacific vs. Europe, the series is perhaps not quite as entertaining in the traditional sense.  There is simply more misery displayed.  The nature of the war and the reality of trying to follow 3 individuals does also make one have less opportunity to get to know the peripheral characters and make the series more disjointed (i.e. they simply do not have enough time to cover everything).  Part of me wishes they could have extended the series a few episodes for this reason.

One additional point I must mention is the sexual content in the series.  I would have preferred it to be more toned down in series like this so it would be seen by a widest audience possible.  I fear the sexual content will prevent young people from seeing it - much more than its violent content - so I find it unfortunate.

Having said all that, The Pacific stands on its own as a great miniseries.  The production quality is high, there are some superb battle scenes and truly emotional moments.

I highly recommend The Pacific (as well as ""With the Old Breed"" - E.B. Sledge).

However, if you do not have familiarity with the WWII Pacific war, you will find this hard to follow. Band of Brother followed one unit for a shorter duration of the war. The Pacific has to cover a longer time frame with three different soldiers. A big piece of history to bite off. Band of Brothers also focused on the combat unit not the home front.

My father served in the PTO in the Army in New Guinea and the Philippines, so it was with rapt interest that I watched The Pacific.  As cold and forbidding Belgium was in the Band of Brothers, so too was Guadalcanal, Cape Gloucester and Pavuvu hot, rainy, miserable and hellish for the Marines who served in those places. The Pacific tells in graphic detail the remorseless brutality by which the Japanese soldier fought.  The Pacific tells a story of the Marine's bravery and valor that we as Americans must be aware.

It is a great example of the modern anti-war genre that probably started with PVT RYAN and THIN RED LINE, continuing on through the two excellent Clint Eastwood Iwo Jima films. This new breed of epic looks at war in a far more realistic fashion than the old Hollywood propaganda-filled comic book imitations that had John Wayne saving the day with some super-human act of valor, this mini series recreates moments of battlefield history with incredible detail.

A lot of strong performances and consistent leadership from a collection of directors makes this fall strongly in the winner's column. Big Spielberg/Hanks production values are everywhere. A wonderful extra is the enhanced viewing option, which replaces a conventional commentary. It has newsreels, interpretation by historians, and a ton of picture-in-picture interviews with the actual people who inspired the characters in the film.

1167862,5,6305837325,"No, it's not Band of Brothers.  I've read several reviews comparing and contrasting The Pacific with BOB.  Some critics/reviews say it's more reflective of the personal battles and issues with 3 primary characters and there's a lot of truth to that.  Does it deal more with the personal struggles than BOB did?  I don't think so.

I think The Pacific, as did Band of Brothers, serves to document the extraordinary actions and the harsh reality of WWII.  This series really brings home the stark differences of the war in the Pacific theater as opposed to Europe.  The combat scenes can sometimes seem unrealistically overwhelming and a few caused me to read up on some history.  At first I felt the series ""over did it"" in a few battle scenes but then I put myself in the place of those fighting in the battles and realized it HAD to have seemed even WORSE than depicted on the screen.

For someone who is anti-military I can see where they could pick out issue after issue in this series to support their views.  For someone who is looking for an all out war/action series I can see where they would be disappointed with the time spent depicting the atrocities and the emotional struggles.  But if you want to see a straight forward accounting of what these people were subjected to, struggled with and came away with, this series will make an impression on you.

I must stress to potential buyers/viewers of this series, like Band of Brothers and Generation Kill, this is intended to be more of an historical accounting of what happened rather than a story to entertain you.  BOB and the Pacific have episodes that are well crafted to allow the flow of actual events to work well together, and help you follow what is happening to and with the characters.  GK is more of a ""start to finish"" accounting that doesn't attempt to tie things together for the viewer - you figure it out as you go.

For those who are into history and the military, a ""must see"".  If you're not into the brutality and gore of war, don't bother.",1296086400,,2022,4.5595567867036015

There was way too much nudity, it was completely out of place for the movie and didn't add to the storyline it distracted from it and cheapened it. It's like they went into this one saying okay we are going to make the guys grittier and show the darker side.  That could have been achieved without the nudity and kept it classy and we would have enjoyed the love interest story lines more.
Even by the end there were less than 5 characters that either of us knew the name of. This is coming from die hard Band of Brothers fans. We bought that set and have watched it at least 4 times. We've lended it out to people saying you have to watch this. When you watch Band of Brothers, you feel the characters and you grow attached.  By the end of that one we were crying when it went through who the real people were. We never formed an emotional attachment to any of the characters of The Pacific except knowing there were real people who went through that. Leckie was the closest exception and the actor who played him was outstanding in the role.
There was some well-done action scenes, but they were very scattered between the heavy focus on the love interests in the movie.

1167914,5,6305837325,"It took some time for me to get as emotionally vested in ""The Pacific"", as opposed to ""Band of Brothers"". Like several have commented, the two series are very different in tone, character arc, story, etc. What I had to realize was that the Pacific War, which this series dramatizes in a very compelling and impactful way, was a very different conflict than the one in Europe.

The war in Europe was one of liberation to free millions of people from Nazi rule. Naturally, this lends itself to noble and heroic dramatizations of the conflict. In the Pacific, however, it was a brutal, no-holds-barred war for survival. Those who fought there weren't liberating anyone. Instead it was kill or be killed.

That's why ""The Pacific"" resonates much differently with me. These episodes are emotionally devastating, and serve as harsh reminders of what the war was really about. The main characters descend deeper into darkness as the war grows more brutal and costly. The landscape becomes more hellish, going from lush, forbidding jungle to barren wastelands. Morality gets carved away, layer by layer to the point even when the more idealistic seem to turn into killing machines.

It was very difficult to sit through this series. And this is just a dramatization, with us sa the viewers at a far, far distance from the time, place and visceral experiences of the war. At the end, I felt sad and exhausted, not very eager to see another film or show about the war any time soon.

1167979,4,6305837325,"It's ironic that the word for the planet's largest ocean means ""peaceful"" when the Pacific theatre of WW2 has become synonymous with probably the bloodiest and most ferocious warfare in human history.

Spielberg's 10-episode ""Pacific"" miniseries in homage to the servicemen who fought against the Japanese in that enormous theatre of war is inevitably compared to its sister-series, the seminal ""Band of Brothers"" - a serious contender for the best-ever TV drama of any genre. ""Pacific"" has proved to be more controversial than the almost universally praised BoB for a number of reasons. Here's my take on it.

Inspired by Stephen Ambrose's book and with the majority of survivors staying in contact as a cohesive group of veterans who had shared the same experiences in the same unit at the same places and times, BoB was an exceptional opportunity to follow the continuous month-by-month narrative of Easy Company's time in the European theatre. These factors worked in its favor to allow for the realization of a novelistic story developed over 10 hours of TV, diverting only to focus on this or that individual week by week as Easy's campaign took them across Europe in 1944-45. We got to know these men, to care about them and understand them.

In contrast, the source material of ""Pacific"" comes from the stories of three separate individuals: Medal-of-Honor winner and national hero John Basilone killed at Iwo Jima, and survivors Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie who both later (much later) wrote best-selling memoirs about their WW2 experiences in the 1st Marine Division. This more ambitious concept makes for a somewhat fractured narrative, especially after episode 3 set in Australia when the stories of Leckie and Basilone diverge. On first viewing the series, it's not easy for the viewer to stay with who everyone is, especially some of the secondary characters, or to care about them. This definitely improves if you view the series a second time but it must be said that the overall concept, direction and editing might have made a slightly better job of this.

Another issue is the extreme contrast between episodes focusing on the uncompromisingly violent and horror-filled combat-zones and those which take place in the USA (mainly focusing on Basilone's time there as a medal-winning national hero being used to sell war bonds, falling in love and getting married etc.), Melbourne (the whole of episode 3) and the Pacific R&R base at Pavavu, including Leckie's time in the hospital. I think in truth this works quite well: this is how the Pacific War was conducted and the format illustrates how extreme was the experience these guys went through whilst fighting the island campaign and how it affected them psychologically. We're shown vividly that compared to the taken-for-granted comforts of peacetime life, being in these island battles was like being on another planet, or entering the Gates of Hell, and it was impossible for anyone not there to even begin to understand what it was like. The contrast is extreme, and illustrated well.

A point of objection from some is the amount of profanity in the script. The language is realistic and how these guys in that situation talked: however, it might create some parental-child-viewing decision issues. The combat violence is as extreme as we've ever seen on film: heads blown off, limbs blown off, guts ripped out, Japanese soldiers burned alive. The marines, and the audience, get used to this level of carnage very quickly. As Spielberg says of this series:

""It's brutal, and it's honest, and it's right there in your face - as it was for them.""

Heated debate has been generated here on amazon and elsewhere over the graphic depiction of ""atrocities"" committed by marines in combat situations. Some viewers find this actually offensive, and it puts them off the series. Well, gold teeth WERE removed from the mouths of dead (and not always dead) Japanese soldiers with bayonets and collected by marines: this is attested by Sledge in his memoir, and by other veterans. The reasons why marines eventually behaved this way was because they were forced to witness persistent Japanese Army atrocities on civilians and captured prisoners, and this was not (in my opinion) explored as fully as it might have been. Japanese soldiers would never surrender, or hardly ever. They fought to the death. The Bushido code created a ruthless, murderous, cruel and fanatical enemy who fought with a suicidal ferocity found in no other army in WW2, and to prevail against an enemy like this US servicemen simply were forced to adapt and do likewise. The process which led to this could have been explored with a bit more illustrative detail.

The acting is excellent throughout, often understated and subtle. All the three main leads are superb, especially James Badge Dale playing Robert Leckie with irony, intelligence and wit. Again this is more appreciated on second viewing. Even Rami Malek playing ""SNAFU"" Shelton who initially comes over as a kind of hard-as-nails psycho type mellows as we get to know him; his character works better on second viewing to reveal him as a bit more complex and nuanced, with a good and caring side, who has learned to cope effectively with the horror of his situation and the continuous loss of friends in his own eccentric way by building a hard shell around himself.

Is ""Pacific"" the equal of BoB? Wrong question. It's different. BoB has a kind of shining nobility personified by the integrity of Dick Winters, played to perfection by British actor Damian Lewis, which ran like a seam of gold through the series. At the conclusion set in late 1945 in Austria, with Lewis' voiceover relating how the survivors of Easy's campaign returned to civilian life, the audience feels genuine heart-affecting emotion. In contrast, by the conclusion of episode 9 (on Okinawa), ""Pacific"" leaves the audience with something of a downer, drained and dispirited with little to mitigate the relentless carnage, the filth, the dismembered and rotting bodies and marines gradually becoming psychologically more unhinged as their buddies are killed off one at a time. Were these sacrifices worthwhile? There's little indication that any of the surviving marines felt they were. The final episode 10, showing the guys returning home in 1946 and rebuilding their lives, is an excellent and valuable bookender to the story and goes some way to mitigate the gloom, but does not succeed completely in doing so. Don't miss it.

Worth seeing? You bet. Watch it twice; it's better the second time round when you have absorbed the mood and start to know the characters better. The extras on the Blu-Ray edition, including the ""enhanced viewing"" option (consider watching the whole series a second or third time with this facility engaged) are truly excellent. The bios on disc 6 are well worth seeing and bring the real people to life. The musical score is sombre, epic yet understated: near perfection.

I'd rate this series about four-and-a-half stars, which is pretty good. It has a lot going for it, but is unlikely to leave you filled with warmth and nobility as did BoB, feeling it was all worthwhile. However if you haven't seen ""Pacific"", I'd strongly recommend you do. If you tried to watch it already and abandoned viewing part-way through because of any or all of the reasons explored above, give it another try. This series is a notable achievement with its own special character, and it will likely endure the years well.",1295308800,,7510,5.009615384615385

The combat scenes however where excellently done and very realistic, minus the computer generated aircraft flying over. They looked like cartoon airplanes. I'm sure they could have rounded up enough Hellcats and Corsairs to make an attempt at reality in the air.

All in all it is worth watching but fails miserably in portraying the Pacific war as BoB did the European war. I think most of the cast would have been better suited in a film about the Vietnam War.

Is it because the Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg who swallowed Tom Brokaw's ""The Greatest Generation"" before 9/11, Afghanistan, and Iraq, suddenly remembered that they were bleeding heart liberals, and that the Japanese in World War II were just as wonderful people as US Marines?

It's noteworthy that the American soldiers in Europe didn't hate their German enemies nearly as much as the Marines and soldiers in the Pacific hated theirs, but you'd never know it from this series compared to Band of Brothers.  These Marines seem to have a deep sense of guilt and shame about killing their enemies that has seldom been reported in the histories or individual accounts.

1168021,4,6305837325,"As I settled into watching The Pacific, I immediately began trying to compare it to Band of Brothers. Ultimately, this method became unfair to the story being told in The Pacific.  While the film was produced largely by the same team that made Band of Brothers, they are two different stories told differently.  Unfortunately, because of the series' promotion, comparisons between the two series are inevitable.  One can't realistically promote a film based on its connections with another film and not expect comparisons.

This film contains three distinctly different stories about US Marines fighting in the Pacific against the Japanese.  These three stories never merge or diverge, they are told separately, focusing on the exploits of three primary characters; Eugene Sledge, John Basilone, and Robert Leckie.  The director chose to jump around and attempt to tell these stories chronologically and simultaneously. This method can be confusing, disjointing, and disruptive, and it was.  On the other hand, I thought they did a pretty good job of keeping it all together, except that Leckie is pretty much out of the story at the end of the 6th episode, though he comes back for about 15 minutes in the final episode.

As far as watching a war film about US Marines and WWII in the Pacific, this is probably the best film, overall, I've ever seen.  It has enough variety and action to satisfy most any war movie enthusiast.  It has plenty of Spielberg quality combat action, complete with flying body parts, exploding bodies, horrific imagery, cruelty, and fear.  It is a war story of epic proportion told on a grand scale.

I found the film lost tempo when it moved into scenes about the rear.  Covering the rear is all well and good, but I thought the producers spent far too much time in Australia chasing lasses and falling in love at Camp Pentleton than necessary.  Having said that, John Basilone's romance with Lena was probably an integral part to the story, whereas, Robert Leckie's love fling in Australia could have easily been ignored.  Leckie's brief romance just didn't factor into the over-all story, unless of course one wants to make a claim for some kind of esoteric message being extrapolated toward the final episode.

One of the strengths of The Pacific is in the supporting cast.  The actors, both lead and supporting did a fine job, but some of the supporting actors were exceptional.  One that comes to mind is Rami Malek who portrays Merriell ""Snafu"" Shelton, a Marine from New Orleans.  Shelton comes into Sledge's unit shortly after Sledge's arrival.  He is a gruesome character who digs gold teeth out of dead Japanese soldiers and behaves immorally in situations that call for candor and dignity.  Nonetheless, he bonds with Sledge, and they help each other get through the war.  Malek's portrayal of Shelton is on the edge and quite good.  We might see more from him in the future.

1168025,4,6305837325,"One of the biggest problems I had initially in enjoying this film was my impulse to constantly compare it to Band of Brothers which is a masterpiece. You can't do that and fully enjoy and understand this film. By the time I got to the end of the second disc I finally realized this and began to see The Pacific for itself alone. One other thing: the Pacific war was completely different than the European war in many respects. That takes some time to deal with, too.

 It is a very good film. Here's what I think is right about it: 1. The music is beautiful. 2. The cinematography is outstanding. 3. The battle scenes when compared to documentary footage is very realistic 4. The Basilone depiction is excellent 5. The homecoming sequences at the end of the film are extremely emotional.

Here's what I thought were its weaknesses: 1. the dialog and character development were somewhat disjointed. 2. The sex scenes were stupid and pure Hollywood garbage. 3. I know the Japanese soldiers liked night attacks, but a few more daytime battles would have been appreciated. 4. The acting could have been better. 5. Lastly, and most importantly, it did not have the writing and cohesion that Stephen Ambrose brought to B of B. But, overall, it was a very good movie.

1168027,5,6305837325,"I almost never write reviews on here, but after reading several negative reviews I felt like I needed to because many were looking at this series in the wrong way. As my title suggests, the biggest mistake a person can have going into this series is to compare this to Band of Brothers (BoB from here on out). I will get to the differences soon enough, but that mindset seems to have been in far too many people's heads and caused several to judge this series unfairly. I do want to make it clear though that I'm a huge fan of both the film and book version of BoB.

First off, I watched this on Blu-Ray and it's a great example of why the format is so impressive. The audio and visual quality presented on the set is top notch and will give any high-end system a good work out. This cinematography here is of excellent quality and a big reason to why it pops visually so often. It is practically required at this point for any war film to have excellent audio and a great score, and this series is no exception especially if listened to in DTS on a high-end system. Basically the transfer here is how the series was intended to be viewed and it does it justice.

The Pacific though is a great series with some flaws. The series focuses on three Marines' stories during their time in the Pacific theater of WWII. Problem here is that the three generally never fight together, nor are they for the most part in the same unit. This forces the series to jump between a few different groups and leads to characters not always being fully developed. The series tries to combat this problem by focusing generally only on one soldier and maybe cut to one of the other soldiers from time to time. I felt like this worked well, but not at first. In my opinion the first few parts were difficult to understand because many of the characters were two dimensional and forgettable, and by the time you get to know them the series moves onto the third soldier and most of the original characters aren't brought up again till the final part. If my review was based on the first four parts though, this series would be given about 3 and a half stars. Once Eugene Sledge is introduced though, the series begins to find it's own voice. Sledge's segments were some of the most memorable and emotionally wrenching interpretations of war I've ever seen on film. I'd strongly suggest that if you have mixed or even bad feelings of this series during the first four parts, at least watch to part 5 and I think you'll see the series begins to pick up more. I don't want to ruin anything though as the series does begin to make the audience care about these characters much better here on out and it is better to simply watch it all develop rather then read on it.

Now to deal with some of the criticisms. Like I said before, this isn't BoB, but unfortunately many people went into this series thinking otherwise. I noticed several negative reviews saying that this was a poor representation of the war in the Pacific and that several scenes were gratuitous. Many reviewers particularly cited the few sex scenes toward the beginning of the series and the amount of vulgar language used throughout. First off, this is a mature series and not intended for younger audiences. Secondly, I personally felt these scenes were not unnecessary and were helpful in developing the characters. Thirdly, find me a mature war movie without vulgar language and then you can maybe cite this as a reason. Even then I'd still argue it because these soldiers aren't saints and vulgar language is going to occur amongst a group of men, especially given the circumstances. BoB is often cited by these reviewers as a shining example of a series without these but apparently many reviewers forgot that these things occurred in that series too. It may not have been on the same level, but sex was discussed and presented in the film and it had it's own fair share of cursing throughout.

Lastly, several mention the historical inaccuracies and the differences between the novels the series is based on. This is easy to address. First off this is not a documentary, this was made for entertainment so some liberties are going to be taken if it helps tell a more complete story. Secondly, even if some events portrayed by the characters in the film didn't happen to the real people the series is based on, they likely happened to other marines and the series is simply trying to convey the emotion and events that occurred outside of the main characters.

To end this off, I felt that this series was great in it's own right. I believe many people went into this series with the wrong state of mind and many were disappointed in how it turned out. Unfortunately this caused many others to miss out on this series altogether because they were told it sucked. I'm here to say it didn't and that it stands right alongside BoB as a great interpretation of the second world war. If you have any interest in this series, give it a chance and watch the entire thing and I promise it'll be worth it in the end.",1294790400,,5052,4.510917030567685

1168107,3,6305837325,"Does a good job on covering the Books Helmet For My Pillow and With the Old Breed.  I recommend reading both before or after watching this series.  Great story about 3 Marines during World War Two.  One tells of the Medal of Honor recipient Gunny Basilone and his life, Leckies experience and finally Eugene Sledges experience during the war in the pacific.  Sledges was more detailed just like the book.  Great series and as good as Band of Brothers. This one was a bit more gory than Band of Brothers though I must say. Good acting, good stories on 3 different Marines.  Sledges part in the series is my favorite.  His outfit were in the thick of it all.  Nice to see a different theater of war and what the Marines had to go through in World War 2.  The beach scenes were good cause you see them leave the ships and then land on the beaches.  Not as gory as Saving Private Ryan but still good scenes.  I would like for Hollywood to start doing these types of mini series on The Forgotten War aka The Korean War.  Those veterans of the Korean War deserve their story to be told just like World War 2 and the Vietnam War has been told over and over.  Oh and make a mini-series on the First World War too for a change.  The public needs to know what happened there the first time as well.",1294531200,2,1288,4.246913580246914
1168108,5,6305837325,"I waited a long time to write this.  I wanted to watch it twice before I typed a word...and did.  Wanted to figure out where I was coming from before I started.  In the interests of fair disclosure, I should let you know that I have a special interest in the Pacific Theater of war.  My dad was a P-38 pilot in the 49th FG, Stepdad #1 was in the Navy, Stepdad #2 was in the army, and my uncle was in the marines....ALL in the Pacific.  I have also written a few articles on the Pacific, and have written for Lightning Strikes, the journal of the P-38 National Association.  I say this NOT to brag, but to admit I may be biased.

I think this is the most complete, the most real of ALL the great movies on WWII.  Pearl Harbor ranks at the bottom, its chick plot more of a distraction, and Barnett (sp) and Affleck were horrible caricatures of any of the WWII vets I knew/know.  So scratch that one.  The Thin Red Line was good, but way too much of a grad school phenomenon, with tricks and FX standing in for solid direction.  That leaves the Big Three of the modern era: Saving Private Ryan, Windtalkers, and Band of Brothers (BOB).  I have a difficult time ranking these against each other, one on one: a movie has 2.5 hours, maybe 3 tops.  A mini-series has more time to show us more, to explore in more depth.  SPR I put at the top of the movie efforts, mainly because it was the FIRST in groundbreaking efforts to ""get it right,"" and Hanks is great as always.  It didn't have time to introduce any women, and that was just fine.  There wasn't time.  But it beats out WT.  That leaves BOB and The Pacific (P).

I don't think one can really compare the two in terms of ""which one is better"" any more than one can say which WAR was ""better.""  I will say this to those who think BOB was better: I would bet some serious coin it's because the European War is easier to understand for us, it comes closer to what we envision as the ""noble war,"" we can get our mental and moral hands around it.  When the Lt. or Capt. tells the 101st to ""Take that bridge,"" ""Storm that position,"" ""Spike that gun,"" it's clear and easily definable...like the European war itself.  Ernie Pyle relates this story in his book ""Brave Men"" and it gets at the heart of what I'm meaning.  There was a U.S. hospital ship off the coast of Italy, taking casualties off and getting them healed and back out of the war.  Unlike the secrecy for the other ships and everything else in the Italian campaign, the ship broadcast its position every 15 minutes, painted HUGE crosses on its sides, and trained searchlights on those crosses at night....it WANTED the Germans to know where it was and what it was at all times.  It was stopped and questioned several times by surfaced German U-Boats, and German planes circled it, but did NOT fire.  The reason was simple: the German fighting machine--for all its admitted cruelties and tenacity--tried much of the time to at least pay solid lip service to the general articles of war and the just war tradition.  We could appeal to that.  We had NOTHING analogous to do that on the Japanese side.  Nothing.

This series also has no clearcut narrative like SPR or BOB.  And that's another reason I think that some people have a more difficult time with this series/movie.  Not only tactically, but strategically.  You're right there with the Marines..slogging it out on Pelilieu or Okinawa or Iwo Jima.  You're not privy to any grand strategy because the directors want you think see what the Marines saw, feel what they felt.  They had little grasp of grand strategy, and their world was one god-forsaken hell-hole at a time.  Period.  But that makes it tough for movie goers too.

The Pacific War degenerated into primitive barbarity and savagery.  And make no mistake: the right side won.  For anyone who questions if the atomic bombs were necessary, have them watch The Pacific.  Now to the meat of it all.

Brilliant performances by the actors.  Leckie and Sledge are the real deal.  You watch them degenerate into (almost) the same types of beasts they were fighting.  But that's real.  Deal with it.  I remember this story from my uncle (the marine): he was guarding some Jap prisoners and as they were marching by, my uncle noticed that one still had his sword.  My uncle said ""I want that, give it over.""  The officer started to protest.  My uncle leveled his rifle at him and said ""If you don't give me that sword in two seconds, I'll blow your ******* head off.""  He got the sword.  And he would have done it too.

And that brings me to this: this movie/series is great because it helps explain that generation who came back from the Pacific.  It was Vietnam on steroids before Vietnam.  This movie is the most violent movie I have ever seen, but all the scenes have a point, and it's driven home unmercifully: this is the cruelest war we have yet fought, and this was our enemy.  Of course there is some simplification: Leckie's parents and Sledge's mom are morons and the former especially are played like simpletons--they didn't ""get it"" about their sons.  I also wished we'd see a better and more complete picture of the air war (no P-38s?...there were some even in the early days after the Canal was won...read Leckie's other book), but this was a series about the ground war so I get it.

The music is moving, the ""home scenes"" are spot on, they do not distract.  Jon plays ""Manilla John"" great.  The sex is like the war--little time or desire for foreplay--quick and brutal (although there are really touching moments between the Basilones).  The fighting scenes are the best I've ever seen and capture the illusiveness and evil nature of the Japanese's warped and twisted version of Bushido: this is a violent, gritty, primal, slug in the face...which is EXACTLY what the Pacific war was.  I loved BOB and SPR, but for getting the total picture of the war, neither of them is up to P.  This series is the new gold standard.  Be careful who you watch it with and who you give it to (there are some horrendously violent scenes), but this is the way it was...or it least it's as close as we've come so far.  It probably hits the audience the same way Twelve O'Clock High hit the airmen back from the war only 6 years in 1951.  This is brutal.  But this is greatness.",1294531200,4,6288,4.457894736842105

I never had any idea of the conditions these men had to fight in.  They not only battled the Japanese but severe environmental conditions.  I didn't mind the romantic scenes as some people did.

It was so slow and boring I was hoping it would kick in at some point and when it never did it was a big let down!

With Band of Brothers I bought the DVD and have watched it over and over and over.

With The Pacific the thought of buying the DVD never entered my mind.  It was that bad",1294358400,4,448,3.6736842105263157
1168137,4,6305837325,"The series treats the Pacific war as primarily an act of sustained endurance, and less a recognition of comradeship and collective valour in a noble cause like Band of Brothers, to which comparisons are inevitable, if unfair. The two series are simply different in intent and execution, though The Pacific's ratings doubtless suffered owing to executive producer Tom Hanks's insulting moral relativism and imputations of mindless racism against Pacific veterans in pre-broadcast publicity.

The series is better than that, and should not be judged on the basis of Hanks's intellectual malapropisms alone. I had originally decided to pass on buying it because of Hanks's stupid statements, but since I received a $50 gift card at work as an attaboy, I eventually decided to use it to get the set.

The series production values are excellent, though the pace of combat is different depending on which campaign is being depicted; the Peleliu landing and advance across the airfield are particularly impressive, ditto the night battle on Guadalcanal where John Basilone (note mis-spelled name in the Amazon.ca product description) earned the Medal of Honor. The Okinawa battles are impactful in showing what was endured, physically and psychologically.

James Badge Dale (Leckie), John Seda (Basilone) and Joseph Mazello (Sledge) are all excellent, as is Annie Parisse playing Lena Basilone. Seda particularly projected more maturity/gravitas than his (obviously younger) character on the NBC series Homicide in the '90s.

The over-emphasis on race and the constant showcasing of language used to describe a frankly despicable enemy cost the series a star since they distort that dimension of the conflict, though such presentations are in keeping with the mainstream ""scholarly"" take on the war and United States culture at the time. The presentation of the brutalizing effects of constantly killing a vicious enemy that needs to be wiped out since he won't surrender is accurate (e.g., tooth collecting), but could be misconstrued by the unknowing as being due to ""racism"".

Overall, the series is worth buying and watching closely. It stands distinct from Band of Brothers, and is its equal.",1294358400,2,2190,5.354651162790698
1168138,5,6305837325,"How do you top Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan? You can't, but this is pretty darn good entertainment. It is also very accurate. If you've never seen a long laundry list of WW2 war films, this is going to impress you on several levels. If you have seen The Naked and the Dead, Guadalcanal Diary, Thin Red Line, Battle Cry you will recognize similar visual shots, battle scenes and experiences of the main characters. HBO/Hanks/Spielberg have not discovered new ground here, but certainly have presented it very well. You can learn a lot about life on the home front, what hero's did, said, felt lived and died.

The scenery is fantastic - a period piece showing the vintage cars, real tanks, half tracks. The human interest is compelling. Like its predecessors, it shows war as it is - degrading, dehumanizing, brutal and sometimes, absolutely necessary. This mini series cannot nor does it try to show you every event in the Pacific War, but snapshots of what being a Marine was like in some of the hardest fought and bloodiest battles in WW2. As Admiral Chester Nimitz said These were times when ""uncommon valor was a common virtue"".

The mark of good entertainment is that it leaves you wanting more. I certainly would watch more of The Pacific, as I would Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan. If Amazon had a 10 point rating scale the former would be 10's and the Pacific an 8.",1294272000,3,1394,4.6396761133603235
1168139,5,6305837325,"Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, along with a host of excellent directors and actors, have combined to make a mini-series that is sure to be regarded as one of the best-ever.  Similar to its predecessor ""Band of Brothers"", ""The Pacific"" takes a look at the war in the Pacific through the eyes of the Marines who fought there.

Three Marines are featured throughout the series: Eugene Sledge (Joseph Mazzello), Robert Leckie (James Badge Dale), and John Basilone (John Seda).  Through the different campaigns fought by these men, the viewer gets a true, authentic, and often horrifying idea of what the war in the Pacific was really like.  Sledge, plagued by a heart murmur, enlisted later than most of his friends, including his long-time buddy Sid Phillips, but he did see action on Pelelieu and Okinawa.  Somewhat introverted and hesitant at first, by the end of the Okinawa campaign, Sledge had turned into an effective killing machine, showing little compassion for the Japanese.  later in life, Sledge wrote ""With the Old Breed at Pelelieu and Okinawa"", largely regarded as one of the best narratives of the Pacific war ever written.

Robert Leckie signed up a few weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  An aspiring writer, Leckie served on Guadalcanal, Cape Glouster, and Pelelieu before being wounded. While on leave in Australia, he fell in love with a woman named Stella, only to be spurned later by her.  He wrote letters to his neighbor Vera most frequently, and he ended up marrying her.  He also wrote the excellent books ""Helmet for my Pillow"" and ""Strong Men Armed"".

John Basilone served as a machine gunner on Guadalcanal.  One night in October, 1942, Basilone single-handedly killed upwards of twenty Japanese while facing constant enemy fire.  He also risked his life by running to the rear for more ammo.  For his actions, John was awarded the Medal of Honor.  He was then sent home to participate in a war bond tour.  But, his heart was still with his fellow Marines.  He managed to persuade his superiors to allow him to go back into combat, and he participated in the Battle of Iwo Jima.

Quite simply, this is one of the absolute BEST series I've ever seen.  The acting is top-notch, the battle scenes were painstakingly re-created to provide the utmost in authenticity, and the ""extras"" disc provides information on how the series was made, along with mini-biographies of the major participants.  I've read many books about the war in the Pacific and I've seen many movies, too, but few of them compare to the job that this fine series does in describing the Pacific war.  Highly, highly recommended.",1294272000,2,2626,4.86936936936937

1168141,2,6305837325,"They had their chance to make a great series. They had all the tools for a great representation of the war in the Pacific and all the skills for great story-telling (as evidenced in Band of Brothers) but they blew it. Yes, we may romanticize war when it is truly hellish but some amazingly heroic deeds were done in those brutal times, deeds that remind us why we in retrospect refer to them as the greatest generation. I am disappointed. Band of Brothers was an honest but patriotic tribute. This is an apology. It does not do our grandfathers the justice they deserve.

If you love your country and have the courage to tell the tales of these men honestly (the good, the bad and the ugly) then you would have in your hands one of the greatest, most epic stories in our history. I urge you to see the series ""WWII in HD"". It accomplishes everything that The Pacific tried but failed to do.

1168142,5,6305837325,"As the son of a World War II Marine combat veteran of the Pacific, I'd have to completely disagree with those who complain about the ""inchoherent plot line, brutality and sex"" of the series. The story line is only incoherent if you don't pay attention--the Pacific war was a lot more complicated than in Europe and lasted a lot longer. The brutality of the series is spot on from Leckie's and Sledge's memoirs, not to mention William Manchester's and many others. More specifically to me, it correlates almost exactly to what my dad told me about his experiences, and I'm positive he didn't tell me the worst, but what he did tell me was horrific enough. As Bill Guarnere (from BOB fame) said to one of the producers, ""The Pacific, now that was really tough."" This from a guy who lost a leg in the war. As for the sex, I remember the sex scene in BOB quite well, so I'm not sure what the complaint really is. I understand many would appreciate a whitewash of just how inhuman the Pacific war was, and think every American soldier is a boy scout, but it is clear that they are not--especially when the horrors of combat strain their humanity to the breaking point. In some ways, that is what is best about the series--how it shows the slow (or fast) process of men breaking under the strain of combat. Sledge starts out so eager and gung ho, and comes back an inch from a broken man. Yet, somehow he was able to pull himself together and lead a worthwhile and productive life. My dad had nightmares for over a decade after the war, and I believe he had his last malaria attack in the late 1950s, but he too was a contributing member of society and a good citizen. I have watched the series with all my children, and am so thankful that my dad's war finally has started to get serious attention in popular culture.",1294185600,,1812,4.411940298507463

By the time we had seen the fourth episode, however, we were deeply disappointed.  I had read the reviews ahead of time and now find I am in agreement with most of the negative reviews that were in the two and one star category.

One cannot blame the actors; they did as well as they could with the scripts they were given.  In choosing them, however, casting picked actors that virtually look alike so that one cannot identify with anyone.  In Band of Brothers, the actors were distinctly different in temperament, appearance, accents, and one could immediately tell who you were following.  Here, that was impossible.  The script consisted of a series of poorly connected experiences punctuated with firefights.  There were no threads of continuity or sense of direction.  The music seemed like an attempt to re-create the same musical background as in Band of Brothers; the facial expressions of stress and shock, again as if imitating the other series.

1168223,5,6305837325,"For the past fifty years, the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II has never been given the ""definitive"" treatment. Now, there have been some very good movies made about the events of the Pacific War (""Letters from Iwo Jima"" and the underrated ""The Great Raid"" are two very fine films), but none (save for maybe ""The Great Raid"") have really captured the full brutality, realism and heroism that shaped the war in the Pacific. But all that finally changes with ""The Pacific,"" the ten-part miniseries from executive producers Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and Gary Goetzman, the men who brought us the award-winning ""Band of Brothers,"" the definitive look at combat in Europe.

Whereas the European and Pacific wars were vastly different entities unto themselves, the producers chose to take a different approach to ""The Pacific"" than was taken with ""Band of Brothers."" While the previous miniseries focused on the camaraderie that forms between men during war, this one focuses on the brutality of war, and how it affects the individual. It focuses on three Marines: Eugene Sledge, Robert Leckie and ""Manila John"" Basilone, and their actions in battles at places named Guadalcanal, New Britain, Peleliu, Iwo Jima and Okinawa, and how the war changed their lives forever.

Does the new miniseries achieve the same power and gravitas that its sister miniseries did? It does come very close. The only thing that keeps it from becoming a perfect companion to ""Band of Brothers"" is the first four episodes of the series. Although very good, there are a few minor problems with them. Unlike the previous miniseries, which gave us a chance to get to know the men before throwing them into battle, we are briefly introduced to the characters before quickly being thrown into the conflict. So there really isn't a lot of emotional connection with the characters at first. Also, episode three of the program, a look at the 1st Marine Division's time in Australia during R&R after Guadalcanal, provides the series' real weak point. Although a pretty good episode, was there really need for an entire hour devoted to the break between battles?

However, things take a turn for the excellent with episode five, the beginning of a three-episode arc about the Battle of Peleliu, a battle unfamiliar to those who have not read either Sledge's or Leckie's memoirs, or frequent the History Channel. It is hear that the show finally achieves the quality of ""Band of Brothers."" The battle scenes go from great to fantastic, bringing us into the hell of the battle, and the challenges those men faced.

Episode Eight of the series, one of the more mixed-reviewed episodes, is actually a well-written and performed episode that looks at the relationship between Basilone and Lena Riggi, the woman whom he marries before shipping out to Iwo Jima. While some people complained at the fact they focused on the love story, what sets this one apart from films such as ""Pearl Harbor"" or ""From Here to Eternity"" is that the love story isn't a flight of fancy; it actually happened. And as Tom Hanks said in an interview, ""it's damned good drama,"" and really helps us to feel an emotional connection with Basilone as he leaves the love of his life to return to the war effort, and his fate at the Battle of Iwo Jima.

The penultimate episode of the series, Episode Nine, looks at the battle of Okinawa, and proves to be the series' best. Of the twenty episodes made of ""Band of Brothers"" and ""The Pacific,"" this is by far the most harrowing, graphic, and emotionally-draining episode, throwing us into a hell we could scarcely imagine. The final episode of the series shows the men return home, and the challenges they faced while readjusting to civilian life after the horrors they faced on the islands of the Pacific, and provides a powerful sendoff to this incredible series.

As a whole, ""The Pacific"" is the definitive look at combat in the Pacific Theater of World War II. It shows the absolute horror that these men faced fighting an enemy that they didn't understand, on islands never heard of before. Most important of all, you get a real sense of the brutality of that war, and the sacrifices these men made upon the altar of freedom. ""The Pacific"" is a near-perfect companion piece to ""Band of Brothers,"" and one that will change the way one sees how that war was fought, and its impact on the participants!

1168225,5,6305837325,"The Pacific is as powerful as any feature big screen movie or novel. I think people will watch it 30 years from now like we do the classics like Gone With the Wind. It's like War and Peace.  My father in law was with the 1st Marine Division on Guadalcanal and some of the other hellholes. He barely missed Pelilu.  He met his wife (my mother in law) when they went to Australia for R&R (I'm sure they were more reserved than some of the characters in the show).  About 10 years ago we went with them to Guadalcanal and toured the battle fields - Henderson Field, the Ridge, Alligator Creek, the Tenaru, and aross Iron Bottom Sound to Tulagi.  We had good insect repellant, but the 'no see ems' still bit us.  Imagine what a nightmare it was for the Marines and soldiers with mosquitos and all kinds of other vermin biting them, and the constant heat, rain and mud.  My father in law hardly talked about the bad, and never bragged. He told me funny stories, like 'borrowing' supplies from the Army, and having a Marine in his platoon who was a chef in civilian life. They enjoyed cakes and pies for a few days, after months of eating nothing but rice with weevils.  He passed away two years ago, but I think he would have liked this show.  We could have fast forwarded through the sex scenes.  The really violent scenes might have bothered him though, like, as others have mentioned, the horrific battle scenes on Pelilu and Iwo Jima, and the scenes on Okinowa where the men are close to losing their minds. These men literally saved Western Civilization and Tom Hanks and Steven Speilberg have done them and the nation a great service with this tribute.",1294012800,,1653,4.465116279069767

1168275,5,6305837325,"Most of the more in-depth five star reviews have said all that I could ever say about this series.  This is a fantastic and harrowing film series, wonderfully written, acted and directed.  The main purpose of my review is to add some more incentive to a prospective buyer.

First and most importantly:  THIS IS NOT BAND OF BROTHERS!!!!!!!  Nor should it be compared in any way to that series.  This stands alone and is just as compelling and important.  Anyone expecting Band Of Brothers Part 2 is sorely mistaken and will realize it from the first episode.  This is about different men in different companies in a different part of the world fighting a different enemy.  Watch this with an open mind and it will be much more enjoyable.

Second:  Yeah, there's a lot of sex and violence.  Big deal, be prepared.  Is it ""necessary""?  I certainly think so.  Look, this series depicts an insanely fought theater of WWII.  Anyone with a modicum of knowledge of the Marine Corps. during the war should expect it.  The violence and gore enhances the story and the situations these men had to face.  If the filmmakers shied in any way from that, it would be a cop-out.  The sex scenes are tastefully executed and quite honestly, there are about 4 of them in the entire series, all totaling maybe 10 minutes of screen time.

Third:  Buy this!  If you have the slightest interest in this series, you will be doing yourself a big favor.  Also, if you own a Blu-Ray player, you MUST purchase this in hi-def.  It looks and sounds amazing.",1293753600,3,1526,4.587360594795539
1168276,3,6305837325,"There's nothing new I can say negatively about this movie that other reviewers have not already said in other 1, 2, or 3 star reviews.  In a nutshell I felt the series suffered from a lack of a cohesive story, strong character development, good dialog, and tension.  I also agree it went over the top on the sex scenes and the gore.  As a huge fan of the BoB series I was quite disappointed in The Pacific and doubt I will watch it again anytime soon.  I do rate it 3 stars though because of the good production quality, cinematography, and some parts of the series were redeeming, particularly episodes 9 & 10.",1293753600,2,611,4.380530973451328

The biggest issue I have is the unneeded sex scenes, I'm by no means a prude, but they seemed out of place and detracted from the war.  One whole episode was devoted to sex, AWAL and leave.  It is still better than most movies about the Pacific campaign and perhaps next to Flags and Letters, the best historical Hollywood piece to come out in the last 80 60 years.",1293753600,,506,4.527472527472527
1168278,2,6305837325,"While watching this series, I always had the nagging thought in my mind as to what point of view the producers were taking with this.  Where were they coming from?  The negative view taken of American Soldiers is overwhelming.  Someone not knowing much about WWII would come out of this with a very skewed view of what really happened. I am sure that there were many men that were cruel and did many despicable things. On the other hand, there were many more that did their duty as best as they possibly could given the whole horrendous situation of a war that had to be fought. I kept waiting for a ""why we fight"" episode as they did in Band of Brothers, and it never came.  Let's not forget that the nation of Japan was responsible for this.  The deaths of millions of Chinese and hundreds of thousands of citizens of other countries were the sole responsibility of the nation of Japan.  It bothers me tremendously that we seem more concerned about the hundreds of thousands killed by the atomic bombs being used to end the war than the ""millions"" that were killed by the Japanese using conventional means.

The series did not flow.  I found it extremely difficult to feel anything for Leckie as he was portrayed, which in my mind, was immature and a total pr@#k.  Unfortunately, his role in the series was prevalent.  I knew about John Basilone, and it was difficult for me to follow his story when I knew the eventual outcome.  I wish that we could have become more familiar with the thoughts of Eugine Sledge.  It seemed like the the whole series was more visual than substance.

It, in my mind, is a watch it once miniseries.  I received the DVDs as a present.  I doubt that I will watch them again.  I have watched Band of Brothers many times.  I would only recommend this series to true fans of Military movies, history, etc.",1293753600,47,1833,4.4894259818731115

Very little time spent developing characters so we get to know them and can recognize them under all the mud and blood later on.  Too much gore!  Maybe the PTO was just bloodier than the ETO but - way too much reality.  Maybe it's a guy thing.  It took a few episodes before we figured out how to get to the historical perspectives and interviews with actual survivors.  That does make it better to hear about the action in the words of those who were there.",1293753600,3,605,4.348214285714286
1168319,5,6305837325,"""The Pacific"" is one of Spielberg and Hank's best collaborations since it's sister show ""Band of Brothers"". While there is substantially more romance displayed in this series (made for HBO) the leading ladies don't disappoint. The acting is great and the scenes leave you on the edge of your seat. The depiction of war as ugly, and how it leaves good men disturbed for what they do amid their actions in battle, is well directed and produced. This is not a series for the weak hearted or those who shy from gore or death. ""The Pacific"" is set during WW II and takes the audience on a vivid and accurate tales told from the mouths of the G.I. and Marines whose assaults on several key Pacific Arena battles that took so many lives from those who fought and died. The historical accuracy is grandoise and the grueling and grim battle scenes are an in depth look at valor and the dark side of humanity and what we must acknowledge as our sacrifices for freedom from that era. I am hoping that Hanks and Spielberg will collaborate to produce further war documentaries of this sort for Korea and Vietnam as well. I especially appreciate the first hand stories and testimonies of the few surviving G.I.s that are interviewed for the actual stories told of such remarkable pride, passion, and pain.",1293667200,,1291,4.641921397379913

You couldn't grasp what was really happening to the characters in the movie. But as the series progressed the battle scenes began to be fought in daylight. The Pacific achieved a tremendous balance between the soldiers romantic love's and the grim aspects of fighting and death on the battlefield. Some battles were won and some were lost in both respects. This is a very powerful series. The ability to create a war on film and do it right is no easy task. How do I know they got it right? Because my husband is a Vietnam vet and it bothered him to watch some of the scenes. Not because the scenes were too bloody. It was because the realistic sights and sounds brought back too many bad memories. The loss of buddies that fought next to you and the fatigue of war in general. It's all there and more.

It is disjointed and incoherent with a paucity of character development.  One star is all this deserves.  After looking closely at the authors and directors of each episode, I noted that they are all different persons.  I suspect that the disjointed series is due to uncoordinated authorship put to film by different directors.  The outcome is mediocre at best (and not worth watching more than once).",1293494400,49,551,4.870967741935484
1168328,5,6305837325,"I'd been wanting to see this series since I'm too cheap to subscribe to HBO and I prefer to wait until these series come out on DVD so that I can have a group video session where we can watch as many episodes as possible and get the continuity that allows.  Although written-directed-produced by basically the same people as Band of Brothers, and about the same overall conflict, Pacific is unique on many levels largely because the Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO) was a completely different type of warfare.  I won't belabor my review with an explanation of this, but suffice it to say, it has a completely different ""feel"" than BofB; not any less of a production, maybe even better, but different mood all together.

One should be prepared for a different type of warfare being waged by a different enemy.  For a prelude, I would recommend reading ""Flyboys"" by James Bradley in order to have an understanding behind the type of warfare that was waged in the Pacific by Allied forces against the Empire of Japan.  Much has been written about this conflict, but little has addressed the causes of the war and why the war was so brutal from the perspective of both sides.

That being said, ""Pacific"" is a great series to own because, at least for me, I missed a lot during the first viewing sort of like Band of Brothers, which I've viewed probably 40-50 times, and learn some new detail each time.  I found it hard to retain the names and significane of the people being portrayed after only one viewing and I remembered that only after watching BofB multiple times was I able to retain a comfort with who each person was and what they contributed to the conflict.

1168369,1,6305837325,Tom Hanks and HBO both boast that they're honoring our Pacific Theatre vets.  The film proves otherwise.  I've read both E.B. Sledge and Robert Leckie's books about the Marines in Pacific.  The books With the Old Breed and Strong Men Armed do not once go into the pornographic depictions delivered by Tom Hanks and HBO.  HBO totally missed the mark.  The film could have better honored the men by leaving out the raw sex scenes.  It could have also focused more on the goodness of the men inherent in this Greatest Generation instead of embellishing and exaggerating the minority few poor traits that may have existed.  This series will make you come away with less admiration for our vets than they deserve.  The licentiousness was completely inappropriate and took away from any good the film boasted that it delivered.  I recommend instead to read the books and stay away from this lackluster production.,1293494400,30,907,4.875816993464053

I am ex-military, so realism is paramount to me...and this series delivers it like no other.

However, the blue ray dvd did not contain the previews given on each episode of actual battlefield footage and comments by veterans who were there.  Since I had already seen the episodes on HBO I spent a lot of time explaining to my wife what had been presented on HBO when watching the blue ray dvd.
I would think anyone who had not seen the series on HBO would be inclined to give a lesser review to the blue ray edition.  Not to take away from what is presented here, this has got to be the best WWII series ever made.  I also have Band of Brothers and am in arguments which series is best.

1168373,4,6305837325,"The Pacific is definitely no Band of Brothers, but it is still a good series.  Cinematically, it is excellent but the numerous historical inaccuracies really bring it down.  After watching the series I read two of the books on which the series is based--With the Old Breed by Eugene Sledge and Helmet for My Pillow by Robert Leckie.  The series does not hold true to either of the books, and they really just seemed to pick out the parts that they liked to create their own story.  I understand that they have to change some things and shorten some stories for the sake of time, but some of the parts that they changed just seemed pointless to me, and some of the details they messed up were pretty important.  I honestly have no idea why they changed so much, maybe they thought the changes would make a better story?  Either way, I was really disappointed in the lack of accuracy especially coming from the guys who made Band of Brothers.  Had they kept the series accurate for the most part, it would get an easy five stars.  However, I think they still did a good job of portraying Marines in the Pacific Theatre and the battle scenes are excellent.",1293408000,,1153,4.483253588516747

As someone who is a fan of Band of Brothers and teaches a WWII high school course, I was looking forward to The Pacific for a long time and was not let down.  It is very different than Band of Brothers, to be sure, but I thought it did an excellent job of personalizing a part of WWII that many don't understand or place as second fiddle to the European theatre.  It is brutally haunting and depressing at times, but the series places the viewer right alongside the soldier and gives a glimpse into their lives and psyche.  Hopefully this series will go a long way toward recognizing what those who served in the Pacific gave to fight in WWII.",1293408000,,749,4.321428571428571

What those guys went through was pure hell. I do wish they would have spent more time on the battle scenes on Guadalcanal. They seemed to fly through that part. Their defeat there was one of the biggest turning points of the war for the Japanese, and lasted much longer than shown in the movie.

For the rest of the movie, I fast forwarded after 3/4 of the first DVD. Trying to watch those scenes that weren't actual fighting or showing something that caught my attention was brutal. To me they were mostly boring, with a few light comedic scenes thrown in.

2/10's of this show was AWESOME! with the fighting scenes.
2/10's of this show was alright with comic scenes and 1 or 2 of the telling points in the movie.

1168417,4,6305837325,"The Emmies gave this one Best Miniseries for its particular year.  First off, let's get the BAND OF BROTHER comparisons out of the way.  It's very different.  Less focus on heroics, no focus on one company, less time to focus on sub characters and there's nobody who owned like Spears.  In fact, this series focuses much more on the environment working against the marines (i.e. malaria, mud pits and other diseases) and especially on their mental breakdown as they witness atrocity after atrocity.  One of the arguments is that those fighting in Europe has it easier but that's up for debate, I suspect.  The miniseries follows three marines in different locations so at times the series lacks cohesion.  There's an extreme focus on the raw brutality of war as well as the overall bleakness experienced by its soldiers.  When you see Sledge trying to just get off the boat during his first island hit, well, you'll understand.  Nice touches on how most Americans didn't get what those veterans went through, especially in the last episode.  Surprisingly, my biggest letdown was that Leckie didn't get the girl I hoped he would get but I won't say anymore so as to avoid spoilers.

1168419,4,6305837325,"I have only the most basic cable TV, so didn't see this when it was first broadcast. My son bought me the DVD set for Christmas, and 2 days later, I've watched the whole thing.

Everyone involved has done a superb job. First-rate acting by both men and women, good writing, passionate directing, special effects whose realism is sometimes shocking, and always sobering, and live sets in Australia (close enough to the islands being fought over to have a real feel of authenticity) made for engaging story-telling with the feel of truth, and that's what a first-rate film production should do.

This series feels true to the experience of the Marines it portrays. I've read both Sledge and Leckie, and the series seems very much in line with their experiences, physically and emotionally.

World War II in the Pacific was truly a naval war (the Marines are part of the Navy), and I'm still waiting for a treatment of equal quality for the shipboard part of the conflict. My Dad was a Navy fighter pilot who flew 45 combat missions from the deck of the U.S.S. Lexington in the summer and fall of 1944, until the ship was disabled by a Kamikaze. He was awarded numerous decorations, including the Navy Cross, and his squadron performed admirably, but like the Marines in this HBO series, their exploits have largely faded into oblivion, as have the experiences of so many others who fought against Japan. The Pacific story has definitely gotten the short end of the stick in terms of popular knowledge and awareness, so perhaps this series, along with Clint Eastwood's excellent films of the Iwo Jima experience, will begin to redress that imbalance.

My only complaint is a quibbling technical one about aircraft configuration, but this isn't a series about the air war in the Pacific, so I'll let it slide.",1293321600,,1805,4.794212218649518
1168420,5,6305837325,"I'm currently watching ""The Pacific"" right now and it is completely off the hook! A few times, I laughed my ass off, especially the scene on Guadalcanal where the Marines pillage Army loot and then race away from the incoming MP's, then with the Marine officer telling the thief who stole the moccasins and the cigars, ""Don't let them catch you with those."" while the officer is currently holding a stolen crate of liquor! Then the scene where the gunnery sergeant on a firing range curses at a surprised officer who was waving his weapon around casually down the line and throws a few bullets in his face while doing so.

There are many complaints about this movie, about how ""it's hard to follow the battles"" and ""inaccurate maps."" Well, I found it easy to follow the battles because I WATCHED the battle scenes, and as an Army veteran, found it to be some pretty good scenes of when Sgt. John Basilone and his men mow down hundreds of Jap troops in their suicide charge. I like when Pvt. Sledge enters the movie for good, since I read his book, ""With the Old Breed"" and some of the battle scenes match his own experiences. Sledge is shown as a rookie in the Corps getting to get the feel of the campaigns that he participates in, and by the end of the war, he has made the rank of Corporal, and the survivor of two bloody campaigns. Sledge has passed away ten years ago, but I think he would've liked to see this movie, despite what the critics say. I even own ""Band of Brothers"" and when I ordered this movie, I thought, ""About time!"" It would be good to have a miniseries of what happened in the Pacific while at the same time the Airborne boys in France, Holland, and Belgium mow down Nazis.

If not, this HBO Mini-Series would be ranked higher.  The Pacific offers the perfect companion piece to the aforementioned 2001 production, with particular focus on the grittiness of the war in the Pacific theater, in contrast to its European counterpart.  The series pulls no punches, and exposes the rawness of war time combat atrocities, in spirit and emotion.  Humanity rears its ugliest side, with no prisoners taken.

It took me a measly 2 days of sporadic viewing to complete this entire series, and found it compelling enough to do so without being overwhelmed or saturated.

If you want to see the day in and day out drudgeries of a handful of WWII combat Marines, complete with an abundance of details of family and love-life, along with a few very well depicted battle scenes, this is a film for you. I was anticipating more of an island hopping, battle after battle account of what it took our amphibious Marines, fliers, and our Navy fleets to drive the Japanese back to their own waters, leading to the victorious battle for Iwo Jima and eventually Okinawa and culminating in the atomic bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Japan. I was also shocked to not see the immortal raising of the colors on Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima, the photograph of which was made famous by Joe Rosenthal, and of which a statue of the Marines raising that flag stands at the Mall in Washington D.C. and on various Marine Corps bases.  Perhaps, we'll need to research James Fahey's ""Pacific War Diary"" to write a film-script of the major battles and campaigns, although that is a seaman's account of the war from his ship's vantage point and doesn't reveal the struggles of Marines, in the air, on land, and sea.

1168574,1,6305837325,"Are you Kidding? This is it? The long-awaited series on the Pacific War that was supposed to be a bookend to ""A Band of Brothers""? It looks as though Mr. Murphy was right after all: ""If anything can go wrong, it will."" For just about everything that could went wrong with this series.

First of all ""The Pacific"" isn't a true historical series. More like a soap opera production with some interesting, and gratuitously gory, battle scenes thrown in. (You'd think every Marine was issued with a pair of pliers to extract the gold dental work of dead Japanese soldiers.) There's a definite anti-war spin to the series, and the suggestion that American soldiers were as brutal as those of the Japanese Imperial Army. There was, for example, a scene in which a Marine is using a dead Japanese soldier as a pin cushion with his bayonet, as if this was the moral equivalent to the Nanking atrocities.

(The Nanking massacre was was not an isolated incident. One statistic tells us all we need to know about Japanese savagery and the ""Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"": approximately 30 million Chinese (and Asian) civilians died as a result of Japan's 15-year campaign of rapine, pillage and murder in Manchuria and on the Chinese mainland.)

Unlike ""A Band of Brothers,"" the producers decided to make this series a statement about the personal lives of three soldiers, derived from their letters and diaries (like there's not enough third-rate melodrama already available on TV?). So, Guadalcanal is viewed from the perspective the ""Battle of Henderson Field"" and Chesty Puller rather than the ""Battle of Edson's Ridge,"" a patch of real estate defended by Colonel Edson and his Raider Battalion, considered by both American and Japanese strategists to have been the most decisive battle of the Guadalcanal campaign and possibly of the entire Pacific War.

Battles in which Marine battalions defeated regimental strength Japanese forces were typical of the Guadalcanal campaign, revealed in the final casualty toll of 5 to 1. This lopsided tally was due to superior fire power and tactics: Japanese mass banzai attacks, frontal assaults and infiltration with rifle companies, which were effective against the Chinese army, amounted to pure suicide against seasoned Marines with automatic weapons. But the true enemies of the Japanese Imperial Army were the malarial jungles of the Solomons and the deadly accuracy of the Dauntless SBD dive bombers that sank nine Japanese troop ships.

The inevitable comparison with BoB is not favorable to ""The Pacific."" BoB was a reasonably accurate dramatization of historical events. In contrast, ""The Pacific"" is dominated by a subtext: a surfeit of gore, an atmosphere of moral ambiguity and moral equivalence (e.g. repeated scenes of American brutality and the noble dedication of the Japanese soldier), a breathtaking indifference to historical fact and the strategic picture. There are, for example, the obligatory scenes displaying photos a dead Japanese soldier's family. (Yes, we know these obedient Japanese sons came from good families -- just like the Americans! -- the very families that raised them to murder hundreds of thousands of Chinese and Asian civilians in the name of their emperor, a war criminal with a hunger for conquest.) Indeed, the critics of this shoddy, lurid and sensationalized production, who say it is a insult to the military, are not far off the mark.

In short, ""The Pacific"" is another unsavory exhibit of America's unquenchable appetite for 'slob culture,' and viewers taken in by the sexual sleaze, gore, pseudo-realism, and melodrama of this amateur production need to take stock. That said, the battle scenes are riveting (if not entirely factual). Battlefield vrit, in which you can actually hear the sound of shrapnel hitting a soldier's canteen, is Spielberg's strength; coherent narrative and convincing dialog are not. The problem here is historical authenticity and a fundamental lack of seriousness. Victory in the Pacific was an amazing story of U.S. persistence, bravery and the military genius of men like Colonel Merritt Edson, General Alexander Vandegrift and Admiral Ernest King. Dumbing down the action to the personal level does a disservice not only to the men who fought these battles, but to the intelligence of American viewers. Alas! Who said Hollywood was dead?",1292630400,153,4363,5.190340909090909
1168575,5,6305837325,"This sums up the mindset of the men featured in this incredible series.  This movie is similar to Band of Brothers only in that it portrays a theater of combat in World War 2. It's different in every other way. It follows not one unit, but three men.  And not just in combat, but at home before the war, during the war, and after the war.  It's actually not really about the war at all as it is about Eugene Sledge, John Basilone and Bob Leckie, and the many men like them who served our nation during this awful yet pivotal time in our history.

It's foul, it's graphic, it's depressing - and yet it's also inspiring, encouraging and uplifting.  It's extremely well shot and acted and, while it does graphically portray the horror of war, it doesn't focus on that single aspect of gore and bloodshed.  We see the non-combat suffering of these men and learn of the toll it takes upon the human spirit both during and after the war.

I think that perhaps the most profound and moving part of the series was the commentary of the men portrayed in the film that is on the final DVD. This is where the above quote originated.  They were ordinary boys before the war. They were dutiful Americans to enlist. During the war, their only focus was to keep themselves and their buddies alive. And after the war, they sought only to honor the sacrifices made by their fallen friends and make the most of their lives.

This is NOT Band of Brothers. It's different. And in many ways it's better. And in every way it is highly, highly recommended.",1292544000,4,1533,4.427046263345196

I loved ""Band of Brothers"" and was very interested to see how ""The Pacific"" measured up.  The answer is that it measures up very well -- this is great entertainment and most viewers will not be disappointed.  This is not another ""Band of Brothers.""  It is very different.  Firstly, ""The Pacific"" in my opinion is more gruesomely realistic even than ""Band of Brothers.""  The battle scenes are fantastic and with Blu-Ray the realism is quite literally startling.  The entire production has a subtly authentic feel that is hard to describe.

The characterizations are a bit weaker than Band of Brothers, but not bad for all that.  The acting is all pretty good, and contributes to the authentic feel of the production.  One gets a strong feeling for how tough the conditions were for our Armed Forces, and particularly the Marines, during the Pacific War, facing an implacable and powerful Japanese foe, with both sides miserable and far from home.  One cannot watch this production without gaining an appreciation for the sacrifices that our soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen made for America in her hour of need.

The Blu-Ray quality is great, and looks fantastic on a big-screen TV.  I suppose it was too much to hope for that this one would be available in 3D.  Nonetheless, home theater enthusiasts will appreciate the uniform high quality of this production.

They truly only tell the story of a few characters from the book both are ""Grunts."" While important this production takes their stories and fictionalizes it for HBO's purposes. I mean it is a tradgedy and i can only imagine what Eugene and Robert would say about this misrepresentation of their stories of war.

Also the complete lacking stories of both the other main characters from the novel inscenes me that they would use the same title. To spare giving away their involvement and stories they are to say the least two insightful and interesting characters that give insight far surpassing that of the characters portrayed here. Also there are a few NCOs in the novel that do not play as major a role but provide insightful counterpoints to some of the negative views of the men protrayed in the series.

To only speak of the island campaign is not what the pacific(novel) was about. The pacific was a tremendous novel that was much MUCH more encompassing.

This miniseries should have been titled ""The Pacific: Light"" cuz it was light about five different stories and truly heavy on three. i suppose the individuals who wrote this were ""semper fi"" (as explained in the final chapter of the novel.

When first watching the show, I was astounded at the lack of humanity that was just brimming out of band of brothers. The characters are unlikable and generally forgettable. The story moves in a few notable tones. One is the Warriors in the muck. I'm sure the pacific was a hell on earth, but depicting hours of masochism isn't why I watch TV, and unfortunately this show was packed full of it. I was really hoping for a show more along the lines of the movies depicted from the period which is mostly of the sea and air battles. The show all but glances over them as well as pearl harbor or the ultimate capture of Japan.

The show stands as a story of the middle war waged from island to island between the US and Japanese forces, and if countless lopsided battles, trench-style warfare, over-baked emphasis on characters who aren't likeable and contrived dramatics are your thing, then jump in. Otherwise save the pennies and look for more Hollywood takes on the period instead (*shudder* never thought I'd ever way that).",1292371200,6,1382,4.706611570247934

1168582,1,6305837325,"I received the series as a Christmas gift from my son. Several years ago he had given me a similar gift of ""The Band of Brothers"" CD set. My hobby is reading World War II non-fiction and I have been at it for around 5 decades having been born during the same war.

I had previously read the senior and now deceased Steven Ambrose's account of ""...Brothers"". It was one of the best non-fiction books that I have ever read on any subject. When I saw, in the trailer of that video series, on the eve of D Day, airplanes with three white vertical stripes on the fusillage and wings, I knew it was going to be an authentic account of a great book. The markings were termed ""invasion stripes"" that were intended to help allied troops identify friendly aircraft. The series subsequently exceeded my expectations and I have watched it scores of times since and read all the other accounts of ""The Band of Brothers"" written by other members of Winters' Company.

I had read the individual biography of Medal of Honor winner John Basilone by James Brady. I also read the autobiography of Eugene Sludge. Brady questioned the historical accuracy of two previous biographies of Basilone, after his death in the war. One was written by his older sister and the other by his nephew. Brady felt that the books were based to a large extent on John's letters,their memories of him, and the extant public records. He felt that some of the blanks that existed were filled in by creative writing. Sludges account of his own actions were to the best of his own recollection as he stated.

I just finished watching the opening few minutes of the first CD and became immediately discouraged. There is a scene of a Lt. Colonel, (I think), making a presentation to a group of NCO's that in itself is extremely unlikely (where are the lieutenants, captains and majors?). He has a world map behind him that is clearly the product of this century's graphics. You may recall the Air Corp briefings in that time frame that employed strings and pins. The worst is that the map shows that Iceland has been invaded by the Nazis. As I recall, it was the US Navy and the Marines that staged a preemptive and friendly capture. They did not act on Hitler's behalf I do not think.

My most heartfelt thanks and love to my son Paul for the wonderful thought in buying the set in the first place. But....",1292371200,68,2363,4.526932084309133

1168642,4,6305837325,"The Pacific is a follow-up to the Band of Brothers which was about ""Easy Company 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR) of the 101st Airborne Division.  The Pacific principally followed three Marines of the 1st and 5th Marines in the Pacific Theatre through the war from the invasion of Guadacanal up to the ""bloody"" and vicious carnage of the battle for Okinawa.  The series showed some of the horrors of the war from the USMC perspective.  The series is a good example of why we need to honor these veterans and not forget those who perished fighting for their beliefs and countries no matter which side they were on.  This was an extremely crazy period of time where countries were bent upon destroying one another, the good part is this has been placed where it belongs, in the past and we can now live in peace again as allied nations once more (US and Japan).  This series was based on the stories of actual Marines, two of whom were buddies in school in Mobile, Alabama.  There was also a portion concerning GYSGT John Basilone, a Medal of Honor receipient at Guadacanal and later killed at Iwo Jima, he is still revered by Marines and many people in the US to this day. Also mentioned was the late and great LTGen Chesty Puller, an icon of what a Marine Officer is all about.  I felt this series was quite good but not as well done as ""The Band of Brothers.""  I would like to see in the future a couple of series done; one about the US Army Air Corps and their actions over fortress Europe and the other about the US Navy during the battles of the Pacific, their stories need to be told as well. I would strongly recommend this series for anyone who is interested in the War in the Pacific and the role of the USMC.  Be prepared for some very graphic carnage of war. I have always been interested in WW-II because my father an uncle and other cousins all served and these men served and fought in both theatres; one cousin was lost as a pilot on a bombing mission in 1943 MIA, he was very close to my dad and uncle and was an only child, a valedictroian of both his HS and college classes.

I attempted to watch this series for what it is without any bias, positive or negative, and my inspiration was a book I'm reading on the American-Japanese war (Nemesis by M.Hastings).

This series is an utter train-wreck on all dimensions: it has absolutely horrible acting (when it's not horrible it's simply sub par). The writing follows script with bland dialogues, disconnected and uninteresting side plots, and battle scenes that are at best generic and boring.
If you've read any quality history books about the American-Japanese war, you will be easily disappointed with how flatly the two adversaries are represented in the series. To be more precise, it's only the American side which is depicted at all (the Japanese are shown as zombie figures getting shot at in the dark mostly) and even then we are seeing unprocessed characters which cannot involve the viewer emotionally.

I can continue with the Pacific's deficits but I don't want to waste any more time with this disaster than I already have.
If you can keep your expectations extremely low and can be satisfied with precious little go on and give this a try.

1168649,4,6305837325,"The Pacific is another masterpiece from the team that created Band of Brothers.  It has the same format, length, and is even packaged the same.  But it doesn't feel the same.  Clearly, the intent was to let the differences between the two theaters of war speak for themselves, and they do.  If the war in Europe was intense and filthy, the war the marines fought on a series of little Pacific islands was even more so, but with less acclaim.  Even today, the war against Japan is more apt to evoke Pearl Harbor and the ensuing naval war than the grinding and miserable experiences of the marines.

BoB was based on an exceptional book of the same name by historian Stephen Ambrose.  He had painstakingly dug out the stories of a group of men who had trained and fought together, and wove them into a cohesive account of a single company of the 101st Airborne's experiences in the ETO.  The focus is on the group, and through the magic of film-making, the viewer comes to feel quite attached to the individual men in it.  And while it is not the focus of the story, the devotion of his men as earned by Capt. Winters emerges as an inspiring sub-text.  I have watched BoB several times and believe it is one of the most emotionally satisfying mini-series ever produced.

The Pacific is outstanding, too.  But it is largely based on the memoirs of two men, Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie, who did not serve together.  The focus is less on the group than on the common, brutal experience of those who fought in those island campaigns and, frankly, even by the end of the series I did not feel I really knew who the other marines were apart from Sledge and Leckie.  (There is a third, Medal of Honor-winner John Basilone, whose story is followed until his death on Iwo Jima.)

The result is a somewhat less cohesive series that, while serving as an honestly told piece of needed history and deserving of great praise, is harder to watch and somehow falls short in terms of dramatic arc.  Ironically, I suspect that the series would have been stronger if it had been based entirely on Sledge's account and the Leckie/Basilone stories had been jettisoned.  Nonetheless, despite these few reservations, the Pacific is a mini-series that can't be missed.",1292284800,4,2246,4.61712846347607

When I first heard about ""The Pacific,"" I couldn't wait to see it, but from the initial episode I was disappointed, and while it had its bright spots (excellent cinematography), there had obviously been some change in staff since ""Band of Brothers.""
On that issue, The Pacific book was actually written by Hugh Ambrose, the son of ""Band of Brothers"" author Stephen Ambrose, and the miniseries was spearheaded by Bruce McKenna, rather than Tom Hanks and Steven Speilberg.  This change in makers results in a lack of cohesion between the soldiers and an overall discombobulated storyline.  In ""Band of Brothers,"" fraternal and patriotic commitment drives the men through hard times and Nazis. The Pacific shows a pissy, dark, and shallow group that fails to draw empathy and interest.

In the first two parts it's one long nighttime chaotic battle followed by a bloody morning cleanup.  I counted four of these scenes.  Yes, this is war, and yes I should accept that and go with the flow and I mean no disrespect, but I'd like to be able to at least not be left hanging out there, disconnected from the action, and not having any emotional investment.

I can't count the number of times I actually yelled at the television, ""WHO are you?""

When the movie finally got around to showing us something of the character's angst, it was still handled in a disconnected way and the sex scenes really made no sense.

Our only complaint with the series is the map behind Chesty Puller in the first episode. It is very wrong.  It shows the Germans occupying Iceland (the British occupied it after the Danes surrendered in April, 1940 and later we took over the occupation from them).  It also shows the German lines in Russia as they were in the fall of 1942 not December of 1941. Thus the map shows the Germans at Stalingrad a year early.

Every element that made Band of Brother such a incredible experience has been removed and replaced with sex & an incoherent story line. My assumption is that this series is to World War II as ""The Hurt Locker"" is to the current engagement in the Middle East (Having served 3 tours in Iraq, I found the Hurt Locker offensive & misleading.

Having read many of them I've come to this conclusion:

1.) Many conservatives hate it because they think it's an evil Hollywood elitist plot to undermine the good name of our servicemen, rewrite history and prove how much Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and the rest of Hollywood actually hate America.

2.) It has lots of sex scenes.

3.) It isn't as good as Band of Brothers.

But, the war in the pacific wasn't anything like the war in Europe. I think the producers really drive that point home in this series.  Of all the old vets I know, the guys from european theatre never had trouble telling their war stories.  The vets I know from the pacific theatre rarely said a thing.

1168754,5,6305837325,"World War II was a very different war in the Pacific than in Europe.  Gone were the familiar places, people who looked like you and the comforts of civilization.  They were replaced by ""far away places with strange sounding names"" many lacking even the most basic infrastructure.  If you saw civilians, they bore little resemblance to Americans.  You fought a ferocious enemy that operated under a different set of the rules of war.  This resulted in a war where surrender was all but impossible and mercy was never expected.
Drawing heavily on the memories of two Marines, Robert Leckie and Eugene B. Sledge, the HBO miniseries looks at this war.  The ten episodes follow one or both of them in battle and in camp from 1942 to 1946.  Battle is brutal, bloody and deadly, camp is boring.  The combination is deadly producing almost unbearable strain on the men.  The camera never flinches giving us a look at the reality of this war.
The acting is excellent.  The writing is sharp while following two of the best books from the theater.  Late in the series, one character says, ""You will never know what these men have been through.""  Thanks to this series, we do have an idea.",1291075200,5,1177,4.660194174757281

This is not Band of Brothers and should never be compare with it.  This is a stand alone mini-series, as it should be.  A must view by all in Blue Ray and all the extras just make the series better and give the views a much better understanding of what the Marines faced and the time line.

I just watched the 10th episode of the Pacific and I wish it had many more, besides the special episodes, it could have easily had many more episodes. It takes many episodes to develop the many characters that weave in and out through the series. I watched Band of Brothers many times before I thought I fully understood many of the character's roles. Band of Brothers is the ultimate masterpiece of war movies, with Saving Private Ryan and The Pacific both a very close 2nd. They shouldn't be compared to one another, but augment and round out the historical perspective of World War II. I didn't like all the episodes of The Pacific, but I could say the same about Band of Brothers. There are many excellent reviews here, and I don't want to repeat much of the same, but if you enjoyed Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan, you will probably enjoy many of the episodes, if not all.

These movies also provide me with some personal healing, since it helps me to understand my deceased father, who lost his leg in Belgium in World War II. The aftermath of war takes it's toll on many people, and Spielberg/Hanks bring out the emotions and postwar trauma in The Pacific and BOB.

1168758,5,6305837325,"I recently watched the entire PACIFIC presentation and was very impressed. I joined the Marine Corps in January 1950 and during my twenty years of service, had the good fortune to meeet some of the featured Marines in THE PACIFIC.  Right out of boot camp I was assigned to the 2nd Marine Division which moved to Camp Pendleton and became the 1st Marine Division in July of 1950. A couple of months later I made the landing at Inchon, Korea, was at the Chosin Reservoir and another seven months of combat.
  As a combat veteran, I consider myself to be an excellent judge of combat being portrayed in movies and video presentations. PACIFIC was among the most realistic of any movie or video presentation I've ever seen. Right up there with ""Band of Brothers,"" ""Platoon,"" and the first eighteen minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan.""
  If you want to see what real combat is like - watch PACIFIC.  - Pete Sparkes, Capt. USMC Ret",1291075200,4,922,4.625766871165644
1168765,2,6305837325,"LOVED ""Band of Brothers"" for a lot of reasons.  This, I'm sorry to say...not so much.

The actor who played Eugene Sledge was so completely unbelievable and unlikable as a U.S. Marine I couldn't get into any of his scenes, distracted by the constant thought ""Okay, so I wonder who this guy was related to, to get cast here?  Shouldn't he be auditioning for the 'Nutcracker?' ""  I realize the filmmakers were trying to have a character with an arc with ""Sledge"" (going from green to hardened veteran) but you've got to have someone the audience finds likable, and the actor playing ""Sledge"" was annoying with a capital ""A.""

And his psycho sidekick ""Shelton"" was also so completely unlikable and unbelievable as a U.S.  Marine (did they really allow people creepier than Hannibal Lecter in the armed forces?), again it made each of his scenes painful to watch.  There's enough on the screen to make you squirm, we didn't need a sullen faced nerd and a Southern psychopath added to the mix.

And with ""Shelton,""  it appears they wanted to show that some Marines had stopped seeing the enemy as human, but it doesn't work when you have a character more suited for a scene from ""Deliverance"" (remember the guy with one tooth playing the banjo on the back of the truck?  Well, ""Shelton"" is creepier than that guy).  You've just got to have likable characters in the midst of such grotesque violence for the audience to want to stay with the whole thing.

The ""Leckie"" character was good, but I would have loved to have seen an even stronger character like Sgt. Winters from ""Band of Brothers,"" as well as time spent on the ships with the men.  Instead, we get scenes in Australia??  Nice, and beautifully photographed, but not what fans of ""Band of Brothers"" most wanted to see.

Considering the $200 million they spent making this, they just could have done a heck of a lot better.

1168773,4,6305837325,"I can't believe anyone would call this series unpatriotic, or anti-Marine. I obviously can't comment on how realistic it is, but I do know that it never showed Marines as anything more or less than human. They did what they had to do to overcome an entrenched, resourceful and determined enemy and they were permanently scarred by what they experienced. I fail, utterly, to see how that would offend anyone who calls themself a patriot. I sure get tired of people who see a political agenda simply because the American military men are not cut from the John Wayne mold. These men were fully human, and the immense pressure of war made have made some of their behavior hard to look at. But that's not a ""political agenda"" and only a true ideologue would see it that way.

For fans of ""Band Of Brothers"" ( which I am ) it shows a completely different war fought under completely different circumstances. The European and Pacific wars had little in common except their goal of bringing an end to bloodshed started by a tyrants. It falls slightly short in it's off-the-battlefield character development, but only in some minor ways. Other than this it is a great and engrossing series that makes a fine companion piece to ""Band Of Brothers"", although ""The Pacific"" is definitely the more violent of two. This reflects the radically different strategic and tactical goals of the two wars, not an arbitrary decision to make the series bloodier.

After watching this series and thoroughly enjoying it, I am even more grateful to the U.S. Marines who sacrificed their lives or were left physically and/or mentally disabled. If the effect of ""The Pacific"" was to create sentiment of the anti-military variety, it failed miserably in that regard with me. These young men were the best of America, and they fought battles they didn't ask for with courage and tenacity that 99% of us will never need to display. I am proud to be an American and the father of a U.S. Marine. This series has only reinforced these feelings and entertained me immensely along the way.",1290902400,3,2052,4.76123595505618

1168794,4,6305837325,"WWII's Pacific Theater as seen through the eyes and emotions of three Marines -- Robert Leckie, John Basilone and Eugene Sledge - is the epic, 10-part miniseries that artfully recaptures extraordinary combat, heroism and loss of these intertwined lives as they fight the Japanese.  It's all here in a wide range of terrifying terrain -- from the spirit infested jungles of Guadalcanal, through the nearly impassable rain forests of Cape Gloucester, along the coral strongholds of Peleliu, up the dark steep of Iwo Jima and the fatal fields of Okinawa to the final, uneasy return home -- for some, the scariest place of all.

In a way, the experience of this powerful show informs and perhaps transforms the viewer with a sense of the physical and psychological toll combat requires when up against a relentless enemy unlike any in modern warfare up to this point.

Now, it's the Taliban who seek a similar holy victory in a desert theater.  As the French say, ""Plus a change, plus c'est la mme chose.""",1290297600,2,1001,4.83625730994152

Unlike Band of Brothers, it was extremely hard to care for any of the characters, or should I say caricatures?
And yes, racial antipathy played a role in the Pacific War, but on both sides.  Even today the Japanese are very racially-oriented (we would call them racists but that seems to be a term reserved exclusively for white, male, Americans).

The utter lack of context was disturbing.  The brutality and atrocities displayed by Marines was NOT as widespread as the series implies and gave scant credence to the widespread and well-known actions of the Japanese on American captives, POW's, and civilian populations (the ""Rape of Nanking"", anyone?).

Hanks and Spielberg played to the Hollywood crowd in this series and left the rest of us to wonder why we watched it.

I wish there were such a thing as a ""do-over"" for this series.  The Marines deserved better than what Hanks and Spielberg gave them.

I have read ""With The Old Breed"" and this series shows what Sledge wrote in his account.  Of course we did brutal things in the war, its war!  The men that fought in the battles saw what the Japanese did to their friends and others.  So, they hated them it made good people do bad things so they and others could make it home.  So, that I can sit here on my butt getting fat typing this.  You that speak ill of this series read ""With The Old Breed"" and you will think different.  This was the most emotional thing I have ever watched in my 26 years of life.  I am not ashamed to say I cried many times throughout it and the interviews at the end.

1168806,4,6305837325,"War is unforgiving. We see nobility and horrors in a mixed display that demonstrates what makes us unique but also how compassionate we can be as well as unmoored from our own morality some of us can become if the circumstances are forced upon us. Both are on display in ""The Pacific"" a companion piece to the exceptional ""Band of Brothers"". ""The Pacific"" gives us the perspective of the average Marine fighting in the Pacific theater during World War II. My father served in the Pacific on Tinian island towards the end of his service in the military but prior to that had fought in some truly difficult areas in the Pacific and while he was reluctant to share much from his days fighting the Japanese, his stories are well reflected in ""The Pacific"" a terrific mini-series that aired on HBO and was produced by Tom Hanks (like its predecessor ""Band of Brothers"") and Steven Spielberg.

Many other reviews have suggested that this mini-series is anti-American because it focuses on atrocities committed by U.S. Marines during the World War II; I couldn't disagree more. The focus of this film ISN'T on the Japanese side and, yes, it's pretty well known that they committed horrible atrocities during WWII (and before)including but the Rape of Nanking, medical experiments conducted on other Asian peoples (such as giving plague contaminated food to villages and then dissecting their victims while still alive after; drenching people with water in freezing temperatures to discover whether or not the effects of frost bite could be reversed, etc.)and considered anyone who wasn't Japanese to be inferior instead it focuses on our side and what we did both good and bad during the war. ""The Pacific"" let's us peak through the crack and see some of what happened including what veterans faced during and after battle.

I rented the DVD prior to buying the Blu-ray and while the DVD looks quite good some of the night scenes are a bit murky and indistinct so, if you have a Blu-ray player, I'd suggest going with the sharper, clearer and more vibrant looking Blu-ray set. It's more expensive but the action is more distinct and image clarity is remarkably good. Audio is outstanding throughout the series with a nice active presentation in the surround speakers.

Producers Tom Hanks and Steve Spielberg insured that the show based on a pair of books by two former soldiers Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie who served in the Pacific was as accurate as possible consulting with experts on World War II. There has been some debate about the atrocities shown where some U.S. soldiers committed (taking the gold fillings out of a deceased Japanese soldiers mouth for example)and while no atrocity is excusable (and the Japanese military committed their fair share of them as well)but every war is filled with stories of nobility, courage and compassion just as it is filled with horror stories. ""The Pacific"" gives us a balanced view in an environment where killing and surviving are the two most important things without white washing history or making one side look more savage than the other. Keep in mind though that this is the story of OUR troops not the Japanese so the focus is as it should be on what we did both good and bad.

The extras include the following: timeline for events, two Blu-ray-exclusive interactive companion features across all 10 parts: Enhanced Viewing, Field Guide Profiles of The Pacific: Delve into the lives of the real Marines featured in The Pacific.

We also get ""Making The Pacific"" which take us behind the scenes and take an inside look at the making of the miniseries and ""Anatomy of the Pacific War"": allowing us to explore the historical influences and cultural perceptions that led to the merciless brutality in the Pacific theater of World War II.

I would have liked to have production commentary tracks from the actors, writers, directors, producers as well as commentary tracks from military/history advisors to give us perspective but that is a small complaint for such an exceptional series.

Keep in mind that ""The Pacific"" isn't ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" or any of the ""big"" Hollywood World War II films that were popular in the 50's and 60's--""The Pacific"" focuses on the common soldiers, their experience, the sense of brotherhood fighting under horrible conditions, the good, bad and the ugly of battle. This smaller, more intimate presentation allows the producers to focus on the characters not the events and that's all to the good. Highly recommended.",1290211200,,4496,4.931307793923382
1168807,5,6305837325,"This HBO Series makes history personal. It is a very personal history of some of the men who fought in WW II. The story line follows these men through their day-to-day experience of fighting in the Pacific. If you have an aversion to blood, gore, and violence (cold and hot blooded), I wouldn't suggest this series. However, the displays of these things are not gratuitous.

The displays of violence, blood, and gore are displayed matter-of-factly in a very stark and realistic way, just the way that these events happened. This is a very real dipiction of war. There are no excuses made. No quarter is asked and none is given.

This war, like most wars, was fought mostly by ordinary men called on to do extroadinary and heroic things. It did for the Pacific what&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Band-of-Brothers/dp/B00005NNM5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Band of Brothers</a>&nbsp;did for Europe in much the same way, so if you loved Band of Brothers, you'll love this.

While I was watching this show, it was so real that it almost felt like I was there. I believe that this was intentional. Of course, I'm very glad that I wasn't there.

It makes me want to do more in-depth research because these battles were in some really out-of-the-way places, and it makes me wonder why battles were fought in places like Guadalcanal. Of course, this series was not intended to provide a detailed history, but provided only enough detail to let you know where you were.

In my opinion, the places themselves were not the interesting part of the story but the battles themselves and the men who fought them. This, the Series portrays in intimate detail.

This series was based on several books written by (or about) the men portrayed in it. These books are probably described somewhere in the product description.

1168808,4,6305837325,"The Pacific, quite simply, is powerful, compelling, horrific, tragic, human, inhuman, and an accurate represenation of what it meant to be a US Marine dropped into the fiery hell of combat with the fanatical Japanese across seemingly meaningless atolls strewn across the South Pacific.

The production values of this DVD set are incredibly high and realistic throughout. You will feel every emotion when you watch it. There is no holding back here. This is the brutality of war like has rarely been seen. It will bring you to tears and you will wonder how on Earth any of these men could have survived much less retained their sanity.

The 3 main characters whose eyes the story is told through are all unique in their own way and give the viewer the ability to view the horror of war as if they were one of their buddies right along side. Robert Leckie is the brash young newspaper writer who shows us that the will to survive in the face of total insanity is indeed doable. John Basilone is the reluctant hero of Guadalcanal. He is a man's man, a marine through and through who shows us all what a true leader should be. And then there is the shy country boy, Eugene Sledge, who along with his comrades experienced more than anyone could take but found a way to cope and enjoy a very successful life after the war.

All of these stories needed to be told. And I feel humbled and richer for finally seeing how it actually was for these men.

The only reasons I gave it 4 stars were because I felt, especially with the first few episodes, that they were a bit too short. I would have liked to have had better introductions to the characters. But by the time I had finished watching all 10 episodes and viewing all the bonus features this was not as big a problem as I felt initially. I also was not particularly happy with the number of sexually oriented scenes because I felt they were thrown in merely to titilate and did not really help the story at all. We all know these men met women while on liberty. No need to exploit this to the degree as was shown. After seeing Bob Leckie's widow in the Special Features I actually felt sorry that she would have to view her husband making love to another woman and having it so graphically depicted.

But those are just small quibbles. This is a great mini-series and anyone who loved Band of Brothers (My all time favorite!) should really enjoy this. I also believe that watching it multiple times will increase your appreciation for what they have done here. And the musical score is fantastic as well. I just love that opening theme!

Hanks even made mention of this when the series was in production.

As far as realistic, forget it. The series is centered on characters of no significance that add NOTHING to the series. Apparently, they thought it would make it more ""female"" friendly than Band of Brothers. The story line is stupid and it also shows Americans in a bad light. They skip Iwo Jima completely and Guadalcanal and Peleliu appear to be years apart. Don't expect to gain any historical perspective from this.

If Tom Hanks wanted to show how much he hates America, this is a great start. I advise any WWII vets to have your meds nearby before you watch this trash.

This series deserves 5 stars just for the fact that it lets people like us know what others have done to protect our freedom. The story does jump around a tiny bit but its because this series follows a group of men who knew each other but were not together through the majority of the war. The story follows three main characters, John Basalone who was the marines first recipient of the medal of honor, Robert Leckie and Eugene Sledge, who both wrote books about their accounts in the Pacific.

This movie is a record of the grim realities of war and the price that is paid for freedom. This movie illustrates not only the physical sacrifies made by the men and women in the military but also the psychological and emotional sacrifies and wounds endured.

The story is pointless, beyond showing the atrocities of war but it  has no soul, and during the whole series you get no one to relate with or to identify you with...

In Band of Brothers you were able to actually follow your favorite character and to relate with them when ever a brother fell you could actually feel sorry...

here, there is no brotherhood... they are all just numbers. If the kid from Jurassic Park dies I couldn't care less... Before, I was hoping and crossing my fingers to see  Winters Malarky and LUZ make it through the war!!

The Pacific brings lots of blood but no soul. and the first 4 episodes BORING AS a fkn Clam!!

Sure... it is a nice metal box which belongs to every war collection... but I saw it once and to be honest I won't be seeing it again.

Band of Brothers and Ryan, i watch those once a year since I got my metal box a long time ago and the one that looks like a bullet case (Ryan)

EY!!!  How great would have been in Band of Brothers to see Hanks dressed as Cpt. Miller or any one other of the guys?... asking Winters just for a couple of seconds... ""Do you have a Private Ryan on your outfit?"" Ryan was an Airborne!! no?

1168837,2,6305837325,"I enjoyed Band of Brothers and was expecting a similar style and performance with The Pacific.

Unfortunately, this production was too ambitious and the producers tried to cover too much ground. Band Of Brothers centered around the actions of a handful of characters, from June 1944 to May 1945. The Pacific tries to cover the entire Pacific war --from start to end and also tries to work in character development at the same time.

As a result, the episodes were a bit scaterred and inconsisent and there were large gaps in time. An entire episode was devoted to the liberty antics of Marines in Australia. When your formidable goal is to try to cover the entire Pacific campaign and you only have 10, 45-minute episodes to work with, this probably is not the most prudent use of time.

As far as character development, it was spotty and the characters were not given enough screen time for a viewer to connect with any specific individual. I connected more with the characters by watching the bonus documentary than the film--the bonus biography sections were actually the best part of the set, IMO.

The action and visuals were well-done in typical Speilberg fashion. But I believe that the gore factor has reached it's limit. Viewers are now so used to seing this style that it has lost it's impact. We get it --war is bloody and violent. There are only so many ways to show someone with their insides hanging out before the viewer is desensitized to it and it serves no purpose. In many cases, it has become gratuitous in this style of film. It was riveting and schoking in Saving Private Ryan. It is now more often than not ust a distraction.

Unlike band of brothers, PAcific never gelled for me emotionally. It wasn't until Episode 9, based on Okinawa, that I started to feel somehwat of Emotional, simply Episode 9 in Okinawa. Ended abruptly without really knowing any more about the characters or.

IMO, the producers would have been better served if they would have set a more modest goal akin to Band of Brothers and started the series with the landing at Iwo Jima and followed through to the conclusion of the war. Pacific tried to cover too much ground by going from the homefront after Pearl Harbor all the way to to VJ Day and follow-up on the home-front.

I purchased the series based on reviews. I addedd this to my collection but I doubt it will get another viewing. It was not one of the best series to come from Speilberg.",1289779200,25,2443,4.61520737327189

The movie is based on real marines like the truly great John Basilone , he sets a standard that marines still look up to, but with all modern war flicks we do get two many scenes of people going nuts. Sure this happens but you only had ten hours here to compress several biograaphy books into a whole. However the pacific was savage on a whole other level with the japanese desire to take as many people with them making the marines view them as monsters that were no longer human.  That is the fact of this situation which does get some play with mothers and babys strapped with bombs coming at the poor marines. Ok, this still shows how serving in some of the battles of the pacific that the survival rate was not so good. But beyond that you get a good feeling of the suffering and heartbreak that these men endured. They really suffered beyong the limits of human endurance and so did the really tough japanese soldiers. It is forgotten though that the japanese empire had become under tojo,  a genocidal war machine bent on mass slaughter and the marines were not there for the same purposes , if the japanese had surrendered and not behaved the way they did then the whole thing wouldn't have been tipped into the horror it was.  One thing that this movie slides over is the fact that japanese slaughtered tons of civilians , however these flick cover the fighting on remote islands so we don't get that perspective.  This is worth seeing on many levels and the acting is superb from the whole cast who were  really dedicated to this project. It's a major achievement in some ways but it's not perfect. The backstories are not boring either they are very real and to the point.  The print looks great on this and you could do worse than own this blu ray set.",1289692800,,1812,4.426426426426427

1168843,3,6305837325,"After I watched Band of Brothers, I thought ""I hope they do the same thing for the Pacific..."" Because Band of Brothers is the best WWII movie in my book. I wanted to see what they could do with the war in the Pacific. When I read that The Pacific was being developed, I was overwhelmed with excitement.

Having now watched The Pacific, that excitement has transformed to 'eh.'

The Pacific surpasses Band of Brothers in one, and only one, aspect of film making; special effects. That's it. Story telling, character development, acting...Band of Brothers is by far the better production. That isn't to say that The Pacific is not good, it is, but I was expecting more...and expecting less sex, and obscene language. Granted, the language present in The Pacific is likely a watered down version of reality. At the same time, I'm watching The Pacific for entertainment, and I don't really enjoy an abundance of obscene language. In the Band of Brothers, obscene language was present, but it was used in a manner that was not distracting. As for the sex...I don't need to see it, and I don't think it adds anything to the story. (I'm a 27 year old man; I'm not a prude. I just enjoy good film making, and I don't think sex or an abundance of obscene language adds anything to films.). Love scenes could have easily been implied, and the film wouldn't have skipped a beat.

I also thought the gore was a bit much too. When you see a soldiers leg get blown off several times, or a man attempting to put his guts back in, and the only purpose of the shot is to show that...it's cliche. It's Spielberg pulling from his Saving Private Ryan experience. Obviously, it's war and war is violent; but I thought it distracted from the story a bit.

I'm not a historian, so I cannot comment about the accuracy of the film. However, there really isn't much lead up to major battles. In Band of Brothers, there were two episodes that led up to D-Day. Halfway into the first episode of The Pacific, that battle has begun. That sort of sums up the film...nothing really develops, it just happens; and that goes for the characters too.

Band of Brothers did an excellent job of character development. Each character had a personality that was uniqe...I cared what happened to the characters. Not so much in The Pacific. They all play sort of a rough and tough role.

Overall, I thought The Pacific had good moments, and had some just OK moments. Band of Brothers is by far a better film in my book. I'd give Band of Brothers a 10, and The Pacific a 6.5.",1289520000,28,2533,4.507625272331155
1168844,4,6305837325,"I know it's a bit unfair to judge ""The Pacific"" in comparison to ""Band of Brothers,"" but its almost impossible not too, especially since its marketed that way. Band of Brothers is amazing, so anything judged against that backdrop has an automatic disadvantage. With that being said, The Pacific is a well-made mini-series in and of itself. You can tell from the get-go that the producers gave this miniseries an extremely high budget.

Where it kind of falls short, again, in comparison to Band of Brothers, is that we are almost disconnected from the alot of the characters in the series. This is due to a couple of reasons. First, Unlike BofB, where we follow Easy Company from bootcamp to the D-Day and beyond, The Pacific almost throws us into the war against Japan immediately. Because of that, I didn't feel emotionally connected to the characters until way later on. Another byproduct, or in conjunction to it, of throwing us into the war immediately, is that it isn't until the third ""episode"" or so, that you really know who is whom (throw in a bunch of marines in uniform, and it can get pretty confusing). Second, where we follow a company of soldiers in BofB, The Pacific follows three indidvidual characters. So when their buddies get blown up to smitherieenes, as they often do, stictly in the sense of a movie-watcher- because I didn't develop any attachment to those ""side"" characters- I didn't really feel a great emotional tug. For example, in one episode, as one of the main character's buddy gets killed, we see by his acting that he is really distraught, however, I was left thinking ""who was that?""

Another thing I found strange- and I say this without knowing which is more accurate (BofB or The Pacific) is that the Americans in the Pacific seem to be more grotesque than the Soldiers in Europe. Certainly, they were much more liberal with their usage of the F-word and ""Mother F-ers"" than in BofB. All the while  writers/director of the Pacific seemed to be more ""racially sensitive."" I don't know if that was a conscious effort, but in BofB Americans referred to the Nazis as ""Krauts"" a deragatory term for Germans. We know from history, that Americans during WWII were more racist against Japanese who they viewed as savages, while Germans were more like ""cousins."" But in the Pacific the American Marines referred to the Japanese only as ""Japs,"" and not more offensive words, though we know they used them. Another reason why I found the Soldiers in The Pacific to be more grotesque, is that they seemed to ""break"" much easier, and more often. Two of the three main characters seem to jump back and forth between insanity and ""normality"" quite often.

Strictly on the basis of film watching, there are a couple things the Pacific could have done better at. For example, in BofB there were a few episodes that were really creative (the Episode where in the opening scene Major Winters shoots a surrendering SS soldier comes to mind) including some with a narrative. This is lacking in The Pacific. The Pacific is strictly a linear detail of events. Creativity on the level of BofB, narration, and interviews of actual soldeirs the series is based upon is totally lacking.

As a historical event, you truly feel appreciative of these men- these are true stories afterall. However from a standpoint of filmwatching, the Pacific is a bit of a disappointment- partly because of the development (or lack thereof) of the series, and partly because of the unfair comparison to BofB. As a stand-alone mini series, The Pacific is a very solid piece of work. Just don't expect it to be on the same level as BofB.",1289433600,5,3630,4.764705882352941
1168855,4,6305837325,"It's very tempting to compare The Pacific to the Band of Brothers, the HBO WWII miniseries that preceded it by several years. And in that comparison, I'm afraid The Pacific falls short. It is less cohesive. Viewers may find themselves less invested in the characters. And there's no way around it -- The Pacific is very, very bleak and dark. To say that it's antiwar, though, or that it portrays Marines in a negative light is too simple, not to mention too naive.

It's no secret that, post-Vietnam, war films have been darker, bleaker, and more morally ambiguous. Despite that, Band of Brothers was still fairly conventional. Yes, it was rough, but the guys were still heroes watching out for each other and fighting for their country. The point of The Pacific seems to be that war is pure hell, especially on these barren, rainy, muddy Pacific islands littered with bodies and debris. If Band of Brothers was about brotherhood and honor, The Pacific is about survival. It seems to ask, ""how do you survive something like war on Guadalcanal or Iwo Jima, not just physically but mentally?"" And, it turns out, that was incredibly difficult to do. Yes, there is some explicit sex and violence. If you want a feel-good war hero movie, look elsewhere. If you want a realistic but sympathetic portrayal of men fighting in the most horrible conditions imaginable, watch The Pacific.

It's not something you pop in the DVD player or Blu-ray player for a fun, easy watch. It's something that you let sink into your heart and mind. You let it teach you lessons about the depths and heights of human possibility.",1289433600,6,1603,4.762589928057554
1168856,3,6305837325,"Having read both ""Helmet for my Pillow"", and ""With the Old Breed"", I have been looking forward to ""The Pacific"" for a long time. I wanted very much to like this miniseries, but it did not quite deliver. And to preface this review, I want to say that contrary to some, I believe that comparisons of ""The Pacific"" to ""Band of Brothers"" are not only inevitable, but valid. One is a companion to the other, made by the same people, about the same war.

My main complaint about ""The Pacific"" is the lack of depth of both the story and the characters. This, in comparison to ""Band of Brothers"" in which both characters and story had great depth. ""The Pacific"" attempts to weave three different stories into one (this also affects the cohesiveness of the story). Although I had no problem separating the three main characters, many of the others just blend together, one not much different than the other (""Snafu"" being the one exception). I think the series would have been better served if the John Basilone story had been dropped, and that time spent giving more depth to the stories of Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie.

Another problem for me is that two episodes are given to stories surrounding the relationship with the women that two of the characters (Leckie and Basilone) are involved with. Many war stories include love stories, and sometimes it works. In this series I don't think that it did.

And finally, if you are looking for acting performances of the quality given by Damien Lewis, Ron Livingston, and others in ""Band of Brothers"", I think you will be disappointed. The characters in ""Band of Brothers"" were natural and believable in their roles. In my opinion, this is not always the case in ""The Pacific"".

On the plus side, most of the combat sequences are incredible. They were done as well as any in ""Band of Brothers"". Also, the reproduction of the terrain that the battles were fought on is excellent. Kudos for both those things. Some of the small detail is very impressive. There are things that only veterans of the period, or experts, would pick up on. I saw that some characters were wearing I.D. bracelets on their wrists like the ones unique to the Marines of that period. The only way I know this is because my father's lies in a box in my desk drawer. How many others will notice? Detail like that, must be applauded, and there was a lot of that in ""The Pacific"".

Bottom line for me was that there was a certain lack of depth and cohesiveness in both the story, and the characters. This was a disappointment. Although you might find buying the DVDs worthwhile for the battle scenes alone, my advice would be to read ""Helmet for my Pillow"" and ""With the Old Breed"" to really get the stories in depth.",1289433600,33,2728,4.593429158110883
1168857,3,6305837325,"I was reading the reviews prior to watching and didn't pay attention to many of them. One of them caught my eye though about how the story doesn't pick up until episode 5.  I would say spot on.  Overall, this HBO Series is not very good.  I was expecting a lot better in terms of story, drama, war scenes...everything.  Just not very good.
Summary:

Good:
1. The scene where the traks are heading to Peleliu - this is amazing and puts your right there on that day - mesmerizing scene - the best of the entire series...if you buy this it will be for this scene alone.
2. Episode on Okinawa - gives you the feel of how miserable it was there and how intense the battles could be
3. The transition scenes that zoom in on Map prior to each location/battle is superbly done

Bad:
1. Too much sex - no need for it...can't watch with kids under 17 really because of this
2. Japanese Soldiers seemed unrealistic - I mean it constantly showed them as stupid/dumb and zombie like just running into machine gun fire time and time again with no strategy or direction...Anyone who knows world War II and studies it knows the Japanese soldiers to be fierce and tough but definitely not stupid and zombie like. Made it seem like it was too easy for Marines to fight Japanese and we all know that was the entire opposite of what happened in Pacific War....Director/Writers really blew it on this one (shame on you Spielberg,Hanks!)
3. Not enough battle scenes, too many boring parts/dialogue and scenes in pavavuu, australia...away from the key battles...if they had focused each battle like the okinawa one...this would be compelling story....too much drag time.

Overall, not a good series...could have had so much more and been a classic...but looks like Hanks and Spielberg just stamped their name on this thing and kicked back and let people buy in based on real work done on Band of Brothers...greed and laziness produce bad results...too bad.",1289433600,8,1933,4.651026392961877

1168859,2,6305837325,"I just finished seeing the entire 10 hours of the Pacific over the last few days and realized that the deterioration in the story is purposely done by the Producers of the film to show that atrocities that war drives people to commit and how humans are reduced to animals after being in combat for some time.  The first 2 hours are good and try to balance the reality of battle with the purpose of it and even focus on the first winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor in the Pacific.  After the first two hours though, this film is not worth watching unless you enjoy seeing endless blood and body parts with no scenes of valor that redeem those who are fighting.  I would recommend watching the first two hours only and definitely skipping the rest of the 10 hours due to the constant depravity that is emphasized during the rest of the film.  In the end, the Producers of the film are just anti war and want to use the Pacific to further their anti war agenda at the cost of harming the image and memory of the marines who fought and died or were wounded in the Pacific.  In other words, more Marine misconduct and atrocities are shown that scenes of courage and valor.",1289347200,10,1175,4.371559633027523

1168861,5,6305837325,"Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and HBO congratulations for making this epic piece of history of the Pacific Theater.  I was a huge fan of BOB and was excited to finally get to watch ""The Pacific"".  I recently received my Blu-Ray version from Amazon and I started watching it and could not stop.  I watched all 10 episodes and was just as memorized as I was watching the BOB series.

Now, this is not BOB2, ""The Pacific"" focuses on 3 Marines and their endeavors in the Pacific Theater, not a company of Airborne in the European Theater.  These two Theaters and the enemies that were fought were completely different. This series brings on a whole new look to the struggles and turmoil's that the Marines suffered.  This was about the mental trauma suffered as well as the physical.  This series was just as heart wrenching as BOB.

Finally, I hope that Hanks and Spielberg can come out with another great series like BOB and ""The Pacific"" but on the Navy.  How the Pacific was won with the great carrier and air battles.",1289347200,2,1016,4.569060773480663

I suppose that did not lend itself to this particular series, which was following certain Marines during that island-hopping war.  I would like to see a series on the Navy in the Pacific War.

1168864,4,6305837325,"One the whole, one of the best war epics ever presented and follows the superb books it was based on and it is a tribute to the great young Marines who gave so much for their country. The battle scenes were very good with spot-on locales and scenery for Guadalcanal, Peleliu, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Best of all, the actors looked a lot like the Marines they depicted and they were young as they should be. The acting was very good and the direction was spare and vivid - something you almost never see in any war movie. The only gripes I had were that since it is an HBO miniseries there had to be the usual incongruous sex scenes and periods of irrelevant blather and movie sound people that can never capture the real sounds of a firefight or near misses or high explosives: it always sounds like blanks being fired and the usual blackpowder simulators. Ah well - it's probably just as well it isn't too accurate or we'd have the audiences going through their own combat survivor issues afterward! Interestingly, almost nobody threw any grenades - even though they were extensively used, particularly in night combat.
The best part of the series is the ending, where they show the surviving veterans returning and the difficulty they had returning to their ordinary lives again after the hell they'd been through. No movie I have ever seen does a better job of showing the terrible damage done to the human soul after unrelenting and brutal combat.
I recommend this series - it's the best so far.",1289260800,7,1497,4.610486891385768

By the 5th episode I had given up on the series, which seemed to have dedicated inordinate amounts of time swapping back and forth between the drudgery of training to the indiscretions of Marines on leave (all of which you can see elsewhere with better detail).  Further, the almost perpetual state of physical and mental decay amongst the Marines was unrealistic and even absurd at times.  Oh, and where was the Navy in this series?

The series became disinteresting very early, the characters were not likable and the plot devolved into something out of a daytime soap.  Nothing about this series was memorable, with the exception of the memories of the money I won't get back after having bought it.

1168878,3,6305837325,"I liked the stories in this movie.  But if you've done any reading on the subject, like Manchester's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goodbye-Darkness-A-Memoir-of-the-Pacific-War/dp/0316501115/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goodbye, Darkness: A Memoir of the Pacific War</a>&nbsp;then this is not a new subject.  Indeed, when one looks at the old John Wayne movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sands-of-Iwo-Jima/dp/0782010040/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sands of Iwo Jima</a>&nbsp;it could be argued that Wayne's movie is better.  That is the rub with this series.  Band of Brothers is one of the best mini-series ever made on HBO and is equal or better than most WWII movies on the subject.  The old movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Bridge-Too-Far-Blu-ray/dp/B000WC39SG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Bridge Too Far [Blu-ray</a>] isn't as good as Band of Brothers.  Conversely, John Wayne plays a compelling Marine Sergeant in Sands of Iwo Jima and that movie is better than ""The Pacific"".

The movie starts off with Robert Leckie telling a woman in a church that he is off the Marines.  When you read Robert Leckie's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Helmet-for-My-Pillow-From-Parris-Island-to-the-Pacific/dp/0553593315/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Helmet for My Pillow: From Parris Island to the Pacific</a>&nbsp;in the first page the thing he really remembers is the Marines forced him to get circumcised before he could enlist and he's complaining about the pain.  The video is a little different than the book, don't you think?  Eugene Sledge is the story is the same way.  In this series we see somebody who is sickly and becomes a Marine.  In the book Mr. Sledge was at a military academy and enlisted in the Marines because he believed that he was going to miss the was if he had stayed at the academy.

""The Pacific"" starts off with the Marines being placed on Guadalcanal and the soldiers seeing the sinking of the US Navy Fleet during the Battle of Savo Island (the worst beating the US Navy ever had in a battle).  That was pretty good special effects.  The casual viewer is shown what it's like for the Marines.  Their uniforms were rotting off their bodies.  They ate captured Japanese rice that was infested with maggots.  The Marines endured many Japanese suicide attacks.  It is fairly good but what is missed is the Marines underwent nearly nightly ship bombardments.  The viewer is shown one bombardment that lasts for a minute.  The Marines on Guadalcanal had a Japanese battleship empty its guns on them; one of the few times American service members had to endure a battleship bombardment.

I liked the Guadalcanal treatment.  But doing that could have been a whole mini series by itself and an adaptation of the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guadalcanal-Starvation-Island/dp/0935553045/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guadalcanal: Starvation Island</a>&nbsp;would not get HBO a lot of viewers.

I did like the cut away to Australia.  I didn't know that the Marines sent the Marines to Australia to have the men recover from the ordeal at Guadalcanal.  This reminded me of the better parts that the American soldiers had in Europe.  Hats off to the producers for this and a big thumb up.  It sounds like Mr. Leckie's Marines had the time of their life in Australia.  The stories with the women are half true and half fiction.  The fiction is the family stories.  The fact is the women were accomidating to the Marines.

Most of the characters meet up at a central location, the island of Pavuvu; the Marine Corps main depot island in the Pacific.  This is a little made up but was done to bring continuity to the story.  In the post mid-1943 period it was logistically easier to have the marines at Pavuvu than ship them back to Australia.  Pavuvu is a nasty little island that is infested with crabs and rats.  But after the Marines are subject to the horrors of miserable islands like Peleliu it's better than nothing.  At least the food is constant and the medical attention is good.

At Pavuvu the second groups of characters take over from ""Lucky's"" group of Marines.  This is based off the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/With-the-Old-Breed-At-Peleliu-and-Okinawa/dp/0891419195/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa</a>.  This is where the series really falls down and falls down hard.  Iwo Jima's set is unconvincing.  The sets are a series of rocky hills that are used and re-used.  A viewer can see that Iwo's set looks like Peleliu 's set looks like Okinawa's set.  This isn't good and it actually starts having a cheap made-for-TV look that half ruined network TV back in the seventies and eighties.  What was HBO thinking?  Also, this reviewer is an equipment geek.  One Amtrack is used in the series and one M-4 Sherman is used.

The viewer is really cheated if they think this series captures Okinawa.  Okinawa was nightmarish for all the participants in WWII.  Japanese bombers would attack the fleet at night and the sky would light up with thousands of tracers.  Ships would explode and could be seen from the beach.  Japanese suicide bombers would run under tanks and blow themselves up.  The Army and Marines have different ways of fighting and this causes lots of deaths when the US Army would pull back from a position allowing the Marines to be flanked.

I will give any good WWII series three stars.  This is a good series but it hardly touches the surface of what the Marines went through.  Honestly, one is better served by watching Sands of Iwo Jima with John Wayne (link above) or watching this old video&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guadalcanal-Diary/dp/B00005PJ8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guadalcanal Diary</a>.

I rented ""The Pacific"".  I would not buy it.  It's a good three star rental but the characters are not that compelling.  Boot Camp, a miserable experience for any Marine, is not shown in this series.  The producers try to do too much with too little.  And like putting too little butter on a large piece of bread it just does not work well.

And that is the real pity of this video.  Now, the people who like the Navy and the Marines will give this five stars.  But the typical reviewer will only give this three stars and watch it only once or twice.",1289174400,7,6563,5.531658291457286
1168879,5,6305837325,"After reading the negative and positive reviews of the The Pacific and finally viewing the DVD set, I have to say that the series is just astounding.  First of all, comparisons to Band of Brothers (BoB) is inevitable but unnecessary given that the battles in the European and the Pacific theatres were fundamentally different as any professional and avid historian will tell you.  The documentary included in the DVD states this quite poignantly.

As a result, the format and the presentation of the Pacific departs from BoB in that it focuses on 3 Marines (and not an entire combat unit as in BoB), and is much darker and cynical given that the Japanese and the Pacific War in general were far more brutal and savage to the American soldier. If you can understand these differences, the Pacific truly shines as it powerfully conveys how the 3 Marines change from gung-ho idealism to men emotionally and physically tempered by unrestrained combat, a relentless enemy, a brutal environment, and survivor's guilt.

And who are these Marines ? John Basilone, a true-believer of the Marine Corp, who wins the Medal of Honor in Guadacanal, but perishes in Iwo Jima.  Throughout the story, you get the sense that he is on borrowed time, but nevertheless lives his life to the fullest knowing well and good that death awaits him.  Bob Leckie, a Marine who enters the Pacific war not completely understanding what he has gotten into, and as a result finds himself on the brink of insanity as he struggles to make sense of the violence around him. And Eugene Sledge, a Marine who at moments of vicious fighting in Okinawa, finds and loses his humanity, and is left to question why he enlisted, the necessity of the war itself, and why he survived when others did not. In this vein, the Pacific is vastly more psychological than physical which is truly where the conflict lies in each man. Not to say that the violent battles depicted in the series are cheap and gratuitous. Quite the contrary.  They are brutally realistic and assault the very core of these Marines, who are left to comprehend and survive a vicious world turned upside down.

For the reasons cited above, the Pacific is worth owning as it serves to better understand the WWII experience. You won't be disappointed !!",1289174400,3,2274,4.783163265306122
1168880,5,6305837325,"First off, STOP trying to compare this to BOB, it is nothing of the sort! If they were trying to make a BOB2, they would've said so.

The Pacific takes us on a journey with three marines throughout the pacific campaign based on the memoirs of two of the marines: Robert Leckie with his memoir ""Helmet For My Pillow"" and Eugene Sledge with his memoir ""With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa"". The third is John Basilone, a medal of honor recipient.

Considering this is made by the same folks of BOB, the cinematography is nothing short of spectacular with hard emphasis on making it as historically accurate as possible. Everything from the muddy hell of the jungle to the bare rock wasteland battlefields inland, the setting of the shots was expertly done.

One particular difference between BOB (I will not go into much comparison considering how touchy it is to some people...) is that The Pacific spends a significant more time with the marines off the battlefield allowing us to not only experience the men among their comrades but experience the psychological toll that the war was having on them. This in particular really impressed me on how well it was done and you can't help but get attached to the characters quickly and experience the pain and triumphs along with them.

Also, needless to say really, is that the battle scenes are brutally realistic as was done in BOB with an amazing amount of detail. The pacific theater presented new and different terrors rather than the European front. With the Japanese and their fanatical and fearless charges through the ranks of the men to the marines fighting not only the deceptive and clever eastern enemy but also the jungle as well.

I had a grandfather who was a marine sergeant in the pacific, surviving multiple landings such as the likes of Guadalcanal and Iwo Jima. Seeing the pain they went through and the endurance and spirit brought me to tears throughout the series imagining that is what he had to go through, what they all went through. A testament to those who fought and died, The Pacific really does them justice.

The story itself is concerned with the Marines only...and gives no attention to the contributions of the Navy or the Army in the Pacific.

1168883,1,6305837325,"The original book written in typical Ambrose style -- the father started it and his son finished after his death -- tackles the enormous theatre of battle in the Pacific during World War II, obviously through American eyes for the most part.  Like most Ambrose books, it's a compilation of vignettes of different service personnel who fought in various conflicts throughout the war.  Shockingly -- given their reputations -- you have to wonder if Hanks/Spielberg actually read the book before having the screen play developed.  Because ""The Pacific"" the miniseries might as well be a remake named ""Band of Brothers II, How the Marines Won the Pacific War"". There's no question that the Marines did one amazing job at a time when it seemed as if the Japanese were invincible and America barely had enough equipment and decent leadership to get into the fight -- early American military leaders were appallingly bad, simply attrocious and American losses were tragic in the early stages of the war.  Moreover, our service personnel not only had to overcome bad leadership, they also had to deal with massive interservice squabbling and egos and outrageously outdated tactics and equipment.  That said, while the Marines were key to winning the war, the book at least does what the miniseries never does: It spends some time describing the significant role played by our naval personnel, the Army and our Navy and Army pilots in winning the war (i.e. just exactly how did all those marine AND ARMY divisions actually get to those islands? and how did we manage to subdue one of the largest airforces in the world at the time?). With the book, there is some sense of scope and an acknowledgement that our victory in the Pacific was just as much a massive logistical feat as it was a victory of American boys from every walk of life and just about every ethnic background (except the interned Japanese Americans) over a highly trained, very seasoned adversary, that was better equiped in just about every way, at least in the early stages of the conflict.  Instead the miniseries fixates on about four major island engagements and Hanks/Spielberg seem even more determined to turn this into a kind of ""Hills Are Alive Meets Saving Private Ryan"".  Bodies explode.  Skeletons are dug up, there's an amazing amount of blood and gore.  Yes it happened that way, but we are talking about a movie here so you if you know how to direct you can get the point across without exploding mellons, sausages and ketchup at every turn...  More to the point, as if duh, Hanks/Spielberg literally fixate on the copious amounts of sex that occured as young men about to leave home, perhaps for the last time, found women willing to give them a just send off -- we get it.  We know.  We just don't need all the gratuitous nudity and humping that goes with it.  In this regard, Hanks/Spielberg owe the Australians an apology for they way they are portrayed in the miniseries -- simply awful.  Moreover, you can't watch this movie with your kids, which is a real shame because the Pacific region was, is and will be a signficant part of the American story and the Ambrose family did a fairly diligent job of describing a piece of our history in the book.  But add the blood and guts to the sex and chunks of missing history and you've got nothing to do but continue to shield your children's eyes from one section of the miniseries to the next.  I'm almost tempted to send it back to Amazon and get my money back.  Whereas the book did a fair job on the subject the Hanks/Spielberg effort simply stinks.",1289001600,28,3577,4.706730769230769

After reading all the USMC books about the campaigns, and watching this amazing mini-series, I just have one thing to say: ""Thankyou to all the young men who never came back, and the ones who did, and survived the post-war experiences with nightmares from
the war zones. If you find video games your only sense of combat reality, unplug the machines, take a deep breath and watch this with an open mind.

1168905,4,6305837325,"First, this doesn't follow one unit from basic training to war's end like BoB, so it's may not seem as cohesive as BoB (moving in between the three main characters in at least two different units, plus secondary characters).  The Melbourne liberty episode was very boring, by that time i still hadn't connected with the any of the characters to care about how they spent their liberty pass.  The characters in BoB were more fleshed out early on, i think  than in the Pacific.  I think it would have benefitted from more basic training scenes to establish the characters better.

The character I least liked was Leckie, but his best episode was when he ended up at the mental ward on Parvuvu (that was the first time I started to connect with the guy, but that connection was brief since he seemed deemphasized in later episodes when Sledge arrived on the battlefield).  Basilone was a true hero (his heroics on Guadalcanal were inspiring), and his story was very interesting (it was a little slow when he came back stateside, but got better when he arrived at Camp Pendleton and met his future wife).  Sledge, I think, was the real main character (sad seeing the transformation from idealistic boy, to cold killing machine, then later regret for the humanity he lost on the battlefield).

As for the brutality (of the Japanese and some of the Marines) and the racial aspects, well that was the ""DNA"" of the Pacific war.  I've seen many documentaries (I think one included with in the special features) where Pacific vets admit those things did happen.  It's not to excuse or condemn the Marines, but to understand them.  I think it does a disservice to them to deny the racism of the times, or to gloss over their experiences because we don't like it in today's world.  I don't think you can excuse the brutality of the Japanese, however: the Rape of Nanking, the Bataan Death March, etc.  I would hope that I would act differently under similar conditions (an enemy who doesn't surrender, whose wounded kill our medics trying to help them, or who torture prisoners and mutilate the dead), but I am not so sure.

1168907,5,6305837325,"Before this came out on DVD, I spent some time preparing. I read ""With the Old Breed"" by E.B. Sledge and did some research on the Pacific theater as well. But due to reviews on this site, I lowered my expectations. Major mistake.

I think the most impressive thing about the series is the restraint it shows. By the end of ""With the Old Breed"" I had been completely won over by the gut-wrenching and thorough accounts of Sledge's combat in the Pacific. I was concerned that the series would go too far and portray Sledge as an action hero Bruce-Willis-style. But Hanks and co. have done a near perfect job of portraying the events as they occurred in the book. They seem to recognize that any attempt to make the events ""more dramatic"" would would be dishonoring to what those veterans actually went through and that the most heart-breaking story is the true one. As a result episodes 5-7, which all take place on Peleliu, are extremely painful and satisfying at the same time. Of course some license is taken with the events, but these are extremely minor (for ex., even though many of the conversations remain the same, sometimes they are told by different characters) and if the book itself was accurate, than I think the episodes about Sledge must be as well.

Ultimately we will never really know what it was like. But for E.B. Sledge the truth of these events is how they affected him, and the series evokes the same emotional response as the book.

Concerning the rest of the series, I have less of a right to discuss it since I have not read Leckie's book and I know little about Basilone. Suffice it to say, these parts are well done and just as compelling. There seems to be some frustration over certain episodes (like episode 3) and I can understand those complaints (the sexual content exceeds gratuity and is entirely unnecessary for the telling of the story). But overall even these moments portray sides of the war that we rarely think about. The trauma did not stay on the battlefield. The survivors went home to a society that was broken up over their extended absence and amazed at what they had become.

I do know parts of their stories were not told in detail, you will have to read their books to obtain the full impact of their ordeal, John Basolone for instance served in the U.S.army in the Philippines prior to Pearl Harbor and had many friends on the Bataan Death March, his time in the Philippines
was barely mentioned in this series, the fall of Bataan and Wake Island likewise not mentioned at all.
other than that the work was superb,speilburg was outstanding in his authenticity of the backdrop, the equipment the marines used, and was historically accurate in every detail.

I know that there is no pleasing everyone, but for me it is hard to find much to criticize about 'The Pacific'.

1168914,3,6305837325,"I loved ""Band of Brothers"" and was very happy when ""the Pacific"" after years of discussion became a reality.  Unfortunately, that reality was often disappointing although there were bright spots.

One thing that I think is pretty much undeniable is that unlike ""Band of Brothers"" the story in ""the Pacific"" lacked cohesion.  It jumped back and forth from character to character and it didn't have the same wallop that ""Band of Brothers"" did by showing one group of men who fought together in a series of battles.

The Good Parts

1.  The fighting on Pelelieu was incredibly well done.  I had no idea until seeing the series that it was bad as that.

2.  The scenes on Okinawa had similar impact.

The Bad Parts

1.  The Australia leave episode...nothing particularly wrong with it but it was totally expendable and slowed down the narrative (and I understand that the Leckie romance that was the central part of it was fictional anyway, so why bother?)

2.  Leckie and his problem with bed wetting:  The episode that focused on Leckie's embarrassing problem really was the nadir of the series to me. I know that things like this happen in war but they are just not ""cinematic"" and the last thing I want to spend time watching.

3.  The fact that the entire series never showed any of the Marines taking prisoners.  I know that the Pacific theater was possibly more merciless than the European theater, but I think it would have been good to show the protagonists of the story actually seeing the enemy up close after they'd surrendered (and some Japanese did surrender and did not get shot while trying to do so).

4.  Tom Hanks' asinine comments about the war being charged with racism and vengeance were a major turn off to me.  I have no doubt that racism (on both sides) was present but ""you live when you live"" and it's infuriating to see someone judging events that happened a long time ago with sensibilities that have become predominant only recently.

Overall, I was very disappointed and I don't see myself buying this DVD set.  I can only hope that Hanks and company do a series about other forgotten wars like Korea or maybe World War I or the Italian campaign in WWII.  I'd be eager to see those.",1288396800,15,2209,4.619537275064268
1168924,4,6305837325,"I've read two of the books on which this screenplay was based - Sledge's ""With the Old Breed"" and Leckie's ""Helmet for a Pillow."" Doing justice to these accounts would be tough, but the series was a worthwhile effort. Four stars is a fair rating in my opinion.

When the series was being televised, I heard some complaining, bordering on whining in one case, that the series was ""no Band of Brothers,"" i.e. boring. I appreciated The Pacific's lack of treacly sentiment- something  that came through in Band of Brothers- my opinion of course. In the interest of disclosure, some of my compatriots are easily bored, and the non-battle sequences were clearly equivalent to walking on hot coals for them- some of these guys can't watch a movie without yakking on their Smartphones several times throughout. If you have attention deficit, maybe steer clear of trying to watch this.

Thanks to the producers and directorial staff for trying to make a fair account of how the Marines lived, loved, wondered about their futures, and fought a vicious enemy in often appalling conditions. I won't minimize the sacrifice of these men by complaining that depictions of their lives don't have enough action.

There is very much time spent on backstory and the ""homefront"" which is interesting and ""real"" but not compelling viewing.  It seems story was sacrificed for ""realism"" and some of the episodes are boring and/or depressing.  Again I'm sure this is what war was like and it is a perspective we need to have.  However, it is not good cinema.  The war in the Pacific was a brutal ""no prisoners"" sort of war and it was more brutal and nasty than the Western Front in WWII.  Focusing on the problems that created for individual soldiers is necessary to give a true account of the conflict.  I don't see the need to have that issue take up an entire episode.  The Pacific doesn't give you a feel for the broad conflict and at times it felt like the rest of the war didn't exist.  After the first few episodes I no longer looked forward to watching the future episodes.  I recorded the show when it was on HBO so I don't need to buy it but I haven't bothered to rewatch any of them anyway.  Unlike BOB which I have watched and rewatched several times.

Executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and others who were responsible for BAND OF BROTHERS, THE PACIFIC is, without question, a companion piece to that earlier acclaimed HBO mini-series.

Perhaps the major difference between the two ten-part series, aside from the fact that one takes place in the European theater of World War II and the other is set in the Pacific, is that BAND OF BROTHERS deals with a company of soldiers, whereas THE PACIFIC centers on only three Marines.  We, as viewers, are therefore more able to narrow our focus and understand the harrowing emotional struggles that these Marines experience.

Like with BAND OF BROTHERS, the many battle sequences in this show are extremely realistic, violent and horrifying, as are the post-battle scenes.  They may have been the enemy, but seeing the bodies of hundreds of mutilated, dead Japanese on the beach the morning after a nights-long firefight is very appalling.

We, of couse, mourn the dead in THE PACIFIC, but this film compels us to equally mourn the loss of humanity suffered by the survivors, such as Eugene Sledge, a sensitive young man from Alabama who, by war's end, has become a brutal killing machine.

Interestingly, the two most emotionally involving one-hour episodes of the series are #3 (""Melbourne"") and #10 (""Home""), neither of which feature battle sequences.  In the first one, the Marines from Guadalcanal are sent to Australia for a rest and one of them, Robert Leckie, becomes involved in a romantic relationship that the lady ends because she fears he will be killed.  In the final episode, the men return home after the war and try to adjust to civilian life.  Both of these episodes are extremely touching.

THE PACIFIC is a magnificent epic production, beautifully written and directed, and filled with haunting images and memorable performances by a cast of, for the most part, unknown players.  It is also a production that people who shy away from extremely violent films should avoid.

A sixth disc in the handsomely boxed set contains the following extras:

PROFILES OF THE PACIFIC contains several 10 minute featurettes about the real characters portrayed in the mini-series, including interviews with many of them and their family members.

MAKING THE PACIFIC is a 20+ minute ""Behind the Scenes"" documentary that includes interviews with Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and several of the key actors.

ANATOMY OF THE PACIFIC WAR is a 10-minute featurette that includes newsreel footage and interviews with scholars, who give a historical perspective to the Pacific war.

1168931,5,6305837325,"To start this off, I am 18 years old, so my views may differ from some of the other reviewers out there. With that being said, I love anything that has to do with World War 2. I first saw Band of Brothers a few months ago, and I loved it. It had great special effects, and it just made you feel like you were there with the soldiers, suffering, and fighting for your lives.

  When The Pacific came out, I just had to get my hands on it. I don't know why a lot of you are saying that it is better than Band of Brothers because in my opinion, I thoroughly enjoyed The Pacific more. It seemed like it had more character development which got you really attached to the characters and made it devastating when you had to see one of them die. Not only that, but having to see how they had changed when they got back. In the case of Eugene Sledge, at the beginning of the series he is full of life and just wants to go to war. At the end of the series he is completely changed, and that just broke my heart how he no longer seemed to care about much.

  One other thing that is just amazing about this series is that it doesn't just concentrate on the war parts (the parts that I was originally watching for), but it also shows the characters relationships outside of the Marines. A good example of this was Robert Leckie who found happiness in Australia only to have it taken away.

  There is no shortage of bravery and loyalty in this series either. John Basilone who received the Medal of Honor was then sent home to help sell war bonds. He first liked the attention, but soon he no longer liked everyone knowing him, and realized he may have made a mistake leaving his comrades during the war.

  So if it were up to me, I would have every high school showing this to their students. Its a very emotional and heart touching series that shows just how cruel war is. And believe it or not, it even got me to further research the characters involved in the story and find more information on all of this. Now imagine that, a series that can get an 18 year old to study American History. Good job Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg.",1287619200,25,2124,4.191646191646192
1168932,3,6305837325,"Reviewing the series as a whole and taking into account the very real limitations of time and money I can say unequivocally EVERY scene with Joseph Mazzello as Eugene Sledge is unwatchable. Likewise Part 3 and majority of Part 8 directed by Jeremy Podeswa are so ""Grey's Anatomy"" bad it's shocking Spielberg allowed his name in the credits, even as just an Executive Producer. For the record there are some VERY redeemable parts, specifically Part 2 and the last few minutes of Part 8 both directed by David Nutter and featuring Jon Seda as John Basilone, but for me, for the most part the series as a whole just didn't work.

One unavoidable reason is the well known fact that the Pacific theater was NOT romantic and therefore will always be a challenge in-and-of-itself to make entertaining. The Japanese (with good reason) were not seen as human and there is NO glory in slaughtering dogs. Also, what few women that make it into the series are so one dimensional and cliche for such a high profile project it's no surprise that the director of their parts (Podeswa) plays for the other team.

Ultimately the weak female performances and/or directing limitations of Podeswa and the weak performance of Joseph Mazzello as Eugene Sledge made for a grade too steep to climb.

Of interesting note I think if part 2 was released as a stand alone film about Basilone's Medal of Honer actions at Guadalcanal it would be regarded as one of the most entertaining and visceral battle sequences ever put on film.

Then I began trying to base the series on its own, without trying to follow in its brothers footsteps.  I was still disappointed.  The series just didn't seem to make much sense.  Characters would come and go and it was very hard to figure out who was who and who was doing what.  I didn't understand why an entire episode had been devoted to love/relationships.  I was just all in all disappointed and couldn't figure out why with a 200 million dollar budget The Pacific was made the way it was.

Months later I watched it again.  I love it.  Having the knowledge of who the characters are and being able to go into the series knowing who is who and where they are made it very enjoyable.  I understand now why they made the creative decisions to take some time to show the marines outside of the fighting.  It's still not Band of Brothers, but then again it wouldn't, and shouldn't, be.

1168954,5,6305837325,"The Pacific was an excellet tribute to the men who fought in the Pacific.  It is based on 2 books of 2 men who the series centers around... Sledge and Leckie (I am currently reading Sledge's, ""with the old breed"").  For anyone that compares this to Band of Brothers, there is a lot more background drama here.  Here you see families and loved ones.  What you aren't seeing is what jungle warfare did to these men.  You can't recreate 115 degree weather in a movie and expect the viewer to understand.  Plus, the psychological affects these men went through is only touched upon.  Imagine being the first wave of marines on Guadalcanal and then the navy pulls out, without resupplying food, water, ammo, etc, and then being left to fight the enemy.

Overall, it is an excellent movie and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.  My only suggestion for someone who hasn't seen this yet... don't start watching it with any expectations from Band of Brothers.  It was a different war and this was a different story.

1168955,5,6305837325,"A war movie stands or falls on it ability to portray the thousand-yard stare. It's that look that a soldier will have after only a couple of days of continuous combat, that shellshocked gaze that stares into an infinity beyond the horrific reality that they have endured and must endure again, and again.

The young Marines that are sent Guadalcanal, many on their first combat mission, are pumped up for action, giddy with the fantasy of the battle to come and with that peculiar sprit de corps that only the American Marine can conjure.  As the reality of battle settles in, their faces reflect some nameless contradiction.  Disturbing beyond measure is not only the sudden, irrational death of their comrades, but the fanatical pursuit of death by their enemy. It strikes the Marine as appallingly unnatural that Japanese soldiers would fling themselves into the face of relentless machine gun defenses whose end can only be certain death.

The camera fixes on the faces of the battle weary Marine as he contemplates such otherworldly moments that seem to last forever, then on a sea of corpses that was the night's work.  The faces look familiar, not because we recognize the actors (in many cases, we aren't likely to) but because we know them from photographs of war correspondents.  Yes, I would say that HBO nails the thousand-yard stare down pretty well.

The Pacific is an ideal series for home theatre viewing.  With front projection or sizeable flat screens and a serious high-definition surround sound system we are transported, safely, into a world that few of us now living ever knew, even if our fathers did.  There is much to learn - in many instances, to learn all over again.  There is comment in the Extra Features that - rather unwittingly, I should think - warns against the tyranny of a colonial power whose manifesto is the domination of lesser peoples.

Taken at face value, the drama that is the lives of Bob Leckie, John Basilone and Gene Sledge as they played their part in that great war is powerful stuff.  As with Band of Brothers, cliche is rare (after all, war is a cliche of sorts, is it not), sentimentality is left at the door altogether.  Bombs really do burst in the air and we are their victims as are they.

As for the high definition part of the package: The Pacific looks great and will likely become a benchmark for sound reproduction.",1287273600,7,2378,4.740291262135922

comparable. Not even close. This is pure rubbish with graphic sex scenes that add no value to the series. The series protrays the marines in a very
very negative manner and it is an insult to those who fought and died in the Pacific campaigns. The acting isn't good so it is hard to connect to the
characters, plus it jumps around to much. I purchased Band of Brothers to watch whenever I want to, but this mess is something I won't buy or watch ever again.",1287273600,27,745,4.445255474452555
1168957,4,6305837325,"It's been a few months since the final episode of The Pacific miniseries on HBO aired.  I watched all 10 episodes this spring and thoroughly loved them all.  Some were better than others, as is always the case, but as a series, it's right up there with Band of Brothers (2001).  Of course I have to give slightly better marks to Band of Brothers, which is simply one of the best miniseries ever created in my opinion...other than Lonesome Dove (1989), which was my favorite until Band of Brothers.  I think Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, as Producers on both The Pacific and Band of Brothers series, simply understand how to tell great war stories.  Spielberg started this war movie/story fascination of his with his film Empire of the Sun (1987), which I consider to be one of his best movies and the best movie performance in Christian Bale's career.  He continued his powerful war story development with his Oscar-winning film Schindler's List (1993), which to this day is a movie that haunts me and that I can only watch very rarely due to the dark horrors it shows.  And finally the trifecta hit with Saving Private Ryan (1998), which in my opinion was robbed of its Best Picture Oscar, even though I do think Shakespeare in Love (1998) was a terrific movie that year as well.

The Pacific was beautifully shot and the production design is outstanding.  The cinematography and editing are top notch.  There was never a doubt in my mind that what I was seeing on the screen was what was probably seen by my Grandfather and the thousands of other soldiers who fought WWII in the Pacific.  My Grandfather was shot on Iwo Jima early in that battle and took his stories from his WWII experience to his grave.  He never really shared that part of his life with his son (my Uncle) or his family.  But watching The Pacific, I feel like I have a small sense of what he must have experienced.

What's so interesting to me about this miniseries is the way the episodes unravelled the stories of the 3 main characters.  Some of the episodes were basically just love stories and others were mostly battle scenes filled with death and horror.  But it was all weaved together so wonderfully.  And I was surprised at how I found myself losing track of the time as I watched and got in the shoes of the characters.  I have to say that my favorite episode was actually number 8 entitled ""Iwo Jima"".  And while it has some battle scenes, it's mainly the story of one man meeting this woman he falls in love with and marries.  I just escaped into that episode and was left wanting more at the end.

I recently got the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer for this series and it is fantastic! If you like original movie scores, this is one of the best.  Zimmer is definitely my favorite modern movie music composer and he lives up to his incredible body of work with this soundtrack.  I have a feeling I will be revising my Top10 Soundtrack list to include this one at #10 instead of The Insider, which is hard to do...but The Pacific is simply Top10 worthy in my opinion for music scores, so I have to make room somewhere!",1286236800,5,3097,4.491071428571429
1168958,5,6305837325,"I agree with the other reviews in that you cannot compare BOB with ""The Pacific"". BOB was about the army in Europe,""The Pacific"" is about the marines in that corner of the world. Pacific, well was very close to the books written on GSGT John Basilone, and ""The Old Breed"" by Eugene Sledge, and "" Helmet for my Pillow"" by Robert Leckie. The statement on cohesion? Where the hell is that coming from? I grew up military, then served myself when I was an adult. Military life tends to lead itself to thoughts somewhat helter skelter. People who survived combat will also tell you the same thing, because this is how life is in the service of your country, pretty much one battle after another, and all that your waiting for is the day your enlistment is up and you go back to ""the world"". Then we you come back, things are not the same as when you left, and the friends you had who never went into the military have no reference for any of your experiences.

The last sequence, where all the surviving marines go home, is probably one of the most poinant of the entire series, especially when Eugene Sledge and Sidney Phillips discuss about the subject of why did they come home without a scratch while others gave it all, or came home maimed. The sequence when Eugene goes hunting with his father, and just stops and breaks down in tears....what more could be so real?

I honestly wish my father had gotten the chance to see this before he passed away. I wish everyone could see it, just as it is uncut and as real as it gets. Maybe then people wouldn't be so quick to want to send young soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines into combat.

I applaud both Steve Spielberg and Tom Hanks for this special, to me it only solidifies what I already knew, that my father's generation, truly was the greatest, and I thank God I was raised by a man who had been there.",1285718400,7,1858,4.395348837209302

Anyone who has read Sledge's book (one of the two main books used as a basis for the series) knows that a lot of the ""racist"" things shown in the series actually happened. American soldiers hated the Japanese and did some pretty horrific things to them throughout the war, as Japanese did some horrific things to US boys.
Some people who have reviewed on here act as if any soldier who has ever fought for the US is a certified saint, and is incapable of doing such atrocities. They would rather we be fed the same propaganda films the country got in the 1940's then to watch a series for historical and entertainment purposes.

1168960,4,6305837325,"Much has been said about the difference between BoB & The Pacific mini-series'. Obviously BoB had the perfect start up where the series began with training. This allowed the viewer to 'get-to-meet' the cast of real life characters close up. This is essential in any series - the viewers have to connect with the characters. The Pacific writers obviously chose not to do that this time and introduced us to the cast in a drip feed method in between battles. This put the series on the back foot as we didn't really know who we were losing - due to little heart connection.

As for the battles themselves - The Pacific theatre was unique. Unlike Europe, where Patton could attack, meet resistance, shift direction, force a hole, outflank, breakthrough and fan out - in the Pacific, most of these battle tactics counted for zip. There were few lulls in the battle, precious little cover and an intensely humid tropical environment - it was no holds barred kill or be killed until every enemy was eliminated. Where US Forces retreated and regrouped in the Battle of the Bulge, the US Marines & Army could only retreat into the sea.

And the enemy was vastly different. Where the German soldier was exceptionally tactical & clinical...the Japanese trooper was fanatical. There has been plenty written about their battle code so I won't repeat it here. The Clint Eastwood film ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" best describes the Japanese experience from a personal level.

I recommend you watch this series without all the distracting ads and see it as a good visual history lesson. Hopefully it'll be our last World War!",1284854400,11,1606,4.811594202898551
1168961,3,6305837325,"It's clear that war is a brutal and horrible thing. I am just not sure that it's a good use of my entertainment time to watch soldier after soldier stare off into the distance and see how he's clearly dehumanized as a result of war, emotionally scarred and likely to do something reflective as such on screen.

Not to mention that the pacing is really strange (Melbourne ep, Lecky recuperating etc...), I actually found myself fast forwarding (PVR) on multiple occasions to get to something interesting.

I loved Band of Brothers but this is a shadow of that effort.",1283731200,9,566,4.707070707070707
1168962,5,6305837325,"This review is a response to the several alarming reviews that claim this series is inaccurate and that the violence of American marines towards the Japanese has been exaggerated or flat out made up.  Anyone who is making these claims has not studied the Pacific theater of World War II.  It was extremely violent and racism played a huge part in motivating that violence on both sides.  Any veteran of this war will tell you this. E.B. Sledge says as much in his book ""With the Old Breed"", one of the books this series is based on.  Entire books are based on the racial aspect of this part of the war:  ""War Without Mercy"" to name one.  To try and sanitize the Pacific war and turn it into a clear-cut black-and-white good vs. evil interpretation is an insult to everyone who fought there.  Some also claim that Japanese atrocities are covered up by this series.  Not true.  In the very first episode we see American bodies disrespectfully mutilated by the Japanese.  On Okinawa we see the Japanese use civilians as shields or suicide bombers in their attacks.  The goal of the makers of this series was to explore what war can make good people do, and the price they pay for fighting it.  The series is excellent in that respect.",1283731200,49,1231,4.545454545454546
1168980,5,6305837325,"The Pacific is a much more artistic and fuller told story than Band of Brothers. The acting, writing, photography and direction of The Pacific are all superior. The difference is in the details. For example, the view of one of the main characters lying dead on Iwo Jima slowly pans back to show the many other Marines also lying dead or wounded there. When another scene shows another one of the main characters getting off a train, it also shows another Marine with his right arm missing walking close behind him. Perhaps the acting is better partly because the story focuses on only a few Marines during and after the war whereas you never really get to know any of the characters in depth in Band of Brothers. Everything really comes together in the tenth and last episode showing how various Marines adapted differently to civilian life after they return home. One vows to never wear his uniform again while another wears his to impress (and later marry) the girl across the street. The creators of The Pacific take their time to finish their story in this last episode and accordingly they leave a fine lasting impression of this masterpiece.",1283558400,4,1147,4.74
1168981,3,6305837325,"Band of Brothers was one of the greatest shows on TV so naturally, when HBO announced the Pacific (the other theater of operation), I was looking forward to it.

Here it is in a nutshell.  BOB: 5 stars. Pacific 3.5 stars.  The biggest difference in the two series was that with BOB, the focus did not waver from Easy Company.  That allowed me to build a connection with the characters in BOB.  With the Pacific, the actual war was a scattered island-to-island, frog on a lillypad operation.  Combined that with three different protagonists, I found the storyline and the characters too scattered.  I wanted to like the Pacific a lot but the magic of BOB wasn't there for this series.

On its own merit, it is a very good series and a must watch for any history/war movie buffs.

By the way, I don't get the negative reviews from others who apparently see the Pacific as a liberal/leftist attack on American military honor.  I have no idea why you would see it that way.  War is hell.  Atrocities are committed on both sides.  It just so happened that the Japanese perspective was not represented.  There is one memorable scene where one of the ""less compassionate"" US marine is tossing debris into a pool of blood that accumulated in a Japanese soldier's half destroyed cranium.  Having watched that scene, I certainly did not think that ""boy, those US marines were savages"".  What I sensed from that scene was how the chaos and the destruction of war also destroy one's humanity (not just Americans or Japanese).

Apparently tea party activism is rearing its head in Amazon reviews now.",1283472000,19,1587,4.692028985507246
1168982,2,6305837325,"While there is definitely much to admire when it comes to The Pacific -- great battle sequences, solid acting, great special effects, etc. -- it suffers from an acute lack of CONTEXT. In all the episodes, we never really get a sense of what the men are fighting for, why they are there, etc. While I guess that's true-to-form for the soldier in the ground, it doesn't help us, the viewer, understand what is for many a lesser known theatre of the Second World War.

For instance, why were they on Peliliu? A quick Wikipedia search discovers the island was needed for an airfield. Did you know John Basilone won the Navy Cross for his actions on Iwo Jima -- dramatically illustrated in Episode 8. How exciting it would have been were a post-script included to explain this fact, rather than requiring us to rely on Wikipedia.

This isn't helped by a very poor view of the Japanese as combat adversaries -- when the reality was quite different. My understanding of the Pacific war as formed by research during the Second World War is that American troops were often demoralized fighting the Japanese because they never gave themselves up and often planted booby traps and hid themselves to attack American units from behind. This is touched on during The Pacific, but there's never a sense of foreboding, of dread that around each turn or every corner, there lurked a potential enemy waiting to ambush them. In many ways, the Japanese are presented as pop-up villains, similar to that found in a video game. They pop up, get killed and action moves on to the next group. Perhaps this was the case, but the U.S. suffered 10,000 casualties on Peliliu (did you know that?) so I somehow doubt that was the case. Indeed, it was only after watching the series that research revealed Peliliu was one of the bloodiest and most controversial battles for the Marine Corps in WWII. Did you?

Both my points are illustrated during one sequence in Episode 7, when Eugene's mortar company sets up near a bunker which is thought to be abandoned. They discover that it is not, in fact, empty when Japanese begin firing. However, the way the episode is filmed and action proceeds, there's no tension. Considering the presentation by the Japanese prerviously, did you really believe he was in any danger whatsoever when charged by a katana-wielding soldier? If so, your suspension of disbelief is greater than mine.

While many have commented that it's unfair to compare Band of Brothers with The Pacific, I think it's a fair subject considering that many of the same producers and directors were involved in both efforts. Band of Brothers, however, is a far-superior series because it does try to establish context, there's narrative and we feel we can really come to know and care about the characters. And there is very real tension, even if you know the outcome. Watch the series and tell me you don't feel tense during the bombardments near Bastogne? Or that you don't feel the war weariness of Capt. Winters after he shoots the young German soldier?

True, The Pacific attempts to reach this level of empathy -- Eugene's confrontation with a Japanese samurai, for instance. But soon after, he announces he hopes the Japanese don't surrender so he can kill all of them (???). Was anybody looking over the script here?

Overall, I did enjoy The Pacific but was extremely disappointed that such a hyped-up and interesting project fell so short of what it could have been. While I feel like I learned something about American soldiers during the Second World War in Europe, my understanding of the conflict in the Pacific is still short of reality. And this series does nothing to remedy that.",1283472000,35,3675,4.7795275590551185

It showed how things could never be the same for a small town boy, even things he had once enjoyed. One of the most powerful scenes was Eugene going to a job fair and his anger at a girl who was obviously clueless about what he and his comrades had suffered. Nobody really knew what they had gone through and I think even today we at home are largely uncomprehending of what our men and women in the military experience in combat.

It was meant to give the feeling of what it might have been like to have actually been there, something you will not get from any history lesson.  And it succeeds in accomplishing this better than any other production about the Pacific theatre in WWII has ever done.  It follows three Marines through their service in the Pacific to the experience of returning home and trying to adjust to life after the war.  And, truth to be told, it is in fact history, it is just not the kind of history most people are used to.  It goes far deeper than the date and place type of dry history many folks may be used to.  Some folks complain about errors in the story, but I defy anyone to find a non-fiction work anywhere that does not contain some inacuracies.  No one is infalable, and no work is perfect.

It seems that a lot of people were offended by the racist elements in this series, and seem to even believe that those sentiments did not exist.  The racism was in fact there, and was strong on both sides.  Posters made by the war department actually depicted the Japanese as being monstrous creatures with fangs.  This is a fact.  Oddly, some of these folks seem to have racist leanings of their own and perhaps are offended because it touches a nerve that they do not have the courage to admit exists.

Basically, THE PACIFIC felt like it was produced in a very quick manner. I can somewhat understand the reason the story feeling rushed which basically comes down to the fact they had to condense five (5) years worth of war into a finite amount of shows. Whereas, Band of Brothers focused on the inception of the 506th PIR in 1943 and finishing in 1945.

In addition, because the movie felt rushed the viewer may not feel the same connection to the characters like you did in Band of Brothers. I found the book THE PACIFIC to be the only way I could connect to the characters and it was beneficial to read that along with watching the mini-series.

The special effects felt just like that... special effects. There were certain times where the effects looked real but on a whole it looked a little too CGI'ed and lacked the authenticity of Band of Brothers. I also understand it's hard to recreate a war scene with authentic tanks used by the Japanese and maybe that's why the movie looked it had too much CGI for being shot on location or very close to the same locations where the battles took place.

As for the historical accuracy I completely enjoyed the mini-series. It definitely brought everything I had learned about the War in the Pacific into perspective. I have watched many movies about the War in the Pacific and none of them gave you a great feeling for the real fight the United States Navy and Marines fought.",1282348800,3,1589,4.548951048951049

The difference was that Captain Winters and his men were around to provide guidance and direction and realism to the Band of Brother mini-series. The Pacific was based on three different eyewitness memoirs but no living vets. Hugh Ambrose served as a consultant but he lacks the skills or integrity of his father.

Maybe the problem lies just there: after Band of Brothers, you'd expect at least the same quality with The Pacific. Unfortunately, Spielberg and Hanks failed to privide the goods. They tried to combine a more personal touch, by showing the characters with their families and added a few sex scenes.  This didn't raise the quality of The Pacific.  It's true that Band of Brothers didn't show any family background scenes with its main characters, but that didn't prevent from Band of Brothers to be one of the best mini-series ever, if not THE best. If you already invest so much money, efforts and time in a mini-series(overfour years), how is it possible to STILL produce a dud?

Pitty it didn't have a script that was of the same value.

In fact it failed badly in so many ways that I have no interest in buying the set, regardless of collecting War Movies in general.

Comparison with Band of Brothers is unavoidable and also highlights its failiure. In BoB it is Easy Company that is the true central character of the show. We get to know Easy through its fighting men, but the story has a fixed background that we can associate with and character development is easy to follow. In the end you almost feel as part of the unit. In HBO Pacific no paticular unit is followed and instead we get a summary of the Pacific Campaign seen through various (and certainly variously interesting) characters. This means we do not get to follow the same characters all through except in a disjointed way. So all through the show I never felt becoming a part of anything.

Then the show does something amazing. It seems to try to cater to everyone? We have episdoes which almost have no place in a War drama like Episode 3 where the brave marines spend an entire episode trying to invade Australian Women. Worse the focus becomes entirely devoted to a single rather boring character, melhancoly and depressed. At the time the show uses this paticular characters memoirs as a base but really if Episode 3 hadn't been there it not only would not have been missed but probably would have been a better show, or better if it had been crammed into 10 minutes before getting back into action. But it was Episode 4 that almost killed all interest in the show for me. Having already suffered from watching Episode 3 then Episode 4 started out o.k. with action at Cape Gloucester where the main enemy is the jungle itself. 10 minutes in and I had forgiven Episode 3. But then the script writers flushed a good start down the toilet and we get to follow our melhancoly lover Lechie to a field hospital where he spends the rest of the Episode in a mental ward in his customary depressed way. Imagine watching BoB and the Bastonge Episodes had focused on Buck recovering from an arse wound rather than what happend in Bastonge and you wouldn't be far off. After being subjected to Episodes 3 and 4 the series start to focus on a new character and even if there was more action to follow the series failed to engage me from then on. Episode 8 is called Iwo Jima, except it has almost no Iwo Jima but again is focusing on some love drama. Boy.

High production value and a sad script make this a watcher but hardly a collectable and if you never see it, it is no great loss.

The DVD release of the Pacific bears my highest recommendation simply because the show is unrelenting in it's depiction of a very unrelenting Pacific theatre of WWII. James Badge Dale turns in one of the finest performances I have ever seen on television alongside Eugene ""Sledgehammer"" Sledge and the unforgettable, milestone psychopathic performance of Remi Malik as ""Snaffu.""

INTENSE... experience"".  His relief at finally finding that single word - finally free to pull away from the nightmares and resume his story - communicated volumes more to me than any mere adjective.

Very few units (never mind individuals) survived the entire Pacific war intact, and those who did can rarely afford to tell us much about it.  Thus, in lieu of a single narrative, the producers of ""The Pacific"" instead pieced together three stories which, taken together, span the experience of the 1st Marine Division throughout World War Two.  Leckie and Basilone's accounts cover Guadalcanal, Gloucester and leave in Australia while Sledge's account describes Peleliu and Okinawa, with flashes from Basilone describing life stateside and the landing at Iwo Jima.

Several negative early reviews suggest to me that understanding the brilliance of this miniseries requires patience.  Indeed, upon a first viewing, ""The Pacific"" may appear muddled and disjointed as it forcibly juxtaposes three very different story lines at contradictory moments of dramatic inertia.  There are two critical reasons for this.

One problem for the first five episodes is a matter of source material.  It is important to remember that ""The Pacific"" covers FOUR YEARS of warfare while ""Band of Brothers"" covers only one.  For veterans, the memory of earlier battles (such as Okinawa) tends to get obliterated by the searing intensity of late battles (such as Okinawa).  It would be much like trying to recall memories from childhood: you have isolated but extremely vivid scenes etched in your mind, but there is little rhyme or reason connecting them.  However, your more recent memories, especially when they are so wrenching, can be recalled almost to the day.

The second problem is that of recognizing characters, a issue shared by ""Band of Brothers"". Many scenes appear to read as, ""Some random guy in a helmet tells us this and that"".  These ""guys in a helmet"" are not only hard to identify in their combat gear, but also answer to a bewildering variety of names, nicknames, ranks and even rank slang.  However, as those who've come to admire the once nameless likes of Hoobler and Shifty from ""Band of Brothers"" can attest, none of these helmeted figures are as anonymous as they seem, and as viewers go back and review these once random snippets they will discover a wonderfully rich tapestry of personalities that teaches us how the barbarism of war affected these people and their relationships to each other.

No one demonstrates this growth better than Joe Mazzello (""Timmmy"" from Jurassic Park), who's slight frame evolves Eugene Sledge from a kindly, quiet kid to a bitterly angry vet.  James B. Dale may lack the confrontational ""bad boy"" edge that Robert Leckie's character seems to call for, but his powerful innate decency radiates a layered and humane interpretation that's endlessly watchable.  The inner life of John Basilone is not as well known, leaving actor Jon Seda little choice but to play him as a somewhat generic hero for fear of disrespecting a Medal of Honor winner by ascribing motivations that may appear less than courageous.  However, Seda is an excellent ensemble actor, most notably developing wonderful romantic chemistry with Annie Parisse in the calm before the storm of Iwo Jima.  This actress is just one of the many outstanding co-stars who create memorable sub-plots as they effortlessly perform the period dialog that seems to elude just about every other WWII production.

The music is also unusual and daring.  Hans Zimmer's New Age sensibilities construct a distinctly Japanese dissonance of bells that quietly envelopes the fury of battle with an unsettling form of Zen that never competes with or interrupts the urgency of combat - quite unlike the standard pounding action score or screeching horror effects that seek to heighten violence in other films.  Zimmer also proves he's perfectly capable of writing more conventional title music that evokes a gushingly American sense of honor without ever falling back on snare drum cliches.  His title music retains the ""Plaisir d'Amour"" quote (sung by nuns in an Ardennes convent) and will occasionally replay ""Band of Brothers"" in its entirety for those listening carefully to background music in certain dialogs.

There are, of course, nitpicks, which are inevitable in a project of such massive scope: Leckie's romance central to Part 3 never ignites, American mortars seem to be more accurate than baseballs (even on the first shot), starving, shell-shocked Japanese are somehow perkier and better dressed than fully supplied Marines (or even Okinawan civilians) and the hasty exposition to Part 1 is quite awkward (yes, it's true that that the nation was gloomy, but it's difficult to imagine ANYONE - especially Chesty Puller - assuming the Japanese were on the verge of world conquest barely 3 weeks after Pearl Harbor!)  With that said, for every little thing ""The Pacific"" might get wrong, there is SO much more it gets right that there is little doubt that this series is now the definitive recreation of the Pacific conflict.

The latter episodes of ""The Pacific"" are saturated with intense action and contain some of the most disturbing scenes ever put in a war film, once again reminding me of that conversation with the veteran: ""These are things that no human being can possibly deal with.  The only thing you can do is 'wall it out'.  Guys that couldn't wall it out - officers who were trained to cope by keeping things organized or artists who tried to cope by expressing themselves - these people simply couldn't handle it"".  Even this man's tremendous skills, inherited from a lifetime in the backwoods, were of no comfort.  As a member of an elite recon unit, the Japanese would deliberately let his unit pass then ambush the main body behind him.  The number of times that he literally walked *through* the gunsights of hundreds of enemies - each CHOOSING to spare his life - was only one of an endless list of profoundly disturbing things he had to ""wall out"" just to survive another day... not to mention another year.

To quote the series:
""You can't dwell on it.  You can't dwell on any of it"".

1169005,3,6305837325,"Wow, fishing out gold teeth, plenty historically accurate uses of the flamethrower but maybe a little overdone for some shock value, and all the other ""shocks"" that a modern American audience might be astonished by, who don't generally read history books, or any books like Americans used to, or even being taught anything other than politically corrected history through incorrect junk education in the schools without real history other than ""the american civil war was a war started to end slavery"" or ""america is a place to work and all the worlds citizens have american rights"", etc etc etc, or due to t.v./internet chat rooms/adolescent video games/cell phone entertainment, so what was lacking was the real historical other side accounts of Americans getting nasty nasties done to them in the course of war, like surrendered Americans tortured and killed in the usual manner, or found dead with bamboo through them when roped over pointy sharp/slant cut down bamboo that can grow a foot a day or more in the pacific, or hacked apart a limb at a time, I mean, you get the picture of ""take no prisoners unless there was a massive work to death project to be done"", there were plenty worse on the other side, including cannabalism of prisoners since the Japanese were quite often cut off from supplies and starving(Quadalcanal especially) and let me mention the burma railroad immortalized in ""Bridge over the River Quai"" which is the ""G"" rated version of what happened there.
This kind of reminds me of what one of my neighbor women said about a stray ferrel cat that was attacking and ripping apart all the neighbors's kittens and house cats and scratched up several neighbors including myself when we tried to catch it to take it to the pound, when the animal control officer came around and rounded it up with a loop and dropped it in a cage to be taken away, she cried ""Oh, that poor kitty"", ha, yeah right, poor wild unfeeling ripper indeed, oh, like the way ""poor"" WW2 Japanese Imperial Army soldiers are portrayed in this show alot of times.
Other than that, the old liberal ploy of portraying every soldier as permanently mentally ""damaged"" by military service, all military service from peacetime to wartime/paperpusher to greasemonkey or grunt, if you're a veteran like myself especially of a war then you are supposedly somebody folks need to maybe steer clear of in their so many words, so they/we can be eliminated as a credible voting block as is popular in modern times on t.v./movies/news reprorts was apparent in the nuthouse scene, I mean, very nicely done, I am surprised they didn't throw in some of the usual stuff like ""guns are bad and should be banned, etc etc nonsense"" or have a Bush Sr. charactor(who actually is a ww2 vet) receiving a straightjacket, I mean, it is surprising Lecke wasn't saying ""here Bush, I'll give you this pack of cigarettes before I leave, through the restraining cage""(wow, that would have been a liberal moment in history for sure).
This show, I enjoyed it of course, but not as much as Band of Brothers especially considering it jumped around so much I am still a little unable to recall the names of the big players, and I am glad it followed actual historical figures, it made me as uneasy like I said though, and not for the flame thrower incidents, cause I wished they would bring back the flame thrower for our soldiers in a big way.
My advice to others, even to myself, is to read more books on WW2 and the pacific theater.  Frankly, the ones I have read, even from ultra liberal sources, paint the Japanese Imperial Army as fanatical, bloodthirsty, deviant sadistic monsters, and definitely incompetent in military strategy(the repeated ""bonzai charge"" experienced through the war for instance) except later defensive strategies concerning fortifications.  Oh, but modern Japan still hunts wales AND dolphins for food, high price food of course, I suppose its a good thing China is stronger or their pandas would end up on modern japanese quisine as well, like panda sushi or something like that, but let us not forget the whales being hunted by them, still(yum yum?, I think not).
NO I WILL NOT PAY BUT ABOUT $35 OR LESS, FOR THIS SERIES ON DVD, I suspect it will go to about $40 in the next two years as a regular price which is probably when I will indeed purchase this along with blue ray BOB(having bought BOB as vhs, then standard dvd), probably haplesssly bundled to BOB, which will help me in the blue ray department by then.
I may not purchase this mini series at all, since I feel it was a hard slam against the WW2 American war effort in the Pacific, its definitely not on my ""must have"" list.  I am leaning pretty much toward the ""never will purchase"" side, a sentiment shared by several of my friends and several relatives, not just my humble opinion.",1277164800,6,4829,4.732779097387174
1169006,5,6305837325,"My wife and I had a somewhat hard time following the story at first - whether it be from us at first trying to compare it to the epic BOB or having 4 kids under 12 constantly interrupting us 40 times an hour. Regardless, it certainly isn't the series with the issues. I thought some of the parts overdone as when some troops go over to Australia and one of the major characters has a relationship while on leave - this is where historian buffs will balk. Most of what happened in Australia never happened from my research and understanding. Also, the way the series portrays Basilone towards the end. Since many of you are reading this for an informed decision, I will go no further - I am just one of those historian purists that enjoys factual data versus Hollywood's warping of the past. Many are minor in their scope overall however.

The character development and acting from everyone is well done and would risk to say some of the best I have seen in nearly every series. While it was initially harder for me to be drawn into these characters at first viewing for whatever the reasons, this series demands that I BUY it and give it a second to even a fifth look to capture all the subtle nuances that a series like this can provide. The CGI was completely undetectable from my unusually picky eyes as well.

i have a deep appreciation and respect for all the soldiers who have served, both alive and gone; thank you for your sacrifice and our freedom, God bless you all!

imho: i must say that overall i enjoyed bob more than the pacific, but this was a good show indeed.
good acting and production values. all-in-all, a nice companion piece to bob.

however, i do agree that there is a tendency in the pacific to show mostly marines who were on the breaking point; i mean where are the dick winters of the pacific, where are the Lt. Spears??
i realize that some other opinions will point out that this was based on the 3 marines; i get that.
i'm just saying that bob had a more balanced picture, where we saw those that were on the breaking point (Lt. Dike, Lt. Compton) and those that would lead by example (Capt. Winter & Lt. Spears),
and a bunch of others in between.
but in the pacific, it seems most of the troops were like Dike. i know there were many more like Basilone, but the show did not give them equal time.
instead the makers of the show found it more important to give us a heavy dose of the crazy ""snafu"".
i think if there was a ""snafu"" in bob, they would have given him a nice little blanket party a long time ago. i know i would have. i don't know how Sledgehammer put up with that jerk.
and i say these words because of the way it was portrayed on this show. i suspect in real life it may have been a bit differently. Sledge must have seen some redeeming qualities in that weirdo.
if most veterans can vouch that most marines were on the breaking point, as hanks and spielberg seem to indicate, then i stand corrected. but i doubt it to be so.

i shouldn't be surprised most marines in this show were portrayed the way they were; look at who made this show.
remember that bob was made in 2001, pre-Iraq and pre-BDS (Bush derangement syndrome)

for me, the best part of the pacific was John Basilone. i did not know anything about this genuine american hero.
i wept when Lena goes back to his parents house.
(BTW, why did they not show JB being killed by a mortar round, like it really happened, instead of the ""dramatic"" 2 shots to the chest?
all accounts i have read up on say that it was a mortar blast.)

praise God for men like John Basilone

As a World War II military historian, I praise the HBO mini-series, ""The Pacific"", for its production values and realism portrayed in battle.

However, as a former Navy man who fought in the Pacific in WWII, I believe the series might be better-titled ""The U.S. Marines in the Pacific"" because all branches of the Armed Forces participated in the historic Guadalcanal campaign.

In war's brutal scale of lives lost, consider this: After six months of toil, suffering and terror, the ground troops had 1,592 killed in action; U.S. Navy losses were 5,041 KIA (including Marine shipboard detachments); and several score of fliers from all services assigned to Air Solomons lost their lives.

1169009,5,6305837325,"As an owner of Band of Brothers, when I heard The Pacific was coming out, I was very excited.  Little did I know how much of an impact this series would leave with me.  It seems that with every war movie/series that comes out, the directors feel the need to up the ante on how graphic and gruesome they present the war.  I feel like they are probably getting closer and closer to the real thing.  I am in no way trying to say that watching it is getting closer to actually living it, but as a dramatic documentary of these events, this series is stunning.  The cinematography and sound editing are spectacular!  The acting is top-notch.  It's funny...it's actually hard to say how much I like or dislike this or that in a series like this, when the message is so hard hitting and heart wrenching.

Unlike BoB, we just follow three marines through their stories.  Two of the stories are taken from their own books; the third, from biographical accounts.  After several episodes, I was left utterly speechless at what was presented to me.  Long after the credits had rolled and the DVR reached the end of its recording, I was still sitting on my couch in silence, unable to contemplate what I just watched.  This series has left an impact on me.  I've always had a great appreciation for our military men and women.  Even more so now.  I ended up reading the books the series is based on.  With minor differences, small dramatic license, and some necessary independent interpretation of events/people...the series is true to what Robert Leckie and Eugene Sledge experienced.  This truly honors those who sacrificed everything that was asked of them...even their very lives.  And I am grateful that my generation will have this series as a means of remembering them.",1275609600,7,1763,4.6688311688311686
1169030,5,6305837325,"The realism in every battles, the brutality and fragile life had been long forgotten..
This miniseries from HBO and the production teams again demonstrated the seriousness of the production.

Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie no doubt were hero. However, many were captured in action such as (Glennie Frazier) and the civilian (Sascha Weinzheimer's Family) were placed in the camp at Philippine, they all demonstrated their heroic sacrifice till the the war ended.

My preference is to watch (The War) from Ken Burns and Lynn Novick first, then watch The Pacific to learn more about the greater generation, who had wrote their histories before us. Unfortunately, many are dying and their stories also buried with them.",1275436800,,716,5.217391304347826

I've read both of the books and have been immensely impressed that they were able to convey the feel of the books.

The reviews hitting it for ""having too much sex"" or the fact they don't like spielberg, should go watch disney films. They come here with an agenda and disrespect what veterans have done for this country for a religious and political agenda.",1275264000,5,558,4.636363636363637
1169033,5,6305837325,"Hanks and Spielberg have done it again!  The Pacific is a beautiful, haunting narrative about the experience of U.S. Marines in the pacific theater (PTO) during World War 2, presented with the gritty realism Hanks and Spielberg became famous for with their previous WW2 efforts, Saving Private Ryan (SPR) and Band of Brothers (BOB).

However, where SPR focused on the evaluation of life and death versus mission objectives and BOB focused on the evolution of brotherhood within a company's entire combat tour, The Pacific is unique in its focus on the emotional and psychological experience of the individual soldier and the incredible toll combat takes on the human soul.

I have not yet read the books on which The Pacific was based, ""Helmet for my Pillow"" and ""With the Old Breed at Peleliu and Okinawa"", written by two of the Marines who were the central characters and served in the campaigns presented in the miniseries, but those I know who have told me that the series captures the aura and the descriptions of combat life in those books perfectly. Of two vets of the PTO in my family (one Marine, one Army soldier), one said he was almost frightened by the realism of the sets and battle scenes in The Pacific, and the other said it ""brought back some tough memories.""

Personally, I found the Peleliu episodes (5-7) and the episodes on Okinawa and back home (9-10) to be five of the best hours of television I've ever watched.  The Okinawa episode is an amazing, gut wrenching climax to the series that leads perfectly into the struggles of returning home in an impressive, moving final episode.

How one cannot emerge from viewing all 10 episodes of this series without a new profound admiration for the U.S. Marines is beyond me.  They are heroes, one and all, and Hanks/Spielberg and the entire cast and crew have delivered a powerful and lasting commendation for their service and sacrifice.",1275091200,20,1905,4.825153374233129

To me, the most disappointing part of the whole thing was that I felt I lacked the sense of what really happened over there.  In Band of Brothers, you saw D-Day to the fall of Berlin, step by bloody step.  In Pacific, there were disjointed battle scenes, between all the scenes of R&R in Australia, psych-ward stays, military hospitals, etc.  Just a big, weird jumble.

1169037,3,6305837325,"I enjoyed bits and pieces of this mini-series and from my readings of E.B. Sledge and historians of the Pacific battles I thought it accurately portrayed the combat experiences of the Marines in that theater.  I found the brief strategic overviews narrarated by Hanks before each episode to be helpful, and I thought the combat scenes and the portrayal of the Marines' misery was well done, but on the whole I found the mini-series unsettling in a number of ways and I don't think I'd watch it again.

Most importantly, I feel the format of the series was disconnected.  In attempting to weave together the stories of three Marines who weren't necessarily fighting shoulder-to-shoulder, we get glimpses of each Marine and are then moved on to the next one.  The effect this had on me was such that I'd begin to care about one of them but would then be quickly shifted away to the next one.  So I found I really didn't care about any of the characters until E.B. Sledge heads off to combat, which is several episodes in.  Since I'd read his excellent book I'd already had an interest in seeing his story played out on screen, but when the story moved from Sledge and back to the States for a Basilone episode I found myself a little annoyed.  (To be fair the creators were moving through episodes chronologically so by default something like this is bound to happen, but in my opinion it did more to hurt the flow than help it.)

Compounding this I felt a number of the episodes really slowed the tempo of the series down (e.g., the leave in Australia episode, the Leckie convalescing episode, and most of the Basilone falling in love episode).  Here again we'd be thrust into one situation (intense combat) then rapidly shifted to an entirely different one (frolicking with Australian women), or vice versa.  I understand that the creators wanted to portray the experiences of these specific men, but just as I started to really feel cohesion amongst the fighting men in the jungles or beaches, we'd be thrown back into these individualized stories, which, again, I had trouble caring about.  Additionally, I think this format led to stilted dialogue since the characters themselves could never really find their groove within the series.  I often found myself tuning out of conversations because I just wasn't invested.

If one were to insist on comparing this series with 'Band of Brothers' I would say that 'The Pacific' lacked the cohesion of that series - mainly for the reason that in 'Band of Brothers' we followed one unit from the beginning of their war to the end of their war, which was geographically confined to a relatively small Europe; whereas in 'The Pacific' we more followed individual men across locations which were often separated by thousands of miles of ocean.  This geographic separation coupled with the constantly shifting protagonists/backdrops really threw me for a loop.

Finally, I am no wilting flower but parts of the series were about as grim as war movies get.  This is by no means a knock on the series - as I believe these scenes were accurately portrayed as the men wrote them - but it added to my general sense of discomfort.  I have only sympathy for the men who were asked to fight in those horrendous conditions, and to see this fighting portrayed on screen was powerful indeed.  I'm glad the creators undertook this effort to honor these men, and I'm glad I watched the series once to gain an appreciation of the veterans who fought in the Pacific; but mostly because of the cohesion issues mentioned above I'm not sure I'd want to view the series again.",1274659200,428,3597,4.728
1169038,2,6305837325,"Yes, BOB can't be topped, and therefore should not be compared with The Pacific.  Yes, the Pacific theater has never had a dedicated series like this.

But all in all, apart from some good action sequences (such as the Creek shootout in Guadalcanal), The Pacific is slow paced and doesn't do justice to the Japanese army in WWII.  In the series, the Japanese are portrayed as a disorganized band of soldiers who seem to be more eager to jump in the front of a machine gun than actually do warfare.

I also missed a storyline that I could follow -- although I consider myself to be pretty knowledgeable about WWII, many times I found myself trying to understand what was the mission at hand or what the soldiers were supposed to do next.  In BOB, I always knew what the soldiers had to accomplish in the episode, which made the show much more enjoyable.

On a final note, I guess I could do without the slow, love sequences such as the ones when the soldiers are stationed in Australia.

With wars raging in Iraq and Afghanistan as we approach Memorial Day, this series brought into focus our men and women in the military. Not only now and in WW II but in all the wars ever faught by Americans since this country was founded. But the focus of course was on our Marines in this theater of operations, The Pacific. the Marines faced a most ferocious enemy more so than the German juggernaut in Europe. The Japanese were ruthless and died without the indignity of surrender. Their hate for Americans and their code of never surrender made the battles for these Islands hell on Earth. The conditions that existed took many souls just from  disease alone. Its amazing that we prevailed! But then again the Japanese faced the US Marine Corp!! While the battles were a grim reminder of what these men endured I thought this would also be a good opportunity for the kids of today to understand the sacrifices that their grandpas made once upon a time, in both theaters of operation. It is also an educational opportunity as well. But above all it pays tribute to the best fighting force the world has ever seen and will see, the United States Marine Corp!  Semper Fi!!

I feel asleep several times watching episodes and had to rewind to see what I missed.  Two positive's is that the acting was excellent and the finale was very good.  I would say about 6 out of the 10 episodes were just bad and felt as if I was watching a poorly written soap opera.  That leaves us with 4 good hours out of 10 hours.  With names as Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg attached I was expecting a lot more.  I can't recommend this mini series to anyone unless you has time to kill and there is nothing else to watch.

While some of the battle scenes were good, several scenes just don't do a good job getting any point across.  The writers look to be trying to makes us feel that the Pacific theater was hell, mission accomplished.  Yes, the marines fought hard for nothing at times, with no purpose but to survive.  War is hell and loss of life is tragic and this series does get the point across, but with little entertainment or historical value.  Take 10 hours and read a good books about the Pacific war.  The sacrifice made by Marines for our freedom isn't given justice in this series.  I wanted to love this series, because the Pacific was really the United States War.  The US was attacked and had to defend itself.  The European theater was more about a madman that was given power by brainwashed citizens looking for simple solutions for their problems.  While just as important to America at the time, we had more help to fight the Germans than with the Japanese.  We fought most of the Pacific theater with little help from our allies.  Australia was already helping to fight the Nazis and could only offer limited troops.  China had no power and was no better than a militia.  Japan was hoping for a quick war with the US and anticipating that the US would back down to concentrate it resources to fight the Germans.  They didn't feel the US could fight 2 wars. Luckily, America was up for the challenge and the US prevailed.

Back to the series.  If you are going to watch this series be warned that it is long and jumps around to much.  You never really get a feel about the Pacific war except that it was brutal and effected the lives of many Americans.  This series is too much a soap opera and gives little in depth study of the war.  I feel the producers and writers were tying hard to show us a individual marine perspective, but they failed.  An episode or two devoted to troops under MacArthur command would have been nice.  With 10 hours you would hope to get some understanding of the Pacific war as we did with Bands of Brothers about the European theater.  Instead you are left with love lost and missing hope episodes.  Questions on why battles are fought are never addressed and sometimes the answer is there is no answer.  This series has too many incomplete story lines.  Almost every episode left me incomplete and unsatisfied.  A big disappointment.",1274486400,28,3016,4.473394495412844
1169051,2,6305837325,"In agreement with several other reviews on this series, I was sorely disappointed in TP.  I think we can all agree that it would be unfair to compare it to BoB in terms of story and cast, however, with the same backing as BoB it did have the potential to be as engaging.  While I found myself attached to a few of the episodes (Okinawa, Austrailia), I felt that the series lacked any sort of emotional consistency.  The characters, with exception to Basilogne, were disconnected and rarely present long enough for one to become fully immersed in the hell of the Pacific Theater.  Gene and Lucky were both great characters, yet the skipping around between stories was not as well threaded as was done in BoB.  The battle scenes were well shot and set, yet they lacked excitement and energy found in BoB.  My grandfather, and grandfather-in-law, were both Navy men--one of whom was a Pearl Harbor survivor.  Knowing the two of them, I know that every soldier in the War in the West has/had stories to tell--some hopeful, some otherwise.  TP just doesn't meet expectations and doesn't deserve a solid rating in my opinion.  Good filming, visually speaking, but technique doesn't make up for story in this series...If you want to see an engaging retelling of the Pacific, watch The Thin Red Line.",1274400000,23,1292,4.732142857142857
1169052,4,6305837325,"I thought that The Pacific was very well done. I've seen some pretty harsh criticism of the show, mostly claiming that there was a political agenda to the series. But color me naive; I didn't see a political agenda. I saw a miniseries that mostly took us through the hell that war was in the Pacific.

Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie were US Marines during the time period, and much of The Pacific is based on their  memoirs respectively titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/With-the-Old-Breed-At-Peleliu-and-Okinawa/dp/0891419063/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Helmet-for-My-Pillow-From-Parris-Island-to-the-Pacific/dp/0553593315/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Helmet for My Pillow: From Parris Island to the Pacific</a>. The miniseries tells the stories of the two authors and a third Marine named John Basilone. Basilone's story is apparently derived from the memoirs of a Marine that fought by his side during the war.

The battles in The Pacific are brutal and life on the battlefield and war ridden Pacific islands was, well, again...hell. The series gives you a realistic look at times of battle, and takes some liberties with various shenanigans that went on among the troops on and off the battlefield. It also touches on how one could be affected personally by the war experience and how it affects the families back home. Almost two full episodes are devoted to relationships: one by Leckie in an Australian fling and the other detailing how Basilone met and married Lena Mae Riggi, a Sergeant in the Marine Corps Women's Reserve.

But a tad morbidly I say that the real action--and what The Pacific portrays the best--is the ruthless battles that occurred in the Pacific regions during WWII. It is just amazing how brave the men were who enlisted in the service back during WWII knowing that if they were going to the frontlines, chances are that they weren't coming back. Hats off to them and thank you (the men and women today who go off to foreign lands to fight for America are of course just as brave...thanks to you too).

The Pacific for me was thoroughly entertaining. While perhaps not a classic, it had some scenes that will probably stay with me forever. I'm not sure that the price of the DVD or Blu Ray makes it worthy of collection, but do try to catch it on HBO on Demand or at minimum rent it....That is if you've got 10 hours to spare.",1274400000,14,2532,5.367758186397985
1169053,4,6305837325,"I thought it was a good series but it was not at the same level as Band of Brothers. This should have been called ""The Marines in the Pacific"" rather than just the Pacific because that is what was concentrated on. It was a good series though and definitely worth watching.

1169054,5,6305837325,"The Pacific is an impressive cinematographic masterpiece consisting of ten episodes (each is 45-70 minutes in length) chronicling the Pacific theater of World War II via separate but interwoven narrative threads centered on three real-life U.S. Marines (John Basilone, Robert Leckie and Eugene Sledge) who fought in five of the theater's major campaigns - Guadalcanal, Cape Gloucester, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.

The series begins with a 20-minute introduction to the three central characters in the U.S. just after Pearl Harbor, and ends with a 70-minute episode dealing with the difficulties of adjusting to life back home for two of the survivors.

After my first viewing of the series in HD on HBO, I gave the series a 4-star rating, docking it by one star for its sluggish development of the main characters and supporting cast in the first four episodes. However, after Sunday's series conclusion, I immediately watched all ten (recorded) episodes again over a few days and was surprised at how much more I enjoyed those first 4 episodes.  Knowing all of the characters so well with their stellar development (and phenomenal acting) in episodes 5-9 improved the connection with the characters in the early part of the series. Armed with this knowledge and familiarity, the second viewing allowed me to focus more on the situational awareness of the characters, the details of each episode, and the quality of the production. I just began my third viewing with episode 1, and the excellence of this miniseries is even more evident the third time through ... it is no doubt worthy of a 5-star rating.

I sympathize with the criticism of the slow and uneven character development early in the series, particularly from those who created expectations within themselves for a Band of Brothers repeat from Hanks and Spielberg. But The Pacific is most definitely not, and was never intended to be, a Band of Brothers with sandy beaches and coconut palms.

BoB was a feel-good war docudrama about a single unit of men who trained for two years together before setting off for 11 months of combat in a familiar environment with known geographies and topographies and relatively civilized rules of engagement with an enemy who shared a similar cultural background. BoB introduced us to the nuts and bolts of mid-century warfare -- training, tactics and leadership roles and conflicts are central to the tale, with combat situations far more important than the presence of violence itself. The objective of BoB was to give the viewer a positive, albeit solemn, bonding experience and sense of camraderie through a story with a logical beginning and a satisfactory ending, just like the historical account written by Stephen Ambrose on which the BoB production was based.

The Pacific, on the other hand, is a chronicle of the gutting of the human soul and the devolution of the human psyche that occurred with many soldiers in the pacific theater via the real-life stories of three Marines mentioned above who served in separate units and struggled to survive in a surreal hell for nearly three years of combat. The viewer is drawn into a violent orgy of brutal jungle combat and savage coral island assaults against an unfamiliar, ruthless enemy who knows no respect for life or civilized rules of engagement. Training, tactics and leadership are peripheral, at best, to the central tale of humanity's immersion into the fires of an incomprehensible hell. The objective of The Pacific is to assault the viewer's senses with spectacular introductory combat scenes followed by a steady, raw descent into horrific violence, leaving the viewer exhausted and disturbed before reintroducing him to civilization to catch his breath so the next descent into pacific hell leaves him even more fatigued. There is no satisfactory ending ... instead the viewer is left with the keen sense of struggle that a lifetime of nightmares will bring for the war's survivors.

Given these very different characteristics and divergent objectives, it is no surprise to me that viewers with prejudicial expectations of another BoB are left frustrated by their viewing experience of The Pacific, especially given the natural character development path of episode 1 in BoB versus the disjointed familiarization process with the characters of episodes 1-4 in The Pacific. Also, those accustomed to the small, squad-sized tactical perspective of combat so prevalent in Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers will be disappointed that this is not a focus of The Pacific.  Rather, The Pacific's modus operandi is to immerse the viewer into the confusing chaos of large-scale battle scenes, i.e. the approach to the beaches, the banzai charges in the jungle, the crossing of the airfield on Peleliu.

In terms of scope and scale, the weighty and meaty production of The Pacific exceeds quite handily the lofty, but relatively confined, tale of brotherly love presented in BoB. There is simply nothing in BoB, except perhaps for the concentration camp scenes in ""Why We Fight"", that comes close to achieving the visceral experiences of episodes 6, 7 and 9 of The Pacific. And the outstanding production quality becomes more evident with each viewing.

But The Pacific's greatest strength lies in its historical accuracy and the fact that the entire production is based on the real combat experiences and writings of three U.S. Marines who served in the campaigns and battles depicted in the series.  This makes The Pacific both an interwoven memoir of the Marines who served in the theater as well as a patriotic tribute to their honorable sacrifice and interminable courage.  Hanks and Spielberg have delivered the finest cinematic salute to the U.S. Marine Corps in World War 2 ever produced.

As for some of the more ridiculous criticisms I've read -- that The Pacific is too gratuitous with foul language for the World War 2 era; that the portrayal of immoral behavior and actions by U.S. Marines is unrealistic and ahistorical; and that the depiction of sex in a couple of the episodes is typically ""Hollywood"" and both graphic and gratuitous -- I only have the following response: Spend some time with Marine vets of World War 2 and ask them how it really was, or view the profiles and interviews of the actual Marines portrayed in the series on YouTube (all begin with the title ""The Pacific: Marines of the Pacific ...) . Read the books written by two of the characters in The Pacific whose work formed the basis for the production, ""With the Old Breed"" by Eugene Sledge and ""Helmet for My Pillow"" by Robert Leckie, to get a flavor for what their experience was really like. Marines really did swear a lot. Many of them were crude and callous human beings. Most of them drank gobs of alcohol. Nearly all of them became desensitized to violence and hatred and did in fact do horrible things to their Japanese enemies, dead and alive, as their souls were gutted by day upon day of brutal killing. And yes, they had plenty of sex whenever the opportunity was there ... sex was, is, and forever shall be a more important part of a soldier's life than it will ever be for a civilian's ... sex is a natural stress release. Sex feeds the positive side of the physical sensory ledger, offsetting the months of negative sensory experiences combat brings. And sex helps a soldier feel human again, and that is an integral part of The Pacific story.

I could not recommend The Pacific more highly. Just don't go into it expecting a comfortable viewing experience or a happy ending ...",1274227200,47,7553,4.969912905779889
1169055,4,6305837325,"The Pacific deserves Kudos for what it did right with the 10 part miniseries that just finished airing on HBO.  It started so strong with the fights at Guadancanal in episode 1 and 2. It focuses on 3 real life, well documented individuals, all completely different from each other. The realism was as incredible as HBOs other work in Band of Brothers. Though it dragged a bit in episode 3 and 4, the last few episodes were a triumph. The story of Eugene Sledge slowly losing his humanity and then trying to regain it that was incredibly poignant.  The last episode finished on a very high note and made me glad I stuck with the series .

The problems I had with ""The Pacific"" were few but loom rather large in some viewers minds (as in tuning out this amazing series). The swearing was pretty thick at times. I know that this is how it was at times but it kinda shocks grandma and grandpa and adds nothing to the story. The episode in Melbourne, Australia had tons of sex and nudity. Distracting to say the least, and very embarrassing. I know its weird that in this country, its OK to let my 13-14 year old see graphic war violence, but its NOT ok to let them see fairly graphic sex scenes. Why not let the viewer know what occurs discretely. Sex is not bad. The problem is that shows like BAND OF BROTHERS and THE PACIFIC are educational to the younger generation. You shouldnt have to be 17 or older to watch them. Just tone it down some.  By the way, im NOT a prude. Just  keep the tone of each episode consistent. Any family that missed the opening rating and warnings got a shock (raises hand--my face is still red--had 2 young nephews sitting there with me) Im sure im not the only one that happened to..

All in all, this is an amazing series and I feel sorry for anyone that decided to pass on those last few episodes. You missed the best parts. That kid from Jurassic Park, Joseph Mazzelo,  did a wonderful job as Eugene Sledge. His part ended up being even more powerful than Lt Winters in BoB since Eugene was more of an everyman and easily related to. The final episode was shocking in its emotional power and really gave me a sense of what the soldiers were feeling upon their return to civilian life. If you left it mid-episodes by all means jump back in. Its well worth the ride. I cant wait for the Blu Ray and DVD to be released. ""The Pacific""  still plays daily on HBO so its not too late to watch it.",1274227200,3,2420,4.303296703296703
1169056,4,6305837325,"I've read many of the reviews here and agree with some of the sentiments on both the pros and cons of the series.  However, I think the real payoff on this series is toward the end, and you need the patience to stick through some episodes which does to meander a bit.  'The Pacific' chooses to focus more on the human cost of the war than the 'Band of Brothers' series and perhaps because of that, some viewers may find it harder to watch some episodes, and others might find it lacks the stand-alone entertainment value that 'Band of Brothers' so skillfully delivered.  Ultimately it's the film-maker's challenge to balance the grueling realism of fighting marines in a difficult environment and making it entertaining for the masses, and I think it achieves that goal, though in a way different from 'Band of Brothers.'",1274227200,4,821,4.7272727272727275
1169057,5,6305837325,"I loved the Pacific. I found the action scenes remarkably believable and startling in their realism. Several of these scenes take place at night, which must have been very difficult to film. And yet what touched me the most was the incredible acting done by an ensemble cast of little known actors. The raw emotions our soldiers went through during and after the war were allowed to be showcased. The 10-Part Series had different directors for many of the Episodes. During Episode 3, which takes place in Melbourne, Australia, we are finally allowed to get close to several of the men. That Episode was like a movie within a movie. The direction was first rate, and the acting memorable. I found myself so involved with each episode, that the time flew by. And after just seeing the last installment, I was left hungry for more!

One thing that should be mentioned is that the three main characters of the mini series DID actually exist (in fact, several of the main characters were based on real soldiers). Two of them wrote excellent books on their experiences fighting in the war (available through Amazon). The third soldier won the Medal of Honor during fighting at Guadalcanal. He was ordered back to the States to help sell war bonds. Gradually, he felt so restless and guilty, he demanded to re-enlist, and be allowed to fight. He ended up fighting at Iwo Jima, and I'll leave it at that.

War is hell no matter where it is fought. But out in the far reaches of the Pacific during World War II, our soldiers went through something that they could not begin to describe adequately. And when they returned victorious from the Pacific, it was anticlimactic for most of the country.

My father was in the Army Air Force during the war, and was based in the Pacific. After the war, he stayed on in occupied Japan. He shared a lifetime of stories with me before he passed away 20 years ago. I wish he could have lived long enough to see this mini series. I would have to say that this project comes as close to perfect as I've ever seen. I can't recommend it highly enough.",1274227200,20,2075,4.557640750670242

Nothing I saw in TP compared to excellent portrayal of Major Winters by Damian Lewis from BoB. I just couldn't latch on to any of the characters.

1169080,5,6305837325,"As a former Marine this is about as real as it can get on movies. It is riveting lacking only the true fear of yourself actually being the target. Many that were in actual combat contributed to and were in such emotional circumstances that that they couldn't talk about their experiences but kept them locked inside their souls. Some times when these experiences were released they exploded. Pacific has captured this emotion although it will be disturbing for some to watch. I think Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks are to congratulated for showing that in a period of history common men and women never felt ""they deserved"" from their country but were willing to give all.",1274140800,10,672,4.801724137931035
1169081,5,6305837325,"I think part of the problem with people criticizing The Pacific has already been alluded to by other reviewers.  The PTO was a far different war than what was taking place in the European Theater of Operations.  As awful as ANY war is, the PTO was, essentially, a race war.  The Japanese and Americans had preconceived stereotypes, much of it the result of government indoctrination (reference the boot camp recruit who tells Basilone that he ""just wants to slap a Jap"") that inflamed their mutual hatred.

  Secondly, because the Japanese government had perverted the cultural code of Bushido, the Japanese soldiers felt it was:  preferable to die for their emperor rather than surrender; preferable to wire civilians (Okinawans) with explosives to kill Marines; preferable to use human shields; preferable to pretend to surrender or play possum in order to kill Marines.  This increased, by orders of magnitude, the sheer and utter hatred the Marines felt for their enemy.

  Third, the conditions under which the Marines fought were so dreadful that many Marines were shattered by the overbearing combined weight of the combat, weather, exhaustion, tropical diseases, and terrain.  In Sledge's book, his description of the heat on Peleliu and the mud on Okinawa almost drove him to madness.  Leckie's book makes a similar point regarding the incessant rain on Cape Gloucester.

  Thus, you do not see the same kind of comradeship among the Marines that we experienced in ""Band of Brothers.""  A good friend of my father's served from Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima and he acknowledged that you could detest the guy in your foxhole . . . but you'd still lay down your life for him; the frustrations often caused Marines to take out their anxieties on one another; this was characterized in the near fight between Sledge and Snafu during the Okinawa campaign.  Yet, Snafu, though an utterly amoral character, looked out for Sledge's well-being when he advised Sledge not to take the gold teeth from a dead Japanese soldier.  And this was not unknown in the ETO either; recall, from BOB, the chewing out Perconte gives to the gung-ho new recruit as Perconte tries to read his book in piece.

  I read one review on another site where an individual complained about the lack of ""brotherhood"" among the Marines and how they were always ""whining.""  Sorry to inform this individual that griping is one of the key prerogatives of the enlisted fighting infantryman . . . and with good reason.  In ""The Pacific,"" you need look no further for the brotherhood among warriors when Sledge comforts his buddy, on Peleliu, who is convinced that if he takes part in the assault, he's going to get hit.  In the book, he does; he gets a ""million dollar wound"" and happily gets shipped back to a hospital ship.

  But, personally, I need to look no further than my dad's old Marine friend who told me that ""The producers got it as right as they could for civilian consumption.  That's just about what it was like . . . except that they don't make quite as bad as it really was.  There was a lot more Marines out Jap trophy hunting than they show, and a lot more summary executions of the few Jap prisoners than they show.  One buddy of mine was taking two Jap prisoners back to the CP when he passed a chow line that was forming.  He took 'em behind a bush, let 'em have it, and got in line.""  His approval of ""The Pacific"" was all I needed to know that my original gut reaction to it was spot on.  Kudos to the producers, cast, and crew.",1274140800,12,3513,4.686274509803922
1169082,5,6305837325,"Any work, be it a poem, a book, a movie, or a TV series, should be evaluated for what it is, not for what it is not. So I suggest forgetting comparisons to ""Band of Brothers"" and let ""The Pacific"" stand alone, which it does very well. We Americans are so Eurocentric -- most of us are of European extraction -- that we know little of the Pacific side of WWII which, by the way, had been underway for almost two years before D-Day. The Army thought the Marines were condemned to anonymity in the vast reaches of the Pacific. Instead, from Guadalcanal to Okinawa, the Marines found eternal glory. They conducted one of the longest and most successful campaigns in all military history. They were the only branch of the U.S. military with the doctrine and the equipment to show up on an enemy beach, knock down the door, and take real estate away from the enemy. We know about the eight-day Battle of the Bulge because books and movies have been done on that topic. This series shows us the six-month campaign for Guadalcanal when the Marines were abandoned on a hostile shore by the US Navy; they had no George Patton to bail them out, all they had was each other. The series shows us how the Marines did one ""forcible entry"" after another as they marched toward the setting sun that was Japan. We see how inconsequential little postage stamp islands were sanctified by the blood of U.S. Marines. ""The Pacific"" shows us the Marine Corps heritage of valor that goes all the way back to Belleau Wood. Every American should thank God for the United States Marine Corps. This series shows us why.

Once I saw the first episode, I was mesmerized for the next 9 weeks! I scheduled everything on Sunday around watching ""The Pacific"".
Outstanding acting, incredible cinematography, great music score, realism that is scary! I'm running out of superlatives to use! It's not better, than BOB! It's just as good and just as heart warming, and gut wrenching as BOB. Both of these historical mini-series deserve equal credit. Don't let some of the reviews here influence your judgement not to watch it. Yes there are those that feel strongly about one or another, but I don't believe that was anyone's goal in making the Pacific. I believe, especially Tom Hanks, just has this compelling, passionate desire to put both theaters of WWII in the minds of both, those that served and those of us who have not. The mellow drama movies of post WWII lead many of us who did not serve, to think about WWII as a hero's time in history. I would never discount any heroics which there are plenty to be seen, It's just that both of these series, Band of Brothers, and The pacific, set the stage for us to all share in the reality of war. Some reviewers here have commented on how there feelings were evoked while watching, In a few words, I felt like I was there each week, and each week after watching an episode, I would look at there reality and think about my past week, good or bad and feel proud to be an American Citizen!

I'm an aging baby boomer, 64, and my Father, who is 88, and still with us, was a ambulance driver on the front lines in Germany, France, and a few other countries. My father also suffered from some of the mental duress from his time served. With this Memorial Day Holiday upon us very soon, I would like to say a very sincere, Thank You, to ALL who have served in ALL the wars that have helped make the United States of America a country I'm still proud of.

Mr. Spielberg, and Mr. Hanks, Please do what ever you can to bring more of these fine mini-series covering the Korean War, the Viet-Nam War, and both Iraq, and Afghanistan Wars. They deserve your serious passion, commitment, and wonderful talents! My Mother was an English WWar II Bride, so let's just say Hip, Hip, Hooray!

There is much more combat/violence in this series, but I didn't feel that that takes away from the story. That, being the infantry WAR in the Pacific. Get it? It's about what, again . . . ?

I also appreciated not having every nuance and detail explained for me. As when Basilone's wife appears in formal dress above the beach at the end of episode 8. Or the B-29 pass over at the end of episode 9. And anyone asking 'Where are they going?', needs to pick up a history book.

One thing that may have been changed is Tom Hanks's opening narrations. I know of many narrators that would have provided a much better presentation. Whether it was ego, or a way to save bucks, who knows?

And unlike a few here, I WILL be buying this DVD series.

1169088,4,6305837325,"The Pacific does a very good job of paying tribute to the men and women who served in the Pacific theater of war during World War 2. Every American should know the history of World War 2, and I believe this series should be a part of that learning process. There is a lot of attention to detail and historical fact that history buffs will appreciate, and the story is told well enough that the average person will understand why American leadership did everything they could to prevent an invasion of the Japanese mainland.

The Pacific follows elements of the United States Marine Corps 1st Marine Division across various battles in the Pacific, including Guadalcanal, New Guinea, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. In contrast to Band of Brothers, The Pacific emphasizes character development and spends a good deal of time on this. Since the two theaters of war were very different from each other, you cannot compare the two series accurately beyond that difference in story-telling.

The war with the Japanese was intensely psychological in large part due to the environmental conditions, and the Japanese Bushido Code that drove Japanese soldiers to accomplish their duties even by killing themselves in the process. The series does a good job showing the affect of this plus the overall affect of war on the sanity of the Marines. One will quickly understand why Marines did not take many Japanese prisoners of war. The series also does a good job portraying the extreme disadvantage of the Americans in some battles and leaves the viewer wondering how any Marine could have survived.

The biggest fault of the series, and the reason for the 4-star rating, is a personal opinion that less time could have been spent on character development while still telling the same story. There is about an episode-and-a-half worth of time that could have been stripped out of the series to provide more time expanding upon the battles. While the character development is extremely important, especially to showing the psychological impact, it was over-done in this series.

Short of that, this is a series that I will definitely be purchasing as it becomes available and will be recommending to friends.",1273622400,11,2196,4.975476839237057

1169100,4,6305837325,"The superb HBO Miniseries ""The Pacific"" is another remarkable collaborative production effort by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. It follows the US Marine Corps through the horrific World War II Pacific battles of Guadalcanal, Cape Gloucester, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.  Short interludes in Melbourne, Australia; Paris Island; and some stateside hometowns provide a jarring counterpoint to the battle scenes.

Comparisons with ""Band of Brothers"" are perhaps inevitable.  ""Band of Brothers"" had the advantage of following a single unit through the war, and was derived primarily from Stephen Ambrose's superb book of the same name.  The narrative thread of ""The Pacific"" is the experience of three individual Marines whose lives are reasonably well documented.  However, their stories overlap minimally, and the ensemble feel and continuity of ""Band of Brothers"" is lacking.  Perhaps in compensation, ""The Pacific"" is a gritty, violent, and painfully graphic presentation of what it was like to be a Marine in the Pacific war.

The three Marines featured in the miniseries are meant to be broadly representative of the Corps.  John Basilone is a pre-war Marine who wins the Medal of Honor at Guadalcanal, and is sent home to sell war bonds.  He will fight to return to duty, first as a trainer of new Marines, then as a leader of troops at Iwo Jima.  Robert Leckie joined up after Pearl Harbor and survived the fighting on Guadalcanal before being sent home for wounds suffered at Peleliu.  Eugene Sledge joined up a little later, held out by a medical condition, and would serve ""With the Old Breed"" at Peleliu and Okinawa, as his autobiography puts it.  He carries the narrative to the end of the war, in the mud and carnage of an Okinawan battlefield populated by large numbers of civilians as well as combatants.  A final episode captures the efforts of the survivors to reintegrate back into civilian life.

Each episode of ""The Pacific"" opens with a few remarks by surviving veterans and a voice-over narrative by Tom Hanks that connects the episodes.  Every effort appears to have been made to show authentic uniforms, weapons, and equipment.  The individual episodes run less than an hour, but they pack an emotional punch that should be plenty for all but the most hardened viewers.  ""The Pacific"" is highly recommended to those viewers who found ""Band of Brothers"" to be a worthwhile experience.",1273449600,34,2409,5.073604060913706
1169101,2,6305837325,"Mediocre acting, about 40 min of story per hour and too drastic hollywood rewrites of Sledge's real life experiences. With the fine book ""With The Old Breed"" to build on, I think they could have made a much better film.",1273449600,16,219,4.5
1169102,1,6305837325,"I don't know what has happened to Tom Hanks, but it is not good.  Perhaps too much Hollywood and too little real world.  I have been a Tom Hanks fan for years, so I expected this series to be as good as Band of Brothers, but it is not.  After seeing his interviews in which he plainly said that WWII was a battle against evil in Europe, but was a racist war in the Pacific, I really should have expected this anti-American garbage, but I was not prepared for it.  The torture of Japanese by American troops is depicted, while the atrocities of the Japanese done to our troops was ignored.

Tom, the war in the Pacific was not fought because of racism.
It was fought because of Pearl Harbor, which you chose to ignore in this series to promote your own anti-American bias.
And the men who fought were hero's, not sex-crazed racists as you portray.

I will never spend another cent on anything that Tom Hanks benefits from; he has now joined the ranks of Jane Fonda and other elitists who attack the nation that they were blessed to be born in.",1272844800,114,1042,4.345360824742268

Perhaps we got attached to the men of Easy Company so much that our expectations were too high but I found that the actors in Pacific were just that, actors. In BOB they were soldiers.  I did not see the sex scene and can not ""appreciate"" it's pertinence but it is part of life and sometimes part of a soldier's experience (yes even in WWII).  What I find odd is that it seems perfectly acceptable to some to show graphic violence and totaly revolting to show graphic sex.  People often die from violence, rarely from sex.",1272499200,10,882,4.220238095238095
1169105,2,6305837325,"I've been talking a lot about this series a lot with friends and there is a really interesting point to discuss, as several other reviewers have already started to do. The way sex is depicted in it degrades it in so many ways.

We in this country tend to feel that violence is more acceptable for our youth to see than people ""making love."" I think that idea is completely backwards, and I am about the biggest action/war film fan around. But, for these types of films (Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, The Pacific - even Schindler's List while we're on the subject) there should perhaps be a different standard.

Yes, these films are made for and intended to be seen by adults; but they are also ""event"" films that generate huge attention and word of mouth, especially among the young. They are touted as being historically accurate and true. They are also without a doubt the perfect vehicles to introduce young people into the experiences of their forefathers. The patented ""Spielberg"" approach to this material is unbelievably effective at getting viewers to relate to and in some small way experience the individual reality of these world changing events. It practically forces you to get involved, to feel just a bit of what is was like for them, God forbid - to CARE about your country's history and those that made it.

I for one, feel that Saving Private Ryan should be viewed by young people when they are emotionally ready for the violence but, even more importantly, for the CONTEXT of the horrible violence. They should be able to understand WHY those young boys are enduring that hell and fighting and dying. Romantic views of WWII aside, young people should understand not so much what the country was fighting for, but for what it was fighting AGAINST. I feel the same is true of Band of Brothers. But, to me, even the quick sex scene at the end of Band of Brothers is gratuitous and unncessary in it's depiction. It makes one give pause when considering showing the scene or episode to young people. That's unfortunate because they should be able to see it in it's entirety.

Here's why. Yes, in WWII the soldiers (like all soldiers) had sex. In Europe, a lot of them had a lot if sex especially at that stage of the war (Spring 1945). It is history, truth, honesty, the human condition, whatever you want to call it. Soldiers have sex. There is a place for sex and love in these stories that should not be ignored or glossed over, but the ""style"" these productions use in depicting it is graphic and raw. It does feel ""cheap"" and gratuitous. It unavoidably bursts open the door to a whole different conversation that parents might not feel young people are ready for. It could be depicted so much more ""tastefully"" and it would be a non-issue. The adults would understand what was happening. Younger viewers would either miss it or ignore it, or at least not be confronted with it so shockingly, and the matter would be over. By giving the viewers scenes of raw graphic sex, the producers force thoughtful adults to second-guess showing these otherwise masterful historic and cultural truths to the young people who are the ones most desperately in need to learn about and remember them.

This is ESPECIALLY true of The Pacific. It fails to develop the characters to any degree of emotional resonance. It fails to give a concise yet explanatory view of the ""Big Picture"" of context of the events. Worst of all, it cheapens the experiences and sacrifices of millions of Americans (and their Allies) by diverting attention from the World Changing endeavors they embarked upon, and the staggering endurance and bravery they exhibited, to repeatedly show them in lurid sexual situations.

I, for one, am VERY disappointed in it.",1272326400,23,3741,4.730061349693251
1169106,5,6305837325,"I have seen the first 6 episodes of the Pacific and it is always quite tempting to compare it to Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan. Judge it on its own merit. Like most of us, we have been attracted to the European Theater because Hitler and the Nazi's make such classic Hollywood bad guys. The Pacific Theater seems to of faded away beyond Pearl Harbor and Midway. ""The Pacific"" is s startling relevation of war at its worst. It not only depicts the savage cruelity war inflicts on the physical being but the mental damage that also incures. No one really ponders the fact that these men had to live with their memories the rest of their lives. These citizen soldiers were ordered to witness and commit terrible acts upon their fellow human beings. When the war was over, ""Just go home and pick up your former life and act like nothing happened"" seemed to be what society expected of them AND they did it. Never complaining. The Pacific really shows the aweful mental side of World War II. It challenges the sanitized perception of the so called ""good war"".  Civil War General William T Sherman said that ""War is Hell"". He never could of imagined what our Marines in WWII had to endure.

Thanks to these men, I have the luxury to sit in my comfortable recliner (now made in Mexico), watching my Japanese manufactered Samsung flat screen TV <---(How sad). WWI soldiers in both theaters of war (and the female homefront heros), gave us the freedoms we enjoy to this day. We who NEVER had to experience the hell and sacrifice that they experienced, owe them more then what we have allowed our society (and world) to have degenerated in to. They fought and died for our nation because they felt America was a nation worth dying for.  We should do no less. To me The Pacific has given me a great Nationalistic feeling of pride in not only honoring our European Band of Brothers but now honoring those Pacific Band of Brothers as well. Thank you WWII veterans for allowing me to grow up and live in a free society. I will not forget you.

PS. Thank you ALSO: Korean and Vietnam vets. Your sacrificies were NOT in vein! You too are honored patriots and heros.",1271980800,18,2160,4.516624040920716
1169107,5,6305837325,"****Spoiler Alert*****

This program follows 3 Marine heroes, their comrades and their sacrifice against a fearless enemy. You will feel every emotion as you watch this epic series. There are several scenes that will never leave your mind. This is an accurate depiction of combat in the Pacific theatre. Its very inhumane at times and not always easy to watch. Having said that-its something everyone should see, regardless of your interest in World War 2.  The level of detail and battle sequences are amazing. The amphibious landings and the hell thats thrown at these guys is unthinkable. The fact that the Pacific war isn't covered enough, makes this educational for some and intriguing to everyone. Thanks to Clint Eastwoods great movies(Letters From Iwo Jima, Flags Of Our Fathers) and Speilberg/Hanks -The Pacific, we are starting to get some great coverage in this area.  Of more importance, the men who gave so much are getting the recognition they deserve.

I have read some of the other reviews here and I can't understand the anti- reviews. This is not Band Of Brothers Part 2, its not trying to be that series. This series is much more personal. We get to see how bad the fighting was and how it changes these men. This series focuses on 3 marines, instead of a platoon of guys and their leaders.  Band Of Brothers is awesome, everyone knows that. BOB was also 8 years ago and its had its day in the sun. We all have it on dvd and will enjoy it the rest of our lives. I think some people have let the past 8 years of BOB marinate in their minds. Instead of coming into this series with an open mind, people were ready to pick it apart, because they love BOB so much. I think once this set comes out on blu ray and you can spend a weekend enjoying what a great series it is, you will see that it stands on its own. I heard one guy after the first episode say "" its slow, I hope it will pick up"" . The first episode of BOB was boot camp and getting ready for D-day- that was a slow episode, but very enjoyable- just like this episode one. But in this series the marines are already on Guadalcanal and the action has begun in earnest. Makes no sense.

One of many aspects I enjoy about The Pacific is the time the soldiers spend away from the battlefield. I think they do a great job showing whats on these guys minds, what they have to fight for and how their fate on the battlefield effects so many. Theres an episode where they are stationed in Australia and you can see how some Aussies can't wait for them to leave. While others fall in love with the soldiers or welcome them into their lives. Its a dynamic of war that is easier to cover in a series this long.

The Marines weren't just fighting a fearless, well trained enemy- they were fighting the jungle as well. Which is also well covered in the series. I can't imagine living in these conditions, let alone fighting the Japanese. The diseases and lack of proper supplies killed thousands of soldiers(on both sides), who didn't have the chance to decide their fate on the field.

The acting is well done by the 3 main performers portraying Basilone, Leckie and Sledge. The chemistry between Jon Seda(Basilone) and Annie Parrise(Lena) is hard to find. I thought the episode where they meet, fall in love , marry and seperate because of Basilone's Iwo Jima mission was one of the best in the series. It seemed like every episode was better than the previous. It kept getting better. There are many episodes and moments that make this great. The 3 episodes that encompass the Pelieu battle are intense, brutal and realistic for battle. I feel like the brutality and ruthless battle of the Pacific war is captured very well here. This warfare is much different from the European theatre. The Japanese won't surrender when the odds look grim like the Germans did countless times.  It gives the viewer an idea of how savage the fighting in the Pacific would have been. There is a scene where the Marines are trying to cross an airfield- but the Japanese are waiting and ready. The following moments are above what we have seen in Saving Private Ryan for graphic war violence. For a good while its unrelenting. Another moment that will stay with you is when Sledge is on Okinawa- the last battle. He enters a small shelter to find a crying baby. When he looks around he finds a woman close to death. She wants him to kill her to end her pain, even putting his gun to her head. But he is done killing. Its a powerful moment. There are good hearted moments to find too. The episode where the Marines are in Australia is great. And the final episode finds the soldiers trying to make a life for themselves in post war America. Several find love and begin fresh. Leckie(James Dale)who earler in Australia lost love, finds love with the woman he had been writing too throughout the war. Although he never sends the letters- figuring he wouldn't survive the war!  The people who made the Island sets should be given praise too. The battlefields are very realistic.

The special features are definatley worth your time. The first section covers several marines with profiles lasting around 10 minutes per marine. Some of the interviews are from several years ago, when they were still alive. Its priceless archival footage of our countries heroes. There is a making of ""The Pacific"" feature that covers all the research that went into making th sets and recreating the battles. Extremely impressive! This is top shelf film making here. The final section covers the reasons for the savagery of both sides in this war. As well as helping some to understand the conflicts of cultures.

I would recommend this series to anyone who has an interest in World War 2, film making, great story telling and those who like to feel the spectrum of emotions when watching something this good.",1271548800,821,5835,4.573205741626794

1169109,1,6305837325,"This series is supposedly based on the books by E.B. Sledge and Robert Leckie but evidently Hanks and Spielberg did not think that the sacrifices of the men in the Pacific were important enough ""to sell"" without adding lots of gratuitous sex, nudity, and language that was not typical of men of that era - see Andy Rooney's My War who claims that men in WWII did not use the ""F-word.""  That is not to say that some troops did not visit prostitutes or have affairs. However, the series cheapens the lives of men of deep faith, who are the main characters in the series. If you read Leckie and Sledge, you will find that the producers of the film fabricated parts of their lives merely to sell the series and make money for themselves.  Furthermore, such graphic sex does nothing to advance the story. It also robs young people of the opportunity to see an important part of U.S. History because this series, at best, should have an ""R"" rating and a strong warning to parents and teachers.
