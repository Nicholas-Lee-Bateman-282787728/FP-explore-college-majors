2345526,5,B000A0GYMS,"I saw this on PBS several years ago. It is the incredible story of how the subway system was built in just a few years.  It shows how our society has drifted backwards from the ""can do"" attitude of the early part of this century.
Today this would take 20 years of BS, followed by 20 years of building.  FIVE STARS",1196812800,44,313,4.114754098360656
2345527,5,B000A0GYMS,"I don't know what these other two reviewers were expecting but this is exactly what it says it is, the story of the building of the New York Subway. No it's not Ric Burns New York Documentary...why you thought it was is beyond me...this is an excellent documentary of the early years of the Subway system.",1171238400,52,305,4.464285714285714
2345528,1,B000A0GYMS,"This is not a 14 hour documentary about New York City, instead it is a 56 minute long documentary about how the old Electric Subway in NYC was built in 1900, as seen on public television and ""American Experience"".",1166745600,5,213,4.487179487179487

2345560,5,B000A0GYMS,Same rating as for Penn Station.  Great means to understand this amazing undertaking in the area of transportation.  Am giving it as a gift.,1397520000,4,140,4.791666666666667
2345561,1,B000A0GYMS,"This documentary often relies on very unpleasant devices apparently in order to make otherwise uninteresting material interesting. Picture this, if you can: a formal, nineteenth-century studio portrait of one of the subway engineers superimposed over motion pictures of the inside of a subway under construction. That is to say, both are visible over an extended period at the same time, so that you're either trying to view the subway movie through the face of the engineer, or trying to view the face of the engineer through the movie. Confusion and irritation, rather than engagement, is the effect produced. Over this is superimposed narration about the development of the subway, and over THAT is superimposed ragtime piano music--the jarring rhythms of which fight the rhythms of the spoken narration. After a half hour, I couldn't watch or listen to any more.

Although much detailed information from contemporary sources (newspapers, especially) is conveyed, the production seems amateurish. I'm surprised that American Experience, which has released such masterful documentaries, released any documentary produced to such standards.",1383264000,4,1141,5.595375722543353
2345562,3,B000A0GYMS,"For the price charged, I was expecting more.  I agree with the person who gave it 1 star rather than the people who gave it 5.  What the description for this movies says is what you will get so don't think this film will cover the entire subway system because it doesn't even come close.  The description mentioned the IRT line but do not be deceived into thinking this film covers the entire line because it does not come close.",1379462400,3,429,4.3375
2345563,5,B000A0GYMS,"I received the DVD on time and in fine condition, thank you. I really enjoyed the history of the NY train system, learned a lot.",1376784000,,128,4.16
2345564,5,B000A0GYMS,"""New York Underground"" is a documentary which covers the development of the New York subway system, from its origins through the construction of the IRT.

Presentation in this film is polished, and provides historic footage and imagery and expert discussion. The movie's one hour length was just about right. I found the pace just a tad slow, but not enough to give less than 5 stars. This documentary provides needed context, explaining the pressing need for improved transportation in New York in the early 1800s, and the dramatic effect the subway had on the city once it was installed. The two main subways covered are Beech's pneumatic subway and the IRT (later developments are encapsulated in relatively brief comments toward the end of the movie). One minor complaint: subways in other cities (Boston, London, etc.) were mentioned in passing, but it would have been interesting to get even a little more information on subways which preceded those in New York.",1376179200,3,968,5.05
2345565,5,B000A0GYMS,This dvd is probably one of the most accurate and detailed story of the building of the new york subway system. I saw the dvd on PBS and just had to have it.,1367193600,5,157,3.787878787878788
2345566,4,B000A0GYMS,This is a very good overview of the history of NYC's subway system.  I found it informative but not great.,1363046400,,106,4.3
2345567,5,B000A0GYMS,"I have ridden many miles on the BMT, IRT and the IND and wondered idly how these underground networks had come to be.  The system is now over a century old, a bit gritty and shopworn, but still carrying passengers in relative safety.  It was a seemingly impossible job to dig all those tunnels, to disrupt ground transportation for years, but it had to be done if New York City were to function and grow.  The city after the Civil War was confined on the southern third of Manhattan Island.  It was crowded with traffic to the point of strangulation.  Expansion was impossible.  It was absolutely necessary that travel go underground where it would be unaffected by automobiles and weather.  The blizzard of 1888 made that obvious, if the summer glut was not enough.

Building the subway was as big a project as the Great Wall of China or the Pyramid of Cheops.  This, then, is the story of the visionaries who took on the project and of the men who perished to make it happen.",1320105600,16,977,4.505681818181818
2345568,5,B000A0GYMS,"This hour-long episode of ""American Experience"" documents the planning and building of New York City's first subway route. With wonderful film clips, photographs, and illustrations from the era, along with commentary from authors and historians, it tells the story, first, of the original two-block-long experimental pneumatic tube railway, and then of the massive, four-year construction project that became the IRT, one of the world's earliest--and certainly the longest--electric subways. Including profiles of the men who made it happen and providing wonderful period details, this documentary offers a glimpse into a different time at a pleasant, bite-sized length for armchair historians. Recommended.",1267315200,12,707,6.00990099009901

8071353,4,B000A0GYMS,"It would appear that they seriously abreviated the original PBS TV version of this program,  which when it first appeared, took the history of the subway from its beginnings up to the present day.  Is there an equally interesting 'Part 2' out there somewhere,  with all the same narrators?  .... that's 'unavailable' now?.  I remember the tv video program of this show very well with a cover photo of a ""F train"" climbing towards the 'Smith & 9th"" station in modern day.  What happened to the complete film?  I feel cheated on this purchase.",1437004800,4,541,4.691489361702128
