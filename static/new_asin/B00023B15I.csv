The first movie ""Marisa"" seems like it was a school project gone bad that the students just crammed for. The second movie ""Haunted"" is  somewhat better but I agree with the other reviewer that it looks like a home movie and not in a good way. Definitely not of ""Blair Witch Project"" caliber.  The third movie ""His Life"" had a thought-provoking message but the  actors/actresses were sooo wrong for the parts . They looked  older than 20-somethings. I know it's a low-budget film but if they plan to sell it on DVD worldwide, the director/producers should have spent more money hiring age-appropriate actors to make the scenes more credible.",1189728000,2,778,4.6838235294117645
8021031,1,B00023B15I,"Ok, I must COMPLETELY agree with the other reviewer here. Words cannot express just how bad these films are. I'd rather watch a dog bite a flea ~ or a Bush speech than this. Dreadful indeed.",1189641600,,190,4.305555555555555
8021032,1,B00023B15I,"The box proclaims Jason Santo as an award winning director.  I can't imagine what awards would be bestowed upon someone producing this body of work.  These are, literally, home videos.  Literally, in the sense that are made by someone with a video camera, employing what must be friends to act.

Overall, the short films comprising the set are remarkably bad.  One, ""Haunted"" almost has something going for it and feels as though a group of moderately talented friends got together with an idea of a project but no means of executing it.  It is also so poorly acted it defies description.

Watching these produces that unfortunate feeling of ""I could do better than this"" which, of course, you probably could.  But it would still be garbage, and we don't need more of that.

I hope the director doesn't get to read this - and doubt he will, but really, this is some bad, bad stuff.",1110758400,8,881,4.632258064516129
