The latest DVD version has three different soundtracks, from terrible to almost acceptable. I am waiting and hoping for this Gaylord Perry version to be released in DVD.",1489104000,,263,5.261904761904762

7805785,5,6300215474,"Josef von Sternberg were ahead of its time in the twenties and thirties. The Docks of New York is intense like a film noir,
suspenseful like a crime and love drama. Bancroft as a ship stoker is sensational. The Docks itself a pure life. What else can I say?",1398124800,,257,4.26530612244898
7805786,5,6300215474,"The Docks of New York is a very underrated masterpiece directed by Josef von Sternberg; the casting was wonderfully done and the acting was thoroughly convincing. True, the story may be relatively simple but the acting is some of the best I've seen in quite a while! Betty Compson, George Bancroft and the others amazed me as they conveyed so much with their facial expressions; it all makes a simple story into something much more profound. Sternberg's use of lighting also helps so much to set the mood for the entire picture and the cinematography is exceptional. The choreography reflects great forethought and the musical score enhances the film.

When the action starts, the ship upon which Bill Roberts (George Bancroft) is a stoker docks in New York and the crew are given one night to have a little fun although they are warned by the ever-angry, cruel third engineer Andy (Mitchell Lewis) not to come back drunk especially because the ship must sail the very next morning. Bill goes to a nearby bar where he enjoys himself quite a bit but of course there are complications--Bill doesn't exactly get along with everyone at the bar! As Bill is returning to the ship, he sees suicidal Mae (Betty Compson) jump into the harbor to drown herself--she is a disillusioned prostitute who is not ""decent"" and she cannot find a way to redeem herself even if she truly wanted to.

Bill takes Mae to a nearby run-down apartment near the bar; it's also the same building in which engineer Andy has given his wife Lou (Olga Baclanova) ""the air."" Lou and one of the women running the bar tend to Mae and Bill finds some new, dry clothes for Mae. Mae and Bill go back to the bar, start talking and almost on a whim decide to get married then and there--they don't have a license to get married which greatly bothers the parson, Hymn Book Harry (Gustav von Seyffertitz).

It's also interesting to note how the wedding, a rather hopeful event even though it's impromptu and informal, takes place in a bar at the New York docks where people don't feel optimistic about the future. The bar patrons have fun and drink to forget their worries and pessimism for just a little while.

Although Bill and Mae marry they have problems ahead of them; but I'll stop here because I don't want to give away too many spoilers! I've already left out some of the plot so you'll enjoy this film as much as possible. Suffice it to say that the last fifteen or so minutes of the film have one or two plot twists that I didn't see coming.

The Docks of New York is an excellent silent film that I highly recommend for fans of Josef von Sternberg and the actors in the film. People who appreciate classic, poignant dramas will not be disappointed.",1354147200,,2717,4.582304526748971
7805787,5,6300215474,"Throughout the years, being myself mostly  a `30s-`50s classic-films buff, I've ""learned"" or have been able to watch, like and enjoy the Silents, and to recognise when a Silent Movie rises ""above"" the average (i.e.: ""Sunrise""), and this grim, realistic Von Sternberg picture surely does!

Before Josef Von Sternberg created the bizarre, sumptuous and decadent world in which his ""creation"" (Marlene Dietrich) ""breathed life"", in many films between 1930-1935, he made some GREAT films, also at Paramount Pictures, during the late Silent Period, among them ""Underworld"", ""The Last Command"", ""Thunderbolt"" and this one I'm reviewing.

Here, macho-man George Bancroft (excellent) plays a very rough stoker who wants to spend his only day on land, having fun, drinking at bars, surrounded by women of ""easy virtue"", but then he meets Betty Compson (I won't tell any further details about tho movie's plot, in order to not ""spoil things"") and his life changes...

Strong performances by all the cast, especially Bancroft, Compson and alluring russian actress (Olga) Baclanova, better known for her nasty role in the 1932 Tod Browning horror masterpiece, ""Freaks"".

The film's scenery, art direction, the sets, the ""mood"" are EXCELLENT, truly depicting the life in these ""Docks"" of New York.

A great movie by all accounts.",1094688000,4,1316,5.333333333333333
7805788,4,6300215474,"I can only echo what others have already said about this excellent silent movie made in 1928, when techniques and styles were well developed - only to be abruptly ended a year later when sound arrived.  So for anyone a bit reluctant about silent films, or simply new to them, then ""Docks of New York"" is a great place to start.  It is a simple yet touching story of true love in an unlikely setting:  the rough dockyard neighbourhood with its drunken barroom brawls and 'ladies of the night'.  It moves at a comfortable pace and takes in much visual detail, while building a certain suspense about what happens next,  making this film a real pleasure to watch.  Definitely worth having!",1086998400,6,686,4.628099173553719
7805789,3,6300215474,"Josef Von Sternberg was one of the great mis-en-scene directors of the silent/early talkie era.  In 1929, at the close of the silent era, Paramount commissioned him to direct George Bancroft in the murky ""Docks of New York"".  Frankly lost in audience's new love affair with ""sound"" movies, ""Docks"" is one of Sternberg's most visually successful films. Slow-moving and thoughtful, it's the story of grimy New York dock workers, and the on-and-off love affair of one couple.  Laced with heavy cigarette smoke, the camera dollies in out of dingy bars and dark waterfronts. Several scenes are still considered near classic for their moody ambience(including Bancroft's rescue of a woman's near-suicide on the docks). Promoted to stardom by Sternberg, George Bancroft's career would slowly fade out after this picture.  Ten years later, he was a supporting player in 1939's ""Stagecoach"".  ""Docks of New York"" is not an exciting picture, but cinema lovers here can relish the magnificent visual powers of Sternberg in his prime, just before he entered his popular 6-picture series with Marlene Dietrich.",1035417600,6,1097,5.281609195402299
7805790,5,6300215474,"You may never have heard of this silent film, but you will love it! A simple story is very well told with great acting, realistic atmosphere and great camera work. One of the best made films of the twenties!",945993600,3,207,4.333333333333333
