2747852,1,B000MTFFTA,"First of all, I'm going to put my dignity on the line and admit that I like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tail-Sting/dp/B00006L94C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tail Sting</a>&nbsp;to some degree, and have even watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deep-Shock/dp/B000A2X3O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deep Shock</a>&nbsp;a few times by choice. So when I say Stinger is one of the most piss-poor pieces of junk I've ever seen then, hopefully, my warning urging all to stay away will be heeded.

Not long ago I picked up&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Centipede/dp/B0009GX1UQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Centipede</a>, which was released by Maverick/CreepFX as well. It had its share of flaws, but in the world of low-budget creature features it was pretty good. So I decided to give Stinger a shot (for $3.74 total). I would say I wish I never had, but then I would not have the ability to give it the damaging review I now present. This movie seems to be virtually unknown, and I can honestly say it should remain in the void of obscurity. Do NOT salvage this title from the void by giving it a chance.

The pacing is terrible. There are long stretches of silence and people wandering around a cramped dark interior without the slightest hint of suspense. When people deliver their lines not only does it seem like they are reading them, but contemplating them as well. The abundant computer effects are the worst I've seen. I know a lot of reviewers say that about pretty much every low-budget creature feature that utilizes computer technology (even if it's really not that bad), but in this case the statement is 100% true. The scorpions look like shiny black CG balloon animals. The movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Glass-Trap/dp/B0009PVZSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Glass Trap</a>&nbsp;may come to one's mind, but the CG ants in that are leaps and bounds ahead of the scorpions on display in this dreck. On top of that, the scorpions constantly let out a generic recycled roar that everyone has heard before countless times. Don't even get me started on the digital sub and minisub.

If the movie wasn't bad enough, the DVD adds insult to injury. Many movies in this genre are made with home video in mind; therefore, when they receive a full frame transfer it is either the way in which it was shot, or at least manages to keep enough visual information in the cropped transfer to ensure it isn't too annoying. That is not the case with this movie (unless it had the worst DP in film history). Every shot looks cramped with visual information flowing way past the constraints of the image. There are reaction shots where only half of the person's face is in the frame, or not at all. One scene in particular comes to mind. A character is telling a story and the camera pans over to show someone next him, but instead of actually seeing that person the audience is left staring at a blank wall. It is an atrocious transfer.

Don't let the synopsis,  semi-neat cover art, or low price cloud your judgement as it did mine. The movie and presentation are all-around terrible.",1347062400,5,3256,5.4523809523809526
2747853,3,B000MTFFTA,"The film opens with some poorly done CG graphics of a submarine. These were not the worse CG graphics out there because they top it with their CG helicopter, mini sub, gun fire, and scorpions. The film has a high camp factor. If you are a fan of Asylum films for all the wrong reasons, this film is must see. The technical aspects of a navy nuclear sub are horribly wrong, far too many to detail. They could have at least had proper styled uniforms with appropriate insignias. And why does every movie scientist wear a white lab coat when they are never in a lab?

The story line was bad too. Giant Radioactive Scorpions get loose on a nuclear sub and kill everyone (almost). A crew of Marines and civilians in a mini sub hook up with the disabled sub resting at 500 feet. Dr. Carly Ryan (Michelle Meadows) is the civilian in charge of the operation. She keeps the fact that there are deadly giant radioactive scorpions on board a secret as it is classified and they don't have a need to know. Ellie Winters (Daniella Kimber) is the other female in the crew because Michelle won't take her top off. Lazlo (Jordi Almeida) is the geek civilian who is played as being border line autistic. He manages to get the sub's ventilation system working by cutting random wires and beating the unit violently to a pulp with a hammer.

The acting left much to be desired. The filler dialouge had excellent camp value. In fact I really hated for the plot to progress because the necessary plot dialouge was boring by comparison. There were a lot of dark scenes (as in lack of lighting) and plot continuity issues. At one point they decided not to bring back the deadly giant radioactive scorpions. The Navy doesn't want to salvage the sub, so what do they do? a) leave the hatch open when they leave and flood the boat. b) seal the sub and let the scorpions expire from an eventual lack of food and air. c) Decide to risk life and limb on a search and destroy mission in a submarine. The sound track was haphazard as they played foreboding ominous music at random times. The scorpions made noises that sounded like they lifted it from ""The Predator"" movie. Watch at your own risk.

8172082,1,B000MTFFTA,"Don't ask why I watched the entire movie.  This is one of the worst I have seen.  Just because you make a movie that is too dark to see much, doesn't make it a good movie.  The acting was atrochious and the ""scorpions"" were ridculous.  This is not worth watching and I don't know why I did.",1507420800,,290,4.035087719298246

8172084,2,B000MTFFTA,"Whelp... not very good. It had potential, though. Well, at least I thought so.

On presentation- it was TOO dark (most of the time) and the CGI appeared to have been done  by a novice.

On characters- the scientists and soldiers were 'angry' with each other, but no real explanation why.

On plot/set- hey, killer scorpions all over the boat, let's spread out, take naps, and find time for sex! Endless ammo too! And, let's make the sub corridors, etc., much bigger than reality.",1497657600,5,479,4.666666666666667

8172087,3,B000MTFFTA,"The movie has a good plot for an horror movie and the interaction of soldiers and female scientists is what you expect, not on good terms.  The monsters are very well done but you can't see them and some of the action because the movie is so dark in the corridors where the soldiers run into the Big Bad Monsters.  If you can deal with shots of flash lights moving around or people talking in the darkness then you will like this movie.
