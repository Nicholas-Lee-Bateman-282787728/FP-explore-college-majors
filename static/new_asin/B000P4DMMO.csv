Hsing-Yi is a martial art by itself. You do not need to learn anything before learning Hsing-Yi.
It might help to learn Karate or Tae Kwon Do. Most people go to work or go to school to earn a living and Hsing-Yi is very easy to learn.
Finding a school that teaches Hsing-Yi is difficult, but these are modern times you can learn from books and DVDs and find an instructor later.
If you cannot learn Karate or Tae kwon Do, Hsing-Yi is actually easier to learn than either of these martial arts. The simplicity of Hsing-Yi is the reason you will want to buy this dvd as a collector's item.
It is a true master piece.
Have fun learning Hsing-Yi my friends.
Best regards,
