2173774,5,B000679NLO,"I am a musician/collector of all genres of music and I can truley say that this is an incredible DVD.  I wasn't able to see S+G on this tour, so owning this DVD is a real treat.  It's hard to believe that it's been over 2 decades since they toured.  They sound like they've never been apart.  This concert showcases Simon and Garfunkel as both excellent singers/musicians.  They are also backed by an equally excellent band.  This is a must own DVD for any music fan.",1102464000,3,467,4.372093023255814
2173775,5,B000679NLO,"Simon and Garfunkel were the group that inspired me to pick up a guitar at the age of 10. Now at 23, I can still say they are one of my favorite groups, the other being the Beatles. I am eternally grateful for my father's influencing me to appreciate . . . no not only appreciate (that's an understatement if I ever wrote one) . . . for exposing me to the wonderful, intuitive, creative, and meaningful music of the 60's and 70's - what I recognize as true art and and not the commerical crap that riddles the radio these days.

Ever since I watched the Concert In Central Park for the first time, with my father, I knew Simon and Garfunkel were something special. They have such a beautiful melodic and harmonic style. Paul Simon is an intuitive songwriter. Garfunkel has a wonderful voice and is nothing but an asset to the duet. Neither of them would have made it without the other. Paul Simon inspired me to pick up the guitar at 10 years-old and I've been playing ever since. Simon and Garfunkel were the key inspiration in my being a musician, before any other group, and that is something I hold dear in my heart and is undoubtedly what augments my appreciation of them. Cheezy it may very well sound, but oh so true.

Now about the DVD! I think it's great that the Old Friends show is being released! I saw Simon and Garfunkel in Ft. Lauderdale at the Office Depot Center almost a year ago already, and they were amazing! They couldn't have selected a better list of songs to perform, and they performed them so well. 'The Boxer' is my personal favorite, a masterpiece in my opinion.

Simon and Garfunkel . . old friends, pop culture icons, legends . . . my first muse for playing and writing. Before them, there was no music in my life. Since I woke up to them, I've never been without their legacy.

If you appreciate beautiful melodies, wise words, and just good ol' 60's folk rock, this DVD is a must have!",1102291200,9,1918,4.379213483146067

2173808,5,B000679NLO,"If you are a Simon and Garfunkel fan this is one DVD you have to have. I never dreamed they could be better than the Central Park Concert but they were outstanding the night of this video and a concert I will enjoy for years to come. One other reveiwer described this concert as more of a rock sound than the folk sounds of the Central Park concert and I agree, couldn't say it any better, both are outstanding. So good to hear them sound so good all those years later, sure wish they'd give us another tour.",1441584000,,508,4.1938775510204085

2173812,5,B000679NLO,Great DVD. Artie seemed so engaged with the audience and he seemed to have a lot of warmth for them. I also thought it was cute how excited Artie got when the Everly Brothers came out. The grin on his face while performing with them was adorable. Scarborough Fair was my favorite. I especially love that they did Leaves That Are Green. If anyone hasn't seen this they need to. Its a great way to spend an evening.,1426550400,,413,4.3076923076923075

2173848,5,B000679NLO,"I have never gotten more good out of a DVD than this one. Not only do i love Simon and Garfunkel music, this concert video is nothing short of PERFECT regarding the song selections, performances, technical acoustics, everything one would like to have perfect when they listen. I have compared this video and concert to many of S&G's other performances, many of which are famous and excellent, such as Central Park, etc., but this one is the quintessential perfect iconic performance every fan should have in their collection. It is as if even S&G have finally honed their performances to where they really want each  song to be. Many of the best songs are even better here than the original studio performance, as concert performances can often be an enhanced version of the song, but this is without any annoying audience interruptions or awkward ad libs that sometimes destroy the otherwise perfect outcome. I can't even count how many times i have played this DVD......but many more to come.",1405209600,3,994,4.881656804733728

It's more intimate, and catching them at a point in their career where they still had the physical stamina to pull it off at a high level. And....drum roll....The Everly Brothers are part of the proceedings, performing alone and with S&G, who they influenced. I don't even know if the Everly Brothers perform together anymore.

2173870,3,B000679NLO,"My husband and I saw this concert when Simon and Garfunkel were in Grand Rapids (Michigan) at Van Andel arena.  I left there so excited, I've always loved these two but that concert was the best.  They sang so well and seemed happy to be there.  They actually interacted with the audience.  I wish that was the actual concert that was filmed.  The singing is still wonderful on this DVD, but there is none of the interacting with the viewers.  I felt Simon and Garfunkel seemed more uncomfortable with each other and most of their remarks just confirmed that they'd had problems.  I love Paul's singing, but he always seems so quiet and out of place in front of all those people that it makes me feel bad for him.",1360281600,,713,4.438461538461539

2173872,1,B000679NLO,I got this as a Christmas present for my dad only for him to find out that it didn't work on two different players.

2173873,5,B000679NLO,"Nicely done by Simon & Garfunkel. The problem is that Amazon.com and some of its partners sell the PAL version--a format not targeted to most US DVD/Blu-Ray devices. I have two high end Blu-Ray players, neither of which can read the DVD. Fortunately, my computer is fairly forgiving. Unless you have a DVD player that is designed for both PAL and NTSC formats, you may be unable to play this DVD.

Anyone born later will see why music meant so much to all of us.  But this DVD is not just nostalgia and historical testimony.  The quality and depth of the performances are extraordinary.  I watch it with tears in my eyes both for the heart behind who we all were and have become and for the artistic genius and spirit of Simon and Garfunkel, who helped define us for ourselves.",1348876800,,510,4.28125
2173888,5,B000679NLO,"I love this video!  I had seen it on Netflix and had to own it.  I think it is one of their best.  The orchestral accompaniment is superb.

2173891,5,B000679NLO,"I've been a fan of both singers for a long time and lately had been looking at old footage,Youtube interviews of them over the years and so wished to see them perform again. I found this DVD to be such a wonderful treat, the magic still there and the performances top notch. I agree they aged backwards while watching...Art's a little raspy at times, but at 61 or 62, still can belt it out. I also wish American Tune was recorded by both back then, it would have been another great hit like ""Bridge"" which still gives me goosebumps.

They have spoken and visited each other over the years, not performed, but I felt they were very comfortable and if you watched inteviews, although some spats were fierce, the love and affection they have for each other is always there. Age mellows and I'm glad they were able to do this DVD and concert.

Simon and Garfunkel are no exception to this,and on this tour to the delight of the audience,brought Don and Phil Everly along as guest artists,who despite getting on in years were in good voice,as were Paul and Art. Songs taken from over the years came one after the other,performed well with wonderful guitar playing from Paul Simon just as it was back in the sixties in London where i was lucky enough to see Paul and Art perform one night along with old friend Jackson C Frank,i became a fan that night and have stayed a fan to this day.

Simon's insistence on pseudo-improvisation on classic songs leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and though he's a fabulous songwriter/musician/singer, his attempt at singing ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" sealed the deal for me.

If you want classic Simon and Garfunkel, get the Concert in Central Park DVD.",1227916800,2,470,4.924050632911392

However, this whole concert seemed overly staged and forced compared to the Central Park Concert.  Central Park was a phenomenon; an amazing, one-time, convergence of time, place, atmosphere, attitude, spirit and incredible, incredibly beautiful music.  If you want to get both DVD's, great, but if you want definitive video evidence of S&G's greatness, Central Park will always be the one.",1215734400,4,648,5.333333333333333
2173921,5,B000679NLO,"Paul Simon wrote these songs years ago, and Art Garfunkel
gave them beauty and form in his singing.  At first that
would seem to be it.  We can just buy the original album.

But these artist continue to create these songs.  As mature
men, they bring a dimension to the songs that they could not
do when they were younger.

It is like the songs turned about and helped to develop the
songwriter and singer in turn.  There is an integrity and
beauty that is emerging.

They show us what the word artist means as a life's calling.",1211068800,6,527,4.316326530612245
2173922,4,B000679NLO,"Perhaps universities around the world could adopt this DVD as a study in body language. As wonderful as the music is, it is often overshadowed by Paul Simon's dour and disinterested presence.  At times it seemed as if he couldn't put enough distance between himself and Art Garfunkel. And it is perhaps understandable since Garfunkel comes off as more than a little self-satisfied and show-bizzy.

But the music . . . it certainly says something about the strength and power of this music when it can still move you in spite of the palpable animosity of the singers (or at least one of them).

There is a refreshing lack of musical window dressing here . . . no army of backing vocalists and no horn section, just a top notch band playing tight, streamlined arrangements allowing plenty of space for the vocals to stand out. Jim Keltner (drums) and Pino Palladino (bass) are especially effective and sensitive, reproducing all of the iconic parts and still adding their own individual touch.

In spite of the on-stage drama, I still highly recommend the DVD to S&G fans and fans of music in general.",1203984000,4,1099,4.738219895287958
2173923,4,B000679NLO,"I saw the Central Park concert on PBS in the late eighties or early nineties (how time flies), but of coure I had heard their music for years on the radio, before they stopped playing anything older than 5 minutes (it seems). This DVD was excellent from a technical point of view, and it was certainly more enjoyable to watch as they were actually speaking to each other.  Their voices have deteriorated slightly with age, but they still put forth a remarkable show, and it was a refreshing change to see them show their idols and inspiration, the Everly Bros, the respect they felt they clearly deserved.  I feel the vocal quality of the Central Park concert is better for obvious reasons, but this is a good show nonetheless.  Whatever one may think of their eccentricities or social behavior (or lack therof), their music is indeed timeless, and this DVD is an excellent addition to anyone's music performance library.",1195257600,2,921,4.779874213836478

So when I watched this dvd, it wasn't impressed.  The Central Park concert was better in my opinion because, in general, they stuck to the original style of the songs.  The quality of the picture, along with the fact that they are much younger, is also better.",1168128000,2,406,4.233766233766234
2173939,5,B000679NLO,"I own this DVD as well as the Concert in the Park DVD; I was also at both concerts -- each had a different feel, and each DVD has a different feel.  Several reviewers have compared the two DVDs and, like most of them, I prefer the ""Old Friends"" DVD, which isn't to say that the Central Park concert is not worth owning.

The sound quality of Old Friends is superior, but that may be a function of the venue as well as of the updated recording technology -- at an outdoor concert, some of the sound is lost to the open air, while at a place like Madison Square Garden the sound is contained by the venue, and thus feels richer.

Though Simon & Garfunkel were backed up by a band in both concerts, the Central Park concert is more folky, with a peaceful outdoor concert feel (which is exactly what it was).  The Old Friends concert, on the other hand, often seems to emphasize the rock aspect of ""Folk Rock,"" which is a nice change from the Simon & Garfunkel sound I'm used to hearing.  Its venue, better sound quality, and lighting effects, also give it more drama.  On a flatscreen TV with excellent sound, the Old Friends concert provides the richer experience.  My choice of which to watch, however, depends on my mood:  I was at the Central Park concert the day before my first day of highschool, so if I'm feeling nostalgic I'll watch the Park concert; if I want more of an energetic, arena feel, I'll watch Old Friends.

As far as I remember, the only song they did at the Garden that was cut from the DVD was the Everly Brothers' ""Let it Be Me.""  This isn't a big deal for me, though I'm sure some Everly Brothers fans aren't happy.

Other than this, there's little I can add to what's already been said about this DVD.",1150588800,86,1725,4.309597523219814
2173940,5,B000679NLO,"These guys are awesome together. Someone should be writing new material and throwing it at Simon & Garfunkel to get them back together making music that we can all enjoy as much as their old stuff.

If there is anyone today who can play, sing, enjoy, perform, or compose music as good as this, I want to know who it is. Being from New Zealand, we don't get many opportunities to listen to music like this. I could have bought it here for NZ$40, but I saw it at Amazon for US$15 so ordered it without even a preview. Wow! It's 1:00am over her and I've just finished watching and listening the whole concert through, it was an absolute blast.

If good music makes you smile, sing along, and punch the air with joy, then you must have this DVD. I hope Simon & Garfunkel read this review and it encourages them to start afresh, because the world needs them to keep on!",1148601600,9,864,4.294478527607362
2173941,5,B000679NLO,"I'll admit I wasn't around during the 60's. I wasn't here for the 70's either and Regan was just finishing up when I was born. That doesn't mean I can't appreciate good music when I hear, and in this case, see it as well. My tastes range from Bebop to Blues, Rock to Reggae, and pretty much all points in between.

I've held Paul Simon in the highest regard with the other musical geniuses of our time (Pete Townshend, Brian Wilson, Lennon & McCartney, etc.) but only recently has the duo attracted my serious interest.

I bought the ""Concert in Central Park"" on a whim after seeing a short clip on a forum I frequent and was enthralled with the tight production and high, though sometimes awkward, energy. True to my nature as a musical ""guru"" I set out to research all I could about the duo, learning of their beginning, the breakups, the animosity and so forth. By Central Park it seems much of the past was beginning to be just that, the past, and the future was starting to matter again.

By the time this concert rolls around the two have aged a good twenty years and have had that time to reconcile. I'm reminded of The Who in this regard, as only Townshend and Daltrey are left and share a similar history. Two old men and a guitar. Once the music starts flowing all personal problems and grudges seem to disappear. Indeed, Paul and Artie (as they refer to each other throughout the night) seem closer than they have been since arguably their first meeting in the 6th grade play, a story which they elaborate on rather humorously.

There are smiles in quanitity as well as a few sideways glances between the two old friends throughout the show and I tend to think the only uneasy vibes they put off come from the fact that they haven't PERFORMED together in quite some time. That's a rather different angle than not having TALKED to, or SEEN each other in that span of time. I hardly believe the last time they spoke was at the Grammys, or the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, whichever came first.

But anyway, the concert itself is spectacular covering an array of classics as well as some lesser known material for good measure and a few Simon-Solo tunes that ""would've made a good Simon and Garfunkel record"" in his own words. Paul himself is in fine form, gesticulating wildly when not playing his array of guitars and grooving with the beat all night. Artie seems beside himself for most of the show, clearly enjoying it more than any man should have a right to.

Standout performances (which are difficult to nail down in such a superb set) include ""I Am a Rock"" with a slightly slower tempo and different arrangement but nonetheless enjoyable. The beginning of the song is a little shaky, but tightens up at the second verse. ""Kathy's Song"" allows Art to shine vocally. The Everly Brothers even show up for a short set, recognized as the models for Simon and Garfunkel. The four share the stage for a rousing ""Bye Bye Love.""

""Homeward Bound"" recieves a wonderful treatment with a bit of an extended middle section allowing the members of the supporting band to solo. The band is comprised of some of the best musicians in the industry though nearly every camera shot of drummer Jim Kletner showed a completely blank face, almost disinterested face though his drumming was superb.

The second act opens with a montage of footage from various sources including Art's acting career and ""The Graduate,"" leading into ""Mrs. Robinson"" and a jazzy, perfect take on ""Slip Slidin' Away."" A few lesser-played numbers follow including a bouncy ""Keep the Customer Satisfied."" ""American Tune"" sets a new standard in concert performance.

It's difficult to tell where the concert ends, as it is comprised of two separate dates. (You can tell which concert you're at by Art's trademark vest, or lack thereof.) ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" seems to be the closer, and a hell of a closer at that. This is where I see the dissolvement of the duo's problems as they share a song that was traditionally Artie's. Though, Paul looks like he's trying to upstage Art with his solo second verse.

My greatest impression with this concert is how the two seem to age BACKWARDS as the night progresses. The show opens with two old men, thinning hair, wrinkles, and straining voices. By the time we reach ""Cecilia"" we're back in Central Park. It's a testament to the timelessness of the music that its originators can still capture, and even improve on the connection it makes, thirty, even forty years after the fact. ""Leaves that are Green"" sees a stage revival for the first time since the 60's and the show ends with the anthemic ""Feelin' Groovy"" featuring some ... odd instrumentation.

If the two men were at odds, or at the very least unconversational with each other we might have ended up with something akin to the Roth/Hagar Van Halen concerts of a few years back, in spirit anyway. It shows through the music on stage and the ambient, laid back atmosphere of the entire show that they still are, as the title implies ""Old Friends."" I see no reason why this DVD should be viewed as a farewell, or a swan song. With talks of a new studio project or more touring, the sky's the limit for these icons in the new milennium.

As long as Paul Simon can write songs and Art Garfunkel can sing they'll be our bridge over troubled waters.",1141084800,67,5320,4.600210970464135
2173942,5,B000679NLO,"Simon & Garfunkel doing a reunion tour was the last thing on most people's minds in late 2003, but sure enough, it happened. Artie and Paul, the poet and the one band, grabbed their guitars and headed back to the stage for the first time since their legendary Central Park concert in the early 1980s'. This turned out to be a once in a lifetime experience for many young fans, as this will probably be the last time the two ever share the stage again.

This dvd, ""Old Friends, Live On Stage"" was recorded in New York in late 2003. It truly is a great show. From the opening song, the wonderful, haunting ""Old Friends/Bookends"", you know you're in for a treat. As Simon & Garfunkel's music is low key and mellow, don't expect some flashy light shows and Vegas style arrangement. The environment is very relaxed and laid back. The performances are great, the standouts being ""America"", ""Bye Bye Love"" (done with the Everly Brothers), ""Scarborough Fair"", ""Mrs. Robinson"", ""My Little Town"", ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" and ""The 59th Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy). They also dust off some old gems like ""Kathy's Song"" and ""Leaves That Are Green"" which haven't been heard in years.

Paul & Art are in fine form vocally, they still have beautiful harmonies. As one reviewer pointed out, they seem a little uncomfortable, but you could hardly tell. They compliment each other like nothing ever happened between them. This a great dvd to have in your collection and I recommend getting the cd as well.",1135814400,10,1492,4.734615384615385
2173943,5,B000679NLO,"I pressed play on the DVD player and settled down in my couch full of sympathy for two 60 year old men who sounded great in the studio recordings that we all own on cds and LPs. Having seen 2 CSN DVDs before this, I knew vocal harmonies were one thing to get right in a studio, but doing it immaculately on stage was an enormous task.

S&G do it with enormous ease. How? How can two men, at this age, playing a live show, surrounded by thousands, with just a guitar on occasion...master the ups and downs of each melody with such precision it is unreal at times.

This is one of the best DVDs I have ever seen. Get a high quality headset or route it through a 5.1 system and this will blow you away. Listen to it again and again and watch as Art Garfunkely rises and falls in perfect pitch and in perfect time with Paul Simon.

Sheer genius captured on immaculate sound and well crafted video. Great technology and great performers...we ARE a blessed generation to have the best of both.",1133395200,21,987,4.267379679144385
2173944,4,B000679NLO,"Simon and Garfunkel in the 60's were one of the top acts in America.

Paul Simon is one of the great writers in the history of American folk music. His lyrics are known around the world and many of his songs are already classics.

Simon and Garfunkel still have chemistry or a magic if you will.

After breaking up 35 years ago, they are still popular enough to sell out large basketball arenas with fans.

Many of their best songs appear on this DVD. Before I viewed this DVD I thought maybe it would be a lot like the Central Park Concert they did in the early 80's.

This concert shows Simon & Garfunkel as the icons they were and still are. You hear them do Old Friends/Bookends, I am a Rock which has a slightly different arrangement, At the Zoo, America and an outstanding version of Kathy's Song.

They do a short set of songs with the Everly Brothers.

They go into Scarborough Fair, Homeward Bound and Sounds of Silence and several other songs by Paul Simon and Simon and Garfunkel.

An American Tune is one of the outstanding songs of the night, along with Bridge over troubled Water.

They end the concert with The Boxer and do Leaves that are green as an encore.

When I watch this I just cant help but to feel what a shame it is that they broke up so early.

You also find yourself wondering why they never recorded again after the break up.

This is an outstanding concert by two of the greatest singers in American history......................sit back and enjoy",1133222400,5,1477,4.449814126394052
2173945,5,B000679NLO,"What did you think of the Central Park concert? Did you think the energy was awfully odd at times? Think it seemed like the two principals really didn't want to be there with each other? Think S&G's harmony left something to be desired, compared to the old days? Think most of the arrangements of their classic tunes sounded as if they'd been forced through a ""Southern Cal/mock-jazz/lazy-swing"" processor, much to their detriment? Think the idiot racing on stage during ""Johnny Ace"" was by a long shot the concert's single most compelling moment?

Yeah, me too.

Which accounted in large part for my hesitation in picking up this ""Old Friends"" DVD. I figured, who needs more such disappointment from these two? Let it go.

But, it would appear I read just enough from fellow reviewers to make me think this show might be different. And boy is it.

All wrongs have been righted, and the result is an illumination of who these guys are and where they've been that could hardly be improved upon. Their voices, though clearly withered a bit by age, are nonetheless delightful from beginning to end. The band is unimpeachable. The arrangements are a sublime and frequently moving blend of the familiar and the better than familiar. Paul has dispensed with his wig, Artie's having so much fun it should be a crime, and the direction/production choices by the film crew always serve and never distract from this amazing concert.

Listen...forget that Central Park mediocrity. Give the lads a mulligan. Try this disc. Tap into what's going on between these two guys as you watch the show unfold. For god's sake, it's got a Theremin in it - what more do you need?",1131408000,19,1655,4.7727272727272725
2173946,5,B000679NLO,"Simon and Garfunkel seemed a little uncomfortable together, but they were generous with compliments to each other.  This was clearly a reunion concert as the opening song appropo to the ambiance, ""Old Friends"". The two have known each other since sixth grade.  And we were privy to some of their disagreements that finally culminated into a breakup.

Aah, the voices!
Art Garfunkel, although he has no rhythm, has a most beautiful voice, better than he ever sounded before.  It was mesmerizing to hear him sing ""Kathy' Song""  And of course, he owns ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"".  There is something unique in Paul Simons's voice that I always favor, but at times his singing wasn't as strong.

Fantastic musicians with an array of instruments
Credit has to go to this amazing group of musicians who at times played some strange instruments.  Memorable was a unique contraption that produced the most beautiful wailing sound during ""The Boxer"".

Note: With help from a reader, I am told the unique contraption was a theremin, one of the earliest fully electronic musical instrument.

Musical interpretations
What was refreshing about this concert was the choice of musical styles for some songs.  There was enough of a style for the audience/viewers to be comfortable singing along.  But for the most part many of the tunes were just like we treasured them.

Everly Brothers..WOW!
Simon and Garfunkel paid tribute to their influences, the Everly Brothers and the highlight was to share the stage with idols for ""Bye Bye Love"".  It was a short set, but worth it.  On Simon & Garfunkels early CD, they do a rendition of ""Bye Bye Love"" that is just awesome!

Song I didn't hear
With the usual array of classics, and some I had not heard, the song I would have loved to hear was ""Late in the Evening"".  All in all, this concert and production was fabulous.....Rizzo",1129507200,10,1861,4.857142857142857

They made them seem very 'current' without losing the 60's charm. You could tell that Paul still needs therapy, as he is not able to accept that these songs would not be as great without Artie's contribution. Personally if I had written them and sung them and played such a great guitar with my school days friend, I would be happy. But that's me.",1116374400,11,523,4.402061855670103
2173969,3,B000679NLO,"I've been a Simon And Garfunkel fan since early 80's. I was born in 1974, so I couldn't experience their music in the 60's and 70's, but my Dad used to play their records all the time, so I grew up listening to ""The Boxer"", ""The Sounds Of Silence"", ""A Most Peculiar Man"", ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", ""I Am A Rock"", ""Mrs Robinson"", ""At The Zoo"", ""A Poem On The Underground Wall"", etc.

My dad also had a taped version on VHS of a wonderful and stunning documentary titled ""Songs Of America"" that was a US TV Special, transmited on November 30, 1969. Sadly, the VHS is so dated that I really wish Paul And Art will realise that we really need it on DVD in badly !!.

This DVD ""Old Friends - Live From Stage"" is basically a nostalgia reunion concert, so I have mixed feelings about it. It's wonderful to see them live, given I hadn't a chance to catch them live in the 60's or the early 80's. But I have to be honest, the reunion is poignant, but far from being an excellent concert.

Their voices have aged badly, they sound more rough and it seems they don't enjoy singing anymore, I mean, they really push hard their voices trying to sound like they sounded in their golden years.

Moreover, I feel some tension in the air, it's clear there's a big wall between the band and them. I can't feel any spontaneity performing the songs both from the band and Paul and Art. Sometimes they really struggle with his voices, and I don't know why they perform almost every song slower than studio versions, so the songs sound flat, uninspired and boring at times.

Production itself is first quality, but I can't say the same about the concert, just compare this nostalgia performance with that wonderful one at ""Live From New York City 1967"" (incredibly overlooked by fans, and it seems - I really don't know why - that still they praise the vastly overrated and half Paul Simon solo album ""Concert In Central Park"") and ""Live From New York City 1967"" blow away this reunion. Sad but true, I have to be honest, sorry.

Please Paul and Art, give a real document of Simon and Garfunkel era by releasing the unforgettable ""Songs Of America"" on DVD plus tons of extra footage. Check this link

2173970,3,B000679NLO,"This DVD is very nice, but not perfect. Talking about both performance and cameras work, I have to rate 7/10 for the performance, 5/10 for the overall concert production ( I don't like when a S & G concert is intended as an ""epic"" reunion rather than a truly comeback to those honest and intimate 60's concerts ) and 7/10 for cameras work. Some songs are performed oustanding as Hazy Shade Of Winter ( an amazing full band version ), Scarborough Fair or The Only Living Boy In New York. Despite their voices are not as cristal clear and rich as they had back in the 60's, you can feel some of that atmosphere, but Live From New York City 1967 is a better performance.

The aspect I most dislike about some renditions is that sometimes their songs are played much more slow than original versions, as Kathy's Song, I Am A Rock, The Sounds Of Silence, The Boxer

One of the worst and the best thing at the same time about this release is that they included some footage probably from their legendary documentary ""Songs Of America"". That documentary was filmed during their 1969, and transmited on November 30 1969. It's such a pity they didn't include the whole film on this DVD, just a few clips. It's an amazing document of the political side of Simon And Garfunkel, featuring live footage and images about what was happening in the US late in the 60's.

2173971,5,B000679NLO,"After reading all of the reviews of this DVD, I felt like I had to throw in my own two cents.  Not because I'm an expert on Simon & Garfunkel, because frankly I'm not.  I wanted to do it because I wanted people to have a review of ""Old Friends"" that wasn't littered with biased opinions and irrelevant chatter.

This was one of the first DVDs I ordered when I joined a mail-order DVD club, which was the same day that I bought my first DVD player.  I thought this show was remarkable.  Great songs, great band, great bonus features.

I bought this DVD before I bought ""The Concert In Central Park.""  To be honest, I only bought the Central Park DVD to see if the rumors were true that Simon and Garfunkel virtually made no eye contact with one another the entire show.  Well, that's stretching it a bit, but there did seem to be a little chill in the air in Central Park on that August evening in 1981.  It is obvious that the atmosphere at the ""Old Friends"" shows was much warmer.

One reviewer spent half his paragraph complaining about the crowd at the ""Old Friends"" shows, claiming that the audience in Central Park was ""more respectful.""  He obviously doesn't remember the guy that jumped up on the stage and tried to attack Paul Simon while he was singing ""The Late Great Johnny Ace"".  Another reviewer thought there wasn't enough banter between and about the songs.  This person obviously hasn't seen ""Central Park"", where there is almost no talk between the songs at all.  Frankly, I bought the DVD to hear them sing, not talk. (So much for leaving my opinions out of it.)

Like many of the other reviewers, I liked ""Old Friends"" more than ""Central Park"", for a few reasons.  First of all, there are more songs on it.  That's always a good thing.  Secondly, the lack of tension between the two performers makes it more enjoyable to watch.  The love and respect Paul and Art have for one another is clearly evident, even if they hadn't actually expressed it.  And, there is much more bonus material on ""Old Friends"".  There is almost no ""bonus"" stuff on ""Central Park"", unless you consider trailers for other movies a ""bonus"".  It's great that they blew the dust off some old footage from 1970.  That was probably my favorite special feature of ""Old Friends"".  I give it 5 stars.  This is a great DVD.",1110326400,9,2308,4.490384615384615
2173972,5,B000679NLO,"I went to see this concert in Columbus, Ohio last year, and I have never had a more satisfying and emotional concert experience.  My only problem is my friends and I were in the cheap seats, and Simon and Garfunkle were tiny figures in the distance, though we could see them on the large monitors above the stage.  This DVD gives me the up close position I wish I could have had that night.  The sound and video quality are excellent, the songs are all part of our culture and history, and they still have the power to deliver them (Check out Art Garfunkle on Bridge Over Troubled Water).  The variations and additions to the songs were interesting and sometimes a real improvement, if that's possible.  For me, this just a chance to revisit the magic and power of that night when I was able to sing along to The Boxer along with the rest of the audience with Simon and Garfunkle listened to us with big smiles on their faces.  This CD and DVD set is a must have for the fans, and especially those of us lucky enough to have been there.",1109462400,3,1036,4.314432989690721

2173974,4,B000679NLO,"I like it better than the Central Park concert, but I also like it better when it's been the 2 of them and just a guitar and would've loved to have seen them do a VH1 ""Storytellers"" together or the types of shows The Eagles, Steely Dan and Fleetwood Mac put out a while back for home video...

The songs sound great, and include a lot of songs that weren't included on the ""Central Park"" concert (that seemed to have more solo material than it should have) which makes this truly worthwhile. It's also great to see them with the Everly Brothers...

I'd pick up the CD/DVD combo pack, but if I had to choose between just the video and CD, I'd pick the video. There are slight differences between both (the DVD has a few songs not on the CD, and the CD has ""Citizen of the Planet"", not on the DVD).

Most of the songs have held up well over the years, even if their voices aren't what they once were, it still sounds like people got their money's worth nonetheless just from the harmonies alone. But it was definitely geared towards the baby boomers more than their kids (and grandkids... must be weird for a 60-something to be singing a song like ""Feelin' Groovy""), but I can't see why all generations wouldn't enjoy it.

I do hope that they can put out more of the 60s era footage though, as they did do a TV special around 1969 (parts of which are on the DVD, they should've put the whole thing on!) and made TV appearances a lot around that time.

But do check out ""Live in New York 1967"" released 2 years ago on CD and the long lost ""Paul Simon Songbook"" which Paul released (more like caved in) not too long ago. Hopefully there will be more archive releases.

Maybe we'll see them together again, but if not, this is a great farewell to a duo who put out some great music in a short period of time that is still being enjoyed 40 years later.",1106092800,5,1846,4.245014245014245

Some person is stating that the crowd was rowdy and the show ""wasn't to be"" and that is a very selfish statement.  The crowd was very well behaved and reacted with genuine honesty to a long overdue reunion. This person also states that the Central Park Album in comparison had a ""more respectful audience"" than MSG or Cont. Arena. Clearly this reviewer didn't notice the loud bursts by audience members cheering and singing along, or Paul thanking ""Ed Koch and the people selling loose joints...etc"" as the crowd ROARED.

There is no rule stating that Folk Rock shouldn't ROCK!  Hey buddy, if you want a respectful audience, go play B.I.N.G.O.  This was a concert, a NEW YORK CITY CONCERT!!!  Lighten Up huh?

It was a very intimate evening with a flawless performance by two seasoned ""Old Friends"". As I said before, I was at 3 shows and each was as good as the one prior.  If you watch the DVD you can clearly see that Art and Paul appreciate the receptive audience.  It wasn't at all rowdy like an AC/DC show.  It was quaint and personable, beautifully arranged with strictly acoustic numbers and others that utilized the ""top notch"" band behind them that created a sound exceeding perfection.

As always there are anal reviewers who feel the need to profess their elitist expectations to downgrade a high quality performance. Don't believe it.  Don't believe them. The show was fantastic!  We should be so lucky to have them perform let alone look and sound great! Madison Square Garden was a perfect venue for them to play and the Continental was a good time as well.

If you love Simon and Garfunkel and are interested in seeing how perfectly well they still perform during this even later chapter of their lives then buy this DVD! It is a perfect addition to every music lover's concert video library.

I have one gripe about the editing and that is they cut out the ""59th Street Bridge Song"" from the CD version as well as ""Wake Up Lil' Susie"" and ""Dream"" w/ the Everly Bros. Other than that, this show goes in my top five favorites.",1104019200,7,2217,4.591370558375634
2173976,5,B000679NLO,"It came Tuesday, and after dinner I suggested to my lovely wife that we should take a look at it. She is not quite the big Paul Simon fan that I am, and wasn't really in the mood, but agreed to watch a song or two.

We ended up watching the whole thing. And last night, much to my suprise, she wanted to watch it again, so we did.

It is a wonderful concert. In many ways the best performances of these songs that I've heard. Paul's guitar has always been a key part of his best work, and it comes across loud and clear here as he plays his beautiful signature Martin in most of the songs.

There are all kinds of nice twists. Art talks quite a bit, and he is a nice counterweight to the generally more serious Simon. Art sings Kathy's Song, which was a treat that I had never heard before. Paul played a new intro to Sounds of Silence that was stunning.

The next to last song was what Art said was their first performance of ""Leaves That Are Green"" since 1967. Paul sang ""I was 21 years when I wrote this song, I'm 22 now, but I won't be for long."" Boy, that's for sure. How a lifetime flashes by.",1103932800,12,1099,4.050691244239632
2173977,4,B000679NLO,"First, let me say that I've been an S&G fan since I first heard ""Sounds of Silence"" in the early 60s. For me, they were the only ones who equaled The Beatles in quality (if not quantity) of brilliant songs. I was hoping for a recording in a more intimate setting befitting their music. From the moment I heard the rowdy audience reception for ""Old friends,"" I knew this wasn't to be. It's Simon and Garfunkle, people, not ACDC! One reviewer claimed this DVD is better than the ""Central Park"" concert, but I disagree. I don't know if it was editing and production or a more respectful audience, but the ""Central Park"" concert seems vastly more intimate and satisfying. Don't get me wrong, if you're a fan you should purchase this DVD. S&G perform brilliantly, and it's a joy for this old timer to see them again 40 years later. I just think the rowdy audience spoils the mood of the music, and I wish a more appropriate venue had been chosen as a record of this historic reunion.",1102636800,13,978,4.4692737430167595

8039766,5,B000679NLO,This is the ultimate live version of Simon & Garfunkel. Forgive them for the lame arrangements and uninspired performances of Concert in Central Park. With Old Friends they have more than redeemed themselves with a magical concert that recaptures their 60s spirit with the added benefit of their mellowed voices. Exhilarating culmination of their talents in this final swan song. Preserve this recording..its all that's left you.,1496534400,,429,5.417910447761194
