2489665,5,B000E4FZLG,"I love this DVD. Mythbusters rulz! Even if the intro music was a little funky. I especially love the Jet Assisted Chevy episode. It's amazing to think that Mythbusters has been around this long. I hope they stay another ten seasons! The DVD itself was in good condition, minor issues with skipping but all in all well worth the price.",1301097600,,334,4.583333333333333
2489666,5,B000E4FZLG,"This is the DVD of the first 3 episodes made for Mythbusters.  And after watching the show for 6 years, you can tell they seem dated. But thats the beauty of it!  Its nice to see them back before they got famous.  Plus, its really cool to see M5 the way it was so long ago.  This is the second time I have owned this dvd.  Thinking that these 3 episodes were in the first season set I accidentally gave away my pilot episodes dvd.  This is a MUST HAVE for Mythbusters fans!",1268611200,,473,4.032258064516129
2489667,5,B000E4FZLG,These fresh-faced Mythbusters take you through how it all started!  Great DVD!  Will enjoy it for a long time!,1264550400,,110,4.7368421052631575
2489668,5,B000E4FZLG,"Adam and Jamie make a great team. Adam is funny and goofy, while Jamie is serious. They make the show so much fun to watch you don't even realize you are learning something until it is to late.",1163635200,,193,4.105263157894737
8105746,5,B000E4FZLG,I love it that all 3 episodes are in this set.,1492905600,,46,3.272727272727273
8105747,5,B000E4FZLG,"I love the Mythbusters and was looking for these 3 episodes, as they are not included on the 1st season release through Discovery.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching them and am already looking forward to watching them again in ~6 months.  Did I mention I really like Mythbusters?",1448755200,,276,4.851063829787234
8105748,5,B000E4FZLG,"I bought Season One Mythbusters and was disappointed to find out that these episodes were not there. A couple months later I accidently stumbled across this three episode set on sale! The set normally retails for 3/4 the price of a full 30 episode season, but I found the last one in stock at 2/3 off retail! After watching the three episodes I would have to concur that if you are a true Mythbusters fan, then YES, even though it's a gouge in the wallet, the full price is still worth it for this set, if you can find it!",1427414400,,522,4.23
8105749,5,B000E4FZLG,"Go back to where it all started.  These shows are more raw and less polished than the later episodes.  It is fun to watch the Mythbusters fly by the seat of their pants and just make it up as they go.  Classic moments like JETO rocket car, Kari's butt mold, Adam being a goofball, and Jamie being Jaime.  Buy it, watch it, love it.",1405123200,,331,4.125
8105750,5,B000E4FZLG,"From what my sixty-five year old brain can remember
--- after all those HENDRIX concerts ---
I don't r=e=m=e=m=b=e=r these ""first three episodes"".

Collections ten AND eleven have one episode that's on
BOTH
collections.",1390176000,,219,5.4411764705882355
8105751,5,B000E4FZLG,"Where it all started from... It's really interesting to look back and see how much trouble they had getting their myths off the ground, how much Jamie looked like he didn't want to be there, and how basic their ideas were. Comparing it to their later series is a great exercise, but there is something really endearing about their early efforts. That and the myths were actually really entertaining.",1384732800,,399,4.797101449275362
8105752,5,B000E4FZLG,"i bought this because we love the mythbusters at home.  we were taking a road trip so i was hoping for peace during the travel...bingo!  kids were glued to adam and jamie!  i like it because it is informative, educational, and a decent length.
love the experiments...the kids truly enjoyed it...will buy others as well!",1345507200,,319,4.763636363636364
8105753,5,B000E4FZLG,"I'm going to try and sell anyone on Mythbusters - they're great and we all know it. I was very disappointed to find out that these three pilot episodes were not on the first season dvd set (the first of many episodes not to be included on those season sets) and that Discovery had stopped selling this collection. I was very happy to see it here at amazon and even happier I picked it up. Adam and Jamie are so young and just learning the format of the show (as are the crew, who interact with the hosts in a way lost in later episodes) and it all feels a bit more raw and less ""produced."" We even get to see Kari make her first appearance on the show - beating appearances of her two cohorts (Grant/Tori) by quite a long time. The myths are all true urban legends that were going around for decades and their is genuine fun in watching the cast think of ways to test their theories. These are some of the most re-watchable episodes of the entire series and well worth the buy while they are still available!",1342224000,,1008,4.227979274611399
8105754,5,B000E4FZLG,I love the show but found the series late so have been playing catch up. I find it fascinating to see how it all began and how far it's come must have for all  fan's of the show.,1329177600,,178,3.6842105263157894
8105755,3,B000E4FZLG,"I'm still surprised why they didn't include these pilots in the first season box but you should definitely own these 3 episodes if you're a Mythbusters fan.
Content wise I'm rating this 5 stars. However, the price is way too high ($25.79 at the moment I'm writing this). You're paying more than half the price of a complete season box which contains 10 times as many episodes.",1318809600,,376,4.626865671641791
