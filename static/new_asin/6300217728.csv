266706,5,6300217728,"I was expecting a boring sappy story about ballet, what I found was one of the most entertaining films ever.  It is a wondrous look at the world of ballet.  Who knew that a Midwest teen would find ballet cool.  The cast is super especially Boris.  We watch two young people achieve their dreams in the competitive world.  They start out ignorant and ignored in a great scene where both Julian and Vicky are pushed aside. There is a wonderful shot from the stage that is dizzying to show Vicky's perspective.  Highlighted by a beautiful ballet piece in the middle.  The sequence is a great moment on film.  Beautifully photographed with wondrous lights and special effects.  It takes the sequence to another level.  Hypnotic and mystifying.  A wonderful scene is the dance with the newspaper.  The curious changing of perspective shows us a glimpse into the future with Boris and Julian appearing in the dance briefly.  This of course leads to a fascinating parallel of the Red Shoes in the lives of Vicky, Julian, and Boris.  In the film's most powerful scene the Red Shoes goes on without anyone in Vicky's role.",975283200,17,1113,4.729166666666667
266707,5,6300217728,"One of the most beautiful films ever made gets the ultimate treatment, on  this DVD from The Criterion Collection. This film shows us the awesome,  driving, life consuming force that races through any artist who wants to be  the best at that particular art form. In this film, Vicky is the ballerina  who ""needs"" to dance to live. We see her amazing journey as she  looses herself in the ""Red Shoes"" ballet sequence. Which is one  of the most daring and artistic statements made in film history. Her  husband is a composer / conducter and his music is his passion.  But when  Vicky is forced to make a choice between her love for her husband or her  love to dance ""The Red Shoes"" the results are frightening,  hypnotic, and tragic. A film you will never forget, and always cherish for  it's powerful statement, and it's sheer beauty. Criterion's transfer is  stunning and the bonus material is great !! Get this DVD and see the  results of a beautifully crafted film getting the ""best""  treatment it could get in the digital realm !!",968198400,11,1033,4.5989010989010985
266708,5,6300217728,"Many of Powell and Pressburger's films explore the life of the artist and the power of the artistic imagination.  In THE RED SHOES and PEEPING TOM, most notably, the writer-directors reveal the sacrifices that art sometimes  demands from its acolytes.
Balletophiles often praise THE RED SHOES, but  one need not be a fan of ballet to be amazed by the film's emotional power  and extraordinary staging. On the Criterion DVD, the saturated reds that  represent the artist's blood sacrifice, and the cool aqua-blues that  represent the (false) promise of life and romance outside of art, appear  with unmatched vividness.  Powell is a master of color, and has influenced  a generation of filmmakers (through the advocacy of his admirer Martin  Scorcese) with his theories about how color and music contribute to the  thematic impact of a film.
Anton Walbrook, who plays the impressario  Lermontov in THE RED SHOES, is one of Powell and Pressburger's favorite  actors, appearing to stunning effect in THE LIFE AND DEATH OF COLONEL BLIMP  as well.  Moira Shearer, the actress/dancer who plays the lead, made her  reputation on THE RED SHOES.  She also dances in one segment of the  rarely-seen Powell/Pressburger masterpiece THE TALES OF HOFFMAN.
The  Criterion DVD has the beautiful sound and picture we've come to expect from  the Voyager Company.  Interesting disc features include: an audio track of  Jeremy Irons reading from the original Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale,  the complete text of Powell and Pressburger's novelization of the movie, an  extensive collection of Scorcese's memorabilia, and a comparison of the Red  Shoes Ballet with the filmed storyboard sketches the directors used as a  guide.  One wonderful addition for Powell and Pressburger fans is their  filmography -- brief descriptions with cast lists and dates for all their  films, most of which also have film clips included.  It's a chance to see  scenes from some of the long-lost works in their catalogue.",957225600,127,1986,5.170347003154574
266709,5,6300217728,"I've seen the original film of ""The Red Shoes"" a number of times over the years and just loved it. The story, ballet, music, color, actors, and the whole production are superb!
Later I acquired the RCA  SelectaVision CED video disc edition (two parts) in the early 1980s.  The  CED issue unfortunately was prone to frame skipping, occasionally  syncopating the ballet sequences.  Still later, I obtained the Paramount  VHS hi-fi release (1987).  There was no frame skipping with the VHS tape,  but the tops of all the frames tended to be somewhat bent and fluttery.  Alas, I found no remedies for these problems.
Without question, this DVD  release is the best of the lot, technically.  And, I liked the additional  background material contributed to this DVD edition.  The DVD has great  color with clear, well focused images.  The only deficiency, in my opinion,  is the movie sound track which sounds dated (1947), however it's on par or  better than the forementioned VHS release.
Overall, I would class this  DVD movie as one I would have to take, along with others, to a desert  island on which I subsequently became marooned.",951436800,103,1132,4.863157894736842

Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburgers wonderful The Red Shoes is a film lauded quite rightly on a number of counts. Many regard it as the best film the Archers ever made. It was voted 8th greatest British film by the BFI in 1999 and some would no doubt see it as being No. 1. Martin Scorsese has announced it alongside Jean Renoirs The River (1951) as the most beautiful color film in existence and the use of Technicolor is indeed staggering. The gorgeous textures which leap out and beg to be touched and luxuriated in look their sumptuous best in this Scorsese-sponsored special restoration which debuted at Cannes 2009. Those unsure whether to choose this single DVD release or go for the 11 DVD ITV box should note the boxed version looks good, but is not in the same league as the restored version I am reviewing here which is pin sharp perfection itself. The film is said to be the greatest film about ballet and though I cant claim to have seen them all, I have come across none better. It is the film that has inspired any number of would-be ballerinas and benefits greatly from Powell/Pressburgers insistence on using dancers who act as opposed to merely using actors who can dance a little bit. In addition to star performers L&eacute;onide Massine and Robert Helpmann, dancers of the Covent Garden Royal Ballet were deployed and its no exaggeration to say that Moira Shearer sacrificed her dance career to appear in this film. She also appears in The Tales of Hoffmann (1951) and Powell was forced against his better judgment (she was thought too glamorous) to deploy her yet again in Peeping Tom (1960) in acknowledgment of her commitment to him curtailing her career as a serious dancer on stage.

The film is also outstanding for its remarkable original score from Brian Easdale, the whole of the short ballet within the film (also called The Red Shoes) conducted from beginning to end by Thomas Beecham and containing music good enough to rank alongside other notable 20th century ballet scores from the likes of Stravinsky and Bart&oacute;k. This ballet doesnt stop the film or even hinder the narrative. It is placed at the films very apex and is carefully integrated within the films wider structure to state in miniature Powell/Pressburgers great theme  a meditation on the artistic creative urge and its essential incompatibility with life. The central triangular relationship between the ballerina Vicky Page (Shearer), the composer Julian Craster (Marius Goring) and the impresario Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) amplifies the meaning beyond dance to take in all art-forms  dance (Vicky), music (Julian) and both literature and filmmaking (Boris). Lermontov in particular is a fascinating catch-all demonic metaphor for the pursuit of artistic excellence. Given the name of a famous Russian Romantic poet, he is modeled variously on the great impresario of the Ballets Russes Sergei Diaghilev, the film producer J. Arthur Rank and the film director Michael Powell. The film is one of cinemas great meditations on the Faustian pact wherein the artist sells his soul for artistic creativity, but when the bargain is broken by the human temptations of life, the devil is sitting right there waiting to collect. What follows contains spoilers.

The ballet within the film contains the essence of Powell/Pressburgers argument and is perhaps the best place to begin any analysis. Hans Christian Andersens fairy tale morality fable The Red Shoes is the story of a girl named Karen who neglects looking after her bed-ridden kindly old guardian in favor of going to a ball wearing her favorite red shoes. An angel bewitches the shoes as punishment and Karen is danced everywhere by them. Returning home she learns her guardian has died from her neglect and she weeps, begging the angel-executioner not to cut off her head, but to sever her feet and shoes with his axe instead. She attempts to hobble to the church on wooden feet and crutches but her severed feet still wearing the red shoes continue to dance in her way. She goes instead to a parsonage where she studies the Bible and is eventually forgiven by the angel and allowed to go to church.

Powell/Pressburgers version is radically different. The central moral is downplayed in favor of a simple choice between leading a normal everyday life where the creation of art is impossible and killing that life thus releasing limitless potential for artistic creation. The shoe maker/seller is a Mephistopheles figure who bewitches a pair of red shoes which excites the artistic drive in whoever wears them. The price is the persons soul in which all possibility of pursuing a normal life is swept away. Karen is now a nameless young girl out with her boyfriend one day who sees the shoes in a shop window, buys and wears them. Instantly she is taken off on an exotic flight of fantasy across city and country. Her boyfriend is abandoned (a mere image on a huge sheet of cellophane which she tramples upon) and she spurns all other human contact in the impulse to dance on and on. She eventually tires, but (as Lermontov describes to Julian while obscenely massaging the plaster-cast of a ballet shoe cut off at the ankle just as the original Andersen fairy tale describes) the red shoes are never tired. They dance her [everywhere]. Time rushes by, love rushes by, life rushes by. But the red shoesdance on until she dies and the shoes are reclaimed by the shoemaker for the next victim who would dare make a Faustian pact for limitless artistic creation. Closely tied into this Faustian scenario runs a distinctly Jungian subtext which Powell/Pressburger together with stage designer Hein Heckroth amplify through the archetype of the fairy tale presenting artistic ambition as the desire for the maiden (the animus) to achieve maturity through the construction of a defense mechanism in the shape of her shadow incarnated by the shoemaker. In Jungian theory the split in the human psyche is denoted in fairy tales as a division between the natural and the supernatural, the fight between the opposite halves being the animus route to the maturation of artistic ambition in this case. In the Andersen original the battle leads to the very moral maiming of the maid (she can dance no more), and she is led back to normality through Bible study. In Powell/Pressburgers version the shadow wins completely and all life is crushed out. By choosing limitless artistic creation she has unwittingly chosen death, her libido crushed by/supplanted by her unconscious innermost desire to dance, her shadow reigning triumphant.

Powell/Pressburgers visualization of the ballet with Heckroth is stunningly evocative. Not only do they pictorialize Karens totentanz (dance of death) in the most sumptuous tones to tell a fictional fairy tale, the images they choose are taken directly from the dancer Vickys life which we see elsewhere in the film. For example, Julians description to Vicky of how his music will affect her (My music will transform you. A flower swaying in the wind. A cloud drifting in the sky. A white bird flying) is visualized exactly as he says. Karens story is Vickys story exactly which means that the ballet is suffused with the reality of the film that surrounds it and that the reality of the film that surrounds it is equally suffused with the fantasy of the ballet. Critics of the films overall lack of realism should note then that the artificiality of the main story is very deliberate as Powell/Pressburger play their trademark game of fusing realism and fantasy to intoxicating effect, a practice perfected in their previous films A Matter of Life and Death (1946) and especially in Black Narcissus (1947), the film that immediately precedes this one and which is also noted for its sophisticated psychosexual treatment incorporating ideas of both Freud and Jung.

As befits the simple fairy tale at its center, the central narrative of the film is also simple and can be related in a few short sentences. The three central characters attend separately the opening night of a ballet called Heart of Fire given by Ballet Lermontov at Covent Garden. Julian reveals to Lermontov that he is the real composer of the ballets music while Vicky reveals to him her dancing ambitions. He decides to employ both. He takes them on tour to first Paris and then Monte Carlo. Both impress and Lermontov commands Julian to compose a ballet called The Red Shoes for Vicky to dance. The ballets great success leads to a tour where Julian conducts Vicky in all the great roles of the repertoire. They fall in love. Lermontov cannot abide human feelings interfering with art and causes an argument which leads to both Julian and Vicky leaving the company. Lermontov continues running his enterprise while Julian composes an opera and Vicky (now his wife) hardly dances at all. Lermontov spies a way to either achieve his greatest ambition with Vicky as a dancer or to destroy her and her husband forever. He persuades her to dance The Red Shoes for him the very night of the premi&egrave;re of Julians opera. Just before the performance Julian confronts Vicky in front of Lermontov. Which does she love more, dance or her husband? She seems to choose dance for Julian leaves devastated. Lermontov exults, but the red shoes have the final say. They sweep Vicky away from the stage, down the stairs, out of the theater and off the balcony in search of Julian. The film ends as the ballet ends with the dying heroine begging to be released from the shoes which have destroyed her. Meanwhile Lermontov returns to the shadow of his box and watches the ballet with a spotlight trained on where Vicky would have danced. The show must go on and a new dancer must now be found who is willing to sell her soul to him for the pursuit of artistic perfection.

For Powell/Pressburger it is to be noted that their film represents an entire world which corresponds to the ballet of the same title. The ballet falls exactly in the middle of the film and is divided into two parts, day (when the girl freely dances her heart out) and night (when she stays out instead of returning home and falls prey to an internal death-drive). The film correspondingly falls also into two parts, the first half leading up to the ballet is day in which all protagonists egg each other on in a burst of creativity, and the second half after the ballet is night in which the same characters are sucked into their death-drives. The ballet echoes the structure of the entire film suggesting that one is the other exactly. It is fitting that the film should open with another ballet titled Heart of Fire. Heart represents life/passion and fire represents danger/passion, the films central dichotomy subtly stated right here. Both are carried forward in the red shoes and the red hair of Vicky and suggest a desire for an alternative life of passionate artistic pursuit as opposed to a dispassionate non-life of artistic mediocrity. Apart from a few establishing shots of locations and two romantic sequences in Monte Carlo there are few exterior shots in the film. We never really leave the theater and its environs throughout and the opening is vital in establishing the central triangular relationship. Ballet is often defined as music made visible and both aspects are present offstage as well as on. In Jungian terms the world of the ballet is the films psyche, the music is the male anima (Julian) and the dance is the female animus (Vicky). The conduit for releasing the individuation of the opposing halves of the psyche into a perfect whole is the shadow (Lermontov) who we first see significantly lurking in the shadows of his box sitting beside the fraud composer Prof. Palmer (Austin Trevor). The anima and animus are both young and yearn to grow up and succeed in their ambitions, to be renowned composer and a prima-ballerina respectively. This conflicts with the normal path of psycho-sexual development which should be individuation with each other to make a perfect male-female whole, a psyche devoid of shadow. The shadow is both created by and instrumental in delivering their professional ambitions, but at the cost of sacrificing this natural course. This is spelt out clearly by Lermontov after he learns that his current prima-ballerina Boronskaja (Ludmilla Tch&eacute;rina) is getting married. With Vicky clearly listening behind him he says, You cant have it both ways. The dancer who relies upon the doubtful comforts of human love will never be a great dancer, never. But you cant alter human nature, protests Ljubov (Massine) to which Lermontov answers grimly, No? I think you can do even better than that. You can ignore it.

The films central romance is framed by two balcony scenes. The first shows Julian and Vicky in ecstasy at having just learned they are to create a new ballet. They are not yet in love, but the air is full of ambition about to be fulfilled. As they speak a train passes beneath and steam consumes them as a premonition of both love and death. The second is of course Vickys dramatic leap from the same balcony into more train steam, this time with Julian running towards her along the train platform. Between these two scenes are three stages, the first of which showing the anima and the animus in conflict, striking creative sparks off each other as they put their ballet together much to the amusement of the shadow reveling devilishly in the release of artistic creativity. The staging of the whole ballet is the culmination of this process and the acme of the professional happiness of all three, but it significantly dramatizes the psychological torment that Vicky is experiencing in the shape of both Lermontov and Julian appearing on stage in threatening roles which drive her on as demonically as the red shoes do. As the girl attempts to go home (her guardian standing in the doorway), the shoemaker drags her away morphing first into Lermontov and then into Julian. As much as she is using them to succeed they are also using her, Julian to make his music visible and famous, Lermontov to advance on to that ever-elusive idea of artistic perfection in ballet. This moment comes at the very center of the film when the ballet (and the whole film surrounding it) segues from day to night, marking the point where perfection of artistry is pushed over into neurosis and imminent psychosis. In her beginning lies her end and Powell underlines it exquisitely with an astonishing close-up of her face, eyes wide open and petrified to the depths of her soul.

The second stage sees the shadow pushing both anima and animus even further, especially the animus as Vicky is taken on a tour of all the top ballet roles. Both halves are inevitably attracted romantically to each other and the scene of the pair in a horse-drawn carriage being driven along the coast with the beautiful sea behind them is important for being shot outside the theater away from the artistic drive which would deny their relationship. Once the shadow finds out his deal has been broken, he wastes no time in forcing the lovers to choose between human love and the inhuman pursuit of artistic excellence.

The third stage starts with the anima and animus united in love with the shadow spurned, but the shadow finds a way to bring the animus back into the creative fold which he knows will destroy both completely. The shadow dogs the animus and there is a wonderful scene which starts and finishes with him reading letters from both at his desk in a darkened room. In between we are taken to their home at night where they lie awake in separate beds, anima and animus significantly divided. They are shown to yearn more for their art than each other. The anima leaves his bed to work on his opera at the piano while the animus leaves hers to search for her ballet shoes now sitting unused in her drawer. She eventually goes to him and they embrace so we are given the idea that this scene is for real, but the fact that the same candelabra we saw behind the animus when the shadow met her at the party early in the film now sits on the piano and that we are taken back immediately to the shadow having not moved an inch from his desk suggests that what we have seen is a projection of his power over the two in that we see them as he visualizes them. The shadow is influencing his prey from afar in the shape of regret welling from the repression of career ambition. In this way the animus is separated from the anima and returned to her lifes true vocation, but the anima reacts badly. The opera (significantly titled Cupid and Psyche) is obviously based on his relationship with the animus and one cant survive without the other. By leaving him she in a way kills him and is on the way to killing herself. When the anima makes his dramatic appearance in the dressing room before the performance he is wearing a striking black raincoat to signify his death. This final scene is hugely impressive as the animus is forced into the impossible position of choosing between the two things she loves equally  the desire to dance and the desire for her anima, one symbolizing the death of the other. The shadow meanwhile states his case for art against life sarcastically egging Vicky to return to Julian: Go with him! Be a faithful housewife with a crowd of screaming children! Finish with dancing forever! Then soothingly, Vicky, Vicky  [artistic greatness] is all waiting for you! The sorrow will pass believe me. Life is so unimportant. And from now onwards you will dance like nobody ever before! Finally, the shadow seems to win and the anima retreats broken leaving the animus in the shadows power, but the anima clings on in the form of the opera he has written which we hear playing on the wireless. As the animus walks towards the stage (towards the camera!) the soprano voice (Psyche we assume) dominates the soundtrack until that extraordinary moment when the animus snaps and the music changes from the opera to the overture of The Red Shoes (this snap is a virtual repeat shot of the close-up of the girls panic-stricken face in the ballet as she is dragged from her guardian by the shoemaker/Lermontov/Julian). The red shoes she is wearing assume command of her life, sweeping her down the stairs and off the balcony to her death. In this scene of stage merging with reality, the animus shows love for both sides of her choice in a moment of superb ambiguity. She is both rushing towards her anima to individuate the psyche and lead a normal life, and she is fulfilling her artistic vocation by dancing. But the two are irreconcilable and the result is the death of both halves of the psyche (the animus physically and the anima mentally). This leads to the perfect symmetry of the shadow once more sinking back into the darkness of his theater box where we first met him at the films outset, the game set to be played again with another who would dare play muse to the devilish drive towards artistic perfection.

One of the great joys of this film is the wonderful characterization of the various roles in the dance company. Ballet Lermontov is based on the Ballets Russes and Lermontovs weird perfectionism is closely modeled on that of Sergei Diaghilev. Its widely accepted that the dynamic between Lermontov and Vicky is secretly gay, Vicky playing Nijinsky to Lermontovs Diaghilev. Adding authenticity is the casting of L&eacute;onide Massine who in fact choreographed ballets (the premi&egrave;re of Stravinskys Pulcinella to name one) for Diaghilev and was himself also his lover at one stage. Here Massine plays Ljubov, the company choreographer in a hilarious larger than life performance which lights up every scene hes in with camp humour. He doesnt choreograph this films dancing. That is done by Robert Helpmann who we also see as Ivan Boleslawsky and the friendly rivalry between the two is another delight, especially the scene where they eye each other like a couple of rival peacocks preening themselves at the practice bar. Also adding color to the company are old Dmitri (Eric Berry) the stage designer and Livy (Esmond Knight) the in-house conductor. He is delightfully withering in his cutting remarks to Julian at first, but when he recognizes the boys talent he doesnt stand in his way and endearingly goes out of his way to help him. It is typical of a Powell/Pressburger film that in the middle of so much fairy tale fantasy such attention is paid to the realism of how a ballet company is run and also to ensuring that all characters are warm, human and wonderfully sympathetic except of course for the strange man running the show.

Lermontov is undoubtedly the most fascinating character of the film and his shadow looms (it feels) over everything we see. This is done partly by extending his personality to include aspects of the filmmakers. Powell was also famously meticulous in the way he set up shots and drove his actors (they all hated me, he was later fond of saying) while the scene of Lermontov busy in his office after the success of the ballet in which he carries on several conversations simultaneously on the phone, to attendant reporters and to various members of staff, is acknowledged as being the very picture of J. Arthur Rank in action conducting his own business. Most affective of all is the way this stage impresario/film director/film producer haunts the narrative from beginning to end. I have already noted his presence in the shadows of his theatre box framing the entire film and virtually every memorable visual flourish and significant scene is keyed by emphasizing his shadowy presence. He is standing in the shadows when he realizes Julians conducting potential as he rehearses Heart of Fire. He is present in the Mercury Theater to see Vicky dance in Swan Lake, his image glimpsed fleetingly by her as she executes a series of pirouettes, so fleetingly that she isn't sure if hes there or not. He is ever-present in the shadows as he enjoys Julian bullying Vicky in rehearsals for The Red Shoes and in the ballet itself he appears on stage to drag Vicky into the night and to her fate. Whole scenes are shot with Lermontov lurking in darkness which underline his heartless/lifeless drive for perfection. Immediately after Boronskaja announces her marriage and he states his hatred of it (he has no heart, that man, she says) he is lurking in the dark before Julian enters and he asks him to compose music for The Red Shoes, his hand massaging that severed ballet-shoed foot as if dancing to death is ALL he is interested in. One of the most disturbing scenes has him in great anxiety, muttering things to himself in the dark of his Paris apartment because of Vicky and Julians marriage. He famously sees his own reflection and smashes the mirror in a moment of self-hate perhaps for the humanity he cant feel. Like much else in the film this is a moment of great ambiguity. Is he hating himself for his lack of humanity, or is he hating himself because he has just decided to free Vicky and let her dance wherever she wants and he is hating his own weakness? Later in another darkened scene he begins to write a letter to Vicky to invite her back. Does this scene suggest his love for her, or at least some kind of sinister obsession with her, or is he simply using her to suck out her soul for his sense of artistic perfection? There is ground for reading Lermontovs behavior as being the act of a jealous lover whose muse has deserted him to inspire another (Julian of course), but his attack on domesticity and the doubtful comforts of human love wherein life is unimportant, suggest he represents the antithesis of life and love  death and hate. This makes the creation of his art acts of some kind of warped necrophilia. Just after the triumph of The Red Shoes Lermontov talks to Vicky and says, You asked me a question to which I gave a stupid answer. You asked me if I wanted to live and I said yes. Actually, I want more, much more. I want to create, to make something big out of something little. To make a great dancer out of youWhat do you want from life? To live? Vicky answers instantly, To dance. The films central dichotomy is right there  to live or to dance which means Lermontovs artistic mission more than anything else represents death. That is why he is always lurking in the shadows and that is why when he is severing relationships with artists he wears a black funeral suit and black tie with enormous black sunglasses and with skin whitened almost as much as it is at the end of The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943). He wears this suit once when he says goodbye to Boronskaja following her marriage announcement and then once again when he leaves Vicky in the hands of Julian.

Vicky and Julian have very few scene for themselves and where they are alone Lermontov looms large over them to the point that they feel like extensions of himself. One of the films rare exterior shots has Vicky responding to Lermontovs invitation to a date. She dresses up regally like a princess and our mouths drop open at the beautiful vistas of the coast near Monte Carlo as she is driven and then the extraordinary beauty of the deserted villa with its overgrown steps which she ascends. We sense Vicky spreading her wings and luxuriating in her circumstances, but of course the rug is pulled from beneath her feet when she discovers her date is actually a work appointment and the group of men assembled all chuckle silently to each other at how over-dressed she is. Of course this the meeting where she learns she is to be prima-ballerina in The Red Shoes and so shes sent away on a high. Her rollercoaster life is completely dictated by the Lermontov. The same applies to Julian who learns in the scene immediately following that he is to compose the entire score from scratch. Of all Marius Gorings performances for Powell/Pressburger this is my favorite. He doesnt have a single scene to himself, but his boyish passion, startling green eyes and brown hair (shot to look like its red to match Vickys especially in the final dressing room scene  anima/animus of course) all make an electrifying impact, especially in the scene where he is dismissed from the company with his famous riposte to the boss dismissing ballet as a second rate means of expression. The idea that Vicky and Julian are extensions of Lermontov is underlined most strikingly of all of course in the scene I have already described where his shadow pries them apart in their very bedroom.

I have focused mainly on the fairy tale and attendent Faustian/Jungian connotations because I believe that to be where the heart of this film lies. Another review might focus more on the extraordinary symmetry of Pressburgers screenplay (written with Keith Winter some years before) which compares with F. W. Murnaus Sunrise (1927) in its balanced perfection. One might also write a book on Jack Cardiffs extraordinarily textured Technicolor cinematography. Every scene is drop dead gorgeous to behold and matches exactly the theme at hand. The Red Shoes is certainly one of Powell/Pressburgers greatest films. I personally prefer both Black Narcissus and The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, but that is just personal taste on my part. This is a classic film which truly lives up to its exalted reputation.",1496620800,,27554,4.810086516142646

267019,4,6300217728,"Usually this reviewer would not find time or inclination to view a film that was centered on the ballet, or ballerinas. Nothing against ballet, ballet in the flesh which he has seen on many occasions. The film under review though, The Red Shoes, intrigued him in two ways since he had actually read the Hans Christian Andersen story as a kid (as a kid before he realized that a lot of fairy-tale type stories should perhaps not be told to children, not told because they are too scary or tragic as here making one wonder about the personalities of the fairy-tale writers) and because he was interested in the story within a story idea that animated the film (The Red Shoes Ballet based on the Andersens story).

In a way the story line is simplicity itself for those who know that in the Andersen tale the latest possessor of the red shoes is made to dance until death by the demonic shoemaker, the devil himself of you thing about it, after enticing the female victim with desire for them. There is a rough parallel to that theme in the film although it starts out as a more conventional Svengali like piece. Vicky, played by Moira Shearer, is an up and coming ballet dancer who is looking for a break like many other young dancers with a famous ballet company run by Boris, played by Anton Walbrook, who alternates between ruthless tyrant and benevolent despot. He lets Vicky in to see what she is made of and after viewing an afternoon local production of her in Swan Lake he decides to keep her in his company as they travel to Monte Carlo for the season.
Vicky was kind of left stalling around until the prima ballerina was with child and that was her big opening. Along the way Boris had also hired Julian, play by Marius Goring, to write scores for his ballets. In this way Vicky and Julian meet and at first are adversaries but through their collaboration as main dancer and score writer in the production of the Red Shoes Ballet they turn into lovers. Boris who sees the next best thing for his company in Vicky is initially furious because of the dashing of his artistic reasons for wanting her single once the young pair get married. Boris realized though that he loves Vicky, or at least has strong romantic feelings for her although he was a bit short on showing that side of himself-ever. To get even, to break the pair up after the huge success of The Red Shoes Ballet, Boris fired Julian and in his train Vicky followed.

Vicky had her own agenda as well since she was as struck by stardom as any other promising dancer and although she followed Julian back to London while he was working on his first opera the bright lights got to her. She went back to Boris company in Monte Carlo after he promised her a revival of the Red Shoe Ballet. On opening night Julian showed up from London on the night his own opera was opening to bring his wife home. Vicky initially balked since she was torn between Boris and Julians visions for her, and her own as well. At first Boris won out but then Vicky turned tail and ran after the departing dejected Julian. But as she ran down the steps with her red shoes on to rejoin Julian she either tripped or jumps over a balustrade and into an on-coming train. Near death she asked Julian to take the damn red shoes off of her feet. Yeah, damn those red shoes that did in Andersens dancer and poor Vicky too. Watch this one as well for all the then very famous dancers the producers brought in to make this a very realistic ballet film-in early version technicolor too.",1475020800,,3518,4.444272445820434

It's just all so sad.
This movie became one of my top list right away I mean even during watching it exactly during 1:00:00 It was already on the top of my list.
Don't get me wrong I saw about 20,000 movies and owns about 4,000 dvds and blurays by now stop counting since 2014.
Got the idea how peaky by now selecting movies?

This movie made me a real heartbeat and preciely when the whole crew include the main actress/ dancer Moira Shearer (Victoria Page)  and the composer/conductor Marius Goring (JULIAN) and of course the CEO of the company palyed by Anton Walbrook (Boris Lermontov) are all very nervous about the first ballet play, I was even so excited and so nervous that I couldn't move at all.
This movie is a magic and through the entire time which is 133 minutes, I just had to watch it without a pause, no air, no smell, no noise,
NOTHING CAN STOP ME AT ALL.

The story is as well as visual is so so perfect and all in all magic. I'm gonna use this word a lot since there is nothing else I can discribe the beauty of this movie. I should maybe create a new word to make you understand how beautiful this movie is.

The story is about the new Composer.
The story is about the new dancer.
and the story is about the CEO of the dancing stage company.

Both dancer and the composer were discovered by the CEO Anton Walbrook (Boris Lermontov). He has this true genious eyes that if he sees real talented person, he just have to grab them no matter what it takes.
He grabbed the unknown composer who just got out from college and screwed by his very professor who used his scores without notice by his name.
Anton(BORIS) asks him to be the director by just listening to some of his own music that he composed. Just like that. The biggest ballet dancing play stage group hires a guy like him. But he knew his true talent. But there is one thing he cannot bear. A woman who is in love and is all into love who should have only one thing which is WORK.
He fires the great dancer right away when she announces that she is going to be married. She is very excited and the CEO cannot see her at all.
He is that kind of guy. Evreryone hated him about that. But no one talked about it.
Then came the new face Moira Shearer(JULIAN). She fought a lot with the composer/ conductor Marius Goring (JULIAN).
But someone said people fall in love during fighting.
They madly fall in love after the first show.

The first show was of course THE RED SHOES. It was a great success. I couldn't take my eyes off the whole time. The SFX, the dancing, the music, everything was beyond my belief. Don't you dare to compare with <BLACK SWAN>. I am a huge fan of that movie before this film. Now that <BLACK SWAN> seems like a kid suff.

Then you know what, the CEO becomes angry at what happened to them fall in love. And everything becomes messy.
He wants Moira to break up with Julian.
Instead they both quite and get married. But sadly Moira couldn't have enough dancing job and one day when the CEO asks her to come to him again for the great THE RED SHOES lead roll, she couldn't refuse.
Find out all that, even if he had to stop working for this work, he came to her and tells her that you should choose me or the dancing for the CEO.
She at last chooses him but sadly she steps wrong way and jump off the bridge dies by the train.
She finally asks her husband to take off her red shoes to be relieved from everything.
The fame, the dance, the audience, the passion, the life, but not love.

Thus is the central theme of The Red Shoes: to achieve true mastery of anything, one must make great sacrifice. It isn't a unique concept by any means, but a powerful one that has had very much success on the screen recently with phenomenal films like Whiplash and Black Swan. In fact, it is very clear after watching this film that Aronosfky was heavily influenced by it, even directly taking some camera techniques like the first-person angle as the lead pirouettes.

But where Black Swan is a dark and disturbing thriller, The Red Shoes is more of a drama, firmly rooted in reality (save for the hallucinatory and breathtaking performance of the titular ballet midway through... but more on that later). Rather than portray a sacrifice of the mind as we saw with Natalie Portman's descent into madness in Black Swan, The Red Shoes focuses more on social sacrifice.

Similar to Whiplash, we have a ruthless ballet leader, Boris Lermontov, whose greatest focus and ambition in life is to create the greatest dancer the world has ever seen. He is consumed by the art, likening it to a religion, and demands that his dancers abide by the same philosophy. To work with him, they most forgo simple human pleasures like love and marriage, as he believes these will corrupt their ability to practice and perform with all of their focus.

Enter composer Julian Crastor and ballerina Victoria Page, both of whom are supremely talented in their respective fields and have lofty ambitions for their own artistic pursuits. Lermontov sees a similar passion in them as he has himself, and selects them both for his dance company, culminating in the on-screen performance of ""The Red Shoes"", their first ballet together as a trio.

I can't say enough about the how great this performance is filmed and executed. While the rest of the film feels very realistic and dramatic, the ballet performance is like watching a dream. The themes of the movie untether themselves from the script and are brought to life visually in a magnificent way. There is some truly fantastic editing throughout the sequence and the entire thing is extremely compelling as Page's character is forced to feverishly dance by her magical red shoes until she eventually drops dead. The way the performance spirals downward to become more and more bizarre with imagery that is darker and darker is handled extremely well and helps the themes really hit home.

After the performance ends, we reenter the real world and the movie continues in the dramatic, realistic fashion as had been previously established. The crux of the plot from here is that Page and Crastor develop a romance, which Lermontov obviously disapproves of. Long story short, Page must choose between her love of dance and her love of Crastor, ultimately driving her to an attempt at suicide. There is a lovely scene directly afterwards where ""The Red Shoes"" is performed with everyone except Page as a tribute to her. It's moments like these that really separate good films from great ones - that image of the empty spotlight on stage packs an emotional punch which is very memorable and greatly reinforces of the themes at hand.

Honestly, I thought the whole latter section of the movie was handled very well. I could definitely sense a theme of paternalism, which makes a lot of sense given the time period during which this film was made. After deciding to forgo dance and marrying Crastor, his career flourishes and she starts to live in his shadow - a ""housewife"", as Lermontov so eloquently puts it. There is some good commentary here on women's role in society at that time and how that ran contrary to their ambitions and visions for themselves. There is also a nice amount of depth to the character of Lermontov which reveals itself at this point. You begin to wonder if his displeasure with Page's marriage is purely due to his ideals about dance, or if he is driven by jealousy of their love which he has never allowed himself to experience in his own life. From what I could tell on a first viewing, it is left relatively ambiguous whether he actually has feelings for Page, or if he simply is jealous that they have something he doesn't. Even a further wrinkle here is that perhaps he is jealous of their raw talent as artists. Although he is a great coordinator and director of his ballet, during the actual performance he is ultimately relegated to the stands where he must sit and watch, but never participate. He may very well yearn for their talent which he doesn't possess himself.

I really did enjoy this move quite a lot. It was an excellent exploration of this theme of sacrifice for art, and this is probably one of the first movies to really explore it in such depth. I will say that the dream-like ballet performance midway through the film is the true climax and pinnacle of what the film accomplishes, and the unfortunate result is that the more dramatic and realistic tone of the rest of the movie left me wishing for more abstraction. Also, the fact that the climax occurs midway through the film does take the wind out of the sails a bit for the rest, no matter how well it is handled and executed (which is very well). The very end of the movie is also climactic, but it doesn't really reach the heights of the full ballet sequence. In any case, this is still an excellent film from beginning to end and definitely leaves you with plenty to ponder about artistic pursuit and sacrifice.",1460592000,,5474,4.748685594111461

267282,5,6300217728,"The more mediocre reviews of this film by Amazon reviewers that I have read seem to focus on the length and that it is ""hard to follow.""  It seems that those reactions stem from current movie-watching habits that have been shaped by contemporary filmmakers who favor fast-paced, shallow stories.  A little bit of patience and the sense that you are watching an artifact from a different place and time, as well as the sense that you are seeing the inner world of a ballet company and the inner world of several artists creating might help you feel more comfortable watching this film.  This film has a lot in common with the contemporary film ""Whiplash,"" for which it seems like it was an inspiration.

As a dancer, I think that this movie captures perfectly the way dance becomes a passion -- something that you live for thought it consumes you like fire.  As a filmgoer, I believe that this movie more successfully than so many others -- ""The Turning Point,"" ""Black Swan,"" etc., -- makes ballet a cinematic form.  ""The Ballet of the Red Shoes"" was made specifically for the camera and cannot be performed on stage so it does things that the two art forms together can only produce.  In doing so, it captures the inner life and fantasy of the dancer in such a way that you have no idea what she is ""actually"" dancing for the fictional audience, but that you get a ballet that matches the rest of the film's themes perfectly.  Though I have only read descriptions of ""L'apres midi d'un faun,"" it seems to me that ""The Ballet of the Red Shoes"" telegraphs the same introversion that ""L'apre midi d'un faun"" might have tried to show:  the dancer, dancing for herself/himself, because it is the dance that she/he lives for, not the audience.",1428105600,12,1737,4.613636363636363

267532,5,6300217728,"Even after sixty-five years, THE RED SHOES remains compelling viewing.  Based on the Hans Christian Andersen story, it is a study in obsession; the obsession of the Svengali-like Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) for his prima ballerinas, and the parallel obsession of dancer Victoria Page (Moira Shearer) to reach the top of her profession.  Both characters are driven to extremes by their desires: Lermontov pushes his dancers beyond endurance, while Victoria ends up committing suicide.  Technically speaking, THE RED SHOES is quite brilliant: Jack Cardiff's Technicolor photography consistently juxtaposes picture-postcard locations (in Monte Carlo and post-war London) with deliberately disconcerting shots, where the characters are photographed from disconcerting angles.  We have to admire Powell and Pressburger's boldness in including a lengthy dance-sequence that rehearses the film's entire plot, and then photographing it in such a way as to emphasize the sheer strain for everyone involved, both on and off the stage.  Some of the sequences are, quite simply, brilliant - for example, the point-of-view sequence where Victoria imagines the world around her moving round and round, faster and faster, as if she were caught on a roundabout and unable to get off.  THE RED SHOES deserves repeated viewings, if only to understand just how brilliant the film is.",1386460800,2,1369,5.5893719806763285

I notice that there are many shots where there is a green tint on the right side and a more natural rendition on the left.

The colors are wonderfully clear and balanced and the whole film seems to be fresh and new. This makes the story shine in its eternal truth. Lermontov, the ruthless perfectionist, who cares about ballet more than about life - not only his own but also his troupe's, Victoria Page, whose life is tragically taken over by Andersen's fairy tale of the ""Red Shoes"", Craster, the composer, who is the living link between art and human life.

Fun to see the actual post WW2 Russian ballet greats perform and act in this movie.  There was a youthful  exhuberance in post WW2 England and France that permeates this movie.  Last but not least, the clothes are divine!  The actors wear exquisite French classic designer fashions from Dior, Fath and Carven.

267538,5,6300217728,"I saw this artistic ballet film over 40 years ago. It was the finest and strangest film ever produced about the fine art of ballet. There is so much here to examine regarding what the writers were saying to their viewers. First I saw that when one worships idols such as the arts and artists, that person is in immediate trouble. Boris Lermontov was that sort of man. He filled his world with people so as to use them and exploit them for his own purposes. He tried to force them live up to standards he himself was not able or willing to do live up to himself as ballet was his religion. His idol. The dance segment is really superb. The acting is equally so. I admire this movie but I had to give up watching it. It began to warp my thinking which is what it was designed to do. Many of the movies from this industry were and are created to shape our thinking and cause us to want to do things we would not ordinarily do. They make us want things that we wouldn't ordinarily want. It is a propaganda piece. And that is coming back on us today in full force. There is glaring vice in this film that staggers the imagination. The ending was still shocking to me. However, after watching it so many times, I became to become dulled to the act of suicide which is not a natural act. It is murder. I would not recommend this to children or to the emotionally sensitive. It is strange and wonderful at the same time. Moora Shearer was such a special lady and so very gorgeous. Marius Goring as Julian was a grand actor but Anton Walbrook stole the show. I liked the dancers Ivan and Grisha and Sergei Ratov was the stage artist. All were suberb in their roles. I just wish they had not had her die in the end. It was all to real for a so-called fairy tale without a happy ending. Really sad!",1374883200,4,1787,4.1976744186046515

The message this movie portrays is priceless and I will remember this one for a long time, I would watch again if I had the time.

267655,5,6300217728,"The Red Shoes (1948 England) starring Moira Shearer and Anton Walbrook Is About Sergei Diaghilev (1872 Russia - 1929 Italy).

The Red Shoes (1948 England) starring Moira Shearer and Anton Walbrook is beyond question the most important and well done dance movie in the history of cinema. No other movie comes close.

The highlight of the movie, of course, is the 18 minute ""Ballet Of The Red Shoes"" danced brilliantly by the incredible (and incredibly physically beautiful) Moira Shearer (1926 - 2006...died at age 80...22 years old in 1948).

Male supporting dancers Robert Helpmann (who also choreographed the wonderful RED SHOES BALLET) and Leonide Massine made the then (1948) groundbreaking ""Ballet Of The Red Shoes"" wonderful in every way.

What's interesting is that, even though most people rightly associate this movie with the lovely and talented Moira Shearer and her dazzling red hair, and remember the ""Ballet Of The Red Shoes"" (all quite justified), the movie is actually about the character in the story who plays the Impresario (Executive Producer) of the ballet which is showcased in The Red Shoes (1948 England).

Anton Walbrook was 53 when he played the role of ""Boris Lermontov,"" owner and main mover and shaker of the ""Ballet Lermontov"" headquartered in Monte Carlo, located on the French ""Cote D'Azure"" (aka the French ""Riviera."") The Boris Lermontov character is a fictionalized depiction of the incredible, famous, and notorious Sergei Diaghilev (1872 Russia - 1929 Italy) who invented the concept of the modern professional ballet company owned privately with his ""Ballet Russes"" organization, started in his native (then Czarist) Russia in 1909 and transported permanently to Paris, France and then Monte Carlo starting in 1917, after which Diaghilev never returned to Russia (the new Russian Communist government didn't approve of private companies like the Ballet Russes).

Diaghilev was trained as lawyer in late 19th century Czarist Russia, then became an arts magazine manager, and in his 30's an Impresario for a traveling Russian opera which took him to Paris and major European capitals in pre-WWI Europe.

Before him, ballet had never been self-standing. It was always part of opera companies or part of European royal courts.

Any person interested in The Red Shoes (1948 England) should read biographies of Sergei Diaghilev (see the Wikipedia biography profile of Diaghilev) and also read without fail Reading Dance by Robert Gottlieb (2008 Pantheon Books, New York) which provides wonderful detailed accounts of Diaghilev and his life, the making of the Red Shoes (1948) movie essay by Michael Powell, and life and dance profiles of both major male dancers in the movie, Robert Helpmann (who also choreographed the RED SHOES BALLET) and Leonide Massine.

The Red Shoes (1948 England) starring Moira Shearer is not only a high water mark dance movie in world cinema history, it was and is a major event in the history of world culture past and present.

All this said, it is also true that the movie is edifying and pleasant to watch for only the first third of it.

The best part of the movie is the first third only, during which the viewer is introduced to the exotic and charming world and politics of big time ballet in western Europe, and sees the interesting people, the lovely costumes and settings where they work and play, and is shown the entire ""Red Shoes Ballet"" which is presented early in the movie, rather than at the end when traditional ""show stopper"" dance numbers are usually presented.

After the female star is introduced and wins the role of main dancer in the main ballet of the movie, things change.

The movie gets worse, and though it has interesting moments and events thereafter, the best part of the movie ends when the Red Shoes Ballet ends.

The movie stops being lovely (which is why it's famous), and starts being quite ugly and sad, right up to the end of the movie, when the beautiful dancer who has the main role commits suicide.

A grim ending to a movie lovely to start with, but which changes after the main ballet presentation is offered. We see things get ugly, and they don't change until the end of the movie.

Other movies of fame have the same problem. We are shown an interesting, lovely setting and world and equally lovely and interesting characters.....we visit their world.

Then, a downward turn in the plot kicks in, and the viewer is dragged through it.

It is arguable that movies like the RED SHOES (1948) should be seen only in part, and that the last part be avoided when repeat viewings occur.

Movies, after all, are made up of fragments and sequences connected (""glued"") together, one after another. The best sequences almost always come early.

Viewers should be realistic about that, and defend themselves when necessary.

267673,5,6300217728,"I'm not into ballet, but I love musicals. This film I love very much precisely because of its music. And yet, the plot was also enticing.  There is Vicky Page, a ballerina who must dance for its own sake; Lermontov, a producer of ballet whom considers the art of dancing a religion, and Julian Craster, a talented composer. Miss Page and Mr. Craster end up working for Lermontov because of their talents. The three are able to produce ""The Red Shoes,"" which becomes a success with the public. With this ballet production, Lermontov is more than convinced that Miss Page will be.a success and a great dancer, but at the same time, Vicky and Julian become in love, something that Lermontov considers destructive to the art of dancing. By the way, the story of ""The Red Shoes"" by Hans Christian Andersen, is about a ballerina who wears magical red shoes for a ball, and after the ball is over, she cannot take them off. So, she keeps dancing until she dies, never being able to free herself from them. Something similar happens in this movie. Vicky plays the role of the victim from the fairy tale as her love for Julian collides with Lermontov's artistic dogmatism. Two views of art collide: Craster's view that art is an inspiration provided by human experience, and Lermontov's view that art is above human experience and human nature, something that must be ignored. The ending is as tragic as the fairy tale, but it is a beautiful tragedy to be remembered (like Romeo and Juliet).

This film is also beautifully restored, and I strongly believe that even if you are not a ballet fan, you will enjoy every minute of this film, including the 15 or 20 minutes of the presentation of the ballet ""The Red Shoes.""",1330819200,12,1709,4.636963696369637

I can't recall another movie that essentially stops in the middle to show a nearly full ballet, or at least an act.

In life, it is also a metaphor for our ballerina and her composer husband.  Does she stick with him or further her career with the nasty old impresario Boris?

I had a chance to see a 35mm screening of ""The Red Shoes"" again with my teenage daughter in January, 2012. She expressed similar sentiments but I found that I liked the movie a lot more on second viewing. I found the character's actions credible in trying to accomplish their goals through much of the film and some fairly subtle but clear and amusing reactions from some of the actors (who are mostly very, very good).

I found myself watching for the moment where it turns and loses my buy-in to their situation.

Prior to this, I've never heard of it but after hearing and reading a lot of praise, I decided to buy it. I have to say that experiencing The Red Shoes is a completely marvelous experience. The dilemma of a ballerina torn between her passion for dancing and her love for a man is so enthralling, so absorbent that you can't look away. The color in the picture done by the great Jack Cardiff is simply amazing.

The Archers did a picture about passion. The passion for art and this passion comes at a cost. If you want it, you'll have to dismiss everything else from your life. This powerful drama is aided by a wonderful set decoration and most of all, a spectacular and surreal ballet sequence of The Red Shoes. This is one of the many highlights of the film and is simply amazing. Most of the actors were ballet dancers which gives the movie a much more realistic tone. The performances are wonderful especially Anton Walbrook and Moira Shearer that truly shine in their respective roles. The Red Shoes is without a doubt the best ""Ballet"" movie but it's something much more that elevates its status as a timeless classic.

Video & Audio:
This is my first Criterion title and I was blown away by the results. The restoration of the film is simply breathtaking, the colors are so vivid, deatil is clear and the transfer is immaculate without compression artifacts whatsoever. A triumphant transfer through and through.

The uncompressed monoaural soundtrack is equally pleasing with clear dialogue and music and without any craks or distortions. Excellent.

Bonus Features:
This Criterion BD comes with a lot of bonus material that includes an audiocommentary with film scholars and the film cast and crew, a restorarion demonstration with Martin Scorsese in which he explains the process of restoring the picture and we are treated to a ""before"" and ""after"" comparison. This will make you appreciate the hard effort of all the people involved in the restoration to restore the film beyond its former glory. ""A Profile of The Red Shoes"" which is an informative making of documentary, a wonderful interview with Thelma Schoonmaker Powell, Michael Powell's widow and Martin Scorsese editor. Also you have sketches of the ballet sequence that can be watched alongside the reading of the original fairy tale by Jeremy Irons. In addition you have galleries and the theatrical trailer. Also a reading of Jeremy Irons of the novelization of the film and a booklet with an essay by critic David Ehrenstein and a report of the wonderful restoration.

Closing Thoughts:

So my five star would be right in line with all people who understand GREAT CLassic CINEMA, It's fantastic and not boring in the least. But they really restored this one to perfection, hell even alot of modern movies on blu ray aren't restored enough to suite my tastes , but this one looks better than alot of modern movies. And unlike other restored films they used several type of prints to come up with this flawless print. I wish lets say 'stagecoach' was this restored , they still cleaned it up alot but I would rather them fully restore it even if I notice it than have lines in it. I bought that one though and it's better than most editions by far. This one is looks like I want all older movies to look like fantastic. The story is great too and I can say that this movie had alot of influence and not just on 'the black swan' a modern movie about ballet I enjoyed immensely as well.  (it won best actress , this movies lead deserved one as well) Anyways this is a great movie that real lovers of cinema (not just movies should see in blu) and it has no negativ reviews unless one of amazons one star reviewers watch it.

267758,5,6300217728,"This restored and remastered version is miraculous. Once more we can see the brilliant, jewel-like, fully saturated colours that us oldies remember as typical of the original Technicolor process. The restorers, bless them, have, for once, paid equal attention to the sound, so often forgotten by classic film restorers. In this case, the sound is better than in any previous version, including the original. Even if, like me, you have an existing DVD (or VHS tape) of Red Shoes, I urge you to buy this one - you will be bowled over by the quality of image and sound and will want to keep it for watching again and again.

This extraordinary movie has been watched all over the world throughout the sixty-three years since it was made. Probably no day passes without it being shown somewhere in the world. I doubt these statements are true of any other movie except, perhaps, 'Casablanca'. Moreover, many of the people that love it don't particularly like ballet. Some actively dislike classical ballet. How can this be?

It is so successful because the directors pull so many of the arts together in one construct, each and all of them to an unsurpassed standard. Composer, musicians, choreographer, dancers, actors, stage designers, painters, lighting designers, studio technicians, cinematographer - all gave of their transcendent best to tell a universally well-loved, traditional folk-tale, related by one of the greatest storytellers of all time and to interpret it as a ten-hankie, love-story movie.

It is invidious to pick individuals out of this magnificent joint effort, but two artists in particular should be noted, as they always get left out of other reviews, upstaged by the more obvious talents of Walbrook, Shearer and Massine, who each grab your attention whenever they are on screen.

First, and perhaps greatest of the lot, Jack Cardiff for his brilliant, innovative camera-work and Technicolor cinematography, especially because these were the early days of Technicolor and he, a hitherto unknown Brit cameraman, introduced, for the first time, a painterly eye which amazed the American Technicolor technicians. His extraordinary creative and innovative camerawork for the ballet within the film has never been equalled.

Second, Brian Easdale's music never gets proper credit, probably because the Red Shoes' sprightly theme is lifted directly from Elgar's 1901 'Cockaigne' overture. The music is no worse for that, as Easdale creates his own evocative variations with brilliant development and orchestration, precisely reflecting the style typical of contemporary English ballet music in the middle of the 20th century. Exciting, emotional, highly rhythmic, eminently danceable ballet music, perfectly interpreting the subject.

Moira Shearer (already a well-known prima ballerina and at the peak of her powers on the classical ballet stage at the time) was famed for the unrivalled precision of her dancing. She not only entrances us with her blazing talent and the ravishing beauty of her gorgeous combination of red hair and creamy skin, but shows that she is no mean actor. At a (much) lower level, she reduces males to blubber with the shot of her pert bottom in little black dance shorts as she walks towards the exercise barre. Wow!

Reviews which dismiss the script as trite, to my mind, miss the whole point of the story. The ballerina's predicament is anything but ""trite"". The conflict between the demands of career and relationship is something most of us experience - more and more - in our everyday lives.  Highly talented and dedicated artists, for whom their art is their life, find that a satisfactory solution to the dilemma is simply unattainable. The ending of 'The Red Shoes' may be ""over-the-top"" compared to real life, but this is ART - a legend - for heaven's sake. Like a Greek tragedy, it deliberately uses catastrophe to dramatise the unhappiness, possibly disaster, that results from attempts to resolve this impossible dilemma.

This is without doubt the best movie about ballet ever made and by any standard one of the best movies of all time. Even if you do not like ballet, you must see it once. If you like ballet, I promise you will see it many times.

I saw 'The Red Shoes' when it first appeared in 1948, when I was a boy of sixteen and head-over-heels in love with my own real-life, beautiful young ballerina. Which is, of course, why I have seen it several times a year ever since, will continue to watch it until I make my own final exit, stage right, and will never accept any criticism of it whatsoever. And that driven bastard Lermontov is, unfortunately, only too right when he says in the movie - ""NOTHING...matters...but...the...music."" As I was to learn the hard way, even the deepest emotions are only too transitory, while great art lives for ever. The human drama of how this plays out in the story of the Red Shoes is what makes it a great film. No great art gets made without enormous human sacrifice. Ever.

Since writing a rave review of this film several years ago I have read that Martin Scorsese has said that 'The Red Shoes' is the single most powerful cinematic influence on his work and that he recognises some part of its influence on him every day. I confess to a rosy glow of insufferable self-satisfaction when I first read this - ""I told you so!"".

267789,5,6300217728,"The Red Shoes has been painstakingly restored over the course of two-and-a-half years where it was finally unveiled at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. It's safe to say the film has never looked or sounded better. One of the true classics of cinema has been preserved for future generations to study and enjoy. For a landmark film such as The Red Shoes, the Criterion Collection has gone that extra mile in the extras department.

The first disc features a ""Restoration Demonstration"" as Martin Scorsese takes us briefly through the process of restoring The Red Shoes and just how challenging it was to do. He shows a clip from the damaged original and how it was restored digitally. The restorers did an amazing job on this film and the proof is in the final results.

There is an audio commentary by film historian Ian Christie and interviews with stars Marius Goring and Moira Shearer, cinematographer Jack Cardiff, composer Brian Easdale, and Scorsese. The veteran director talks about the use of colour and how it drew him to the film. Cardiff talks about how he got involved. Initially, he hated the ballet but soon grew to love it. Goring talks about the blend of fairy tale and reality in the film. Unlike Cardiff, Easdale was a long-time fan of the ballet and speaks of the origins of the music. Shearer says that she took some convincing because she was enjoying a successful run as a dancer and found the film's script dreadful. This is an excellent track that covers all aspects of The Red Shoes.

""The Red Shoes Novel"" features actor Jeremy Irons reading excerpts from the 1978 novelization of the film as you're watching it. He has a great voice which really enhances the prose.

Also included is a theatrical trailer.

The second disc starts off with ""Profile of The Red Shoes,"" a 25-minute retrospective documentary. It starts off giving some background to the genesis of the film and takes us through its production with surviving crew members sharing their memories and relatives of those who died recounting stories as well. This is an excellent look at how The Red Shoes was made.

Legendary film editor Thelma Schoonmaker is interviewed at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. She had been married to Michael Powell from 1984 until his death in 1990. She talks about the film's restoration and also comments on what the film means to her. She speaks quite eloquently and very knowledgeably.

Also included are six stills galleries covering the cast and crew, behind-the-scenes in London, Paris and Monte Carlo, deleted scenes, and production and costume designs.

""Scorsese's Memorabilia"" is a gallery of items from the filmmaker's personal collection. It's quite impressive with things like the red ballet shoes worn by Shearer in the film, and posters and lobby cards from various countries.

Finally, there is ""The Red Shoes Sketches,"" a collection of production designer Hein Heckroth's original colour storyboards animated and set to Brian Easdale's score. You can view them on their own or as a side-by-side comparison to The Red Shoes ballet as seen in the film with an optional audio track of Jeremy Irons reading excerpts of the original Hans Christian Andersen story.",1279152000,10,3190,4.936567164179104

267791,5,6300217728,"I'll admit that when `The Red Shoes' began I was nervous.  I am not the greatest fan of the ballet and I've seen other films concerning this subject and felt seriously underwhelmed, even frustrated (`The Turning Point' for one).  In fact, the only reason I stuck to my guns and actually turned this film on was because Martin Scorsese has claimed this to be one of his favorite films ever made.  When a respected and talented artist makes a claim like that, it's worth checking out.  As the film started I was finding myself anxious.  It wasn't grabbing me like I wanted it to.  It was just there and I was just there and I was seriously afraid that I was going to turn it off.

But then something happened.

`The Red Shoes' begins with a blatant form of plagiarism that, when exposed, garners the victim (a young composer named Julian Craster) a job working for Boris Lermontov, the owner of a prestige ballet company.  Julian is given the task of re-scoring a production of `The Red Shoes', a beautifully tragic ballet that will star a `star in the making'.  That young star is Victoria Page, an aspiring dancer whose talent catches Boris's eye long enough for him to place great responsibility on her shoulders.  What starts out as a great opportunity for both Victoria and Julian soon becomes something more treacherous as they realize that Boris expects a great deal from them; he expects their souls.

The ballet performed in the film (`The Red Shoes') serves as a beautiful comparison piece to the real life drama unfolding behind the scenes, as Victoria is pinned between her romance with Julian and her unwavering devotion to her craft.  The ballet tells the story of a young woman who wants to wear a pair of red shoes to a dance only to discover that the shoes themselves are cursed and will not allow her to stop dancing.  She then dies.  This moral applies to all three of the film's main characters in different ways.  For Victoria, and to a lesser degree Julian, the shoes represent her desire to dance.  Once she has attained her dream she realizes that it is pulling her away from her life and will not allow her to walk away.  For Boris, the shoes represent something more; they represent his desire to live.  Boris, the perfectionist, distances himself from carnal happiness because he will not allow anything to interfere with his profession.  He demands this from his dancers because he does not want to see his dream dissolved by their happiness.  When he begins to entertain the idea of love with Victoria he finds that his desire is demolished by her apparent affections for Julian.  His fantasy of life with her is represented by the red shoes, something that he can not let go of; even if it kills him.

Or her.

The film is a visual feast.  The dramatic close ups and lavish sets are just stunning.  The films overall construction is something to awe over.  What I appreciated was that the film did not merely consist of interpretive dance after interpretive dance but instead it added many meaty layers to the film's structure.  The dancing that is shown here is poignant and powerful, the ballet `The Red Shoes' itself being one of the most beautifully shot sequences in all of cinema.  What is so lovely about the production of that particular dance is that it brilliantly shows how this heartfelt ballet becomes a dreamlike representation of Victoria's own predicament.  As Julian asks her before she dances; ""what will you be thinking about?""

She shows us her soul.

Performance wise, this is a masterclass.  The three leads are all award worthy, especially Anton Walbrook, who manages to illuminate every aspect of Boris's personality.  He becomes a very sympathetic `villain' so-to-speak; someone relatable and understandable.  Moira Shearer is simply glorious and Marius Goring holds his own effortlessly as the lovestruck Julian, trying to hold onto his future.

After soaking this film in I can honestly say that I agree with Scorsese 100%!",1274227200,7,3978,4.764619883040936
267792,5,6300217728,"Having had the extreme pleasure of seeing the restored print of Red Shoes at the George Eastman House's Dryden Theater on May 8, I can't help myself from jotting a few notes on a product 2 months before it's release.
 ""The Red Shoes"" in any other hands besides The Archers would be a late 40's English melodrama and available on DVD in one of those 50 movies for $10 box sets. However, bring in Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger, Jack Cardiff and Hein Heckroth, among many others, and the result is of of the great examples of cinema as art.
 To call this a ""Ballet Film"" is almost an injustice, for while ballet is the genre used, ""Red Shoes"" is as much about creative process as it is about dance. Two young idealistic protagonists jump in full of blind enthusiasm only to find out that true artistry begins in the lower depths of obscurity - day after day after day of hard slavish work. The few who do rise in the ranks get more work, and the emotional high of public ovations lasts for a fleeting moment, then back to the depths for more work.
 It is also a fantasy film, not so much for the Red Shoes ballet-fantasy itself, but also because the entire film is unrealistic as far as how the real world of artistry works. The emphasis is not on realism (although Covent Garden, the Paris Opera and the Mercury Theater were all used as location shots), but on the emotion of working to the top of the world, and the price of staying there.
 The cast is wonderful, and Moira Shearer looks absolutely stunning in Technicolor! From her first moment of star-struck naivety in her aunt's box in Covent Garden, to her ravaged sensuality at the end of her performance in ""The Red Shoes"" ballet performance, and finally her last scene as a broken ""Coppelia"" figurine in a tug of war between Lermentov and Craster, Shearer is captivating to see.
 The great Anton Walbrook plays Boris Lermentov, an aristocratic impresario who has the power to raise people to dizzying artistic heights, and also to destroy them in an instant. Walbrook is one of the few actors who can act with his eyes, showing incredible warmth and humanity or cold sadistic cruelty with a single glance, and he uses them effectively in one of Martin Scorsese's favorite villain roles. Walbrook is perfect as Lermentov ranging from cold aloofness as a perfectionist, inhuman as he tosses artists to the wayside, tender and paternal in ""adopting"" Vicky page, and exhilarating in his demonic obsession which destroys both Page and himself.
 Jack Cardiff, one of the great Technicolor cinematographers, belongs in the opening credits for one of the great film achievements of all time. Of course, Vicky Page's Red Shoes Ballet is stunning and remains the centerpiece of the film, but the small moments are just as impressive. The texture on clothing, curtains and upholstery is so vivid you can almost feel them! Then there are the contrasts as in the Paris scenes, first in the Paris Opera's Foyer de la Danse with warm suffused lighting followed by the cold harsh Vermeer-like brooding of Lermentov's office, or the opulance of Lady Neston's party against the drab and even shabby exercise rooms.
 The entire cast is very good, each one memorable no matter how small the role.
 The real stars of this film are The Archers, who may be one of the greatest production teams in the history of cinema. While Michael Powell was the director and had final say in everything, this production is a collaboration of some of the finest artists around at the time, each one having some say in the entire production, and not just in their credited departments.
 The new print itself is absolutely gorgeous and stunning to look at! I had seen Red Shoes on the old Criterion version a number of times before the Eastman House screening (with Thelma Schoonmaker in attendance), and to tell the truth, I was so caught up in the emotion of the film to fully appreciate the restoration until several days later when I took another look at the old Criterion and was surprised at how pale and pockmarked it looked compared to the new print.
Ms. Schoonmaker showed some demos of the restoration process, which I assume will be part of the new Criterion with Scorsese making comments, and the amount of labor it took to restore three-strip Technicolor frame by frame (500,000 feet of film). From the opening J. Arthur Rank/Archers logos to the devastating final reel of emotions spinning out of control, the ""new"" Red Shoes is a release that will belong on the top of any true film lovers list.",1273881600,5,4533,4.698992443324937

267828,5,6300217728,"The Russian ballet has come to town and due to circumstance; a student Julian Craster (Marius Goring) becomes a brilliant composer. An orphan Victoria Page (Moira Shearer) protected by a patron of the arts has an opportunity to become a great dancer.  Neither the composer nor the dancer wants anything more. Together under the direction of the company owner Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook), they create the perfect ballet ""The Red Shoes"".

The story of the ballet is base on a story of Hans Christian Anderson.  It is about a girl infatuated with a par of dancing shoes. She places them on her feet. Moreover, begins dancing. When she tires, the shoes insist on dancing g and do so through time until her demise. You will find that there is more depth to the story than just a real life reflection of Anderson's story.

The only requirement of the company owner is that everyone focuses on their career and not fall in love. When the ballerina and the composer do just that, it raises the ire of the company owner. He forms a scheme to what end?

This film is an Archer film and holds true to the quality and entertainment value.  I suggest you watch the Criterion version. There is a 19194 voice over commentary, by film historian Ian Christie with interviews of Marius Goring, Moira shearer, Jack Cardiff, Brian Easdale, and Martin Scorsese.

There is also a voice over reading of the Powell and Pressburger novelization of ""The Red Shoes"".

The Criterion version did not clean up all the film scratches. If this hits Blu-ray, I hope they will leave in all the criterion extras but clean up the scratches.

There is an audacious surrealism that courses through the film, but the Archers don't lose sight of the love story at its core. Ballet enthusiasts have sung this film's praises for over six decades now, but there is much more to appreciate here.

After showing a horde of youngsters flooding the balcony of the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden for a ballet performance, the filmmakers settle their story on Victoria ""Vicky"" Page, an aspiring prima ballerina who comes from a wealthy London family and catches the attention of impresario Boris Lermontov. When his star dancer Irina Boronskaja decides to get married, Lermontov concludes she has forsaken her art and gives Vicky a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity in the company's newest ballet, a fantasy piece based on Andersen's ""The Red Shoes"". Under Lermontov's unyielding tutelage, she learns the role of a young girl cursed to dance herself to death in a magical pair of red slippers. At the same time, prodigiously talented composer Julian Quentin, another of Lermontov's protgs, is completing the score for the ballet and unsurprisingly falls in love with Vicky. Despite the success of the ballet at its premiere in Monte Carlo, Lermontov forces Vicky to decide between her career and her pending marriage to Julian. The mounting pressure of the decision overwhelms Vicky and forces her to face unforeseen consequences.

All of 21 when she was cast, Moira Shearer is ideal as Vicky, as she is not only a striking, flame-haired beauty but an accomplished ballerina and an affecting actress. Despite a flood of offers after the film's release, she never made as significant an impression in her career, and the film itself would not be nearly as magnetic without her presence. She is showcased brilliantly in the mesmerizing fifteen-minute ballet sequence that is said to have inspired Gene Kelly to produce his magnificent ballet piece in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-American-in-Paris/dp/B001BHI0JE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An American in Paris</a>. ""The Red Shoes"" ballet is boldly imaginative in its expressionistic visuals and the dream-like state in which Shearer dances to Brian Easdale's majestic score and Robert Helpmann's dramatic choreography. Pulling at Vicki in opposite directions, the two male leads perform admirably within the confines of their stereotypical roles - Marius Goring as the brilliant yet petulant Julian and especially Anton Walbrook who does a Barrymore-level turn as the tyrannical, smitten Lermontov (take note of the fastidious brocade robe he wears in an early morning scene). Major credit also needs to go to cinematographer Jack Cardiff, who did similarly impressive work in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Narcissus/dp/B00004XQN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Narcissus</a>&nbsp;and later became a director himself (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sons-Lovers/dp/B000MR9C4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sons & Lovers</a>).

There are also slides of ardent fan Martin Scorsese's collection of ""Red Shoes"" memorabilia; publicity and behind-the-scenes production stills; and film clips and stills from the Archers' illustrious filmography. Particularly fascinating is ""The Red Shoes Sketches"", an animated film of Hein Heckroth's painted storyboards set to ""The Red Shoes"" ballet. The commentary track is the best feature even if it is a bit of hodgepodge with clips of audio interviews with Cardiff, Shearer, Goring, composer Brian Tisdale, and Scorsese. British film historian Ian Christie leads an entertaining discussion of the movie's development and production with Shearer surprisingly candid about the challenges in making the film.

267868,4,6300217728,"A great many people--including Martin Scosese--have stated that seeing THE RED SHOES fueled their desire for a career in the arts, and over the years the film has acquired quasi-legendary status as an intellectually profound, emotionally stirring motion picture that investigates the deep personal sacrifices a career in the arts requires. But while I found the film visually stunning and interesting in concept, I also found it simplistic in its statements on the nature of art and nothing short of trivial melodrama in terms of plot.

Very loosely based on the goings-on in the famous Serge Diaghilev ballet company, the film concerns a rising dancer (Moira Shearer) and rising composer (Marius Goring) who fall under the spell of an inflexible impressario (Anton Walbrook), who leads them to create a new ballet: The Red Shoes, based on the famous Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale. The ballet turns both dancer and composer into stars--but so far as the impressario is concerned art leaves no room for human affection, and when the dancer falls in love with the composer professional and personal tragedy is the result.

THE RED SHOES is particularly famous for its portrait of backstage life and the fifteen-minute ""Ballet of the Red Shoes"" sequence, which was the first of its kind in a major motion picture. Moira Shearer, who was a major dancer at the time of the film, is more of a dancer than an actor, but she carries the demands of the script very well. The remaining cast, however, overplays shamelessly, and when combined with the trivial plot and equally trivial script--well, let's just say that the whole thing acquires a slightly ripe quality and it is difficult to feel a great deal of interest in the characters or their personal difficulties.

Even so, THE RED SHOES is nothing short of visually stunning. It is easily among the finest Technicolor films made, and the attention to design detail is elegant, beautiful, and imaginative. Although certain camera techniques have dated poorly, the ""Ballet of the Red Shoes"" is indeed worthy of its fame, and Shearer is exceptionally attractive in her screen debut. The Criterion DVD presents the film in near-pristine condition with a truly memorable audio commentary. Recommmended, but don't expect too much in terms of depth.

267870,5,6300217728,"The beautiful cinematography of The Red Shoes mirrors the fairy tale quality of Hans Christian Andersen's story about a woman who is dedicated to ballet, a young composer who loves the dancer, and a dictator of a director who would control the young dancer's life.

The director not only directs the ballet, he directs every detail of the dancer's life, even demanding that she give up her relationship with the composer. Despite his dictates, she runs off and marries her lover but is lured back ultimately to dance once more, and the ballet is called ""The Red Shoes.""

As the tension between the composer and the director escalates, the dancer finds herself torn between dance and her husband. She is unable to give up either one and her indecision causes greater problems, making her husband leave.

The director demands that she dance ""like never before,"" but ultimately she commits suicide. As she is dying in the arms of her distraught husband, she begs him to take off the red shoes. Unbelievably, the director chooses to do the ballet once more because his dancer ""would have wanted it."" What follows is a production that is easily the most beautiful piece of British cinema in history, showing how the story of the dead dancer mirrors the story of the girl in Andersen's fairy tale.

267871,5,6300217728,"Although it has dated culturally in some ways (even the most dedicated ballet dancers no longer have to choose between dancing and living), ""The Red Shoes"" remains one of the most magical films ever made.  The film was inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen story of the same name, and recounts the tragedy of a rising ballet star caught between young love and the demands of an obsessed and possessive impresario.  It is one of the most beautiful of all technicolor films, the process fully serving a gorgeous production that is meant to suggest a fairy tale, as well as the luminous red-haired beauty of its young star.  This is a ""backstage"" dance movie that works on multiple levels, including the parallel between the original Andersen story and the plot.  It features performances by actors and dancers whose names are now the stuff of legend: a young Moira Shearer as Victoria Page; Marius Goring as Julian Craster, the young composer; Anton Wolbrook as Boris Lermontov, the impresario; and Robert Helpmann and Leonide Massine as leading dancers of the ballet company.

First among equals here is Anton Wolbrook, whose performance as Boris Lermontov, the impresario who raises Page to stardom and then destroys her with his possessiveness, is so finely nuanced that it nearly breaks through the fairy-tale conceit imposed upon the film and the other performances.  It is one of the most wonderful film performances by an actor I have ever seen.  While the rest of the cast inhabit their roles beautifully, those roles have an unreal quality that dovetails with the intentionally storybook feel of the film. Wolbrook's performance alone transcends that quality, and delivers a flesh and blood portrayal of a ""real"" character - it is a measure of Wolbrook's immense talent that he does so without throwing the film off balance.

The actual ballet performance is a record of Shearer's very real gifts as a dancer, as well as of the stage presences of the formidable Messrs. Helpmann and Massine (the late Dame Margot Fonteyn once said that to share a stage with Robert Helpmann was ""to learn in a very hard school"").  The score by Brian Easdale is enchanting, and the look of the film, costumes, and scenes set in London, Monte Carlo, and the Riviera, is luscious.  Sentimental, yes; somewhat dated, yes; but for all that the film is a must-have of this genre for its ravishing beauty, and its record of outstanding performers at the height of their powers.",1200960000,22,2462,4.910843373493976

The film ""leaves"" the stage, and we get a beautiful, emotional, poetic interpretation of The Red Shoes.  It's almost like it's own little movie.  Certain films like this can't really be described to anyone's satisfaction, as they inspire many emotions and feeling, and words cannot convey these things most of the time.  The film is so beguiling and beautiful that it still inspires many filmmakers, dancers, musicians, and artists to this very day.  One of my favorite exchanges of dialogue sums up this film....

Moira Shearer Glows, as Victoria Page. who wants nothing more in life then to dance, and never even considered love until... I'm telling you it's like you have to watch her. Her performance is hypnotic. She makes the film worth watching all by herself.

267919,4,6300217728,"""The Red Shoes"" (1948) is a fantasy/musical/romance/drama set in the world of ballet and it could be possibly the best or one of the best ballet movies ever filmed. The red shoes of the title are from Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale about a girl who tried the shoes on and possessed by their spell, dances to her death. The shoes gave her dance unearthly ethereal lightness and elegance and she paid with her own life for them. Andersen's fairy tale was transformed into a ballet in Michael Powell's and Emeric Pressburger's glorious film. 21-year-old Moira Shearer, the real life ballerina gave a heartbreaking and awe-inspiring performance as a ballet dancer Vicky Page for whom to dance meant to live and to live meant to dance. She never included love in the equation and one day she found herself trapped in the red shoes forever just like the girl from the ballet ""The Red Shoes"" that was written by a young composer with whom Vicky fell in love. The ballet was produced for the stage by a powerful talented world famous impresario Boris Lermontov (based on Sergey Diaghilev, the head of the celebrated Russian Seasons, as brilliant as he was tyrannical, played to perfection by Anton Walbrook). The short ballet is included in the movie and it is 15 minutes of unbearable perfection where colors, music and dance blend into unforgettable delight. When you watch dancing Shearer with her glowing red hair of rare shade that matches the color of the magic shoes you would want to capture the moment of beauty and keep it forever in the vaults of your memory.

And never more so than in this masterpiece directed by Michael Powell and Emmeric Pressburger in 1948. I'm not going to add much to what other users have said, except that the romantic triangle between a dancer, an impresario and a pianist really works, and is the heart of the movie. The color photography is wonderful, and allows us to see the world in 1948 as if it were today. Perhaps the scene that stands most of my mind is the first one, with all the young people struggling to enter into the theater. This recalls an era where young people love classical music, and would treat its performers as if they were rock stars. That era would end just a few years later, when rock and roll come to the fore, and the world would never be the same. Whether this change was for the good or for the bad, let others decide.

267926,4,6300217728,"""The Red Shoes"" is another of those great British movies that you'd probably ignore if you hadn't had to see it for some film-as-literature class, though it proves to be one of those happy surprises.  Aloof at first - giving every sign that it's just a movie by fans of ballet for other fans of ballet, and about those who live and breathe the stage of dance - ""Shoes"" morphs into a tortured story of artists consumed by their art.  Moira Shearer is the ravishing Vicki Page, a daughter of privilege who surrenders everything to join the company of the seemingly inhuman Lermontov.  Wellbrook plays the tyrannical Lermontov - the master who disdains of love and lovers, and just about anything else that threatens to sweep his ballerinas off their feet (and his stage).  Marcus Goring, who practically stole the show in Powell/Pressburg's ""Stairway to Heaven"", is Julian Craster, a young composer taken under Lermontov's leathery wings.  All three collide over Lermontov's attempt to stage a ballet based on Hans Christian Anderson's ""The Red Shoes"".  When the show (depicted here in an unbroken and hyper-stylized sequence lasting about 15 minutes) is a smash, Lermontov thinks he's made ballet history - he has, but he's unwittingly also made a couple of Craster and Page.  The other members of the company seem enchanted that the romance of the stage has stretched itself into the real world, but Lermontov (the last to learn of the affair) is appalled.  Love is a productive force, but art must consume.  The story of ""The Red Shoes"" underscores that point, and Lermontov's entire existence - the girl who wears the shoes is forced to dance, for the shoes know only the dance, and no end.  And the girl?  ""She dies"", Lermontov says, obviously finding nothing unsurprising in that.

Until it actually gets around to showing us ""Red Shoes"", the story isn't dramatic at - Craster is a hopeful composer, Lermontov the autocrat of his company, and Vicki Page a young ballerina who lives for the dance but doesn't envision replacing the company's prima ballerina.  Then after the ballet, ""Red Shoes"" shifts gears, and everything becomes more passionate, and we see just how the tug of war between art and love has nearly torn the leads in half.  I'm no fan of dance - certainly not ballet - but ""Shoes"" nevertheless found a foothold in me.  Moira Shearer is luminously beautiful, and at times seems to dance on smoke.  Walbrook is crushing as the overbearing and ultimately destroyed Lermontov; but it's the ""Red Shoes"" ballet that crowns the flick, illustrating the war between  art and love (and maybe mortality), it's like a French painting come to vibrant life.  In those awkward moments when they need a good chick flick, all men should keep these ""Red Shoes"" handy.",1159574400,13,2769,4.867803837953092

267948,5,6300217728,"Art films are rarely successful commercial interpretations relying more on art crowds with an art for arts sake attitude. Nevertheless, The Red Shoes is an ballet and art film that is a successful dramatic interpretation that excels in telling the story of a lovely young dancer, Victoria Page, who must decide between her desire to dance or to live as the wife to her love, a up and coming composer. Moria Scherer is the elegant dancer placed in the cross hairs of the powerful impresario, Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) her mentor and an obsessive control freak.  Lermontov wants his principal dancer to remain faithful only to his company and under his direction. As Vickie tries to make her way in the company, she is plucked from the chorus by Lermontov to dance the principal lead in the new ballet, ""The Red Shoes."" To familiarize her with its new music, Lermontov asks his assistant conductor, Julian Kraster (Marius Goring) to play for her during off-stage and on-stage moments. Throwing the two rising stars together, Lermontov sets in motion a situation for young love to blossom, a situation intolerable for the jealous, controlling ballet impresario.

The cinematic high point of the film is the 20 minute ballet of the Red Shoes, which for students and lovers of the ballet is one of the great treats of dance film history. Incorporating the stylized ballet techniques of the 40s, it is a window into the formal partnering and choreography techniques from European schools.  Influenced by the Russian style of the Imperial school, and more familiar to Europe's audiences, it is rarely seen in the U.S.  Incorporating the famous surrealistic look in sets and costumes, the story of the ballet foreshadows a dilemma which young Vickie will experience with disastrous results.

Other snips from the classical ballet repertoire features Copellia, Ballet Fantastique, and Les Sylphide, all rarely danced today. One principal dancer of note is the brilliant Russian choreographer and dancer, Leonide Massine, as Grecia Lubov, who recreates several of his characteristic leaps and tantrums from his own stellar career in Russia and Europe with the Ballet Russe.

This is a film made for color with shocking use of vibrant reds and blues that literally stun the eye. Shot on location in Monte Carlo and London, the film reflects plush settings of the great resort lifestyle with its opulence and grandeur. If films of art, music, and fantasy are your cup of tea, The Red Shoes is the film to watch.

The use of cinematography, editing, color, and art direction are a cineastes delight.  Moira Shearer, aside from being a highly expressive ballerina, has star wattage that rivals the reigning Hollywood sirens of the day.  Essential viewing for anyone who appreciates the possibilities of cinema.",1139702400,16,667,5.490196078431373
267950,5,6300217728,"Of all the Powell/Pressburger collaborations, THE RED SHOES is by far the most famous, and the most beloved. Although it has often been ridiculed for its melodramatic storyline, it's almost impossible to forget it once you've seen it, and it's been an incredibly potent allegory for the conflict of life and art for many people over the decades. As the commentary on this DVD repeatedly points out, its best to understand the film as a fairy tale, like the Hans Christian Andersen ballet at its core and from whence it derives its title. Moreover, Powell and Pressberger treated this almost as an experimental film, and worked almost every trick on it available to them to heighten its effects. It becomes thus almost a textbook case for a film scholar to see the different kinds of effects a film at the time could have in terms of playing with camera speed, double exposure, use of color, etc., and many of the individual shots are not only deservedly famous but seem to derive from minds as creative and playful as Griffith's: the great shot of Vicky's feet racing down the spiral staircase, the whirling pans from her point of view at the Mercury Theatre performance of ""Swan Lake,"" and so on. And then there are the fine performances from Moira Shearer, impossibly lovely as the heroine, and Anton Walbrook as her dashing but fearsome Svengali. It's a one-of-a-kind classic worthy of repetaed reviewings, and the Criterion folk give it all the supplemental material it deserves. The commentary is especially fine, with insightful comments from all manner of different people who either worked on the film (like Shearer, or the great cinematographer Jack Cardiff) or who have loved it over the years (like Martin Scorsese, who counts it as one of his most enormous influences). The restoration of the print is also spectacular, with the Disneyesque primary colors in its basic palette at their richest and most hypersaturated.",1136937600,20,1930,4.941538461538461

267952,4,6300217728,"`The Red Shoes', directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger in 1948 strikes me as a cult movie, similar to `The Rocky Horror Picture Show' whose memory and reputation outstrip many an Academy Award winner for best picture. It is hands down the very best movie ever made about ballet and it may very well be the best movie ever made about dance in general.

The context of the movie is loosely based on the ballet troupe, `Ballet Russe' which was founded in pre-Revolutionary Russia and survived until about 1927 based in Monaco. The `Ballet Russe' was a private ballet company famous for staging several of Igor Stravinsky's major works, famously choreographed by Njinsky. In fact, the role of the choreographer in `The Red Shoes', Leonide Massine, was a dancer and choreographer for the `Ballet Russe' after Njinsky. The object of the title is a fictional ballet based on the real Hans Christian Anderson story of the red shoes, which take on a life of their own. A ballerina puts on the shoes and dances with them, but can't stop when she gets tired, as the shoes don't want to stop dancing.

The choreographic centerpiece of the film is in the performance of this ballet written specifically for the film, performed primarily by ballerina Moira Shearer and Massine. The primary theme overlaid on the writing and performing of the ballet is the total commitment of the company's director, Boris Lermontov, loosely based on the Ballet Russe director Sergei Daigliav (sic). Lermontov promotes Shearer's character to starring roles in ballets after his prima ballerina leaves the company to be married. Shearer's character is torn between her devotion to ballet and her romance with the young composer of `The Red Shoes'.

Compared to the really great romantic movies such as `Casablanca', I suspect `The Red Shoes' is just a bit less compelling than it could have been. An artificial compulsion to dance can't quite hold a candle to the reality of the Gestapo in the Vichy France colony of Morocco. Some of the direction and special effects are just a bit overdone. The directors would have been better to just let the conventions of the ballet and conventional tricks of the live stage carry the day. The only `special effect' that really carries its weight is when a swirling page of newspaper is transformed into a live ballet partner for a scene in the ballet.

I am no judge of ballet, but I thought the dancing in this movie was exceptional, especially those parts done by Massine as the enchanting shoemaker and in other ballets. The original music was not exceptional. It was, to my ear, not modern enough to fit the historical exemplar of Stravinsky and the Ballet Russe.

Many technical elements of the filming are sensational. The movie did win an Academy Award for its color cinematography, which I am certain it deserved. Every time I watch this movie, I miss this rich color in the dully-colored films of today.

If you have never seen this movie, you really must see it at least once. If you like ballet and you have never seen this movie, then stop what you are doing and order a copy of the film. Now!

An important film for its dance. Less impressive in plot and music.",1133568000,11,3194,4.77536231884058
267953,5,6300217728,"A classic, even a masterpiece for some. Yet its story isn't much different from scores of MGM musicals of the 1930s and '40s: boy meets girl, a romance blossoms, they bicker, they make up. Interspersed would be musical numbers. So it is in this movie, only the musical numbers are ballet sequences, and at the end the girl dies.

Moira Shearer plays the ballerina, and Anton Walbrook and Marius Goring are the two men who fall in love with her. Walbrook is the head of the dance company, a man who believes a dancer's life is all dance, and Goring is a composer, a man with principles who wants to do things his own way. Shearer is caught in the middle: she loves Goring (in fact, marries him)but wants to dance, too, for Walbrook. As in the Hans Christian Anderson story on which it's based, she puts on her red ballerina shoes and dances to her death.

What makes the movie so appealing to many is its sincerity, along with a good, well-written script and excellent acting. The 20-minute ballet that Shearer performs as the climax of the picture is bold and captivating, and she seems literally to be on fire at both ends with her flaming red hair and the red shoes. (Merle Oberon was slotted to get the role.) Still considered the best dance movie ever filmed by many film-goers. Definitely worth a watch.",1131667200,6,1308,4.538135593220339
267954,5,6300217728,"What makes a good story? For most of us perhaps, it would center around tales that deal with things we are interested in, so that if we like slapstick humor, people like Laurel and Hardy are great. Or, if we like science fiction, it is hard to beat a good Star Trek story.

But I think a good story is one that can draw you outside your area of interest, and make you react to something that you would otherwise have no interest. Perhaps ""react""  is a good word to use, and not necessarily ""enjoy."" In spite of a dislike for a certain type of story, you just might find yourself reacting to a character from the story in spite of yourself. This is what we have with the movie, The Red Shoes. By itself, its very nature is enough to turn off a great many viewers. The background of the story is set in a ballet company that travels the world giving performances, and it is the story of one young woman who is given her chance to do what she always wanted--to dance. For her, to dance is to live, and to live is to dance. Giving her this chance is a man to whom ballet is a religion, and anyone who looks back is not fit for his kingdom. The bottom line is that for him, ballet is all that is or ever will be, and whoever would be in his ballet company must give up everything else. The man is accused of not having any heart. And he doesn't.

OK. So we have a crisis love story set against a dance background. So what? Every area of life, no matter how obscure, seems to rise to the top to claim its 15 minutes of fame. Classical music was just there until ""Switched On Bach"" came along, and suddenly classical music was in. People may not have always enjoyed the old hillbilly humor of the old ""Hee Haw"" TV show, but suddenly Jeff Foxworthy makes being a redneck kind of cool and fun. Golf has always had its fans, but when Tiger Woods came on the scene everyone in golf became a winner. And when The Red Shoes hit the theaters in 1948, it turned on a good many young girls to the art of ballet.

Ballet is admittedly an obscure art form. On one hand, some of the world's greatest athletes are dancers, and what they can do with their bodies would put many people in the hospital just for watching the contortions. Who in their right mind would want to go through months if not years of suffering just to be able to stand on your very tip toes, and walk that way? And it takes effort to watch ballet, because like opera, stories are told through the dance, and you have to work at paying attention to catch the story line. Ballet has been used to tell the story of Romero and Juliet, as well as Anne Frank. Just by dancing. And then there are the costumes. If other women were to wear these types of clothes to a shopping mall they would be arrested for indecency. You won't find any more form fitting costumes than on a male and female ballet dancer, as very little is left to the imagination. And then there are the girly-guys of ballet. Male ballet dancers don't exactly seem like the macho types.

For me, the ballet in movies makes a background for a suspenseful Alfred Hitchcock film, or perhaps something wrapped around ""The Phantom of the Opera."" Watching this movie, I find myself waiting for a murder mystery to begin, but nothing even comes close to this. Instead, what we get is an answer to the question of what happens when two opposite desires collide, and you have to make a choice as to which desire you want. On one hand, if you stay with this ballet company you will have met your life's ambition to dance, and dance, and dance, and dance for people all over the world. On the other hand, you are working for a man who has no room for romance between men and women in his ballet company, and if such a thing should happen it is seen as the ultimate act of betrayal, and the person is dismissed with a wave of his hand. Well, the romance does come along, and  Moira Shearer as the female lead becomes like a person with two ropes attached to her, both pulling in opposite directions. On one hand is this consuming attitude by her boss, who demands that people eat, drink, and sleep ballet. On the other hand is a blossoming love that she doesn't want to let get away.

It is a story that could have taken place in any kind of a background--perhaps with a demanding boss from an office setting, a boss who demands his employees work 14 hours a day to meet their productivity goals. Or perhaps in a sweat shop from a story that takes place in the 1880s. But it doesn't. The story takes place in a ballet company, and what we have here is ballet as you have never seen it before. It is like ""The Sound of Music"" meets ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" In one of the most stunning dance sequences ever caught on film, the dancers on stage are transported into a kind of non-stop dream sequence made up of an almost hallucinogenic color, and the dance just goes on, and on, and on. Solid flesh and blood dance partners are turned into two dimensional  paper dance partners. The dancers are on a stage one moment, but the next they are transported to some imaginary world, or in a moment morph into birds. And they keep on dancing at a level no human being could sustain. But they do here.

This is most likely not the kind of film that people who receive this e-mail will want to stand in line to watch. It is about boring high society people who can define the word, ""snob."" It is a film about a high form of culture that most of us would be bored to tears attending--we'd much rather be at a U2 concert than sit and watch a two hour ballet performance. Unless you like looking at the female ballet dancers wearing what appears to be sprayed on butt huggers. No, this film is more modest.

But underneath all of this is a basic human interest story. No matter what your background is, no matter what your job is, you feel stress, you feel pain, you experience longing, and for some of us these feelings are buried beneath a crusty exterior, and for others who are aware of their feelings we have some hard choices to make.

Perhaps the most difficult thing about this movie is that you have to sit through the entire movie before everything comes together. And even then you will have to think about what you just got done seeing. And even then it will not necessarily cause you to fall in love with this movie, but it will cause you to react to it. But the way the movie ends is a big bang.

The Red Shoes of the title refers to the color of the ballet slippers. The movie is based upon a story by Michael Powell and Emerich Pressburger, who in turn based their story on a Hans Christian Anderson story, but they gave the story a darker twist: "" under the theatrics and glory is an all-consuming lifestyle with the power to destroy those who love it perhaps too much.""--Sean Axmaker (Amazon).

Watching this movie may give you the same feeling you get when you read the doom and gloom from the Old Testament book of Jeremiah. Surely, there are more exciting things to read, but perhaps in spite of this, when you think about the message, being uncomfortable is not always so bad.

If reading the book of Jeremiah can make you appreciate the ease of Psalm 23 better, films like The Red Shoes can help you appreciate a simple story line. If nothing else, if you refuse to see this movie, you should watch the main dance squence. Where is a good HAL 9000 computer when you need one?",1112054400,10,7385,4.288378766140602

Not only it contains one of the most memorable ballet sequences in any age, but also is a mature film in what its purposes concern. Would you sacrifice the love of your life or would follow your bliss through the art?  The ever lasting question has been formulated internally for so many artists. The special case of Frau Teresa Carreo, the renowned Venezuelan pianist faced the similar challenge. And it would be the right time for reminding you this is precisely the central conflict in Ingmar Bergman's Autumn Sonata for instance.

This lovely artist will face the painful choice. And please ignore all the relative comments around the movie about the overdramatic tone. A decision of this level will involve your whole life, so you make your choice. The art for not dying of the truth or the obvious loneliness leaving behind you all the affective universe of your beloved couple.

The richness of color in this film is in my mind unparalelled in any other I've ever seen. Everything shimmers, from the blue of the Mediterranean in the Monte Carlo scenes, to the deep red of Moira Shearer's hair. Even on my CED disk.

If the production values weren't so incredible, and the ballet so beautifully done, this would frankly be just another weepy romance. But everything in the film is interpolated to perfection to advance the story and illustrate the deeper psychological workings of the characters' minds.

Two points which occurred to me from other reviewers: 1) Favorite quote ""Even the best magician can't pull a rabbit from a hat if there isn't already a rabbit in the hat"" 2) Vicky Page destroys her life when she cannot make the decision between dancing and her life. Moira Shearer left dancing at 27 and lost plum movie assignments later (""Hans Christian Andersen"" for instance when she became pregnant) because she would not be separated from her family.

268012,5,6300217728,"Directors Powelland Pressburger collaborated in a number of films but The Red Shoes tops them all. This 1948 TechniColor movie has become a classic and lovers of the ballet fondly look to this film for inspiration. Stars ballerina turned actress Moira Shearer as Victoria Page the tragic heroine who wears the fatal shoes, Antal Walbrook as the demanding and imperious manager/impresario Boris Lentmontov. The film is drawn from the Hans Christian Anderson tale, in which a young girl is given red shoes by a shop keep only to dance herself to death. The film never even borders on magic realism nor is over the top but maintains a subtle psychological drama that turns grotesque into a climatic and grim finale.
 Moira Shearer's performance is Oscar worthy. Vicky Page learns from Lentmontov all the right stuff to be a dedicated dance artist. But the ballet is second in her heart when she falls in love with a young composer/conductor. Distracted by love, Lentmontov worries that he has lost his greatest star. The crisis is even greater because apparently, cold though he is, Lentmontov falls for Vicky himself. Anton Walbrook delivers a great performance as Lentmontov. He would later take on the role of King Ludwig of Bavaria in the French Max Ophuls film ""Lola Montes"". There is an extended ballet sequence, the original ballet ""The Red Shoes"" which makes use of magic animation and colorful backdrops. This film is genius and art. A great film to be shown in ballet history class or dance classes. This is also a caution film. Perhaps it's unwise to seek artistic perfection. It's ultimately Victoria Page's own fault for her tragedy. The Red Shoes is a metaphor. She became a slave to her art and it destroyed her. Her indecision cost her greatly. Which is greater ? Perfection in her ballet career or true love ? Torn by her love of ballet and her love for Julian, she meets a dire fate. This movie is incredible. All the scenes, dialogue are artistic composition.

268015,5,6300217728,"The Red Shoes was one of the best ventures by The Archers, the joint production company by Briton Michael Powell and Hungarian emigre to Britain Emeric Pressburger, considered to be the definitive film marrying ballet and cinema.
The story of the Red Shoes by Hans Christian Andersen forms the basis for the story of aspiring dancer Victoria Page, aspiring composer Julian Crasster, and ballet company impresario Boris Lermontov, who takes on the latter two under his wing.  Crasster's involvement begins when portions of his work Hearts Of Fire is appropriated in a ballet, and he's given the job of orchestra coach, when he confronts Lermontov.  Page comes to the attention of the maestro when the latter snubs an offer by the girl's aristocratic aunt to see her dance.  To the Russian, ballet is more than poetry and motion, but his religion, and hence, not an audition.  He tries her out at a separate audition, where she makes the final cut.
Lermonotov decides to stage his next ballet based on Andersen's tale, with Victoria as the principle (Victoria Principle?  just kidding) and Crassner as the composer.  The ballet is a hit, for Lermontov and the whole film, as it's the highlight of the entire movie, with Victoria's flaming red hair a marked contrast to her pale skin and outfit, the ruby red shoes forming a near-symmetry, as they are on her toes.  The choreography as well as the music is masterful.  Despite Lermonotov and Crassner's insistence that ""the music is all that matters,"" for us the film viewer, it's also the colours and dancing that do as well.  Indeed, though the cinematography missed an Oscar, the score and art-direction/set decoration did not.
However, as demonstrated by the departure of his previous star, Irina Boronskaya due to marriage, the authoritarian Lermontov takes this personally, almost a heresy to his religion of ballet.  To him, a dancer relies on the doubtful comfort of human love.  Once that doubt is removed, goodbye dancing shoes, tights, exercise bar, hello high heels, stockings, and kitchen.  He is determined to make Page a master dancer, and anything that comes in the way, he sees as a detriment to himself.
As for the original story, it's of a girl who puts on a pair of enchanted red shoes that keep on dancing even when the girl doesn't want to.  This movie is a reinterpretation of it, where the ballet soon turns to real life.
This was Moira Shearer's debut film, and first of only six movies, and the young Scot creates a vivid but fragile and fairylike Victoria, aspiring dancer, the subject of her Svengali-like mentor, and emotionally tortured between being a dancer and a housewife.  As she did ballet from age six, an ideal choice.  And Ludmilla Tcherina, who plays Irina and who just recently died, was a former prima ballerina of the Monte Carlo ballet, so another great choice.  And admire or hate his petty authoritarian personality, Anton Walbrook's powerful personality drives the movie.  But Leonide Massine as the flamboyant, camp dancing coach Grigori Lyubov steals the show.  Shearer, Massine, and the two directors would be reunited in The Tales Of Hoffman.
A visual triumph in the dancing scenes, as is the foreign location footage.  Oh, and the Archers team wasn't the only one inspired by Andersen's tale, as Kate Bush created a reinterpretation of it in her The Line, Curve, and Cross short film.",1080172800,55,3383,4.913884007029877

Frankly, at that age, I really didn't fully understand (much less appreciate) what I had just seen but I knew it was something quite special. And so it remains decades later. To some extent based on one of Hans Christian Andersen's tales, this film examines the brief and tragic career of a young ballerina, Victoria Page (Moira Shearer), who becomes an international celebrity following her performance of The Red Shoes while a member of the Lermontov Ballet Company. Shearer's performance is most credible when she dances, of course, but at least adequate when delivering her lines. The strongest performances are those of Marius Goring (Craster) and Anton Walbrook (Lermontov) who portray men in love with the same woman. The plot is really insignificant to the music and especially to the dancing. I also enjoy the exterior shots in London and Paris in the late-1940s. For me, the 15-minute ballet sequence is among the most enjoyable audiovisual experiences on film and was perhaps an inspiration for the extended dream sequence in An American in Paris three years later.

Also when Anton Walbrook announces that ""the performance will not go on"" (because Vicky's carked it), (...) the hair, the moustache, the shreiking voice -- was that intentional?",1041120000,14,833,4.942857142857143
268077,5,6300217728,"One of the most imaginitive and elaborate backstage musicals ever filmed, and many have called it great. The movie contains a 14 - minute ballet, also called THE RED SHOES based upon a Hans Christian Andersen story about a wicked shoemaker who sells and enchanted pair of slippers to a young girl. Delighted at first with the slippers in which she dances joyously, she discovers that the slippers will not let her stop dancing - and the bewitched, exhausted girl dies. The film's story is, of course, the same story, spelled out in more complicated terms, with the shoemaker of the ballet (Leonide Massine) replaced by the megalomaniac ballet impresario played by Anton Walbrook. The exquisite Moira Shearer is the ballerina; the cast includes Marius Goring as the young composer. Self-conscious though the film may be, it nonetheless affects some people passionately and it's a classic of a kind. Written, produced and directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger - who were master purveyors of high kitsch - this colour film is sure to please discerning lovers of whimsy and ballet.",1026432000,11,1089,5.0220994475138125
268078,5,6300217728,"THE RED SHOES is a classic of film-making.  With a highly dramatic plot and an unforgettable score, it truly is a masterpiece.
Into the famous Lermontov Company comes young Victoria Page (Moira Shearer).  A ballerina eager to master her craft.  Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) is already aware of Vicky's talents, and soon Vicky is one of the principal artists in the company.
However, Vicky finds herself attracted to the young composer Julian Craster (Marius Goring), whom Lermontov has patronised.  Soon Vicky finds herself caught between two loves - the simple human passion that has caught up Julian and herself, and the jealous ballet master Lermontov.
All of this comes to a head in the ballet ""The Red Shoes"".  The story concerns a young girl who buys a pair of enchanted red shoes.  The shoes cause her to dance and dance for eternity until she is driven to her death.
In life, and in the ballet, Vicky dances to her ultimate destruction...
With a beautiful ballet score by Brian Easdale, and stunning choreography by Sir Robert Helpmann, this is the ""Holy Grail"" of ballet films.
With Leonide Massine, Robert Helpmann, Albert Basserman, Ludmilla Tcherina and Esmond Knight.",996883200,13,1184,5.01530612244898
268079,5,6300217728,"I waited 50 years! to re-see this movie. Anton Walbrook is first rate; his best film. The color is magnificent, even in the reproduced DVD. It could well be titled: Ballet for people who hate ballet. There's never too much. The moody music, the dance, the actors/actresses are all splendid. Yes, you can go back again. I highly recommend it as a ""must have"" in the nucleus of your film library.

7806879,5,6300217728,"In my top 10 favorite movies of all time. People who like Black Swan need to watch this. Superb effects (it's 1948 people) that remind you of George Mlis' earlier works, and unbelievably beautiful dancing from Moira Shearer-an actual dancer from the Royal Ballet. Yup...An actual brilliant ballerina and actress?? Imagine Hollywood using people who are actual triple threats now instead of looking for huge names (Russell Crowe in Les Mis anyone?). Natalie Portman, while an amazing actress, was a complete laugh as a passible principal dancer with one of America's top ballet companies-give me a freaking break. Oh wait back to the movie-Gorgeous, sweeping shots of France and Monaco and England all in Technicolor being swept along by one of the best scores in film history. Here's what the Economist said about it, because they say it better and don't go off on personal, super opinionated rants:

The Red Shoes, originally a short story by Hans Christian Andersen, is now better known to the world as a British film classic made by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. In their hands, a sinister tale about a pair of shoes that compelled the wearer to dance indefinitely became a complex romantic tragedy about the power struggles in an international ballet company, and an allegory of ambition and sexual desire. The fictional company is run by a saturnine figure whose new ballerina is played by the entrancing, flame-haired Moira Shearer (who was, in real life, a member of the fledgling Royal Ballet). Released in 1948, the film has been hailed as the greatest picture from one of the greatest film-making teams. Its one that plumbs the dark recesses of all our imaginations: thrilling and terrifying by turns.",1513555200,7,1720,5.035087719298246
