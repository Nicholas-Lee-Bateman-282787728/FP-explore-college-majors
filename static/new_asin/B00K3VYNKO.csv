8655729,5,B00K3VYNKO,"There are two DVDs, two programs. Solitary Nation is about the solitary prisoners but the one that really shows how broken the system is, Prison State which takes an intimate look at the cycle of mass incarceration in America and a statewide effort to reverse the trend, following four residents of a housing project in Louisville, Ky., as they cycle in and out of the state's jails and prisons.

This is a system that is set up to fail. How can you sent someone, anyone especially a prisoner who is not wanted by the society regardless of race or color, with only a khaki pants and a sweat shirt, and not a dime in his pockets when you release him from prison. Where can they go, where can he live except being homeless without a dime in his pocket. What is a criminal without a dime in his pocket going to do except the only way he knows how to get money commit another crime.

They should show the Prison State DVD everywhere they can including schools since if Americans think that they can have a healthy society with what you will witness in this documentary, they better think once again.",1433980800,,1095,4.442786069651741

8655731,3,B00K3VYNKO,"There are two Frontline episodes on this one DVD.  One explores segregation inside Maine prisons; the other speaks of prisoners in Kentucky generally.  The Kentucky-based program is about 40 minutes longer than the one for Maine.  The program in Maine has almost entirely white interviewees.  That is not surprising as Maines racial diversity is incredibly small.  The program in Kentucky had 4 interviewees, all Black.  Kentucky is only 7% Black, yet its own corrections website says its prison population is 50% Black.  The Maine interviewees have accents very similar to those who live in Rhode Island or Boston; I was quite surprised to witness that.
The two programs are jaw-dropping for different reasons.  In the Maine segment, they show much excrement and splattered blood.  In fairness, the narrator begins by saying disturbing images will be seen in the program.  The Kentucky program tugged at me because of the two, young females in it.  One girl stated, Im useless.  If I go to Hell, then thats where Im meant to be.  The program stated that a girl named Demetria had a mother who committed suicide when she was 9 years old and shes diagnosed with anxiety disorder.  Still, every time the camera shows her, she is twitching and shaking all over the place.  I wonder if the poor thing has Parkinsons or Tourettes.  No matter what the cause, it was incredibly disturbing for me to watch, yet the narrator says nothing of it.
The program in Kentucky featured two Black males and two young, Black females.  I appreciate the gender diversity.  However, most inmates, no matter the age are male; the gender makeup in prison is faaaaar from 50-50.  Further, some viewers could leave with the idea that all Black adult prisoners are male and all Black youth prisoners are female: so not the case.
One corrections expert stated, We need to separate who were mad at compared to who were afraid of.  He means that while the society may need to keep violent criminals away from others, when we lock up child support dodgers, drug addicts, petty thieves, etc. is costing states too much and also harming those criminals too violently.  Both programs show the futility of both states practices.  In Maine, segregation is driving inmates insane.  In Kentucky, locking up so many people for huge periods of time is just costing too much.  The program suggests both states are working on the problem, but the results are coming slowly or studies on their changes have yet to be concluded.
For those interested in corrections matters, this should be quite interesting.  I can imagine a lot of criminal justice majors in their first semesters in college also benefitting from watching this.",1401667200,,2684,4.898004434589801
