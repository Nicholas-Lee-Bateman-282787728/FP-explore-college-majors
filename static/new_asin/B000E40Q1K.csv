8105575,5,B000E40Q1K,"We were lucky enough to find this DVD at our local library and decided to try it.  My son is 2 1/2 and his younger brother is 1 and they absolutely love this video.  There are a few items on this video that are beyond their years, but they'll grow into it soon enough.  What is so wonderful about this video is its content - all of it.  It begins with a great song about imagining snow and rain being gumdrops and cupcakes.  It's animated with real children as well, and the music is done very well.  The video then moves to a story encouraging your child to participate by naming the symbols in the story.  There are more songs, that also contain lyrics, and stories all with a different slant but all about using the imagination.  My little ones love this video so much, and they love the Noodlebug theme song!  Trust me, you must have this for your video collection.  You can buy these dvd's through their website.",1152403200,9,917,4.341176470588235
