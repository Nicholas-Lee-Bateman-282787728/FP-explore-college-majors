7390933,5,B014EU6JU6,This movie is exactly what you'd expect for a made for TV movie. It was funny and campy and I enjoyed it! The kid's jokes were hilarious!,1450051200,,137,4.111111111111111
7390934,1,B014EU6JU6,poorly written waste of time and distasteful film it went in the garbage can,1449878400,,76,4.5
7390935,1,B014EU6JU6,"This movie sounded like it had a great premise. The husband is a bodyguard for a famous singer. The tabloids claim he had an affair with the singer based on some doctored photos. This leads the wife to divorce him. Two years later, they end up at their cabin together alone over a misunderstanding. A blizzard traps them there with the guy's female friend who had shown up as a surprise. There is a subplot with the ex-wife's new fiancee who needs a green card. The problem with this movie is that the acting is horrific, the storyline is choppy and there is almost no character development. I usually like Dean Cain in roles like this on TV movies, but he is hardly part of this movie. His character gets little screen time and doesn't do much. He comes across as a nice guy but isn't involved to a very large degree. There seems to be the potential for chemistry between the characters but they don't interact a whole lot. The mother-in-law and daughter are extremely annoying and unlikable characters that don't add any charm to the movie. There is one extended scene in which the daughter tries to annoy the mom's fiancee by chewing with her mouth open. The last straw is that this is supposed to be a Christmas movie but barely has much to do with Christmas. It happens to take place at Christmas and there are a few token Christmas decorations and some Christmas songs on the soundtrack, but mostly the annoying subplot between the new fiancee and the ex-wife takes center stage. If you like TV Christmas movies, do yourself a favor and avoid this one at all costs. There are so many good ones out there that there is no sense in wasting time on this mess.",1449878400,6,1662,4.488448844884489
7390936,4,B014EU6JU6,"I liked this---didn't LOVE it---sorry! The story just didn't make much sense to ME.
The man loved the woman [his wife] who believed a photograph that HE said was
photo-shopped, and fake: showing HIM with ANOTHER woman. SHE left him, and
TWO YEARS LATER, they get back togethert again. I wish I had SOME of those
90-minutes back.",1448928000,5,328,4.672413793103448

7390938,1,B014EU6JU6,"I thought this would be good because it had Dean Cain in it. However, we only watched a little of it and my husband and I said we were both so lost. We couldn't tell who was who; who was supposed to be the bad guy or good guy. It was just confusing. Another one we passed along to our daughter because she not only love Christmas movies, she loves Dean Cain. Again, I told her that if she didn't like it to give it back and I'd donate it. It's almost hard to donate such back movies to unsuspecting people.",1448496000,6,506,4.01980198019802
7390939,2,B014EU6JU6,"I love Kristy Swanson & Dean Cain in most all the movies I've seen them in , especially any Hallmark movies. That's what attracted me to this movie. I'm very disappointed. The movie was mostly boring . I did not appreciate the stupid humor in it with the attorney's husband and son. This is supposed to be a Christmas movie. The very loose plot around the characters was unrealistic and rediculous. I'm assuming it was supposed to be somewhat funny and serious in the end. In my view this movie is a waste of money and really does not support the feeling of Christmas very much at all.  It's not a Hallmark movie and it showed.",1447977600,15,627,4.405172413793103

8730486,1,B014EU6JU6,"Merry Ex-Mas is a made originally for TV in 2014 movie full of unlikable characters.  The only likable character was Dean Cain's, Jessie, but even he's a doormat without much of a backbone.  Basically his character is a bodyguard for some pop star, who tabloids as they do release a cropped photograph of his employer in his arms, stating they're having an affair.  Since this doesn't do her career any harm, the pop star doesn't publicly deny it.  But his wife Noelle (one of the few Christmas references in the movie, this isn't really a Christmas film you can watch it any time), throws all his possessions on the front lawn, and when he starts picking them up starts hitting golf balls at him.  Her vile mother also joins in and he is forced to leave when she gets a shotgun.  Now if you're wife wants a divorce over something you didn't do, commits domestic violence and flies off the handle like that, would you really want to stay married to her?  That's the weakness of the plot, because she's got nothing to offer other than being hot (Kristy Swanson, Buffy back in the 1992 movie).  Noelle runs a wedding planning business, hasn't paid her staff in a while.  She's now dating (two years later) Flynn, an Irish businessman (Lochlyn Munro), who unbeknownst to her is about to get kicked out of the US when his visa expires. He's desperate to tie the knot so he doesn't loose a three million dollar business deal. Not real sure why it would matter which country he is a citizen of, but for this plot it does.  Throw in an annoying spoilt brat teen daughter who enjoys sabotaging an important business call for Flynn, even though he offered to give her lift to her dad's cabin in his private jet, just so she could go to a sleepover party the night before.  She's just obnoxious the whole movie, chews with her mouth open.  Then you've also got an odd lawyer character who also treats Flynn with contempt, by while being on the clock on the phone to him gets into conversations with her son who likes to drop his guts all the time. There's a poorly spliced together conversation (the frames are all over the place, the kid is standing in one stance, then another, then another) between the lawyer and her son where the kid actor has obviously ad libbed a number of insults, and they've just put them all in, one after the other.

The movie is very predictable, you know exactly how it's going to play out early on, and there really isn't a fun journey in getting there.",1513123200,,2475,4.485523385300668
