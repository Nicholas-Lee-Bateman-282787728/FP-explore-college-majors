8216280,5,B000V259OE,"Dark, violent and grim,  the period setting of this Viking era is beautiful yet awful at the same time. The boy who plays young Harald is vaulted on a journey that takes him from a position of innocence and privilege to the depths of depravity and disillusionment.  Really well done.",1413158400,,283,4.64
8216281,5,B000V259OE,"This is one of those films that passed me by until I spotted a review on line. It was made in 1997 and tells the story of Harald who is the son of the chief Viking of his village, his dad Agne, he also has a brother with learning difficulties, a mother and some slaves or `thralls' as they were called. There is a new king who is slightly bonkers and has let power go to his head. As part of that he decides he will confiscate all the ships from all the fjords. One of his `envoys' arrives at Haralds village and is given less than a warm reception after demanding their ship.

Agne decides to flee north with all the men to join the rebels to fight the tyranny of King Grimnir. Yet oops, in that no sooner have they done a tactical retreat then Grimnir's men turn up with a spot of revenge on their mind and wanting a ship to appease the King, but instead they find the women, children and old men.

What follows is a tale of fighting back, and how we all choose how to resist, we have some retribution, both physical and sexual, but it is all done with a lot of taste, this is not a gore fest and does not trade on the violence, but the inter play of the relationships, and seeing it all through the disappearing innocence of the young Harald and his thrall Elisa.

This is now hard to get hold of, but you can still track it down on demand in a few places and believe me it is worth the effort. There is no CGI, the acting is all to the high end of excellent and you even get to see a few shipbuilding techniques. This is not a blockbuster either, but the attention to detail and the real filth and grime are done brilliantly, some of the Viking costumes are well scary too, you can see why people just ran away from them. At 84 minutes long this is one of those films that never was gonna out stay its' welcome and leaves you feeling better for having seen it. Young Harald played by Holger Thaarup is superb and this is the only film the little tyke ever made, which is our loss, directed superbly by Jesper W. Nielsen who also did the original `Borgen' TV series and `I et speil i en gte' or `Through A Glass Darkly' as we came to know the remake. I can not recommend highly enough.",1341100800,3,2188,4.107476635514018
