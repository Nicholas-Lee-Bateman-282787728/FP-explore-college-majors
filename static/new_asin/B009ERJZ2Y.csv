8540666,1,B009ERJZ2Y,"When I watch a film as bad as this one was and it's time to write a review, I always try to remember everyone involved in the making of the film are people with feelings who COULD stumble upon the words I write here.  And so it is with these people in mind, I struggle to find something kind or positive to say about The Rule of Law...
The best I can do is say something constructive: there is a delay in the audio to video and it makes (continued) watching difficult.

The movie as a whole is poorly executed.
From scene to scene there is no fluidity--it jumps from a bombing to a guy being arrested to some jailbird being interviewed with no set up so the viewer has no context to help understand what is happening with each scene leap or how the scenes may relate to one another. I still have no clue why there was a 3 second scene of a chick in lingerie putting on clothes since she had nothing to do with the scene before or the scene after.
The dialogue throughout was choppy and wooden (at best).
Whomever wrote the script CLEARLY has a negative view of all people in all law enforcement agencies.  It is also clear the writer (and director??) went with their biased, uninformed opinions of what all cops are like rather than do actual research (I mean, you could have at LEAST interviewed several cops from different agencies if you couldn't be bothered to take tours and do ride-a-longs...).  The dialogue and attitudes of every cop made the story unrealistic and less interesting.  I, myself, did some lip-curling at the repeated stupidity of it all.  And don't get me wrong--I know it's a movie but SOME realism might have been nice.  I mean, my granny would easily recognize all that was wrong with this film merely from having watched her weekly programs.

The majority of the actors over-acted their parts and had jerky, abnormal expressions and mannerisms.  I couldn't figure out if the actors were inexperienced, just poor actors, or if the script made them all appear worse than they really are.

I liked the IDEA the creators had but the lack of effort and caring the makers put into their work is glaring and I am sadly disappointed.  I really want to ask the makers why they even bothered going to all the trouble and cost if they weren't going to do their best.  At least I HOPE this isn't their best...",1485820800,,2324,4.455188679245283
8540667,5,B009ERJZ2Y,The story moved quickly and the characters were interestingly created and presented in a unique way that kept you guessing and involved. Cali the Matial Arts expert was easy to like and tough as nails. It was an amazing film. JB,1363046400,2,228,4.585365853658536
