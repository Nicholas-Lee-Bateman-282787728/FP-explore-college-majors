8109535,2,B000EGDCCS,"The production of Francis Drake consists of a narration, some live action monologues, beautiful costumes, and nice close-ups of antique maps. The acting by the Francis Drake character, and other characters, consists mainly in a number of poses. There is little real dialogue, just mainly monologues by the actors. Francis Drake's speech is somewhat easy to understand, but there is a young, blond-haired actor who plays some other character, whose speech is unintelligible. At one point, the Queen Elizabeth character talks to herself by a window, posing stiffly. Wouldn't if have been better to have her talking with some other character? This picture could be helped a bit if it allowed you to activate captions, since the actor's speech is not well recorded. The scenes of the ship, both inside and out, are lovely and inspiring. However, there are no scenes of the ship (Golden Hinde) in the proximity of any other ships, and there are no scenes of it docking near any beaches or towns. Hence, the production as a whole gets a little monotonous. The production could be improved by a few dialogues involving two actors, an argument or two, a short debate, some amusing banter. The company that made this video made a large series of videos on historic persons. Unfortunately, I also bought their version of King Alfred the Great. It too, has monotonous monologues, and speech that is not well recorded.",1503273600,,1406,4.961864406779661
8109536,2,B000EGDCCS,"This speaks about the 1500s tensions between England and Spain.  If you liked the film ""Elizabeth,"" then you make like this.  The work speaks of tensions on ocean voyages and so it reminded me of ""Master and Commander"" as well.

Here's my struggle:  the narrator relays fact after fact, so this work can be seen as informative.  However, there was something about it that was dull to me.  This was a big yawner and I can't quite place my thumb on as to why.

To find old ships and record them actually sailing on water must have been an expense.  Otherwise, the reenactments by actual people were cheesy and dull.  The work speaks of Drake meeting indigenous people in the Americans and a Sultan and yet there are no people of color seen here, a wasted opportunity for actors of color who could use this on their CVs.  The work does provide views of ancient paintings and maps in addition to the reenactments.  It doesn't interview living historians.",1201132800,5,950,4.595238095238095
