I am, by nature, a misanthropic kill joy with unnecessary high standards and no sense of fun.

REVIEW

I love many of the Disney songs and my daughter loves music.  I thought that this would be a good introduction to Disney since I think she is a little young for the movies.  I was very wrong.

My complaints, in no particular order:

1. The DVD is an obviously just a reprint of a VHS created item.  The picture quality is terrible.  I have recordings from television that look better than this.  I don't expect Blu-Ray, but a good clean image is what I have come to expect from a purchased DVD.

2. The songs are embedded within a framing device of a duck professor teaching us about singing and laughing.  That would be fine, but it makes skipping to the good songs tedious.  The best strategy is using the chapter skip button on the remote.  Individual songs can be reached through the main menu, but when the song is over, the DVD does not return you to the menu.  It continues on to the next interstitial and song.

3. The menu music is some sort of generic, electronically produced loop of tonal assault that has been mixed so that it is louder than the rest of the video.  This alleged music plays over the end credits as well.  This cacophony is an abomination, and its master recording should be nuked from space.

4. The sing along words are not present throughout the entirety of each song.  Granted, my kid can't read, but I can.  I was looking forward to singing along with my child.  Unfortunately, I have no idea what the words are in parts of these songs because the lyrics disappear for long stretches.  I don't remember the second verse to ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious."" *That's why I wanted a version with sing along lyrics.*  The on-screen lyrics are the whole point of this video.

Combine the difficult navigation with the absent lyrics, then throw in the lousy picture quality.  I would be better off enabling the closed captioning and fast forwarding around the actual films.",1437264000,9,2280,4.646616541353383

2423929,4,B000BMGEIO,"As a child I loved watching the Sing-Along videos. I was thrilled that I was able to find a few of them on DVD, they don't have all of the ones that were originally on VHS but hopefully in the future they will come out with those as well. This DVD is clear and is a lot of fun to watch.

The only issue that I have is that this is only a 30min DVD and prior to the title screen they have previews for other Disney movies. The Disney Baby Einstein DVD's never had previews and that is wonderful. I don't think it is necessary to have to have previews for a movie that is so short. This is not a complaint against the actual content of this DVD but just an overall observation.

Still love these and if you love Disney and listening to the music I would highly recommend them!!",1410480000,4,775,4.0588235294117645

2423959,3,B000BMGEIO,"I bought this singalong because I had previously purchased another Disney singalong which my son loved. Though this captures more memorable Disney songs, it seemed to not capture my sons attention as did some of the other singalongs.",1336003200,,233,5.157894736842105
2423960,4,B000BMGEIO,"I bought this for the 3 grandchildren who enjoyed the Mary Poppins movie.  They did like this version also, but were looking for certain parts from the movie that were not included in the sing along song cd. all in all is was entertaining for a short time for them!",1327276800,,265,4.3
2423961,5,B000BMGEIO,This is yet ANOTHER TERRIFIC purchase for my twin 3yr old princess lovers!!! They have SOOOO enjoyed this video til its almost WORN OUT! Sure wish was available via DVD? GREAT GREAT ITEM!,1322438400,,187,4.696969696969697
2423962,1,B000BMGEIO,"this video does not compare to the sing-along with the junglebook characters on the cover.  typically, my 19month old likes to dance but this vidoes gave him nothing to dance to.",1286928000,,178,4.741935483870968
2423963,5,B000BMGEIO,"I purchased this particular dvd because my girls loved all the 'Sing-Along Songs' vidoes when they were growing up. Although my toddler grandson is not an avid tv watcher, he will ask me to put in the ""music"". The dvd lasts about 25 minutes and has songs from many of the classic Disney movies. The words are on the screen so readers can sing along. When my older nephews are over, the three boys will march around the room and have a great time.",1286409600,,446,4.321428571428571
2423964,5,B000BMGEIO,"We bought this for our twin girls, who were 2 1/2 at the time, for Christmas last year.  They love it, and in fact Mary Poppins is one of their favorite movies.  This has their favorite Poppins songs (especially ""I Love to Laugh"") as well as some other classic songs that they have also come to enjoy.  The girls know the songs so well that they can sing many of them without the movie!  We all love this one!",1282262400,,409,4.139240506329114
2423965,1,B000BMGEIO,"Somehow my 5 month old saw Mary Poppins when she was 3 months old and fell in love with their music and dancing... go figure.
Ever since then, Mary Poppins DVD's bonus feature for sing along part (it has all the famous songs of the movie altogether) has been the favorite thing to be played in the house especially when she is not happy. Let me tell you, it even beats the teething!!! She becomes very calm and happy with the songs and even falls asleep even after uncontrollable pain of teething or fatigue and etc. So I wanted to buy the one that seems to have just songs for the car since I have to go through so may steps to set up the bonus feature on the movie. Plus, it's always good to have a back up for something that your child is extremely happy with.
Well, when I got this DVD, I was very disappointed because there were only 3 songs from Marry Poppins and not even ""A Spoonful of Sugar"" song which is her favorite.
I would have kept it if its quality was good enough to watch, but the picture quality was absolutely horrible.
We have Mary Poppins' 40 th anniversary DVD and it's beautifully enhanced.
I wouldn't pay $12 for this poor quality DVD, not even $5.
If you want to sing along Mary Poppins, just buy one of those special edition movie.
I don't recommend this DVD at all until Disney decides to update all of their sing along DVDs to fit this HD generation!!!",1276473600,2,1381,4.2748091603053435
2423966,3,B000BMGEIO,"My 2 year old loves the line of sing-along songs, but this is not one of her favorites.  She has watched it once, many of the others she will watch over and over and over again.",1266883200,,177,3.9166666666666665
2423967,3,B000BMGEIO,My 2 and 3 year old granddaughters were not that interested in this video.  Maybe older children would like it much better.,1252972800,,123,4.590909090909091

8088921,3,B000BMGEIO,"I feel bad giving this 3 stars....but it's needed. I loved these Sing-a-longs as a kid, and I as excited to give this to my God Daughter as she us now 4 and can appreciate it. It looks like it was sloppily transferred from the VHS original. I understand that the quality was not as good back then...but you could at least not let it look like a bad VHS recording! I cant complain about the sing selection, as it is listed in the product description, but the quality is severely lacking. If you are feeling nostalgic, this will defiantly cure your itch, but if you want to introduce new kids to this, I suggest you opt for the Disneyland one. At least that ones is like a 90's vibe nostalgia.",1506988800,2,691,4.282442748091603
