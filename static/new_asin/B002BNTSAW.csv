8361652,2,B002BNTSAW,It was not what I thought it would be. I thought there would be a workout routine and it wasn't. It has only the positions to practice in and I already knew that.,1406851200,,162,3.9393939393939394

The other reviewers criticized the DVD menu system and overall theme/production. The menus weren't a problem for me, you just have to hit the Skip or fast-forward on your DVD remote, then play 3 times to get past all the commercial intro stuff). It is a bit unusual, but once you get the hang of it, it's not a big deal.

This is not glamours video, rather a traditional practice with Indian students (one male, one female) in a small, simple studio. The setting consists of bright blue floors, bright yellow mat, and bright orange wall displays showing various stick-figure graphic yoga postures. The 2 students wear simple orange short sleeve shirts with dark blue pants. I love the practice it's self and it reminds me of ""Yin Yoga"" in that it is some-what passive by hold the pose, reflecting within, and connecting your mind with your body. It's a short enough practice that it doesn't take a big chuck of your time and is easily completed in the morning or evening.

Once you get to the main menu, you have two choices:

1. How to perform the Asanas.
This section has a menu selection for each of the postures in the ""Real Time Yoga Session, plus a section about meditation. This section helps to explain the postures if you have never done yoga before or need a refresher. This section will help you to actually understand the individual postures. The individual segments provide some rather interesting perspective of each of the postures. At first it seemed rather dramatic, but it really is helpful for explaining the background, benefits, and how to get into the posture. It explains how it affects the digestive system. Since the actual session does not explain verbally, it's very helpful that they included this section where you can practice each posture.

2. The Real Time Yoga Session. I LOVE this practice mainly because it does not include any verbal instruction. Each posture is first shown with the Sanskrit name and a stick-figure illustration, then a real person demonstrates how to get into the posture, then a bell rings to begin the hold of the pose. Each pose is held for 1-2 or more minutes, then the bell rings again. At first the bell startled me, but once I got used to it (and turned the volume down) I really enjoyed this non-verbal practice. There is no distraction of verbal cues and I was able to focus more on myself and my practice than the television screen. Once you go thru it a few times, you barely have to lookup to follow the sequencing..

I will use this DVD for years to come and follow the practice and re-play the verbal instruction portions as well.

Please check out my yoga DVD reviews on the other 2 in the series. Highly recommended as a different format than most Yoga DVD's on Amazon!  Namaste'",1356307200,5,3352,5.219330855018588
8361654,2,B002BNTSAW,"While, the yoga moves are shown in detail, the workout is only performed without instructions. The product description seems as if it has more than yoga (mind control, hunger control), however it has nothing like the such. Not too happy with it.",1304812800,7,245,4.857142857142857
