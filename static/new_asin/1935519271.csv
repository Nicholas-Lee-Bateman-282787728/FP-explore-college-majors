7801959,1,1935519271,"Mark Gungor teaches on the first disc that Christians seek God too much for direction.  He teaches they should just use their own free will to make their own decisions.  He also claims that God gave people free will, so they could make decisions without waiting on God.  I would never recommend these DVDs to anyone!",1455580800,,316,4.607142857142857
7801960,4,1935519271,"If you are used to Mark in front of an audience and combining lessons with entertainment, this will be different. It is Mark teaching and much more serious than his live performances. Still very good lessons and advice for those who are searching for answers.",1425945600,,259,4.777777777777778
7801961,5,1935519271,"You will either agree with Mark or think he is a heretic. He challenges the beliefs taught in modern Christianity about ""waiting on God's person for you.  Do you chose who you marry or does God? Whether or not there is a such thing as, "" the one"".  This video series is the exact opposite of what's being taught in Christian dating  books such as, Choosing God's Best"", by Don Raunikar ""When God Write's Your Love Story"" and ""When Dreams Come True by Eric and Leslie Ludy. After watching this series and previously reading those books somewhere between these two is the truth. Mark is just a lot more practical and deals with real life where the Ludy's and Dr. Raunikar take a on a spiritual God's ideal take. I think you can gain alot of knowledge and insight from both points of view.",1396569600,8,786,4.444444444444445
