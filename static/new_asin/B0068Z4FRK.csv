4979469,2,B0068Z4FRK,"I ordered these DVDs as a gift for my sister because I enjoy the series very much BUT unfortunately she was unable to view them because they are designed for British use only, I guess. They are useless to her. :(",1378339200,2,212,4.195121951219512
4979470,5,B0068Z4FRK,"I was unable to play the show as I am in the US and it would only work in the UK - a detail I was unaware of, BUT it was easy to return and I received a full refund.  I will most definitely purchase again from this seller and recommend highly.",1374710400,,243,3.673076923076923
4979471,3,B0068Z4FRK,"This product is not for the United States.  It is Region 2.  I bought it, and was very disappointed, and PB SHOP should have known I was not in the UK, but America.  They refunded me, and I bought this exact Doc Martin Series 1-5  another CD set that plays on American equipment, which is for Region 1.
We love Doc Martin, and it is the finest entertainment I have seen.  Do not buy this product if you are in America.  Thank you!",1372291200,2,430,4.120481927710843
4979472,1,B0068Z4FRK,Sounds great but is not compatible for using in USA. Had to return.  I would give it zero stars if that we're a category.,1367539200,,121,4.041666666666667
4979473,5,B0068Z4FRK,"Since I love my weekly installment of 'Doc Martin"", this entire series is great!  I am going to undergo knee surgery soon, with a long recuperation, so  my plan is to watch this series then.  I did have to purchase a new dvd player, for Region 2 dvds, from the UK, but that was worth it!",1361750400,7,287,4.089285714285714
4979474,3,B0068Z4FRK,"These DVD's would not play on my American Sony player! I was told they could play on other brands, but Sony's what I have at the moment.",1357776000,9,136,4.074074074074074
4979475,5,B0068Z4FRK,"This is the definitive Doc Martin collection comprising the five series which have been released to date. Doc Martin was aired between 2004 and 2011 and there have been a total of 37 episodes broadcast plus the extended 2006 Christmas Special. However, unfortunately the Special Edition is not included in this set (this is a review of the region 2 set).  As these are Region 2, they will not play on standard North American dvd players which are designed for Region 1.  However, they will play on a region free player.  If you have a Region 1 locked player it is worth googling to see if there is an unlocking solution as there often will be.

Doctor Martin Ellingham or Doc Martin was formerly a highly successful surgeon in a London hospital, who was forced to leave this job due to a fear of blood. He takes the job of GP in the sleepy Cornish village of Portwenn and is soon finding it difficult to relate to the locals due to what he considers his businesslike approach, but which is interpreted by those on the receiving end as standoffishness and a total lack of empathy and bedside manner. This extends to his personal life and his difficult relationship with the long suffering Louisa since he has very little in the way of people skills and a total inability to express emotion.

Portwenn is one of those places where nothing very significant seems to happen for a lot of the time, but which is inhabited by a gentle range of eccentric locals whom the stories are built around and the whole mix makes for very good and often quite amusing entertainment. Martin Clunes excels as Doc Martin and plays the part with a largely expressionless face except for the odd twinge of exasperation or irritation which occasionally crosses his brow. He has made this part his own and you really cannot imagine anyone else as Doc Martin. There is a very able supporting cast, but the principal characters have varied from series to series.

Although this contains the 5 series of Doc Martin to date, purchasers should be aware that Martin Clunes has recently indicated that there will probably be a sixth series and this is now confirmed for 2013. However, this will very likely be the final series. I would have thought that Doc Martin was one of those scenarios where it was possible to keep producing fresh scripts so personally I am certainly hoping for more!",1347408000,35,2359,4.6450839328537175
4979476,5,B0068Z4FRK,Very well made series.  Wonderful characters.  No stupid laugh track as in American comedy shows.  Note you need an all-region DVD player for this Region 2 version.  They are not as expensive as you might think.  Mine cost less than $50 on Amazon.,1418169600,,247,4.651162790697675
4979477,5,B0068Z4FRK,The Northern Exposure of Cornwall.  I love it.  It relaxes me after a long day at work.  Very light with quirky characters and beautiful scenery.  Also love the theme music.,1412899200,,173,4.666666666666667

4979482,4,B0068Z4FRK,"With a few cast members the English has produced another masterpiece.  The portions of disfunction are as generous as the sprawling countryside. I loved it however, after watching the series, I feel bad that the town's occupants was portrayed as such disfunctional klutzes. There was not one redeeming moment in that town.  They managed to screw up every function and even a funeral. The Clunes really should consider doing another series, if for nothing else to redeem the image they have left for this beautiful little town. No way those people are all incompetent idiots that just keep making themselves sick. I have to call it a tragedy because even though it is very funny, it's still sad and ends in such a sad miserable way. The doctor, regardless of his wife producing this should probable play up a more loving husband and lots more romantic moments with the lead lady, to end the series on a high note. His loving lines are so well done. Martin Clunes will definitely do an excellent job in this area, sooo talented.  I had to remove 1 star for the very bad ending.",1395792000,,1075,4.647368421052631

4979484,1,B0068Z4FRK,"I must be slipping ....... I ordered these without reading the reviews.  They are NOT compatible with DVD players that are sold in the USA.  Probably a fine set (and the seller provided what appears as good condition, used DVD's) but I get an error message - ""cannot play disc"".  Sending them back and am disappointed!!  I should have known better since they were quite a bit less than other 5 season Doc Martin collections (which are most likely the ones made for USA distribution).",1383177600,2,483,4.647058823529412
