6445291,5,B00KT5PAWE,"My background: I am at a pretty good fitness level; I exercise on average 6 times a week, using mostly Jillian Michaels' DVDs.  I have already mastered Jillian's 30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, etc.  With that being said, I am not a beginner and you might be wondering why I even ordered this DVD.  Well, I am scheduled for a minor surgery in two weeks; and although the surgery itself is minor, I will be on pelvic rest for 6 weeks during my recovery.  According to my doctor, NO EXERCISE whatsoever during my recovery (I even have to walk at a slow pace).  Not being able exercise for 6 weeks will definitely leave my muscles atrophied, and I will need to ease my way back into exercise once my doctor gives me the green light.  I pre-ordered this DVD in hopes that it will be a good workout regimen after my surgery.  And IT WILL BE!

I received the DVD today and I've already tried levels 1 & 2; and I previewed level 3.  As usual, the workouts are done in circuits.  Each level contains 3 circuits (doing each circuit 2 x).  Each workout is about 25 minutes long (including warm up and cool down).  Jillian does NOT utilize her famous 3-2-1 system here (3 min strength, 2 min cardio & 1 min abs).  Instead, these workouts are primarily strength training exercises; in fact, there are NO cardio intervals at all in levels 1 and 2.  However, my heart rate was still high at certain points due to the fast repetitions (and I used heavier weights).  The wonderful thing about circuit training (especially the way Jillian does it), is that you still pretty much get a cardio component during your workout due to all the different moves and supersets.  Jillian incorporates all the basic, yet essential strength training moves such as lunge variations, squats, arm rows, modified push ups, etc.  These workouts are total body strength training sessions.

But honestly, I really missed the cardio intervals, and I almost took down a star because of the lack of cardio.  However, I previewed level 3, and in that workout she DOES incorporate the cardio intervals (squat-punches, kicks, circle runs, mountain climbers, etc.).  So, I realized that Jillian probably took out the cardio intervals in levels 1 and 2 intentionally, so that the true beginners can build up their endurance.  This DVD is definitely more suitable for beginners as opposed to her other programs like 30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, Extreme Shed & Shred, etc.  But beware, if you are an absolute true beginner, or if you're very overweight, you may still find some of the moves to be too challenging (but who doesn't love a good challenge).

I definitely plan on following this 30 day program once my recovery period is over.  And I love how time efficient these workouts are; who doesn't have 25 minutes a day to exercise?!  No excuses!!

Note: my review may be a little biased because I admit, I am a huge fan of Jillian Michaels.  But that's because her workouts WORK!!!",1410393600,337,2934,4.613899613899614
6445292,5,B00KT5PAWE,"I was so excited to try this new workout.  I have done the 30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, and No More Trouble Zones and liked them all for various reasons.  I really let myself get out of shape, sadly, and this workout is exactly what I needed to motivate myself to get back in shape. I was hoping this would be a new, but slightly easier version of 30 Day Shred and that's what it feels like to me. Two of the ladies from 30 Day Shred are back- Anita and Natalie- and what I like is that you can tell they're working hard during the whole routine and it's more believable than in some of the other videos, where it looks like they're barely breaking a sweat.

In workout 1, there's a big emphasis on the arms, back, and hamstrings.  The ab work is manageable, and each exercise seems to fly by.  Jillian's tone seems a little calmer in this video- you can tell she's targeting beginners, as she speaks a little slower and her voice even seems to go higher at some points when explaining why each exercise is important.  She's still motivating, but not in a boot camp sort of way as she's been in 30 day shred. I have done workout 1 three times now, and every time it has gone by super fast.  If you're in a hurry to get your workout in and want it to go by fast, definitely try Beginner Shred.  I'm excited to try out workouts 2 and 3 once I've done this one a few more times.",1410393600,10,1374,4.100746268656716
6445293,5,B00KT5PAWE,Absolutely love it. It is different from the 30ds... Its more of a mix of exercises for shorter times. There are still circuits but they seem further apart. The warm up is quicker and not as exhausting. Th circuits consist of several different moves for 30 seconds a piece. I feel like there is more concentration on abs and butt than in her previous 30DS dvd.... And I've only done workout one so far loving the tushi exercises!!! Get this DVD ...it really is only 20 min. Her 30ds said 20 minutes but was longer. this is 20!,1410307200,22,526,4.377551020408164

6445297,5,B00KT5PAWE,"I have the 30 day Shred and that one is very hard on the knees for me. I never finished that dvd. On a sper of the moment,  I found this at the dollar store.  I figured,  why not? Its a dollar. I bought it. Started working out with it. I really like this Beginner one. It's easier on the knees, Jillian is nicer on here and I feel I can stick with this dvd until the end. I'm still on level 1. There's more strength than cardio, but I do like the step out jumping jacks. It is a workout, I know I will be out of breath and be sore. I am not a small person, I have at least 50 pounds to lose.",1522886400,4,591,3.6746031746031744
6445298,5,B00KT5PAWE,Workouts are doable yet still challenging enough to give a good workout and are pretty fun! I don't dread working out with this DVD so I end up working out a lot more than when I do the ones that make me feel like I'm about to die lol.,1521936000,2,235,3.816326530612245

6445300,5,B00KT5PAWE,WoW.  This is a great workout for beginners.  Definitely got my heart rate up and worked all my muscles.  I will continue using this and hope to move up to level 2.,1520294400,2,164,4.0625

6445303,4,B00KT5PAWE,Great workout . Not too hard and you can follow the easy workout or hard. Good views on how to do each. And the workout is only 20 minutes so not too long.,1518652800,,155,3.727272727272727
6445304,5,B00KT5PAWE,"I must be a true beginner based on reviews because I find the first workout challenging! Definitely sore the next day!

6445306,5,B00KT5PAWE,"Due to my artificial knee and subsequent leg alignment, there are certain yoga moves I cannot do without making my knee sore.  Many of the exercises in this video are straight from my PT sessions!  If anything starts to hurt my knee, I just substitute another move, such as crunches.  I can't jump, so the ""fly-out jacks"" are perfect for me. Thank you, Jillian, for making an exercise video for those of us with artificial joints!",1516924800,2,430,4.631578947368421

6445308,5,B00KT5PAWE,I absolutely love Jullian's DVD's. I feel this video would be great for beginners it's first of the 3 work outs is not SUPER hard and could be done by even your beginner.. Definitely one you want in your collection!,1516838400,,215,4.4
6445309,5,B00KT5PAWE,"I'm a big Jillian Michaels fan and have been doing her workouts for a while.  I've been rotating these dvds: 30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, No More Trouble Zones, Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, Killer Arms & Back, Kickbox Fastfix etc and have gotten great results. If you put in a consistent effort, you will see your body change in a good way.  I recently hurt my left heel/ ankle area so have been avoiding plyometric or high impact moves.  I bought Beginner Shred because it has no cardio workouts and is less challenging than JM's other circuit training dvds.  I think this is a perfect dvd for people who would like to start circuit training or strength training.  In JM's other workouts, the pace is very quick and you move from one workout to the next without pause. But in Beginner Shred, she patiently explains the moves and explains the benefits.  JM also has this going at a slower pace since it is meant for beginners so you don't have to worry about possibly hurting yourself from not having correct form because you were rushing from one move to the next.  This dvd is slower paced than I am use to but still an awesome and fun workout and JM does give tips on how to make some of the workouts more challenging.  I wouldn't recommend for advanced but intermediate would be ok especially by adjusting some of the moves to make it more challenging.  Also, its always good to have a ""lite"" workout for when you are recovering from an injury or don't have enough energy for a more challenging workout.  Good luck & keep at it & you will see results!",1516579200,3,1554,4.440140845070423
6445310,1,B00KT5PAWE,Does not wanna play on my DVD . Only a black screen comes up .,1515974400,,62,3.2
6445311,5,B00KT5PAWE,"The workouts are making me stronger following an injury to my back. There are enough modifications so I can workout without fear of re-injuring my back. I like how Jillian is encouraging and makes me feel good about what I can still do, while helping me get stronger",1515801600,,266,4.5625
6445312,5,B00KT5PAWE,"This is a great set of 3 workouts.  I started my fitness journey in a crossfit gym about 9 months ago, and did great.  I lost weight, built muscle, felt great!  But it was too expensive to remain after my introductory program ended.  Then I spent my summer training for a sprint-distance triathlon.  I'm still focused on becoming a triathlete, but I continue to need to build my core strength.  It's bitter cold right now, so it's hard for me to make myself go for a run or a bike ride, so I figured spending a couple of winter months focusing more on core strength and weight loss would not be a bad way to go.  I've been doing a few of the Body Revolution workouts with a friend, and discovered that I really like Jillian's style.  I want to keep my strength training low-impact since running is already going to stress my joints.  (I'm still trying to run once or twice a week, on days when it gets above freezing.)  Also, my husband needed to get started on fitness and MUST have low-impact workouts. So I figured we didn't need a big 90-day program and chose this cheaper option.  It's GREAT!  Much of the same stuff that's in the first phase of Body Revolution, but each workout is 20 minutes instead of 30.  I feel like I can find 20 minutes to start my day with it, I can rotate the routines (I'm already strong enough to do all three, but my husband will take it in order and might only do the first 2 for a while), or I can double up if I want more intensity or have more time.  Natalie and Anita help demonstrate a wide range of modifications. The three of them have good chemistry on stage.  Body Revolution is a great product too.  There are more models in that series--men and women--and it's very high energy, but this is a really great choice for people who want to spend a little less money to start off, who only want to devote 20 minutes to a workout,  or who want to stick with routines that are both gentle and effective.",1515110400,5,1942,4.276712328767124
6445313,5,B00KT5PAWE,"A great workout for those getting back into exercise, true beginners, and people recovering from injuries. I'm in moderately good shape but have chronic back issues that make a lot of ab exercises and twisting moves problematic - I've done both this DVD and her true 30 Day Shred and found that after one level-one 30DS workout my back would be in such a state I could hardly stand up straight the next day. This is so much gentler and yet still a great, tough workout. Level 3 is my favorite - all the moves feel great and challenging without hurting my back, and I actually feel more thoroughly worn out after a level 3 of this DVD than the 30DS because I spend most of my time ins 30DS trying to figure out how to do the move to protect my back. Most of the moves can be slightly modified to be easier or more challenging. This is a staple in my repertoire.",1514764800,,860,4.25
6445314,5,B00KT5PAWE,"I've never done home workouts consistently. I always seemed to get overwhelmed easily at other workout dvd's, but this one is amazing! Jillian is oddly very encouraging and helps me push through the burn. Quick workout that makes me sweat just as much as 30 minutes on the elliptical in only 20 minutes and I feel so sore.

My first exposure to this CD is from renting it from our local library -- via download.  You can only rent it for 3 days at a time - I did it for an entire 2 weeks.  I fell in love with the exercise and being overweight and older, this was perfect.  It wasn't too hard to do and something that was manageable.  It doesn't cause much pain and easier to do than some of the other exercises that I tried.

So I finally broke down -- probably because of the cost as well - and purchased it.  Great product and once I'm done with this review, on to start exercising.",1509926400,2,780,4.052287581699346

I'm sticking to it, and I can do 15 push-ups now (when I started I couldn't do even 1). Level 2 is not much harder but was less fun for me, so I guess doing some in a lower level is better than nothing. didn't lose weight but I lost a couple of inches so its a start.",1506729600,2,431,3.9655172413793105

6445326,5,B00KT5PAWE,"Though I used to frequent the gym, I have been out of shape for several years. In the past few months, I have worked toward getting back into shape with Zumba classes and workout videos for off days. The videos, for the most part, became boring quickly -- and my motivation waned. That has not been the case with this. I am not a connoisseur of workout tapes like so many other seem to be, but I can tell you this from my experience: this is a continually motivating, really hard but not boring program. I am sore in all the right ways and seeing improvement, a reward for the work. This Jillian woman knows what she is about. I would most definitely recommend this video. The moves are not difficult, but they are creative and EFFECTIVE.
*You will need to invest in some little dumbbells. I am using 2#, 3#, and 5#. Even at those low weights, I am getting plenty of exercise.",1505520000,,876,4.347560975609756

I've only done the first two of three, but was able to do both of them since this is less intense than most of her videos.  It is definitely for people who are less experienced with fitness, but the nice thing about it is that it is easy to 'level up.'  Almost all the moves are modified versions of more difficult ones.  If you are familiar with her workouts, just do the more difficult version.  For example, in this video, she has you do push-ups on your knees, renegade rows on your knees, etc... If you are experienced, just do them without the modifications and you've got a pretty solid workout!  The thing that I really liked about this video is that the pace is slower than most of her videos. It lets you really focus on the proper form and still work up a sweat.  So beginners, just do the video as shown.  If more advanced, do the full version of the moves and use heavier weights, and you'll be good to go!",1496448000,8,1089,4.278048780487805

She also says way too many times that she is not flexible and not to look at her during the stretches, but the other girls who can stretch really good and are flexible.  Do you think anyone notices that?  We are trying to do our own stretch.  She needs to take out any negative comment or lack of flexibility about herself.

6445351,5,B00KT5PAWE,"I think lots of people have already said this, but I'll add my piece - I agree that this is a great workout to start if you've been out of the workout habit for a while or are just starting. I did Jillian's 30 Day Shred about two years ago, then got slammed at work and fell out of the workout routine I had built up for almost a whole year. When I started back I was afraid that 30DS would be too much, and I was glad to find the Beginner Shred (I've had great results with Jillian's programs and wanted to stick with her). It's not the 3-2-1 system, but I like that there are still three manageable circuits and the intervals for each move are pretty short. It has been enough of a workout that I've had some of the post-workout soreness but not too much, and it wasn't so hard that I dreaded doing it most days. I'm 2/3 through it and will be restarting the 30DS after I'm done with level 3 of the Beginner Shred. I think I'll be ready for it at that point - I definitely wasn't ready before going through this program.",1494201600,3,1022,4.08955223880597

6445353,5,B00KT5PAWE,"I have completed 28 consecutive daily workouts (2 more to go!) so I feel like now is a good time for me to write a review. My backstory is that I used to be in fantastic shape and kind of let myself go over the past few months.  I'm in my 40s, am a working mom, and wasn't overweight.  I could just feel like I wasn't as strong as I used to be and things were getting a little saggy.  I had done other Jillian programs in the past so I know what her style is.  I LOVE this program! She shows a slightly gentler version of her ""America's toughest trainer"" persona.  She takes the time to explain good form.  You move fast enough that your heart rate gets ups there but slow enough that you can complete the moves with proper form.  The two women in the background have been in other Jillian videos.  I like that they have personalities, unlike some other fitness videos where the background people just smile like Stepford Wives!  One of my favorite things about these workouts is that they are packed with a lot of different exercises, i.e., you're not doing a hundred repetitions of each one, so you don't get bored.  Each workout is challenging, but by the 10th time you do it, it's easier and you're ready to move onto the next one.  After 28 days, and not changing my diet at all, my stomach is a little flatter and my backside is a little higher.  I'll be moving onto her ""regular"" 30-Day Shred next.  If you stick to this program, you will get results! It's difficult enough to be challenging, but it's do-able.  I love that she offers lots of modifications and doesn't make you feel guilty if you opt to do them.  Be warned that it's 20 minutes of actual work, but it's really 25 minutes because each workout has a warm-up and stretch.  If you are significantly overweigh, some of the floor work that requires you to lie on your stomach might be difficult but you could just skip those exercises.  There's not too many of them.  All in all, a fantastic program that WILL help you get back into shape!",1492732800,16,2007,4.335120643431635
6445354,5,B00KT5PAWE,"I really like this video so far, it's at a slow pace but still you can feel the burn. I am not one to have ever worked out but I cant wait to go onto the next step. Really excited to get more of her videos.",1492473600,,206,3.5
6445355,5,B00KT5PAWE,I am a 45 year old who had not worked out in a long time. I had very little endurance. This DVD is excellent for beginners- I never felt that I was in over my head. Jillian incorporates so many variations that it's also easy to challenge yourself and move forward. 20 minutes a day is easy and yet you do see results. Definitely recommend.,1491350400,5,339,4.230769230769231

6445357,5,B00KT5PAWE,"I love this workout video.  I am 54 years old and have let myself get out of shape and overweight.  This is a great workout for beginners or those that are overweight and haven't exercised in a long time.  I am able to do the exercises although the tricep dips are very difficult for me for some reason.  I noticed that after a few days it was easier to perform the exercises and I didn't get to the fatigue stage as quickly.  The first time I just watched the workout to see what it entailed, it seemed too easy but once I began doing it I could feel the workout and I was sweating like crazy.

This was the perfect choice for me to get moving again and to lose some weight and get in shape.  I highly recommend it and can't wait to purchase more of her videos. I can feel the subtle changes in my body already and I'm not finished with the entire 30 days yet.",1490227200,9,861,4.059171597633136
6445358,5,B00KT5PAWE,So glad I chose this as my first workout video.  I am 52 years old and was looking for something to ease me into working out  without putting me in agony.  The first few days I was sore however that went away and I can now keep up with Jillian.  I am just about done with the 2nd workout and I am looking forward to the 3rd one on this tape.,1490140800,6,341,3.76056338028169
6445359,5,B00KT5PAWE,"This is a excellent beginners work out.  I could feel muscles that I had not used in a while!  Jillian is a great instructor,

6445360,4,B00KT5PAWE,"Whenever I get busy at work & or I take on something new (like a college course, etc.) my workout tends to be the thing I have to sacrifice. My gym membership recently ended and I did not renew 1. because of the time it takes to drive there, change, hope I get a locker, struggle to get on the equipment I want to use. 2. the monthly cost, and 3. There are weeks if not months where it is impossible to make the time to go between work, kids (& their stuff), school, etc. So I decided perhaps it was time to invest in a few videos and take advantage of my living room space.

I needed something that was an hour or less, with enough cardio & body weight exercises to make it worth my time. Alas, I have the body type that requires copious amounts of cardio in order to lose and maintain weight. Gaining muscle isn't my problem (rather it doesn't take long), but losing fat is a challenge. And I hate cardio. I hate to run. But I need to do something as I don't wanna let myself go and I recognize now that my working out is going to have to be a priority.

After reading the reviews, I bought both this and the regular shred. I haven't been working out regularly these last few months so I wanted to ease back into it in an attempt to avoid being too sore and having to take immediate rest days. There is no shame in admitting you need to start off slow and build back up. Hence why I got the Beginner Shred first.

For the last few days I've been taking a yoga challenge in order to limber up a little. I use it as a warm up or a cool down. I started the Beginner Shred last night - following it up with one of my yoga challenges. So, in total, my workout was just shy of an hour with both workouts. There are three video levels in this product; each one allotted for 10 days (video 1 = 10 days, video 2 = 10 days, video 3 = 10 days) with increasing difficulty.

I was concerned I wouldn't be able to keep up but was surprised to find that Jullian mixes things up enough to where 1. I did not get bored, 2. I did not get lost, and 3. I got enough of a cardio workout to feel like I accomplished something and still managed to do 20+ minutes of yoga after to cool down. It was over before I knew it.

This morning I woke up with minimal soreness - a little ache here & there but nothing like what I expected considering the moves I did last night. I will be able to continue on without having to take a day or two off to recover. So for anyone who has kind of slacked off on their workouts or don't really have the time or $ for the gym but want to try to ease into something this is great. It's just you, Jullian and her team, ~20 minutes, you might want to invest in some 3-5lb weights, and no jumping jacks (at least not right away). I will update once my 30 days is up with my progress. I'm not intending to change my diet too much (as I'm someone who doesn't like dessert or sweets) and I try not to eat a lot of bread and pasta. I'm simply being mindful of portions and aiming for more natural foods (less processed meals). While losing some winter weight would be a huge boon, I'm more concerned about feeling healthier and toning up.",1489536000,6,3141,4.027243589743589
6445361,5,B00KT5PAWE,Did this this morning and it was fantastic. Made me sweat but was reasonable. Basic movements and really kept me going.

6445370,5,B00KT5PAWE,"I started this DVD a couple of weeks before Christmas in the hopes that I could get into a regular workout routine BEFORE New Years, and thus carry it through into 2017 instead of just starting a brand new ""resolution.""  Before doing this workout, I NEVER worked out at home, and only very rarely worked out at all. So with that being said, I have to say this video was awesome. It was just hard enough to feel like I was pushing myself but just short enough to make it easy enough to stick with it. And frankly, it works. I got used to working out regularly, and now I feel like getting a quick workout in is part of my normal routine.  So - for health purposes - that's great.  As another reviewer posted, I did not lose any weight, and I did not lose ""inches"" overall, but I could see noticeable changes in my body. My legs got tighter. My butt/saddlebags got tighter.  My triceps got less saggy, etc.  These weren't huge things that other people could see, but it was enough to keep me motivated and complete the program. And my husband said he could tell a difference.  Now I've moved onto the 30-day shred video, which is supposed to be a little more difficult, and since it's the same format as Beginner Shred I'm hoping I can stick with it all the way through the end too.  All in all, this video was well worth the $10 or whatever I paid for it.",1485993600,15,1354,4.245136186770428

6445374,5,B00KT5PAWE,"I'm currently on Day 16 of the 30 Day Beginner Shred. The only fitness  I had been doing was walking 2-3 miles 2-3X per week. Once winter set in I wasn't walking as much because of icy sidewalks and cold. I ordered this to do until I can get back out and walk again. I'm planning a trip to a warmer climate so I wanted to do this until then so I wasn't totally out of shape for my trip and could get out and enjoy walking while there.  I love it! I have never really loved a workout video before. They've always been a chore to me, but this one is easy enough for a beginner yet challenging enough that you can do the harder version if you're more fit. Some of the moves I can choose the harder version and others I stick with an easier version. There have only been a couple of moves I cannot do that I've had to modify. I just modify those couple of moves and continue on. No biggie. I'm still moving and I can see my body starting to tone up. I recently hit 50lbs lost but I'm still 35lbs overweight at this point. When I previewed the videos before actually doing the workout...I thought...there's no way I can to do some of those moves, but surprisingly most of them I can.

I've struggled to lose weight after my second child and she seems to be the only trainer/program I can even remotely stick to. I have almost every single one of her videos but this one is by far my absolutely favorite. I have noticed a HUGE difference in doing this. Please don't kid yourself.. doing this alone isn't going to make you lose weight. You need to eat healthier and exercise consistently. This in conjunction with better eating habits and being consistent is helping me reach my goal. I feel stronger and fitter and just better about myself.. more than I have in years. There are 3 different levels and there are modifications to all of the moves. She is SO encouraging in this one. I will be halfway thru a workout and want to quit and then she talks about how YOU matter and YOU are worth it and I am able to get thru the rest. I cannot say enough good things about this. If you are looking for a good beginner video of hers, this is the one. Hands down. You won't regret it.",1482278400,17,1063,4.293532338308458

6445387,5,B00KT5PAWE,"My background: I was a long distance runner in high school and have continued to run throughout college. However, I have always have had poor muscle tone in my upper-body, and so most videos like this are too ""difficult"" for me to do because my upper arms get fatigued quickly.

This workout is just the right length and intensity for a beginner exerciser, or for someone who wants to get back in shape which is where I am at. I am a full-time nursing student, plus I work. So for me this workout was nice because it worked my muscles and made me sore, but didn't exhaust me to the point where I just wanted to fall asleep and not study afterwards...which is one con of running long distance for your everyday workout.

I did not get winded or too out of breath during this workout. The core work and leg work didn't really challenge me at all. But by the end my arms and shoulders were shaky and sore. I plan on supplementing this workout video with Jillian's Yoga Meltdown and jogging 3-4 miles a couple times a week.",1480896000,,1019,4.3578947368421055

I would have to make my own modifications which made me feel even more out of shape(overweight) and honestly I would quit before 30 days. But Beginner Shred is great! I'm on level 2 and so far I can hold my own (aside from the tricep dips). I can do the moves, stay in form, and it's low impact. It's extremely motivating and coming from someone who hates exercising that is saying a lot! Beginner Shred is still a Jillian workout and is by no means a walk in the park, I'm a sweaty mess at the end, but if you're new to circuit training or have more than a couple lbs to lose this is a great way to get started!",1480464000,15,740,4.075342465753424

I own 4 Jillian workouts (Shred, Beginner Shred, Ripped, and Trouble Zones) and I mix them up depending on how much time I have and my energy level.

It focuses mainly on strength training in the first workout.  This is because in order to safely do harder workouts you have to build up some strength and endurance.  If you are a true beginner you will still get your heart rate up pretty well.  I have had a lot of experience working out but haven't done anything at all in a long time and, obviously, put on a LOT of weight pre- and post-baby.  I decided to start with this one because I know Jillian's workouts and figured the regular Shred might kill me.  I love her no BS, yet encouraging way.

These workouts are only ~20 minutes long but I was dripping sweat halfway through it.  I'm REALLY out of shape.  It felt good though and I know these simple circuits will help me build up enough strength to move on to harder stuff.  Also, just sort of FYI, if you have back pain then building up your core strength is really key.

Few months later, I had a MAJOR ankle reconstructive surgery. It's been 7 months since surgery and I'm still trying to regain full range of motion and strengthen my ankle. I quickly grew tired of my stationary bike and decided to search for something that would give me cardio and strength training, but not bring stress to my ankle. This morning, I remembered I bought this DVD back in January and never even took the wrapper off of it. I did my first workout today and let me tell you something! IT FELT GREAT!!! Modified cardio jumping jack (step jack), lots of squats, arm & ab work. Great full body workout. I'm still struggling with my balance, so lunges are a challenge.

I like the newer one, too, puts less stress on knees and gentler over all, though feels like it has less cardio and I'm not as exhausted by the end.  I chuckle that the two gals helping Jillian are in both videos, and are much skinnier in this new version. I don't like that, I appreciated their healthier looks in the older version.

The three segments are 20 min each and they get more difficult. So you can start with 1 and work your way up to 3. I aimed for 3 x a week at first and could actually see results! The fact that they're only 20 minutes each makes it harder to find an excuse not to do it. Almost everyone can spare just 20 minutes! If you're looking for an hour work out you can do all 3, although it doesn't really appear that's what it's meant for. They're similar but differ in level of how advanced they are -if that makes sense.",1471824000,4,680,4.082089552238806

6445415,5,B00KT5PAWE,"290 pounds, 5'9 woman, age 32- Began fitness journey July 15, 2016. Now down to 277 (August 17) and have lost 2 pant sizes and I have arm muscles and a smaller stomach! I feel so strong!

I love this video, it is amazing how I have progressed. Let me preface this by saying I don't think this is not an absolute beginner beginner workout. Let me explain. I am young and have worked out before. However, I didn't want any injury (been there done that).  I started walking with Leslie Sansone 2 weeks before I did this video. I wanted a fitness foundation where I didn't have to worry about being injured. Everyday I would do at least 30 minutes of Leslie's videos. They are awesome! I would and do vary the videos everyday.  My favorite is Walk Strong. In that video Leslie does 3 minutes of cardio and 3 minutes of strength training. Leslie enabled me to do the Beginner Shred. Leslie gave me the foundation. The Beginner Shred was the next level. I have been doing level 1 for 2 weeks. For me, it is best to do Beginner Shred after 1 or 2 miles with Leslie. If you are a big person, being warmed up for Jillian will enable you to have control of your movements better. The warm up she provides is very short. I am going to progress to level 2 soon. I have just now been able to do the 2, 30 second intervals of push ups with no break. So I am moving slowly and want to master the level before I move on. I will post another update after working with level 2. My weight loss was not through exercise alone. I only drink water now, but will maybe have a soda once a week. It really doesn't interest me anymore. If I go to have a burger, I will just get a burger no fries. I still eat what I want but do it in moderation. Yes, chicken tenders would taste better than a salad. But most of the week I go for the salad. If I want sugar I have a square of dark chocolate but I eat it slowly. Another important component is my doctor gave me a prescription for Adipex. I take this 5 days a week. It has given me control of my hunger and enabled me to make smarter choices. Like a salad instead of pizza. Updates to come.",1471564800,5,2113,4.099033816425121

6445418,5,B00KT5PAWE,Great beginner workout. I've stuck with it beyond the 30 days though I admit it was more like five times a week.

6445428,4,B00KT5PAWE,"This is a good starting dvd to the 30 day shred. It says Beginner shred, but you can't take beginner as meaning it will be simple. With any of her dvds you have to put some effort in. I started not being able to do any kind of push up , but at the end of the 30 days i was able to do a few modified push ups. I used 5 pound weights which may have not been a good idea since it made the exercises more difficult, but I powered through it. I did find that this dvd was easier than the 30 day shred and only a few moves are on both dvds.

Pro:
* Beginner Shred is easier than 30 day shred
* Your legs don't hurt as much
* Has more moves in each circuit making it easier to get through the circuit

Cons:
* She doesn't let you know what circuit you are in like in the 30 day shred. I believe she mentions it once when we are in circuit 3. You see the circuits during the 30 day shred.
* There is few abs and cardio exercises
* She talks too much sometimes (I keep the volume low and my music playing)",1468368000,,996,3.738095238095238
6445429,3,B00KT5PAWE,"These workouts are fresh and fun, but I wouldn't say they are for ALL beginners. The sequences done while standing are tolerable, but I felt like there were too many exercises done on the floor. I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia, so getting up and down for these parts were more than I could handle, and I'm not really overweight. My doctor insists that exercise will alleviate some of my pain, but these workouts only caused me a world of hurt for the following week. At first I enjoyed Jillian's encouraging comments, but sometimes she goes too far by insisting that literally EVERYONE should be able to do certain movements. She's probably not including the chronically ill and disabled, but it still made me feel bad about myself. On the other hand, I was able to get through the entire 30-minute routine by doing modified movements during the floor parts, which is impressive because I'm pretty sedentary.

A little back ground. I've been trying to run about 3-4 times a week before doing this DVD ranging anywhere from 1-2 miles. I was at least in some sort of shape when I started. There were definitely some moves that were very easy. but some were harder to do (Strength. I had zero upper body strength prior to this.

In the course of 30 days I did each workout at least 8 times within the 10 days per workout. Usually with a run before. By the end of this I actually was able to do exercises I would never had dreamed of doing before starting. aka tricep dips, MT climbers, etc. With dieting included I lost a total of 4 inches.

You're supposed to do 30 days consecutively of each level.. but that was too difficult for me. So I did it a few times per week and alternated with going to the gym. I started around 150 lbs (I'm 5'4"") and I'm down to 130 in large part because of this video. Now I mostly just do Level 3 along with going to the gym. I would also recommend 6 Week 6 Pack.. though I've only done the first level, it's def a step up from Beginner Shred Level 3. Jillian may be tough, but she knows what's up! Even if you aren't able to keep up the first couple times through.. stick with it. As long as you're moving you will get it eventually. In the beginning it was really hard for me.. and I never thought I'd be able to complete Level 3 but I did it! If I can, you can. :) Actually, Level 3 still makes me sweat hard.

I plan on letting a friend of mine borrow it, as she needs to lose weight, and I think this would be a great place to start!

While I haven't lost weight(I've actually gained, but I'm pretty sure it's muscle by the feel of it!), I feel much healthier, I feel like I'm more muscular, my stamina for working out has increased, and I can do things I never thought I'd be good at-namely planks and push ups.

As for those who stated it is not ""beginner"" I believe that it is... nothing ""new"" is ever going to be easy enough.

6445472,4,B00KT5PAWE,"So, after having not stepping into a gym in a decade, I started working out last year off and on with Jillian Michael's ""For Complete Beginners."" A month ago, I finally felt confident enough to try ""Beginner Shred.""

All in all, I found it to be an excellent DVD, but I am grateful I had experience with ""Complete Beginners"" starting out, because in that DVD a great deal of time is spent teaching proper form for things like Squats and Push-ups. While there is some emphasis on form in Beginner Shred, it is not as slowly and carefully explained. I also don't know that, as out of shape as I was a year ago, if I would have been able to get through the workout.

I do think that Jillian is encouraging on the DVD. She emphasizes the importance of just trying a little harder the next time. Pushing a little further. This gentle reassuring pressure has been really helpful to me when I feel like giving up. I also love that it is only about 20 to 25 minutes long, because I have no real excuse for not doing it. I mean, even on a busy day after work, I can usually find 30 minutes to break into a sweat (and you will sweat) and then hop into the shower afterwards feeling like I did something good for myself.

I also really appreciate that the exercises are low impact (I live in an apartment and try not to make too much noise exercising) and are fairly simple to do. There's lot of workout DVDs where I have literally fallen over trying to perform the moves. Some of the exercises from the First Workout are Push-Ups on the Knees, Forearm Planks, Tricep Dips, Squats with a Shoulder Press, Chair Squats with a Lateral Raise, Standing Lunges with a Shoulder Raise, and Bridges with a Shoulder Press, along with Bicycle Crunches and Donkey Kicks.",1460160000,2,1747,4.402476780185759

Im on my 3rd workout now and am thinking after I complete the 10 days doing that workout, Ill continue to use this DVD by alternating the workoutsone day do the first, then next the 2nd and the third day the 3rd workout and repeat.  You WILL see results if you do the workout AND watch what you eat.

I've been using this video for about 2 months and instead of progressing to the next videos, as suggested after 10 days, I have been increasing the weight amount and working on being able to do the exercises at 100%. In total I have lost 15lbs being on Weight Watchers and faithfully doing my videos. When I feel really good I like to do video 1 and 2. I will be purchasing another one of these DVDs for a friend as an encouraging gift once she loses 10lbs.  Hope this helps! :)",1459209600,2,597,4.283185840707965

6445486,5,B00KT5PAWE,"This is the second Jillian Michaels DVD that I have purchased. I decided to get this one after I fell head over heels for her ""One Week Shred"" DVD. I got kind of bored with ""OWS"" after a couple of months, and the reviews for this one were good, so I decided to buy it.

This was setup much like ""OWS"" in terms of having assistants to do modified moves for beginners and advanced participants. Once again, Jillian is motivational, but not annoying. At first, I had to modify some of the modified moves, but I could still do the majority of them! Being able to do what the trainer is doing gives me hope and inspiration. I'm always there, starting with the beginner, thinking, ""I'm going to be doing it that [advanced] way next week,"" and I start trying. Sure, I can't do ALL the advanced moves at first, but being able to do some lets me know that I CAN do this. Jillian is never overwhelming and she doesn't leave you in the dust like other trainers' DVDs that I've purchased in the past.

Yes, you're sore for a few days after your first session, but it gets better. Even though I was sore, I can honestly say that by the time I get to the cool down, I FEEL better. Instead of feeling exhausted or tired, I feel happy and accomplished, ready to take on whatever my day is going to throw at me. I would absolutely recommend this DVD to anyone that is looking for a great DVD to get you back on track or to get you started there. Yes, this says ""beginner,"" but some of the moves are challenging. They are challenging, but not impossible! Just stick with it. Jillian delivers on her promises!",1458950400,9,1590,4.296666666666667

6445490,3,B00KT5PAWE,"I used to do weight training when I was younger, pry up until about 40 years of age, but my lifestyle had changed and made it difficult to keep up with regular routines. I was diagnosed at 52 with breast cancer , had chemo, surgery, and then 2 years later had a hysterectomy. In the mean time that made it hard for recovery and the healing process was slow. Put on 30 lbs. since my cancer diagnosis.. For the past few years I have tried to get back into shape and do strength training, cardio, and even yoga, but had to space my recovery days and felt I was not making progress. Hormone changes in my body also makes it difficult to lose weight. When Jillian came out with a "" beginner"" workout, I said  ok, I'll try it. She says even if you're an out of shape ""Baby Boomer"" you can do this workout. I am now 59 years old.  Well, I discovered that I have weak knees and wrists. The static lounges , squats were even hard to perform and the tricep dips killed my wrists and forearms.(hence 3 stars for callng it a ""beginner"" workout) Otherwise, I could follow pretty good. Maybe make a few modifications here and there. I did feel weak and shaky the next day. Jillian  recommends doing this everyday for 30 days for results. Well, it will pry take me more than 30 days for me,  I will be resting in between workouts... Hope this review helped...",1458172800,9,1344,4.2795275590551185

6445495,5,B00KT5PAWE,"This video is no joke. I had just had my 10th baby and we were preparing to go on a cruise for our 15th wedding anniversary so, of course, I wanted to be in shape. As soon as my doctor gave me the clearance I started this video to help me out. I had read a lot of the reviews about how this one was easier on the knees and though I don't have problems with that area I didn't want to create any either so that was a pro for me. I debated on several videos and actually bought this one as well as an Abs DVD that Jillian has out. I did the Abs video first and then followed it up with this one and man did I feel it! The first day is by far the worst but it does progressively get better, if even only in the tiniest of doses. The way the video is set up you do the first workout for weeks and then the next for three weeks and then complete it with the third video for three weeks. I did it as instructed but pushed a couple days off of each video so I could be completely done by the time our sailing. After feeling like all my parts were going to fall off of me for a few days I finally started feeling like I was getting a hang of it and though I didn't see results right away I could feel it. When it was time to move to the next video I was ready but then of course really had to push to get through it the first day or two of trying it out. In the end I felt a lot better and looked a lot better and was ready for our trip.
I wasn't using this video to lose weight but rather to tone my body. After ten babies you just don't look like you once did. I am naturally skinny so weight loss wasn't a huge concern to me but looking good in my swimwear was and I obtained that thanks to this DVD.
The only negative thing I have to say is that it is pretty stressful on your wrists. I never had issues before but after using this video (and the other one I ordered) I have pain in my wrists and even have to use a wrist brace at times so I don't aggravate it further. I should have modified some of the exercises but I am one of those ""I can do everything"" type of people so I pushed myself too hard. Just stay mindful!",1457654400,3,2117,3.781038374717833
6445496,5,B00KT5PAWE,"I think everyone who does any of these workouts will understand when I say I have a love hate relationship with Jillian Michaels. I absolutely hate her when I'm doing the workouts. I curse and yell at her to shut up but after it's over I feel so accomplished.

 I have ripped in 30, killer back and arms, killer buns and thighs, extreme shred and this dvd and I have to say they are all amazing.

 Right now I'm doing Ripped in 30 level 4 on mon, wed, and fri. Then on tuesday and thursday I'm doing level 1 of this dvd and killer back and arms.

I'm almost 24 and was not in shape whatsoever when I first started working out. Had my first child a year ago and have been overweight since 6th grade. When this year rolled around I decided I wanted to change that and bought all the previous dvds listed (besides ripped in 30 which is my workout buddys dvd). I'm still nowhere near in shape but I can definately feel a difference when I workout. I can do more pushups, hold plank (on my feet too) for more then 5 seconds. I can keep up so much easier then when I started and I find myself not modifying the modifiers as much as I used to. I can even do 5 burpees now. That may not sound like a lot to most of you but to me that's a big deal. When I started I wouldn't even try them.

Now it's late and this review probably makes no sense but if you're a complete beginner and want a dvd to help you and push you i totally recommend this one. Even if you can't keep up and can barely do one push up, don't quit. Find that reason to keep going and push through it. It hurts and it makes you sweat and sore and feel digusted with yourself because you can't do the most basic moves but in a few weeks it'll start getting easier and you'll feel so much more accomplished after.",1457568000,6,1770,4.042857142857143

6445510,4,B00KT5PAWE,"I really liked this workout and was a great addition to my other work out routines which consist of running and Pilates. It's very easy to follow and you can go at your own rate whether you want more intense or a lighter cardio.

I knocked off a star because a few of the routines put your body in an awkward position that led to repetitive muscle issues in my neck/back. I talked to a trainer at my gym and showed her the specific moves on the video and she agreed that they were very difficult to get completely right and often caused the type of injuries I was experiencing. BUT a quick solution is to skip those parts :)",1456358400,,624,4.2
6445511,5,B00KT5PAWE,"I was never interested in doing this type of workout and never intended toin large part because I have knee injuries from being a runner in my 20s and was afraid of all the jumping and running in place, so I've long chosen low impact exerciseI just assumed anything like this would be impossible without pain. Over 2015 I lost 40 lbs doing cardio on an urban rebounder (indoor trampoline), traditional aerobic weight lifting (light weights, lots of reps & sets, quickly), and doing yoga. I hit a plateau for a couple months with weight loss and was also getting bored. YouTube suggested Michaels's ""Yoga Meltdown after my regular yoga video one day. I hoped it would be low impact & I gave it a trywhile it wasn't exactly yoga (and absolutely not for yoga beginners), it was a great workout, and zero impact. Impressed, I started looking into her other videos, and chose ""Beginner Shred"" because other reviewers mention its good for those with knees injuries. I like it a lot, and Level 1, at least, is low impact, and my knees are fine. I want to work out longer, so after a few days I added the regular ""Shred"" Level 1doing the two workouts in a row with no break to get 50 minutesand modifying the regular ""Shred"" cardio for my knees. It's just been a week, but I already see & feel good results (I also do traditional yoga daily, for total of at least 90 exercise minutes over the day).

I had not been super active other than caring for two kids and my knees are not the best so I wanted something low impact that I could work myself into.  This dvd was perfect!  The levels are hard enough that you see results but gentle enough to not feel overwhelmed.  I didn't think I would like Jillian as an instructor and she was surprisingly likeable.

I've been doing this exercise 5 times a week and also been just a teeny bit more careful with my food intake (less carbs at dinner, and salad or soup once or twice a week for lunch). Been applying firming lotion on my arms and tummy as well. I plan to lose a few more pounds and am very excited to continue on with this DVD. It's been 2  years since my 2nd pregnancy and it's time to get rid of my belly bulge. I highly recommend this workout!",1453420800,4,928,4.0710382513661205

This is the perfect video for those just getting into, or getting back into exercise. It up-beat, really easy to follow along with, and only requires you to commit to 26 minutes a workout.

6445546,5,B00KT5PAWE,"This program is absolutely perfect for anyone who has 'let themselves go', or is borderline overweight and out of shape and may not be ready to jump into a more intense workout program right off the bat.  I'm a 38 year old female, who used to be very athletic, but had put on an extra 25 lbs over the past few years.  This program really worked for me.  Each of the three workouts increase incrementally in difficulty.  I did each level at least 10 times, but not in 30 consecutive days.  I lost 10 lbs almost immediately before I even finished level 2.  This entire program helped me get back into 'intermediate' physical condition so that I am more prepared to move on to other exercise programs that would have been too intimidating had I attempted them without this initial conditioning.  Not only did I lose fat/weight, I actually see a transformation in my body.  I can actually see my obliques for the first time in a decade!  And, my arms and shoulders don't jiggle anymore!  I especially liked that even within each workout level, she also provides options for how you can do each move with varying degrees of difficulty.  I did find this challenging, and I was only ~25 lbs overweight.  I do think that if I was in a lot worse shape that this might not have been 'beginner' enough.  I recommend this to anyone interested in starting or getting back into a fitness lifestyle, whether you want to shed pounds or tone muscles.

I added this dvd into the mix 2-3 times a week (rather than the recommended 5 times a week), starting with workout 1, then alternating 1 and 2, then alternating 2 and 3. It's still tough, but I get better at the moves each time and need fewer/shorter breaks to catch my breath. In about 2 months, I've lost 4 pounds- but I was already thin, so 4 pounds is pretty good for me. I've gained muscle tone, strength, and endurance, and have been able to do the harder versions of most moves. Also, Jillian is pretty encouraging in this video, which I like.

It's short, so I can do it during baby's naptime, but it's good enough that I've been sore and have felt a difference.

I'm in my late 50s and can do this - and would never have believed I would ever be able to do 10 real pushups (not on my knees) - my arms and legs are so much stronger and are looking great!  I am thrilled and highly recommend.  Jillian Michaels is so motivating in this video.  Once I complete this I plan to move on to her other shred videos.  Love love love it!!!!!

6445566,5,B00KT5PAWE,"This is the perfect BEGINNER workout. I'm only nine days in but I did 30 push ups today - and on day one, I think I barely managed 3 push ups. Due to a horrible bedridden pregnancy I have spent the last two years inactive and just a few months ago had to do physical therapy for my hip and lower back. The 23 minutes really does zoom by and the next day your muscles are left pleasantly sore - as in you got a good work out and notice you actually have muscles - NOT the kind of pain where you can't walk for four days or wash your hair because you think your arms will fall off. I've skipped two days (so I could do a Yoga and circuit training class in person) and this video actually taught me how to modify moves for the classes I took in person. I think most fitness instructors don't actually know how to deal with people who are overweight and inactive or who have hip or knee issues. Jillian does know how to work within the above constraints and this video series is for people who are easing back into an exercise routine or starting one for the first time. It's a gentle, butt-kicking, sweat inducing workout - and I missed hearing her encouragement in the classes I took. To give you an idea how low-impact this class is I did it without a bra - not recommended for my body type! I'm not weighing myself as my goal is to get fit, not lose weight. My arms are firming up and I'm starting to get definition in my calves. I've never bought a home exercise video series and stuck with it for more than four days. I'm not panting and dying like Tae Bo or bored like the countless yoga videos I've sampled. This is a great mix of cardio and strength training.

UPDATE: I completed the 30 days and WOW!!! I shrunk a pant size in one month. I've continued this video series into month two (and now three!) but some days I go for a walk or do a yoga class - I've even taken a handful of days off (but I always aim to get moving every day). I've lost 15 lbs in about two months and I credit this video series for helping me on the road to fitness. I also ended up buying bigger weights. The first day, I used NO weights and gradually moved to 3 lbs, then 5 lbs and now I'm up to 8 lbs weights (although there are a few moves I have to go back down to 5# because ermagawd!).

So, I have been taking a break and trying to get back into exercising easily. Most of JM's workouts are so intense that a knee pain is bound to be the result. unfortunately, this is something that I'd feel the next day as supposed to during (so I can ease up). That said, I became hesitant to exercise but need to lose the weight as not to exacerbate the knee problems. I have been eyeing this DVD since it was in production but afraid that the workouts to be too easy as I have done many of her more intense workout routines. Glad to have purchased it because this is exactly what I needed.... lower impact but still very effective. I was sweating and sore the next day.

6445578,5,B00KT5PAWE,"This is a great all-round exercise video.  A bit about me: I used to be a personal trainer and in very good shape.  A couple of kids later and sporadic exercise habits over 5 years had left me in mediocre shape.  I had a good bit of residual muscle remaining, but cardio was poor, and a nice layer fat covered all the muscle.  I have tried out quite a lot of home workout videos (50 or so) and I like the strength/cardio ones best for results and dance ones for fun.  In the past, I have completed bootcamps, 5k and 10k runs, but I have been out of routine for well over a year or two now of doing anything really.

Workout 1: very nice all round strengthening video.  Light weights (I used 3 pounds for shoulder exercises and 5 pounds for chest, this was too light for me, but I didn't want to push myself too much in the beginning) and a lot of core/big muscle group strength exercises.  I felt really good and strong after these workouts.  This is a very modifiable workout.  At lower fitness levels, the step-outs, knee push-ups, and slight squats shoudl be fine for any beginner.  At higher fitness levels, full jumping jacks, full push-ups, and deep squats will provide a solid workout.

Workout 2: Honestly, this was a just-get-it-over-with workout.  In this workout, Jillian starts focusing on the smaller muscle groups more.  The first workout builds overall strength, and in this one she is targeting smaller muscles to exhaustion a bit more.  I really hated the static lunge that is held while doing one set of tricep kick-backs and then super-sets a set of reverse flys.  Not enjoyable to hold a static move for that long.  A lot of lower body moves, too many lunges for my taste.  I am fine with lunges, they are a great exercise, but when used often can be done in poor form because of tiredness.  I would just take this workout slowly and be careful with form.  It is a good, solid workout and will bring results. I used 5 pounds for the shoulder and tricep moves and 7.5 and 10 pound dumbbells for the chest/back/bicep moves.  I really enjoyed the deadlifts and renegade rows.  Those are not often on home workout videos.

Workout 3: Love this workout.  It is the shortest (23 min, the other two are 25) and it flies by.  Much more cardio in this one. I used 5 pounds for shoulder raises and 10 pounds for chest/back/biceps.  There is still a good bit of lunges that I would be careful of form, but overall this is a really nice workout.  Circuit 1 is primarily lower body, circuit 2 primarily upper, and circuit 3 mostly abs.  Each one mixes it up a bit, but that seems to be the main idea.  This is very much a boot camp style workout.

Overall:  I took 2 days off over the course of the shred, so it took me 32 days to complete.  I lost 2 inches off my waist, 4-5 pounds overall, and tightened up everything else.  I still need to lose some additional inches and pounds, but I can tell that I firmed up tremendously, which is far more important.  Everyone loves the scale, but really getting smaller and firmer is the main goal.  This is what everyone notices.  No one else sees those numbers on the scale.  This workout effective.  My only recommendation would be to swap out your weights.  I don't think it would be nearly as effective with just one set of dumbbells.  I think that one would end up light, for shoulder moves, and then chest and back would really be underserved.  It is a challenge to swap out the weights between moves as she does not give you any time or prompting, but it really helps to get a more complete workout. Overall, I highly recommend this workout.  It is exactly what a beginner or exercise returnee needs to build core strength and get in the fitness routine.",1443571200,101,3711,4.412979351032448

One of my favorite food bloggers (Our Best Bites' Kate) recommended a different Jillian Michaels system, but I thought for the price, I'd try this one first and I am so happy I did! When I started, it was super challenging, and I was pretty certain I was going to die, but I stuck with it for 5 days a week. I also used the MyFitnessPal app to track calories and a Jawbone Up Move to encourage more activity throughout my day. This video gave me the start and confidence I needed to really change.

Like other reviewers have said, don't be fooled by the ""Beginners"" reference here. I have been working out religiously 5 days per week for over 3 years and this video made me feel the burn and ""after-effects"" the next day.

I am what I call a ""cardio queen"" because  I am almost daily doing one of the following: running, swimming and biking. I bought this video because I wanted to see if weight training would lead to better ""times"" in the swimming portion of my training. After doing this video for a month ( I stuck to the first video for a month - now I am trying the 2nd one), I am seeing results, both in my swimming times and in my muscle tone.  I have lost one pound over all. The first two weeks I actually gained two pounds. So, if this happens to you, hang in there!

Sadly, a few days ago, my cat decided that this DVD was a new toy and chewed on the corner of the disk. Bad Kitty! Granted I should have placed the DVD in its case right away, being that my cats are like toddlers, but atlas, I did not.

It is the perfect level for me and a great alternative to a full hour of Zumba on days when I don't have much time. Looking forward to progressing through the other two levels. The only thing that could make it better is a tropical setting in the background. Jillian is a great teacher and she has a very positive and inspiring personality that doesn't seem fake or forced.

6445650,4,B00KT5PAWE,"It's tough for me to give this a solid rating since I tried this out for the first time this morning.  I plan to update as I move along her program.

About me...
I dislike workout videos, I'm terrible at them. Typically, I'd get my exercise at the gym via treadmill, elliptical, and weights.  After I dropped my gym membership, my level of fitness dropped dramatically - which I figured, but just didn't realize HOW dramatically.  A couple of weeks ago, I took a riding lesson for the first time in a long time - WOW that was my wake-up call.  My muscles gave up on me and my stamina was terrible so I struggled.  It was just a pathetic lesson, so I needed to DO something about it rather than complain.  Knock on wood; I've never had major health issues, or physical limitations that would prevent me from using this video.  So, I'm not a stranger to working out and I enjoy physical activities.

This Video (Level 1)
One thing you should note is you will need hand weights.  Nothing too heavy, I think 2 or 3 lbs to start with will be fine.  We definitely see Jillian's warm/fuzzy side, as mentioned in previous reviews.  You know what, that's fine with me.  I like Jillian's ""typical"" style, just not ready to get yelled at.  Being that she is Jillian, she does push you from time to time. As another reviewer mentioned, there's little cardio incorporated into the workout, which is true.  However, there's some cardio during the warm up and there's no rest between exercises, which keeps you moving.  At the end, my heart was pumping and walked away feeling I can handle this. If you have never worked out before, I think this video is a great starting point, as it will challenge you, yet it's not intimidating.

If you have worked out in the past, the degree at which challenge you will depend on your current level of fitness. I think the purpose for Level 1 is to get you strong enough to advance to full versions of these exercises in levels 2 & 3.  For example, she takes you through modified push-ups (push-ups on your knees), so if those are too easy, you could do full push-ups instead.  She also takes you through partial squats, so if you need a challenge do full squats. Get it?  So, if you're getting back into working out after a few months, this will still be good for you to try.",1433376000,9,2299,4.415676959619953

I've done several of her other DVDs (Body Revolution, 30 Day Shred, etc) and loved them. However, I was not a fan of this. The workout was still strenuous for a ""beginner"" workout. While I didn't expect her to go easy, she still went harder than I thought. I had also gotten used to breaking up the muscle groups into ""push"" and ""pull"" muscles, as she does in Body Rev. So to work out all the muscle groups on the same day everyday no longer felt natural. Overall, this is a DVD meant for someone with more of workout history and endurance/strength. Her beginner is more beginner-intermediate.",1432166400,8,689,4.390625
6445657,4,B00KT5PAWE,"Hell has frozen over and pigs are flying because I have been working out for 32 days and I don't hate it.

I haven't worked out in well, ever. I bought this to gear up for Jillian's ""30 Day Shred"". I am way out of shape (need to drop 45lbs but more so just not ""physically fit"") so I needed something to get me in gear so I didn't crash and burn. As a beginner video it's still a bit hard if you aren't used to working out. It doesn't tell you but you need some hand weights. I had 2lb weights lying around waiting for me to finally get serious about working out. They were a bit light but a nice place to start.

Each level has a warm-up followed by strength, cardio and abs, then a cool down. Jillian does the moves along with her 2 girls from the ""30 Day Shred"" video so it's nice to have them to follow through the 2 programs.

Tips:
Bought this as a download and watched it on my ROKU. The newest device has an Amazon button so that made it super easy to queue this up.
It took me a while to understand what they were doing on some moves and that took time from the workouts. It's best to watch them through first and try to mimic the moves once. I didn't get it all down the first few times through even after a watch-through but I was so winded it didn't matter. I was glad to stop for a second to get back on track. For best results though you should try not to break if you don't really need to. Jillian will reinforce this and motivate you to push through it (although this is a nicer, calmer Jillian). She will also remind you about your form which I needed.

If you have bad knees, etc. watch for the modified ""easy"" versions of the exercises. If you find it to be too easy then follow the advanced girl. I flipped between them depending on the move. My legs weren't up to the many lunges she gives so this was a bit hard in parts.

Count the reps in each move. This will help you flow to the next section with more ease. I wasted a lot of time in between moves after realizing they had moved on and I was focused on what I was doing. I still don't move as fast as them and I lost time (and reps) trying to gather up my weights and get to where they were.

Results:
I did 10 days of level 1 and 10 days of level 2 with 2 days off when life had me too busy (it's 25 minutes so that's a bad excuse). There were some moves that I never really quite figured out if I was doing correctly. I decided that after 3 days on level 3 that I was going to just try jumping to her next workout series""30 Day Shred"" and take a crack at level 1. I think that level 3 of the ""Beginner Shred"" and level 1 of ""30 Day Shred"" are very similar so I finished out the remaining 7 days and am now working on 10 days of level 1 ""30 Day Shred"".

I see the most results in my arms (baby muscle bump is forming and that's so cool!) but I haven't weighed myself. Clothes still fit the same, maybe a tad looser. I think I look more toned all over. My endurance is much better though and I think this is the main goal of this video. You won't shed massive weight in 30 days with the ""Beginner Shred"" but you will be able to last through a regular workout.",1431993600,10,3135,3.9509493670886076

But as years have gone by, there are times I would like a gentler, slower paced workout. I was hoping Beginner Shred would fit the bill. However, it was way too slow and at the end of workout 1 and 2 I was frustrated. I'm sure this is a good workout for anyone who has never worked out before, but if you're already in good shape, I would avoid this one.",1431820800,3,476,4.021052631578947

6445668,5,B00KT5PAWE,Love that Anita and Natalie are back (they are in the 30 day shred)! This workout is definitely not as hard as the 30 day shred but will help you get in shape when you are just starting out. I have been working out consistently for 3 months (5-6x a week) and this is too beginner for me now. It definitely helped in the beginning though when some of her other workouts (such as 30 day shred) were really hard. I would recommend this if you are looking for a workout that isn't a ton of jumping around and still has strength and abs in it.,1430265600,13,538,4.084905660377358

Just add heavier weights and a high-impact cardio move in place of the low-impact ones and it's a great workout. Also, I was concerned that Jillian's high-pitched voice would be irritating, as stated in other reviews.mit was actually a pleasant change, and not annoying at all. Not that I don't love tough Jillian :) Anyway, this workout is great. So glad she made it.

Small edit: This workout can stand on its own as well. On days where I don't have a lot of time, I do this one. I prefer DVDs with more lifting than cardio and this is definitely like that.",1429574400,4,723,4.395522388059701

Often, it can be a struggle to keep up with her and continue to do the workouts day after day. This is different as it is easy to do everyday (it's only 20 minutes!) and it is a lighter intensity so it's not harsh on your knees which is why I got it. I've injured myself several times while working out but I still want to exercise without being nervous of hurting myself once again.

Then on June 2 of last year I got sick, and was unable to work out, let alone go to work or get off the couch for seven months.  Thanks to God and excellent medical care, I am feeling much better and am ready to try to get back to living life again!  This workout is tough!  Fifteen minutes in, the sweat was dripping off my face onto the mat!

When I bought this, I was curious to see how different this was from 30 Day Shred. You'll see some of the same moves but combinations of other moves. This is definitely gentler on the knees.

I love that it's 20 minutes. She really economizes and packs a lot in 20 minutes.

Jillian has several DVDs recombining a lot of her best moves to impact areas of the body in a more effective way, whether it's ab-focused, total body focused, fat-burning focused -- anything. Whatever your current fitness level, she has a DVD for it.

She seems pretty dedicated making sure no one has an excuse for not working out.",1427673600,9,756,4.5036496350364965

This is a great workout that I could do while my daughter was sleeping or when it was too cold to take her outside to run with her. I gave it a 4 star rating only because I think working out for 30-days is kind of unrealistic for a beginner DVD. I hadn't worked out for about 6 months, so I got REALLY sore during workout 1.

6445727,5,B00KT5PAWE,"I bought this after trying it for free through hoopla (through library).  Id been in a rut for a long time, just doing the elliptical machine and very few weight exercises.  So I wasn't totally out of shape to start out, but hadnt had any good training for a long time.  This was the perfect level for me to get back into shape.  It would be challenging, however, for someone quite overweight and sedentary. (Challenging, but not impossible; she cant tell through the screen if you really cant quite do everything she asks of you; just do the best you can). I really like the pace and the fact that most exercises work several muscle groups, making the most of the 20 minutes.  I felt that Jillian made good choices to keep us safe but pushes us to do the best we can do.  When I finish this series in a few days, Ill probably get more of her DVDs.  Even though her voice is a bit abrasive and the music is uninspiring, who cares if you're working efficiently and getting fit?  Refreshingly absent are the warnings you see in many exercise tapes telling you to first consult with a doctor.  She instead tells you you're safe; shes got your back; unless you have an injury you're not fragile; you can do it.
You need a yoga mat and hand weights.  I'm using 5 lb weights, which are a bit heavy for a couple of the exercises, as it's important to keep good form.  It would be a good idea to have a couple different sizes of hand weights.",1424736000,11,1434,4.29368029739777

Yes it does say beginner, and it is very difficult, but that does not mean it cannot be done by a beginner. Jillian encourages you to work at the level you are comfortable doing, and to increase when you are ready. It is broken up into 3, 10 day rounds. My first work out I could barely get through it, huffing and puffing all the way, while my 12 year old gymnast daughter worked out with me. The second work out it got easier, and so it did until we started 2nd 10 days. The second round was far more difficult, but again working at our own pace I was able to complete it. We are starting round 3. I have lost about 8 lbs in the the 20 days, my body is more toned and I feel great.

This one is no different, I thought since it is coined as a ""beginner"" level that it might go a little easier on the knees but I was unfortunately wrong. I still experienced sharp pains in my knee during the workout even with the modifications. If you have knee problems like me then I would suggest that you don't bother with this one.

I did have to stop and start a couple of times but I could see myself not having to do that after a week or two. I don't plan to follow the daily regimen and go up a level every 10 days. Since I'm so out of shape I want to ease my way into it. The length of the workout is perfect.

I could see how this workout would be too difficult for someone who has a bad lower back or knees since the planking or pushups or some of the moves could be hard on both of those areas. If you are weak in the upper body you may want to omit the weights on some of the moves or if you are stronger you can use heavier weights.

Don't fool yourself, though - this may SAY it's ""beginner"", but she'll STILL KICK YOUR BUTT (but in a nicer, gentler way, for those of you who may not like her usual tough demeanor in her more difficult workouts!)! I started with ""30-day Shred"" about 5 years ago, LOVED it but eventually got bored (still an extremely effective workout, but just needed a little variety and challenge), then moved on to ""Ripped in 30"", which was TOUGH and I did NOT look forward to doing, but, MAN, it got me in the best shape since my early 30s (and I was 44 at the time!!)!! (I've always been physically active and strong, so it wasn't a ridiculously difficult task, but it did take about 6 months or more of almost-daily Ripped, plus walking my dogs twice daily!) Unfortunately, age and joint injuries started kicking it last year (shoulder injury I STILL haven't gotten over, and it's been almost a year!!), and I had to give up Jillian, which (truly) made me so sad and disappointed and frustrated (oh, and jiggly). My husband saw how depressed I was getting (I missed being active and strong!) and bought me the Bowflex MaxTrainer, which is ALSO tough and challenging and provides significant changes pretty quickly (and is NO impact, so it didn't hurt my knees at all) - BUT, it ONLY provides a lower-body workout (plus cardio), no arms or core, and it just didn't feel like ENOUGH! So.....I considered adding in a little Jillian again, but with my joint issues, just wasn't sure how I'd be able to do that (especially cardio segments, which were starting to bother my knees....), but I REALLY wanted to TRY, and figured maybe I could just modify the existing exercises (on the DVDs I already owned) a little, avoiding doing anything that hurt my joints (really, would that even be possible with a Jillian workout??). I had loaned the 30-day Shred DVD to a friend, so I figured I'd just download the video to my laptop and work off of there, when I spotted this NEW Beginner Shred video!! WHAT?? Didn't even know it existed!! Downloaded it IMMEDIATELY and tried it IMMEDIATELY, and I was NOT disappointed! Despite my multiple joint issues, I got through the whole workout (Level 1) right away and FELT AWESOME!! Now, because I had experience with her other videos and was still pretty fit (but jiggly, with probably a couple of extra pounds), I did do the more advanced version of some of the exercises, but even if I hadn't, I still would've gotten a good workout. Unlike her other videos, there is no 3-2-1 approach (3 minutes of cardio, 2 minutes of strength, 1 minute of abs), but that's fine, because I still think you get a decent cardio workout (since there's no rest between sets) and I still plan on doing the MaxTrainer on alternate days. Also, NOT having the jumping-around/hard-on-my-knees cardio actually worked BETTER for me. What made me feel REALLY great was hitting all of the muscle groups I HADN'T been hitting for so long, even if just lightly using light weights! And, MORE IMPORTANTLY, the CORE WORKOUT I'd been missing! She is AWESOME at WORKING YOUR ENTIRE BODY with the way she arranges and coordinates the exercises, and I felt STRONGER AND BETTER THAN I HAVE IN A LONG TIME!!!

I decided to start with Jillian because she looks amazing and I had heard good things about her workouts from others.  I consider myself a complete beginner at this point.

A lot easier on the knees, not as much quick up and down and you still get all the benefits of a great workout short workout. This video is a lot better with the modifications and Jillian really explains how you can pace yourself now and push yourself for the next time which is great because the changes the workout and keeps it from being boring.

I found that I could modify to the harder exercises and use 8 pound weights, rather than the 2 pound weights they use in the video, and get a really good workout right at home.

I do not think that is accurate. I'm about 30 pounds overweight, and I walk a mile or two at lunch on trails near my work. I need to get in better shape, but I am young and active and not a crazy obese woman. It was really hard for me. Sweat was pouring down my scalp and I was winded and I couldn't finish it. That said, I do sort of like Jillian. She's kind of crazy and funny and she gives you a mini lecture on emotional intimacy in the middle which is funny.

6445771,4,B00KT5PAWE,"Beware of how the reviewers here have defined ""beginner"" because most of them assume a beginner is someone who was previously in shape, but just dropped off the fitness cycle for a while.  For those of you who have never worked out (ever) or for those of you who have more than 50 pounds of weight to lose, this may not be the best choice for you.  Try Jane Fonda's latest workouts or Richard Simmon's for a real beginner level.

If you really want to do this, you need to be able to do at least the following (even in level 1) without having your body get in the way:

1. Squats
2. Lunges
3. Pushups (the modified ones are still on the floor)
4. Tricep Dips
5. Planks
6. Bridges
7. Crunches

You can modify most of these by making the movement as small as possible.  For example, do 2 inch squat wherein you lower your body only 2 inches during the squat exercises, or do wall pushups and planks.  If you do this workout often enough (at least 2x a week), you should see improvement in terms of increasing the amount of movement for each exercise.  You just might have to stick with the level 1 workout for a while until you can get to the point of doing regular pushups/planks/squats, etc.  Then you can move on.

That all being said, this is a great workout for building up strength and increasing fitness level, hence the reason so many ""return to exercise"" reviewers like it.  I am not a fan of Jillian's other DVDs primarily because of her ""gotta be merciless"" attitude in those DVDs, but this one is different.  If Jillian quit The Biggest Loser because they always made her out to be a boot camp drill Sargent, then I would say this DVD is probably closer to the reality of Jillian.  She doesn't hold your hand, and she doesn't abuse you.  She's great with the techniques for each exercise, and she makes you responsible for your own level of effort.  Sustainability is the goal here, and it shows in how she's put together the workout into 3 circuits with each one repeated twice and a small active rest between.",1419465600,222,2021,4.380697050938338

6445788,5,B00KT5PAWE,"I have tried innumerable forms and ways to lose weight, to no avail. Controlling what I eat, frequent exercise, clean eating, swimming...you name it, I've done it. Mind you, I am a woman of 23 years of age, and you'd think that would be an advantage! I have been overweight for most of my life, since I was 9 years old because my grandparents thought my very slight 70 pound frame needed filling. I went from 70 to 120 in the same year being fed frosted flakes with condensed milk and fried food because my grandparents thought my being so skinny had meant I was sick. Because of their love and concern, I've struggled with self esteem issues, lack of vitality, and a consistent 50 lbs overweight from then until now. I started doing the 30 day shred about 3 years ago, and I had to stop on level 1 mid-week because it damaged my knees severely and it took over a year to recuperate. I tried Leslie Sansone, FitnessBlender,Beachbody, Zumba, PopPilates, so many things, and while they are all very good, I knew any workout with Jillian would offer their individual benefits all in one. So I persisted. And gained weight in the process. I now have an incredible body shape, a natural, very toned hourglass, no lose bits, just neat, but I weighed 192! I look like I weigh 160 and no one believes I'm 192 due to my large bone mass, despite my 5'3"" height. In the past 5 years, I've gained 30 lbs of muscle. Until this.

 I've been working out to this in the last 2 weeks and I've lost 8 pounds...on level 1. I haven't followed her plan to a T because of my weak knees and because I am trying to train my body so I don't hurt myself. But still, the results speak for themselves. This is my first amazon review ever, so pardon if its not as lively or whatever a review should be. But I want to thank Jillian Michaels for taking time to create a workout program for those of us who have desperately have wanted to get started but have been underwhelmed with options. This video is motivating, inspiring, strengthening, and it gives you a sense of purpose. You know how some workout videos leave you defeated? This is the opposite. On a good day, I've done the same workout 4x in one sit down! You break a good sweat, have a great time, and feel powerful. As clich as it sounds, I cried when I was able to do a full push up and not feel pain. I can now run stairs without puffing. A 30 minute mile has now become a 16 minute one, in one week. I sleep better. I lost a clothes size. With just level 1. If you are reading this Jillian, please make a follow up. Please, please, pretty please!! Just a transition video, going from this to maybe an intermediate, something that wouldn't hurt the knees. Please ;). Anyways, if ANY of you are looking for a great beginner video, this is it. You get fast results, perfect cuing, comprehensive instructions and modifications, and a motivating yet challenging Jillian, just like we like her. Outstanding job Ms. Michaels.",1416355200,69,2953,4.396709323583181

I've always needed a little more strength training in my workouts so I thought this would be good. Overall, it is good. I progressed and it made me feel stronger as I got better at the workouts. I was sore a lot more than I thought I would be. Unfortunately, there were no magical results at the end. I did the workout 5 days per week, 30 times, and after all is said and done, I gained 2 pounds and lost NO inches. My clothes fit the same, flab seems untouched. I didn't change my diet during this time and my diet tends to be pretty good. So overall, I'm glad I'm working out again but if hoped to get rewarded a little more for my hard work!

I have been working out at home (weights and treadmill) for months and just started a gym membership...but this little 20 minute work out kicked my bootie in a good way. what I really enjoy about her work outs is that she goes right into it...There isn't a long boring useless introduction and before you know it, the work out is done. Im looking forward to keeping my commitment to the work out. I bought all three episodes, but have only tried the first one for now. Its pretty hard to talk yourself out of a 20 minute work out. I will agree with other reviews...anyone can keep up at any level of fitness with this work out. I have done some of her other dvds in the past and she never disappoints. I was sweating 10 minutes into the work out. this was truly money well spent.",1414540800,5,815,4.298701298701299
6445798,5,B00KT5PAWE,"I have every single Jillian Michaels DVD. This is by far my favorite, and I'll tell you why. I am 46 years old. In the past, I've had a knee injury and a rotator cuff injury. In January of this year, I lost 10 pounds, but strained myself kickboxing and ended up with a back injury and bursitis in my right hip. Frustrated and depressed, I stopped working out and gained the weight back. When I preordered this DVD, I had no idea that it was going to be the key to get me back into working out again.

This is true--I have lost ten pounds in a month and I'm on the seventh workout of level three. I can tell you that my legs, arms, and abs feel incredible. I have more stamina, and just this week I have biked twenty miles every day! I am so fired up and feel like my old self again. I was truly afraid to work out after all these injuries, but this DVD allowed me to wade my way back into working out.

I appreciated that Jillian gives low impact choices this 3 level DVD. The thing about my hip and back are this--they seem ""fine"" until I jump around and it's not until later that I realize I've overdone it.  She takes you through each exercise nice and slow, and the time goes by quickly. Yah! No more injuries!!!",1414540800,130,1216,4.100840336134453

6445803,4,B00KT5PAWE,"Having done several of Jillian's DVDs in the past with great results, I was excited to try her Beginner Shred DVD. After taking a 3-month hiatus from high-intensity workouts due to a busy schedule (and I'll admit, a little laziness), I was ready to get back into the swing of things. However, I was scared to start with some of her more advanced DVDs like Ripped in 30 and 6 Week Six-Pack (which I love) simply because I knew that my strength and cardio abilities were not up to par. That being said, let me get into this DVD.

The workouts are 20 minutes long (a little longer with warm-up and cool down), which I think is great for a beginner DVD. Jillian still packs a variety of moves into the 20 minutes and still makes you feel like you got a good workout. After doing the first workout, I was a little disappointed with Jillian's style because, as others have mentioned, she does seem to be a little too nice. Maybe that's because I'm used to her style from her other DVDs, but it's not really an issue. What's more worth mentioning is the fact that I was sore after the first workout, even though it was only approximately 20 minutes long! I was impressed!

After doing all three workouts I can tell you that they do progress in terms of the level of difficulty. Also, the third workout has more cardio intervals than the first two. Overall, I think it's a great DVD to get people back into exercising and I look forward to working it into my routine when I either want an easier or shorter workout. However, I am subtracting one star because I was looking forward to Jillian kicking my butt a little more in terms of motivation.",1413590400,23,1637,4.399339933993399
6445804,5,B00KT5PAWE,"I'm in my early fifties and let myself get very out of shape, so working out can be very difficult.  I needed to find something I could enjoy that would still push me to work harder.

Workout 1:  You don't spend much time on any set of exercises and quickly move to the next.  You may find yourself thinking, ""Is that it?""  This workout is deceptively ""easy"", yet I found myself sweating like crazy.  I noticed subtle changes in my body after a few workouts.

Workout 2:  Same as the first video, you spend a comfortable amount of time on each exercise.  Not that it's easy, it's just each exercise seems to end just in time ~ as you reach, or right after you reach, muscle fatigue and can't go any further with good form.  This workout is definitely tougher than Workout 1, but it's doable and, dare I say, enjoyable.  I sweat buckets with this one and feel it the next day.  Changes are more apparent now (waist is really pulling in, clothes are looser).  I actually love this workout.

Workout 3:  Haven't made it this far yet, but I've already lost about 8 lbs.

This DVD is perfect. I find it manageable with the option of increasing the intensity within each work out over time. A lot of great basics for a good all around work out in the span of 20 minutes. Jillian is gentler in this. I've always liked the interaction between her and the other women in her DVDs. They feel like old friends now.

It was like she was looking through the screen when she said, if you used to be in really good shape or have gained weight, this DVD is for you. I used to run marathons and be in great shape. Because of 3 operations, I gained 40 pounds (yuck!) I used to do Jillian's regular workouts but just couldn't get through anymore - so I decided to buy this Beginner Shred thinking it would be very easy and get me back in the groove. Well, it is terrific and challenging! I run 2 miles and come home to do it. I've been sore in all the right places, and I feel a world better! It is amazing how much Jillian fits into 20 minutes. Jillian does circuits then cardio and mixes it up. There are 2 background exercisers (with very inspiring physiques like Jillian.)

Level 1 and 2 are just strength training-3 circuits. Level 3 was strength training and cardio and made me sweat. The workouts were more 25 mins each and not 20. This is a warm up and cool down.
I consider myself on an intermediate fitness level, but I will be keeping this dvd to do on days when I want an ""easier"" workout. I love her enthusism and kindess in this dvd and I LOVE that she doesn't cuss so I would consider this a family friendly fitness dvd.
Well done Jillian!

6445819,3,B00KT5PAWE,"As a Personal Trainer, I find these to be a really good, low impact workouts for a beginner (hence the name - Beginner Shred). It's very similar to 30-Day Shred (even have Anita & Natalie back!), but lower impact (NO impact in the workout 1).

The only issue I had with it, was that Jillian was NOT herself at all. Unlike in the Biggest Loser gym, she is usually GREAT on her DVDs - challenging you to push harder, do a little more than last time - but always encouraging & supportive (NEVER cursing & threatening like on BL)! However, on THIS one she's being SO nice, SO gentle, SO SWEET...her voice goes up high at the end of every sentence and it seriously sounds like she's talking to a child.

Don't get me wrong. I love Jillian and I own almost ALL of her DVDs. It's just weird to hear her being THIS gentle. That said, I assume it's because this workout is truly for beginners and sometimes people need to be coddled a bit at the very beginning; until they start to realize that they're capable of so much more than they ever imagined.",1410912000,20,1042,4.311224489795919

6445821,5,B00KT5PAWE,"A Kinder and Gentler Jillian, it sure seems like it.  Jillian's coaching style is a 180 degrees from her normal drill instructor routine.  Maybe motherhood has mellowed her out or maybe she is tempering her personality to suit the fact she is promoting a beginner style routine.  Both workouts 1 and 2 are exclusively strength.  The third workout has cardio mixed in with strength.  She explains in detail each exercise so that a beginner can benefit by knowing why they are doing the routine.  I am an intermediate-advanced exerciser.  I am not into hard core kill myself workouts any more.  I used to workout till I threw up and that was before I bought a HRM many years ago.  Now I haven't done the actual routine but previewed the video to see what Jillian offered in a beginner's workout. She does mention that this workout can be used for beginners, someone who has been away from working out for awhile, and last but not least new moms. Now this workout can be as hard as you make it.  Increase the intensity on levels 1 and 2 by using heavier weights or following Jillian's advice of trying some of her advanced demonstrations (often done by Anita and sometimes Jillian) - The set itself is nice clean and uncluttered. Jillian brought back Natalie and Anita for this exercise dvd.  Jillian's running commentary is encouraging and her detailed instruction makes the workout definitely doable for a serious beginner.",1410480000,22,1422,4.763265306122449
6445822,4,B00KT5PAWE,"Let me just say that I am a huge Jillian Michaels fan. I use 30 day shred, ripped in 30, and blast fat boost metabolism regularly. She is the only trainer that can actually get my heart rate up high enough to see effective results. BTW, I'm not overweight or really trying to lose weight, I just use these as a maintenance tool...and they are awesome. I like to pick and choose from the 30 day series and intermingle those 3-4 days a week.

Anyway, although it said Beginner Shred, I thought that at least week 3 would be enough for me to have a mid-low range workout. Truth be told, I was not even sweating when it was finished and ended up going on the elliptical for 20 minutes after the workout and had to work out my abs some more. I think that the lack of cardio is the main reason for it, my heart rate just would not rise and my muscles did not fatigue at all. Week 3 does have some cardio, the first two weeks do not have any, it is all strength, but it is still not enough to be super effective like with the 3,2,1 system. This DVD does incorporate some of her signature moves like lunges with bicep curls, chest press with leg extension, abs, etc., but the intervals do not run long enough for more advanced people to get a really good workout. One example of a major modification in particular is for the plank rows, the plank is on your knees, and just not as effective.

If I was a beginner though, this would be the DVD I would run to in a heartbeat. It is a great low impact, yet effective for people that may have more weight to lose and are not in it just for their regular workout routine. Jillian isn't as tough on the participant in this one as she seems to be more encouraging for those trying to get in shape for the first time rather than talking about coming to your house and doing a ""quarter test"" on your rear end. Seriously, if you are a beginner, buy this DVD and then progress to her other 30 day workouts when you feel you are ready.

Summary: Great for beginners, would highly recommend to beginners only, but those that are a little bit more comfortable with exercising, I would go with Ripped in 30 or 30 Day Shred. I knocked off one star in my review due to the week 3 not being much more challenging that the first two.",1410480000,16,2256,4.181609195402299
6445823,2,B00KT5PAWE,"This DVD is great for those less than 100 lbs. overweight. One of the first things I noticed while doing the first workout was how out of breath Jillian was, and she wasn't even doing the full workout like the other gals. Imagine a 100+ lb. overweight person doing this... . I knew it would be excruciating the first couple of times but figured it'd be less the more I tried. Well, I tried and tried and tried some more... until I finally hurt myself. It's a shame it didn't work out for me. I will give this another shot once I lose a few pounds.

Another setback I forgot to mention was the lack of cardio. If you're looking to lose 100 lbs. or more, I recommend you start with Jillian's 30 Day Shred and do what you can. I feel that one is much more doable since it includes more cardio and less strength training.

I am sweaty and tired but I did it so yay me.  I can see doing this tomorrow.  It's just enough of a workout to feel accomplished without burnout for me.

By day 5 I could see huge improvements. By day 10 I made it through the entire 20 minutes. I can see a change in my body and feel how I can move better throughout the day. I needed the DVD to be able to see the 2nd and 3rd levels, since with on-demand I'd have to pay for each level and it made more sense just to buy the DVD. I watched the 2nd level yesterday and I feel the exercises are definitely doable. It's a great DVD even for beginners. Just take it slow, do what you can but stick with it each day.

This program is not as intense as the 30 day shred and I find its a great starting point if you are new to or returning after a while to working out.

8661235,5,B00KT5PAWE,"Highly recommend! I lost 20 lbs in 2 months. I feel so much better and lighter! lol...Once daily every day (sometimes I would skip if I had to go somewhere for awhile) but on average I did 5-6 x a week. I am 57 years old and the exercises were hard at the beginning(cuz I did NO exercise before) but as I did the same routine for a few days(3-5), I noticed they became more easier to do. I changed the routine once I didn't feel stressed.
I also took smaller portions at breakfast and lunch, ate more nutritious meals, stayed away from bread, cut out sweet stuff, drank TONS of water and only drank a shake for supper daily (a type of intermittent fasting but I cheated by drinking my Atkins protein shake). After toughing the no eating at night but my shake, my stomach resigned itself and got with the program :)

The change in diet plus exercise helped me reach 20 lbs quickly. My doctor was very happy! Oh...I am 5 feet tall, and I weighed 190 lbs at the start.
Now I fluctuate around 168-170. I assume I'll lose more if I keep it up. :)

Highly recommend!",1526688000,4,1060,4.242574257425742
8661236,5,B00KT5PAWE,"I am a 35 year old mother who has started and stopped exercise routines so many times I've lost count.  Absolutely nothing seemed to stick.  Going to the gym was too time consuming and, to me, too intimidating.  Other exercise videos were either too high impact for my postpartum joints, were ridiculously easy and gave no results, or I found the instructors so annoying I couldn't stand doing the workouts.  Everything changed with this workout program.  I have actually stuck with it for 23 days straight, which is probably a record for me.  I don't dread the workouts because they're sufficiently challenging but don't put so much strain on my joints that I feel like I'm going to get injured.  Honestly, I've come to look forward to my 20 minutes of exercise time each day.

This program consists of three workouts, each a bit more challenging than the last.  Each one starts with a couple minutes of stretching, followed by three ""rotations"" of around four different exercises each.  You complete each ""rotation"" twice before moving on to the next one.  Most of the exercises have both a beginner and an advanced modification, so you can really customize it to your current fitness level.  Each workout ends with a couple minutes of stretching as well.  The only equipment you will need is a set of dumbbells (I used 3 lb. dumbbells this time but will be attempting to use 5 lb. ones next) and an exercise mat if you're going to be exercising on a hard surface.

I find Jillian Michaels to be amazingly encouraging, and she really pushes me to challenge myself.  In 23 days I've lost almost 6 lbs., simply by doing this workout every day, using my fitness tracker to get 10,000 steps each day (even if it meant pacing around my house after the kids went to bed), and using my calorie tracking app to eat a slight calorie deficit (I set it to lose .5 lbs./week).  I haven't felt this good about myself in years.  I feel like I'm getting stronger and healthier each day, and I can't wait to try more Jillian workouts!",1525996800,4,2020,4.597765363128492
