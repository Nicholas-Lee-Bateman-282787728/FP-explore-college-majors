Watching this superb coral DVD is SO amazing - it relaxes you to the point of not thinking about anything else than what you're seeing. The quality of the photography is absolutely excellent - it is a joy to watch and feel any stress that you might have just melt away. That's why I buy these DVDs; Tony Helsloot and his company does a great job as usual - thanks for continuing to make them!",1386288000,,483,4.260869565217392
2827465,5,B000PLY6Q8,This DVD was received in a very timely manner....everything about this product was great and we enjoy the quality of this product on our big screen....very nice!,1379721600,,161,5.0
2827466,5,B000PLY6Q8,"I play this DVD on the screen as a backdrop at the start of each new open water scuba class I teach, and it is a hit!  The videography is outstanding, the music compliments the visual images very nicely, and it is both relaxing and inspiring to watch.  Yes, this is also a great video for anyone who wants to enjoy the marvelous beauty of the underwater world, through a serene experience of integrated sight and sound.  But, I was looking for something to show at the orientation sessions for my scuba classes, to whet the appetitite of the students, soon to be divers.  Several professional scuba training organizations used to produce videos for this purpose, but most of those have evolved to loud, annoyingly glitzy, nerve-rattling, disjointed, commercials, instead of the more 'spiritual' visual experiences that I was looking for.  I first saw this DVD at my dentist's office, and immediately ordered a copy.",1280448000,,915,4.877419354838709
2827467,4,B000PLY6Q8,"I bought this because my TV is gigantic and I really don't like having a giant black rectangle in the middle of my living room...so why not turn it into a giant fish tank?!  At first I was a little disappointed because the first few options were random scenes that fade from one to another rather quickly.  I don't really know how to explain it, but ti was not what I wanted.  I basically wanted someone to go to an awesome aquarium and set up a video camera in front of a beautiful, giant, diverse tank.  After exploring the options I found something along the lines of what I was looking for- the ""aquarium"" tracks and really enjoyed them! There is 2 tanks to chose from, each approx 25 min long with auto-looping, and the fish are vivid and plentiful. My 1-year old and I got entranced by it for a few minutes...not sure how long, a text message snapped us out of it :) When my husband came home from a meeting, he initially made fun of me for the purchase, but after about 20 minutes of having it on in the background, he sat on the couch and instantly got sucked into the serenity of the  fish tank!  I also like the ""across the reef"" track.  The audio options aren't great, waves or piano.  I plan to play the DVD through the XBox, so that we can still use the CD or Radio on our Bose system that usually serves as the DVD player.",1424390400,,1336,4.19140625

2827471,5,B000PLY6Q8,"It has not a4rrived yet and was scheduled for Monday. Where is this.
As for my review I've owned this one for a long time, lost it and this was an attempt to replace the lost one .I love watching all of the beautiful sea creatures along with the very unusual fish that a person might not know exists without seeing it. Tony's photography is as always outstanding.

I give this a 5 rating",1410393600,,387,4.22972972972973
2827472,5,B000PLY6Q8,"I bought this to help my 3 year old son wind down in the evening.  He loves it and often requests to cuddle and watch the ""relaxing fishies movie"".  I like it as well, it's a great, mellow, stress reducing thing to pop in after a long day for me too.  Thumbs up!",1395100800,,262,3.9056603773584904
2827473,5,B000PLY6Q8,I cannot understand the negative comments on this product unless it is from a competitor! If you are looking for something calming and simply beautiful look no further. We use a lot of ambient DVD's and this is one of the best. Love it and recommend it happily!,1394496000,,261,4.458333333333333
2827474,5,B000PLY6Q8,"I bought this dvd for my 92 year old mother who has dementia. It is very calming and seems to help with her ""sundowning"" anxiety. I would advise for anyone who loves aquariums and relaxing music.",1392508800,,195,4.444444444444445
2827475,2,B000PLY6Q8,I was disappointed with it.  It was not an entire DVD of continuous music and calming scenes of tropical fish.  We have since discontinued using it.,1392336000,,148,4.653846153846154
2827476,3,B000PLY6Q8,"I found no directions on how to install aquarium dvd into windows 7. I need instructions or it is worthless.

8192862,5,B000PLY6Q8,My 2 year old is deaf and panics at night if the lights are turned out. We found that a nightlight was too distracting for him. We used to put on curious george and mute the sound but he was so happy to watch george he would bounc up and down for and hours on his bed laughing not going to sleep until sometimes after midnight. We knew we needed soemthing more soothing to get him to lay down and sleep. FIRST NIGHT... we received the DVD. we put it on and he was asleep in 15 minutes. and slept all nignt! SUCCESS!!!!,1428796800,,518,4.038834951456311
