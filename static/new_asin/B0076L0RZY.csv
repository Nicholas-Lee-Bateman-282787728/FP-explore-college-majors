5057510,5,B0076L0RZY,"i also was in a christian church that was extreme and legalistic w/ much false indoctrination. It has been over 30 years and I am still being deprogrammed. God is still breaking me free from mindsets that went in deep! It has been quite a journey but I am slowly but surely getting rooted in the real gospel and the grace of God in Christ. This sort of false teaching , brainwashing, church abuse is still around in many forms. A great, very enjoyable movie. Quality!",1336953600,6,467,4.441860465116279
5057511,4,B0076L0RZY,"I knew the screenwriter, Andie Redwine, when she was in high school, so this may seem to be a rather biased review, but it isn't.  I loved the movie.  It is darling, witty, endearing, funny, quirky, and all the other things that I love to see in a film.

It may make you question why you believe what you do, or why you attend church where you do.  That's actually a good thing.  If you don't know why you do what you do, why are you doing it?

I loved Esther, in all her naivete, and Gabriel's character came across as a truly good person, whether he believes in God or not.

For a first time film, shot on a shoestring budget, in less than a month, this movie is wonderful.  I can't wait to see what this team of people comes up with next.",1336867200,6,741,4.062068965517241
5057512,5,B0076L0RZY,"I have always loved you.

  What an appropiate song for the ending of that movie it left a single tear in my eye after being out of a Cult nearly 30 years.  The movie took me too and ebb and flow almost wave like thru uncetainty of Esther just walking out the door of a building and looking around,as in defending herself  and how I felt also after not having watched tv for  4 years and listened to music NOT by and about Cult teachings. ,the movie also stir that swell of how I felt when just thinking about the people I knew in the Cult,the people I don't know and never will know and how I long for them to be free and know the FREEDOM in the Truth of what Jesus really wanted for Us all.

I remembered how alone I felt.  How the World looked to me before and after and how it looks NOW after Recovery.

To be able to question and think and not be afraid of ""the world"" but love LIFE .  I felt soooooooo  unworthy after leaving the Cult ,Judas like and no one understood
and much support was needed.  This is a great Film and it is Healing.

and it is true..........I have always loved Jesus...I just took a distored road for a while.and it is good to be on the Open Highway of Freedom.  That is how the Film made me remember how,where and why of the twist and turns of my personal life journey.

Powerful stuff Andie.",1335484800,6,1322,4.089494163424124
5057513,5,B0076L0RZY,"I saw the film at the Indianapolis Heartland Film Festival.  As a survivor of a christianized cult, I found myself riding an emotional rollercoaster through this film.  Watching Esther go through a confident blind acceptance that they way she had been taught was the only right way, through the betrayal that she experienced and finally coming to a place where she understood that her faith to be her own personal journey, not one designed by a self serving huckster was absolutely fantastic.

It's very difficult to portray this type of transition in the short time of a film, but these film makers have managed to do a bang up job.  The actors all handled their roles with beautiful expressiveness.

It may be a little challenging for some who feel that negative humor (mild though it is in this film) about religion is off limits.  But it is just another way of dealing with the ugly side of cults that keeps things from becoming too heavy handed and preachy.  If you find yourself in this category, stick to it, because Esther's choice in the end makes it worthwhile.

No single voice will be able to be the complete answer to the issue of religious abuse, but the one brought to the table by this film is definitely one of the ones to listen to.",1332374400,12,1250,4.573991031390134
5057514,5,B0076L0RZY,"Paradise Recovered is a great independent film! I loved it when I've seen it in several different film festivals. It's beautifully written, beautifully filmed and all in all, is a great watch.

So many films that deal with religious content are preachy or frankly, poorly made. Paradise Recovered is neither. I highly recommend it for the whole family!",1329436800,6,352,5.068965517241379
5057515,5,B0076L0RZY,"This independent film represents a call to awareness of the religious abuse that has become such a common scene on the American religious right landscape.  The film is an exercise in contrasts - contrasts that Esther must experience in order to recover paradise for herself.  Two young men, Gabriel and Philip, are presented to Esther as choices for love.  Philip, the malingering convert, appears to understand the problems with his church, but is willing to play the game for his gain - sexual and financial.  Gabe stands as an agnostic, who really seems to believe in God, who proclaims his disdain for the trappings of organized religion, but who stands upon his beliefs, ambiguous as they are even to him.  But then there are two fathers.  Both just as firm in their belief in organized religion, both are pastors.  Philip's father uses his position to control others.  He does not care for the souls, only for his own power.  Gabe's father gets it.  He believes in God and organized religion.  He stands firm in his own faith and will not apologize for that faith.  But - and this is important - his confidence is so strong that he has no need to coerce, force, abuse others into the fold.  Gabe's father understands the freedom that Christ affords.  His is no legalistic faith and he can be proud of his son for being an agnostic, but living the love of Christ in a real sense.

This film is poignant because it brings into focus the problem of the social gospel.  The extreme religious right condemns the many churches for their focuses on doing unto others as we would have others do unto us, calling those of us who believe living Christ's love ""the failure of the social gospel.""  Yet it is the religious right who truly preach the social gospel - that is, they preach America's salvation is in transforming American culture through laws and coercion. This film reminds us that we can be free through Christ.  Though you may watch it and believe it to be an attack on Christianity, it is not.  It is an attack on those who would use Christianity to control others, to exert abuse and call it faith.  It is an attack on those who would use God and the Bible to abuse others.",1329350400,25,2184,4.565552699228792

5057517,5,B0076L0RZY,"Winner of the Dead Center Film Festival, Paradise Recovered is one of the best indie films I've seen. (actually....better than most major studio films I've seen lately) It is the story of a young woman caught up in a Christian cult who discovers what she believes and is taught by the cult, is not what the leadership of the cult lives out.  In a delightfully light, humorous manner the movie presents the recapture of her own freedom and grace while she forms a relationship with a young man questioning his own spiritual beliefs and heritage.  Wonderfully acted and amazingly well directed Paradise Recovered should have been the indie film of the year.",1329177600,11,655,4.839285714285714
5057518,4,B0076L0RZY,"To be upfront, I know the filmmakers of ""Paradise Recovered"" ... I stand by my review, however and would not be writing this unless I firmly believed what I am about to write: ""Paradise"" is a beautifully done movie about a young woman's spiritual journey and maturation. If you are like me, that description initially might be squirm inducing. However, the movie is also a warm and tender romance and is often quite funny. This is not your typical indie drama. It is at times a surprising story about spirituality and grace, particularly given the hero of the movie is an atheist who comes to the aid of a Christian going through a crisis of faith. The acting by the two leads is splendid, they are a pleasure to watch, as are many of the supporting performances. The direction is sensitive and spot on. 'Paradise' is a lovely, entertaining movie with some complex ideas thoughtfully and honestly addressed. This is well worth your time.",1329177600,18,937,4.719512195121951

5057521,5,B0076L0RZY,"IMHO, a well acted, engaging, sensitive portrayal of a sincere young woman making the journey from cult to grace under the guidance of a free-thinking agnostic. Though the cult is portrayed more harshly than a typical member may experience it, and the ""case for grace"" is rather sketchy, the young woman's struggle between the strict religion she grew up with and the ""anything goes"" attitude of secular society is one that should be familiar to anyone who has tried to reconcile their religion with the ""rationalism"" of the modern world.
It's refreshing to see a movie that treats both religious and non-religious searchings with realism and sympathy,
suggesting that perhaps there is a middle way between dogma and secular reason to be found in simply loving one another.",1414713600,2,773,5.046875

5057524,2,B0076L0RZY,"Let me start by saying this is not a ""Christian"" or Faith-based film.  When one watches an independent film that is listed under ""spiritual"" one generally expects to view, well, a Christian film; this is not.

While the premise of the movie relates a poignant topic of an aspect of ""religion"" that could well be studied and developed, the movement within the film does not flow to the effect of believability nor does it even provide an education for the viewer in the matter.  We are left with nothing more than an expression of free-thinking that could have been better shared in a ten minute oration than through the length of this film.

In the film, we see a girl, Esther, who is being manipulated by a pastor - and I use that term loosely - and supposedly by a cult-like church, though we do not see other members of the church interacting with any of the main characters other than sitting in a pew.  The actors portraying the ""cult"" members appear really awkward - not the intended behavior in portrayal, but reflected of the actors attempt at that portrayal.  The wife of the cult pastor seems to be more of a manipulator than her husband.  We get mixed feelings about their son - We are left to even wonder what his own mother thinks about him.  She questions why he is coming home for a visit.  Awkward.  But later, when it's convenient for her, she sides with her son and seems to care about his heart.  We don't really get to know enough information about the deeper motivations of the son's character to know what he's really thinking. Is he a nice guy and just misled?  Does he know his dad is the pastor of cult?  Is he seeking something different?  Why is he going to become a pastor himself?  (Spoiler) Esther has been chosen  by the cult parents to be his wife.  We know he thinks she is acceptable (or does he) as his intended when he tries to rape her!  Because Esther has been supposedly taught to just obey whatever she is told, she barely resists.  Of course, in his arrogance (or is it his lack of understanding of reality - we don't know) and in his own mind, it surely is viewed as rape.  His action is only stopped by his father, who has come in to ""check"" on Esther (and what was up with that.)  We find out that Esther was homeschooled; since she is represented throughout as one who is uneducated, gullible, nave, and lost, the viewer is then left to relate that all homeschoolers must be the same.  Her father isn't in the picture and her mother is said to be an alcoholic; so we aren't even sure who exactly did the teaching in that homeschool - or if there was any at all.

(This is a very narrow-minded portrayal of the homeschool community.  [...]  While there may be cults that homeschool for the purpose of keeping the children of their congregation in the dark to truth, throwing in that Esther was homeschooled within the context of this undeveloped plot line is simply an expression of bias and not one of character development. )

The film uses foul language, alcohol, partying, the idea of drugs, a pool hall, skinny dipping, etc. to portray what the rest of the world that is not walking toward faith or belief participates regularly.  The viewer isn't shown that this nature is sinful; rather that all of it means that a person is free-thinking and looking for something, but we never really find out what.  Two young men, Gabriel and his roommate, take Esther under their ""wings"" and help lead her away from the cult and her ""faith"" in what she has been taught toward a somewhat vague understanding of freedom with hopes of teaching her to think for herself.  We see Gabriel's dad, a pastor of what we are to simply to accept by ""faith"" is a ""real church,"" expressing a proud moment and love toward a son (Gabriel) who has been estranged from his family because of his lack of belief in their faith. Suddenly, no longer estranged, Gabriel is graduating and the whole family and friends are a part of the festivities. The spark of connection, however, is short lived.  Gabriel doesn't choose to believe in salvation through Christ and is shown to simply be keeping an open mind to God, while Esther, on the other hand, having forsaken the law that condemned her and having discovered freedom in Christ, chooses a spur of the moment baptism by Gabriel's father in a fountain.  We are to infer that she has found a better belief in what it means to ""really"" be a Christian.  Now that she is a ""real"" believer, she is open to a relationship with the ""savior-like"" Gabriel who is himself still an unbeliever.  Forget about that notion of being equally yoked!  Most of the world's real Christian churches have, so why not!

While the bare bones of this film have great potential, it lacks the substance to carry it into glory!  Instead of Paradise Recovered, we have ""maybe"" a wonder of if there is a paradise at all.  Undeveloped, slow-moving, unimaginative.",1392336000,11,4899,4.532423208191126
5057525,5,B0076L0RZY,"I identified with this movie, completely, having grown up in a Fundamental Christian sect.  I was touched by the lead character, Esther.

5057527,5,B0076L0RZY,"Great movie! Acting was awesome for the most part. A good change from the average christian movie. The perfect description I believe for this movie is....Modern day take on the bibles jewish pharisees and priests. They tried to live to God's laws perfectly and taught so, only to be corrupt themselves. They did not LOVE. They were blind. It is impossible for our sinful nature to be perfect. Only a perfect God could save us and forgive us. In came Jesus.",1372464000,2,456,4.6419753086419755
5057528,5,B0076L0RZY,"Paradise Recovered is inspired by the story of the Good Samaritan, although after seeing this movie I think it more often than not  resembles the prodigal son.  It concerns Esther, appropriately named for the beauty queen in the biblical story who saved her people by sleeping with the king. Sorry folks, but I don't buy that Esther stopped the king from destroying her people by staying up all night and talking him to death.

Esther apparently comes from a branch of the Apostolic faith that does not celebrate birthdays, holidays, forces her to wear long dresses, yet doesn't seem to have a problem sipping wine in a public restaurant.  This particular fellowship meets in a bingo hall where they watch videotapes coming from church headquarters.  Esther has been `promised' to marry Phillip Sawyer, the son of the pastor, David Sawyer.  One night, Phillip decides to sneak into her bedroom.  Pastor Sawyer catches them making out and immediately tosses the girl out on the streets.

Esther finds work at a health food store where she is taken in by Gabriel, the manager,  who just happens to be the son of an evangelical minister.  His roommate is a devout skeptic and together they coax Esther out of her shell.  They have a tattooed woman give Esther (a redhead, btw) a new hairdo and make her ditch the Little House on the Prairie dresses for tight blue jeans. They entice her to eat food forbidden by her church.  In the most tasteful skinny dipping scene ever filmed, the boys turn their heads so she can get naked and get in the water.  They  follow suit although it looks like no one ever saw anyone naked in the first place.

The tables get turned on Gabriel when he throws her a surprise birthday party.  It triggers something inside her.  She gets drunk and then eventually questions Gabriel's motives in trying to de-convert her.  Like most fundamentalist expatriates, she experiences the yo-yo effect and returns to her world.  Gabriel tries to win her back and, with the help of his evangelical father, shows her how she can `love God and still be free'.

The difficulty in crafting such a story depends on how fearless the writer will be in pursuing the obvious implications.  What if Esther decided to reject both the religion of  Gabriel and her new inlaws and find enlightenment in Eastern religions? What if she became a Hindu, or a Wiccan, Unitarian or even embrace Atheism?  What if Esther decided to simply sleep in on Sundays? Sometimes the most radical thing a survivor of an extreme fundamentalist sect can do is simply lead a normal life.

On a personal note: I noticed one of the advisors of this movie is Janja Lalich, who was a speaker at the Survivors of Institutional Abuse convention of 2012.  She has written extensively about cults but nearly ruffled my feathers (and those of a few at the convention) when she accidently used a `trigger phrase'.  Someone asked how to deal with people who make light of the abuse experienced at group homes.  The response was simply not to talk to those people which, in the ears of some, sounded like another version of  'get over it'.  Since that time, survivors have engaged in dialogue with her regarding this but for some  it still rubs the wrong way.

My experience with cult experts is they fall into the temptation to separate `cults' from the legitimate religions.

What happens when the so-called legitimate groups begin covering up scandal?  The Southern Baptist Convention has reacted deplorably to victims of child abuse within their ranks, yet no one refers to them as a cult.  The same can be said for the Presbyterian Church (USA) as well as just about any other major religious organization.

Paradise Recovered is definitely a movie I would recommend since there are few movies dealing with the cultic aspects of fundamentalist religions. I would have enjoyed seeing more of Esther's background.  What was her upbringing like?  I'm assuming she was raised in this denomination but was it out of choice?  Did she grow up in it?  What were her parents like?

There should be more movies like this showing other paths of recovery and fulfillment.  I plan to watch Paradise Recovered again and maybe I'll feel different after giving it a chance to grow on me. The fact that it prompted this reaction shows it is worthy of an hour and a half of your time.  It is good that there is a movie dealing with spiritual abuse that is palatable to the evangelical subculture.  I would just like to see more variety for those of us with different viewpoints.",1369526400,,4533,4.735632183908046
5057529,5,B0076L0RZY,"Paradise Recovered is an independent film that follows a fundamentalist believer's journey to freedom. The Parable of the Good Samaritan is at the heart of story, though here it is a church that has robbed our victim and left her for dead through spiritual abuse. The film so deeply resonates with me and reminds me of the blind faith I once held for Teen Mania and the legalism involved both with the internship and my time as a Messianic Jew.

I spent a decade--practically all of my twenties--in confusion and terror of losing my salvation, like an ocean wave constantly crashing back and forth from The World on one side and The Law on the other. That sort of tempestuousness left me with a battered soul. Paradise Recovered ably captures that internal storm, and I admit it reminds me that my healing is still not complete.

Much like the film's protagonist, Esther, I am challenging my former prohibitions. Yes, I test the waters and engage in things I used to believe (or have been told) are wrong. Not to be rebellious or get away with as much as possible, but to work out the meaning of my faith. I do things now to better understand what my faith looks like in action, and more fully explore Love to enjoy my freedom.

My freedom. Currently, freedom for me includes: using profanity and saying OMG. Drinking alcohol. Practicing yoga. Learning about Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda. Getting acupuncture. Studying open theism. Attending the church of a previously blacklisted pastor. Allowing myself to hear and make sexual jokes. Reading books with liberal views on sex and the Bible. Dating people who would have been off-limits in the past. I frequently wear ""low-cut"" shirts and allow myself to wear my purse crossed over my chest (TM girls, you KNOW what I mean!)

Perhaps I'll take a cue from Esther's story and go skinny-dipping soon. I don't know--the point is that my future is open. I'm no longer willing to let other people tell me what to think and how to live. My faith is strong enough to stand up to questions and my own search for freedom. Again, Love is louder.

What strikes me most about Paradise Recovered is the way in which a non-believer helps guide a Christian into freedom. I'm actually kind of jealous of these fictional characters. I think about how amazing it would have been to have not been alone for so long with my own recovery. To have had a friend who would help guide me to live so freely. I then consider the parable of The Good Samaritan and I ponder the roles that I have played, as well as my future part.

Who do we want to be in the story? I'm not talking labels of religious beliefs. I'm talking about action and Love. Each person who has suffered abuse under the guise of godliness--well, at some point all are battered and left for dead on the road. All need healing and freedom, just like TM survivors. Will you stop for them? Will you inconvenience yourself to help set another person free?

Many offer help to the wounded, but do so with an agenda. They may seek to win a soul for the kingdom. They may confront a person with guilt or obligation and coercion. They may point out sin and faults, calling it love. Yet God's Love, pure Love is all about freedom. Free will. Free choice. Non-violence. Real Love allows for questions, discussion and doubt. True Love does not seek to connive or convince and obtain a certain result beyond the act of loving.

Paradise Recovered demonstrates God's Love as something not limited to those who call themselves Christian. Love is not owned by those who uphold the supposed Christian standard. The Honor Academy leadership is not full of experts in the art of loving. For cult survivors, that is a huge realization. Being able to see goodness and Love in the secular world is a significant step to freedom.

My hope is that it is a part of your freedom as well.",1362441600,2,3865,4.6061046511627906

8510944,5,B0076L0RZY,"For me, this movie was personal. I was raised in a cult of alleged Christianity that completely overlooked Jesus. It was all about following rules, obeying, trusting, never questioning authority. I saw myself in the character of Esther. I felt her pain, her questions, her doubts, and her triumph echoing through my own experience. Phenomenally moving film that I would give ten thumbs up if I had them.

For those who have never been involved in a cult, you may be skeptical of the character of Esther. Don't be. People in cults really do get brainwashed to that extent. Cults have perfected mind control techniques and infused them with religious fervor. This story may be fictional, but it is very, very real. I noticed Steven Hassan in the credits as a consultant. He is one of the world's foremost authorities on cults, himself having survived the Moonies. The writing for this movie has been very well researched and accurately portrays life in a cult.

Enjoy the movie for its storytelling. The education is on the house.",1489536000,,1028,4.8352272727272725
8510945,4,B0076L0RZY,"I liked the film very much.  A realistic problem in our society today where many 'cults' pass themselves off as Christian churches.  The characters of Esther and Gabriel were especially likeable and realistic.  One drawback though is that Mr. Vanderbilt's 'church' was never clearly identified as a cult in the film, and it therefore could unintentionally strengthen this false stereotype of what Christianity is that unfortunately many people hold.  Gabriel's father does seem to be a true Christian at the end of the film, standing for grace and forgiveness as opposed to the legalism of Mr. Vanderbilt and his cult.",1489017600,,618,5.15

8510947,3,B0076L0RZY,not solid enough on the straight answer although  I  liked a lot of what they said about  the false gospel controlling the people . They  had to answer to people instead of a loving God.,1483401600,,186,4.228571428571429
8510948,5,B0076L0RZY,"Paradise Recovered, though fictionalized, provides an extremely accurate and horrifying view of what the reality is like to live in a religious cult, leave, and start a new life beyond the confines of what is known as the only ""truth,"" and ""god's way."" As a survivor of a religious cult, I could deeply identify with many of Esther's experiences. The turmoil she dealt with while inside the cult and the difficult effort to establish a new life and identity were all quite familiar. There were moments in the movie when I felt an incredible sense of deja vu as if my life was playing out in front of me. This is an excellent movie for those who wish to know more about authoritarian environments, and for cult survivors, who will find quite a bit with which they can identify.",1477872000,,776,4.589928057553957
8510949,5,B0076L0RZY,"I love this movie and have recommended it to so many people. The characters are multi-dimensional, the dialogue feels fresh and genuine, and it is wonderful to have a movie in which religion is treated thoughtfully and seriously.",1477612800,,229,5.052631578947368
8510950,5,B0076L0RZY,"This is an excellent movie and commentary on religion today. It tells the story of a young female who has been raised in a cult-like religion. Her marriage has already been arranged. Then her world unravels. She takes a job at a store and is exposed to ideas and ways that would shock her family.

Heather Wallis turns in a masterful performance as Esther. It is very easy to feel what she is feeling, as her heart and soul are torn by family, friends, and different concepts of spirituality.

The movie doesn't trivialize the feelings and issues. It shows what is right and what is wrong with religion in a loving and sympathetic manner. Regardless of your faith, I highly recommend this movie to anyone.",1456963200,2,705,4.632
8510951,3,B0076L0RZY,"I am a church going, Bible believing Christian that yes home schooled my children even.  In my experience I have meet some very well meaning people who want the best for their children. It is the freedom of the parent to choose what they feel is best. I also have meet some that yes were to legalistic and more into the rules than the relationship with Jesus.  It is through the love of God that I desire to please him.  Am I perfect, no, don't claim to be however that is why I need my Savior.  I need him to pay for my sins and take my punishment and as I spend time with him changed into a better person because I love him and want to please him.  Esther and her group had it backwards, follow the rules and become righteous. As we saw it end up being a pretend game and outward righteousness with no inward real desire.
  I am however concerned about groups like Esther's.  There is basic Bible truths that are accepted by many Christians. Like Jesus is God not just a good teacher, not just his son.  The other issues of what Bible translation, ways to worship, we see as a followers preference, views or how God is directing them. The spiritually abusive groups are wrong.  My pastor teaches what he believes is truth but doesn't watch me and judge when I am not doing it perfectly. He knows I am not going to be perfect, I am human and always in need of my Savior.  He gently encourages us, and takes questions after the sermon.
  At first I was feeling offended with the movie because on a whole people judge me for being to ""conservative"".  I don't dress or do... because I have to I do what I do because I like dresses with flowers on them.  I do what I feel my conscious is saying.  We have to allow all people to choose even if it maybe challenges you.  I don't make my choices to put other down or even challenge others.
  I did see that the sect was being abusive, legalistic, not even following the Bible. Heaven and Hell are named in the Bible, not lake of fire or paradise. I have a brother that believes that Jesus is just God's son who became a God and he too will when he dies. I still talk with him and treat him w/ respect and love.  I recently have a sister who yes had a rocky marriage, is divorcing her husband because he will not continue to follow her pastor.  This pastor believes he has all truth, that if you are sick a curse is on you (brother in law is having concussion forgetfulness), you must learn Greek to really understand the Bible,  is putting pressure on her to divorce him quickly,  she spend a lot of personal time with him that is not professional.  I really do want the best for both my siblings and this movie really hit a cord with me.  I did contact a group that talked about mind control and the special features does talk about this.  Mind control, manipulative abuse behavior is not Christianity.  Christ offers himself to you and never forces himself on you.  If a Christian wants to talk about their faith listen as you would anything else that is important to them.  Have a respectful conversation.
One reviewer lumped all the Mind control groups together with all Christians. Right wing  Conservative, Fundamentalist.  Just because you do not believe does not make it mind control.  Also being a good citizen I have a duty to vote as my conscience tells me just as you do.  In America we are given freedom of religion which gives the right do chose my religion and live it out in my everyday life, not freedom of worship that tells me I can worship in the church but when I come out I better leave my conscience there.
Overall I feel everyone would benefit knowing how to think for themselves and not be controlled or abused.  If this movie is a first step to freedom and a true relationship with Jesus then great.  If it just gives you a bad taste in your mouth for all Christians then I pray you will run into a God loving Christian so you will see the true thing.",1450310400,,3921,4.2884353741496595
8510952,5,B0076L0RZY,"It was a very good movie, well presented and tastefully done. For myself personally I could relate to a lot of the story line.",1433721600,,126,4.291666666666667
