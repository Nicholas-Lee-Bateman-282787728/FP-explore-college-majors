4582864,3,B00561BNJK,"""There comes a moment when you look around waiting for the person in charge to help you and then you realize your the person in charge."" After her father suffers a breakdown, Mona (Alba) becomes obsessed with math. Using it has an escape she becomes distant from reality until her mother kicks her out. After taking a job teaching math to elementary school kids she learns to grow up and help others. This movie started off very funny and entertaining then really started to drag. The ending was OK, very predictable though. The middle of the movie seemed to repeat itself and drag on and on and on. For those who like off beat quirky humor this is a movie for you. I would compare the humor to ""500 Days Of Summer"", but not as funny. This did have some very touching moments in it, but overall this movie had the potential to be very good, but it never got what it needed. Overall, a good movie that could have been better. It was just missing something. I give it a C+.

Would I watch again? - I don't think I will.

*Also try - 500 Days Of Summer & Music Never Stopped",1316995200,5,1071,4.270935960591133
4582865,5,B00561BNJK,"This is romantic comedy for all ages. An off-beat 'coming of age' story about a young mathematically-gifted girl who uses numbers to hide from grown-up realities. Her beloved, mathematician, dad's break-down and increasing detachment from reality causes her to irrationally forsake all pleasures except math. When she is pushed (by Mom) into the adult role of math teacher at an elementary school, she realizes that she must become the grown-up authority for her students. Gradually, she recognizes that her infantile, self-destructive impulses can be controlled. She is urgently needed by Lisa, her young student who is soon to be orphaned. Mona's grown-up epiphany is ""There comes a moment when you look around waiting for the person in charge to help you. Then you realize you're the only adult in the room. You ARE the person in charge, and you're not very good at it."" But Mona accepts her teacher's role & most of the the kids trust her. Mona recognizes that she cannot 'keep her father company' as he becomes increasingly obsessive & delusional. In her own words, she 'no longer needs a bathroom monitor' and takes the risk of an intimate relationship again, this time with Ben Smith as an adult, not an adoring daughter.

The charm of this story is that all the main characters, both adults & children, have odd little habits but are likeable folks. Each is coping with personal or family tragedies -- yet there is very little violence, instead, several become neurotic, eccentric loners as a result. Jessica Alba , Chris Messina, & J K Simmons do solid jobs in creating the off-beat personalities in the film. If you like eccentric but kind-hearted schoolteachers, you're probably enjoy 'An Invisible Sign'.",1316822400,26,1716,5.0

4582915,4,B00561BNJK,"The story is sweet, the characters are all interesting. The only negative, is you will have to suspend you belief a little. For instance, The main character, Mona gets a teaching job with no college degree, no training and no experience other than someone noticed she was good at math as a child. That's pretty ridiculous. But as far as dramatic entertainment goes, I think this delivers.

Her classroom management is terrible.  She connects with a troubled girl in the third grade.  She eventually loses her job because she does things no certified teacher would ever do.

4582954,4,B00561BNJK,"This was the story of a mean, dishonest little obsessive compulsive girl trying to make her way through the world behaving like a mean little girl and failing miserably in life. She thought everybody believed she was a sweet innocent little girl which is the front she tried to put out there.
I thought it was such a good example of mean little girls who think they are getting away with the ruse but not, that I sent a copy of the movie as a gift to the daughters of each of my acquaintances who are just like her, which is I behaving the same way they do to get my message across. Their daughters are not that way but they will see their mothers in these characters. Sometimes you have to speak the same language to communicate well.
Let's see how perceptive the mothers are. Both will catch on very quickly in my opinion. I hope it leads to some insight. If it does I will be able to tell by their reaction, anger. I rebalanced my anger meter. Can hardly wait to see the result. The added benefit is to the children.",1378339200,,1019,4.257731958762887

Jessica Alba and J.K. Simmons both surprised me with the quality of their performances. Alba portrays her character perfectly as a painfully awkward girl stuck in a life she hardly understands, and watching her, you almost feel as embarrassed and uncomfortable as her, she plays it so well.

The story and narration are both fantastic. Easily one of my top 10 favorite movies.",1376956800,,533,4.720430107526882

4582958,3,B00561BNJK,"This was an ALMOST perfect indie film -- an original tale about quirky, marginalized characters. But it's ruined when, during the film's last five minutes, an artificially sappy, happy Hollywood ending is tacked on.

Mona (Jessica Alba) is an emotionally troubled young woman. Her father appears to be schizophrenic. It's likely that Mona has inherited his mental disease (whatever that is) and will worsen with time.

Mona gets a job teaching math, though her mother lied about Mona having a college degree. Then a science teacher courts Mona, but she can't connect with him (or anyone). After he kisses her, she runs away and eats soap. She drives him away. Mona also brings an ax into class, because it's shaped like the number 7.

SPOILERS ...

Near the film's end, there's a classroom fight. Two of Mona's (also emotionally troubled) girl students fight over the ax (while the boys fight over a prosthetic limb). One of the girls just lost her mother to cancer. The other girl's parents are going through a messy divorce. In the aftermath, one girl's forehead is bloodied against a glass pane. The other girl (carrying the ax) slips on urine, with the ax embedding itself into Mona's leg.

Mona is fired by the school.

Up until now, the film was filled with moments of poignancy and honest emotion -- but then in the FINAL 5 MINUTES -- after Mona's firing -- everything turns around for her with sudden ease.

* Mona is suddenly able to love the science teacher.

* Mona adopts the student who lost her mother to cancer.

* Mona's attorney threatens to sue the school, resulting in Mona getting her teaching job back.

This fake, SAPPY Hollywood ending ruins an otherwise courageous indie film.

The lawsuit is especially FAKE. Mona's attorney says that Mona has an excellent case against the school (for wrongful termination, one presumes).

ON WHAT PLANET?

* Mona has NO college degree. Her mother LIED to the school district about her qualifications, and Mona supported that lie. She is legally unqualified to teach. It wouldn't matter if she now promises to go to night school to get her degree, they can still fire her.

* One student was INJURED under Mona's supervision -- and others were endangered all because Mona brought an AX to class! Mona is lucky she isn't sued by the student's guardian. The guardian certainly has an excellent lawsuit against the school district.

* On top of which, Mona is still in her first year of teaching. She'd be under probation, without tenure. It'd be EASY to fire her, for a lot less.

The filmmakers should have kept the film real, honest, and authentic. Mona should not have had such an artificially happy turnaround on all fronts -- gets the guy, adopts the kid, gets her job back despite having NO case whatsoever against the school district.

I loved this film until the last 5 minutes, but the dishonest ending left a bad taste in my mouth.",1360800000,8,2898,4.75249500998004
4582959,5,B00561BNJK,"This movie is kind of a rare bird. It seems a little bizzare, especially the ending, yet I loved it. Its about a girl who is to herself, quirky, and very creative. She sees things in different ways which inspire creativity. I really just want to write about what I liked. I loved the way she spent hours fixing her room and the bulletin boards, how she could see the way parts could fit together. I related to her world inside. She had a hard time connecting with others but it was shown in a way to make her special and unique. Her way of having children use their bodies to understand shapes, the way she thought of things rather than looking at lessons written in a book, done repitively throughout years of teaching. She wasn't your normal teacher and the staff was fun too. They weren't distant towards her uniqueness and they were unique too. They had personalities that made them different, not the bonding and belonging that sometimes happens, sometimes from burnout and forgetting your creativity. I just liked her freedom to be herself in all places, she didn't act like something she wasn't. There were colors and materials, books, things that felt safe and fun.",1347321600,4,1173,4.644230769230769
4582993,5,B00561BNJK,"I read the book some years before I got around to seeing the movie.  Some parts of the book were left out of the movie, but it was still very nice.

4582994,1,B00561BNJK,"After watching the trailer for An Invisible Sign, I thought that it was going to be a romantic comedy-ish movie.  To my surprise, the movie is actually about mental illness and an unhealthy relationship.

I can't say if I would have thought the movie was better if I would've known that going in, but I doubt it since I consider it one of the worst movies I've ever had to pay for.

So if you were expecting a cute, romantic story like myself, Stay Away from this movie!",1329436800,11,470,4.318181818181818
4582995,5,B00561BNJK,"I loved this movie.  Understated and quirky.  They could have gone off the rails with the math thing.  I'm glad Alba's character wasn't a plythera of psychological disorders, she simply shut herself off from the world, one small joy after another.  The journey back to herself was an entertaining ride.  I'll watch it again.",1327881600,3,324,4.925925925925926
4582996,5,B00561BNJK,Jessica Alba  is great in this movie. I am a big fan of Jessica Alba. This movie show a difference side of Jessica. If you are a fan of JA you will love this movie.,1325116800,3,164,3.6857142857142855
4582997,4,B00561BNJK,"An Invisible Sign isn't *anything* like what I was expecting.  It's honestly only *partially* a love story, though the brief moments where Jessica Alba's character gets romantic with her boyfriend are definitely the least appealing aspects of the film, hence the reason I took exactly 1 point off the ratings scale.

Anyway the storyline is about Jessica Alba getting the opportunity to be a teacher (thanks to her rude and uncaring mother) to a bunch of kids who have a serious problem sitting still and behaving.  Yeah, like ALL kids!  What's interesting is that she already *knew* she wasn't cut out for the job which is why she initially didn't want to accept it, so it doesn't exactly come as a shock when she discovers the kids are hard to tolerate and keep under control.

Well, that's how the storyline *starts*.  From there it just turns into a weird mess.  Let's see.  She's obsessed with numbers, and the movie writers tried to wrap a storyline around her fascination with numbers (including her neighbor who's an old man that taught her this particular obsession) but... there's more to it than that.  At least I think so.  The entire numbers concept seemed boring to me and unnecessary anyway.

She develops a special friendship with one of her students because the little girls mom is dying of... eye cancer.  Yeah, seriously.  Of course you can probably guess what's going to happen at the end of the movie because the build-up is nothing particularly *different* concerning the tired and old ""parent dies, what happens to child?"" storylines.  You've seen this same set up a thousand times in other movies, and it isn't executed any differently here.  Still, just in case it's not obvious enough, I won't come right out and SAY what happens.

The best part for me is around 70 minutes in, when *something* happens in the classroom.  This is actually a REALLY shocking series of unfortunate events that takes place, and it happens suddenly so do NOT miss this segment!  I was almost certain that what takes place was even WORSE thanks to the slow motion effect, until we discover what really happens.  Yikes!

Anyway yeah, besides falling in love with a guy who works at the school (well, reluctantly falls in love with- you'll see what I mean) I really like how shy and timid Jessica Alba's character is.  It's VERY different from the kind of open and boisterous things we've seen her star in before.  I liked it.

The one aspect of An Invisible Sign that seems hard to really understand is Jessica's father who had something happen to him and he never recovered, so he spends his days with his head in the clouds so to speak.  His lost his mind somewhere along the line.  Never really understood what happened to him, even though it tried to be explained in the beginning.  Strange.

Overall, no, this isn't a romantic comedy at all.  It's more than that.  I recommend it.",1324598400,6,2888,4.72

4582999,5,B00561BNJK,"I'm not going to attempt to summarize the plot of this film, as I don't believe a summary can adequately convey the feelings the film evokes - no more, anyway, than you could use the written word to convey the melody of a piece of music, or the appearance of a painting.  But what I will say, is that if you have compassion... if you are a romantic... if you have empathy and understanding in equal measure... and you appreciate the deft use of metaphor and imagery by an author who really knows how to turn a phrase, you will be touched by this movie.  Touched and entertained, saddened and gladdened.  If you are looking for something different than this (a math tutorial, a vehicle for inspiring math students, or a documentary dealing with mental illness - as several of the other reviewers apparently were) you'll want to look elsewhere.  One last comment: the first thing I did after watching this movie tonight, was come to Amazon.com and order both the DVD and the novel upon which it was based.

I cannot even imagine someone producing it.
It is bizarre, with a story line that is totally insulting to any math or science teacher. The characters in this movie are not even close to reproducing  a snapshot of a mathematics teacher.
I watched it for a much longer time than than I wanted to do so- hoping for something that would be redeeming. There is NOTHING.
Better throw the cost of this movie down the toilet. This movie is so disgusting and totally insulting to teachers and math education.

4583001,1,B00561BNJK,"Nothing creatively plotted or deeply thoughtful or realistic or scripted or acted well in this movie. The neurosis and other psychological symptoms/behaviors were inaccurate as well as poorly acted. I've seen much more realistic and interesting behavior in institutional settings. Tossing an individual into a classroom to teach without experience, credentials or background just doesn't happen. The degree to which a classroom is out of control as shown in the movie would have had the teacher dismissed within three days. The stand in a corner punishment routines not only haven't been used for decades but are counterproductive. The lack of monitoring by administration in bringing items like an ax into a classroom is as bizarre as much as it is not real. The lesson plans shown were meaningless. And, putting a couple of addition or multiplication problems on a blackboard represents poor teaching. Ughhh! Overall, just poor attention to detail and research by the writer and director.

The plot line of dysfunctional adults whether teachers, parents or others in the movie seemed hackneyed and edited like a collage to make a story for no other reason than to create some bizarre dramatic effect. The script was so contrived and artificial it seemed like the actors were refraining themselves from laughing before reciting their lines. The subplot of romance between the math and science teacher not only added nothing to the central storyline of a teacher finding herself while helping a student seemed like some sophomoric high school teacher-sex plot line. The next pairing will be the music and art teacher followed by romance in the dramatic arts department and literature department. Dumb!

Complete storyline in (<10 words): Math and science teachers have sex; adopt student. Suggest seeing instead,""Terri""; more realistic educational and issues solving storyline.",1320796800,6,1877,5.359322033898305

8459050,5,B00561BNJK,"Don't understand why so many people don't like this movie but after a brief reconsideration I do. It is not a typical romance. It is not a typical feel-good movie. There is no real gratuitous violence. No nudity. No swearing - well maybe a little.

As another reviewer mentioned it is necessary suspend disbelief on a couple of points, but all in all I really like this movie.

One or two reviewers didn't understand the reason for the story/movie. Let's see, very briefly - Learning to deal with situations beyond your control. Learning acceptance (on many levels). Coming to terms with inner turmoil. Learning to let go. LOVE. CARING. UNDERSTANDING. Empathy. Sympathy.

The story has many happy scenes. Many scenes can be distressing but they are tempered with a bit of humor. If you can give yourself over to the story and believe in the characters you will go on an emotional roller coaster and be better for it in the end. There are scenes that will make you laugh out loud, scenes that will tear your heart out.

If you are the type of person who likes independent films. Films that are not the run-of-the-mill Hollywood tripe. You will appreciate this odd, quirky, loveable film.",1525564800,,1186,4.742718446601942
